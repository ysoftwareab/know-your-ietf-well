Internet-Draft             PVD Identification              February 2015


1.  Introduction

   The MIF working group is producing a solution to solve the issues
   that are associated with nodes that can be attached to multiple
   networks based on the Multiple Provisioning Domains (MPVD)
   architecture work [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-arch].  This document describes
   a format for carrying identification information along with a few
   alternatives for reasonable sources for Provisioning Domain (PVD)
   identification.  Since the PVD identities (PVD ID) are expected to be
   unique, the identification sources provide some level of uniqueness
   using either a hierarchical structure (e.g.  FQDNs and OIDs) or some
   form of randomness (e.g.  UUID and ULAs).  Any source that does not
   provide either guaranteed or probabilistic uniqueness is probably not
   a good candidate for identifying provisioning domains.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Provisioning domain identity format

   The identity of the PVD is independent of the configuration protocol
   used to communicate it.  Furthermore, the PVD identity SHOULD only
   contain information related to the identification purposes and not
   encode additional provisioning domain specific configuration
   information.  The used configuration protocol and its extensions are
   meant for that purpose [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-dhcp-support]
   [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-ndp-support].  The PVD identity is formatted as
   follows.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    id-type    |   id-length   |                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
   +                    PVD identity information                   +
   .                       (variable length)                       .

Internet-Draft             PVD Identification              February 2015


    o  id-type: Describes the type of identification information.
       This document defines six types of PVD identity information
         0x01: UUID [RFC4122]
         0x02: UTF-8 string
         0x03: OID [OID]
         0x04: NAI Realm [RFC4282]
         0x05: FQDN
         0x06: ULA Prefix [RFC4193]
         Further types can be added by IANA action.

    o  id-length: Length of the PVD identification  in octets
       not including the id-type and id-length fields.

    o  PVD identity information: The PVD identification that is
       based on the id-type.


4.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to modify the PVD identity provided in a
   configuration protocol.  These attacks can be prevented by using the
   configuration protocol mechanisms such as SEND [RFC3971] and DHCPv6
   AUTH option [RFC3315] that detect any form of tampering with the
   configuration.

   A compromised configuration source, on the other hand, cannot easily
   be detected by a configuration client.  The only real way to avoid
   this is that the PVD identification is directly associable to some
   form of authentication and authorization information from the owner
   of the PVD (e.g. an FQDN can be associated with a DANE cert).  Then,
   this attack can be detected by the client by verifying the
   authentication and authorization information provided inside the PVD
   container option after [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-dhcp-support]
   [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-ndp-support] verifying its trust towards the PVD
   owner (e.g. a certificate with a well-known/common trust anchor
   that).


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new registry for PVD id types.  The initial
   values are listed below

         0x01: UUID [RFC4122]
         0x02: UTF-8 string
         0x03: OID [OID]
         0x04: NAI Realm [RFC4282]
         0x05: FQDN
