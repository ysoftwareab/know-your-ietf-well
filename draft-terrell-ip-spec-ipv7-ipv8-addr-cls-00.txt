Abstract

This paper is a direct result, necessitated by the correction of the
mathematical anomaly that plague IPv4. However, the resolution of
this problem which sought an end to the disparities resulting from
a shortage of available IP Addresses. Did not seem to garner the
unfledging support, through the suggestion of an alternate IP system
of addressing. As presented in the paper entitled; "The Mathematical
Reality of IP Addressing in IPv4 Questions the need for Another IP
System of Addressing".

Needless to say, it is thought that a greater clarification of the
underlining foundation of this subject matter is that which is
needed. Notwithstanding my personal beliefs, that the promises made
by the IT Industry itself, will not be forth coming if an adequate
IP System of Addressing is not employed.

Nevertheless, the Overview is an attempt to provide the reader with
a succinct introductory foundation of those aspects of the Internet
Protocol that will change as a direct result of the implementation
of either IPv7 or IPv8. In other words, I shall present only those
aspects of IPv4 that deal with its methods of Addressing and its
former Class Structure. However, while admitting this would be an
over simplification of its functional use or purpose, and a serious
reduction of an adequate explanation of a vast majority the
foundational information encompassing the IP Specification. It is
nevertheless, seen justifiable, because the remaining aspects
concerning the IP Specification will not change, and shall retain
their functional use regardless of whether or not these systems are
employed. However, there will not be any analysis, which would
propose a mandate for implementation of either of these IP Addressing
Systems, as the suitable replacement of IPv4. That is to say, not
unless the foundations as presented by this work, become the Standard
chosen after an extensive review and comprehensive analysis by the
members of the committee for the IESG and IETF.

In short, the analysis providing the support for a further
exploitation of IPv4 has been presented, and the information provided
in the remaining chapters of this paper shall entertain only the
aspects of IPv7 and IPv8 which differ from that of IPv4. This
however, does not include the chapter dealing with Subnetting.
Especially since, there is a significant difference, and an argument
can be made that would warrant not only a comparative analysis, but
support for its justification as well.

Overview

There are only two main aspects of IPv4 addressing in the IP
Specification that warrant mention; that being Addressing and
Fragmentation. However, since the methods employed in fragmentation
and the IP Specifications dealing with the interaction with other
Protocols or its Modules, will not change as such, they will not be
a subject entertained in this Overview. Where by, the matters that
are presented in brief. Which entertains our present concerns, deal
only with the subject matters of the IP Specifications that encompass
the Class and the Classless Systems, and their functional use as
employed in the IP Addressing of the current system.

Nevertheless, the current IP Specification methodology for IP
addressing in the IPv4 Addressing Scheme is the 'CLASSLESS System'.
Needless to say, while the IP Specifications employing the 'CLASS
System' in the IPv4 Addressing Scheme are no longer used. There are
however, similarities remaining in each of these systems. In which
they share a common foundation, and are still used in the IP
Specification for IP Addressing. Where by, the shared practices,
descriptions, and methodologies of each system is identified as
being: 'The IPv4 Class Address Range'; 'The 32 Bit IP Address
Format'; 'The Method for Subnetting'; 'The Principle of the Octet';
and 'The Binary and Decimal representations of the IP Address'.

However, notwithstanding the treatment which will be rendered to each
in this overview. There will also be a section outlining there
differences as well.

The Binary and Decimal representations in the IP
Address

The Binary and Decimal representations are two different mathematical
systems of enumeration. In which the Binary Representation is a
Mathematical System dealing with the operations of Logical
Expressions having only two states, which can be translated to
represent Integers and Fractions. While the Decimal Representation,
is a Mathematical System involving the operations of Integers, and
can only represent the Whole Numbers used in Counting. Nevertheless,
in spite of the existing differences. These mathematical systems are
shared and used by both, the Class and Classless Systems.

The difference however, underlies the structure of their respective
Mathematical Systems. In other words, only two Binary Representations
exist, that being a 1 or a 0. However, the combined use of One's and
Zero's in a series, can be used to represent any Integer. That is,
for some representative combination of 1's and 0's in a series, there
can exist one and only Integer, in which this Series is Equal to.
Even then, a Mathematical Equation involving the Integers must exist,
which would 'Translate' this Binary Representation into its Decimal
(Integer) Equivalent. In which case, the result would be an
enumeration representing 'One-to-One' Correspondence that is an
Expression of Equality. In which two different systems represent the
same quantity. Nonetheless, each would retain an independence from
the other, in any quantitative result of their employ, governed by
the Mathematical Laws specific to their operation.

Nevertheless, the mathematical operation used to perform this
Translation between the Binary and Decimal representations is
Multiplication. In which the equation is an Exponential Operation
involving Integers. Where by, for every Translation of any Decimal
(Integer) number is given by Table 1.

                              TABLE 1.

                  4     3     2     1
                  X     X     X     X <---------|
                  |     |     |     |           |
                  |     |     |     |           v
    1.            |     |     |     |<---> 2^0 = B x 2^0
                  |     |     |
    2.            |     |     |<---------> 2^1 = B x 2^1
                  |     |
    3.            |     |<---------------> 2^2 = B x 2^2
                  |
    4.            |<---------------------> 2^3 = B x 2^3

Where it is given that, the value of B represents the Binary
representation of either a 1 or a 0. Which will equal the value of
X (the top of the Table). Needless to say, it should be clear that
any Decimal (Integer Value) can be represented using this method.
Where by, a Binary value of 1, in the B column of equation 1, is a
Binary value of 1 for its corresponding X, and the result of the
equation is the Decimal (Integer value) value equal to 1. Hence,
the Decimal representation is equal to the Sum of the results from
the Equations for which the value of X equals 1, and this process
proceeds from the Left to the Right.

Nonetheless, while the process of Translating a Decimal (Integer
value) number to its Binary equivalent is a little more involved,
it is nonetheless this process (Noted above) in the reverse. Which
is shown in Table 2.

                           TABLE 2.

                  4     3     2     1
                  X     X     X     X <-------> |
                  |     |     |     |           |
                  |     |     |     |           v
    1.            |     |     |     |<---> 2^0 = D - (B x 2^0) = Y
                  |     |     |
    2.            |     |     |<---------> 2^1 = D - (B x 2^1) = Y
                  |     |
    3.            |     |<---------------> 2^2 = D - (B x 2^2) = Y
                  |
    4.            |<---------------------> 2^3 = D - (B x 2^3) = Y

In other words, the Reverse process proceeds from the Right to the
Left. Which means, according to the corresponding equations, 'the
Binary Representation of any Decimal Number D, is equal to the
Decimal number (D) minus the Highest Value of the Exponential
Equation yielding a Positive Number, Y. Until the value of their
Difference, Y, at some point, is Equal to Zero.
(Clearly Y is a Variable Integer)

Nevertheless, it is clearly a conclusion, as noted in the Tables
above, that the Binary Representation of an extremely large Integer
number, would indeed, be a very long series of 1's and 0's.
Especially since, 1 and 0 are the only numbers of these mathematical
systems in which the equality of a One-to-One correspondence exist
without the need for a mathematical Translation.

Notwithstanding the fact that the Tables above used examples without
any specifics or consideration regarding parameters. Nonetheless,
in the IPv4 Addressing System, the Boundary's imposed upon the size
of the Binary Series and the Range of the Decimal (Integer Values)
Representations, help to define the 32 Bit Address Range of the
Internet Protocol. Where by, there can only be 8 Bits (Binary 1's
and or 0's) in a Binary Series, which provides, in Translation, a
Decimal Range of 1 - 255, inclusive.

Furthermore, it can also be concluded that the lack of a direct
correlation between the 8 digit and 3 digit displacements that are
the foundations of these respective systems, can not be achieved
without some form of Translation or multiplication Factor. Which
would render these respective displacements Equivalent. However, it
should be clearly noted. There is soundness in any argument for
logical foundation that would support such a justification.

In other words, while it is clear that this Digital Representation
is an existing difference between them. It should also be understood,
that even without Translation they each can only represent one Integer
Value. Needless to say, there abounds the possibility of Error in the
Calculations involving either of these systems. Especially when
either of these Mathematical Systems, are used to represent or
determine some resulting value of the other. That is, errors become
impossible to avoid without performing the necessary Translation to
achieve the One-to-One correspondence, which maps accurately the
Total count of one system to that of other. Saying the very least
however, it seems to me, the choice would be to allow either the
Machine to manipulate the Binary Numbers, or calculate using only
the Decimal numbers, then translate the result to a Binary
Representation.

The 32 Bit Address Format and the Principle of the
Octet

The 32 Bit Address Format in use today, comprises 4 sections, each
having a Binary Series of 8 Bits which can be any combination of
1's and 0's. Hence the name, Octet, represents the 8 Bit Binary
representation, of which there are 4 that make up the 32 Bit Address
Format. Nevertheless, its Decimal Translation, yields a Dotted
Notation having an Integer Range of 0 - 255 inclusive.

The IPv4 Address Class System

The IP Class System, while somewhat blurred through the use of the
Subnet Mask in the Supernetting methodology of the Classless System,
it has not yet, lost the significance of its use.

Nevertheless, it is given by the defacto Standard, that the IP Class
of a given Network Address is determined by the Decimal value of the
First Octet relative to the IP Address Class Range in which it is
associated. This method is used in conjunction with the Default
Subnet Mask to determine the total number of IP Addresses available
for the calculation of the total number of Networks and Hosts, and
their distribution counts for every IP Address Range. Where by, the
Default Subnet Mask maintains a Decimal value of 255 for every Octet
in which it is assigned. This Decimal value translates to a Binary
Representation of all 1's, or 8 Binary 1's (11111111) in every Octet
in which it is used. However, the mathematical method employed to
resolve the Network IP Address in which the Default Subnet Mask is
associated, is called BITWISE ANDING. Nonetheless, Bitwise Anding is
a mathematical operation involving the Binary System, and is given
by Table 3.

                            TABLE 3

1.      1 and 1 = 1
2.      1 and 0 = 0
3.      0 and 0 = 0

Where by, the process of BITWISE ANDING is a Machine calculation
that can be performed by anyone. Its functional purpose is the
resolution of an IP Address, which can be either a Network or an
associated Host.

Nevertheless, the IP Class structure while providing a count of the
total Networks and Hosts for each IP Class, as shown in Table 4.
It additionally provided the IPv4 Addressing System with a structure,
methodology, and a small set of rules to govern the distribution,
deployment, and management of IP Addresses within any given
Internetwork or Network domain. Nonetheless, Table 5 provides the
description of its Binary interpretation, which is related to the
number of available Binary Digits that can be used, when translated,
to determine the Decimal Notation an IP Address, and the total number
of addresses available.

                         Table 4.

     Structure of the IPv4 Representation IP Class System

     Class A, 1 - 126, Default Subnet Mask 255.y.y.y:
              126 Networks and 16,777,216 Hosts: 0

     Class B, 128- 191, Default Subnet Mask 255.255.y.y:
              16,384 Networks and 32,004 Hosts: 10

     Class C, 192 - 223, Default Subnet Mask 255.255.255.y:
              2,097,151 Networks and 254 Hosts: 110

                         Table 5

1.      Class A: 1 - 126, with 8 Bit Network Count and 24 Bit Host
      count ; Where 0 (Zero ) and 127 reserved unknown Network and
      loopback

2.      Class B: 128 - 191, with 14 Bit Network Count and
      16 Bit Host count

3.      Class C: 192 - 223, with 24 Bit Network Count and
      8 Bit Host count

   4. Class D: 224 - 239 ; Used for Multicasting, Host
      count not applicable

   5. Class E: 240 - 254 ; Denoting Experimental, Host
      counts not applicable

Note: There is no Division of Classes D or E. In fact, their
      definitions provide descriptions of their functional use.

The Rules that enabled and govern the structure of the IPv4
Addressing System, are indeed laws. Where by, either the Internetwork
or Networking Domain could become disabled, if a violation of any one
or more of these laws occurred. Nevertheless, the laws as outlined in
Table 6, represents a Set of Restrictions and their, regarding the
Binary and Decimal values assigned to a given IP Address. However,
any further, or more detailed analysis of Table 6 would be
superfluous, because the presentation itself, is a definition.

Nevertheless, notwithstanding the benefits that the hierarchical
organizational structure of the IPv4 Class Addressing Scheme provided
the Networking Community as a whole. The treatment rendered,
regarding its explanation, while somewhat shallow, shall suffice as
the grounding foundation for the overall purposes and objectives of
this presentation.

                            TABLE 6

1.      The Network Address portion of an IP address cannot be Set to
      either all Binary Ones or All Binary Zeros

2.      The Subnet portion of an IP address cannot be Set to either
      All Binary Ones or All Binary Zeros

3.      The Host portion of an IP address cannot be Set to All Binary
      Ones or All Binary Zeros

4.      The IP address 127.x.x.x can never be assigned as a Network
      Address

The Differences between the Class and the Classless
Systems

The fall of the IPv4 Class System of Addressing, as such, is viewed
as resulting from the lack of IP Addresses available for distribution
and servicing the every growing Global Internetworking Community.
However, the Internet Draft from which this  results, describes an
alternate view of the reality of its fall. Nevertheless, the IPv4
Class System has been described as an Organized Hierarchical Class
Structure. But, this not a definitive depiction, noting that there
are parts yet remaining within the IPv4 Class System, that are indeed
wanting of a more conclusive and exacting definition of their
functional purpose.

This however, becomes even more apparent upon analysis of the use of
Default Subnet Mask for the Class B. That is, when compared with the
results of Appendix II and the definition of the use and purpose of
the Default Subnet Mask. Where by, it is clear from the definition
of the Default Subnet Mask. That its purpose defines the location
of the Octet, which is assigned some Decimal Value from the IP
Address Class Range. While, one of it uses, is the identification or
resolution of a Network or Host IP Address. But clearly, this is not
sufficient. Because this implies that only the first Octet of any
given IP Address, maintains the right relative to the IP Address
Range, to define the IP Class to which any given IP Address belongs.
In other words, given the Class B as our example. Which has a Default
Subnet Mask of 255.255.000.000. Then, given the results, as that
given by equation 1a. We could conceivably derive two different
Decimal Values, which would be an equally accurate determination of
the number of Networks present in Class B. That is, provided there
does not exist a more precise definition, and or, functional use of
the Default Subnet Mask.

     1a. 64 x 254 = 16,256   "OR"   64 x 64 = 4,096

       (That is, given that: Class B 128 - 191,
          Default Subnet Mask 255.255.000.000)

Needless to say, regardless of the method employed, they are clearly
different numerical values representing the same object, which are
indeed less than the Binary value given by 2^14 (16,384). Furthermore,
without the indulgence of another example, this conclusion is
applicable to the Class C as well. (This problem is eliminated in
IPv7.)

Nevertheless, the concept of Masking and its inverse,'Un-Masking',
deserves some attention. That is, the Subnet Mask, which is the
Catalysis for this presentation, is used by both of these Systems,
the Class and Classless. However, it is the concept of the Subnet
Mask, as it shall be discovered, which maintains a far greater
significance when distinguishing the difference between these two
Systems.

Notwithstanding, the notion, idea, or evolution of the Class System
would have been a resulting consequence, predicated by some
inseparable component regardless. Where by, the misnomer,
'Classless', is not the existing difference, which mandates the
defining distinction that separates these Systems. Needless to say,
the doubt, which the underpinning of this conclusion surmounts, is
the functional definition and the associated boundaries of the IP
Class Addressing System. Which is indeed, the IP Addressing
Divisional Methodology employed by each of these Systems.
Nonetheless, without any support outlining or defining a Structure,
one such component whose defined function, which would have caused
the predestine evolution each, is indeed that of the Subnet Mask.
(But! What are the losses? Or trade-offs of this implementation?)

Nevertheless, the associated problems concerning IP Address
availability were resolved through the creation of another
Sub-Division of the Subnet Mask. Which indeed, is the
'DEBARKATION LINE', defining the difference between these Systems.
However, this was a two-phase progression, involving two divisions
of the Subnet Mask, the VLSM and the SUPERNETTING of the Class C,
CIDR. Nevertheless, Supernetting maintains the distinction as being
the USHER for the Classless. That is, the underlining difference
distinguishing these Systems. It does moreover, impose a barrier,
which limits the overview's presentation to the relevance pertaining
thereto. Nonetheless, it is worthy of mention, noting that
Supernetting can be viewed as a refinement of VLSM, Variable
Length Subnet Mask.

The promises of Supernetting, when viewed from its exploitation of
the Class C, as relinquishing the dependence upon the Class
Structured System, can be realized only if this application is
applied to the remaining Classes. At least, this is the current and
accepted outline of the Populist's view of the objectives presented.
Notwithstanding, the most discomforting drawback encompassing this
objective, is the elimination of the process and use of the Default
Subnet Mask. Which ultimately means, the redefining of the functional
use of all Binary 1's and 0's within the any given Octet, and the
loss of the Logical Structure in IP Addressing as well. Nevertheless,
there is indeed a warrant for an analysis of the process of
Supernetting, which transcends the obligations of this overview.
Needless to say, the foundational support of this argument is the
underlining objectives found upon the Internet Draft upon which of
this presentation resides.

Nonetheless, prior to the analysis and investigation of Supernetting,
a brief introduction of some of the foundational principles of
Subnetting, from which Supernetting is derived, is required.

The Binary Representation of 1's and 0's, and the specific rules for
their combination or usage, is the chosen form of communication used
in Machine Language. The principles of BITWISE ANDING was presented
in the section entitled, "The IPv4 Address Class System", which is
the mathematical method used by the Computer when the Subnet Mask
or the Default Subnet Mask is used to resolve either a Network or
Host IP Address. That is, if you were given a Decimal Network IP
Address of 172.16.182.19, the Machine or Computer could not read nor
translate these Integers into any usable format. That is to say,
there is a Translator for the Input and Output for the Computer,
because its language is of the Binary Format. In other words, the
Computer would read the Input of the IP Address, 172.16.182.19, as
that given by figure 1.

                Figure 1
    Bit Map of the 32 Bit IP Address

 10101100    00010000    10110110    00010011

However, through the use of the Default Subnet Mask, 255.255.255.000,
and its Binary translation, as given in figure 2. The Computer or
Router could, through the use of Bitwise Anding resolve the Network
Address for the given IP Address, as shown in figure 3. Whose Decimal
translation through the Binary Mathematics of Bitwise Anding would
yields the Network IP Address as, 172.16.182.000.

             Figure 2
    Bit Map of the 32 Bit IP Address

11111111    11111111    11111111    00000000

                  Figure 3
       Bit Map of the 32 Bit IP Address

 10101100    00010000    10110110    00000000

Nevertheless, there are several advantages that can be ascertained
through the use of the Subnet Mask, and even more, if the mathematics
of Bitwise Anding remain same. In other words, the problems
associated with the difference between the Binary and Decimal methods
of enumeration do not exist within the Machine's Mathematical
Calculations for the Translation into the Binary format. That is,
the Binary Format allows for the manipulation of individual BITS.
Where by, the resulting Decimal Translation could be either a
Fraction or an Integer. In which case, it is assumed that any
resulting Fractional Component produces a Range of possible Subnet
numbers in which several Network IP Addresses might belong.
(Supernetting)

Nonetheless, the Breaking-Up, or the division of any Network into
smaller Sub-Networks, is called Subnetting. Which is accomplished
through the use of the Subnet Mask. Where the Subnet Mask can be
used or mapped onto any Octet, except the first Octet, which is
used to identify the Address Class Range to which a particular IP
Address might belong. Needless to say, there is a De Facto process
by which a Subnet Number is chosen, and these numbers are given in
Table 7.

                             TABLE 7

Note: The 'Asterisk' represents Values that can not
      be used by the OCTET, which is define by the
      'Subnet Mask' Although, this is not a Law.

Nonetheless, the first example of the use of the Subnet was that of
the Default Subnet Mask, which was used with the Binary Mathematical
operation of Bitwise Anding to resolve the Network IP Address.
However, from the list summarized by Table 7, the Subnetting concept
can be further expanded, and use in an example to demonstrate the
division of a Network Address into several smaller Network Addresses.
That is, if given the Parent Network IP Address of '172.16.0.0', for
which smaller Subdivisions are sought. This being the conclusion
based upon an examination of the over all Network performance and
needs. Then the appropriate Subnet Mask can be derived from the 7
choices given by Table 7 based upon the conclusions. Wherefore, if
'252' is chosen, the IP address of this Decimal Number corresponds
to the Subnet Mask given by an IP Address of '225.255.252.0'. In
which a total number of 63 available Subnets can be generated from
'252'. Which is the result generated by its (252) division by the
factor determined as being the value of the Least Significant Bit
of its Binary Representation (4). However, the inclusive count
would maintain a composite value equal 64, which includes 252 in
the total.

Nevertheless, the resulting Subnet IP Addresses generated would be
determined by sequential additions of the Least Significant Bit (4)
to the Parent IP Network Address. Which also determine number of
hosts per Subnet, and is summarized in Table 7.

Notwithstanding, that the example above was a demonstration of the
concepts and underlining the principles of Subnetting. However,
its principles and concepts needless to say, is the foundation of
which the principles underlining the concept of Supernetting is
derived. Moreover, since it is the First Octet that is reserved
for the Identification of the IP Address Class to which any IP
Address belongs. The example chosen could have been selected from
any one of the 3 primary IP Address Classes. Hence, Supernetting
is the Subnetting of an IP Address having the Default Skeletal
Structure as defined for the Class A. (The depiction rendered by
this conclusion, is summarized in Table 8 of the next chapter.)

The concepts for the principles and beliefs in the Classless System,
in closing, is a derivation from the concepts of CLASSLESS
INTERDOMAIN ROUTING (CIDR). In which, the basic strategy is the
AGGREGATION of Multiple Divisions of an IP Address Class into One
Network. Whose size would exceed that of the initial IP Address
Class, and could be Routable using a 'One Route Path' for its
thoroughfare. In other words, the only real difference between the
CLASS and CLASSLESS Systems is that of the Routing Methodology they
employ.

Chapter I:An Overview of IPv7 the Expansion of Ipv4

The suitable replacement for IPv4 is IPv7, because it provides a
greater adherence to the rules of any logical system having an
underlining mathematical foundation. Furthermore, while the
differences are small modifications to its foundational structure.
It is nonetheless, an exploitation and expansion of IPv4. Which
the analysis of Tables 4, 5, and 6, including the concepts of
Supernetting, produces the results in Table 8 that provide the
justification for the results of Table 9. In other words, the vast
majority of the grounding principles and applications of IPv4 would
be the same in IPv7.

Nonetheless, it should be reasonably clear, that a Logical Foundation
is the mandated requirement for any system to maintain longevity as
an Organized Hierarchical Class Structure. In which case, the words
'De FACTO' and 'De JURE' would not have any relevant significance.
Which would warrant the acceptance or use, of some standard that
has no rational or logical foundation of its structure or application.
Notwithstanding however, the Naming convention is arbitrary. That is,
to avoid the problems associated with encoding '4.2', since IPv6 is
being used, IPv7 was the next logical choice.

              Table 8.
" The Reality resulting from Supernetting, the
    combination of TABLES 4 and 5 yields"

Total Number of IP Addresses Available:
         15 x 16,777,216 = 251,658,240

Note: Without having the Default Subnet Masking Define as limiting
      the values of the Octet to the Address Range of the Class
      in which it is mapped. Then, only the Value of the First
      Octet in any IP Address can Determine the IP Address Class
      of which, the resulting IP Address might belong. This means
      that, the Total number of IP Addresses available is equal
      to the Binary Bit Count of the Address Range multiplied
      by the Host Bit Count, 2^24. That is, every Class can
      maintain the Default IP Address as given for the Class A,
      which justifies the Expansion as given in Table 7.

Note: The Equation for Determining the IP Address Range for any IP
      Class is; (REN - RBN) + 1 = Total of Available IP Addresses for
      the given Class. (Where R = Range, E = End, B = Beginning,
      N = Number)

However, the resulting expansion, that is IPv7, as summarized in
Table 9 raises an issue, while not a major problem. It does indeed,
represent a Mathematical Conflict within the of IPv7 Class Addressing
Scheme, as depicted in Table 9. Where by, the Mathematics Analysis
reveals that the Second Octet of the Primary Section of Each Class
maintains a Set of Values within each of their respective IP Address
Ranges. Which can not be employed or used as part of the count
resulting in the total number of available IP Addresses. This is
because they are not available as a valid IP Address, and if they
were, then there would exist a mathematical conflict with the
calculation of the total number of available IP Addresses of the
Secondary Section for each IP Address Class. In other words, there
would arise an error in reporting the results of the calculated
totals. This can easily visualized when compared with the results
of the second Octet of the Secondary Section for each of the IPv7
Class Address Ranges. That is, there exist a barrier imposed by the
use of the Subnet Identifier of the second Octet from the Secondary
Section of each IPv7 Class Address Schemes, with bars the use of
any of the numbers given by the IP Address Range for that given IP
Address Class. This is seen true, because the 1 - 254 total Host
Count, does indeed contain all of the numbers available to be used
as IP Addresses. However, this does not cripple the IPv7 Class
Addressing System. Where by, the calculation of the mathematical
difference between IP Address Range for each Class and the total
Host count would yield the valid Address Range that can be use to
calculate that total number of  available IP Addresses. This however,
is provided that there exist a distinction between, and definitions
for the 'Default Subnet Mask', the 'Subnet Mask', and the 'Subnet
Identifier', which are given below.

                           Definitions

1.  The Subnet Identifier defines the Default Subnet Mask and the
    Octet, which can only be assigned the values specified by in
    the IP Class Address Range within boundaries of IP Address
    Class in which it is used.

2. The Default Subnet Mask has a Binary value of 11111111 and a
   Decimal value of 255, it is used calculate the IP Network
   Address and to map the location of the Network portion of the
   IP Address defined by the Subnet Identifier.

3. The Subnet Mask is used to divide any Parent Network IP Address
   into several smaller and Logical Sub-Networks. When used in
   conjunction with the Default Subnet Mask, it identifies the
   resulting Sub-Network IP Address it was used to create.

Nonetheless, the analysis of mathematical procedures for the
elimination of this discrepancy is achieved by definitions resulting
from the Laws of the Octet, which are summarized in Table 10.

                             TABLE 10

                     {" The Laws of the Octet "}

1. By definition, there exist 3 distinct Sections or Divisions
   for every IP Address Class. However, the number of Sections
   or Divisions is dependent upon IP Bit Address Range defined
   for the IP Address.

2. The Sections or Divisions of the IP Address Class are defined
   as: Primary, Secondary, Ternary, etc‡And are labeled according
   to their respective Class Location (e.g.: Class A would be Class
   A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, and continued as    would be necessary
   to distinguish the remaining Classes, B - E.)

3. The Subnet Identifier assigns to any Octet it defines in any
   Section or Division of every IP Class, when not use as the
   Default Subnet Mask, only the value of the numbers available
   in the IP Address Range assigned to that IP Class.

4. For every OCTET in any Section or Division of any IP Class
   that the Subnet Identifier does not define, can be assigned
   any value in the range of 1 - 254. That is, provided that
   there is no succeeding Section or Division, or if, there is
   an OCTET in a succeeding Section or Division, whose reference
   is the same, then it can not be defined by the Subnet
   Identifier. {This is seen true, because the Octet of this
   Section or Division, could not be in a Succeeding Section or
   Division which the Subnet Identifier can define.}

5. For every OCTET within any Section or Division of any IP
   Class, that is defined by the Subnet Identifier and is
   preceded by a Section or Division whose reference is the
   same Octet. Where the case is such that, the Octet of the
   preceding Section or Division is not defined by the Subnet
   Identifier. Then the Octet of the preceding Section, or
   Division, can not be assigned any value as given by the IP
   Address Range assigned to that IP Class.

Needless to say, this situation can be further explored, through
mathematical calculations. Where in the given example in this case
would be Class A-1 and Class A-2.

1.  Class A-1, 1 - 126, Subnet Identifier 255.000.000.000:
    126 Networks and 254^3 Hosts: 0

2.  Class A-2, 1- 126, Subnet Identifier 255.255.000.000:
    126^2 Networks and 254^2 Hosts: 10

Nevertheless, the examination of these classes yields the conclusion.
That if Class A-1's second Octet were to maintain any of the values
in the IP Address Range, 1 - 126, then it would be reporting IP
Address of Class A-2 because the second Octet of this Class is
defined by the Subnet Identifier. However, the easiest mathematical
method for the determination of the total number of available IP
Addresses from Class A-1 would be to calculate the total number of
IP Addresses available from its original configuration. Then subtract
the value as would be determined from the calculation of the
Class A-1 IP Address configuration that can not be used. In
which case, we have:

          3. Class A-1, 1 - 126, Subnet Identifier 255.126.000.000:
             126 Networks and 254^2 Hosts: 0

            4.   126 * (254)^2 = 8,129,016

Where the total, would be that given as:

           5.   126 * (254)^3 = 2,064,770,064

In other words, the total number of available IP Addresses in
Class A-1, that could be assigned as a Global (Parent) Network IP
Address for connection to the Internetwork (That is, other than
for use in a Private Domain Network), would be the difference
between these equations. As given by:

       6.   2,064,770,064 - 8,128,016 = 2,056,641,048

This method is summarized in Table 11. Where the results of equation
6 equals the total number of IP Addresses available for assignment
as a Parent Network in a Global Internetworking Environment, and
the results of equation 4 yield the number of Hosts that can be
repeatedly assigned and used as private Domain Network IP Addresses.
In which case, one would need to access the Parent Network to have
access to any of these internal private Networks and Hosts identified
by these IP Addresses. Thus, there would be no conflict from there
continued use, which is the process now employed.

   1,040,384 Networks and 252, or X = 0, 253 Hosts

5. Class E-1, 240 - 254, Subnet Identifier 255.x.x.y:

   857,250 Networks and 252, or X = 0, 253 Hosts

Note: The Rules given in Table 6 and Table 10 (Laws of the
      Octet) Limits the Range for the Value of the Variable
      'X'. That is, when 'X' represents the HOST, then the
      Range of Values that 'X' can be assigned is given by
      the Equation:
      {X | If X = Y, then X = ([256 - 4] + 1)}.
      (X can never be Equal to the Numbers; 256, 255, 111,
      or 000) That is, if and only if, there exist no
      condition where 'X = N = Y', and N = the Octet defined
      by the Network IP Address, where when true, then
      {X | X = ([256 - 5] + 1)}
      However, when 'X' represents the Network, then the
      Range of Values that 'X' can be assigned is governed
      by the Laws of the Octet (Table ??) and given by the
      Equations: {X | If X = Y, then X = ([256 - 3] + 1)},
      where 'X' can never be assigned the values, 256, 255,
      or 111. Or {X = X | If X = N, then ([256 - 2] + 1)},
      where 'X' can Never be assigned the values, 256, or 255.

The Subnetting features of Supernetting did not eliminate the IP
Address Classes it just changed the format of the structure of their
IP Address, which made the Class C become more appealing to the
businesses seeking Global Internetworking Connections. However,
the benefit was indeed significant to distribution and the
availability of IP Addresses. This fact is evinced as a result of the
Class restructuring its use ultimately produced. Which caused an
increase in the number of IP Addresses available of Class B to twice
its original value, and about 12 million for Class C.
However, IPv7 doubles even this amount from its expansion of the IPv4
32 Bit Addressing Scheme. In other words, IPv4 offered approximately
3.12 * 10^9 IP Addresses, and Supernetting increased the number of
available IP Addresses to approximate 3.6 * 10^9. While IPv7, its
expansion given by Table 11, renders the number of available IP
Addresses as being approximately 5.6 * 10^9. Which, to say the very
least, is nearly double the original value, and the IP Address Bit
Range remains '32'. The Binary Representation resulting from the use
of Supernetting and IPv7, is summarized in Table 12 and 13
respectively.

      [(REN - RBN) + 1)]. Moreover, the Sublet Identifier, 255,
      has a Binary Representation of; 11111111.

Nevertheless, by exploiting the Default Subnet Mask, that is,
understanding its real purpose as used in BITWISE ANDING. Which
is IP Network Address Resolution by determining the value of the
defining Octet. Then anyone could easily visualize that, the former
IPv4 Class Addressing Scheme, as summarized in Tables 4 and 5,
warrants the expansion to that given by Table 11. Where the Default
Subnet Mask, now the Subnet Identifier, assumes the duties of its
actual definition. That is, it remains the Default Subnet Mask,
which when used in Bitwise Anding serves to resolve the Network
IP Address. This working definition provides further justification
for the acceptance of IPv7. Especially since, IPv7 can now be viewed
as the expansion of the IP Classes from the change in the Default
Structure defining each division of the IP Class, which resulted from
the use of Supernetting. This produced a change in all of the
Structures of the IP Classes to the Default Structure as depicted
for the Class A. In other words, IPv7's evolution is founded upon
changes made in IPv4, that were used to compensate for the shortages
in the number of available IP Addresses. However, the changes became
the foundational premises of deductive reasoning, for the logical
conclusion, which necessitates IPv7, and offers a cost free solution
for the shortages in the number of available IP Addresses.

Note: Other than the clarification of the functional
      purpose, enhanced specification for the definitions
      of a few terms, and the expansion the of the of IP
      Classes reduced by the use of Supernetting, IPv7 only
      provides a greater logical Structure, because
      nothing else changes as a result of its
      implementation.

Chapter II: An Overview of IPv8 the Enhancement of Ipv7

The over all structure and organization regarding the overview of
IPv8 offers no change to the foundation, as rendering a major
distinction from that underlining IPv7. In other words, it is viewed
as an enhancement of IPv7. Where by, IPv8 offers separate copies of
the IP Addressing Scheme, as summarized in Table 11. Thus, providing
a broader distribution and use of an unlimited number of available IP
Addresses for the population of the entire World. Nevertheless, this
is evinced by IPv7's IP Address Totals is nearly equal to the present
World Population, which is approximately one IP Address assignment
per person.

In other words, the enhancement offered by IPv8 is characterized by
the use and implementation of PREFIXES to the IP Address, such as,
'Country Codes', 'Zone Codes', and 'Area Codes'. The employment of
these measures not only guarantees the promises of the IT Industry,
while reducing the cost of Long Distance Telephone Calls, but offers
a significant boost over the use of 'CIDR' in Router performance, as
shall be discussed in the next chapter.

In other words, the promises of the IT Industry encompassing the
Interactive Television, Live Video Telephone Systems, Video
Teleconferencing, and the evolution of a Global Telecommunication
Community which encompassed everyone having a telephone today,
becomes the Reality of its Dreamers. That is to say, with the
implementation of IPv8, all of the promises of the IT Industry would
now depend only on the development of the technology to produce
these systems.

Chapter III  'The Header Structure in IPv7 & IPv8'

The IP Addressing Scheme of IPv7 can serve the Global Internetworking
Community now. Its implementation offers some significant
improvements over any system presently in use. However, while there
is a learning curve, it would actually impose no challenge for the
seasoned professional. In fact, there are two reasons that support
the its implementation and the reality of it being the suitable
replacement for IPv4.

1.      It provides over 2 Billion additional IP
      Addresses.

2.      Its Header does not change from that used
      in IPv4.

In other words, IPv7 is a system that can be used now, which provides
the ease of use and implementation of IPv4. While at the same time,
providing an almost seamless transition for its enhancement, IPv8.

Nevertheless, while IPv7 is called the "Global Internetworking
Community", IPv8 is called the "Global Telecommunication Community".
The difference however, distinguishing these systems, are two fold.
Where by, the former is a shared IP Addressing System, which utilizes
the Network medium for limited communication. However, the latter
represents a Global Standardization for all Telecommunications
Systems in use today.

The advantages of IPv8 however, surmount far beyond any 32 Bit IP
Addressing System now employed, or ever conceived. Nevertheless,
while retaining the ease of use and implementation of IPv7, IPv8
provides an available number of IP Addresses that's staggering, to
say the very least. In other words, the comparable analogy would be,
IPv7 can provide an IP Address to every individual in the world today.
While IPv8, can provide the same number of people with an individual
IP Address on over 4 Billion worlds. That is to say, the people of
planet Earth can colonize 4 Billion planets with a population equal
to the existing count, and still have reserve IP Addresses.

Nevertheless, while the foundations underlining IPv8 is the same as
those of IPv7. There is indeed a distinction between these two
systems, which accounts for the staggering number of available IP
Addresses. The difference, while similar to IPv6, is the change in
the structure of the IP Header associated with IPv8, and their
depiction is given in Figure 5.

Nevertheless, the obvious lack of a detailed analysis of the Headers
reduces the IPv8 Header to one being that of a suggestion. However,
it is clear that IPv4 and IPv7 can share the same Header. But, from
the structure as offered as choice for the Header of IPv8, an
explanation is indeed warranted. Where by, the over all structure of
the IPv8 Header of figure 5 is similar to that of IPv6, except that
it 'Divides' the Source and Destination Sections of IPv6's Header
Structure. However, its defining purpose is the same as that given for
IPv7. The distinction however, is the addition of two additional
sections, one for the Source and the other for the Destination. These
additions make provisions for a greater individual use and deployment
of this IP Addressing Scheme.

Where by, above the Source Address Section exist another 32 Bit
Section, which is divided into 4 distinct and separately defined
Octets. There are 2 Octets reserved for growth and expansion, and
another is defined as the Source Address Zone, while the last is
defined as the Source IP Address Area Code. The Destination Address
Section also has an additional 32 Bit section, which has comparable
assignments, excepting that, they are defined for the Destination
Address Section. Nevertheless, the numbering system employed for use
in these sections is defined as the same as that governing the IP
System of Address. While the Structure of this addressing system is
given by Figure 6.

                             FIGURE 6

    1. Source Addressing Structure: 255:255:255.000.000.000

    2. Source Addressing Structure: 255:255:255.255.000.000

    3. Source Addressing Structure: 255:255:255.255.255.000

    4. Destination Addressing Structure: 255:255:255.000.000.000

    5. Destination Addressing Structure: 255:255:255.255.000.000

    6. Destination Addressing Structure: 255:255:255.255.255.000

Notice that the Primary, Secondary, and Ternary IP Address Classes
are also shown in addition to that of the Zone and IP Address Area
Codes for the Source and Destination Addresses. Furthermore, it
should be clear that each Octet preceding the IP Address is separated
by a Colon, which not only indicates their distinction but an order
of precedence as well.

In other words, the establishment of a sequential order is another
boon for IPv8. Especially when considering the Routing and networking
implications. Where by, CIDR attempts to improve Router performance
through the use of the Subnet Mask by looking at the Back End of an
Aggregation the IP Address. Thus, allowing a reduction in the size of
the Router's Table, and increasing the thoroughfare by permitting the
assignment of several IP Addresses to this Back End Address. However,
the implementation of IPv8 suggests just the opposite. Where by,
Router's become more specialized Address Forwarding Computers,
consisting of three divisions, the Global, the Internetwork, and
the Network. These three divisions serve to reduce the Router's Table,
reduce Traffic, and enhance System Management. These benefits are
accomplished by programming the Routers to Route using the Front End
of the IP Addresses. Thus, achieving a significant Router performance,
which is a far superior improvement over that which can be achieved
using the CIDR technique.

The reality of these benefits becomes even clearer when an
understanding of Front End Addressing achieved. That is, the Network
Router checks first the Zone Address, then the IP AREA CODE Address.
This allows the Router to determine if the communication is an
Intercom or an Outercom. In which case, if it is Outercom, the Router
needs only to know the location, and or Hop Count, of the nearest
Internetworking or Global Router. Which need only be 2 or 3 connecting
Routes beyond the single Point of Failure.

However, while all Intercom communications are Routed as belonging
somewhere within the Domain of its Network. The only the
communications destine to either the Global or the Internetworking
Telecommunication Community would need to access the Global or
Internetworking Routers, which are located outside the Domain of the
Network. Furthermore, while the Global and Internetworking Routers
employ similar, but the reverse techniques of CIDR, the One Route
Thoroughfare for Multi IP Address Access. The Back End of the IP
Address is not considered until the IP Packet reaches the Gateway
Router of its intended Destination. This clearly offers a boon for
the Telecommunications Internetworking Industry, because the Router's
in place now, only need an up grade of the IOS to perform these tasks.

Notwithstanding the obvious benefits, if IPv8 is implemented as the
Standard for the Global Telecommunication System Interface. A simple
IP Address can become, as planned, the replacement for the Telephone
Numbers in use today, because software could be used to eliminate the
need for anyone to maintain the obligation of having to remember any
number beyond 15 digits. That is, their IP Address and its associated
IP Address Area Code Prefix.

Nevertheless, it should be very clear, by now, that there can exist
254 Zones, which could result in the independent implementation of
the entire IPv8 Addressing Scheme that could have 254 IP Address Area
Codes for each IP Address Class and their associated Divisions.
Needless to say, while the implementation of IPv8 does noting in the
elimination of Subnetting. It does however question, because of the
staggering number of IP Addresses available, the need for
Supernetting. Especially since, only the IP Addresses assigned to the
individual, which is accompanied by its Zone and IP Address Area
Code, could have or maintained access to the Global
Telecommunications System.

Chapter IV The Principles of Subnetting in IPv7 & IPv8

The concepts and principles which underline the methods of Subnetting
and its derivative, Supernetting, will not change. However, there
some additional definitions and laws regarding their usage in IPv7
and IPv8. Nevertheless, these Laws and Definitions is a direct
consequence of the information provided in the Overview, Table 10,
and the definitions derived in Chapter I.

                    Definitions

1. By Definition, every IP BIT Address is divided into sections
   called OCTETS. Where the first OCTET of any IP Bit Address must
   be Defined by the Subnet Identifier, and each Octet equals 8
   Binary representations of either One's or Zero's that can
   collectively be Translated into one Decimal (Integer) Number.

2. Every Octet not defined by the Subnet Identifier, may
   be Defined by the Subnet Mask. Where the value of the Subnet Mask
   is defined as being equal to the resulting Difference Of Success
   Subtractions of the Binary number 1 = 2^0 = X and is given by the
   Equation: [SM = 2^7 - X]. Where by, the Subnet Mask = SM, and
   given by the Difference of each successive Subtraction of 2^0.

3. Every Network IP Address may contain at least one Subnet Mask.
   Where the Total Number of Subnet Mask that it can have, depend
   on the IP Bit Address Range Minus the first Octet in of the IP
   Address.

4. For every IP Address, having one or more Octets defined by the
   Subnet Identifier, also defines any IP Network Address which can
   be Subnetted. Where, if any Logical Division of an IP Network
   Address, creates multiple IP Addresses derived from the original.
   Then the derived IP Addresses are called Sub-Networks of the
   initial IP Address, which is said to be Subnetted. This is
   provided that every OCTET in the IP Bit Address Range is not
   defined by the Subnet Identifier. (Where the Subnet Identifier is
   equal to: 11111111 = 255; The Binary and Decimal Equivalents.).


5. Every Network IP Address having an Octet defined by a Subnet Mask,
   can be subdivided into only 1 Sub-Network. In which, there are
   a total of 7 possible logical Sub-Networks that may be defined.

6. For every Octet defined by the Subnet Mask for any Sub-Network IP
   Address. The Octet referenced as being the IP Network Address
   from which it was derived, can not be assigned any value in the
   IP Address Range of the derived Sub-Network IP Addresses.

7. The Laws of the OCTET are applied to every Octet defined by the
   Subnet Mask. That is, it can not be used in IP Address that would
   result in a conflict with any IP Address, whose Octet is defined
   by the Subnet Identifier.

Where DE = the Decimal Equivalent that is also equal to the (BR)
Binary Representation. That is, the Subnet Mask, can only be
assigned the IP Address values summarized in the Table 7.
Nonetheless, an example of this Binary Difference is given in
Figure 4. Where by, given 2^7 = 11111111 = 255, is the Minuend,
then successive Subtractions of 2^0 = 00000001 = the Subtrahend
from the resulting Difference is equal to the Summary in Table 7.

                         Figure 4

            1. 11111111 - 00000001 = 11111110 = 254

            2. 11111110 - 00000001 = 11111100 = 252

            3. 11111100 - 00000001 = 11111000 = 248

            4. 11111000 - 00000001 = 11110000 = 240

            5. 11110000 - 00000001 = 11100000 = 224

            6. 11100000 - 00000001 = 11000000 = 192

            7. 11000000 - 00000001 = 10000000 = 128

            8. 10000000 - 00000001 = 00000000 =  0

            9. 11111111 - 11111111 = 00000000 =  0

Note: It should be clear that the Binary method of
      Subtraction is quite different from the Bitwise
      Anding method used by the Default Subnet Mask to
      resolve an IP Address.

Nonetheless, there is a logical rationalization for the choice of
the values of the Subnet Mask. Where by, the Binary Equations of
Subtraction yields functional results, which has a 'Least Significant
Digit', that is also the Factor use for the Translation of the Binary
representation to its Decimal (Integer) Equivalent.

                              TABLE 7
              (Modification of Table 7 noted above)
Least Significant Bit: Binary: Decimal: # of Subnets: Host / per

   2^7               10000000     128         1     128 - 1 = 127

   2^6               11000000     192         3      64 - 1 = 63

   2^5               11100000     224         7      32 - 1 = 31

   2^4               11110000     240        15      16 - 1 = 15

   2^3               11111000     248        31       8 - 1 = 7

   2^2               11111100     252        63       4 - 1 = 3

   2^1               11111110     254       127       2 - 1 = 1

   2^0               11111111     255*      N/A             N/A

Note: The 'Asterisk' represents Values that can not
      be used by the OCTET, which is define by the
      'Subnet Mask'.

Nevertheless, since there exist a Total Count of 256 Decimal
(Integers) representations expressing the total Number of available
IP Addresses. That is, since this is an inclusive count of the given
Range 0 - 255. Where by, equation 1, which enumerates this inclusive
count, establish the Total number of IP Addresses in the Range
'0 - 255'.

                1. [(255 - 0) + 1] = 256.

Moreover, this is also the Binary Representation, which equal of the
inclusive count for the total addresses in the 0 - 255 Range. It can
be concluded, that the Minuend 256, is some Multiple of the Number
of Total Number of Hosts Bits. That is, given that calculation of
this total, is also the inclusive count of the range comprising the
Octets. In which case, the Binary Number of Hosts Available would be
represented as 2^24, 2^16, and 2^8. Where by, these numbers represent
a count relative to the Total Number IP Bit Mapped Host Addresses.
However, if the case is such that, the total number of Host Bit
available were, '65,536', and the Least Significant Digit given as
'128'. Then, the Total of IP Host Bit Addresses available would be
given by the equation 2.

                2.   [65,536 / 128 = 512]

Furthermore, if the concept of Supernetting, was the Subnetting of
the only Host Octet available in the Class C. Then, the total of IP
Host Bit Addresses available, given a Least Significant Digit of 128,
is equal to the equation 3.

                3.  [256 / 128 = 2]

Nevertheless, the procedures involving Supernetting, as outlined in
the Classless System, did not eliminate the Structure or concepts of
the Class System. Especially since, it did not render any provisions
to Subnet the only Host Octet available in the Class C. Needless to
say, these conclusion clearly justifiable. Nonetheless, the change
to the IP Address Skeleton of each Class as summarized in Table 8,
and represents the structure of Class A.

Notwithstanding, the Definitions and Laws defining the Internet
Protocol Specifications for IPv7 and IPv8, which regarding their
implementation, would change the concepts of Subnetting and
Supernetting. That is to say, the definition of the Subnet
Identifier imposes restrictions upon the availability of the Octets,
which can be Subnetted or Supernetted. Given that, only the Host
Octets are available, and those that can be Subnetted, are the last
two within the IP Address. While Supernetting, is now defined as
the process of Subentting the last Octet of an IP Address. In other
words, the definitions and laws of IPv7 and IPv8 describe an outline
for Supernetting and Subnetting, which can not violate the
restrictions imposed.

However, these changes do not usher any significant change, which
would be a major departure from the foundational concepts of IPv4.
In other words, except for the laws, definitions, and the resulting
constraints imposed, the information provided herein, is the same
as that which governed IPv4. Nevertheless, the Tables below
summarize the logical format, which outlines the results of the
concepts of Subnetting and Supernetting in IPv7 and IPv8.

Note: The "+" after the Available Hosts Column reveals the number of
      Hosts remaining. However, this count can be adjusted, because
      its actual purpose is the determination of the number Hosts in
      relation to the number of BITS in the Subnet Mask for the
      Supernet. This situation becomes even more pronounced when the
      values assigned to the Last Octet of the Host must exclude,
      '111', '000', '255', and the number of the Supernet Mask
      (Which would also be a number included in the Network IP
      Address as well. For example; "255.255.255.Supernet Number".)

Chapter V Conclusion: The Benefits of IPv7 and IPv8

The benefits from the implementation of IPV7 could be a reality now.
This is because there are absolutely no changes in its Header, or
any of the other specifications outlined in other RFC's pertaining
to datagrams or its relation to other protocols. However, the
addition of a more stringent adherence to the rules of Logic will,
to most, seem beneficial. While, the growth in the number of
available IP Addresses that are available for assignment and
distribution, will usher a more stable growth of the Global
Telecommunications Community. Moreover, while mistakes are
unavoidable, they will not be an inherent part of the structure
of this Addressing System.

Furthermore, the benefits from the implementation of IPv8 will
seem to overshadow the number of available IP Addresses it provides.
That is, its implementation will foster the reality of dreams that
were once thought the fantasy found in the pages of a Science
fiction novel. This includes the simple problems as those
experienced by the Telephone Companies, and the shortages in the
supply of telephone numbers. Where by, the adoption of this system
would change the count in the number of digits from the present 11,
to a maximum of 15. Nonetheless, while this eliminates problems
associated with growth and the constantly changing prefix. Its
adoption could also change every concept in the Structure, Use,
and Underlining Foundations of the Entire Telecommunication Industry.

I mean, just think for a moment. Where, something as simple as the
'Junction Box', that now serves as the connecting and distribution
point, for homes, business, and apartment complexes. It could quite
conceivably, be replaced by a Network Server and a Router, which
would lessen the burden associated with the cost of the present
arrangement. In short, the existing Private Telephone System would
be replaced with a Private Computerized Telecommunication System,
and the Public Telephone System would become the Computerized
Information Telecommunication Systems. These new systems could
service the population of the entire World with any information
available from some assigned Resource Distribution Center.

While at the same time, IPv8 continues to open many other avenues
of exploitation for the Industries of the Entire World. For example,
the Television Industry, Cable Television Industry, the Video
Telephoning and Video Teleconferencing Industry, are only a few
of the many corporations that could benefit from its implementation.
However, while this says nothing about the changes and benefits that
its implementation offers the producer's of Networking equipment, or
any of its associated Hardware and Software. It does nonetheless,
bespeaks clearly about the promises and benefits of IPv8,
which are indeed an endless reality bound only by the limits of
our imagination.

Appendix II : The Mathematical Anomaly Explained

Nonetheless, this mathematical issue is an argument concerning,
whether or not there exist a 'One-to-One' Correspondence between the
Mathematical Calculations involving the Decimals (represented as
Intehers) and those concerning the Binary Operators (Logical
Expressions; the Truth Table values of 1's and 0's). Needless to say,
this Mathematical Anomaly becomes even more apparent when one observes
the Class B situation. Where by:

1. Class B; 128 -191, IP Address Range
   Default Subnet Mask; 255.255.000.000
   (Which yields: 2^14 Networks and 2^16 Hosts;
   that is, 16,384 Networks and 65,536 Hosts.)

However, this total is not the correct method of enumeration,
and it is not the actual number (Integer Number) of available
networks. And this FACT becomes even more apparent when the
Binary Translation of the Decimal (Integers) Numbers is
completed. That is, the result would yield 64 Binary
Numerical Representations, ONE for each of the Decimal numbers
(Integers) that are available in the IP Address for the Class B.
Where Class B should maintain the representation
(Which provides the actual Integer enumeration for the
calculation of the total IP Addresses available.
In other words, their independent count, of their respective
totals for the Actual Number of Available IP Addresses in the
Class B should Equal 64.) given by:

2. Class B: 128 -191, (Which equal the total of 64
   possible IP Addresses for the given Address Range)
   Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.000.000
   9Which results in 64^2 Networks and 254^2 Hosts;
   that is, 4,096 Networks and 64,516 Hosts.)

Nevertheless, an enumeration or break down count
association, of each representation, that is, Binary and Decimal.
Would indeed, provide a greater support for the conclusion presented
thus far. Where by, given the Classes noted in 1 & 2 above. We have:

1a. (128 + 128 + 128 + 128 + ...+ 128) = 128 x 128 = 2^14
        1     2     3     4  ...  -  128 = Total Count

Which equal the Total number of Networks for the Given Address
Range.

and

1b. (255 + 255 + 255 + 255 +...+ 255) = 255 x 255 = 2^16
        1     2     3     4 ...  - 255 = Total Count

Which equals the Total Number of Hosts for the Given Address
Range.

While noting that these equations represent the Binary Method
for determining the number of Networks and Hosts for the given
Address Range of Class B. However, keeping this in mind, notice
the difference that exist when this same calculation is used
for the Decimal (Integer) representation.

2a. (64 + 64 + 64 + 64 +...+ 64) = 64 x 64 = 64^2
       1    2    3    4  ... - 64 = Total Count


Where this number equals the number of Networks for the
Given Address Range assigned to Class B.

And

2b. (254 + 254 + 254 + 254 +...+ 254) = 254 x 254 = 254^2
        1     2     3     4 ...  -  254 = Total Count

Where this equation represent the Total Number of Hosts for
the Given Address Range of Class B.

In other words, given the equation (191 -128) + 1 = 64.
We are then presented with the Total Number of Addresses
available for the given Address Range, 128 - 191, for the
Class B. Where it can be seen that, any One-to-One mapping
of the Numbers in the Address Range and the Counting
Numbers (Integers), beginning with 1. Should yield the
Total Number of Addresses available in any Count, for
the Determination of the Total Number of Networks. And
this same line of reasoning applies to the Host count, as
well.

['Where the Subscript Number equals the Value of
 the Total Number of Availabe IP Addresses (a
 One-to-One  Correspondence between the Enumeration
 of, and the Address Ranges given) for the Network
 and Host Ranges in Class B. Where both Binary and
 Decimal Number representations are the given examples.']

Nevertheless, when the Decimal and Binary conversion
is completed. That is, when you establish a One-to-One
relationship between the Binary and Decimal Numbers.
You would discover that the their respective totals
would be the same. That is, there can only be 64 Binary
numbers and 64 Decimal numbers for the calculation
of the Total Number of Networks. And there can only be
254 Binary Numbers and 254 Decimal Numbers for the
calculation of the Total Number of Hosts. The difference is
that, the former method reveals the Binary calculation, while
the latter is the Integer (called the Decimal) Calculation.
Needless to say, it should be very clear that the Binary
method is a Logical Expression, and does see the Integer Count,
that is the 'Difference between the Range Boundaries Plus 1'.
Which yields the total number of available IP Addresses to be
used to determine the actual number of Hosts within a given IP
Address Class Range. Clearly, the Decimal method is indeed a
Mathematical Expression representing the operations involving the
Integers.

Needless to say, if you are confused or are in doubt of these
conclusions. Then my suggestion, would be to present my findings
to a Professor of Mathematics at some well established university.
