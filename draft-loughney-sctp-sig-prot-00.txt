Abstract 
    
    
   The Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) has been standardized to 
   provide a reliable transport services for signaling protocols.  SCTP 
   features a number of new features that are useful for transporting 
   signaling protocols, but may require additional information on how to 
   use them to transport existing signaling protocols.

         SCTP Layer for Transporting Signaling Protocols    June 2002 
 
 
    
1. Introduction 
    
   SCTP has been proposed as a reliable transport for signaling 
   protocols.  SCTP has a number of features that are desirable for 
   transporting signaling protocols.  This document proposes how these 
   features can be used by protocols. Additionally, an example is 
   provided of how an existing protocol can directly use SCTP. 
    
1.1 Motivation 
       
   Current work in the SIGTRAN Working Group [2719] defines architecture 
   for backhauling SS7 Signalling Protocols over IP.  However, no 
   consideration is given for signaling that is completely terminated in 
   IP networks (sometimes called 'all-IP' or 'full-IP' signaling).  
    
   There is a desire to use SCTP directly for signaling in many 
   networks.  However, as SCTP brings new features, many of which may 
   not be able to be directly supported by existing signaling 
   application protocols.   
    
   On the other hand, currently proposed layer structure for mobile 
   telephone networks, for example, consists on too many layers (based 
   on SS7 protocol stack). As the number of layers increases, the 
   complexity increases and the performance is decreased. 
    
   Therefore, there is a need to optimize the current control plane 
   protocol stacks (SCCP based). An alternative is the usage of very 
   light adaptation layer on top of SCTP that provides the same services 
   than the based on SS7 protocol stack. 
    
   The goal of this document is to discuss issues affecting this and to 
   propose a thin layer, as an extended API to SCTP, to allow transport 
   of existing protocols. 
     
1.2 Architectural view of SCTP Handler 
    
   The SCTP Handler is seen as an extension to the current SCTP API.  
   The socket API is considered in this document, but the proposals are 
   more general and are applicable to other APIs for SCTP. 
    
   The SCTP Handler allows a much lighter protocol stack, optimized for 
   the transport of typical application part protocols (ex: RANAP, 
   RNSAP, BSSAP) over IP. Optimization is possible by removing the not 
   needed and the redundant functionality provided by the signaling 
   protocol stacks. 
    
1.3 Functional view of SCTP Handler

1.4 Definitions 
    
   SCTP association: A protocol relationship between SCTP endpoints, 
   composed of the two SCTP endpoints and protocol state information 
   including Verification Tags and the currently active set of 
   Transmission Sequence Numbers (TSNs), etc. An association can be 
   uniquely identified by the transport addresses used by the endpoints 
   in the association. Two SCTP endpoints MUST NOT have more than one 
   SCTP association between them at any given time.  
    
   SCTP endpoint: The logical sender/receiver of SCTP packets. On a 
   multi-homed host, an SCTP endpoint is represented to its peers as a 
   combination of a set of eligible destination transport addresses to 
   which SCTP packets can be sent and a set of eligible source transport 
   addresses from which SCTP packets can be received. All transport 
   addresses used by an SCTP endpoint must use the same port number, but 
   can use multiple IP addresses. A transport address used by an SCTP 
   endpoint must not be used by another SCTP endpoint. In other words, a 
   transport address is unique to an SCTP endpoint. 
    
   SCTP Stream: An unidirectional logical channel established from one 
   to another associated SCTP endpoint, within which all user messages 
   are delivered in sequence except for those submitted to the unordered 
   delivery service.  
    
   Multi-streaming: SCTP feature that allows data to be partitioned into 
   multiple streams that have the property of being delivered 
   independently, so that message loss in any of the streams will only 
   affect delivery within that stream, and not in other streams.

3. Services Provided by SCTP Handler 
    
   The following is a list of functions that the SCTP is assumed to 
   provide: 
    
     * SCTP Association Usage 
     * Stream ID management & Usage 
     * Upper Layer Protocol Identifier Management 
     * Client-Server Considerations 
     * Support for connection-oriented and connection-less signaling 
    
4. Features of SCTP Handler 
    
4.1 Usage of SCTP Associations 
    
   Matching of SCTP associations / SCTP endpoints to signaling 
   application endpoints is somewhat of an issue.  This is related to 
   how entities are addressed in an SS7 environment.  The SCTP handler 
   should take this into consideration. 
    
4.2 Usage of SCTP Streams 
    
   Existing applications may not be able to use SCTP streams [add 
   reference]. 
    
   SCTP streams are uni-directional, however many application protocols 
   may assume a bi-directional flow of traffic.   
    
   The SCTP handler should manage the SCTP streams for the user (the 
   upper layer signaling protocol). 
    
4.3 Data Transfer 
 
   TBD 
    
4.4 Identifiers 
    
   SS7 protocols have a different addressing model than IP.  Some layers 
   are hop-by-hop and do not assume global addressing.  It may be 
   reasonable to assume that SS7 addressing will not disappear; however 
   overlaying non-global addressing on top of IP is not a reasonable 
   long-term assumption. In practice, it may be useful to consider SS7 
   addresses as labels, rather than point codes when signaling in an IP 
   network.

4.5 Client-Server Behavior  
    
   Many signaling protocols are client-server in nature; while SCTP is 
   peer-to-peer.  SCTP handler should provide any specific client-server 
   behavior. 
    
5. Security Considerations 
 
   Traditionally telephony networks have been considered closed and/or 
   trusted networks.  By integrating them into the Internet, there are 
   security concerns.  It is assumed that the signaling protocols will 
   need encryption.  Currently, the recommended ways are using TLS with 
   SCTP or IPsec and SCTP.   
    
   SCTP and IKE are seen as a good solution for creating virtual private 
   networks (VPNs) on an intra-domain signaling case.  However, for 
   interdomain signaling, there is an issue with use of IKE without a 
   global PKI.  TLS handles cert exchanges quite well and may be 
   preferable than IPsec in this circumstance. 
     
6. IANA Considerations 
 
   It may be necessary to apply for an SCTP Payload identifier.
