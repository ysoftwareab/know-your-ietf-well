Abstract

   This document specifies how the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)
   can be instantiated as a data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP
   offer/answer exchange-based external negotiation defined in [I-
   D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]. Two network configurations are
   documented: a WebRTC end-to-end configuration (connecting two BFCP
   over data channel endpoints), and a gateway configuration
   (connecting an BFCP over data channel endpoint with an BFCP over
   (TLS)/TCP/IP (or over (DTLS)/UDP/IP) endpoint).

1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation

   The Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) is basically used between
   floor participants and floor control servers, and between floor
   chairs (i.e., moderators) and floor control servers [RFC4582]. BFCP
   messages are transported either

   a) preferably in a reliable manner, using either unsecured TCP
   connections or TLS-secured TCP connections; or

   b) alternatively using the unreliable UDP, either unsecured or DTLS-
   secured DTLS connections. The UDP option is motivated by potential
   NAT traversal issues.

   Clause 6 in [RFC4582bis] describes all that legacy BFCP transport
   options for native BFCP endpoints (i.e., not using WebRTC).

Internet-Draft         BFCP over Data Channels               April 2016


   The indication and negotiation of such BFCP transports at call
   control signalling level is based on SDP offer/answer procedures and
   defined by [RFC4583] and [RFC4583bis].

   WebRTC introduces another protocol stack for transporting BFCP,
   i.e., there are impacts and modifications related to the SDP
   offer/answer. Purpose of this RFC is to define the WebRTC-specific
   SDP signalling for BFCP-based floor control in WebRTC.

1.2. Framework of WebRTC data applications

   There are multiple IP application protocols which using WebRTC data
   channels as transport, such as MSRP or T.140 besides BFCP. The SDP-
   based indication and negotiation of such WebRTC data applications at
   call control signalling level follows common principles. The first
   WebRTC application from this suite is/was the MSRP-based instant
   messaging service for WebRTC, see [I-D.ietf-mmusic-msrp-usage-data-
   channel]. This specification for BFCP was derived from that document
   and uses an aligned clause structuring.

   It may be noted that the BFCP protocol as such is simpler in
   comparison to the MSRP, which requires an extended set of SDP
   elements (in comparison to BFCP) for the description of specific
   MSRP services and their protocol parameter settings. The NAT
   traversal situation at IP application protocol layer ("Layer(s) 4+")
   is also simpler for BFCP than for MSRP because BFCP does not carry
   network and/or transport address information in the BFCP message.

Internet-Draft         BFCP over Data Channels               April 2016


3.1.1. Terminology specific for WebRTC data channel control

   Data channel: A WebRTC data channel as specified in [I-D.ietf-
   rtcweb-data-channel].

   BFCP data channel: A data channel specifically used to transport the
   text and presentation control information of one BFCP session.

     NOTE - The notion of "BFCP session" relates not necessarily to a
     single "SIP session", i.e., a single WebRTC call, see clause 4.2.

   External negotiation: Data channel negotiation based on out-of-band
   or in-band mechanisms other than the Data Channel Establishment
   Protocol specified in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol].

   In-band: Transmission through the peer-to-peer SCTP association.

   Out-of-band: Transmission through the call control signaling path,
   e.g., using JSEP [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep] and the SDP Offer/Answer
   model [RFC3264].

   Peer: From the perspective of one of the agents in a session, its
   peer is the other agent. Specifically, from the perspective of the
   SDP offerer, the peer is the SDP answerer. From the perspective of
   the SDP answerer, the peer is the SDP offerer

3.1.2. Terminology specific to the IP application protocol 'BFCP'

   Client: see clause 2/[RFC4582].

   Floor: A temporary permission to access or manipulate a specific
   shared resource or set of resources (see clause 2/[RFC4582]).

   Floor Chair: see clause 2/[RFC4582].

   Floor Control: see clause 2/[RFC4582].

   Floor Control Server: see clause 2/[RFC4582].

   Floor Participant: see clause 2/[RFC4582].

   Media Participant: see clause 2/[RFC4582].

   Participant: see clause 2/[RFC4582].

4. Prinicples

4.1. BFCP Data Channel

   In this document, an BFCP data channel is a data channel for which
   the instantiated sub-protocol is "BFCP", and where the BFCP-related
   negotiation is done as part of the SDP-based external negotiation
   method defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

Internet-Draft         BFCP over Data Channels               April 2016


4.2. Session Mapping

   In this design, the BFCP "session" maps to the SCTP association and
   the "SCTP stream pair" assigned to the data channel, and each BFCP
   "session" maps to one data channel exactly.

4.3. BFCP endpoint

   A BFCP endpoint represents in the domain of the

   o  conferencing service: a "floor participant", a "floor chair" or a
      "floor control server" (see clause 3 in [RFC4582]);

   o  signalling plane: a "client only", a "server only" or "client and
      server" role behaviour (see clause 4 in [RFC4583]).

   The signalling role characteristic is of primary interest in this
   RFC due to its scope on WebRTC client-embedded BFCP endpoints.

4.4. Association between conference media streams and their conference
   floor

4.4.1. Background (non-WebRTC conferences)

   A particular conference might be constituted by a single or multiple
   media streams. And their might be a single or multiple (static or
   temporary) floors per conference enabled. There are consequently one
   or more media streams "under the auspices of" a specific floor. That
   relationship is signalled via the SDP 'floorid' attribute (see
   clause 6 in [RFC4583]), which links a set of media streams to a
   specific floor.

4.4.2. Association in WebRTC conferences

   A conference media stream might be principally WebRTC audio, video
   and data streams (to be confirmed).

   The media stream parameter 'mstrm' in the SDP 'floorid' attribute
   needs consequently to be linked to a particular WebRTC media
   component. The binding is basically achieved by labelling a SDP
   media description (i.e., a WebRTC media component behind a SDP "m="-
   line section) using the [RFC4574] SDP "a=label:" attribute.

   Editor's note 1: above assumption needs to be confirmed

   Editor's note 2: a SDP example might be beneficial ...

5. End-to-End Configuration

   This section describes the network configuration where each BFCP
   endpoint is running BFCP over a data channel.

5.1. Basic BFCP Support

5.1.1. Session Negotiation

5.1.1.1. Use of dcmap Attribute

   The SDP offer shall include a dcmap attribute line (defined in [I-
   D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg], within the media description for
   the SCTP association for each BFCP data channel session to be
   negotiated.

   The attribute includes the following data channel parameters:

   o  "label=" labelstring

   o  "subprotocol=" "BFCP"

   The labelstring is set by the BFCP application according to [I-
   D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]. The max-retr, max-time and
   ordered parameters shall not be used.

   Rest of the SDP offer/answer procedures are per [I-D.ietf-mmusic-
   data-channel-sdpneg].

   The following is an example of the dcmap attribute for an BFCP
   session to be negotiated (on default SCTP port 5000) with stream=4
   and without any label:

   a=dcmap:4 subprotocol="BFCP"



5.1.1.2. Use of dcsa Attribute

   The SDP offer SHALL also include a dcsa attribute line (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]) within the media description
   for the SCTP association for each BFCP-specific SDP attribute to be
   negotiated for each BFCP data channel being negotiated.

   The BFCP-specific items that can be negotiated include at least
   following well-known attributes:

Internet-Draft         BFCP over Data Channels               April 2016


   o  defined in [RFC4583]: "floorctrl", "confid", "userid", "floorid";

   o  defined in [RFC4583bis]: "bfcpver"; and

   o  defined in [RFC4574]: "label".

   FIXTHIS ("any SDP attribute specific normative semantics? see MSRP
   ...")

   The SDP answer shall include zero or more corresponding dcsa
   attribute lines for each negotiated BFCP session, according to the
   BFCP-specific attribute negotiation rules in the corresponding
   specifications.

   A new SDP offer/answer may update the BFCP subprotocol attribute(s)
   while keeping the same subprotocol a=dcmap description.

5.1.1.3. Example SDP Negotiation

   The following is an example of an "m"-line for data channels in an
   SDP offer that includes the attributes needed to establish a BFCP
   session:

         m=application 21212 <L4>/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel
         c=IN IP4 11.9.19.65
         a=max-message-size:1000       ; NOTE 1
         a=sctp-port 5000
         a=dcmap:1 label="floor control";subprotocol="BFCP"
         a=dcsa:1 floorctrl:s-only ; "floor control server only"
         a=dcsa:1 confid:4321          ; NOTE 2
         a=dcsa:1 userid:1234          ; NOTE 3
         a=dcsa:1 floorid: 1 mstrm:3 7 ; NOTE 4

     NOTE 1 - Much smaller than e.g. MSRP. The purpose of "binary
     encoding" use in BFCP is to minimize BFCP message sizes!

     NOTE 2 - Conference identifier of the WebRTC embedded conferencing
     service.

     NOTE 3 - User identifier. There is a 1:1 relationship between a
     WebRTC client and an embedded BFCP user. (to be confirmed)

     NOTE 4 - Two WebRTC media components (labelled with identifiers
     '3' and '7') are subject of floor control. (to be confirmed)

   Editor's note 1: above assumption needs to be confirmed

   Editor's note 2: the example should be expanded in order to
   illustrate the location of the two labels "a=label:3" and
   "a=label:7" within the entire SDP offer.
