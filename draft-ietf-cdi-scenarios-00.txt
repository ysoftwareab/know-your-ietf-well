   use in the "real world", it's useful to provide examples of the
   possible sequence of events that may occur when two content networks
   decide to interconnect. The scenarios presented here seek to provide
   some concrete examples of what content internetworking is, and also
   to provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking proposals.

1. Introduction

   In [1], the concept of a "content network" is introduced and
   described. In addition to describing some general types of content
   networks, it also describes motivations for allowing content
   networks to interconnect (defined as ôcontent internetworkingö).

   In describing content internetworking as a technology targeted for
   use in the "real world", it's useful to provide examples of the
   possible sequence of events that may occur when two content networks
   decide to interconnect. Naturally, different types of content
   networks may be created due to different business motivations, and
   so many combinations are likely.

   This document first provides detailed examples of special cases of
   content networks that are specifically designed to participate in
   content internetworking (Section 2). We then discuss the steps that
   would be taken in order to "bring up" or "tear down" a content
   internetworking arrangement (Section 3). Next we provide some
   detailed examples of how content networks (such as those from
   Section 2) could interconnect (Section 4). Finally, we describe any
   security considerations that arise specifically from the examples
   presented here (Section 5).

   The scenarios presented here answer two distinct needs:

   1.  To provide some concrete examples of what content
       internetworking is, and

   2.  To provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking
       proposals.

   For details on the architectural framework used in the development
   of actual content internetworking protocols and interfaces, refer to
   [2]. For specific examples of systems where content internetworking
   has been implemented, refer to [5].

1.1 Terminology

   Terms in ALL CAPS are defined in [1].

2. Special Cases of Content Networks

   A CN is defined in [2] as having REQUEST-ROUTING, DISTRIBUTION, and
   ACCOUNTING interfaces. However, some participating networks may
   gravitate toward particular subsets of the CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
   interfaces. Others may be seen differently in terms of how they
   relate to their CLIENT bases. This section describes these refined
   cases of the general CN case so they may be available for easier
   reference in the further development of CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
   scenarios. The special cases described are the Publishing Content

   Network, the Brokering Content Network, and the Local Request-
   Routing Content Network.

2.1 Publishing Content Network

   A Publishing Content Network (PCN), maintained by a PUBLISHER,
   contains an ORIGIN and has a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with two or
   more CNs. A PCN may contain SURROGATES for the benefit of serving
   some CONTENT REQUESTS locally, but does not intend to allow its
   SURROGATES to serve CONTENT on behalf of other PUBLISHERS.

   Several implications follow from knowing that a particular CN is a
   PCN. First, the PCN contains the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING
   SYSTEM for the PUBLISHER's CONTENT. This arrangement allows the
   PUBLISHER to determine the distribution of CONTENT REQUESTS among
   ENLISTED CNs. Second, it implies that the PCN need only participate
   in a subset of CONTENT INTERNETWORKING. For example, a PCN's
   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM need only be able to receive
   DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS, it need not send them. Similarly, a
   PCN's REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM has no reason to send
   AREA ADVERTISEMENTS. Finally, a PCN's ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING
   SYSTEM need only be able to receive ACCOUNTING data, it need not
   send it.

2.2 Brokering Content Network

   A Brokering Content Network (BCN) is a network that does not operate
   its own SURROGATES. Instead, a BCN operates only CIGs as a service
   on behalf other CNs. A BCN may therefore be regarded as a
   "clearinghouse" for CONTENT INTERNETWORKING information.

   For example, a BCN may choose to participate in DISTRIBUTION
   INTERNETWORKING and/or REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING in order to
   aggregate ADVERTISEMENTS from one set of CNs into a single update
   stream for the benefit of other CNs. To name a single specific
   example, a BCN could aggregate CONTENT SIGNALS from CNs that
   represent PUBLISHERS into a single update stream for the benefit of
   CNs that contain SURROGATES. A BCN may also choose to participate in
   ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING in order to aggregate utilization data
   from several CNs into combined reports for CNs that represent
   PUBLISHERS.

   This definition of a BCN implies that a BCN's CIGs would implement
   the sending and/or receiving of any combination of ADVERTISEMENTS
   and ACCOUNTING data as is necessary to provide desired services to
   other CONTENT NETWORKS. For example, a BCN only interested in
   aggregating ACCOUNTING data on behalf of other CNs would only need
   to have an ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING interface on its CIGs.

2.3 Local Request-Routing Content Network



Day et. al.            Expires August 22, 2002               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              CDI Scenarios              February, 2002

   Another type of CN is the Local Request-Routing CONTENT NETWORK
   (LCN). An LCN is defined as a type of network where CLIENTS' CONTENT
   REQUESTS are always handled by some local SERVER (such as a caching
   proxy [1]). In this context, "local" is taken to mean that both the
   CLIENT and SERVER are within the same administrative domain, and
   there is an administrative motivation for forcing the local mapping.
   This type of arrangement is common in enterprises where all CONTENT
   REQUESTS must be directed through a local SERVER for access control
   purposes.

   As implied by the name, the LCN creates an exception to the rule
   that there is a single AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM for a
   particular item of CONTENT. By directing CONTENT REQUESTS through
   the local SERVER, CONTENT RESPONSES may be given to CLIENTS without
   first referring to the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM. Knowing
   this to be true, other CNs may seek a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with
   an LCN in order to perform DISTRIBUTION into the LCN and receive
   ACCOUNTING data from it. Note that once it's participating in
   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING and ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING, the
   SERVERS within the LCN effectively take on the role of SURROGATES.
   However, an LCN would not intend to allow its SURROGATES to be
   accessed by non-local CLIENTS.

   This set of assumptions implies multiple things about the LCN's
   CONTENT INTERNETWORKING relationships. First, it is implied that the
   LCN's DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM need only be able to send
   DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS, it need not receive them. Second, it is
   implied that an LCN's ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM need only be
   able to send ACCOUNTING data, it need not receive it. Finally, due
   to the locally defined REQUEST-ROUTING, the LCN would not
   participate in REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING.

3. Content Internetworking Arrangements

   When the controlling interests of two CNs decide to interconnect
   their respective networks (such as for business reasons), it is
   expected that multiple steps would need to occur.

   The first step would be the creation of a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP.
   This relationship would most likely take the form of a legal
   document that describes the services to be provided, cost of
   services, SLAs, and other stipulations. For example, if an
   ORIGINATING CN wished to leverage another CN's reach into a
   particular country, this would be laid out in the NEGOTIATED
   RELATIONSHIP.

   The next step would be to configure CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
   protocols on the CIGs of the respective CNs in order to technically
   support the terms of the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP. To follow our
   previous example, this could include the configuration of the
   ENLISTED CN's CIGs in a particular country to send DISTRIBUTION
   ADVERTISEMENTS to the CIGs of the ORIGINATING CN. In order to

Day et. al.            Expires August 22, 2002               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              CDI Scenarios              February, 2002

   configure these protocols, technical details (such as CIG
   addresses/hostnames and authentication information) would be
   exchanged by administrators of the respective CNs.

   In the event that the controlling interests of two CNs no longer
   wish to have their networks interconnected, it is expected that
   these tasks would be undone in reverse order. That is, first the
   protocol configurations would be changed to cease the movement of
   ADVERTISEMENTS and/or ACCOUNTING data between the networks. After
   this, the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP would be legally terminated.

4. Content Internetworking Scenarios

   This section provides several scenarios that may arise in CONTENT
   INTERNETWORKING implementations.

   Note that we obviously cannot examine every single permutation.
   Specifically, it should be noted that:

   o  Any one of the interconnected CNs may have other CONTENT
      INTERNETWORKING arrangements that may or may not be transitive to
      the relationships being described in the diagram.

   o  The graphical figures do not illustrate the CONTENT REQUEST
      paths. It is assumed that the direction of CONTENT REQUESTS
      follow the methodology given in [2] and that the end result is
      that a REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM eventually returns to the CLIENT
      the IP address of the SURROGATE deemed appropriate to honor the
      CLIENT's CONTENT REQUEST.

   The scenarios described include a general case, two cases in which
   BCNs provide limited interfaces, a case in which a PCN enlists the
   services of multiple CNs, and a case in which multiple CNs enlist
   the services of an LCN.

4.1 General Content Internetworking

   This scenario considers the general case where two or more existing
   CNs wish to establish a CONTENT INTERNETWORKING relationship in
   order to provide increased scale and reach for their existing
   customers. It assumes that all of these CNs already provide REQUEST-
   ROUTING, DISTRIBUTION, and ACCOUNTING services and that they will
   continue to provide these services to existing customers as well as
   offering them to other CNs.

   In this scenario, these CIs would interconnect with others via a CIG
   which provides a REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM, a
   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM, and an ACCOUNTING
   INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM. The net result of this interconnection would
   be that a larger set of SURROGATES will now be available to the
   CLIENTS.

   FIGURE 1 shows three CNs which have interconnected to provide
   greater scale and reach to their existing customers. They are all
   participating in DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING, REQUEST-ROUTING
   INTERNETWORKING, and ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING.

   As a result of the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS it is assumed that:

   1.  CONTENT that has been INJECTED into any one of these ORIGINATING
       CNs may be distributed into any other ENLISTED CN.

   2.  Commands affecting the DISTRIBUTION of CONTENT may be issued
       within the ORIGINATING CN, or may also be issued within the
       ENLISTED CN.

   3.  ACCOUNTING information regarding CLIENT access and/or
       DISTRIBUTION actions will be made available to the ORIGINATING
       CN by the ENLISTED CN.

   4.  The ORIGINATING CN would provide this ACCOUNTING information to
       the PUBLISHER based on existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   5.  CONTENT REQUESTS by CLIENTS may be directed to SURROGATES within
       any of the ENLISTED CNs.

   The decision of where to direct an individual CONTENT REQUEST may be
   dependent upon the DISTRIBUTION and REQUEST-ROUTING policies
   associated with the CONTENT being requested as well as the specific
   algorithms and methods used for directing these requests. For
   example, a REQUEST-ROUTING policy for a piece of CONTENT may
   indicate multiple versions exist based on the spoken language of a
   CLIENT. Therefore, the REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM of an ENLISTED CN
   would likely direct a CONTENT REQUEST to a SURROGATE known to be
   holding a version of CONTENT of a language that matches that of a
   CLIENT.

4.2 BCN providing ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING and REQUEST-ROUTING
INTERNETWORKING

   This scenario describes the case where a single entity (BCN A)
   performs ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING and REQUEST-ROUTING
   INTERNETWORKING functions, but has no inherent DISTRIBUTION or
   DELIVERY capabilities. A potential configuration which illustrates
   this concept is given in FIGURE 2.

   In the scenario shown in FIGURE 2, BCN A is responsible for
   collecting ACCOUNTING information from multiple CONTENT NETWORKS (CN
   A and CN B) to provide a clearinghouse/settlement function, as well
   as providing a REQUEST-ROUTING service for CN A and CN B.

   In this scenario, CONTENT is injected into either CN A or CN B and
   its DISTRIBUTION between these CNs is controlled via the
   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEMS within the CIGs. The REQUEST-
   ROUTING SYSTEM provided by BCN A is informed of the ability to serve
   a piece of CONTENT from a particular CONTENT NETWORK by the REQUEST-
   ROUTING SYSTEMS within the interconnected CIGs.

   BCN A collects statistics and usage information via the ACCOUNTING
   INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM and disseminates that information to CN A and
   CN B as appropriate.

   As illustrated in FIGURE 2, there are separate REQUEST-ROUTING
   SYSTEMS employed within CN A and CN B. If the REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM
   provided by BCN A is the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM for a
   given piece of CONTENT this is not a problem. However, each
   individual CN may also provide the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING
   SYSTEM for some portion of its PUBLISHER customers. In this case
   care must be taken to ensure that the there is one and only one
   AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM identified for each given
   CONTENT object.

4.3 BCN providing ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING

   This scenario describes the case where a single entity (BCN A)
   performs ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING to provide a clearinghouse/
   settlement function only. In this scenario, BCN A would enter into
   NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS with multiple CNs that each perform their
   own DISTRIBUTION INTERNETOWRKING and REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING
   as shown in FIGURE 3.

Internet-Draft              CDI Scenarios              February, 2002


4.4 PCN ENLISTS multiple CNs

   In the previously enumerated scenarios, PUBLISHERS have not been
   discussed. Much of the time, it is assumed that the PUBLISHERS will
   allow CNs to act on their behalf. For example, a PUBLISHER may
   designate a particular CN to be the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING
   SYSTEM for its CONTENT. Similarly, a PUBLISHER may rely on a
   particular CN to aggregate all its ACCOUNTING data, even though that
   data may originate at SURROGATES in multiple distant CNs. Finally, a
   PUBLISHER may INJECT content only into a single CN and rely on that
   CN to ENLIST other CNs to obtain scale and reach.

   However, a PUBLISHER may wish to maintain more control and take on
   the task of ENLISTING CNs itself, therefore acting as a PCN (Section
   2.1). This scenario, shown in FIGURE 4, describes the case where a
   PCN wishes to directly enter into NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS with
   multiple CNs. In this scenario, the PCN would operate its own CIG
   and enter into DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING, ACCOUNTING
   INTERNETWORKING, and REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING relationships
   with two or more CNs.

4.5 Multiple CNs ENLIST LCN

   A type of CN described in Section 2.3 is the LCN. In this scenario,
   we imagine a tightly administered CN (such as within an enterprise)
   has determined that all CONTENT REQUESTS from CLIENTS must be
   serviced locally. Likely due to a large CLIENT base in the LCN,
   multiple CNs determine they would like to engage in DISTRIBUTION
   INTERNETWORKING with the LCN in order to extend control over CONTENT
   objects held in the LCN's SURROGATES. Similarly, the CNs would like
   to engage in ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING with the LCN in order to
   receive ACCOUTING data regarding the usage of the content in the
   local SURROGATES. This scenario is shown in FIGURE 5.

5. Security Considerations

   This section contains security considerations that arise
   specifically from the examples presented here. For a more general
   discussion of security in the CDI protocols, see [2].

   Due to the likely reliance on ACCOUNTING data as the basis of
   payment for services, the likelihood of fraud may be a concern of
   parties that participate in CONTENT INTERNETWORKING. Indeed, it's
   easy to imagine fabricating log entries or increasing throughput
   numbers to increase revenue. While this is a difficult problem to
   solve, there are some approaches to be explored. A useful tool would
   be a "fraud detection" analysis tool that is capable of modeling
   human usage patterns and detecting anomalies. It may be logical for
   such a tool to be run by a BCN that is acting as an "impartial third
   party", ENLISTED only to ensure fairness among participants.
   Additionally, a BCN may be ENLISTED to perform random audits of
   ACCOUNTING data.
