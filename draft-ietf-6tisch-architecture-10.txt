1.  Introduction

   Wireless Networks enable a wide variety of devices of any size to get
   interconnected, often at a very low marginal cost per device, at any
   distance ranging from Near Field to interplanetary, and in
   circumstances where wiring may be impractical, for instance on fast-
   moving or rotating devices.

   In the other hand, Deterministic Networks enable traffic that is
   highly sensitive to jitter, quite sensitive to latency, and with a
   high degree of operational criticality so that loss should be
   minimized at all times.  Applications that need such networks are
   presented in [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases].  They include Professional
   Media and Operation Technology (OT) Industrial Automation Control
   Systems (IACS).

   The Medium access Control (MAC) of IEEE802.15.4 [IEEE802154] has
   evolved with the IEEE802.15.4e Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH)
   [RFC7554] mode to provide deterministic properties on wireless
   networks.  TSCH was initially introduced with the IEEE802.15.4e
   amendment [IEEE802154e] of the IEEE802.15.4 standard and constituted
   a part of the standard from that day.  For all practical purpose,
   this document is expected to be insensitive to the revisions of the
   IEEE802.15.4 standard, which is thus referenced undated.

   Proven Deterministic Networking standards for use in Process Control,
   including ISA100.11a [ISA100.11a] and WirelessHART [WirelessHART],
   have demonstrated the capabilities of the IEEE802.15.4 TSCH MAC for
   high reliability against interference, low-power consumption on well-
   known flows, and its applicability for Traffic Engineering (TE) from
   a central controller.

   In order to enable the convergence of IT and OT in LLN environments,
   6TiSCH ports the IETF suite of protocol that are defined for such
   environments over the TSCH MAC. 6TiSCH also provides large scaling
   capabilities, which, in a number of scenarios, require the addition
   of a high speed and reliable backbone and the use of IP version 6
   (IPv6).  The 6TiSCH Architecture introduces an IPv6 Multi-Link subnet
   model that is composed of a federating backbone and a number of
   IEEE802.15.4 TSCH low-power wireless networks attached and
   synchronized by Backbone Routers.

   The architecture defines mechanisms to establish and maintain routing
   and scheduling in a centralized, distributed, or mixed fashion, for
   use in multiple OT environments.  It is applicable in particular to
   industrial control systems, building automation that leverage

   distributed routing to address multipath over a large number of hops,
   in-vehicle command and control that can be as demanding as industrial
   applications, commercial automation and asset Tracking with mobile
   scenarios, home automation and domotics which become more reliable
   and thus provide a better user experience, and resource management
   (energy, water, etc.).

2.  Terminology

   The draft uses domain-specific terminology defined or referenced in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology], [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router], and
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6"
   [RFC4861], "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
   (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals"
   [RFC4919], and Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-power and
   Lossy Networks [RFC6775] where the 6LoWPAN Router (6LR) and the
   6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) are introduced.

   Readers may benefit from reading the "RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for
   Low-Power and Lossy Networks" [RFC6550] specification; "Multi-Link
   Subnet Issues" [RFC4903]; "Mobility Support in IPv6" [RFC6275];
   "Neighbor Discovery Proxies (ND Proxy)" [RFC4389]; "IPv6 Stateless
   Address Autoconfiguration" [RFC4862]; "FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-
   Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned
   IPv6 Addresses" [RFC6620]; and "Optimistic Duplicate Address
   Detection" [RFC4429] prior to this specification for a clear
   understanding of the art in ND-proxying and binding.

   The draft also conforms to the terms and models described in
   [RFC3444] and [RFC5889] and uses the vocabulary and the concepts
   defined in [RFC4291] for the IPv6 Architecture and refers [RFC4080]
   for reservation signaling and [RFC5191] for authentication.

3.  High Level Architecture

3.1.  6TiSCH Stack

   The 6TiSCH architecture presents a reference stack that is
   implemented and interop tested by a conjunction of opensource, IETF
   and ETSI efforts.  One goal is to help other bodies to adopt the
   stack as a whole, making the effort to move to an IPv6-based IOT
   stack easier.  Now, for a particular, environment, some of the
   choices that are made in this architecture may not be relevant.  For
   instance, RPL is not required for star topologies and mesh-under
   layer-2 routed networks, and the 6LoWPAN compression may not be

   sufficient for ultra-constrained cases such as some Low Power Wide
   Area (LPWA) networks.  In such cases, it is perfectly doable to adopt
   a subset of the selection that is presented hereafter and then select
   alternate components to complete the solution wherever needed.

   The IETF proposes multiple techniques for implementing functions
   related to routing, transport or security.  In order to control the
   complexity of the possible deployments and device interactions, and
   to limit the size of the resulting object code, the architecture
   limits the possible variations of the stack and recommends a number
   of base elements for LLN applications.  In particular, UDP [RFC0768]
   [RFC2460] and the Constrained Application Protocol [RFC7252] (CoAP)
   are used as the transport / binding of choice for applications and
   management as opposed to TCP and HTTP.

   The resulting stack is represented below:


      +-----+-----+-----+------+-------+-----+
      |     (COMI)      |(PANA)|6LoWPAN| RPL |
      | CoAP  / DTLS    |      |   ND  |     |
      +-----+-----+-----+------+-------+-----+
      |       UDP       |          ICMP      |
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+------+-----+
      |                 IPv6                      |
      +-------------------------------------------+
      |  6LoWPAN adaptation and compression (HC)  |
      +-------------------------------------------+
      |                   6top                    |
      +-------------------------------------------+
      |             IEEE802.15.4    TSCH          |
      +-------------------------------------------+

                      Figure 1: 6TiSCH Protocol Stack

   RPL is the routing protocol of choice for LLNs.  So far, there was no
   identified need to define a 6TiSCH specific Objective Function.  The
   Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal] describes the
   operation of RPL over a static schedule used in a slotted aloha
   fashion, whereby all active slots may be used for emission or
   reception of both unicast and multicast frames.

   The 6LoWPAN Header Compression [RFC6282] is used to compress the IPv6
   and UDP headers, whereas the 6LoWPAN Routing Header
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-dispatch] is used to compress the RPL
   artifacts in the IPv6 data packets, including the RPL Packet
   Information (RPI), the IP-in-IP encapsulation to/from the RPL root,
   and the Source Route Header (SRH) in non-storing mode.

   6TiSCH has adopted the general direction of CoAP Management Interface
   (COMI) [I-D.vanderstok-core-comi] for the management of devices.
   This is leveraged for instance for the implementation of the generic
   data model for the 6top sublayer management interface
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-interface].  The proposed implementation is
   based on CoAP and CBOR, and specified in 6TiSCH Resource Management
   and Interaction using CoAP [I-D.ietf-6tisch-coap].

   The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] is represented
   as an example of a protocol that could be used to protect CoAP
   datagrams, but the exact stack is not determined at the time of this
   writing..

   Similarly, the Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network
   access (PANA) [RFC5191] is represented as an example of a protocol
   that could be leveraged to secure the join process, as a Layer-3
   alternate to IEEE802.1x/EAP.  Regardless, the security model ensures
   that, prior to a join process, packets from a untrusted device are
   controlled in volume and in reachability.  In particular, a PANA
   stack should be separated from the main protocol stack to avoid
   attacks during the join process that is introduced in Section 3.7.
   An overview of the security aspects of the join process can be found
   in Section 6.

   The 6TiSCH Operation sublayer (6top) [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer]
   is a sublayer of a Logical Link Control (LLC) that provides the
   abstraction of an IP link over a TSCH MAC and schedules packets over
   TSCH cells,as further discussed in the next sections.

3.2.  TSCH: A Deterministic MAC Layer

   Though at a different time scale (several orders of magnitude), both
   IEEE802.1TSN and IEEE802.15.4TSCH standards provide Deterministic
   capabilities to the point that a packet that pertains to a certain
   flow may traverse a network from node to node following a very
   precise schedule, as a train that enters and then leaves intermediate
   stations at precise times along its path.  With TSCH, time is
   formatted into timeslots, and individual communication cells are
   allocated to unicast or broadcast communication at the MAC level.
   The time-slotted operation reduces collisions, saves energy, and
   enables to more closely engineer the network for deterministic
   properties.  The channel hopping aspect is a simple and efficient
   technique to combat multipath fading and external interference (for
   example by Wi-Fi emitters).

   6TiSCH builds on the IEEE802.15.4TSCH MAC and inherits its advanced
   capabilities to enable them in multiple environments where they can
   be leveraged to improve automated operations.  The 6TiSCH

   Architecture also inherits the capability to perform a centralized
   route computation to achieve deterministic properties, though it
   relies on the IETF DetNet Architecture
   [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture], and IETF components such as the Path
   Computation Element (PCE) [PCE], for the protocol aspects.

   On top of this inheritance, 6TiSCH adds capabilities for distributed
   routing and scheduling operations based on the RPL routing protocol
   and capabilities to negotiate schedule adjustments between peers.
   These distributed routing and scheduling operations simplify the
   deployment of TSCH networks and enable wireless solutions in a larger
   variety of use cases from operational technology in general.
   Examples of such use-cases in industrial environments include plant
   setup and decommissioning, as well as monitoring of lots of lesser
   importance measurements such as corrosion and events.  RPL also
   enables mobile use cases such as mobile workers and cranes, as
   presented in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability].

3.3.  Scheduling TSCH

   A scheduling operation attributes cells in a Time-Division-
   Multiplexing (TDM) / Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) matrix
   called the Channel distribution/usage (CDU) to either individual
   transmissions or as multi-access shared resources (see the 6TiSCH
   Terminology [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology] for more on these terms).
   Scheduling effectively enables multiple communications at a same time
   in a same interference domain using different channels; but a node
   equipped with a single radio can only transmit or receive on one
   channel at any given point of time.

   From the standpoint of a 6TiSCH node (at the MAC layer), its schedule
   is the collection of the times at which it must wake up for
   transmission, and the channels to which it should either send or
   listen at those times.  The schedule is expressed as one or more
   slotframes that repeat over and over.  Slotframes may collision and
   require a device to wake at a same time, in which case a priority
   indicates which slotframe is actually activated.

   The 6top sublayer hides the complexity of the schedule to the upper
   layers.  The Link that IP may utilize between the 6TiSCH node and a
   peer may in fact be composed of a pair of cell bundles, one to
   receive and one to transmit.  Some of the cells may be shared, in
   which case the 6top sublayer must perform some arbitration.

   The 6TiSCH architecture identifies four ways a schedule can be
   managed and CDU cells can be allocated: Static Scheduling, Neighbor-
   to-Neighbor Scheduling, Remote Monitoring and Schedule Management,
   and Hop-by-hop Scheduling.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   Static Scheduling:  This refers to the minimal 6TiSCH operation
      whereby a static schedule is configured for the whole network for
      use in a slotted-aloha fashion.  The static schedule is
      distributed through the native methods in the TSCH MAC layer.
      This operation leverages RPL to maintain a loopless graph for
      routing and time distribution.  It is specified in the Minimal
      6TiSCH Configuration [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal] specification.  and
      does not preclude other scheduling operations to co-exist on a
      same 6TiSCH network.

   Neighbor-to-Neighbor Scheduling:  This refers to the dynamic
      adaptation of the bandwidth of the Links that are used for IPv6
      traffic between adjacent routers.  Scheduling Functions such as
      SF0 [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0] influence the operation of the 6top
      sublayer [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer] to add and remove cells
      in peers schedule, using the 6top protocol
      [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol] for the negotiation on the MAC
      resources.

   Remote Monitoring and Schedule Management:  This refers to the
      central computation of a schedule and the capability to forward a
      frame based on the cell of arrival.  In that case, the related
      portion of the device schedule as well as other device resources
      are managed by an abstract Network Management Entity (NME), which
      may cooperate with the PCE in order to minimize the interaction
      with and the load on the constrained device.  This model is the
      TSCH adaption of the DetNet Architecture
      [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture], and it enables Traffic Engineering
      with deterministic properties.

   Hop-by-hop Scheduling:  This refers to the possibility to reserves
      cells along a path for a particular flow using a distributed
      mechanism.

   It is not expected that all use cases will require all those
   mechanisms.  Static Scheduling with minimal configuration one is the
   only one that is expected in all implementations, since it provides a
   simple and solid basis for convergecast routing and time
   distribution.

   A deeper dive in those mechanisms can be found in Section 4.4.

3.4.  Routing and Forwarding Over TSCH

   6TiSCH leverages the RPL routing protocol for interoperable
   distributed routing operations.  RPL is applicable to Static
   Scheduling and Neighbor-to-Neighbor Scheduling.  The architecture
   also supports a centralized routing model for Remote Monitoring and



Thubert                 Expires December 12, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   Schedule Management.  It is expected that a routing protocol that is
   more optimized for point-to-point routing than RPL, such as the
   Reactive Discovery of Point-to-Point Routes in Low-Power and Lossy
   Networks [RFC6997](P2P RPL), or the Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector
   Routing (AODV) [I-D.ietf-manet-aodvv2] will be selected for Hop-by-
   hop Scheduling.

   The 6TiSCH architecture supports three different forwarding models,
   the classical IPv6 Forwarding, where the node selects a feasible
   successor at Layer-3 on a per packet basis and based on its routing
   table, G-MPLS Track Forwarding, which switches a frame received at a
   particular Timeslot into another Timeslot at Layer-2, and 6LoWPAN
   Fragment Forwarding, which allows to forward individual 6loWPAN
   fragments along the route set by the first fragment.

   IPv6 Forwarding:  This is the classical IP forwarding model, with a
      Routing Information Based (RIB) that is installed by the RPL
      routing protocol and used to select a feasible successor per
      packet.  The packet is placed on an outgoing Link, that the 6top
      layer maps into a (Layer-3) bundle of cells, and scheduled for
      transmission based on QoS parameters.  On top of RPL, this model
      also applies to any routing protocol which may be operated in the
      6TiSCH network, and corresponds to all the distributed scheduling
      models, Static, Neighbor-to-Neighbor and Hop-by-Hop Scheduling.

   G-MPLS Track Forwarding:  This model corresponds to the Remote
      Monitoring and Schedule Management.  In this model, A central
      controller (hosting a PCE) computes and installs the schedules in
      the devices per flow.  The incoming (Layer-2) bundle of cells from
      the previous node along the path determines the outgoing (Layer-2)
      bundle towards the next hop for that flow as determined by the
      PCE.  The programmed sequence for bundles is called a Track and
      can assume shapes that are more complex than a simple direct
      sequence of nodes.

   6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding:  This is an hybrid model that derives
      from IPv6 forwarding for the case where packets must be fragmented
      at the 6LoWPAN sublayer.  The first fragment is forwarded like any
      IPv6 packet and leaves a state in the intermediate hops to enable
      forwarding of the next fragments that do not have a IP header
      without the need to recompose the packet at every hop.

   This can be broadly summarized in the following table:

3.5.  A Non-Broadcast Multi-Access Radio Mesh Network

   A 6TiSCH network is an IPv6 [RFC2460] subnet which, in its basic
   configuration, is a single Low Power Lossy Network (LLN) operating
   over a synchronized TSCH-based mesh.

   Inside a 6TiSCH LLN, nodes rely on 6LoWPAN Header Compression
   (6LoWPAN HC) [RFC6282] to encode IPv6 packets.  From the perspective
   of the network layer, a single LLN interface (typically an
   IEEE802.15.4-compliant radio) may be seen as a collection of Links
   with different capabilities for unicast or multicast services.

   6TiSCH nodes are not necessarily reachable from one another at
   Layer-2 and an LLN may span over multiple links.  This effectively
   forms an homogeneous non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA) subnet, which
   is beyond the scope of existing IPv6 ND methods.  Extensions to IPv6
   ND have to be introduced.

   Within that subnet, neighbor devices are discovered with 6LoWPAN
   Neighbor Discovery [RFC6775] (6LoWPAN ND), whereas RPL [RFC6550]
   enables routing in the so called Route Over fashion, either in
   storing (stateful) or non-storing (stateless, with routing headers)
   mode.

             Figure 3: Basic Configuration of a 6TiSCH Network

   6TiSCH nodes join the mesh by attaching to nodes that are already
   members of the mesh.  Some nodes act as routers for 6LoWPAN ND and
   RPL operations, as detailed in Section 4.1.  Security aspects of the
   join process by which a device obtains access to the network are
   discussed in Section 6.

   With TSCH, devices are time-synchronized at the MAC level.  The use
   of a particular RPL Instance for time synchronization is discussed in
   Section 4.2.4.  With this mechanism, the time synchronization starts
   at the RPL root and follows the RPL DODAGs with no timing loop.

   RPL forms Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs)
   within Instances of the protocol, each Instance being associated with
   an Objective Function (OF) to form a routing topology.  A particular
   6TiSCH node, the LLN Border Router (LBR), acts as RPL root, 6LoWPAN
   HC terminator, and Border Router for the LLN to the outside.  The LBR
   is usually powered.  More on RPL Instances can be found in section
   3.1 of RPL [RFC6550], in particular "3.1.2.  RPL Identifiers" and
   "3.1.3.  Instances, DODAGs, and DODAG Versions".  RPL adds artifacts
   in the data packets that are compressed with a 6LoWPAN addition 6LoRH
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-dispatch].

   Additional routing and scheduling protocols may be deployed to
   establish on-demand Peer-to-Peer routes with particular
   characteristics inside the 6TiSCH network.  This may be achieved in a
   centralized fashion by a PCE [PCE] that programs both the routes and
   the schedules inside the 6TiSCH nodes, or by in a distributed fashion
   using a reactive routing protocol and a Hop-by-Hop scheduling
   protocol.

   A Backbone Router may be connected to the node that acts as RPL root
   and / or 6LoWPAN 6LBR and provides connectivity to the larger campus
   / factory plant network over a high speed backbone or a back-haul

   link.  A Backbone Router may perform proxy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   (ND) [RFC4861] operations over the backbone on behalf of the 6TiSCH
   nodes so they can share a same IPv6 subnet and appear to be connected
   to the same backbone as classical devices.  A Backbone Router may
   alternatively redistribute the registration in a routing protocol
   such as OSPF [RFC5340] or BGP [RFC2545], or inject them in a mobility
   protocol such as MIPv6 [RFC6275], NEMO [RFC3963], or LISP [RFC6830].

   This architecture expects that a 6LoWPAN node can connect as a leaf
   to a RPL network, where the leaf support is the minimal functionality
   to connect as a host to a RPL network without the need to participate
   to the full routing protocol.  The architecture also expects that a
   6LoWPAN node that is not aware at all of the RPL protocol may also
   connect as a host but the specifications for this to happen are not
   available at the time of this writing.

3.6.  A Multi-Link Subnet Model

   An extended configuration of the subnet comprises multiple LLNs.  The
   LLNs are interconnected and synchronized over a backbone, that can be
   wired or wireless.  The backbone can be a classical IPv6 network,
   with Neighbor Discovery operating as defined in [RFC4861] and
   [RFC4862].  This architecture requires work to standardize the the
   registration of 6LoWPAN nodes to the Backbone Routers.

   In the extended configuration, a Backbone Router (6BBR) operates as
   described in [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router].  The 6BBR performs ND
   proxy operations between the registered devices and the classical ND
   devices that are located over the backbone.  6TiSCH 6BBRs synchronize
   with one another over the backbone, so as to ensure that the multiple
   LLNs that form the IPv6 subnet stay tightly synchronized.

   As detailed in Section 4.1 the 6LoWPAN ND 6LBR and the root of the
   RPL network need to be collocated and share information about the
   devices that is learned through either protocol but not both.  The
   combined RPL root and 6LBR may be collocated with the 6BBR, or
   directly attached to the 6BBR.  In the latter case, it leverages the
   extended registration process defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router] to proxy the 6LoWPAN ND registration
   to the 6BBR on behalf of the LLN nodes, so that the 6BBR may in turn
   perform proxy classical ND operations over the backbone.

   If the Backbone is Deterministic (such as defined by the Time
   Sensitive Networking WG at IEEE), then the Backbone Router ensures
   that the end-to-end deterministic behavior is maintained between the
   LLN and the backbone.  The DetNet Architecture
   [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture] studies Layer-3 aspects of
   Deterministic Networks, and covers networks that span multiple
   Layer-2 domains.

3.7.  Join Process and Registration

   As detailed in Section 4.1 the combined 6LoWPAN ND 6LBR and root of
   the RPL network learn information such as the device Unique ID (from
   6LoWPAN ND) and the updated Sequence Number (from RPL), and perform
   6LoWPAN ND proxy registration to the 6BBR of behalf of the LLN nodes.
   Figure 5 illustrates the periodic signaling that starts at the leaf

   node with 6LoWPAN ND, is then carried over RPL to the RPL root, and
   then to the 6BBR.  Efficient ND being an adaptation of 6LoWPAN ND, it
   makes sense to keep those two homogeneous in the way they use the
   source and the target addresses in the Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
   messages for registration, as well as in the options that they use
   for that process.

          Figure 5: (Re-)Registration Flow over Multi-Link Subnet

   As the network builds up, a node should start as a leaf to join the
   RPL network, and may later turn into both a RPL-capable router and a
   6LR, so as to accept leaf nodes to recursively join the network.

3.8.  Dependencies on Work In Progress

   In order to control the complexity and the size of the 6TiSCH work,
   the architecture and the associated IETF work are staged and the WG
   is expected to recharter multiple times.  This document is
   incremented as the work progresses following the evolution of the WG
   charter and the availability of dependent work.  The intent is to
   publish when the WG concludes.

   At the time of this writing:

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   o  The architecture of the operation of RPL over a dynamic schedule
      is being studied at 6TISCH as the second iteration of the charter.

   o  The need of a reactive routing protocol to establish on-demand
      constraint-optimized routes and a reservation protocol to
      establish Layer-3 Tracks is being discussed at 6TiSCH but not
      chartered for.

   o  the components and protocols that are required to implement this
      stage of architecture are not fully available from the IETF.  In
      particular, the requirements on an evolution of 6LoWPAN Neighbor
      Discovery that are needed to implement the Backbone Router as
      covered by this stage of the architecture are detailed in
      [I-D.thubert-6lo-rfc6775-update-reqs], and a number of those
      requirements are fulfilled in [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router].

   o  The work on centralized Track computation is deferred to a
      subsequent iteration of the 6TiSCH charter.  The idea at the time
      of this writing is that 6TiSCH will apply the concepts of
      Deterministic Networking on a Layer-3 network.  The 6TiSCH
      Architecture should thus inherit from the DetNet
      [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture] architecture and thus depends on
      it.  The Path Computation Element (PCE) should be a core component
      of that architecture.  Around the PCE, a protocol such as an
      extension to a TEAS [TEAS] protocol will be required to expose the
      6TiSCH node capabilities and the network peers to the PCE, and a
      protocol such as a lightweight PCEP or an adaptation of CCAMP
      [CCAMP] G-MPLS formats and procedures will be used to publish the
      Tracks, as computed by the PCE, to the 6TiSCH nodes.

   o  The security model and in particular the join process are being
      discussed at 6lo and 6TiSCH.  PANA is presented in Section 3.1 as
      a candidate of choice for the join process but alternatives are
      discussed.  Work resulting from [ACE] could be considered as well.
      Related contributions are presented in Appendix A.

   o  The current charter positions 6TiSCH on IEEE802.15.4 only.  Though
      most of the design should be portable on other link types, 6TiSCH
      has a strong dependency on IEEE802.15.4 and its evolution.  At the
      time of this writing, a revision of the IEEE802.15.4 standard is
      expected early 2016.  That revision should integrate TSCH as well
      as other amendments and fixes into the main specification.  The
      impact on this Architecture should be minimal to non-existent, but
      deeper work such as 6top and security may be impacted.  A 6TiSCH
      Interest Group was formed at IEEE to maintain the synchronization
      and help foster work at the IEEE should 6TiSCH demand it.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   o  Work is being proposed at IEEE (802.15.12 PAR) for an LLC that
      would logically include the 6top sublayer.  The interaction with
      the 6top sublayer and the Scheduling Functions described in this
      document are yet to be defined.

   o  ISA100 [ISA100] Common Network Management (CNM) is another
      external work of interest for 6TiSCH.  The group, referred to as
      ISA100.20, defines a Common Network Management framework that
      should enable the management of resources that are controlled by
      heterogeneous protocols such as ISA100.11a [ISA100.11a],
      WirelessHART [WirelessHART], and 6TiSCH.  Interestingly, the
      establishment of 6TiSCH Deterministic paths, called Tracks, are
      also in scope, and ISA100.20 is working on requirements for
      DetNet.

4.  Deeper Dive

4.1.  6LoWPAN (and RPL)

4.1.1.  RPL Leaf Support in 6LoWPAN ND

   RPL needs a set of information in order to advertise a leaf node
   through a DAO message and establish reachability.

   At the bare minimum the leaf device must provide a sequence number
   that matches the RPL specification in section 7.  Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router], on the Extended Address Registration
   Option (EARO), already incorporates that addition with a new field in
   the option called the Transaction ID.

   If for some reason the node is aware of RPL topologies, then
   providing the RPL InstanceID for the instances to which the node
   wishes to participate would be a welcome addition.  In the absence of
   such information, the RPL router must infer the proper instanceID
   from external rules and policies.

   On the backbone, the InstanceID is expected to be mapped onto a an
   overlay that matches the instanceID, for instance a VLANID.

   This architecture leverages [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router] that
   extends 6LoWPAN ND [RFC6775] to carry the counter as an abstract
   Transaction ID (TID).

4.1.2.  RPL Root And 6LBR

   6LoWPAN ND is unclear on how the 6LBR is discovered, and how the
   liveliness of the 6LBR is asserted over time.  On the other hand, the
   discovery and liveliness of the RPL root are obtained through the RPL



Thubert                 Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   protocol.  This architecture suggests to collocate these functions by
   default, in which case the discovery of the 6LBR is automatic for RPL
   leaves.

   When 6LoWPAN ND is coupled with RPL, the 6LBR and RPL root
   functionalities are co-located in order that the address of the 6LBR
   be indicated by RPL DIO messages and to associate the unique ID from
   the DAR/DAC exchange with the state that is maintained by RPL.  The
   DAR/DAC exchange becomes a preamble to the DAO messages that are used
   from then on to reconfirm the registration, thus eliminating a
   duplication of functionality between DAO and DAR messages.

   Even though the root of the RPL network is integrated with the 6LBR,
   it is logically separated from the Backbone Router (6BBR) that is
   used to connect the 6TiSCH LLN to the backbone.  This way, the root
   has all information from 6LoWPAN ND and RPL about the LLN devices
   attached to it.

   This architecture also expects that the root of the RPL network
   (proxy-)registers the 6TiSCH nodes on their behalf to the 6BBR, for
   whatever operation the 6BBR performs on the backbone, such as ND
   proxy, or redistribution in a routing protocol.  This relies on an
   extension of the 6LoWPAN ND registration described in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router].

   This model supports the movement of a 6TiSCH device across the Multi-
   Link Subnet, and allows the proxy registration of 6TiSCH nodes deep
   into the 6TiSCH LLN by the 6LBR / RPL root.  This requires an
   alteration from [RFC6775] whereby the Target Address of the NS
   message is registered as opposed to the Source, which, in the case of
   a proxy registration, is that of the 6LBR / RPL root itself.

4.2.  TSCH and 6top

4.2.1.  6top

   6top is a logical link control sitting between the IP layer and the
   TSCH MAC layer, which provides the link abstraction that is required
   for IP operations.  The 6top operations are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol].  In particular, 6top provides a
   management interface that enables an external management entity to
   schedule cells and slotFrames, and allows the addition of
   complementary functionality, for instance to support a dynamic
   schedule management based on observed resource usage as discussed in
   Section 4.4.2.

   The 6top data model and management interfaces are further discussed
   in Section 4.4.3.

4.2.1.1.  Hard Cells

   The architecture defines "soft" cells and "hard" cells.  "Hard" cells
   are owned and managed by an separate scheduling entity (e.g. a PCE)
   that specifies the slotOffset/channelOffset of the cells to be
   added/moved/deleted, in which case 6top can only act as instructed,
   and may not move hard cells in the TSCH schedule on its own.

4.2.1.2.  Soft Cells

   6top contains a monitoring process which monitors the performance of
   cells, and can move a cell in the TSCH schedule when it performs
   poorly.  This is only applicable to cells which are marked as "soft".
   To reserve a soft cell, the higher layer does not indicate the exact
   slotOffset/channelOffset of the cell to add, but rather the resulting
   bandwidth and QoS requirements.  When the monitoring process triggers
   a cell reallocation, the two neighbor devices communicating over this
   cell negotiate its new position in the TSCH schedule.

4.2.2.  Scheduling Functions and the 6P protocol

   In the case of soft cells, the cell management entity that controls
   the dynamic attribution of cells to adapt to the dynamics of variable
   rate flows is called a Scheduling Function (SF).  There may be
   multiple SFs with more or less aggressive reaction to the dynamics of
   the network.  The 6TiSCH 6top Scheduling Function Zero (SF0)
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0] provides a simple scheduling function that
   can be used by default by devices that support dynamic scheduling of
   soft cells.

   The SF may be seen as divided between an upper bandwidth adaptation
   logic that is not aware of the particular technology that is used to
   obtain and release bandwidth, and an underlying service that maps
   those needs in the actual technology, which means mapping the
   bandwidth onto cells in the case of TSCH.

                       Figure 6: SF/6P stack in 6top

   The SF relies on 6top services that implement the 6top Protocol (6P)
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol] to negotiate the precise cells that
   will be allocated or freed based on the schedule of the peer.  It may
   be for instance that a peer wants to use a particular time slot that
   is free in its schedule, but that timeslot is already in use by the
   other peer for a communication with a third party on a different
   cell.  The 6P protocol enables the peers to find an agreement in a
   transactional manner that ensures the final consistency of the nodes
   state.

4.2.3.  6top and RPL Objective Function operations

   An implementation of a RPL [RFC6550] Objective Function (OF), such as
   the RPL Objective Function Zero (OF0) [RFC6552] that is used in the
   Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal] to support RPL
   over a static schedule, may leverage, for its internal computation,
   the information maintained by 6top.

   Most OFs require metrics about reachability, such as the ETX.  6top
   creates and maintains an abstract neighbor table, and this state may
   be leveraged to feed an OF and/or store OF information as well.  In
   particular, 6top creates and maintains an abstract neighbor table.  A
   neighbor table entry contains a set of statistics with respect to
   that specific neighbor including the time when the last packet has
   been received from that neighbor, a set of cell quality metrics (e.g.
   RSSI or LQI), the number of packets sent to the neighbor or the
   number of packets received from it.  This information can be obtained
   through 6top management APIs as detailed in the 6top sublayer
   specification [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer] and used for instance
   to compute a Rank Increment that will determine the selection of the
   preferred parent.

   6top provides statistics about the underlying layer so the OF can be
   tuned to the nature of the TSCH MAC layer. 6top also enables the RPL
   OF to influence the MAC behaviour, for instance by configuring the

   periodicity of IEEE802.15.4 Extended Beacons (EB's).  By augmenting
   the EB periodicity, it is possible to change the network dynamics so
   as to improve the support of devices that may change their point of
   attachment in the 6TiSCH network.

   Some RPL control messages, such as the DODAG Information Object (DIO)
   are ICMPv6 messages that are broadcast to all neighbor nodes.  With
   6TiSCH, the broadcast channel requirement is addressed by 6top by
   configuring TSCH to provide a broadcast channel, as opposed to, for
   instance, piggybacking the DIO messages in Enhance Beacons.
   Consideration was given towards finding a way to embed the Route
   Advertisements and the RPL DIO messages (both of which are multicast)
   into the IEEE802.15.4 Enhanced Beacons.  It was determined that this
   produced undue timer coupling among layers, that the resulting packet
   size was potentially too large, and required it is not yet clear that
   there is any need for Enhanced Beacons in a production network.

4.2.4.  Network Synchronization

   Nodes in a TSCH network must be time synchronized.  A node keeps
   synchronized to its time source neighbor through a combination of
   frame-based and acknowledgment-based synchronization.  In order to
   maximize battery life and network throughput, it is advisable that
   RPL ICMP discovery and maintenance traffic (governed by the trickle
   timer) be somehow coordinated with the transmission of time
   synchronization packets (especially with enhanced beacons).  This
   could be achieved through an interaction of the 6top sublayer and the
   RPL objective Function, or could be controlled by a management
   entity.

   Time distribution requires a loop-less structure.  Nodes taken in a
   synchronization loop will rapidly desynchronize from the network and
   become isolated.  It is expected that a RPL DAG with a dedicated
   global Instance is deployed for the purpose of time synchronization.
   That Instance is referred to as the Time Synchronization Global
   Instance (TSGI).  The TSGI can be operated in either of the 3 modes
   that are detailed in section 3.1.3 of RPL [RFC6550], "Instances,
   DODAGs, and DODAG Versions".  Multiple uncoordinated DODAGs with
   independent roots may be used if all the roots share a common time
   source such as the Global Positioning System (GPS).  In the absence
   of a common time source, the TSGI should form a single DODAG with a
   virtual root.  A backbone network is then used to synchronize and
   coordinate RPL operations between the backbone routers that act as
   sinks for the LLN.  Optionally, RPL's periodic operations may be used
   to transport the network synchronization.  This may mean that 6top
   would need to trigger (override) the trickle timer if no other
   traffic has occurred for such a time that nodes may get out of
   synchronization.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   A node that has not joined the TSGI advertises a MAC level Join
   Priority of 0xFF to notify its neighbors that is not capable of
   serving as time parent.  A node that has joined the TSGI advertises a
   MAC level Join Priority set to its DAGRank() in that Instance, where
   DAGRank() is the operation specified in section 3.5.1 of [RFC6550],
   "Rank Comparison".

   A root is configured or obtains by some external means the knowledge
   of the RPLInstanceID for the TSGI.  The root advertises its DagRank
   in the TSGI, that must be less than 0xFF, as its Join Priority (JP)
   in its IEEE802.15.4 Extended Beacons (EB).  We'll note that the JP is
   now specified between 0 and 0x3F leaving 2 bits in the octet unused
   in the IEEE802.15.4e specification.  After consultation with IEEE
   authors, it was asserted that 6TiSCH can make a full use of the octet
   to carry an integer value up to 0xFF.

   A node that reads a Join Priority of less than 0xFF should join the
   neighbor with the lesser Join Priority and use it as time parent.  If
   the node is configured to serve as time parent, then the node should
   join the TSGI, obtain a Rank in that Instance and start advertising
   its own DagRank in the TSGI as its Join Priority in its EBs.

4.2.5.  SlotFrames and Priorities

   6TiSCH enables in essence the capability to use IPv6 over a MAC layer
   that enables to schedule some of the transmissions.  In order to
   ensure that the medium is free of contending packets when time
   arrives for a scheduled transmission, a window of time is defined
   around the scheduled transmission time where the medium must be free
   of contending energy.

   One simple way to obtain such a window is to format time and
   frequencies in cells of transmission of equal duration.  This is the
   method that is adopted in IEEE802.15.4 TSCH as well as the Long Term
   Evolution (LTE) of cellular networks.

   In order to describe that formatting of time and frequencies, the
   6TiSCH architecture defines a global concept that is called a Channel
   Distribution and Usage (CDU) matrix; a CDU matrix is a matrix of
   cells with an height equal to the number of available channels
   (indexed by ChannelOffsets) and a width (in timeslots) that is the
   period of the network scheduling operation (indexed by slotOffsets)
   for that CDU matrix.  The size of a cell is a timeslot duration, and
   values of 10 to 15 milliseconds are typical in 802.15.4 TSCH to
   accommodate for the transmission of a frame and an ack, including the
   security validation on the receive side which may take up to a few
   milliseconds on some device architecture.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   A CDU matrix iterates over and over with a pseudo-random rotation
   from an epoch time.  In a given network, there might be multiple CDU
   matrices that operate with different width, so they have different
   durations and represent different periodic operations.  It is
   recommended that all CDU matrices in a 6TiSCH domain operate with the
   same cell duration and are aligned, so as to reduce the chances of
   interferences from slotted-aloha operations.  The knowledge of the
   CDU matrices is shared between all the nodes and used in particular
   to define slotFrames.

   A slotFrame is a MAC-level abstraction that is common to all nodes
   and contains a series of timeslots of equal length and precedence.
   It is characterized by a slotFrame_ID, and a slotFrame_size.  A
   slotFrame aligns to a CDU matrix for its parameters, such as number
   and duration of timeslots.

   Multiple slotFrames can coexist in a node schedule, i.e., a node can
   have multiple activities scheduled in different slotFrames, based on
   the precedence of the 6TiSCH topologies.  The slotFrames may be
   aligned to different CDU matrices and thus have different width.
   There is typically one slotFrame for scheduled traffic that has the
   highest precedence and one or more slotFrame(s) for RPL traffic.  The
   timeslots in the slotFrame are indexed by the SlotOffset; the first
   cell is at SlotOffset 0.

   When a packet is received from a higher layer for transmission, 6top
   inserts that packet in the outgoing queue which matches the packet
   best (Differentiated Services [RFC2474] can therefore be used).  At
   each scheduled transmit slot, 6top looks for the frame in all the
   outgoing queues that best matches the cells.  If a frame is found, it
   is given to the TSCH MAC for transmission.

4.2.6.  Distributing the reservation of cells

   6TiSCH expects a high degree of scalability together with a
   distributed routing functionality based on RPL.  To achieve this
   goal, the spectrum must be allocated in a way that allows for spatial
   reuse between zones that will not interfere with one another.  In a
   large and spatially distributed network, a 6TiSCH node is often in a
   good position to determine usage of spectrum in its vicinity.

   Use cases for distributed routing are often associated with a
   statistical distribution of best-effort traffic with variable needs
   for bandwidth on each individual link.  With 6TiSCH, the abstraction
   of an IPv6 link is implemented as a pair of bundles of cells, one in
   each direction; the size of a bundle is optimal when both the energy
   wasted idle listening and the packet drops due to congestion loss are
   minimized.  This can be maintained if the number of cells in a bundle



Thubert                 Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 22]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   is adapted dynamically, and with enough reactivity, to match the
   variations of best-effort traffic.  In turn, the agility to fulfill
   the needs for additional cells improves when the number of
   interactions with other devices and the protocol latencies are
   minimized.

   6TiSCH limits that interaction to RPL parents that will only
   negotiate with other RPL parents, and performs that negotiation by
   groups of cells as opposed to individual cells.  The 6TiSCH
   architecture allows RPL parents to adjust dynamically, and
   independently from the PCE, the amount of bandwidth that is used to
   communicate between themselves and their children, in both
   directions; to that effect, an allocation mechanism enables a RPL
   parent to obtain the exclusive use of a portion of a CDU matrix
   within its interference domain.  Note that a PCE is expected to have
   precedence in the allocation, so that a RPL parent would only be able
   to obtain portions that are not in-use by the PCE.

   The 6TiSCH architecture introduces the concept of chunks
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology]) to operate such spectrum distribution
   for a whole group of cells at a time.  The CDU matrix is formatted
   into a set of chunks, each of them identified uniquely by a chunk-ID.
   The knowledge of this formatting is shared between all the nodes in a
   6TiSCH network. 6TiSCH also defines the process of chunk ownership
   appropriation whereby a RPL parent discovers a chunk that is not used
   in its interference domain (e.g lack of energy detected in reference
   cells in that chunk); then claims the chunk, and then defends it in
   case another RPL parent would attempt to appropriate it while it is
   in use.  The chunk is the basic unit of ownership that is used in
   that process.

   As a result of the process of chunk ownership appropriation, the RPL
   parent has exclusive authority to decide which cell in the

   appropriated chunk can be used by which node in its interference
   domain.  In other words, it is implicitly delegated the right to
   manage the portion of the CDU matrix that is represented by the
   chunk.  The RPL parent may thus orchestrate which transmissions occur
   in any of the cells in the chunk, by allocating cells from the chunk
   to any form of communication (unicast, multicast) in any direction
   between itself and its children.  Initially, those cells are added to
   the heap of free cells, then dynamically placed into existing
   bundles, in new bundles, or allocated opportunistically for one
   transmission.

   The appropriation of a chunk can also be requested explicitly by the
   PCE to any node.  In that case, the node still may need to perform
   the appropriation process to validate that no other node has claimed
   that chunk already.  After a successful appropriation, the PCE owns
   the cells in that chunk, and may use them as hard cells to set up
   Tracks.

4.3.  Communication Paradigms and Interaction Models

   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology] defines the terms of Communication
   Paradigms and Interaction Models, which can be placed in parallel to
   the Information Models and Data Models that are defined in [RFC3444].

   A Communication Paradigms would be an abstract view of a protocol
   exchange, and would come with an Information Model for the
   information that is being exchanged.  In contrast, an Interaction
   Models would be more refined and could point on standard operation
   such as a Representational state transfer (REST) "GET" operation and
   would match a Data Model for the data that is provided over the
   protocol exchange.

   section 2.1.3 of [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability] and
   next sections discuss application-layer paradigms, such as Source-
   sink (SS) that is a Multipeer to Multipeer (MP2MP) model primarily
   used for alarms and alerts, Publish-subscribe (PS, or pub/sub) that
   is typically used for sensor data, as well as Peer-to-peer (P2P) and
   Peer-to-multipeer (P2MP) communications.  Additional considerations
   on Duocast and its N-cast generalization are also provided.  Those
   paradigms are frequently used in industrial automation, which is a
   major use case for IEEE802.15.4 TSCH wireless networks with
   [ISA100.11a] and [WirelessHART], that provides a wireless access to
   [HART] applications and devices.

   This specification focuses on Communication Paradigms and Interaction
   Models for packet forwarding and TSCH resources (cells) management.
   Management mechanisms for the TSCH schedule at Link-layer (one-hop),
   Network-layer (multithop along a Track), and Application-layer

   (remote control) are discussed in Section 4.4.  Link-layer frame
   forwarding interactions are discussed in Section 4.5, and Network-
   layer Packet routing is addressed in Section 4.6.

4.4.  Schedule Management Mechanisms

   6TiSCH uses 4 paradigms to manage the TSCH schedule of the LLN nodes:
   Static Scheduling, neighbor-to-neighbor Scheduling, remote monitoring
   and scheduling management, and Hop-by-hop scheduling.  Multiple
   mechanisms are defined that implement the associated Interaction
   Models, and can be combined and used in the same LLN.  Which
   mechanism(s) to use depends on application requirements.

4.4.1.  Static Scheduling

   In the simplest instantiation of a 6TiSCH network, a common fixed
   schedule may be shared by all nodes in the network.  Cells are
   shared, and nodes contend for slot access in a slotted aloha manner.

   A static TSCH schedule can be used to bootstrap a network, as an
   initial phase during implementation, or as a fall-back mechanism in
   case of network malfunction.  This schedule is pre-established, for
   instance decided by a network administrator based on operational
   needs.  It can be pre-configured into the nodes, or, more commonly,
   learned by a node when joining the network using standard
   IEEE802.15.4 Information Elements (IE).  Regardless, the schedule
   remains unchanged after the node has joined a network.  RPL is used
   on the resulting network.  This "minimal" scheduling mechanism that
   implements this paradigm is detailed in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal].

4.4.2.  Neighbor-to-neighbor Scheduling

   In the simplest instantiation of a 6TiSCH network described in
   Section 4.4.1, nodes may expect a packet at any cell in the schedule
   and will waste energy idle listening.  In a more complex
   instantiation of a 6TiSCH network, a matching portion of the schedule
   is established between peers to reflect the observed amount of
   transmissions between those nodes.  The aggregation of the cells
   between a node and a peer forms a bundle that the 6top layer uses to
   implement the abstraction of a link for IP.  The bandwidth on that
   link is proportional to the number of cells in the bundle.

   If the size of a bundle is configured to fit an average amount of
   bandwidth, peak traffic is dropped.  If the size is configured to
   allow for peak emissions, energy is be wasted idle listening.

   The 6top sublayer [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer] defines a protocol
   for neighbor nodes to reserve soft cells to transmit to one another.



Thubert                 Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   Because this reservation is done without global knowledge of the
   schedule of nodes in the LLN, scheduling collisions are possible.
   6top defines a monitoring process which continuously Tracks the
   packet delivery ratio of soft cells.  It uses these statistics to
   trigger the reallocation of a soft cell in the schedule, using a
   negotiation protocol between the neighbors nodes communicating over
   that cell.

   In the most efficient instantiations of a 6TiSCH network, the size of
   the bundles that implement the links may be changed dynamically in
   order to adapt to the need of end-to-end flows routed by RPL.  An
   optional Scheduling Function (SF) such as SF0
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0] is used to monitor bandwidth usage and
   perform requests for dynamic allocation by the 6top sublayer.  The SF
   component is not part of the 6top sublayer.  It may be collocated on
   the same device or may be partially or fully offloaded to an external
   system.

   Monitoring and relocation is done in the 6top layer.  For the upper
   layer, the connection between two neighbor nodes appears as an number
   of cells.  Depending on traffic requirements, the upper layer can
   request 6top to add or delete a number of cells scheduled to a
   particular neighbor, without being responsible for choosing the exact
   slotOffset/channelOffset of those cells.

4.4.3.  Remote Monitoring and Schedule Management

   The 6top interface document [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-interface]
   specifies the generic data model that can be used to monitor and
   manage resources of the 6top sublayer.  Abstract methods are
   suggested for use by a management entity in the device.  The data
   model also enables remote control operations on the 6top sublayer.

   The capability to interact with the node 6top sublayer from multiple
   hops away can be leveraged for monitoring, scheduling, or a
   combination of thereof.  The architecture supports variations on the
   deployment model, and focuses on the flows rather than whether there
   is a proxy or a translation operation en-route.

   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-coap] defines an mapping of the 6top set of
   commands, which is described in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-interface], to
   CoAP resources.  This allows an entity to interact with the 6top
   layer of a node that is multiple hops away in a RESTful fashion.

   The entity issuing the CoAP requests can be a central scheduling
   entity (e.g. a PCE), a node multiple hops away with the authority to
   modify the TSCH schedule (e.g. the head of a local cluster), or a
   external device monitoring the overall state of the network (e.g.

   NME).  It is also possible that a mapping entity on the backbone
   transforms a non-CoAP protocol such as PCEP into the RESTful
   interfaces that the 6TiSCH devices support.

   With respect to Centralized routing and scheduling, the 6TiSCH
   Architecture is (expected to be) be an extension of the detnet work
   Deterministic Networking Architecture [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture],
   which studies Layer-3 aspects of Deterministic Networks, and covers
   networks that span multiple Layer-2 domains.  The DetNet architecture
   is a form of SDN Architecture and is composed of three planes, a
   (User) Application Plane, a Controller Plane (where the PCE

   network (e.g. a 6TiSCH LLN and an Ethernet Backbone).  This model
   fits the 6TiSCH extended configuration, whereby a 6BBR federates
   multiple 6TiSCH LLN in a single subnet over a backbone that can be,
   for instance, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.  In that model, 6TiSCH 6BBRs
   synchronize with one another over the backbone, so as to ensure that
   the multiple LLNs that form the IPv6 subnet stay tightly
   synchronized.

   If the Backbone is Deterministic, then the Backbone Router ensures
   that the end-to-end deterministic behavior is maintained between the
   LLN and the backbone.  It is the responsibility of the PCE to compute
   a deterministic path and to end across the TSCH network and an
   IEEE802.1 TSN Ethernet backbone, and that of DetNet to enable end-to-
   end deterministic forwarding.

4.4.4.  Hop-by-hop Scheduling

   A node can reserve a Track to a destination node multiple hops away
   by installing soft cells at each intermediate node.  This forms a
   Track of soft cells.  It is the responsibility of the 6top sublayer
   of each node on the Track to monitor these soft cells and trigger
   relocation when needed.

   This hop-by-hop reservation mechanism is expected to be similar in
   essence to [RFC3209] and/or [RFC4080]/[RFC5974].  The protocol for a
   node to trigger hop-by-hop scheduling is not yet defined.

4.5.  Forwarding Models

   By forwarding, this specification means the per-packet operation that
   allows to deliver a packet to a next hop or an upper layer in this
   node.  Forwarding is based on pre-existing state that was installed
   as a result of a routing computation Section 4.6.  6TiSCH supports
   three different forwarding model, G-MPLS Track Forwarding (TF),
   6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding (FF) and IPv6 Forwarding (6F).

4.5.1.  Track Forwarding

   A Track is a directional path between a source and a destination.  In
   a Track cell, the normal operation of IEEE802.15.4 Automatic Repeat-
   reQuest (ARQ) usually happens, though the acknowledgment may be
   omitted in some cases, for instance if there is no scheduled cell for
   a retry.

   Track Forwarding is the simplest and fastest.  A bundle of cells set
   to receive (RX-cells) is uniquely paired to a bundle of cells that
   are set to transmit (TX-cells), representing a layer-2 forwarding
   state that can be used regardless of the network layer protocol.

   This model can effectively be seen as a Generalized Multi-protocol
   Label Switching (G-MPLS) operation in that the information used to
   switch a frame is not an explicit label, but rather related to other
   properties of the way the packet was received, a particular cell in
   the case of 6TiSCH.  As a result, as long as the TSCH MAC (and
   Layer-2 security) accepts a frame, that frame can be switched
   regardless of the protocol, whether this is an IPv6 packet, a 6LoWPAN
   fragment, or a frame from an alternate protocol such as WirelessHART
   or ISA100.11a.

   A data frame that is forwarded along a Track normally has a
   destination MAC address that is set to broadcast - or a multicast
   address depending on MAC support.  This way, the MAC layer in the
   intermediate nodes accepts the incoming frame and 6top switches it
   without incurring a change in the MAC header.  In the case of
   IEEE802.15.4, this means effectively broadcast, so that along the
   Track the short address for the destination of the frame is set to
   0xFFFF.

   A Track is thus formed end-to-end as a succession of paired bundles,
   a receive bundle from the previous hop and a transmit bundle to the
   next hop along the Track, and a cell in such a bundle belongs to at
   most one Track.  For a given iteration of the device schedule, the
   effective channel of the cell is obtained by adding a pseudo-random
   number to the channelOffset of the cell, which results in a rotation
   of the frequency that used for transmission.  The bundles may be
   computed so as to accommodate both variable rates and
   retransmissions, so they might not be fully used at a given iteration
   of the schedule.  The 6TiSCH architecture provides additional means
   to avoid waste of cells as well as overflows in the transmit bundle,
   as follows:

   In one hand, a TX-cell that is not needed for the current iteration
   may be reused opportunistically on a per-hop basis for routed
   packets.  When all of the frame that were received for a given Track
   are effectively transmitted, any available TX-cell for that Track can
   be reused for upper layer traffic for which the next-hop router
   matches the next hop along the Track.  In that case, the cell that is
   being used is effectively a TX-cell from the Track, but the short
   address for the destination is that of the next-hop router.  It
   results that a frame that is received in a RX-cell of a Track with a
   destination MAC address set to this node as opposed to broadcast must
   be extracted from the Track and delivered to the upper layer (a frame
   with an unrecognized MAC address is dropped at the lower MAC layer
   and thus is not received at the 6top sublayer).

   On the other hand, it might happen that there are not enough TX-cells
   in the transmit bundle to accommodate the Track traffic, for instance

   if more retransmissions are needed than provisioned.  In that case,
   the frame can be placed for transmission in the bundle that is used
   for layer-3 traffic towards the next hop along the Track as long as
   it can be routed by the upper layer, that is, typically, if the frame
   transports an IPv6 packet.  The MAC address should be set to the
   next-hop MAC address to avoid confusion.  It results that a frame
   that is received over a layer-3 bundle may be in fact associated to a
   Track.  In a classical IP link such as an Ethernet, off-Track traffic
   is typically in excess over reservation to be routed along the non-
   reserved path based on its QoS setting.  But with 6TiSCH, since the
   use of the layer-3 bundle may be due to transmission failures, it
   makes sense for the receiver to recognize a frame that should be re-
   Tracked, and to place it back on the appropriate bundle if possible.
   A frame should be re-Tracked if the Per-Hop-Behavior group indicated
   in the Differentiated Services Field in the IPv6 header is set to
   Deterministic Forwarding, as discussed in Section 4.6.1.  A frame is
   re-Tracked by scheduling it for transmission over the transmit bundle
   associated to the Track, with the destination MAC address set to
   broadcast.

   There are 2 modes for a Track, transport mode and tunnel mode.

4.5.1.1.  Transport Mode

   In transport mode, the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is associated with
   flow-dependant meta-data that refers uniquely to the Track, so the
   6top sublayer can place the frame in the appropriate cell without
   ambiguity.  In the case of IPv6 traffic, this flow identification is
   transported in the Flow Label of the IPv6 header.  Associated with
   the source IPv6 address, the Flow Label forms a globally unique
   identifier for that particular Track that is validated at egress
   before restoring the destination MAC address (DMAC) and punting to
   the upper layer.

4.5.1.2.  Tunnel Mode

   In tunnel mode, the frames originate from an arbitrary protocol over
   a compatible MAC that may or may not be synchronized with the 6TiSCH
   network.  An example of this would be a router with a dual radio that
   is capable of receiving and sending WirelessHART or ISA100.11a frames
   with the second radio, by presenting itself as an access Point or a
   Backbone Router, respectively.

   In that mode, some entity (e.g.  PCE) can coordinate with a
   WirelessHART Network Manager or an ISA100.11a System Manager to
   specify the flows that are to be transported transparently over the
   Track.

                  Figure 9: Track Forwarding, Tunnel Mode

   In that case, the flow information that identifies the Track at the
   ingress 6TiSCH router is derived from the RX-cell.  The dmac is set
   to this node but the flow information indicates that the frame must
   be tunneled over a particular Track so the frame is not passed to the
   upper layer.  Instead, the dmac is forced to broadcast and the frame
   is passed to the 6top sublayer for switching.

   At the egress 6TiSCH router, the reverse operation occurs.  Based on
   metadata associated to the Track, the frame is passed to the
   appropriate link layer with the destination MAC restored.

4.5.1.3.  Tunnel Metadata

   Metadata coming with the Track configuration is expected to provide
   the destination MAC address of the egress endpoint as well as the
   tunnel mode and specific data depending on the mode, for instance a
   service access point for frame delivery at egress.  If the tunnel
   egress point does not have a MAC address that matches the
   configuration, the Track installation fails.

   In transport mode, if the final layer-3 destination is the tunnel
   termination, then it is possible that the IPv6 address of the
   destination is compressed at the 6LoWPAN sublayer based on the MAC
   address.  It is thus mandatory at the ingress point to validate that
   the MAC address that was used at the 6LoWPAN sublayer for compression
   matches that of the tunnel egress point.  For that reason, the node
   that injects a packet on a Track checks that the destination is
   effectively that of the tunnel egress point before it overwrites it
   to broadcast.  The 6top sublayer at the tunnel egress point reverts
   that operation to the MAC address obtained from the tunnel metadata.

4.5.2.  Fragment Forwarding

   Considering that 6LoWPAN packets can be as large as 1280 bytes (the
   IPv6 MTU), and that the non-storing mode of RPL implies Source
   Routing that requires space for routing headers, and that a
   IEEE802.15.4 frame with security may carry in the order of 80 bytes
   of effective payload, an IPv6 packet might be fragmented into more
   than 16 fragments at the 6LoWPAN sublayer.

   This level of fragmentation is much higher than that traditionally
   experienced over the Internet with IPv4 fragments, where
   fragmentation is already known as harmful.

   In the case to a multihop route within a 6TiSCH network, Hop-by-Hop
   recomposition occurs at each hop in order to reform the packet and
   route it.  This creates additional latency and forces intermediate
   nodes to store a portion of a packet for an undetermined time, thus
   impacting critical resources such as memory and battery.

   [I-D.thubert-roll-forwarding-frags] describes a mechanism whereby the
   datagram tag in the 6LoWPAN Fragment is used as a label for switching
   at the 6LoWPAN sublayer.  The draft allows for a degree of flow
   control based on an Explicit Congestion Notification, as well as end-
   to-end individual fragment recovery.

   In that model, the first fragment is routed based on the IPv6 header
   that is present in that fragment.  The 6LoWPAN sublayer learns the
   next hop selection, generates a new datagram tag for transmission to
   the next hop, and stores that information indexed by the incoming MAC
   address and datagram tag.  The next fragments are then switched based
   on that stored state.

   A bitmap and an ECN echo in the end-to-end acknowledgment enable the
   source to resend the missing fragments selectively.  The first
   fragment may be resent to carve a new path in case of a path failure.
   The ECN echo set indicates that the number of outstanding fragments

4.6.  Centralized vs. Distributed Routing

   6TiSCH supports a mixed model of centralized routes and distributed
   routes.  Centralized routes can for example be computed by a entity
   such as a PCE.  Distributed routes are computed by RPL.

   Both methods may inject routes in the Routing Tables of the 6TiSCH
   routers.  In either case, each route is associated with a 6TiSCH
   topology that can be a RPL Instance topology or a Track.  The 6TiSCH
   topology is indexed by a Instance ID, in a format that reuses the
   RPLInstanceID as defined in RPL [RFC6550].

   Both RPL and PCE rely on shared sources such as policies to define
   Global and Local RPLInstanceIDs that can be used by either method.
   It is possible for centralized and distributed routing to share a
   same topology.  Generally they will operate in different slotFrames,
   and centralized routes will be used for scheduled traffic and will
   have precedence over distributed routes in case of conflict between
   the slotFrames.

4.6.1.  Packet Marking and Handling

   All packets inside a 6TiSCH domain must carry the Instance ID that
   identifies the 6TiSCH topology that is to be used for routing and
   forwarding that packet.  The location of that information must be the
   same for all packets forwarded inside the domain.

   For packets that are routed by a PCE along a Track, the tuple formed
   by the IPv6 source address and a local RPLInstanceID in the packet
   identify uniquely the Track and associated transmit bundle.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   Additionally, an IP packet that is sent along a Track uses the
   Differentiated Services Per-Hop-Behavior Group called Deterministic
   Forwarding, as described in
   [I-D.svshah-tsvwg-deterministic-forwarding].

   For packets that are routed by RPL, that information is the
   RPLInstanceID which is carried in the RPL Packet Information, as
   discussed in section 11.2 of [RFC6550], "Loop Avoidance and
   Detection".

   The RPL Packet Information (RPI) is carried in IPv6 packets as a RPL
   option in the IPv6 Hop-By-Hop Header [RFC6553].

   A compression mechanism for the RPL packet artifacts that integrates
   the compression of IP-in-IP encapsulation and the Routing Header type
   3 [RFC6554] with that of the RPI in a 6LoWPAN dispatch/header type is
   concurrently being evaluated as [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-dispatch].

   Either way, the method and format used for encoding the RPLInstanceID
   is generalized to all 6TiSCH topological Instances, which include
   both RPL Instances and Tracks.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require IANA action.

6.  Security Considerations

   This architecture operates on IEEE802.15.4 and expects link-layer
   security to be enabled at all times between connected devices, except
   for the very first step of the device join process, where a joining
   device may need some initial, unsecured exchanges so as to obtain its
   initial key material.  Work has already started at the 6TiSCH
   Security Design Team and an overview of the current state of that
   work is presented in Section 6.1.

   Future work on 6TiSCH security and will examine in deeper detail how
   to secure transactions end-to-end, and to maintain the security
   posture of a device over its lifetime.  The result of that work will
   be described in a subsequent volume of this architecture.

6.1.  Join Process Highlights

   The architecture specifies three logical elements to describe the
   join process:

   Joining Node (JN):  Node that wishes to become part of the network;




Thubert                 Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 36]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   Join Coordination Entity (JCE)  : A Join Coordination Entity (JCE)
         that arbitrates network access and hands out network parameters
         (such as keying material);

   Join Assistant (JA),  a one-hop (radio) neighbor of the joining node
         that acts as proxy network node and may provide connectivity
         with the JCE.

   The join protocol consists of three major activities:

   Device Authentication:  The JN and the JA mutually authenticate each
         other and establish a shared key, so as to ensure on-going
         authenticated communications.  This may involve a server as a
         third party.

   Authorization:  The JA decides on whether/how to authorize a JN (if
         denied, this may result in loss of bandwidth).  Conversely, the
         JN decides on whether/how to authorize the network (if denied,
         it will not join the network).  Authorization decisions may
         involve other nodes in the network.

   Configuration/Parameterization:  The JA distributes configuration
         information to the JN, such as scheduling information, IP
         address assignment information, and network policies.  This may
         originate from other network devices, for which the JA may act
         as proxy.  This step may also include distribution of
         information from the JN to the JA and other nodes in the
         network and, more generally, synchronization of information
         between these entities.

   The device joining process is depicted in Figure 13, where it is
   assumed that devices have access to certificates and where entities
   have access to the root CA keys of their communicating parties
   (initial set-up requirement).  Under these assumptions, the
   authentication step of the device joining process does not require
   online involvement of a third party.  Mutual authentication is
   performed between the JN and the JA using their certificates, which
   also results in a shared key between these two entities.

   The JA assists the JN in mutual authentication with a remote server
   node (primarily via provision of a communication path with the
   server), which also results in a shared (end-to-end) key between
   those two entities.  The server node may be a JCE that arbitrages the
   network authorization of the JN (where the JA will deny bandwidth if
   authorization is not successful); it may distribute network-specific
   configuration parameters (including network-wide keys) to the JN.  In
   its turn, the JN may distribute and synchronize information
   (including, e.g., network statistics) to the server node and, if so



Thubert                 Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 37]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2016


   desired, also to the JA.  The actual decision of the JN to become
   part of the network may depend on authorization of the network
   itself.

   The server functionality is a role which may be implemented with one
   (centralized) or multiple devices (distributed).  In either case,
   mutual authentication is established with each physical server entity
   with which a role is implemented.

   Note that in the above description, the JA does not solely act as a
   relay node, thereby allowing it to first filter traffic to be relayed
   based on cryptographic authentication criteria - this provides first-
   level access control and mitigates certain types of denial-of-service
   attacks on the network at large.

   Depending on more detailed insight in cost/benefit trade-offs, this
   process might be complemented by a more "relaxed" mechanism, where
   the JA acts as a relay node only.  The final architecture will
   provide mechanisms to also cover cases where the initial set-up
   requirements are not met or where some other out-of-sync behavior
   occurs; it will also suggest some optimizations in case JCE-related
   information is already available with the JA (via caching of
   information).

   When a device rejoins the network in the same authorization domain,
   the authorization step could be omitted if the server distributes the
   authorization state for the device to the JA when the device
   initially joined the network.  However, this generally still requires
   the exchange of updated configuration information, e.g., related to
   time schedules and bandwidth allocation.
