Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture              July, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

1. Introduction 

   The Default Free Zone (DFZ) routing table size has been growing at an 
   increasing and potentially alarming rate for several years, which has 
   detrimental impact on the routing system scalability and the routing 
   convergence performance. This so-called routing scalability issue has 
   drawn significant attention from both industry and academia. After 
   much discussion following the IAB Routing and Addressing workshop 
   [RAWS] in Amsterdam, a common conclusion was reached that the 
   explosive growth in the DFZ routing table is mainly caused by the 
   wide adoption of multi-homing, traffic engineering and provider-
   independent address. However, the underlying reason for this issue is 
   the overloading of IP address semantics of both identifiers and 
   locators. This overloading makes it impossible to renumber IP 
   addresses in a topologically aggregatable way.  

   At present, the IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) is chartered to 
   explore a new routing and addressing architecture which is expected 
   to support the multi-homing, traffic-engineering, mobility and 
   simplified renumbering features in a more scalable way.  

   This document describes an ID/locator split approach, called Routing 
   Architecture for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI), which aims to 
   deal with the above issues. Similar with Host Identity Protocol (HIP) 
   [RFC4423], RANGI also introduces a host identifier (ID) layer between 
   the IPv6 network layer and the transport layer. As a result, the 
   transport-layer associations (i.e., TCP connections and UDP 
   associations) are no longer bound to IP addresses, but to the host 
   IDs. The major difference from the HIP is that the host IDs in RANGI 
   are hierarchical and cryptographic host IDs which have organizational 
   structure. As a result, the ID/locator mapping system for such 
   identifiers has reasonable business model and clear trust boundaries. 
   In addition, RANGI uses special IPv4-embeded IPv6 addresses as 
   locators. With such locators, site-controlled traffic-engineering can 
   be easily achieved and the renumbering burden during ISP change is 
   also eliminated greatly. Besides, the deployment cost of such a new 
   architecture is reduced greatly and the new architecture could be 
   deployed in a more incremental way. 

2. Architecture Description 

   2.1. Host Identifiers 

   Similar to HIP, RANGI is a host-based ID/locator split architecture. 
   The host IDs in RANGI are hierarchical and 128-bit long. As depicted 
   in Figure 1, a host ID consists of two parts: the leftmost n-bit

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture              July, 2009

   (Note that the suitable value of ''n'' has not been determined yet) 
   part is the Administrative Domain (AD) ID which has embedded 
   organizational affiliation and global uniqueness, and the remaining 
   part is the Local Host ID which is generated by computing a   
   cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key of the ID owner 
   and auxiliary parameters (e.g., the AD ID). The binding between the 
   public key and the host ID can be verified by re-computing the hash 
   value and by comparing the hash with the host ID. As these 
   identifiers are expected to be used along with IPv6 addresses at both 
   applications and APIs, especially in the transition mechanisms 
   defined in [RANGI-PROXY], it is desired to explicitly distinguish 
   host IDs from IPv6 addresses (i.e., locators) and vice versa.  Hence, 
   a separate prefix for identifiers should be allocated by the IANA. As 
   a result  several leftmost bits in the AD ID field should be 
   reserved for this purpose.

                    Figure 1. Host Identifier Structure 
                                      
   The approach of generating hierarchical host IDs in RANGI is similar 
   to the Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972]. The 
   major difference is that the prefix of the RANGI host ID is AD ID, 
   rather than ordinary IPv6 address prefix. In CGA, the process of 
   generating a new address takes three input values: a 64-bit subnet 
   prefix, the public key of the address owner as a DER-encoded ASN.1 
   structure of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo and the security parameter 
   Sec, which is an unsigned three-bit integer. In contrast, the process 
   of generating a new host ID in RANGI also takes three input values: 
   the n-bit AD ID, the public key of the host ID owner and the security 
   parameter Sec. Therefore, if we set the value of n to 64, host IDs 
   can be compatible with CGAs. 
    
   The benefits of the hierarchical host ID in RANGI include but not 
   limited to: 1) manage the global identifier namespace in a scalable

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture              July, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   way; 2) hold a reasonable economic model and clear trust boundaries 
   in the corresponding ID/locator mapping system; 3) ease the 
   transition from the current Internet to the RANGI.  
    
   In RANGI, the global uniqueness of host IDs is guaranteed through 
   some registration mechanism. Since the AD IDs are globally unique and 
   owned by the corresponding host ID registration and administrative 
   authorities from different countries respectively, the Local Host IDs 
   are only required to be unique within the corresponding AD scope. 
    
   The resolution infrastructure for flat labels has no ''pay-for-your-
   own'' model, as names are stored at essentially random nodes (See 
   Layered Naming Architecture (LNA) [LNA]). In contrast, the resolution 
   infrastructure for hierarchical host IDs in RANGI has reasonable 
   business model and clear trust boundaries since host IDs can be 
   stored in the corresponding nodes according to their organizational 
   structures. To some extent, the business model of the ID/locator 
   mapping system is similar with that for the Domain Name Service (DNS) 

   In the transition mechanisms for RANGI described in [RANGI-PROXY], 
   the identifiers of RANGI-aware hosts are treated as ordinary IPv6 
   addresses by legacy hosts. When a router receives a packet using a 
   host ID as the destination address, it needs to forward the packet 
   according to the destination IPv6 address as normal. In the end, the 
   packet will be forwarded to a dedicated proxy that is responsible for 
   translating the packets between RANGI and IPv6. Since the identifiers 
   are hierarchical and delegation-oriented aggregatable, such 
   identifier-based routing will not cause any routing scalability issue. 
   For more details, please refer to [RANGI-PROXY]. 

   2.2. Host Locators 

   The host locators in RANGI are ordinary IPv6 addresses. Since the 
   IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition will last for a long period, in 
   order to reduce the deployment cost of this new routing and 
   addressing architecture, RANGI uses specific IPv4-embeded IPv6 
   addresses as locators. As shown in Figure 2, the leftmost 96-bit part 
   of the locator is Locator Domain Identifier (LD ID) while the 
   rightmost 32-bit part is filled with an IPv4 address which is 
   required to be locally unique within the scope of corresponding LD. 
   LD IDs are used to globally identify each autonomous site network 
   which could adopt independent IPv4 address space (either public or 
   private IPv4 addresses). Actually, LD IDs are Provider-Assigned (PA) 
   /96 IPv6 prefixes which are topologically aggregatable in providers' 
   networks.

   Similar with the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol 
   (ISATAP) [RFC5214], this specific locator can be used for 
   automatically tunneling IPv6 packets over the destination IPv4 site 
   networks since the embedded IPv4 address of the destination locator 
   is used as the tunnel destination address directly.  
 
   2.3. Packet Formats 

   RANGI reuse IPv6 protocol stack and packet format to maximum extent. 
   The host ID simply appears as an option in the Destination Option 
   Header, whereas the locator is filled as the IPv6 address in the IPv6 
   header. Packets sent from a RANGI host can be protected by attaching 
   the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the packets 
   with the corresponding private key. The protection works without a 
   certification authority or any security infrastructure.    

   2.4. ID/Locator Mapping Resolution 

   ID/locator split implies a need for storing and distributing the 
   mappings from identifiers to locators. 

   In RANGI, the mappings from Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to 
   identifiers are stored in the DNS system, while the mappings from 
   host IDs to locators are stored in a distributed id/locator mapping 
   system (e.g., a reverse DNS system). In a reverse DNS based mapping 
   infrastructure, if there are too many entries to be maintained by the 
   authoritative server of a given AD, Distribute Hash Table (DHT) 
   technology can be used to scale that authoritative server because the 
   Local Host ID part is a flat label. As a result, the mappings 
   belonging to a given AD will be maintained by a group of DHT peers in 
   a distributed way. As a result, the robustness of DHT is inherited 
   naturally into the ID/Locator mapping system. Meanwhile, there is no 
   trust issue since each of these ADs runs their own DHT ring which 
   only maintains their presidial mappings. 

   A detailed lookup example is given as follows:

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture              July, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   1. A host ID will be transformed to a FQDN format string. Firstly, a 
   host ID is expressed as "country-code.authority-code.region-
   code.local-host-ID" by inserting dots between adjacent fields, then 
   by reversing the fields and attaching with the suffix 
   "RANGI.EXAMPLE." it is transformed into a FQDN-format string "local-
   host-ID.region-code.authority-code.country-code.RANGI.EXAMPLE." 

   2. The FQDN-format string is used as a key to locate the DNS server 
   or the DHT ring maintaining the desired resource records in the 
   reverse DNS infrastructure. If the DHT ring is located, the Local 
   Host ID part SHOULD be used as a key to locate the associated peer in 
   the DHT ring. 

   3. After an authoritative DNS server or a DHT peer has been located, 
   the Local Host ID is used to find out the related entries for that 
   identifier. 

   In order to facilitate such a lookup process, a new sub-domain 
   called ''RANGI.EXAMPLE.'' needs to be inserted into the current domain 
   name space tree structure. This domain can delegate its sub-domains 
   according to the hierarchy of the FQDN-format string of the host ID. 
   A new Resource Record (RR) named RANGI is also defined for the ID-to-
   Loc mappings, in which the NAME field is filled with the FQDN-format 
   string of a host ID, while the RDATA field is filled with the 
   corresponding locator information, including but not limited to an 
   IPv6 address and its preference, and so on.  

   The resolution infrastructure for flat names has no ''pay-for-your-
   own''model, as the flat names are stored at essentially random nodes. 
   In contrast, the resolution infrastructure for the hierarchical host 
   IDs, as used in RANGI, has reasonable business and trust models, 
   because the hierarchical host IDs have clear organization affiliation 
   and the identifier resources can be allocated and managed with clear 
   administrative boundaries. 

   To prevent the Man-in-the-Middle attack during mapping lookups, the 
   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC2065] is strongly recommended 
   for the origin authentication and integrity assurance of the DNS data. 

   The mechanism defined in DNS UPDATE [RFC2136] is directly used for 
   dynamically updating the RRs in the corresponding zone. To support 
   mobility, the TTL of a RANGI RR should be set to 0 or a very small 
   value to prevent a DNS resolver caching antique mapping information. 
   However, if a host (i.e., Correspondence Node) wants to cache the RR 
   of the communicating host (i.e., Mobile Node), it can reset the TTL 
   to a reasonable value internally.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture              July, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   To secure the dynamic update of ID-to-Locator mappings, the mechanism 
   defined in the Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] 
   is used for the purposes of data integrity protection and origin 
   authentication, e.g., the update message is attached with the public 
   key of the update sender and auxiliary parameters, and is signed with 
   the corresponding private key. 

   2.5. Routing and Forwarding System 

   Within RANGI, LDs are connected via Locator Domain Border Routers 
   (LDBRs). A LDBR has at least one locally unique IPv4 address in each 
   LD to which it is connected. The adjacent LDBRs exchange LD ID or LD 
   prefix (Specific LD IDs can be aggregated into one LD prefix) 
   reachability information with an inter-LD routing protocol. In fact, 
   the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for IPv6 address family can be used 
   directly as the inter-LD routing protocol. 

   2.5.1. Host Behavior 

   Generally, a RANGI host needs to obtain the locator of the 
   destination host from the ID/locator mapping system before 
   initializing a communication. If the communication parties share a 
   same LD ID, they can exchange packets directly over an IPv4 tunnel. 
   Otherwise, the traffic will be relayed by LDBRs through IPv4 tunnels. 

   Hosts can get the IPv4 addresses of their local LDBRs in several ways, 
   e.g., a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option, or a 
   well-known LD-scope anycast address specific for LDBRs. 

   2.5.2. LDBR Behavior 

   LDBRs establish BGP sessions among them so as to exchange LD 
   reachability information (i.e., IPv6 routing information with the 
   mask length less than /96). LDBRs forward RANGI packets according to 
   the destination IPv6 addresses (i.e., locators) as normal.  

   2.5.3. Non-LDBR Behavior 

   The non-LDBRs just need to support IPv4 forwarding capability. So 
   there is no need to upgrade them. 

   2.5.4. Forwarding Procedures 

   RANGI introduces a two-level routing mechanism which is composed of 
   LD ID based routing and IPv4 address based routing. The former is

   used for inter-LD routing while the latter is used for intra-LD 
   routing.  

   A simple RANGI routing procedure is illustrated in Figure 3. Host A 
   (as source host) looks up the current locator of host B (as 
   destination host) through the ID/Locator mapping system. After 
   obtaining that information, host A will tunnel the packets with 
   destination address being host B to one of its local LDBRs. The LDBR 
   shall find the next-hop LDBR based on the IPv6 globally routable 
   locator, and forward the packets to it. For the intermediate transit 
   networks, if the Non-LDBR routers which the packets have to traverse 
   are legacy IPv4 routers, the ingress LDBR (for that locator domain) 
   forwards the packet to the egress LDBR of the same locator domain 
   over IPv4 tunnels.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture              July, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   In RANGI, IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels are employed for intra-LD routing 
   between LDBRs (or between LDBRs and hosts). Hence, RANGI can achieve 
   a smooth IPv4/IPv6 transition. Once the internal routers within LDs 
   are upgraded to IPv6, the requirement of IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel 
   between the LDBRs or between LDBRs and hosts will be eliminated and 
   the packets will be delivered by the LDBRs and the internal IPv6 
   routers hop by hop without tunneling as shown in Figure 4.

   2.6. Multi-homing and Traffic-Engineering 

   In RANGI, Each multi-homed stub LD shall be assigned a LD ID by each 
   upstream ISP. In fact, these LD IDs are /96 IPv6 prefixes which are 
   topologically aggregatable in provider networks. Each Host within the 
   multi-homed site, in turn, has multiple locators by concatenating the 
   provider-assigned LD IDs with its locally unique IPv4 address. These 
   hosts register the mappings from their identifiers to locators with 
   the ID/Locator mapping system. As shown in Figure 5, host A which is 
   located in a multi-homed site, has two LD IDs, LD ID_1 and LD ID_2, 
   assigned separately from ISP1 and ISP2. Host A chooses either one as

   the source LD ID of the outgoing packets. Upon receiving the packets, 
   the site exit LDBR, BR1, implements source-based policy routing. For 
   example, if the source LD is LD ID_1, the packets will be forwarded 
   to the ISP1's network, otherwise, they will be forwarded to ISP2's 
   network.

   The site-controlled traffic-engineering works as follows: 

   1) The source host sends out packets with the source LD ID being one 
      of its LD IDs (assuming LD ID 1 being used). 

   2) The packets are intercepted by the LDBR BR1, and according to the 
      traffic-engineering policy, the source LD IDs of the packets may

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture              July, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

      be re-written from LD ID_1 to LD ID_2. Then BR1 forwards the 
      packets into ISP2's network according to source-based routing 
      policies. 

   3) Once the packets arrive at the destination host, that host will 
      use the source LD IDs in the received packets as the destination 
      LD IDs in the response packets. So the response packets will also 
      enter site A through ISP2's network.  

   4) The source host could accept this change and use LD ID 2 as source 
      LD ID in the subsequent packets. 

   Similar to the GSE [GSE], the site-controlled traffic-engineering by 
   rewriting the source LD ID will have effect on the path (upstream ISP) 
   selection for both the outgoing packets and the incoming packets. In 
   addition, the multi-homing and traffic-engineering usages in RANGI 
   will not cause any routing scalability issue.  

   2.7. Mobility 

   In RANGI, when a host physically moves from one attachment to another, 
   its host ID remains unchanged. The host needs to register the new 
   locator with the ID/locator mapping system. Meanwhile, it should 
   notify the corresponding entity of its new locator as soon as 
   possible. 

3. Summary 

   RANGI achieves almost all of goals set by RRG, which are listed as 
   follows: 

   1) Routing Scalability: Scalability is achieved by separating 
      identifiers from locators. Global routing is done based on 
      provider assigned locators. 

   2) Traffic Engineering: Site border router can overwrite the source 
      locator of the outgoing packets before performing source-based 
      policy routing. That is to say, hosts located in a multi-homed 
      site can suggest the upstream ISP for outbound and inbound 
      traffics, while the first-hop LDBR (i.e., site border router) has 
      the final decision right on the upstream ISP selection. 

   3) Mobility and Multi-homing: Applications and transport layers are 
      bound to host IDs and so the sessions will not be interrupted due 
      to locator change in cases of mobility or multi-homing.

                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   4) Simplified Renumbering: When changing providers, the local IPv4       
      addresses of the site do not need to change.  Hence the internal        
      routers within the site don't need renumbering. 

   5) Decoupling Location and Identifier: Obvious. 

   6) Routing Quality: Since LDBRs only exchange LD reachability and the 
      topology within LD will not be disclosed outside, the routing 
      stability is improved significantly. 

   7) Routing Security: RANGI reuses existing routing system and does 
      not introduce any new security risk into the routing system. 

   8) Incremental Deployability: the non-LDBRs within a LD can still be 
      IPv4-only. RANGI allows easy transition from IPv4 networks to IPv6 
      networks. In addition, the transition mechanisms for RANGI defined 
      in [RANGI-PROXY] allow RANGI hosts to communicate with the legacy 
      IPv4 or IPv6 hosts, and vice versa.  

4. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   A specific prefix for host IDs needs to be assigned from the IPv6 
   address space. 

   Two new options in the Destination Option Header need to be assigned 
   for the host ID and its corresponding parameter date structure 
   respectively.
