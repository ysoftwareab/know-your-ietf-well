                      for Segment Routing Networks
                    draft-gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm-05

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is
   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6
   (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies procedure for sending
   and processing probe query and response messages for Performance
   Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the
   mechanisms defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
   (TWAMP) Light) and Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
   for Delay Measurement, and also uses the mechanisms defined in this
   document for Loss Measurement.  The procedure specified is applicable
   to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and are used for both links and
   end-to-end SR Policies.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  SR takes advantage of the
   Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] are used
   to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack
   of Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks using probe messages.  These protocols rely on
   control-channel signaling to establish a test-channel over an UDP
   path.  These protocols lack support for direct-mode Loss Measurement
   (LM) to detect actual data traffic loss which is required in SR
   networks.  The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
   [I-D.ippm-stamp] alleviates the control-channel signaling by using
   configuration data model to provision a test-channel.  The TWAMP
   Light [Appendix I in RFC5357] [BBF.TR-390] provides simplified
   mechanisms for active performance measurement in Customer IP networks
   by provisioning UDP paths and eliminates the control-channel
   signaling.

   This document specifies procedures for sending and processing probe
   query and response messages for Performance Measurement in SR
   networks.  The procedure uses the mechanisms defined in [RFC5357]
   (TWAMP Light) and STAMP for Delay Measurement (DM), and also uses the
   mechanisms defined in this document for Loss Measurement.  The
   procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and
   are used for both links and end-to-end SR Policies.  This document
   also defines mechanisms for handling ECMPs of SR Policies for
   performance delay measurements.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the sender node R1 initiates a
   probe query for performance measurement and the reflector node R5
   sends a probe response for the query message received.  The probe
   response is sent to the sender node R1.  The nodes R1 and R5 may be
   directly connected via a link enabled with Segment Routing or there
   exists a Point-to-Point (P2P) SR Policy
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] on node R1 with destination to
   node R5.  In case of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), SR Policy
   originating from source node R1 may terminate on multiple destination
   leaf nodes [I-D.spring-sr-p2mp-policy].

3.  Overview

   For one-way, two-way and round-trip delay measurements in Segment
   Routing networks, the TWAMP Light procedures defined in Appendix I of
   [RFC5357] are used.  For one-way and two-way direct-mode and
   inferred-mode loss measurements in Segment Routing networks, the
   procedures defined in this document are used.  One-way loss
   measurement provides receive packet loss whereas two-way loss
   measurement provides both transmit and receive packet loss.  Separate
   UDP destination port numbers are user-configured for delay and loss
   measurements from the range specified in [I-D.ippm-stamp].  The
   sender uses the UDP port number following the guidelines specified in
   Section 6 in [RFC6335].  For both links and end-to-end SR Policies,
   no PM session for delay or loss measurement is created on the
   reflector node R5 [RFC5357].  

   For Performance Measurement, probe query and response messages are
   sent as following:

   o  For Delay Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the
      congruent path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are

      used to measure the delay experienced by the actual data traffic
      flowing on the links and SR Policies.

   o  For Loss Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the congruent
      path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are used to
      collect the receive traffic counters for the incoming link or
      incoming SID where the probe query messages are received at the
      reflector node (incoming link or incoming SID needed since the
      reflector node does not have PM session state present).


   The In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   mechanisms for SR-MPLS defined in [I-D.spring-ioam-sr-mpls] and for
   SRv6 defined in [I-D.spring-ioam-srv6] are used to carry PM
   information such as timestamp in-band as part of the data packets,
   and are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Example Provisioning Model

   An example of a provisioning model and typical measurement parameters
   for performance delay and loss measurements is shown in the following
   Figure:

                      Sender              Reflector

                       Example Provisioning Model 

   The reflector node R5 uses the parameters for the timestamp format,
   delay measurement mode (i.e. one-way, two-way or loopback mode) and
   packet padding size from the received probe query message.

   Examples of Measurement Protocol is TWAMP Light or STAMP,  the
   Timestamp Format is PTPv2 [IEEE1588] or NTP and the Loss Measurement
   mode is inferred or direct mode.  The mechanisms to provision the
   sender and reflector nodes are outside the scope of this document.

3.2.  STAMP Applicability

   The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
   [I-D.ippm-stamp] and the STAMP TLVs [I-D.ippm-stamp-option-tlv] are
   both equally applicable to the procedures specified in this document.
    This is because the delay measurement message formats defined for
   STAMP and STAMP TLVs are backwards compatible with the delay
   measurement message formats defined in [RFC5357].  Hence, the same
   user-configured destination UDP port for delay measurement can be
   used for STAMP and TWAMP Light messages.  The STAMP with a TLV for
   "direct measurement" can be used for combined delay + loss
   measurement using a separate user-configured UDP destination port.

   The loss measurement probe and query messages defined in this
   document are also equally applicable to STAMP and STAMP TLVs, and use
   the message formats defined in [I-D.ippm-stamp].


4.  Probe Messages

4.1.  Probe Query Message

   In this document, the probe messages defined in [RFC5357] are used
   for Delay and Loss measurements for SR links and end-to-end SR
   Policies.  The user-configured destination UDP ports (separate UDP
   ports for different delay and loss message formats) are used for
   identifying the PM probe packets as described in Appendix I of
   [RFC5357].

   The Sender IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the source address.  When
   known, the reflector IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the destination
   address.  If not known, the address in the range of 127/8 for IPv4 or
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6 is used as destination address. 
   This is the case for example, when using SR Policy with IPv4 endpoint
   of 0.0.0.0 or IPv6 endpoint of ::0
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy].

4.1.1.  Delay Measurement Probe Query Message

   The message content for Delay Measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC768] is shown in Figure 1.  The DM probe query message
   is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for DM.  The
   Destination UDP port cannot be used as Source port, since the message

Internet-Draft      TWAMP Light for Segment Routing     December 5, 2019


   does not have any indication to distinguish between query and
   response.  The DM probe query message contains the payload for delay
   measurement defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5357].  For symmetrical
   size query and response messages [RFC6038], the DM probe query
   message contains the payload format defined in Section 4.2.1 of
   [RFC5357].

       been sent over a bidirectional path and the response is required
       over the same path in the reverse direction.

   Timestamp field is eight bytes and use the format defined in Section
   4.2.1 of [RFC5357].  It is recommended to use the IEEE 1588v2
   Precision Time Protocol (PTP) truncated 64-bit timestamp format
   [IEEE1588] as specified in [RFC8186], preferred with hardware support
   in Segment Routing networks.

   When using the authenticated mode for delay measurement, the matching
   authentication type (e.g. HMAC-SHA-256) and key are user-configured
   on both the sender and reflector nodes.  A separate user-configured
   destination UDP port is used for the delay measurement in
   authentication mode due to the different probe message format. 

4.1.2.  Loss Measurement Probe Query Message

   In this document, new probe query message formats are defined for
   loss measurement as shown in Figure 3A and Figure 3B.  The message
   formats are hardware efficient due to the small size payload and
   well-known locations of counters.  They are similar to the delay
   measurement message formats and do not require any backwards
   compatibility and support for the existing DM message formats from
   [RFC5357].

   The message content for Loss Measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC768] is shown in Figure 2.  The LM probe query message
   is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for LM. 
   Separate Destination UDP ports are used for direct-mode and
   inferred-mode loss measurements.  The Destination UDP port cannot be
   used as Source port, since the message does not have any indication
   to distinguish between query and response.  The LM probe query
   message contains the payload for loss measurement as defined in
   Figure 3A-3D.

    Figure 3D: STAMP LM Probe Query Message Format - Authenticated Mode


   Sequence Number (32-bit): As defined in [RFC5357].

   Transmit Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets sent by
   the sender node in the query message and by the reflector node in the
   response message.  The counter is always written at the fixed
   location in the probe query and response messages.

   Receive Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets received at
   the reflector node.  It is written by the reflector node in the probe
   response message.

   Sender Counter (64-bit): This is the exact copy of the transmit
   counter from the received query message.  It is written by the
   reflector node in the probe response message.

   Sender Sequence Number (32-bit): As defined in [RFC5357].

   Sender TTL: As defined in [RFC5357].

   LM Flags: The meanings of the Flag bits are:

      X: Extended counter format indicator.  Indicates the use of
      extended (64-bit) counter values.  Initialized to 1 upon creation
      (and prior to transmission) of an LM Query and copied from an LM
      Query to an LM response.  Set to 0 when the LM message is
      transmitted or received over an interface that writes 32-bit
      counter values.

      B: Octet (byte) count.  When set to 1, indicates that the Counter
      1-4 fields represent octet counts.  The octet count applies to all
      packets within the LM scope, and the octet count of a packet sent
      or received includes the total length of that packet (but excludes
      headers, labels, or framing of the channel itself).  When set to
      0, indicates that the Counter fields represent packet counts.

   Block Number (8-bit): The Loss Measurement using Alternate-Marking
   method defined in [RFC8321] requires to color the data traffic.  To
   be able to compare the transmit and receive traffic counters of the
   matching color,  the Block Number (or color) of the traffic counters
   is carried by the probe query and response messages for loss
   measurement.

   HMAC: The PM probe packet in authenticated mode includes a key Hashed
   Message Authentication Code (HMAC) ([RFC2104]) hash.  Each probe
   query and response messages are authenticated by adding Sequence
   Number with Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) TLV.  It can
   use HMAC-SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits (similarly to the use of it in
   IPSec defined in [RFC4868]); hence the length of the HMAC field is 16
   octets.  

   HMAC uses its own key and the mechanism to distribute the HMAC key is
   outside the scope of this document.

   In authenticated mode, only the sequence number is encrypted, and the
   other payload fields are sent in clear text.  The probe packet MAY
   include Comp.MBZ (Must Be Zero) variable length field to align the
   packet on 16 octets boundary.

4.1.2.1.  Loss Measurement Authentication Mode

   When using the authenticated mode for loss measurement, the matching
   authentication type (e.g. HMAC-SHA-256) and key are user-configured
   on both the sender and reflector nodes.  A separate user-configured
   destination UDP port is used for the loss measurement in
   authentication mode due to the different message format. 

4.1.3.  Probe Query for SR Links

   The probe query message as defined in Figure 1 is sent on the
   congruent path of the data traffic for Delay measurement.  The probe
   query message as defined in Figure 2 is sent on the congruent path of
   the data traffic for Loss measurement.

              Figure 5: Probe Query Message for SRv6 Policy

   For delay measurement of SRv6 Policy using SRH, END function END.OTP
   [I-D.6man-srv6-oam] is used with the target SRv6 SID to punt probe
   messages on the target node, as shown in Figure 5.  Similarly, for
   loss measurement of SRv6 Policy, END function END.OP
   [I-D.6man-srv6-oam] is used with target SRv6 SID to punt probe
   messages on the target node.

4.2.  Probe Response Message

   The probe response message is sent using the IP/UDP information from
   the received probe query message.  The content of the probe response
   message is shown in Figure 6.

                     Figure 6: Probe Response Message


   In this document, probe response message formats are defined for loss
   measurement as shown in Figure 7A-7D.  The message formats are
   hardware efficient due to the small size payload and well known
   locations of the counters.  They are also similar to the delay
   measurement message formats.

4.2.1.  One-way Measurement Mode

   In one-way performance measurement mode, the probe response message
   as defined in Figure 6 is sent back out-of-band to the sender node,
   for both SR links and SR Policies.  The Control Code is set to
   "Out-of-band Response Requested".

4.2.2.  Two-way Measurement Mode

   In two-way performance measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   path, the probe response message as defined in Figure 6 is sent back
   to the sender node on the congruent path of the data traffic on the
   same reverse direction SR Link or associated reverse SR Policy
   [I-D.bidir-sr].  The Control Code is set to "In-band Response
   Requested".

4.2.3.  Loopback Measurement Mode

   The Loopback measurement mode can be used to measure round-trip delay
   for a bidirectional SR Path.  The IP header of the probe query
   message contains the destination address equals to the sender address
   and the source address equals to the reflector address.  Optionally,
   the probe query message can carry the reverse path information (e.g.
   reverse path label stack for SR-MPLS) as part of the SR header.  The
   reflector node does not process the PM probe messages and generate
   response messages.

4.3.  Return Path TLV

   For two-way performance measurement, the reflector node needs to send
   the probe response message on a specific reverse path.  The sender
   node can request in the probe query message to the reflector node to
   send a response back on a given reverse path (e.g. co-routed
   bidirectional path).  This way the destination node does not require
   any additional SR Policy state.

   For one-way performance measurement, the sender node address may not
   be reachable via IP route from the reflector node.  The sender node
   in this case needs to send its reachability path information to the
   reflector node.

   [I-D.ippm-stamp-option-tlv] defines STAMP probe query messages that
   can include one or more optional TLVs.  The TLV Type (TBA1) is
   defined in this document for Return Path to carry reverse path for
   probe response messages (in the payload of the message).  The format
   of the Return Path TLV is shown in Figure 8A and Figure 8B:

           Figure 8B: Segment List Sub-TLV in Return Path TLV


   The Segment List Sub-TLV (shown in Figure 8B) in the Return Path TLV
   can be one of the following Types:


   o  Type (value 1): SR-MPLS Label Stack of the Reverse SR Path

   o  Type (value 2): SR-MPLS Binding SID [I-D.pce-binding-label-sid] of
      the Reverse SR Policy

   o  Type (value 3): SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Path

   o  Type (value 4): SRv6 Binding SID [I-D.pce-binding-label-sid] of
      the Reverse SR Policy


   The Return Path TLV is optional.  The PM sender node MUST only insert
   one Return Path TLV in the probe query message and the reflector node
   MUST only process the first Return Path TLV in the probe query
   message and ignore other Return Path TLVs if present.  The reflector
   node MUST send probe response message back on the reverse path
   specified in the Return Path TLV and MUST NOT add Return Path TLV in
   the probe response message.  

   In the absence of Return Path TLV, in two-way measurement mode, the
   probe response message is sent back on the incoming physical
   interface where the probe query message is received.  This is useful
   for example, in case of two-way measurement mode for SR link delay.

4.4.  Node Address TLV

   The Node Address TLV has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

                   Figure 12: Node Address TLV Format

   The Address Family field indicates the type of the address, and it
   SHALL be set to one of the assigned values in the "IANA Address
   Family Numbers" registry.

   The Node Address TLV is of the following Type: Destination Node
   Address.

   The Destination Node Address TLV is optional.  The Destination Node
   Address TLV indicates the address of the intended recipient of the
   probe message.  The destination node SHOULD NOT send response if it
   is not the intended destination node of the prone query message. 
   This check is useful for example, for performance measurement of SR
   Policy when using the destination address in 127/8 range for IPv4 or
   in 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6.


5.  Performance Measurement for P2MP SR Policies

   The procedures for delay and loss measurement described in this
   document for Point-to-Point (P2P) SR Policies
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] are also equally applicable to
   the Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR Policies
   [I-D.spring-sr-p2mp-policy] as following:

   o  The sender root node sends probe query messages using the
      Replication Segment defined in [I-D.spring-sr-p2mp-policy] for the
      P2MP SR Policy as shown in Figure 11.

   o  Each reflector leaf node sends its IP address in the Source
      Address of the probe response messages as shown in Figure 6.  This
      allows the sender root node to identify the reflector leaf nodes
      of the P2MP SR Policy.

   o  The P2MP root node measures the end-to-end delay and loss
      performance for each P2MP leaf node of the P2MP SR Policy.

         Figure 11: With Replication Segment for SR-MPLS Policy


6.  ECMP Support for SR Policies

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes. 
   Usage of Anycast SID [RFC8402] by an SR Policy can result in ECMP
   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The PM probe
   messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   performance delay of an SR Policy.  

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  The mechanisms described in
   [RFC8029] and [RFC5884] for handling ECMPs are also applicable to the
   performance measurement.  In the IP header of the PM probe messages,
   sweeping of Destination Addresses in 127/8 range for IPv4 or
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6 can be used to exercise a
   particular ECMP path.  As specified in [RFC6437], Flow Label field in
   the IPv6 header can also be used for sweeping.

   The considerations for performance loss measurement for different
   ECMP paths of an SR Policy are outside the scope of this document.


7.  Additional Message Processing Rules

7.1.  TTL Value

   The TTL or the Hop Limit field in the IP, MPLS and SRH headers of the
   probe query messages are set to 255 [RFC5357].

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range, the TTL
   in the IPv4 header is set to 1 [RFC8029].  Similarly, when using the
   Destination IPv6 Address from the 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range, the
   Hop Limit field in the inner IPv6 header is set to 1 whereas in the
   outer IPv6 header is set to 255.

7.2.  Router Alert Option

   The Router Alert IP option is not set when using the routable
   Destination IP Address in the probe messages.

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range, to be
   able to punt probe packets on the reflector node, the Router Alert IP
   Option of value 0x0 [RFC2113] for IPv4 MAY be added [RFC8029]. 
   Similarly, when using the Destination IPv6 Address from the
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range, the Router Alert IP Option of value 69
 


Gandhi, et al.            Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft      TWAMP Light for Segment Routing     December 5, 2019


   [RFC7506] for IPv6 MAY be added in the destination option.  For SRv6
   Policy using SRH, it is added in the inner IPv6 header.

7.3.  UDP Checksum

   The Checksum Complement for delay and loss measurement messages
   follows the procedure defined in [RFC7820] and can be optionally used
   with the procedures defined in this document.

   For IPv4 and IPv6 probe messages, where the hardware is not capable
   of re-computing the UDP checksum or adding checksum complement
   [RFC7820], the sender node sets the UDP checksum to 0 [RFC6936]
   [RFC8085].  The receiving node bypasses the checksum validation and
   accepts the packets with UDP checksum value 0 for the UDP port being
   used for PM delay and loss measurements.


8.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in
   well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a measurement operation has
   previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the
   far-end reflector node.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or timestamp fields
   in received measurement response messages.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the probe messages.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH [I-D.6man-segment-routing-header]. 
   Hence, PM probe messages for SRv6 may not need authentication mode. 
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access-control lists and firewalls.


9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value for the following optional
   Return Path TLV Type for [I-D.ippm-stamp-option-tlv] to be carried in
   PM probe query messages:

      o  Type TBA1: Return Path TLV

   IANA is also requested to allocate the values for the following
   Sub-TLV Types for the Return Path TLV.

      o  Type (value 0): Return Address

      o  Type (value 1): SR-MPLS Label Stack of the Reverse SR Path

      o  Type (value 2): SR-MPLS Binding SID [I-D.pce-binding-label-sid]
                         of the Reverse SR Policy

      o  Type (value 3): SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Path

      o  Type (value 4): SRv6 Binding SID [I-D.pce-binding-label-sid] of
                         the Reverse SR Policy


   IANA is requested to allocate a value for the following optional
   Destination Address TLV Type for [I-D.ippm-stamp-option-tlv] to be
   carried in PM probe message:

      o  Type TBA2: Destination Address TLV
