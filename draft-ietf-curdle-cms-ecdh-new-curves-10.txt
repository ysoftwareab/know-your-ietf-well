1.  Introduction

   This document describes the conventions for using Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement using curve25519 and curve448
   [CURVES] in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS].  Key
   agreement is supported in three CMS content types: the enveloped-data
   content type [CMS], authenticated-data content type [CMS], and the
   authenticated-enveloped-data content type [AUTHENV].

   The conventions for using some Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
   algorithms in CMS are described in [CMSECC].  These conventions cover
   the use of ECDH with some curves other than curve25519 and curve448
   [CURVES].  Those other curves are not deprecated.

   Using curve25519 with Diffie-Hellman key agreement is referred to as
   X25519.  Using curve448 with Diffie-Hellman key agreement is referred
   to as X448.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [STDWORDS].

1.2.  ASN.1

   CMS values are generated using ASN.1 [X680], which uses the Basic
   Encoding Rules (BER) and the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
   [X690].

2.  Key Agreement

   In 1976, Diffie and Hellman described a means for two parties to
   agree upon a shared secret value in manner that prevents
   eavesdroppers from learning the shared secret value [DH1976].  This
   secret may then be converted into pairwise symmetric keying material
   for use with other cryptographic algorithms.  Over the years, many
   variants of this fundamental technique have been developed.  This
   document describes the conventions for using Ephemeral-Static
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement using X25519 and
   X448 [CURVES].

   The originator MUST use an ephemeral public/private key pair that is
   generated on the same elliptic curve as the public key of the
   recipient.  The ephemeral key pair MUST be used for a single CMS
   protected content type, and then it MUST be discarded.  The
   originator obtains the recipient's static public key from the
   recipient's certificate [PROFILE].

   X25519 is described in Section 6.1 of [CURVES], and X448 is described
   in Section 6.2 of [CURVES].  Conforming implementations MUST check
   whether the computed Diffie-Hellman shared secret is the all-zero
   value, and abort if so, as described in Section 6 of [CURVES].  If an
   alternative implementation of these elliptic curves to that
   documented in Section 6 of [CURVES] is employed, then the additional
   checks specified in Section 7 of [CURVES] SHOULD be performed.

   In [CURVES], the shared secret value that is produced by ECDH is
   called K.  (In some other specifications, the shared secret value is
   called Z.)  A key derivation function (KDF) is used to produce a
   pairwise key-encryption key (KEK) from the shared secret value (K),
   the length of the key-encryption key, and the DER-encoded ECC-CMS-
   SharedInfo structure [CMSECC].

   The ECC-CMS-SharedInfo definition from [CMSECC] is repeated here for
   convenience.

      ECC-CMS-SharedInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        keyInfo         AlgorithmIdentifier,
        entityUInfo [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
        suppPubInfo [2] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING  }

   The ECC-CMS-SharedInfo keyInfo field contains the object identifier
   of the key-encryption algorithm and associated parameters.  This
   algorithm will be used to wrap the content-encryption key.  For
   example, the AES Key Wrap algorithm [AESKW] does not need parameters,
   so the algorithm identifier parameters are absent.

   The ECC-CMS-SharedInfo entityUInfo field optionally contains
   additional keying material supplied by the sending agent.  Note that
   [CMS] requires implementations to accept a KeyAgreeRecipientInfo
   SEQUENCE that includes the ukm field.  If the ukm field is present,
   the ukm is placed in the entityUInfo field.  By including the ukm, a
   different key-encryption key is generated even when the originator
   ephemeral private key is improperly used more than once.  Therefore,
   if the ukm field is present, it MUST be selected in a manner that
   provides with very high probability a unique value; however, there is
   no security benefit to using a ukm value that is longer than the key-
   encryption key that will be produced by the KDF.

   The ECC-CMS-SharedInfo suppPubInfo field contains the length of the
   generated key-encryption key, in bits, represented as a 32-bit number
   in network byte order.  For example, the key length for AES-256 [AES]
   would be 0x00000100.

2.1.  ANSI-X9.63-KDF

   The ANSI-X9.63-KDF key derivation function is a simple construct
   based on a one-way hash function described in American National
   Standard X9.63 [X963].  This KDF is also described in Section 3.6.1
   of [SEC1].

   Three values are concatenated to produce the input string to the KDF:
      1. The shared secret value generated by ECDH, K.
      2. The iteration counter, starting with one, as described below.
      3. The DER-encoded ECC-CMS-SharedInfo structure.

   To generate a key-encryption key (KEK), the KDF generates one or more
   KM blocks, with the counter starting at 0x00000001, and incrementing
   the counter for each subsequent KM block until enough material has
   been generated.  The 32-bit counter is represented in network byte
   order.  The KM blocks are concatenated left to right, and then the

Internet-Draft                                               August 2017


   leftmost portion of the result is used as the pairwise key-encryption
   key, KEK:

      KM(i) = Hash(K || INT32(counter=i) || DER(ECC-CMS-SharedInfo))

      KEK = KM(counter=1) || KM(counter=2) ...

2.2.  HKDF

   The HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is a
   robust construct based on a one-way hash function described in RFC
   5869 [HKDF].  HKDF is comprised of two steps: HKDF-Extract followed
   by HKDF-Expand.

   Three values are used as inputs to the HKDF:
      1. The shared secret value generated by ECDH, K.
      2. The length in octets of the keying data to be generated.
      3. The DER-encoded ECC-CMS-SharedInfo structure.

   The ECC-CMS-SharedInfo structure optionally includes the ukm.  If the
   ukm is present, the ukm is also used as the HKDF salt.  HKDF uses an
   appropriate number of zero octets when no salt is provided.

   The length of the generated key-encryption key is used in two places,
   once in bits, and once in octets.  The ECC-CMS-SharedInfo structure
   includes the length of the generated key-encryption key in bits.  The
   HKDF-Expand function takes an argument for the length of the
   generated key-encryption key in octets.

   In summary, to produce the pairwise key-encryption key, KEK:

      if ukm is provided, then salt = ukm, else salt is not provided
      PRK = HKDF-Extract(salt, K)

      KEK = HKDF-Expand(PRK, DER(ECC-CMS-SharedInfo), SizeInOctets(KEK))

3. Enveloped-data Conventions

   The CMS enveloped-data content type [CMS] consists of an encrypted
   content and wrapped content-encryption keys for one or more
   recipients.  The ECDH key agreement algorithm is used to generate a
   pairwise key-encryption key between the originator and a particular
   recipient.  Then, the key-encryption key is used to wrap the content-
   encryption key for that recipient.  When there is more than one
   recipient, the same content-encryption key MUST be wrapped for each
   of them.

Internet-Draft                                               August 2017


   A compliant implementation MUST meet the requirements for
   constructing an enveloped-data content type in Section 6 of [CMS].

   A content-encryption key MUST be randomly generated for each instance
   of an enveloped-data content type.  The content-encryption key is
   used to encrypt the content.

3.1.  EnvelopedData Fields

   The enveloped-data content type is ASN.1 encoded using the
   EnvelopedData syntax.  The fields of the EnvelopedData syntax MUST be
   populated as described in Section 6 of [CMS].  The RecipientInfo
   choice is described in Section 6.2 of [CMS], and repeated here for
   convenience.

      RecipientInfo ::= CHOICE {
        ktri KeyTransRecipientInfo,
        kari [1] KeyAgreeRecipientInfo,
        kekri [2] KEKRecipientInfo,
        pwri [3] PasswordRecipientinfo,
        ori [4] OtherRecipientInfo }

   For the recipients that use X25519 or X448 the RecipientInfo kari
   choice MUST be used.

3.2. KeyAgreeRecipientInfo Fields

   The fields of the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo syntax MUST be populated as
   described in this section when X25519 or X448 is employed for one or
   more recipients.

   The KeyAgreeRecipientInfo version MUST be 3.

   The KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator provides three alternatives for
   identifying the originator's public key, and the originatorKey
   alternative MUST be used.  The originatorKey MUST contain an
   ephemeral key for the originator.  The originatorKey algorithm field
   MUST contain the id-X25519 or the id-X448 object identifier.  The
   originator's ephemeral public key MUST be encoded as an OCTET STRING.

   The object identifiers for X25519 and X448 have been assigned in
   [ID.curdle-pkix].  They are repeated below for convenience.

Internet-Draft                                               August 2017


   When using X25519, the public key contains exactly 32 octets, and the
   id-X25519 object identifier is used:

      id-X25519 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 110 }

   When using X448, the public key contains exactly 56 octets, and the
   id-X448 object identifier is used:

      id-X448 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 111 }

   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo ukm is optional.  The processing of the ukm
   with The ANSI-X9.63-KDF key derivation function is described in
   Section 2.1, and the processing of the ukm with the HKDF key
   derivation function is described in Section 2.2.

   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo keyEncryptionAlgorithm MUST contain the object
   identifier of the key-encryption algorithm that will be used to wrap
   the content-encryption key.  The conventions for using AES-128,
   AES-192, and AES-256 in the key wrap mode are specified in [CMSAES].

   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo recipientEncryptedKeys includes a recipient
   identifier and encrypted key for one or more recipients.  The
   RecipientEncryptedKey KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier MUST contain either
   the issuerAndSerialNumber identifying the recipient's certificate or
   the RecipientKeyIdentifier containing the subject key identifier from
   the recipient's certificate.  In both cases, the recipient's
   certificate contains the recipient's static X25519 or X448 public
   key.  RecipientEncryptedKey EncryptedKey MUST contain the content-
   encryption key encrypted with the pairwise key-encryption key using
   the algorithm specified by the KeyWrapAlgorithm.

4.  Authenticated-data Conventions

   The CMS authenticated-data content type [CMS] consists an
   authenticated content, a message authentication code (MAC), and
   encrypted authentication keys for one or more recipients.  The ECDH
   key agreement algorithm is used to generate a pairwise key-encryption
   key between the originator and a particular recipient.  Then, the
   key-encryption key is used to wrap the authentication key for that
   recipient.  When there is more than one recipient, the same
   authentication key MUST be wrapped for each of them.

   A compliant implementation MUST meet the requirements for
   constructing an authenticated-data content type in Section 9 of
   [CMS].

Internet-Draft                                               August 2017


   A authentication key MUST be randomly generated for each instance of
   an authenticated-data content type.  The authentication key is used
   to compute the MAC over the content.

4.1.  AuthenticatedData Fields

   The authenticated-data content type is ASN.1 encoded using the
   AuthenticatedData syntax.  The fields of the AuthenticatedData syntax
   MUST be populated as described in [CMS]; for the recipients that use
   X25519 or X448 the RecipientInfo kari choice MUST be used.

4.2.  KeyAgreeRecipientInfo Fields

   The fields of the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo syntax MUST be populated as
   described in Section 3.2 of this document.

5.  Authenticated-Enveloped-data Conventions

   The CMS authenticated-enveloped-data content type [AUTHENV] consists
   of an authenticated and encrypted content and encrypted content-
   authenticated-encryption keys for one or more recipients.  The ECDH
   key agreement algorithm is used to generate a pairwise key-encryption
   key between the originator and a particular recipient.  Then, the
   key-encryption key is used to wrap the content-authenticated-
   encryption key for that recipient.  When there is more than one
   recipient, the same content-authenticated-encryption key MUST be
   wrapped for each of them.

   A compliant implementation MUST meet the requirements for
   constructing an authenticated-data content type in Section 2 of
   [AUTHENV].

   A content-authenticated-encryption key MUST be randomly generated for
   each instance of an authenticated-enveloped-data content type.  The
   content-authenticated-encryption key is used to authenticate and
   encrypt the content.

5.1.  AuthEnvelopedData Fields

   The authenticated-enveloped-data content type is ASN.1 encoded using
   the AuthEnvelopedData syntax.  The fields of the AuthEnvelopedData
   syntax MUST be populated as described in [AUTHENV]; for the
   recipients that use X25519 or X448 the RecipientInfo kari choice MUST
   be used.

5.2.  KeyAgreeRecipientInfo Fields

   The fields of the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo syntax MUST be populated as
   described in Section 3.2 of this document.

6.  Certificate Conventions

   RFC 5280 [PROFILE] specifies the profile for using X.509 Certificates
   in Internet applications.  A recipient static public key is needed
   for X25519 or X448, and the originator obtains that public key from
   the recipient's certificate.  The conventions for carrying X25519 and
   X448 public keys are specified in [ID.curdle-pkix].

7.  Key Agreement Algorithm Identifiers

   The following object identifiers are assigned in [CMSECC] to indicate
   ECDH with ANSI-X9.63-KDF using various one-way hash functions.  These
   are expected to be used as AlgorithmIdentifiers with a parameter that
   specifies the key-encryption algorithm.  These are repeated here for
   convenience.

      secg-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
        iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) schemes(1) }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha256kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
        secg-scheme 11 1 }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha384kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
        secg-scheme 11 2 }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha512kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
        secg-scheme 11 3 }

   The following object identifiers are assigned to indicate ECDH with
   HKDF using various one-way hash functions.  These are expected to be
   used as AlgorithmIdentifiers with a parameter that specifies the
   key-encryption algorithm.

      smime-alg OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) alg(3) }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-hkdf-sha256-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         smime-alg 19 }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-hkdf-sha384-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         smime-alg 20 }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-hkdf-sha512-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         smime-alg 21 }

8.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute Conventions

   A sending agent MAY announce to other agents that it supports ECDH
   key agreement using the SMIMECapabilities signed attribute in a
   signed message [SMIME] or a certificate [CERTCAP].  Following the
   pattern established in [CMSECC], the SMIMECapabilities associated
   with ECDH carries a DER-encoded object identifier that identifies
   support for ECDH in conjunction with a particular KDF, and it
   includes a parameter that names the key wrap algorithm.

   The following SMIMECapabilities values (in hexidecimal) from [CMSECC]
   might be of interest to implementations that support X25519 and X448:

      ECDH with ANSI-X9.63-KDF using SHA-256; uses AES-128 key wrap:

9.  Security Considerations

   Please consult the security considerations of [CMS] for security
   considerations related to the enveloped-data content type and the
   authenticated-data content type.

   Please consult the security considerations of [AUTHENV] for security
   considerations related to the authenticated-enveloped-data content
   type.

   Please consult the security considerations of [CURVES] for security
   considerations related to the use of X25519 and X448.

   The originator uses an ephemeral public/private key pair that is
   generated on the same elliptic curve as the public key of the
   recipient.  The ephemeral key pair is used for a single CMS protected
   content type, and then it is discarded.  If the originator wants to
   be able to decrypt the content (for enveloped-data and authenticated-
   enveloped-data) or check the authentication (for authenticated-data),
   then the originator needs to treat themselves as a recipient.

   As specified in [CMS], implementations MUST support processing of the
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo ukm field; this ensures that interoperability
   is not a concern whether the ukm is present or absent.  The ukm is
   placed in the entityUInfo field of the ECC-CMS-SharedInfo structure.
   When present, the ukm ensures that a different key-encryption key is
   generated, even when the originator ephemeral private key is
   improperly used more than once.

10.  IANA Considerations

   One object identifier for the ASN.1 module in the Appendix was
   assigned in the SMI Security for S/MIME Module Identifiers
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.0) [IANA-MOD] registry:

      id-mod-cms-ecdh-alg-2017 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) mod(0) 67 }

   Three object identifiers for the Key Agreement Algorithm Identifiers
   in Sections 7 were assigned in the SMI Security for S/MIME Algorithms
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.3) [IANA-ALG] registry:

      smime-alg OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) alg(3) }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-hkdf-sha256-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         smime-alg 19 }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-hkdf-sha384-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         smime-alg 20 }

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-hkdf-sha512-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
