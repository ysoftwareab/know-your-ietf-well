Abstract

IANA has defined an "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the
"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling
Parameters" registry. This document updates the OTN Signal Type
subregistry specified in RFC 7139 to allow Specification Required
policies, as defined in RFC 5226.

1. Introduction

   IANA maintains "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters"
   registry for the OTN signal defined in [RFC4328] and updated by
   [RFC7139]. This subregistry is defined to use only the Standards
   Action registration policy as defined by [RFC5226]. This
   document updates [RFC7139] to allow the "OTN Signal Type"
   subregistry to also support Specification Required policies, as
   defined in [RFC5226].

2. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations
   to the existing GMPLS signaling protocols.  Refer to [RFC7139]
   for further details of the specific security measures.
   Additionally, [RFC5920] provides an overview of security
   vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control
   plane.

3. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the
   "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling
                     Expires September 2016               [Page 2]

   Parameters" registry. The registry currently is defined to use
   the Standards Action registration policy as defined by
   [RFC5226].

   This document requests that the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of
   the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   Signaling Parameters" registry be updated with registration
   policies of "Standards Action" for Standards Track documents,
   and "Specification Required" for other documents.

   When needed, the Designated Expert shall be any current CCAMP WG
   chair or, in the case the group is no longer active, designated
   by the IESG.
