1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data definition language that was introduced to
   define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows networked
   devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is proving

   relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other interfaces
   (e.g.  ReST) and encodings other than XML (e.g.  JSON) are being
   defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the basis of
   implementation for other interfaces, such as CLI and programmatic
   APIs.

   This document defines a YANG model that can be used to configure and
   manage BGP L3VPNs [RFC4364].  It contains VRF sepcific parameters as
   well as BGP specific parameters applicable for L3VPNs.  The
   individual containers defined in this model contain control knobs for
   configuration for that purpose, as well as a few data nodes that can
   be used to monitor health and gather statistics.

3.  Design of BGP L3VPN Data Model

3.1.  Overview

   There are two parts of the BGP L3VPN yang data model.  The first part
   of the model defines VRF specific parameters for L3VPN by augmenting
   the network-instance container defined in the network instance model
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model] and the second part of the model defines
   BGP specific parameters for the L3VPN by augmenting the base BGP data
   model defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] .

3.2.  VRF Specific Configuration

   IETF network instance model defines various ni-types, one of which is
   l3vpn.  This provides an anchor point to add a new container l3vpn.
   Under this container per VPN parameters pertaining to L3VPN are
   added.

3.2.1.  VRF interface

   To associate a VRF instance with an interface, bind-network-instance
   config should be used.  This is covered in the base network instance
   model [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model].

3.2.2.  Route distinguisher

   Route distinguisher (RD) is an unique identifier used in VPN routes
   to distinguish prefixes across different VPNs.  RD is 8 byte field as
   defined in the [RFC4364].  Where the first two bytes refer to type
   followed by 6 bytes of value.  The format of the value is dependent
   on type.  In the yang model, RD is defined under l3vpn container
   under a network-instance.  Yang datatype for RD is imported from
   [RFC8294].

3.2.3.  Import and export route targets

   Route-target (RT) is an extended community used to specify the rules
   for importing and exporting the routes for each VRF as defined in
   [RFC4364].  This is applicable in the context of an address-family
   under the VRF.  Under the l3vpn container, statements for import and
   export route-targets are added for ipv4 and ipv6 address family.
   Both import and export sets are modeled as a list of rout-targets,
   yang datatype for which is imported from [RFC8294].  An import rule
   is modeled as list of RTs or a leafref to the route policy
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] specifying the list of RTs to be
   matched for importing the routes into the VRF.  Similarly, an export
   rule is modeled as a list of RTs or a leafref the route policy [I-
   D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] specifying the list of RTs which should be

Internet-Draft                                                April 2021


   attached to routes exported from the VRF.  In the case where policy
   is used to specify the RTs, a reference to the policy via leafref is
   used in this model, but actual definition of policy is outside the
   scope of this document.  In addition, this section also defines
   parameters for the import from global routing table and export to
   global routing table, as well as route limit per VPN instance for
   ipv4 and ipv6 address family.

3.2.4.  Forwarding mode

   This configuration augments interface list under interface container
   under a network instance as defined in IETF network instance model
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model].  Forwarding mode configuration is required
   under the ASBR facing interface to enable mpls forwarding for
   directly connected BGP peers for inter-as option B peering.

3.2.5.  Label security

   For inter-as option-B peering across ASs, under the ASBR facing
   interface, mpls label security enables the checks for RPF label on
   incoming packets.  Ietf-interface container is augmented to add this
   config.

3.3.  BGP Specific Configuration

   The BGP specific configuration for L3VPNs is defined by augmenting
   base BGP model [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].  In particular, specific
   knobs are added under neighbor and address family containers to
   handle VPN routes and ASBR peering.

3.3.1.  VPN peering

   For peering between PE routers, specific VPN address family needs to
   be enabled under BGP container in the context of core instance.  Base
   BGP draft [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] has l3vpn address family in the
   list of identity refs for AFs under global and neighbor modes.  The
   same is augmented here for additional knobs.  For peering with CE
   routers the VRF specific BGP configurations such as neighbors and
   address-family are covered in base BGP config, except that such
   configuration will be in the context of a VRF.  The instance of BGP
   in this case would be a separate instance in the context of vrf-root
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model].

3.3.2.  VPN prefix limits

   Limits for max number of VPN prefixes for a PE router is defined in
   the context of VPN address family under BGP.  This would be the total
   number of prefixes in VPN table per AF in the context of BGP
   protocol.  Route table limit for ipv4 and ipv6 address family for
   each VPN instance is also defined under BGP.  The total prefix limit
   per VPN, including all the protocols is defined in the context of VRF
   address family under routing instance.

3.3.3.  Label Mode

   Label mode knobs control the label allocation behavior for VRF
   routes.  Such as to specify Per-site, Per-vpn and Per-route label
   allocation.  These knobs augment BGP global AF containers in the
   context of default routing instance.

3.3.4.  ASBR options

   This includes few specific knobs for ASBR peering methods illustrated
   in [RFC4364].  Such as route target retention on ASBRs for inter-as
   VPN peering across ASBRs with option-B method.  Appropriate
   containers under BGP AF are augmented.

5.  IANA Considerations

6.  Security Considerations

   The transport protocol used for sending the BGP L3VPN data MUST
   support authentication and SHOULD support encryption.  The data-model
   by itself does not create any security implications.  This draft does
   not change any underlying security issues inherent
   in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model] and [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank TBD for their detail reviews and
   comments.
