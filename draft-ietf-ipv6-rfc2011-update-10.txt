This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes managed objects used for implementations of the
Internet Protocol (IP) in an IP version independent manner.  This memo
obsoletes RFCs 2011, 2465 and 2466.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework


For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC
3410 [9].


Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally accessed
through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the
MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module that is




Routhier, Editor                                    Section 1.  [Page 2]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [1], STD
58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [3].


2.  Revision History


One of the primary purposes of this revision of the IP MIB is to create
a single set of objects to describe and manage IP modules in an IP
version independent manner.  Where RFCs 2465 and 2466 created a set of
objects independent from RFC2011 this document merges those three
documents into a single unified set of objects.  The ipSystemStatsTable
and ipIfStatsTable tables are examples of updating objects to be
independent of IP version.  Both of these tables contain counters to
reflect IP traffic statistics that originated in much earlier MIBs and
both include an IP address type in order to separate the information
based on IP version.


Another purpose of this document is to increase the manageability of a
node running IPv6 by adding new objects.  Some of these tables, such as
ipDefaultRouterTable, may be useful on both IPv4 and IPv6 nodes while
others, such as ipv6RouterAdvertTable, are specific to a single
protocol.

     Added a value constraint on ipAddressPrefixLength


     Added text to explain why ipNetToMediaIfIndex and
     ipNetToMediaNetAddress have a max access value of read-create
     rather than not-accessible.


     Modified several objects to use a syntax of Integer32 instead of
     INTEGER: ipDefaultTTL and ip6DefaultHopLimit.


     Added the suffix 'TC' to IpAddressPrefixOriginTC,
     IpAddressOriginTC, ipAddressStatusTC, and ipv6InterfaceIdentifierTC

     Added text to the description of the stats tables and to the
     compliance statements of the HC groups to reinforce that the 32 bit
     counters are the low order 32 bits of the 64 bit counters and that
     the 32 bit counters are required even if the 64 bit counters are
     included.


     Added text suggesting that the spinlocks be the first varbind for
     their objects in a PDU.


     Specified that if ipAddressStorageType is permanent, no other

Routhier, Editor                                    Section 2.  [Page 5]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004

     Added OutFragOks to the case diagram and a note describing the
     intended relationship between the various fragment counters.


Changes from draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2011-update-04.txt


December 2003


     Corrected descriptive text for inetIcmpOutMsgs.  It was referring
     to messages received, it now refers to messages sent.


     Modified several objects to use InetVersion instead of
     InetAddressType.  These objects were using the address type to
     specify a version and can now make use of the more specific TC.
     Changed ipSystemStatsAFType to ipSystemStatsIPVersion, changed
     ipIfStatsAFType to ipIfStatsIPVersion, changed inetIcmpAFType to




Routhier, Editor                                    Section 2.  [Page 6]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     inetIcmpIPVersion and inetIcmpMsgAFType to inetIcmpMsgIPVersion.


     Modified the ipAddressTable to allow entries to be created or
     modified.  This entailed the addition of ipAddressSpinLock,
     ipAddressRowStatus and ipAddressStorageType objects.  Also
     ipAddressIfIndex, ipAddressType and ipAddressStatus were made read-
     create.


     In the case diagram moved the incrementing of InHdrErrors to occur
     before the incrementing of InMcastPkts and InBcastPkts.


     Moved the broadcast counters into separate groups to allow them to
     be tagged as required only for systems including IPv4.


     Added note 5 to the case diagram describing the desired outcome
     when counting short packets (header errors vs truncated packets).


     Added text to note 2 of the case diagram to specify which discard
     counter may be incremented.


     Clarified text about summing interface levels statistics into
     system level statistics.


     Added ipv6InterfaceForwarding and made the object mandatory.  Also
     included text suggesting that a simple system that doesn't allow
     forwarding to be enabled on a per-interface basis could set these
     objects to "forward" and rely on ip6Forwarding to enable or disable
     forwarding for the system.


     Modified the size restrictions on ipv6InterfaceReasmMaxSize to be
     (1500..65535).


     Added ipv4InterfaceRetransmitTime and made it mandatory for IPv4
     entities.


     Made ipDefaultRouterIfIndex part of the index for
     ipDefaultRouterTable.


     Changed ipv6ScopeZoneIndexSubnetLocal to ipv6ScopeZoneIndex3.


     Modified the size restrictions on ipv6RouterAdvertDefaultLifetime
     to be (0 | 4..9000).


     Added HC counters for InForwDatagrams, InDelivers, OutRequests and
     OutForwDatagrams.


     Modified the text for OutForwDatagrams to allow for forwarding of
     locally generated packets.  Also added a note to the Case diagram




Routhier, Editor                                    Section 2.  [Page 7]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     mentioning that the forwarding counters may be incremented even if
     the packets are generated by or destined for the local host.


     Added references for the router selection draft and the update to
     2096.


     Removed the size constraint on indexes of type InetAddress.


     Changed ipDefaultRouterAFType to ipDefaultRouterAddressType


Changes from draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2011-update-03.txt


September 2003


     Deprecated the ipRoutingDiscards object and add some text to
     describe why and that the new version specific object can be found
     in the IP-FORWARD-MIB.


     Modified the syntax for ipIfStatsIfIndex to be InterfaceIndex
     instead of InterfaceIndexOrZero as we no longer need the capability
     of using zero within the index.  (The MIB originally used a zero
     index to specify the system level statistics.)


     Added a description clause to the ipAddressGroup object.


     Added the ipLastChangeGroup to ipMIBComliance2 with a description
     of optional.


     Changed draft-ietf-ipngwg-addr-arch-v3-11.txt to RFC3513.


Changes from draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2011-update-02.txt


June 2003


     Removed the ipv4 and ipv6 only requirements on the
     ipSystemStatsAFType and ipIfStatsAFType objects.  Instead added a
     pseudo compliance statement requiring only global ipv4 and ipv6
     types for those two objects as well as inetIcmpAFType and
     inetIcmpMsgAFType.


     Added a pseudo compliance statement requiring only global ipv4 and
     ipv6 types for ipAddressPrefixType.


     Added a pseudo compliance statement requiring only global and non
     global ipv4 and ipv6 types for ipAddressAddrType,
     inetNetToMediaNetAddressType and ipDefaultRouterAFType






Routhier, Editor                                    Section 2.  [Page 8]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     In response to a question about the size constraint on the various
     InetAddress objects (0..36).  I have decided to leave this as is
     for now.  The actually size will be one of 4, 8, 16 or 20 depending
     on the type in use and the syntax could be reduced to cover those
     sizes.  However using such a small limit might require a new mib if
     a new address type is added to the InetAddress MIB that uses a
     larger size.  36 seems to be a reasonable compromise for allowing
     possible growth but avoiding problems with index length
     limitations.


May 2003


     Restored ipRoutingDiscards to a current object from the deprecated
     group per discussions with previous MIB authors.  The argument to
     move it to deprecated relied on the fact that it really belongs
     with the routing group rather than the main IP group.  However as
     it already exists in the IP group and any router must contain the
     IP group it is not reasonable to remove it and create a new object
     in the routing area simply to adjust where the object is rooted in
     the MIB tree.  This object was placed in a new group
     "ipRoutingGroup" and the group was made mandatory in order to mimic
     the previous MIB.


     Changed the text to use "address type" or "address types" instead
     of "address family" or "address families" in order to avoid any
     confusion with the term as used by IANA in the assignment of
     address family numbers.


     Added some text to the description of ipAddressTable to remind
     users that link-local addresses must use the "ipv6z" type.




Changes from draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2011-update-01.txt


February 2003


     Added ipLastChangeGroup which makes the lastChange objects a SHOULD
     for agents that have the proper values available.


     Added normative references for IMPORTed mibs.


January 2003


     Editorial cleanup.


     Renamed the ipv4If entries to ipv4Interface in order to be similar
     to the ipv6Interface entries.




Routhier, Editor                                    Section 2.  [Page 9]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     Updated the SNMP boilerplate.


     Updated the references to remove many SNMP specific entries and
     split the remainder into normative and informative.


     Updated the security considerations section.


     Decided not to add the netmask or BcastAddr information from the
     deprecated ipAddrTable into the new mib as there was no major
     support for them.


     Removed IPv6 conformance and compliance OIDs as they are no longer
     in use.


     Renamed ipv6Forwarding and ipv6DefaultHopLimit to ip6Forwarding and
     ip6DefaultHopLimit and moved them from the IPv6 branch to the IP
     branch, thus removing the last objects in the IPv6 branch.


     Added ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock and ipv6RouterAdvertRowStatus


     Added ipv4IfTableLastChange, ipv6IfTableLastChange and
     ipIfStatsTableLastChange.


     Renumbered pretty much everything at the IP branch level in order
     to rationalize things and fit in the new objects.


Changes from draft-ops-rfc2011-update-02.txt:


October 2002


     Renumbered objects in groups that had objects removed from one
     draft to another.  As per SMI rules no objects that have been
     published in an RFC have been renumbered.  The affected areas are:
     ipv6InterfaceTable, ipIfStatsTable, inetIcmpTable and
     inetIcmpMsgTable


     Split the ipIfStatsTable into two tables under a common OID.  The
     two tables are ipSystemStatsTable which contains system-wide
     statistics and ipIfStatsTable which contains interface-specific
     statistics.  The same counters are available from both tables.


     The compliance and conformance section was rebuilt.  ipGroup2 was
     renamed to ipv4GeneralGroup and ipReasmTimeout was added to it.
     The following groups were created:  ipv4IfGroup, ipv6Ifgroup,
     ipSystemStatsGroup, ipSystemStatsHCOctetGroup,
     ipSystemStatsHCPacketGroup, ipIfStatsGroup, ipIfStatsHCOctetGroup,
     ipIfStatsHCPacketGroup, ipAddressPrefixGroup, ipAddressGroup,
     ipNetToMediaGroup, ipDefaultRouterGroup, ipv6RouterAdvertGroup and

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     icmpGroup2.  The compliance section allows a compliant agent to
     provide read-only access to all of the nominally read-write
     objects.


     Many minor changes to deal with errors found from mib compilers.


     Changed the indexing from inetNetToMediaEntry to use a local copy
     of the ifIndex.


     Import InetZoneIndex for use a scope index.  Previously this was
     the ScopeIdentifier TC defined within this document.  Also change
     the naming convention for scopes to use index instead of
     identifier.


     Close several issues without changes:


     Should we include an object or objects to express the capability of
     an implementation with respect to items like extension headers for
     IPv6.  I have decided to not include such objects.  I believe that
     we should wait for some deployment experience to see if such
     objects would be useful and to determine their proper granularity.


     Are there other items that could be added to the ipv{4 6}IfTables
     such as (for v4) directed broadcast, proxy arp, header compression,
     broadcast address and arp cache timeout.  As I receive only one
     request for such objects I have not added them.


     Is there a better SMI data type for the lifetime objects in the
     ipAddressPrefixTable, ipDefaultRouterTable and
     ipv6RouterAdvertTable.  I don't think there is a better SMI data
     type.  We could generate some TCs for them (there are several
     classes of lifetime) but I don't think that would be useful.


     There was a note in the v6 interface table suggesting that some of
     the objects could be removed.  I think we have now removed all of
     those objects and don't intend to remove more without comments.


     Should the ipv6ScopeZoneIndexTable include associated objects to
     provide a scope description similar to ipMRouteScopeNameString
     (rfc2932)?


     My current decision is to NOT add such an object or set of objects.
     Should the ipv6AddressIfIdentifier be dropped?  I think this
     provides some utility in specifying the how addresses are formed
     (at least some of them).  There is also the further question of
     moving the Ipv6AddressIfIdentifier TC somewhere else.  I don't
     think it is completely an EUI and therefore it should have a TC
     somewhere other than the IF-MIB and here seems reasonable.

     Any other objects from ipv6IfTable that we need? I don't think so.


     Are there other possible sources for ipAddressPrefixOrigin?  No
     additions were suggested and no action was taken.



Changes from draft-ops-rfc2011-update-00.txt:


May 2002


     Removed ipv6InterfaceEffectiveMtu and
     ipv6InterfaceIdentifierLength.


     Added text to ipAddressPrefixTable to describe its utility.


     Added text to ipAddressTable to state that multicast addresses are
     described in their own table(s).


     Added ipv4IfAdminStatus and ipv6InterfaceAdminStatus.


     Added text to ipAddressPrefixOrigin to describe that an address
     becomes well known by assignment from IANA or the address
     registries or by specification in a standards track RFC.


     Added text to ipAddressOrigin to clarify the manual vs random
     difference.


     Added text to inetNetToMediaType to clarify the difference between
     static and local.


     Created textual conventions for the following IpAddressOrigin,
     IpAddressStatus and IpAddressPrefixOrigin.


     Added persistence information to all read-write and read-create
     objects:


     ipForwarding & ipDefaultTTL - should be persistent


     ipv6Forwarding, ipv4AdminStatus & ipv6InterfaceAdminStatus - SHOULD
     be persistent


     ipv6InterfaceIdentifier - modified from RW to Read-only


     ipNetToMediaPhysAddress & ipNetToMediaType - should not be
     persistent


     inetNetToMediaPhysAddress & inetNetToMediaType - SHOULD NOT be
     persistent

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     Added text to specify that ifIndex objects (ipv4IfIndex,
     ipv6InterfaceIfIndex, ipIfStatsIfIndex, ipAddressPrefixIfIndex,
     ipAddressIfIndex and ipv6ScopeIdIfIndex) use the same indexes as
     ifIndex.


     Removed ifIndex and code from the descriptions of inetIcmpMsg{In
     Out}Pkts.


     Updated the text for the objects in the ipIfStatsTable.  The new
     text allows them to be either system wide or interface specific.
     It also clarifies which interface should be used for some objects.
     Finally descriptions were added to some newer objects.


     Added ipIfStatsRefreshRate


     Modified the author information.  The main author list has been
     moved to a section within the document and replaced on the front
     page with the editor's name.  The MIB contact information has been
     modified.


     Added text mentioning that ARP (RFC826) and ND (RFC2461) are the
     two most likely ways of populating the Net to Media table.


     Added a reference clause to inetIcmpMsgType pointing to the IANA
     pages for ICMP and ICMPv6 parameters.


     Added text mentioning that ipIfStatsInTooBigErrors is only valid
     for IPv6 but that it should be instantiated for IPv4 as well.


     Added text to the ipAddressPrefixTable and it's objects mentioning
     that it isn't tuned for IPv4 and defaults to use for IPv4
     addresses.


     Added the ipAddressLastChanged object.


     Added reference clauses to ipv6DefaultHopLimit and several objects
     in the ipAddressPrefix table.  I don't think that any other objects
     that don't already have some text have something to reference.


     Modified the IP statistics table.


     ipIfStatsHCInUcastPkts became ipIfStatsHCInReceives


     removed ipIfStatsInTooBigErrors and include those packets in
     ipIfStatsOutFragFails


     added ipIfStatsInForwDatagrams to count packets that we attempt to
     forward




Routhier, Editor                                   Section 2.  [Page 13]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     clarified the text in ipIfStatsOutForwDatagrams to make it clear
     that "success" was related to the forwarding step and not the
     transmission step


     added ipIfStatsOutTransmits and ipIfStatsHCOutTransmits as counters
     of the packets sent to the lower layers and pointed the OutOctet
     counters to them


     added ipIfStatsOutNoRoutes to count the number of locally generated
     datagrams that couldn't be transmitted as no route was found


     added ipIfStatsOutFragReqds to count the number of datagrams that
     require fragmentation


     Added text and a Case diagram describing the statistics table.


     Added the ipAddressCreated object.


     Removed ipIfStatsHCOutUcastPkts as HCOutTransmits replaces it.


     Also re-arranged the statsTable sequence to try and group the
     objects more rationally.


     Added reachable and retransmit times to the ipv6InterfaceTable


     Added Default router list.


     Added router advertisement configuration table.


November 2001


     Modified the ICMP message table to remove some indexes.  The table
     no longer tracks counters with per-interface or per-ICMP code
     granularity.


12 Jul 2001


     Changed to IPNG working group work item.


     Removed mention of SIIT, since it's just for transition


     Added lots of counters to ipIfStats table, and
     ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime


     Changed ipAddressIfIndex and ScopeIdentifier to refer to IF-MIB
     instead of RFC 2863 or RFC 2233

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     Removed text about agents supporting a subset of values from
     ipv6Forwarding; this belongs in an AGENT-CAPABILITIES.


     Un-deprecated ipReasmTimeout.  XXX Do we need ipv6ReasmTimeout too?
     I think not; RFC2460 seems to say that it's a constant 60 seconds.


Changes from first draft posted to v6mib mailing list:


23 Feb 2001


     Added ipv4InterfaceTable


     Added ipv6InterfaceTable


     Added ipAddressPrefixTable and slightly reworked ipAddressTable
     (nee inetAddressTable).


     Deprecated ipMIBCompliance.  Still need to finish updated ones.


     Added copyright and table of contents.


7 Feb 2001


     Renamed inetIfStats to ipIfStats


     Added ipv6ScopeTable


     Added ScopeIdentifier TC, which should be in INET-ADDRESS-MIB.


     Added SIZE to inetAddrAddr and inetNetToMediaAddress


     Wrote some boilerplate for multi-interface-or-system-wide counter
     tables.


3.  Overview




3.1.  Multi-Stack Implementations


This MIB does not provide native support for implementations of multiple
stacks sharing the same address type.  One option for supporting such
designs is to assign each stack within an address type to a separate
context.  These contexts could then be selected based upon the context
name, with the Entity MIB and VACM Context Table providing methods for
listing the supported contexts.






Routhier, Editor                                 Section 3.1.  [Page 15]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



3.2.  Discussion of Tables and Groups


This MIB is composed of a small number of discrete objects and a series
of tables meant to form the base for managing IPv4 and IPv6 entities.


While some of the objects are meant to be included in all entities some
of the objects are only conditionally mandatory.  The unconditionally
mandatory objects are mostly counters for IP and ICMP statistics.  The
conditionally mandatory objects fall into one of several groups: objects
for use in higher bandwidth situations, objects for use with IPv4,
objects for use with IPv6 and objects for use on IPv6 routers.  In short
it is not expected that every entity will implement all of the objects
within this MIB.  The reader should consult the conformance and
compliance section to determine which objects are appropriate for a
given entity.



3.2.1.  General Objects


In both IPv4 and IPv6 there are only a small number of "knobs" for
controlling the general IP stack.  Most controls will be in a more
specific setting, such as for controlling a router or TCP engine.


This MIB defines a total of three general knobs only two of which are
used for both IPv4 and IPv6.


Objects are included for both protocols to enable or disable forwarding
and to set limits on the lifetime of a packet (ttl or hop count).


The third knob, the timeout period for reassembling fragments, is only
defined for IPv4 as IPv6 specifies this value directly.


Each group of objects is required when implementing their respective
protocols.



3.2.2.  Interface Tables


This MIB includes a pair of tables to convey information about the IPv4
and IPv6 protocols that is interface specific.


Special note should be taken of the administrative status objects.
These are defined to allow each protocol to selectively enable or
disable interfaces.  These objects can be used in conjunction with the
ifAdminStatus object to manipulate the interfaces as necessary.  With
these three objects an interface may be enabled or disabled completely
as well as connected to the IPv4 stack, the IPv6 stack or both stacks.
Setting ifAdminStatus to "down" should not affect the protocol specific




Routhier, Editor                               Section 3.2.2.  [Page 16]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



status objects.


Each interface table is required when implementing their respective
protocols.



3.2.3.  IP Statistics Tables


The IP statistics tables (ipSystemStatsTable and ipIfStatsTable) contain
objects to count the number of datagrams and octets that a given entity
has processed.  Unlike the previous attempt this document uses a single
table for multiple address types.  Typically the only two types of
interest are IPv4 and IPv6; however the table can support other types if
necessary.


The first table, ipSystemStatsTable, conveys system wide information.
(That is, the various counters are for all interfaces and not a specific
set of interfaces.)  Its index is formed from a single sub-id that
represents the address type for which the statistics were counted.


The second table, ipIfStatsTable, conveys interface specific
information.  Its index is formed from two sub-ids.  The first
represents the address type (IPv4 and IPv6) and the interface within
that address type is represented by the second sub-id.


The two tables have a similar set of objects which are intended to count
the same things except for the difference in granularity.  The object ID
"ipSystemStatsEntry.2" is reserved in order to align the object ids of
the counters in the first table with their counterparts in the second
table.


Several objects of note are ipSystemStatsDiscontinuityTime,
ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime, ipSystemsStatsRefreshRate and
ipIfStatsRefreshRate.  These objects provide information about the row
in the table more than about the system itself.


The discontinuity objects allow a management entity to determine if a
discontinuity event which would invalidate the management entity's
understanding of the counters has occurred.  The system being re-
initialized or the interface being cycled are possible examples of a
discontinuity event.


The refresh objects allow a management entity to determine a proper
polling interval for the rest of the objects.


The following Case diagram represents the general ordering of the packet
counters.  In order to avoid extra clutter the prefixes "ipSystemStats"
and "ipIfStats" have been removed from each of the counter names.

(1) The HC counters and octet counters are also found at these points
but have been left out for clarity.


(2) The discard counters may increment at any time in the processing
path.  Packets discarded to the left of InNoRoutes cause the InDiscards
counter to increment while those discarded to the right are counted in
the OutDiscards counters.


(3) Local packets on the input side are counted on the interface
associated with their destination address, which may not be the
interface on which they were received.  This requirement is caused by
the possibility of losing the original interface during processing,
especially re-assembly.


(4) Some re-assembly algorithms may lose track of the number of
fragments during processing and so some fragments may not be counted in
this object.


(5) InTruncatedPkts should only be incremented if the frame contained a
valid header but was otherwise shorter than required.  Frames that are
too short to contain a valid header should be counted as InHdrErrors.


(6) The forwarding objects may be incremented even for packets that were
originated locally or are destined for the local host if their addresses
are such that the local host would need to forward the packet to pass it
to the correct interface.


(7) When fragmenting a packet an entity should increment the
OutFragFails counter rather than the OutDiscards counter in order to
preserve the equation FragOks + FragFails == FragRqds.


The objects in both tables are spread amongst several conformance groups
based on the bandwidth required to wrap the counters within an hour.
The base system group is mandatory for all entities.  The other system

groups are optional depending on bandwidth.  The interface specific-
groups are optional.



3.2.4.  Internet Address Prefix Table


This table provides information about the prefixes that this entity is
using including their lifetimes.  This table provides a convenient place
to which other tables that make use of prefixes, such as the
ipAddressTable, may point.  By including this table the MIB can supply
the prefix information for all addresses yet minimize the amount of
duplication required in storing and accessing this data.  This
arrangement also makes the relationship between addresses that have the
same prefix clear.


This table is required for IPv6 entities.



3.2.5.  Internet Address Table


This table lists the IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) used by this
entity.  It also includes some basic information about how and when the
address was formed and last updated.  This table allows a manager to
determine who a given entity thinks it is.


This table is required for all IP entities.



3.2.6.  Internet Address Translation Table


This table provides a mapping between IP layer addresses and physical
addresses as would be formed by either ARP for IPv4 or the neighbor
discovery protocol for IPv6.



3.2.7.  IPv6 Scope Zone Index


This table specifies the zone index to interface mapping.  By examining
the table a manager can determine which groups of interfaces are within
a particular zone for a given scope.


The zone index information is only valid within a given entity, the
indexes used on one entity may not be comparable to those used on a
different entity.


This table is required for IPv6 entities.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



3.2.8.  Default Router Table


This table lists the default routers known to this entity.  This table
is intended to be a simple list to display the information end nodes may
have been configured with or acquired through a simple system such as
IPv6 router advertisements.  Managers attempting to view more
complicated routing information should examine the routing specific
tables from other MIBs.


This table is required for all entities.



3.2.9.  Router Advertisement Table


This table contains the non-routing information that an IPv6 router
would use in constructing a router advertisement message.  It does not
contain information about the prefixes or other routing specific
information that the router might advertise.  The router should acquire
such information from either the routing tables or from some routing
table specific MIB.


This table is only required for IPv6 router entities.



3.2.10.  ICMP Statistics Tables


There are two sets of statistics for ICMP.  The first contains a simple
set of counters to track the number of ICMP messages and errors
processed by this entity.


The second supplies more detail about the ICMP messages processed by
this entity.  Its index is formed from two sub-ids.    The first
represents the address type (IPv4 and IPv6) and the particular message
type being counted is represented by the second sub-id.


Both of these tables are required for all entities.



3.2.11.  Conformance and Compliance


This MIB contains several sets of objects.  Some of these sets are
useful on all types of entities while others are only useful on a
limited subset of entities.  The conformance section attempts to group
the objects into sets that may be discussed as units and the compliance
section then details which of these units are required in various
circumstances.


The circumstances used in the compliance section are implementing IPv4,

IPv6 or IPv6 router functions and having bandwidth less than 20MB,
between 20MB and 650MB or greater than 650MB.



3.2.12.  Deprecated Objects


This MIB also includes a set of deprecated objects from previous
iterations.  They are included as part of the historical record.



4.  Updating Implementations


There are several general classes of change that are required.


The first and most major change is that most of the previous objects
have different object ids and additional indexes to support the
possibility of different address types.  The general counters for IP and
ICMP are examples of this.  They have been moved to the
ipSystemStatsTable and icmpMsgStatsTable respectively.


The second change is the extension of all address objects to allow for
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and the addition of an address type object
to specify what address type is in use.


The third change is the addition of several new objects to the
replacement for a previously existing table such as ipNetToPhysical.


The fourth change is the addition of completely new tables such as
ipIfStatsTable and ipDefaultRouterTable.  The first is based on the
previous statistics groups while the second is completely new to this
MIB.




4.1.  Updating an implementation of the IPv4-only IP-MIB


The somewhat more specific changes that are required for IPv4 follow.
Note well:  this is not meant to be an exhaustive list and the reader
should examine the MIB for full details.


Several of the general objects (ipForwarding, ipDefaultTTL,
ipReasmTimeout) remain unchanged.


Most of the rest of the general objects were counters and have been
moved into the ipSystemStatsTable.  The basic instrumentation should
remain the same though the object definitions should be checked for any
clarifications.  If they aren't already in a structure putting the
counter variables in one would be useful.  Several new objects have been

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



added to count additional items, instrumentation code must be added for
these objects.  Finally the SNMP routines must be updated to handle the
new indexing.


In addition to the ipSystemStatsTable the MIB includes the
ipIfStatsTable.  This table counts the same items as the system table
but does so on a per interface basis.  It is optional and may be
ignored.  If you decide to implement it you may wish to arrange to
collect the data on a per-interface basis and then sum those counters in
order to provide the aggregate system level statistics.  However if you
choose to provide the system level statistics by summing the interface
level counters no interface level statistics can be lost - if an
interface is removed the statistics associated with it must be retained.


The ipAddrTable has, loosely, been converted to the ipAddressTable.
While the general idea remains the same the ipAddressTable is
sufficiently different that writing new code may be easier than updating
old code.  The primary difference is the addition of several new
objects.  In addition the ipAdEntReasmMaxSize has been moved to another
table, ipv4InterfaceTable.  As above the SNMP routines will need to be
updated to handle the new indexing.


The ipNetToMediaTable has been moved to the ipNetToPhysicalTable.  These
tables are fairly similar and updating the old code may be
straightforward.  As above the SNMP routines will need to be updated to
handle the new indexing.


Two new tables, ipv4InterfaceTable and ipDefaultRouterTable, are
required as well as several new ICMP counters.


Finally there are several tables that are required for IPv6 but are
optional for IPv4 that you may elect to implement.



4.2.  Updating an implementation of the IPv6-MIB


The somewhat more specific changes that are required for IPv6 follow.
Note well:  this is not meant to be an exhaustive list and the reader
should examine the MIB for full details.


Two of the general objects, ipv6Forwarding and ipv6DefaultHopLimit, have
been renamed and given new object identifiers within the ip branch but
are otherwise unchanged.  The new names are ipv6IpForwarding and
ipv6IpDefaultHopLimit.


While there is an ipv6InterfaceTable that contains some of the pieces
from the ipv6IfTable the two are somewhat different in concept.  The
ipv6IfTable was meant to replicate the ifTable while the




Routhier, Editor                                 Section 4.2.  [Page 23]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



ipv6InterfaceTable is meant to be an addition to the ifTable.  As such
items that were duplicated between the ifTable and ipv6IfTable have been
removed and some new objects added.


The ipv6IfStatsTable most closely resembles the ipIfStatsTable with an
additional index for the address type and most of the instrumentation
should be re-usable.  Some new objects have been added to the
ipIfStatsTable.  As above the SNMP routines will need to be updated to
handle the new indexing.  Finally the ipIfStatsTable is optional and may
be ignored.


The ipSystemStatsTable is effectively new, but it may be able to make
use of most of the instrumentation from the old ipv6IfStatsTable.  As
with the IPv4 discussion one implementation strategy would be to count
the statistics for the ipIfStatsTable and aggregate them when queried
for this table.  Again, as with the IPv4 discussion, this strategy only
works if the interfaces can not be removed or if the statistics for
removed interfaces are somehow retained.


The ipv6AddrPrefixTable is now the ipAddressPrefixTable.  The new table
contains an extra object and the additional index required for IPv4
compatibility.  As above the SNMP routines will need to be updated to
handle the new indexing.


The ipAddressTable is loosely based on the ipv6AddrTable but has changed
considerably with the addition of several new objects and the removal of
one of its indexes.


The IPv6 routing information (ipv6RouteNumber, ipv6DiscardedRoutes and
ipv6RouteTable) has been removed from this MIB.  The replacements or
updates for this information is in the update to the IP Forwarding Table
MIB [16].  The ipv6NetToMediaTable has been converted to the
ipNetToPhysicalTable.  The new table contains an extra object and the
additional index required for IPv4 compatibility.  As above the SNMP
routines will need to be updated to handle the new indexing.


The ICMP tables have been substantially changed.  The previous tables
required counting on a per-message and per-interface basis.  The new
tables only require counting on a per-message per-protocol basis and
include an aggregate of all messages on a per-protocol basis.


In addition to the above several new tables have been added.  Both the
ipv6ScopeZoneIndexTable and ipDefaultRouterTable are required on all
IPv6 entities.  The ipv6RouterAdvertTable is only required on IPv6
routers.

-- Per-Interface or System-Wide IP statistics.

-- The following two tables, ipSystemStatsTable and ipIfStatsTable

-- The ipSystemStatsTable provides system wide counters aggregating
-- the traffic counters for all interfaces for a given address type.
-- The ipIfStatsTable provides the same counters but for specific
-- interfaces rather than as an aggregate.
--
-- Note well: If a system provides both system-wide and interface-specific
-- values the system-wide value may not be equal to the sum of the
-- interface-specific values across all interfaces due to e.g. dynamic
-- interface creation/deletion.
--
-- Note well: Both of these tables contain some items that are represented
-- by two objects, representing the value in either 32 or 64 bits.  For
-- those objects the 32 bit value MUST be the low order 32 bits of the

           "This table allows the user to determine the source of an IP
            address or set of IP addresses and allows other tables to
            share the information via pointer rather than by copying.


            For example when the node configures both a unicast and
            anycast address for a prefix the ipAddressPrefix objects for
            those addresses will point to a single row in this table.


            This table primarily provides support for IPv6 prefixes and
            several of the objects are less meaningful for IPv4.  The
            table continues to allow IPv4 addresses to allow future
            flexibility.  In order to promote a common configuration
            this document includes suggestions for default values for
            IPv4 prefixes.  Each of these values may be overridden if an
            object is meaningful to the node.


            All prefixes used by this entity should be included in this
            table independent of how the entity learned the prefix.

            Tables for such information should be contained in multicast

            While this table is writable the user will note that several
            objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, are not.  The intention in

            add or remove any entry that isn't permanent.  The user
            should be  allowed to modify objects and entries when that
            would not cause inconsistencies within the table.  Allowing
            write access to objects such as ipAddressOrigin could allow
            a user to insert an entry and then label it incorrectly.


            Note well: When including IPv6 link-local addresses in this
            table the entry must use an InetAddressType of 'ipv6z' in
            order to differentiate between the possible interfaces.

    DESCRIPTION
           "The type of mapping.


            Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect
            of invalidating the corresponding entry in the
            ipNetToPhysicalTable.  That is, it effectively dis-
            associates the interface identified with said entry from the
            mapping identified with said entry.  It is an
            implementation- specific matter as to whether the agent
            removes an invalidated entry from the table.  Accordingly,
            management stations must be prepared to receive tabular
            information from agents that corresponds to entries not
            currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such entries
            requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType
            object.


            The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to
            physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved
            using e.g. IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol.


            The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been
            statically configured.  Both of these refer to entries that
            provide mappings for other entities addresses.


            The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided
            for an entity's own interface address.


            As the entries in this table are typically not persistent
            when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the

8.  Security Considerations


There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with
a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These are
the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:



     ipForwarding and ipv6IpForwarding - these objects allow a manager
     to enable or disable the routing functions on the entity.  By
     disabling the routing functions an attacker would possibly be able
     to deny service to users.  By enabling the routing functions an
     attacker could open a conduit into an area.  This might result in
     the area providing transit for packets it shouldn't or allow the
     attacker access to the area bypassing security safeguards.






Routhier, Editor                                  Section 8.  [Page 129]
INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004



     ipDefaultTTL and ipv6IpDefaultHopLimit - these objects allow a
     manager to determine the diameter of the valid area for a packet.
     By decreasing the value of these objects an attacker could cause
     packets to be discarded before reaching their destinations.



     ipv4InterfaceEnableStatus and ipv6InterfaceEnableStatus - these
     objects allow a manager to enable or disable IPv4 and IPv6 on a
     specific interface.  By enabling a protocol on an interface an
     attacker might be able to create an unsecured path into a node (or
     through it if routing is also enabled).  By disabling a protocol on
     an interface an attacker might be able to force packets to be
     routed through some other interface or deny access to some or all
     of the network via that protocol.


     ipAddressTable - the objects in this table specify the addresses in
     use on this node.  By modifying this information an attacker can
     cause a node to either ignore messages destined to it or accept (at
     least at the IP layer) messages it would otherwise ignore.  The use
     of filtering or security associations may reduce the potential
     damage in the latter case.


     ipv6RouterAdvertTable - the objects in this table specify the
     information that a router should propagate in its routing
     advertisement messages.  By modifying this information an attacker
     can interfere with the auto-configuration of all hosts on the link.
     Most modifications to this table will result in a denial of service
     to some or all hosts on the link.  However two objects,
     ipv6RouterAdvertManagedFlag and ipv6RouterAdvertOtherConfigFlag,
     indicate if a host should acquire configuration information from
     some other source.  By enabling these an attacker might be able to
     cause a host to retrieve its configuration information from a
     compromised source.


     ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress and ipNetToPhysicalType - these objects
     specify information used to translate a network (IP) address into a
     media dependent address.  By modifying these objects an attacker
     could disable communication with a node or divert messages from one
     node to another.  However the attacker may be able to carry out a
     similar attack by simply responding to the ARP or ND requests made
     by the target node.



Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:



     Essentially all of the objects in this MIB could be considered
     sensitive as they report on the status of the IP modules within a
     system.  However the ipSystemStatsTable, ipIfStatsTable and
     ipAddressTable are likely to be of most interest to an attacker.
     The statistics tables supply information about the quantity and
     type of traffic this node is processing and, especially for transit
     providers, may be considered sensitive.  The address table provides
     a convenient list of all address in use by this node.  Each address
     in isolation is unremarkable however the total list would allow an
     attacker to correlate otherwise unrelated traffic.  For example an
     attacker might be able to correlate the a RFC 3041 [15] private
     address with known public addresses thus circumventing the
     intentions of RFC 3041.



SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  Even
if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.


It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [9], section 8), including full
support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and
privacy).


Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that
the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module, is
properly configured to give access to the objects only to those
principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
(change/create/delete) them.

14.  RFC Editor Notes
-- RFC Editor
-- This section to be removed as well.


This section contains notes to the RFC Editor and should be removed
as the document is converted into an RFC.


Most of the revision history section is to be removed.  The sections to
be removed include all of the specific changes to various iterations of
the drafts and is indicated with a removal tag.


In the module identity section of the MIB (beginning of section 5)
the RFC number of this document must be added in the description field
and the first revision field (replacing xxxx).


In the reference section of object ipv6ScopeZoneIndexTable the reference
needs to be updated to refer to the correct document if the address
architecture document precedes this document as an RFC.


In the references section of object ipDefaultRouterPreference the reference
needs to be updated to refer to the correct document.


In the references section (7) the references to 3291Bis, 2096Bis and
the router selection RFC must be replaced with proper RFCs as those
numbers are assigned.


In the references section (7) the reference to 3513BIS should be replaced
with a proper RFC if the address architecture document precedes this one
as an RFC.
