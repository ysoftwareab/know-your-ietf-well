Abstract 
    
   This informational I-D describes the requirements for SIP telephony 
   devices, based on the deployment experience of large numbers of SIP 
   phones and PC clients using different implementations. The document 
   reviews the generic requirements for SIP telephony devices, the   
   automatic device configuration process, device configuration data 
   and examples for XML configuration data formats.  
        
   SIP telephony devices are highly complex IP endpoints that speak 
   many Internet protocols, have text, audio and visual interfaces, 
   various input modes, and require functionality targeted at several 
   constituencies: (1) End users, (2) service providers and network 
   administrators and (3) manufacturers and system integrators.  
        
   The objectives of the requirements are a minimum set of 
   interoperability and multi-vendor supported core features, so as to

  1. Introduction 
 
   This informational I-D has the objective of focusing the Internet   
   communications community on requirements for SIP [3] Telephony 
   devices.  
   We base this information on experience from developing and using a 
   large number of SIP telephony device types and on the experience 
   gained from large scale deployments in carrier and private IP 
   networks and on the Internet. This deployment has shown the need for 
   generic requirements for SIP telephony devices and also the need for 
   some specifics that can be used in SIP interoperability testing.  
       
   SIP telephony devices, also referred to as SIP User Agents (UAs) can 
   be any type of IP networked computing device enabled for SIP based 
   IP telephony. SIP telephony devices can be SIP phones, adaptors for   
   analog phones and fax machines, conference speakerphones, software 
   packages (soft clients) running on PCs, laptops, wireless connected 
   PDAs, as well as mobile and cordless phones that support SIP 
   signaling for real time communications.   
    
   SIP devices MAY also support various other media besides voice, such   
   as text, video, games and also possibly other Internet applications;   

                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                    [Page 3]

   however the non-voice requirements are not specified in this 
   document, except when providing enhanced telephony features, as will 
   be shown.  
       
   The objectives of the requirements are a minimum set of 
   interoperability and multi-vendor supported core features, so as to 
   enable similar ease of purchase, installation and operation as found 
   for standard PCs, analog feature phones or mobile phones.  Given the 
   cost of some screen phones or enterprise phones may approach the 
   cost of PCs and PDAs, and the larger number of phones compared to 
   PCs, similar or even better ease of use as compared to personal 
   computers and networked PDAs is expected by both end users and 
   network administrators.  
       
   As will be seen from the following, SIP telephony devices are highly 
   complex IP endpoints that speak many Internet protocols, have audio   
   and visual interfaces and require functionality targeted at several   
   constituencies: 1) End users, (2) service providers and network 
   administrators and (3), manufacturers, as well as system 
   integrators. 
  
2. Generic Requirements 
    
   We present here a minimal set of requirements that MUST be met by 
   all SIP telephony devices, as specified here, except where SHOULD or 
   MAY is specified.  
     
2.1 Link Layer Requirements 
 
   SIP devices MUST support either:  
     
   Link-1: Wired Ethernet IEEE 802.3 10Base-T 10 Mb/s Half Duplex, or  
       
   Link-2: Wireless Ethernet 802.11a/b/g 
       
   SIP devices MAY also support other link layer protocols, such as  
       
   Link-3: IEEE 802.3 10Base-T Full Duplex  
       
   Link-4: IEEE 802.3 100Base-T Half Duplex  
       
   Link-5: IEEE 802.3u 10/100Mb Auto-sensing 
    
   Link-6: SIP devices SHOULD support VLAN tagging as per IEEE 802.1q 
    
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                    [Page 4] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   Link layers used in 3rd generation mobile phone networks are out of 
   the scope for this document.  
       
      Power over Ethernet  
       
   Power-1: SIP telephony devices intended for desktop use MAY support   
   in-line power over Ethernet as specified in IEEE 802.3af.   
       
      Integrated Switch/Hub  
       
   SIP devices designed for wired Ethernet SHOULD have an uplink port   
   such that another IP device, such as a personal computer, MAY share   
   the network connection. SIP clients MUST prioritize the transmission 
   of the RTP traffic over the shared network connection. 
        
2.2 IP Requirements  
               
   IP-1: SIP telephony devices MUST be able to acquire an IP address 
   by:  
         Automatic IP address configuration using DHCP, or  
         Manual IP address entry from the device.  
       
   IP-2: SIP devices MUST support multiple DNS entries. If the primary   
   DNS server does not respond to a DNS request, a secondary DNS server   
   MUST be queried.  
       
   IP-3: SIP devices MUST support IPv4 DSCP field for RTP streams that 
   supercedes the TOS bits described in RFC 791. The DSCP bit setting 
   MUST be possible to be configured by either the user or 
   automatically by the downloaded configuration data. The Assured 
   Forwarding DSCP value Low Drop Precedence for RTP voice packets MUST 
   be 100010 [4].  
       
   IP-5: SIP devices SHOULD support IP version 6. 

2.3 SIP Transport Requirements 
 
   Transport-1: SIP clients MUST support UDP transport of SIP messages. 
    
   Transport-2: SIP clients MUST support TCP transport of SIP messages. 
    
   Transport-3: SIP devices MAY support RSVP (RFC 2205).

2.4 SIP User Agent Services 
    
   The requirements listed in this section may be used for device 
   testing. To verify correct functionality for specific services, the 
   support for the requirements in the next section should be tested. 
   The various call features listed here are also described in detail 
   in the SIP Service Examples [5]. 
    
   SIP-1: SIP telephony devices MUST support RFC 3261 [2].  
       
   SIP-2, DNS SRV: SIP clients MUST support RFC 3263 [6] for locating a 
   SIP Server and select a transport protocol using NAPTR. When making 
   a SRV query, the client MUST use the additional information in the 
   response that contains the IP addresses for the A records.  
         
   If the DNS additional information is not present, the client MUST   
   make DNS A record queries to resolve the hostnames.  
       
   SIP-3, Do Not Disturb: Users MUST be able to set the state of the 
   device to Do Not Disturb (DND). 
    
   The change of the DND state SHOULD be communicated in a PUBLISH with 
   a tuple for this device to a configured presence server. 
    
   Re-invite: Clients MUST respond to new INVITES with a ô486 Busy 
   Hereö. Clients MUST respond to re-INVITES on existing dialogs as 
   normal behavior.     
    
   SIP-4, call hold resume: SIP clients MUST follow RFC 3264 [7] when 
   placing a call on hold. More specifically, the a=sendonly attribute 
   MUST be used. The SDP answer of SIP clients that are being placed on 
   hold MUST NOT contain "held" SDP, unless the user session was 
   originally on hold.  
       
   SIP-5, multiple calls: SIP clients that support call on hold MUST be 
   able to support at least two or more calls.  By placing the current 
   call ôon holdö, the client MUST be able to initiate or receive 
   another call.  
       
   SIP-6, call waiting indicator: SIP clients MUST support a call   
   waiting indicator.  When already participating in a call, the user   
   MUST be alerted audibly and/or visually of another incoming call. 
   The user MUST be able to enable/disable call waiting.  
       

                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                    [Page 6] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   SIP-7, message waiting indicator: SIP clients MUST support SIP 
   message waiting [8] and the integration with voicemail platforms.    
    
   SIP-8, local dial plan: SIP clients MAY support a local dial plan.   
   The dial plan MUST consist of a pattern string to match dial digits, 
   and the ability to strip, append prefix digits, and/or append suffix 
   digits and send messages directly to another SIP device, bypassing   
   the proxy.  
    
   Note: Mobile SIP phones or PCs may not need a dial plan. 
   When using URL's and calling in the local domain, the local domain 
   (@domain) MAY be appended to facilitate calling. 
    
   If the destination SIP device is specified as an IP address, the SIP 
   client MUST not attempt to resolve the address with DNS as specified 
   in RFC 3263 [6].   
    
   If the destination SIP device is a string value, the SIP client MUST 
   make normal DNS SRV and A record queries as specified in RFC 3263.  
       
   SIP-9, transfer: SIP devices MUST support REFER and NOTIFY as 
   required to support the transfer [9]. SIP clients MUST support 
   escaped headers in the Refer-To: header.  
       
   SIP-10, unattended transfer: SIP devices MUST support an unattended   
   transfer. SIP clients MUST support escaped headers in the Refer-To: 
   header.  
       
   SIP-11, attended call transfer: SIP devices MUST support attended 
   call transfer. SIP clients MUST support escaped headers in the 
   Refer-To: header.  
       
   SIP-12, device based conferencing: SIP devices MAY be able to 
   support device based conferencing. A SIP client MAY be able to 
   initiate and mix the audio streams of at least 2 separate calls 
   (i.e. 3 way conference calling).  
       
   SIP-13, DMTF in-band mixing: SIP devices MUST generate in-band DTMF   
   tones for use with the G.711 codec.  
       
   SIP-14: DTMF RTP payload: SIP clients MUST be able to send DTMF   
   specified by RFC 2833 [10]. 
    
   RFC 2833 negotiation must behave as follows: Receiving endpoint must 
   reply with payload type sent by initiator. For example, if the 
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                    [Page 7] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   initiating client sends payload type 101, receiving endpoint must 
   reply with payload type 101.    
     
   Payload type negotiation MUST comply with RFC 3264.  
       
   Payload type MUST remain constant throughout the session. For 
   example, if an endpoint decides to renegotiate codecs or put the 
   call on hold, the payload type for the re-invite MUST be the same as 
   initial payload type. SIP devices SHOULD support Flow Identification 
   (FID) as defined in RFC 3388 [11]. 
       
   SIP-15, 180 ignores earlier media: SIP devices MUST generate local   
   ringing and MUST ignore any early RTP media when a ô180 Ringingö 
   response is received.  
       
   SIP-16, play single early media stream: SIP devices MUST play the   
   first RTP stream and ignore any other RTP media streams when a ô183   
   Session Progressö response is received.  
       
   SIP-17, use the last 18x message received: SIP devices MUST obey the 
   last 18x message received when multiple 18x responses are received.   
    
   If the last response is ô180 Ringingö; the client MUST generate 
   local ringing. If the last response is ô183 Session Progressö; the 
   client MUST play the RTP stream.  
       
   SIP-18, error-info support: SIP devices MUST support the Error-Info   
   header.  
       
   SIP-19, reason phrase display: If the ôReason Phraseö of a response   
   message is displayed, the client MUST use ôReason Phraseö in the   
   response packet.  
    
   The client MAY use an internal ôStatus Codeö table if there was a 
   problem with the language negotiation.     
       
   SIP-20, fax support: SIP adapter devices (for analog phone lines)   
   MUST support the ITU-T T.38 standard [12] using UDPTL [13]. SIP 
   devices MUST fallback to G.711 if T.38 fails. 
    
                          Multi-line Requirements 
    
   SIP-21, multi-line support: Multi-line SIP devices MUST register 
   using more than one set of credentials.  
       
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                    [Page 8] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   SIP-22, multi-line Do Not Disturb: SIP multi-line devices MUST be 
   able to set the state of the client to Do Not Disturb on a per line 
   basis.  
   Clients MUST respond to new INVITES with a ô486 Busy Hereö. Clients   
   MUST respond to re-INVITES on existing dialogs as normal.   
       
   SIP-23, multi-line call waiting indicator: Multi-line SIP devices 
   MUST support multi-line call waiting indicators.  When already 
   participating in a call, the user MUST be alerted audibly and/or 
   visually of another incoming call. This setting MUST be provisioned 
   by the user. 
     
   SIP devices with multiple identities (ie. registrations/lines) MUST 
   allow Call Waiting Indicator to be set on a per identity basis. If   
   call waiting is set for an identity, the client MUST respond with   
   ô486 Busy Hereö when an incoming call to that identity is received   
   and the client has an existing call with any of the identities. 
     
       
   SIP-24, Dynamic login/logout for user mobility: SIP devices SHOULD 
   support user mobility.  SIP clients MAY store a static profile in 
   non-volatile memory so that this information is available during the 
   power up sequence. SIP clients MAY allow a user to walk up to a 
   client, login, and be able to send and receive calls with his/her 
   profile information. 
     
   For emergency numbers (e.g. 911, SOS URL) the client MUST send the 
   credentials username/password) of the static profile.  
       
   SIP-25, multi-line ring tones: SIP devices MUST be able to provision   
   a different ring tone for each line (i.e. registration or static 
   identity). 
    
         Analog text support for hearing or speech disabled users 
    
   SIP-26, analogue and digital text support for hearing and speech 
   impaired users: As per RFC 3351 [14], communicating with legacy 
   relay services and devices. 
    
   SIP adapter devices (for analog phone lines) supporting conversion 
   between real time text transmission using RFC 2793 [15] and analog 
   text telephones according to ITU-T V.18 MUST allow alternating use 
   of text and voice. SIP clients MUST fallback to G.711 if the RFC 
   2793 connection fails.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   SIP devices must support TCP as specified in RFC 3261 for longer 
   text messages. 
    
   Digital text support: SIP telephone devices MAY support real time 
   text conversation using RFC 2793 for the text stream. It MUST be 
   possible to use text simultaneously with voice. 
    
   Note: Though SIP telephony devices supporting Instant Messaging 
   based on the SIMPLE [21] standard allow text conversation based on 
   blocks of text. However, interactive text conversation is required 
   for hearing and speech disabled users due to its streaming-like 
   nature. 
    
    
   SIP-27, call-info: SIP devices with a display MUST support the call-
   info header and depending on the display capabilities MAY for 
   example display an icon or the image of the caller. 
    
   SIP-28, Priority header: SIP devices SHOULD support the Priority 
   header for such applications as emergency calls or for selective 
   call acceptance. 
    
   SIP-29: SIP devices MUST support music on hold as shown in "SIP 
   Service Examples" [5]. 
    
   SIP-30: SIP devices SHOULD support the OPTION method as per RFC 
   3261. 
    
2.5 Support for SIP Services 
 
   SIP devices used for enterprise communications SHOULD support the 
   call flows for the basic and enhanced SIP services. The list here 
   MAY be used for system integration testing to support specific 
   commercial services. 
    
   The schema for uploading the identity from a PDA is outside the        
   scope of these requirements. 
    
   The call flows illustrated in the references shown below assure not 
   only minimal support for SIP phones, as required for PSTN-style  
   consumer services, but also for the most widely used Centrex-style 
   and PBX-style services. 
    


                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 10] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   3rd party call control enables many value added services, such as 
   standards based control of a SIP phone from a call manager 
   application on the PC collocated on the desk with the SIP phone. 
    
   The following IETF references for rich presence, instant messaging, 
   caller preferences and service mobility specify SIP specific 
   services that go beyond the capability of PSTN and PBX based 
   services and can be best supported by SIP telephony devices. 
    
   Srv-1: SIP Call Flow Examples [16], 
    
   Srv-2: SIP Service Examples [17], 
    
   Srv-3: PSTN call flows [18], 
    
   Srv-4: Third Party Call Control in SIP [19], 
    
   Srv-5: SIP call control and multiparty features [20], 
    
   Srv-6: SIP devices MAY support conferencing services [21] for voice 
   and IM [22], so as to be able act as host for a 3-way conference at 
   least. 
    
   Srv-7: Rich Presence based services [23], 
    
   Srv-8: Caller and called party preferences [24], 
    
   Srv-9: Service mobility: SIP desk devices MAY allow roaming users to 
   upload their identity so as to have access to their services and       
   preferences from the home SIP server. Examples of user data to be 
   available for roaming users are: User service ID, the dialing plan, 
   personal directory and caller/called party preferences. 

2.6 SIP and Other Related Protocols 

 
   SDP: SIP devices MUST support Session Description Protocol, RFC2327   
   [25].  
       
   RTP/RTCP: SIP devices MUST support Real-Time Protocol and Real-Time   
   Control Protocol, RFC 1889. SIP devices SHOULD use RTCP Extended 
   Reports for logging and reporting on network support for voice 
   quality [26]. 
    
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 11] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   SIP clients MUST support Simple Network Time Protocol (RFC2030), or 
   use the Date: header of the 200 OK in response to a REGISTER 
   request. 
    
                            Network Management 
    
   SNMP: SIP clients SHOULD support SNMP reporting.  SIP clients SHOULD 
   support the RTP and RTCP MIBs to report jitter, delay, and packet 
   loss. 
        
2.7 SIP Security 
     
   Sec-1: SIP devices MUST support digest authentication as per RFC 
   3261. 
    
   Sec-2: SIP devices MUST be able to password protect configuration 
   information and administrative functions. 
    
   Sec-3: SIP devices MUST not display the password to the user or 
   administrator after it has been entered.  
    
   Sec-4: SIP clients MUST be able to disable remote access, i.e. block 
   incoming SNMP, HTTP, and other services not necessary for basic 
   operation. 
    
   Sec-5: SIP clients MUST be able to reject an incoming INVITE where 
   the user-portion of the SIP request URI is blank or does not match a 
   provisioned Contact. The setting to accept/reject MUST be 
   provisioned. 
    
   Sec-6: SIP clients MUST be able to reject an incoming INVITE when 
   the message does not come from the proxy or proxies where the client 
   is registered.  For DNS SRV specified proxy addresses, the client 
   must accept an INVITE from all of the resolved proxy IP addresses. 
     
2.8 Voice Codecs 
     
   Internet telephony devices face the problem of supporting multiple   
   codecs due to various historic reasons, on how telecom industry 
   players have approached codec implementations and the serious 
   intellectual property and licensing problems associated with most 
   codec types.  
    
   Many, but not all voice codec payload types are described in RFC 
   1890 [27].   
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 12] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
       
   Codec-1: Three main classes of voice codecs are supported by 
   Internet telephony devices; (1) default G.711, (2) compressed and 
   (3) wideband. At least two codecs, the default G.711 codec and one 
   compressed codec listed below MUST be supported. 
       
   1. SIP telephony devices MUST support AVT payload type 0 (G.711 
   uLaw] as the default codec. The packet size MUST be 20 milliseconds. 
   The matching ITU-T Appendix I and Appendix II decoders SHOULD also 
   be supported.  
       
   2. The compressed Internet Low Bit Rate codec (iLBC) [28], [29] MUST 
   be supported.  
    
   Other compressed codecs SHOULD be supported. Compressed Voice codecs 
   used in 2nd and 3rd generation mobile phone systems, such as various 
   GSM codecs are also found in various implementations and SHOULD be 
   supported.  
    
   The narrow bandwidth codecs such as G.723.1 with such low speed as 
   5.3 kb/s and 6.3 kb/s (without RTP/UDP/IP overhead) as to work well 
   even on dial-up access MAY be supported.   
    
   Compressed codecs such as G.729 derived from delta-PCM encoding, 
   found in networks with frugal Internet access bandwidth using frame 
   relay or DSL access MAY be supported.   
        
   3. Wideband codecs using typically 16 kHz voice sampling for better-
   than-PSTN voice quality, such as G.722 and other MAY be supported. 
   Such codecs are found in conferencing systems to increase the 
   perceived quality of conferencing.  
       
   Note: A summary count reveals up to 25 and more voice codec types 
   currently in use. The authors believe there is a need for a single 
   multi-rate Internet codec, such as [30] that can effectively be 
   substituted for all the multiple codec types listed here and avoid 
   the complexity and cost implementers and service providers alike are 
   faced by supporting so many codec types, including especially those 
   that have not been developed specifically for Internet use.   
       
   Codec-2, codec negotiation: Endpoints MUST follow these guidelines 
   in   RFC 3264: Initiator specifies "preferred" codec and the 
   receiver has "final" choice of codec selected.  
       
   Both endpoints MUST use the first codec listed by the receiver.  
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 13] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
       
   If an endpoint cannot dynamically switch between available codecs, 
   it MUST offer a single codec and send a new INVITE with another 
   codec if the original fails due to the SIP 488 "Media Unsupported" 
   message.  
       
   Codec-3, comfort noise: SIP devices MAY support comfort noise 
   generated in the receiver, without using up end-to-end bandwidth. It 
   is also RECOMMENDED that SIP clients comply with performance 
   specified for the "handset receive comfort noise" requirements 
   outlined in the ANSI/EIA/TIA-810-A-2000 standard. 
      
2.9 Voice-Telephony Requirements     
    
   Voice-1, loudness: SIP telephony devices MUST conform to the 
   electro- acoustical requirements for send loudness rating (SLR), 
   receive loudness rating (RLR), weighted terminal coupling loss 
   (TCLw), stability loss, etc.) of the TIA/EIA standards [31], and 
   [32].  
       
   Stability loss is a measure of the contribution of the telephone set   
   or terminal to the overall connection stability requirements.   
   Stability loss is defined as the minimum loss from the terminal   
   digital input (receive) to the terminal digital output (transmit), 
   at any test frequency.    
       
   Voice-2, stability loss: SIP device SHOULD meet the following   
   stability loss requirements. 
      
   The stability or minimum loss, per ITU-T G.177, TIA/EIA-810-A and 
   TIA/EIA-579-A, at any voice-band frequency SHOULD be greater than 6 
   dB, and preferably greater than 10 dB. Digital telephone sets or 
   terminal equipment with adjustable receive level SHOULD maintain 
   stability over the entire range of adjustable receive levels.  
       
   Voice-3, speakerphone: SIP devices MAY provide a full-duplex 
   speakerphone with echo and side-tone cancellation.  
       
   Voice-4, programmable ring-tones: SIP device MAY be able to use   
   different ring-tones based on the caller identity (i.e. From: 
   header). 
       
2.10 International Requirements

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   International-1, language support: SIP devices SHOULD indicate the 
   preferred language using SIP Caller Preferences. The setting for 
   this header MUST be provisioned.  
       
   International-2, international display support: SIP devices intended 
   to be used in various language settings, MUST support other 
   languages for menus, help, and labels. 
        
2.11 Support for Applications  
    
   The following requirements apply to functions placed in the SIP 
   telephony device.  
       
   App-1, SIMPLE Integration: SIP devices that support presence MUST 
   provide a buddy list and use SIP extensions to leverage presence 
   [33]. 
     
   App-2, address-book integration: SIP devices SHOULD allow a 3rd 
   party to initiate a call for the client, such as using the address 
   book in the PC to initiate a call. 
    
   App-3, LDAP phonebook: SIP devices MAY support LDAP for client-based   
   directory lookup.  
    
   App-4, automatic ring-down: SIP devices MAY support a phone setup 
   where a URL is automatically dialed when the client goes off-hook.  
       
   App-5, hold ring-back: SIP devices MAY ring after a call has been on   
   hold for a predetermined period of time, typically 3 minutes. This   
   time value MUST be provisioned. 
    
2.12 Web-based Feature Management 
        
   Web-1: SIP devices SHOULD support an internal web server to allow 
   users to manually configure the phone and to set up personal phone 
   services such as the address book, speed-dial, ringer tones, and 
   last but not least the call handling options for the various lines, 
   aliases, in a user friendly fashion. Web pages to manage the SIP 
   telephony device MAY be supported by the individual device, or in 
   managed networks from   centralized web servers. Managing SIP 
   telephony devices SHOULD NOT require special client software on the 
   PC or on a management console.  
       
   Web-2: The telephone settings MAY be accessible to authenticated   
   users or operations personnel from remote locations.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
2.13 Firmware Update 
       
   Firm-1: SIP devices MUST be able to upgrade their firmware as 
   described in section 3.  
    
2.14 Firewall/NAT Traversal 
        
   The following requirements allow SIP clients to properly function 
   behind various firewall architectures. 
     
   FW/NAT-1, outbound proxy support: SIP devices MUST support a default   
   domain used for NAT traversal. SIP devices MUST have the capability 
   to be configured so that the default domain and the outbound SIP 
   proxy are different.   
    
   The provisioned user identity on the device MUST include a full URL 
   to be included in the SIP From: header or a provisioned domain name 
   MUST be appended.  
       
     Configuration Information  
     
     Name: userA  
     Proxy Address: sip.outbound.domain.com  
     Domain: domain.com  
       
     Example Message sent to sip.outbound.domain.com  
       
     REGISTER sip:domain.com SIP/2.0   
     To: sip:userA@domain.com   
     From: sip:userA@domain.com   
     Contact: sip:10.10.10.215  
       
   FW/NAT-2, NAT capable configuration: SIP devices MUST be able to 
   operate behind a static NAT/PAT (Network Address Translation/Port 
   Address Translation) device using the STUN protocol [34]. SIP 
   clients MUST be able to populate SIP messages with the public, 
   external address of the NAT/PAT device and use specific port ranges 
   for RTP.  
       
   FW/NAT-3, UPnP capable configuration: SIP devices MAY be able to 
   operate with a UPnP (http://www.upnp.org/) firewall device. UPnP 
   will support the traversal of the local NAT/FW and is adequate on 
   its own when no other NATs are placed in the service provider 
   network.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   FW/NAT-4, STUN capable configuration: SIP telephony devices MUST be 
   able to operate with a STUN server. 
        
2.15 Device Interfaces 
       
   SIP telephony devices MAY have various types of interfaces, such as   
   resembling a desktop phone, cordless phone, mobile phone, handheld   
   computer, laptop computer and MAY have various interface models, 
   such as for phones, IM GUI or personal organizer. Given the variety 
   of possible interfaces, the generic requirements only can be listed 
   here.  
       
   Int-1: SIP telephony devices MUST have a telephony-like dial-pad and 
   MAY have telephony style buttons like mute, redial, transfer, 
   conference, hold, etc.  
       
   Int-2: SIP telephony devices MUST have a convenient way for entering  
   SIP URLs and phone numbers.  This includes all alphanumeric 
   characters allowed in legal SIP URLs. Possible approaches include 
   using a web page, display and keyboard entry or graffiti for PDAs.  
       
   Phone number entry SHOULD be supported in human friendly fashion, by   
   allowing the usual separators and brackets between digits and digit   
   groups.    
       
   Int-3: SIP telephony devices MUST have two types of interface   
   capabilities, for both phone numbers and URLs, both accessible to 
   the end user.  
       
   1. SIP device configuration and management interface:  
    
   SIP telephony adapters and high end phones MAY support SNMP v.3 for 
   managing the device. The required MIB is outside the scope of this 
   memo. 
    
   The access to the SIP device configuration interface MAY be blocked 
   by the service provider so as not allow misconfiguration of the 
   settings.  
    
   2. End user options interface: Such as personal address book, auto- 
   forwarding, ringer tones, etc.  
       
   Desktop and other phone-style SIP devices can meet the above   
   requirements with a device web page. Device web pages may also 

                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 17] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   facilitate remote device settings from a help desk, without user 
   intervention.      
    
3. Automatic Configuration  
 
   Automatic SIP telephony device configuration SHOULD use the 
   processes and requirements described in [35] and [36]. 
    
   The user name or the realm in the domain name SHOULD be used by the 
   configuration server to automatically configure the device for 
   individual or group specific settings, without any settings by the 
   user. 
    
   Image and service data upgrades SHOULD also not require any settings 
   by the user. 
    
   4. Configuration Settings     
    
   Besides network parameters, SIP telephony devices MAY also be 
   configured with user data described here.  
       
   Settings are the information on a client that it needs to be a   
   functional SIP endpoint. It is an implementation choice whether the 
   device stores the data across power cycles and hardware restarts or 
   it reloads the data every time upon startup. The settings defined in 
   this document are not intended to be all inclusive. It MUST be 
   possible for vendor specific parameters to be added. Parameters 
   which are not understood by an end point MUST be ignored.    
    
   The list of available configuration settings includes settings that  
   MUST, SHOULD or MAY be used by all devices (when present) and that 
   make up the common denominator that is used and understood by all 
   devices. However, the list is open to vendor specific extensions 
   that support additional settings, which enable a rich and valuable 
   set of features.  
        
   Settings MAY be read-only on the device. This avoids the 
   misconfiguration of important settings by inexperienced users 
   generating service cost for operators. This draft describes how 
   operator MAY protect some settings from end users.   
       
   In order to achieve wide adoption of any configuration settings 
   format it is important that it not be excessive in size so as to 
   allow modest devices to use it. Any format SHOULD be structured 
   enough to allow flexible extensions to it by vendors.   
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 18] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
       
   Settings may belong to the device or to a line. When the endpoint   
   acts in the context of a line, it will first try to look up a 
   setting in the line context. If the setting can not be found in that 
   context, the device will try to find the setting in the device 
   context. If that also fails, the device MAY use a default value for 
   the setting.  
       
   The line concept allows configuration of phones in a user specific   
   context. It simplifies unconstrained seating in offices, can support 
   roaming users and allows users to subscribe to more than one service 
   provider.  
       
   In principle, all settings MAY be present in line and in device 
   context. For some settings (e.g. the MAC address of the device), 
   devices MAY set restrictions on the availability of settings in 
   either line or device context. 
        
4.1 Device ID 
                      
   A device setting MAY include some unique identifier for the device 
   it represents. This MAY be an arbitrary device name chosen by the 
   user, the MAC address, some manufacturer serial number or some other 
   unique piece of data.        
    
4.2 Network Related Settings                   
 
   Network-1: SIP Ports. The port that MUST be used for a specific   
   transport protocol MAY be indicated with the SIP ports setting. If 
   this setting is omitted, the device MAY choose any port.    
       
   Network-2: Quality of Service. The Quality of Service settings for 
   outbound packets SHOULD be configurable for network packets   
   associated with call signaling (SIP) and media transport (RTP/RTCP). 
   These settings help network operators identifying voice packets in 
   their network and allow them to transport them with the necessary 
   quality. The settings are independently configurable for the 
   different transport layers and signaling, media or administration. 
           
   For both categories of network traffic, the device SHOULD permit   
   configuration of the type of service settings for both layer 3 (IP   
   DiffServ) and layer 2 (IEEE 802.1D/Q) of the network protocol stack.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   Network-3: Network parameters. The parameters for SIP (like timer 
   T1) and other network related settings MAY be indicated. An example 
   of usage would be the reduction of the DNS SRV failover time.  
           
   Network-4: RTP Port range. A range of port numbers MUST be used by a 
   device for the consecutive pairs of ports which MUST be used to 
   receive audio and control information (RTP and RCTP) for each 
   concurrent connection. This is required to support firewall 
   traversal. This again helps network operators to identify voice 
   packets and makes it possible to configure port ranges on firewalls 
   only for voice packets.   
            
   Network-5: Registration period. A line definition MAY contain a 
   period (in seconds) which once exceeded will cause the device to re-
   register its registration server(s). The default value is one hour.  
       
   Network-6: Default Call Handling. All of the call handling settings   
   defined below in section 5.3.2 can be defined here as default   
   behaviors.   
       
   Network-7: Outbound Proxy. The outbound proxy for a line or for a   
   device MUST be set. The address is encoded as SIP URI. The setting 
   MAY contain alternative outbound proxies, which MAY be used in case 
   of a server failure. 
    
   Using this setting, private networks can control outbound traffic 
   and send it through an application layer gateway.   
           
   Network-8: Default Outbound Line. The default outbound line SHOULD 
   be a global setting (not related to a specific line). This setting 
   MUST not be used as part of a line definition.  
    
   Network-9: SIP Session Timer. The re-invite timer allows user agents 
   to detect broken sessions caused by network failures. A value 
   indicating the number of seconds for the next re-invite SHOULD be 
   used if provided. If there is no value provided, the device MAY use 
   a default value (e.g. 3600 seconds). 
    
4.3 Address Completion 
           
   As most telephone users are used to dialing digits to indicate the   
   address of the destination, there is a need for specifying the rule   
   by which digits are transformed into a URL (usually SIP URL or TEL 
   URL).   
           
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 20] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   Dial-1: SIP phones need to understand entries into the phone book of 
   the most common separators used between dialed digits, such as 
   spaces, angle and round brackets, dash and dots.  
    
   Dial-2: Dial Plan and/or Dial/OK key. A dial plan which defines the 
   maximum expected length of a typical telephone number MAY be used. 
   If no dial plan is used, the device MAY have a "Dial" or "OK" key, 
   similar to mobile phones.  
           
   Zero or more digit maps which map a dial plan and a SIP address to   
   which phone numbers of that type SHOULD be routed to SHOULD be 
   supported. The digit maps define numeric patterns that when matched 
   define: 
      
   1) A rule by which the end point can judge that the user has      
   completed dialing, and   
   2) A rule to construct a URL from the dialed digits, and optionally   
   3) An outbound proxy to be used in routing the SIP INVITE.   
           
   A critical timer MAY be provided which determines how long the 
   device SHOULD wait before dialing if a dial plan contains a T 
   character. It MAY also provide a timer for the maximum elapsed time 
   which SHOULD pass before dialing if the digits entered by the user 
   match no dial plan.   
           
   Dial-3: Default Digit Map. The end point SHOULD support the   
   configuration of a default digit map. If the end point does not   
   support digit maps, it SHOULD at least support a default digit map 
   rule to construct a URL from digits. If the end point does support 
   digit maps, this rule applies if none of the digit maps match.       
       
   Dial-4: Overlap-Dial. Some operators support overlap dialing and   
   MAY want to indicate to the SIP devices that this mode is to be 
   used. This setting is Boolean and MAY be set to true or false. 
            
4.4 Audio      
 
   Audio-1: Codecs. In some cases operators want to control which 
   codecs MAY be used in their network. The desired subset of codecs 
   supported by the device MUST be configurable along with the order of 
   preference. Service providers MUST have the possibility of plugging 
   in their own codecs of choice.   
           


                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 21] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   The range for parameters of the codecs MUST be adjustable. This   
   includes the packet length (ms of audio), which is a function of  
   the sample rate.  
   However, the negotiation of the media for individual calls is being   
   done on a per call basis.  
     
   Audio-2: DTMF method. DTMF allows different ways of indicating that 
   a key has been pressed as per RFC 2833. The method for sending these 
   events SHOULD be configurable with the order of precedence.   
           
   Audio-3: Silence suppression. It SHOULD be possible to disable   
   silence suppression on the end point such that RTP audio packets are   
   sent even if silence is detected. 
             
4.5 Local and Regional Parameters      
    
   Certain settings are dependent upon the devices regional location,   
   such as the daylight saving time rules and the time zone.   
           
   Regional-1: Time Zone. A time zone MAY be specified for the user.   
   Where one is specified; it SHOULD use the scheme used by the Olson 
   Time One database [37]. Examples of the database naming scheme are   
   Asia/Dubai or America/Los Angeles where the first part of the name 
   is the continent or ocean and the second part is normally the 
   largest city on that time-zone.  
       
   Regional-2: UTC Offset. An offset from Coordinated Universal Time 
   (UTC) in seconds MAY be used.          
       
   Different rules exist for when daylight saving time (DST) starts and   
   ends. For example in North America begins on the first Sunday in   
   April whereas in Western Europe is begins on the last Sunday in 
   March.   
       
   Regional-3: A DST rule MAY be used by the device.   
       
   The network addresses of SNTP (RFC 2030) time servers where the 
   device can get a centrally defined time value MAY be used.   
       
   Regional-4: The time server MAY be used. DHCP is the preferred way 
   to provide this setting. Setting the correct language is important 
   for simple installation around the globe.  
           


                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 22] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   Language-1: Language settings MAY be deployed. A language MAY be   
   specified for a device. Where it is specified it SHOULD use the 
   codes defined in RFC3066 [38] to provide some predictability.   
           
   Language-2: It is RECOMMENDED that servers set the Language as   
   writable, so that the user MAY change this. This setting SHOULD NOT   
   be line related. 
    
   Language-3: A SIP UA MUST be able to parse and accept requests 
   containing international characters encoded as UTF-8 even if it 
   canÆt display those characters in the user interface. 
               
4.6 Inbound authentication     
    
   SIP allows a device to limit incoming signaling to those made by a   
   predefined set of authorized users from a list and/or with valid 
   passwords.       
     
   In-Auth-1: A device SHOULD support the setting as to whether 
   authentication (on the device) is required and what type of 
   authentication is REQUIRED: NONE or DIGEST.      
       
   In-Auth-2: If inbound authentication is enabled then a list of 
   allowed users and credentials to call this device MAY be used by the 
   device. The credentials MAY contain the same data as the credentials 
   for a line (i.e. URL, user, password digest and realm). This applies 
   to SIP control signaling as well as call initiation. The list shows 
   for example who is allowed to send a REFER or an INVITE with the 
   Join or Replaces header. 
       
4.7 Voice mail settings 
       
   Various voice mail settings require the use of URL's as specified in   
   [39].   
       
   VM-1: The message waiting indicator (MWI) address setting controls 
   where the client MAY SUBSCRIBE to a voice mail server [40].   
           
   VM-2: A retrieve address MAY be used by the device so it can get any   
   voicemail messages it has.   
       
   VM-3: A deposit address MAY be used to specify where voicemail 
   messages SHOULD be left if the device is unable or unwilling to take 
   a call.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
4.8 Phonebook and Call History 
          
   IP Telephony devices can store locally a phonebook and also the   
   history of recent calls. As an alternative, phonebook directory 
   servers can provide a centralized store of phone numbers/addresses 
   and potentially other information, such as provided by LDAP 
   directory servers.   
       
   Phonebook-1: SIP telephony devices MAY store telephone book entries   
   locally and/or MAY use a central LDAP directory.  
       
   A record of the last calls made and received MAY also be stored   
   locally or in a centralized location and referenced from devices.   
       
   Call Hisytory-1: SIP telephony devices MAY store locally a recent   
   (limited) call history or MAY make use of a central server for call   
   history. If the phone maintains only one last dialed number, it 
   SHOULD compare the incoming Last-Calls header against tried and 
   dialed and store the newest entry.   
    
   Devices that are not able to differentiate call history entries   
   between "tried" and "dialed" SHOULD use "dialed".   
           
   A server MAY be used for storing the phonebook and call history.   
       
   PhoneServers-1: Zero or more servers MAY be used for storing   
   phonebook directories or call histories. If a server is defined and   
   address such as a URL MUST be used and user name and credentials MAY   
   be used for that server.   
       
   The flush timeout MAY be specified for the server.      
       
   Users MAY wish to limit the number of data items that are returned 
   to their device if a query is issued against one of the directory   
   servers.         
    
4.9 Ringer Behavior      
      
   The manner in which a user is alerted to an incoming call (visually,   
   audibly or possibly both) MAY be used by the device. This includes   
   the different volumes and MAY point to a file that contains the   
   melody for the ringer alert.       
       
   Ringer sound files MAY be specified for the following types of   
   incoming calls normal, high priority, internal and external.  
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 24] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   Different ringer sound files MAY also be associated with different   
   lines.  
    
   The location of a call MAY also be indicated. This allows using the 
   phone by hearing-impaired or in noisy environments where external 
   speakers are used to render the sound. The location of the call is 
   also useful for paging by speakerphones. 
      
4.10 User Related Settings and Roaming 
     
   A device MAY specify the user which is currently registered on the   
   device. This SHOULD be an address-of-record URL specified in a line   
   definition.   
           
   The purpose of specifying which user is currently assigned to this   
   device is to provide the device with the identity of the user whose   
   settings are defined in the user section. This is primarily 
   interesting with regards to user roaming. Devices MAY allow users to 
   sign-on to them and then request that their particular settings be 
   retrieved. Likewise a user MAY stop using a device and want to 
   disable their lines while not present. For the device to understand 
   what to do it MUST have some way of identifying users and knowing 
   which user is currently using it. By separating the user and device 
   properties it becomes clear what the user wishes to enable or to 
   disable.     
    
   Providing an identifier in the configuration for the user gives an   
   explicit handle for the user. For this to work the device MUST have   
   some way of identifying users and knowing which user is currently   
   assigned to it.      
           
   One possible scenario for roaming is an agent who has definitions 
   for several lines (e.g. one or more personal lines and one for each 
   executive for whom the administrator takes calls) that they are 
   registered for. If the agent goes to the copy room they would sign-
   on to a device in that room and their user settings including their 
   lines would roam with them.  The alternative to this is to require 
   the agent to individually configure all of the lines individually 
   (this would be particularly irksome using standard telephone button 
   entry).   
           
   The management of user profiles, aggregation of user or device lines   
   and profile information from multiple management sources are   
   configuration server concerns which are out of the scope of this   
   document. However the ability to uniquely identify the device and 
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 25] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   user within the configuration data enables easier server based as 
   well as local (i.e. on the device) configuration management of the 
   configuration data.   
       
   UserID-1:  User ID MAY be specified. If the user ID is specified, 
   the address-of-record URL MAY be specified for the line definition. 
               
4.11 Line Related Settings 
    
   SIP telephony devices MUST use the line related settings, as 
   specified here. 
        
4.12 Line Identification                  
    
   A line represents an address-of-record identified by a URL.   
   There are many properties which MAY be associated with or SHOULD be   
   applied to the line or signaling addressed to or from the line. 
   Lines   MAY be defined for a device or a user of the device. At 
   least one   line MUST be defined in the configuration settings, this 
   MAY pertain to either the device itself or the user.    
           
   A line MUST provide a address or record URL which both distinguishes   
   the line and provides the URL which optionally will be registered 
   for the line. A user friendly display name SHOULD be taken from the   
   address-or-record URL for the line.    
           
   A line definition MUST specify whether the line SHOULD automatically   
   register with a registration server. It MUST be possible to specify   
   at least one set of realm, user name and authentication credentials   
   for each line. The user name and authentication credentials are used   
   upon authentication challenges.    
           
   A line definition MUST use call handling settings and the state of   
   the phone to determine how to handle inbound calls. Inbound calls 
   MAY be rejected, redirected, or accepted. 
         
4.13 Registration period 
             
   A line definition MAY contain a period (in seconds) which once 
   exceeded will cause the device to re-register its registration  
   server(s). The default time is one hour. 
         
4.14 Maximum connections 
         

                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 26] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   A setting defining the maximum number of simultaneous connections   
   that a device can support MUST be used by the device. Obviously the   
   end point has some maximum limit, most likely determined by the 
   media   handling capability. The number of simultaneous connections 
   may be also limited by the access bandwidth, such as of DSL, cable 
   and wireless users.  
       
   MaxConn-1: A SIP telephony device MAY support at least two   
   connections for three-way conference calls that are locally hosted. 
        
4.15 Call handling 
        
   Call Handling settings define how the phone reacts to a new incoming   
   call given different situations. In some cases, an end user MAY want   
   to redirect calls to another party, rejected the call, or accept the 
   call and alert the end user. Some settings tend to change 
   irregularly like their voicemail forwarding address while other 
   settings such as the Do Not Disturb state MAY change often. Private 
   networks and service provider networks MAY enable very sophisticated 
   call handling options that MAY be supported more effectively on SIP 
   servers, rather than in all SIP telephony devices. In such networks, 
   call handling options in the SIP telephony device MUST be disabled 
   to avoid feature interaction.  
       
   CallOptions-1: Local call handling options like forwarding, such as   
   to voice mail or other locations, available and busy behavior MUST   
   have the option of being disabled locally, in case these services 
   are   provided by a SIP server. 
             
4.16 Available Behavior 
             
   The Available Behavior defines how a new call is handled when the   
   phone is not actively engaged in a call or when Call Waiting is   
   enabled. Options include RING and FORWARD_ON_NO_ANSWER. A setting of   
   RING alerts the user (as defined by the Ringer Behavior in 3.2.3) 
   for   a practical length of time before returning an error response 
   to the caller if not answered.   
       
   Available-1: All end points MUST use an available behavior setting.  
       
   Available-2: FORWARD_ON_NO_ANSWER SHOULD alert the user for a   
   configured amount of time (Forward on No Answer Timeout) and if not   
   answered, forward to the Forward on No Answer address.

   The Forward on No Answer setting identifies the address forwarded 
   "To:" after an alerting call exceeds the Forward On No Answer 
   Timeout   period. End points MUST use this parameter if the 
   available behavior   is set to FORWARD ON NO ANSWER and MAY define 
   this parameter   otherwise.   
           
   The Forward on No Answer Timeout defines the length of time that a 
   user SHOULD be alerted for before the call is automatically redirect 
   to the Forward on no answer SIP URL. This parameter is specified in 
   seconds, where approximately 4 seconds is equivalent to a ring. End 
   points MUST use this parameter if the available behavior is set to 
   FORWARD ON NO ANSWER and MAY define this parameter otherwise. 
       
4.17 Busy Behavior  
                     
   The Busy Behavior defines how a new call is handled when the phone 
   is   engaged in an active call and call waiting is disabled or when 
   the   phone has reached the maximum number of connections. Options 
   include BUSY and FORWARD. A BUSY setting instructs the phone to 
   respond with a 486/Busy here. A FORWARD setting redirects the caller 
   to the Forward on Busy Address.   
       
   Busy-1: All SIP devices MUST use a busy behavior setting.   
           
   The Forward on Busy SIP URL setting identifies the address forwarded   
   to when the end point is busy. The end point is considered busy if a   
   call is active and call waiting is disabled and when the phone has   
   reached the maximum number of simultaneous connections. Since this   
   parameter is dependent on the busy behavior, end points MUST define   
   this setting if the BUSY behavior is set to FORWARD and MAY define   
   this setting otherwise. 
           
4.18 Call Waiting Behavior                     
    
   Call Waiting controls the behavior of new calls when an existing 
   call   is already active and the device has not met the maximum 
   number of   connections. Options include ALERT and BUSY, where ALERT 
   will alert   the user as defined by the Ringing behavior and 
   Available Behavior   and BUSY will follow the busy behavior logic. 
   All end points MUST use   a call waiting behavior setting.   
           
   Fwd-1, Unconditional Forwarding: The Unconditional Forwarding 
   setting   allows end users or administrators to forward all inbound 
   calls to a   designated Unconditional Forwarding SIP URL. This is 
   useful if one   wants to temporarily redirect all calls to another 
                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 28] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
   end point and administrative access to the directory servers is 
   unavailable.   
   Options include ENABLE and DISABLE, where ENABLE indicates that all   
   inbound calls will be redirected and DISABLE indicates that all   
   inbound calls will be treated as specified by the available, busy,   
   and call waiting behaviors. All end points MUST support 
   unconditional   forwarding.   
        
   The Unconditional Forwarding SIP URL identifies the address that 
   inbound calls are redirected to if Unconditional Forwarding is   
   enabled. All end points MUST use the unconditional forwarding 
   address if unconditional forwarding is enabled, otherwise they MAY 
   use it.  
            
4.19 Do Not Disturb 
             
   The Do Not Disturb setting enables end users to quickly and easily   
   enable and disable inbound calls for a particular line. Options   
   include ENABLE and DISABLE, where ENABLE will handle a call as 
   indicated by the Do Not Disturb Method and DISABLE allows normal 
   call handling. This setting MUST be used by all end points.   
           
   This setting MAY seem redundant to other parameters defined within 
   call handling, however, it addresses both an end user needs along 
   with administrative requirements. In some configurations, an end 
   point MAY be configured to return a BUSY response to an inbound call 
   so that a user agent within the network can try another party.  
   The same results are required for Do Not Disturb.   
           
   DND-1: Do Not Disturb Method MUST be able to support multiple 
   methods of rejecting calls. Options include BUSY, FORWARD_ON_BUSY, 
   and FORWARD_ON_NO_ANSWER. A setting of BUSY will return a BUSY 
   response   so that other network user agents can redirect the call 
   as needed.   
   FORWARD_ON_BUSY will redirect the call to the FORWARD_ON_BUSY SIP 
   URL and FORWARD_ON_NO_ANSWER will for privacy reasons allow the 
   caller to believe the call is alerting before forwarding to the 
   Forward on No Answer SIP URL.  
       
5. Examples of Configuration Data  
      
   The section describes the requirements and format for an 
   implementation of the settings described in section 4. 
        

                                                                         
                                                                         
        H. Sinnreich          Informational                   [Page 29] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         July 2003 
 
 
5.1. Requirements for Configuration Data Representation  
         
   From reading the preceding section 4, it is apparent that many of 
   the settings are composite and related. As the number and complexity 
   of the settings grows it is useful from an administration point of 
   view to be able to easily relate settings.   
           
   This document recognizes that as features multiply on devices, so   
   will the amount of settings. Any format proposed SHOULD be readily   
   and intuitively extensible.  
      
5.2 Configuration Data Format  
           
   The choices for the configuration data formats are best left to the   
   discretion of the implementers and service providers.  
    
   Open Issue: The authors believe it would be useful to specify a 
   grammar for the default name space. 
    
   This document illustrates however using XML as the file format for 
   the configuration settings primarily for the reasons stated above. 
   XML naturally maps the settings defined in section 4. 
    
   Note for potential grammar designers and implementers: The authors 
   believe it is very useful to have CDATA sections in XML documents 
   where the content itself may break XML syntax rules. This is the 
   case of SIP URLs. An example of is given in Example E below.   
           
   XML namespaces are a useful tool when processing documents which MAY   
   contain elements from more than one source. The default namespace 
   for any XML document using the definitions described in this 
   document MUST define the default namespace in the root node with a 
   URL.   
   Vendors MAY add their own content within the XML document but MUST   
   provide qualified names with their own namespace.   
           
   The general format for the XML data is to have device and user   
   elements as direct children of the root node. Those elements will   
   contain all of the appropriate settings describe in section 3.    
           
   An example of an extension to the time zone setting is show below.       
           
      <settings xmlnshttp://someurl   
      xmlns:acme=http://amce.com>   
           <device>

5.3 Format Definition 
          
   The definitions of the elements and attributes will not be included   
   in this version of the draft, given that only examples are shown 
   here. The examples follow to only illustrate some concepts of the 
   format. Section 4 defines the requirements from which the XML 
   elements and attributes will be derived. The authors believe the 
   data format definitions and grammar for SIP telephony device 
   configuration data SHOULD be the object of separate documents. 
                                                                
5.4 Handling of Unrecognized Element Names 
             
   The default rule is that any element with an unrecognized name is 
   ignored (i.e. having an unrecognized namespace URI, or an 
   unrecognized local name within that namespace). This includes all of 
   the element content, even if it appears to use recognized names. 
      
5.5 XML Configuration Data  
         
   This section aims to provide some samples of the settings defined in   
   section 4, using XML [41]. A complete grammar/schema definition is 
   not provided here, since this serves as an example only.

             <credential>   
             <callHandling>

                     <available behavior=forward-no-answer>   
                             <seconds>32<seconds>   
                             <url>sip:admin@acme.com</url>   
                     </available>                       
             </callHandling>   
        </line>   
           
   In this example the outbound proxy and call handling settings 
   defined in the line default settings example SHOULD be used in 
   addition to the line definition. 
     
   Note: The authors' preference for potentially long values in XML is 
   to use an element rather than an attribute.  Added to which, in an 
   element you can wrap values which would normally break the XML 
   syntax in a CDATA.  This would allow SIP URLs to be formatted 
   without having to escape them. 
    
   Example: 
    
   <line register=öprovisionö> 
   <aor-url><[!CDATA[ôExtension 123ö<sip:1234@Pingtel.com>]]</aor-url>

     1. Magic number(s): N/A    
     2. File extension(s): N/A    
     3. Macintosh file type code: N/A. 
     
7. Configuration Security  
    
   Please see also the above section 2.7 on SIP Security. 
    
   The device configuration MAY contain sensitive information that MUST 
   be protected. Examples include authentication information, private 
   address books and call history entries. Because of this, it is 
   RECOMMENDED to use an encrypted transport mechanism for 
   configuration data. Where devices use HTTP this could be TLS [42].   
   For devices which use FTP or TFTP for content delivery this can be   
   achieved using symmetric key encryption.    
           
   Access to retrieving configuration information is also an important   
   issue. A configuration server SHOULD challenge a subscriber before 
   sending configuration information.
