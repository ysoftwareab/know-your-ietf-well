Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5480 to specify semantics for the

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5480] specifies the syntax and semantics for the Subject Public
   Key Information field in certificates that support Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography.  As part of these semantics, it defines what
   combinations are permissible for the values of the key usage
   extension [RFC5280].  [RFC5480] specifies 7 of the 9 values; it
   makes no mention of keyEncipherment and dataEncipherment key usage
   bits.  This document corrects this omission, by updating Section 3 of
   [RFC5480] to make it clear that neither keyEncipherment nor the
   dataEncipherment key usage bits are set for key agreement algorithms
   defined therein.  The additions are to be made to the end of
   Section 3.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updates to Section 3

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   id-ecPublicKey in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then following values MUST
   NOT be present:

     keyEncipherment; and
     dataEncipherment.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   id-ecDH or id-ecMQV in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following
   values also MUST NOT be present:

     keyEncipherment; and
     dataEncipherment.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   found in [RFC5480].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
