1.  Introduction

   The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) [RFC8520] defines a YANG
   data model to express what sort of access a device requires to
   operate correctly.  The document additionally defines three ways for
   the device to communicate the URL of the resulting JSON [RFC8259]
   format file to a network enforcement point: DHCP, within an X.509
   certificate extension, and via LLDP.

   Each of the above mechanism conveys the MUD URL inband, and requires
   modifications to the device firmware.  Most small IoT devices do not
   have LLDP, and often have very restricted DHCP clients.  Adding the
   LLDP or DHCP options requires at least some minimal configuration
   change, and possibly entire new subsystems.  Meanwhile, use of the
   PKIX certificateion extension only makes sense as part of a larger
   IDevID based [ieee802-1AR] deployment such as
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

Internet-Draft                   SHG-MUD                  September 2020


   In the above cases these mechanisms can only be implemented by
   persons with access to modify and update the firmware of the device.
   The MUD system was designed to be implemented by Manufacturers
   afterall!

   In the meantime there is a chicken or egg problem ([chickenegg]): no
   manufacturers include MUD URLs in their products as there are no
   gateways that use them.  No gateways include code that processes MUD
   URLs as no products produce them.

   The mechanism described here allows any person with physical access
   to the device to affix a reference to a MUD URL that can later be
   scanned by an end user.

   Such an action can be done by * the marketing department of the
   Manufacturer, * an outsourced assembler plant, * value added
   resellers (perhaps in response to a local RFP), * a company importing
   the product (possibly to comply with a local regulation), * a network
   administrator (perhaps before sending devices home with employees, or
   to remote sites), * a retailer as a value added service.

   The mechanism described herein uses a QRcode, which is informally
   described in [qrcode], but specifically leverages the data format
   from Reverse Logistics Association's [SQRL] system.  This is an
   application of the 12N Data Identifier system specified by the ANSI
   MH10.8.2 Committee in a format appropriate for QRcodes as well as
   other things like NFCs transmissions.

   QR code generators are available as web services
   ([qrcodewebservice]), or as programs such as [qrencode].  They are
   formally defined in [isoiec18004].

   Section {#genericfirmware} summarizes the recommendations
   [I-D.richardson-opsawg-mud-acceptable-urls] section 2 ("Updating MUD
   URLs vs Updating MUD files").  The question as to whether the MUD
   file should be specific to a specific version of the device firmware
   is considered in the context of affixed external labels.

   A third issue is that an intermediary (ISP, or third-party security
   service) may want to extend or amend a MUD file received from a
   manufacturer.  In order to maintain an audit trail of changes, a way
   to encode the previous MUD URL and signature file (and status) is
   provided.  (FOR DISCUSSION)

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol

   This QRcode protocol builds upon the work by [SQRL].  That protocol
   is very briefly described in the next section.  Then the list of
   needed Data Records to be filled in is explained.

3.1.  The SQRL protocol

   [SQRL] documents an octet protocol that can be efficiently encoded
   into QRcodes using a sequence of ASCII bytes, plus five control codes
   (see section 3.1 of [SQRL]): * <RS> Record Separator (ASCII 30) *
   <EoT> End of Transmission (ASCII 4) * <FS> Field Seperator (ASCII 28)
   * <GS> Group Seperator (ASCII 29) * <US> Unit Seperator (ASCII 31), *
   Concatenation Operator (ASCII 43: "+").

   Section 7.2 of [SQRL] gives the details, which can be summarized as:

   1.  The QR code header starts with:

   "[)>" &lt;RS> "06" &lt;GS> "12N"

   1.  Include one or more Data Records.  This consists of a four letter
       Field Identifiers followed by ASCII characters terminated with a
       <Unit Separator>.

   2.  End with:

   &lt;RS>&lt;EoT>

   There are, additionally optional flags that may be present in every
   Data Record as described in section 7.4.  As there is little use for
   this in the context of MUD URLs, they can likely be ignored by
   parsers that are not parsing any of the rest of the information.  A
   parser that sees a Field Separator in the stream SHOULD ignore the
   characters collected so far and then continue parsing to get the user
   data.

   Environment records, as described in section 7.4, look and act
   exactly as fields, with a special Field Identifier.  They serve no
   purpose when looking for MUD information, and MAY be ignored.

3.2.  Manufacturer Usage Descriptions in SQRL

3.2.1.  B000 Company Name

   The B000 Data Record is mandatory in [SQRL].  It should be an ASCII
   reprensentation of the company or brand name.  It should match the
   ietf-mud/mud/mfg-name in the MUD file.

3.2.2.  B001 Product Name

   The B001 Data Record is optional.  It is the Product Name in ASCII.
   It's presence is strongly RECOMMENDED.

3.2.3.  B002 Model Number

   The B002 Data Record is optional in [SQRL], but is MANDATORY in this
   profile.  It is the Model Name in ASCII.  It should match the ietf-
   mud/mud/model-name in the MUD file, if it is present.

3.2.4.  MUD URL Data Record

   A new Field Identifier has been request from the RLA, which is "UXXX"
   (probably "U087") This record should be filled with the MUD URL.
   Shorter is better.  Section 8.1 of [SQRL] has some good advice on
   longevity concerns with URLs.

   The URL provided MUST NOT have a query (?) portion present.

3.2.5.  MUD device MAC address

   In order for the MUD controller to associate the above policy with a
   specific device, then some unique identifier must be provided to the
   MUD controller.  The most actionable identifier is the ethernet MAC
   address.  [SQRL] section 9.10 defines the Data Record: "M06C" as the
   MAC address.  No format for the MAC address is provided in the
   document.

   The recommended format in order to conserve space is 12 or 16 hex
   octects. (16 octets for the newer IEEE OUI-64 format used in
   802.15.4, and some next generation ethernet proposals)

   The parser SHOULD be tolerant of extra characters: colons (":"),
   dashes ("-"), and whitespace.

4.  Generic URL or Version Specific URL

   MUD URLs which are communicated inband by the device, and which are
   programmed into the device's firmware may provide a firmware specific
   version of the MUD URL.  This has the advantage that the resulting
   ACLs implemented are specific to the needs of that version of the
   firmware.

   A MUD URL which is afixed to the device with a sticker, or etched
   into the case can not be changed.

   Given the considerations of
   [I-D.richardson-opsawg-mud-acceptable-urls] section 2.1 ("Updating
   the MUD file in place"), it is prudent to use a MUD URL which points
   to a MUD file which will only have new features added over time, and
   never removed.

   When the firmware eventually receives built-in MUD URL support, then
   a more specific URL may be used.

   Note that in many cases it will be third parties who are generating
   these QRcodes, so the MUD file may be hosted by the third party.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   The presence of the MUD URL in the QR code reveals the manufacturer
   of the device, the type or model of the device, and possibly the
   firmware version of the device.

   The MAC address of the device will also need to be present, and this
   is potentially Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  Such
   QRcodes should not be placed on the outside of the packaging, and
   only on the device itself, ideally on a non-prominent part of the
   device. (e.g., the bottom).

   The QR code sticker should not placed on any part of the device that
   might become visible to machine vision systems in the same area.
   This includes security systems, robotic vacuum cleaners, anyone
   taking a picture with a camera.  Such systems may store the
   picture(s) in such a way that a future viewer of the image will be
   able to decode the QR code, possibly through assembly of multiple
   pictures.  Of course, the QR code is not, however, a certain
   indicator that the device is present, only that the QR code sticker
   that came with the device is present.
