1. Conventions Used

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   The present document seeks to register a media type for Downloadable
   Sounds (DLS). The DLS format is used to define instruments for widely
   used wavetable synthesizers associated with the standards [DLS1,
   DLS2, MDLS]. DLS, and their associated standards are maintained and
   defined by two organizations, the MIDI Manufacturers Association
   (MMA) and the Association of the Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI).

   The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify DLS files
   when they are served over HTTP, included in multi-part documents, or
   used in other places where media types are used.


3. Security Considerations

   The DLS format may contain audio, displayable text data, and modeling
   parameters (a.k.a. articulation parameters). In addition, the DLS
   format contains a so-called conditional chunk which is 'active' in
   the sense that it affects the execution of a DLS file parser.
   However, the DLS format does not currently define any scripting
   mechanism.

   Clearly it is possible to author malicious files which, for example,
   contain large amounts of data always blocked by a conditional
   statement, i.e. no synthesizer loads the instruments.

   However, for DLS, clients can and usually do protect themselves
   against these kinds of attacks. For DLS content containing
   conditional chunks it is stressed that the chunk in question is
   optional, that is to say a parser does not have to execute the chunk.
   However, if a parser evaluates a conditional chunk, it is still
   possible to parse its content and draw a conclusion whether or not it
   is usable for a particular synthesizer engine.

   It should be noted that selected metadata fields may include
   information partly intended to protect the media against unauthorized
   use or distribution. In this case the intention is that alteration or
   removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offence under
   national agreements based on World Intellection Property Organization
   (WIPO) treaties.

   DLS have an extensible structure, making it theoretically possible to
   define metadata fields or media formats in the future which could be
   used to induce particular actions of the recipient, and thus present
   additional security risks. However, this type of capability is
   currently not supported in the referenced specifications.

   There is no current provision in the DLS standard for encryption,
   signing, or authentication within the file formats.


4. IANA Considerations

   The present document requests that IANA registers the media type
   audio/dls as specified in Section 4.1. The registration uses the
   template present in [FREED].


4.1. Media Type for Downloadable Sounds

   Type name:                         audio

   Subtype name:                      dls

   Required parameters:               none

   Optional parameters:               'dls-type'
                                      A comma-separated list of the dls
                                      types (one or more) that the file
                                      content conforms to. The following
                                      values are specified: 0, 1, and 2
                                      signify Downloadable Sounds Level
                                      1.1b content, Downloadable Sounds
                                      Level 2.1 content, and Mobile
                                      Downloadable Sound content,
                                      respectively. All types that the
                                      content conforms to SHOULD be
                                      indicated. Further values
                                      (integers) MAY be specified in the
                                      future, and any unknown values
                                      SHALL be ignored. If the parameter
                                      is not specified, it corresponds
                                      to a value equal to 0, i.e. the
                                      content conforms to Downloadable
                                      Sound level 1.1b.

   Encoding considerations:           DLS files are binary and should be
                                      transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                      without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                      stripping etc.; base64 [RFC3548]
                                      is a suitable encoding.
