Abstract

   This document describes an address management module for mobile
   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP). The module is used for
   a mobile node to manage the IP addresses associated with an mSCTP
   association. The address management module utilizes the link layer
   signal strength information in order to determine when to add or
   delete end-point IP addresses of a mobile node and how to change the
   primary path from the mSCTP association when a handover happens.

1.  Introduction

   The multi-homing feature of Stream Control Transmission Protocol
   (SCTP)[2] can be used to provide mobility support. Recently, the
   mobile SCTP(mSCTP)[3] has been proposed as a transport layer mobility
   solution. For mSCTP handover, a Mobile Node(MN) can send an ADDIP
   ASCONF chunk to the Correspondent Node(CN) to ensure that a newly
   obtained IP address is added to the SCTP association. The MN may also
   request the CN to delete an existing IP address from the SCTP
   association by sending a DELETEIP ASCONF chunk. The primary data path
   for an SCTP association may also be changed to the other IP address
   by using a Set-primary ASCONF chunk. In this way, the MN can perform
   mSCTP handover to a new location without aid of the network.

   The current specification of mSCTP specifies the basic requirements
   and suggestions to utilize Dynamic Address Reconfiguration
   Extension[4] to support session mobility. Some essential issues, such
   as when and by which criteria the primary path to be changed or the
   addition and deletion of the IP addresses mapped to the SCTP
   association should occur in order to deal with handover seamlessly,
   are not specified yet.

   In this document, we describe a logical block named Address
   Management Module(AMM), which determines when to trigger ADDIP,
   DELETEIP, and Set-primary ASCONF chunk utilizing the signal strength
   of the underlying link and informs it to the mSCTP at MN.



2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST" "MUST NOT" "REQUIRED" "SHALL" "SHALL NOT"
   "SHOULD" "SHOULD NOT" "RECOMMENDED" "MAY" and "OPTIONAL"in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  Address Management for mSCTP

   When handover happens, mSCTP at MN should perform ADDIP for the new
   IP address DELETEIP for the old one, and Set-primary for the current
   primary path. Therefore, we define Address Management Module(AMM)
   which determines when to trigger ADDIP, DELETEIP, and Set-primary
   ASCONF chunk utilizing the signal strength of the underlying link and
   informs it to the mSCTP at MN. When AMM triggers mSCTP, mSCTP at MN
   interacts with peer mSCTP at CN to change the end point mapping or
   the primary path for the SCTP association.

   In order to determine when to trigger ADDIP and DELETEIP, AMM uses L2
   radio signal strength information. AMM triggers mSCTP to perform
   ADDIP as soon as the signal strength of the new access router exceeds
   the signal strength threshold value that enables communications
   (hereinafter, it is called L2-TH). Once an IP address is added,
   DELETEIP for that address is not triggered until the signal strength
   from the corresponding access router becomes lower than the L2-TH.
   With these policies, an SCTP association maintains the MN's IP
   address corresponding to all of the accessible subnets. Furthermore,
   an accessible IP address is added to the SCTP association as early as
   possible. The main purpose of these policies regarding adding or
   deleting end point IP addresses is to maximize the change that an end
   point IP address is ready when it is needed for handover.

   In order to determine when to trigger the primary path change, AMM
   also uses L2 radio signal strength information. If the radio signal
   strength of the primary path becomes lower than a certain threshold
   (hereinafter, it is called Primary-TH), primary path is replaced. The
   value of Primary-TH is set slightly higher than L2-TH in order to
   have the primary path change occur before deleting the primary path.
   While satisfying this condition, the Primary-TH should be as low as
   possible in order to reduce the number of unnecessary primary path
   changes. In addition, we suggest that AMM selects a new primary path
   utilizing the L2 radio signal strength information of the wireless
   subnet, the one providing strongest radio signal is selected as the
   new primary path in order to minimize the possible oscillation.

3.1   Communication between AMM and the other modules

   Figure 1 presents the interaction between AMM and the rest of mSCTP,
   IP address acquisition module, and link layer respectively. Receiving
   signals from the link layer and the IP address acquisition module,
   AMM determines when to trigger ADDIP, DELETEIP, and Set-primary
   ASCONF chunk and informs it to mSCTP. mSCTP at MN then interacts with
   peer mSCTP at CN to change the end point mapping or the primary path
   for the SCTP association.

   signals to AMM in order to inform AMM about an L2 handover completion
   or changes of link signal strength:

   (1)L2HC(L2 Handover Completion): the L2 handover is completed for the
   interface specified in the signal

   (2)Max-IN(Interface with Maximum signal strength): the interface
   providing maximum signal strength has been changed to the one
   specified in the signal

   (3)L2SS(L2 Signal Strength): one of the L2 signal strength changes
   shown in figure 2 has occurred for a certain interface; L2SS
   specifies the interface for which the change has occurred and the
   types of signal strength change(S).

                    Figure 2 L2 signal strength change

   IP address acquisition module sends out IPAC(IP address Acquisition
   Completion) signal when an IP address acquisition for an interface is
   completed. The IPAC signal indicates the interface ID and the
   acquired IP address for that interface.

   In order to store the information collected from the signals from the
   link layer and the IP address acquisition module as shown in figure 1,
   AMM maintains an Address Table as shown in figure 3. The SS(Signal
   Strength) field of the address table indicates the current signal
   strength of the interface, and the meaning of the value of this field
   is shown in table 2. The H flag in the address table indicates
   whether the L2 handover is completed for the corresponding interface.
   Receiving  L2HC  signal  for  a  certain  interface,  H  flag  of
   corresponding entry in the address table can be set. The IP address
   field of the address table is filled when IPAC signal for the
   corresponding entry comes in from the IP address acquisition module.
   In addition to address table, AMM also maintains information such as
   the interface corresponding to the current primary path and the
   interface with maximum signal strength.

3.2   Operation of AMM

   mSCTP at MN sends ADDIP ASCONF chunk for a certain IP address when
   both  the  L2  handover  and  the  IP  address  acquisition  of  the
   corresponding interface are competed. That is, by receiving either an
   L2HC or an IPAC signal, if both the IP address field and the H flag
   are set for a certain entry of the address table, AMM triggers mSCTP
   to send ADDIP ASCONF chunk for the corresponding interface.

   When AMM receives L2SS with S=4 or 6 for the current primary path
   interface, the primary path should be replaced. AMM first checks
   whether there is an alternative interface ready to be used as the new
   primary path. If one is found, it immediately triggers mSCTP to send
   Set-primary ASCONF chunk in order to replace the primary path with
   that alternative interface. In order for an interface to be a primary
   path interface, it should satisfy the following three conditions:






MJCHANG                     Expires - September 2004                 [Page 6]
                 Address Management for Mobile SCTP Handover         March 2004


   (1)It is the interface with maximum signal strength and the signal
      strength is greater than the æPrimary-TH? Note that even the
      interface with the maximum signal strength may not provide the
      signal strength higher than the Primary-TH.

   (2)Link layer handover for the interface is completed.

   (3)IP address acquisition for the interface is completed.

   If there is no such interface, AMM postpones triggering mSCTP to send
   Set-primary ASCONF chunk until a path which satisfies all three of
   the above conditions appears. In order to avoid frequent changes of
   primary path during handover, the primary path is not replaced until
   a path which is stable enough is found even though the current one
   becomes inadequate. In the proposed scheme, a stable path is defined
   as the path that satisfies the above three conditions. The status of
   an interface may be transformed to being stable by incoming L2SS,
   L2HC, or IPAC signals. Having SS being equal to 0 or 1 for the
   current primary path indicates that the current primary path has
   become inadequate. Therefore, in this case, AMM triggers mSCTP to
   send Set-primary ASCONF chunk as soon as interface satisfying all
   three conditions of the primary path interface shows up.

   If AMM receives an L2SS signal with S=5 or 6 for a certain interface,
   AMM triggers mSCTP to send DELETEIP ASCONF chunk in order to delete
   that interface. If the interface happens to be the current primary
   path interface, AMM searches an alternative interface to serve as the
   primary path. If there is no interface ready to replace the primary
   path, triggering mSCTP to send DELETEIP ASCONF chunk should be
   postponed. In this case, whenever mSCTP to send Set-primary ASCONF
   chunk is triggered afterwards, sending DELETEIP ASCONF chunk for the
   current primary path interface should be triggered together.
