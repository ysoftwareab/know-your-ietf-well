     Abstract 

        The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing 
        multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session 
        invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was 
        not intended to provide capability indication or capability 
        negotiation, however over the years, SDP has seen widespread adoption 
        and as a result it has been gradually extended to provide limited 
        support for these, notably in the form of the offer/answer model

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        defined in RFC 3264. SDP and its current extensions however do not 
        define how to negotiate one or more alternative transport protocols 
        (e.g. RTP profiles) or attributes. This makes it difficult to deploy 
        new RTP profiles such as secure RTP or RTP with RTCP-based feedback, 
        negotiate use of different keying mechanisms, etc. It also presents 
        problems for some forms of media negotiation.  

        The purpose of this document is to address these shortcomings by 
        extending SDP with capability negotiation parameters and associated 
        offer/answer procedures to use those parameters in a backwards 
        compatible manner.  

        The solution provided in this document provides a general SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework. It also defines specifically how to 
        provide attributes and transport protocols as capabilities and 
        negotiate them using the framework. Extensions for other types of 
        capabilities (e.g. media types and media formats) may be provided in 
        other documents.

     1. Introduction 

        The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing 
        multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session 
        invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. The SDP 
        contains one or more media stream descriptions with information such 
        as IP-address and port, type of media stream (e.g. audio or video), 
        transport protocol (possibly including profile information, e.g. 
        RTP/AVP or RTP/SAVP), media formats (e.g. codecs), and various other 
        session and media stream parameters that define the session.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        Simply providing media stream descriptions is sufficient for session 
        announcements for a broadcast application, where the media stream 
        parameters are fixed for all participants. When a participant wants 
        to join the session, he obtains the session announcement and uses the 
        media descriptions provided, e.g., joins a multicast group and 
        receives media packets in the encoding format specified.  If the 
        media stream description is not supported by the participant, he is 
        unable to receive the media.  

        Such restrictions are not generally acceptable to multimedia session 
        invitations, where two or more entities attempt to establish a media 
        session that uses a set of media stream parameters acceptable to all 
        participants. First of all, each entity must inform the other of its 
        receive address, and secondly, the entities need to agree on the 
        media stream parameters to use for the session, e.g. transport 
        protocols and codecs. To solve this, RFC 3264 [RFC3264] defined the 
        offer/answer model, whereby an offerer constructs an offer SDP that 
        lists the media streams, codecs, and other SDP parameters that the 
        offerer is willing to use. This offer SDP is sent to the answerer, 
        which chooses from among the media streams, codecs and other SDP 
        parameters provided, and generates an answer SDP with his parameters, 
        based on that choice. The answer SDP is sent back to the offerer 
        thereby completing the session negotiation and enabling the 
        establishment of the negotiated media streams.  

        Taking a step back, we can make a distinction between the 
        capabilities supported by each participant, the way in which those 
        capabilities can be supported and the parameters that can actually be 
        used for the session. More generally, we can say that we have the 
        following: 

        o  A set of capabilities for the session and its associated media 
           stream components, supported by each side. The capability 
           indication by itself does not imply a commitment to use the 
           capability in the session.  
            
           A capability can for example be that the "RTP/SAVP" profile is 
           supported, that the "PCMU" codec is supported, or that the 
           "crypto" attribute is supported with a particular value.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        o  A set of potential configurations indicating which combinations of 
           those capabilities can be used for the session and its associated 
           media stream components. Potential configurations are not ready 
           for use. Instead, they provide an alternative that may be used, 
           subject to further negotiation. 
            
           A potential configuration can for example indicate that the "PCMU" 
           codec and the "RTP/SAVP" transport protocol are not only supported 
           (i.e. listed as capabilities), but they are offered for potential 
           use in the session.  

        o  An actual configuration for the session and its associated media 
           stream components, which specifies which combinations of session 
           parameters and media stream components can be used currently and 
           with what parameters. Use of an actual configuration does not 
           require any further negotiation.  
            
           A actual configuration can for example be that the "PCMU" codec 
           and the "RTP/SAVP" transport protocol are offered for use 
           currently. 

        o  A negotiation process that takes the set of actual and potential 
           configurations (combinations of capabilities) as input and 
           provides the negotiated actual configurations as output.  

        SDP by itself was designed to provide only one of these, namely 
        listing of the actual configurations, however over the years, use of 
        SDP has been extended beyond its original scope.  Of particular 
        importance are the session negotiation semantics that were defined by 
        the offer/answer model in RFC 3264. In this model, both the offer and 
        the answer contain actual configurations; separate capabilities and 
        potential configurations are not supported.  

        Other relevant extensions have been defined as well. RFC 3407 
        [RFC3407] defined simple capability declarations, which extends SDP 
        with a simple and limited set of capability descriptions.  Grouping 
        of media lines, which defines how media lines in SDP can have other 
        semantics than the traditional "simultaneous media streams" 
        semantics, was defined in RFC 3388 [RFC3388], etc.   

        Each of these extensions was designed to solve a specific limitation 
        of SDP.  Since SDP had already been stretched beyond its original 
        intent, a more comprehensive capability declaration and negotiation 
        process was intentionally not defined.  Instead, work on a "next 
        generation" of a protocol to provide session description and 
        capability negotiation was initiated [SDPng].  SDPng defined a 
        comprehensive capability negotiation framework and protocol that was

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        not bound by existing SDP constraints. SDPng was not designed to be 
        backwards compatible with existing SDP and hence required both sides 
        to support it, with a graceful fallback to legacy operation when 
        needed. This combined with lack of ubiquitous multipart MIME support 
        in the protocols that would carry SDP or SDPng made it challenging to 
        migrate towards SDPng. In practice, SDPng has not gained traction but 
        rather remained as work in progress for an extended period of time.  
        Existing real-time multimedia communication protocols such as SIP, 
        RTSP, Megaco, and MGCP continue to use SDP.  SDP and its current 
        extensions however do not address an increasingly important problem: 
        the ability to negotiate one or more alternative transport protocols 
        (e.g., RTP profiles) and associated parameters (e.g. SDP attributes).  
        This makes it difficult to deploy new RTP profiles such as secure RTP 
        (SRTP) [SRTP], RTP with RTCP-Based Feedback [AVPF], etc.  This 
        particular problem is exacerbated by the fact that RTP profiles are 
        defined independently.  When a new profile is defined and N other 
        profiles already exist, there is a potential need for defining N 
        additional profiles, since profiles cannot be combined automatically.  
        For example, in order to support the plain and secure RTP version of 
        RTP with and without RTCP-based feedback, four separate profiles (and 
        hence profile definitions) are needed: RTP/AVP [RFC3551], RTP/SAVP 
        [SRTP], RTP/AVPF [AVPF], and RTP/SAVPF [SAVPF].  In addition to the 
        pressing profile negotiation problem, other important real-life 
        limitations have been found as well. Keying material and other 
        parameters for example need to be negotiated with some of the 
        transport protocols, but not others. Similarly, some media formats 
        and types of media streams need to negotiate a variety of different 
        parameters.  

        The purpose of this document is to define a mechanism that enables 
        SDP to provide limited support for indicating capabilities and their 
        associated potential configurations, and negotiate the use of those 
        potential configurations as actual configurations.  It is not the 
        intent to provide a full-fledged capability indication and 
        negotiation mechanism along the lines of SDPng or ITU-T H.245. 
        Instead, the focus is on addressing a set of well-known real-life 
        limitations. More specifically, the solution provided in this 
        document provides a general SDP Capability Negotiation framework that 
        is backwards compatible with existing SDP. It also defines 
        specifically how to provide attributes and transport protocols as 
        capabilities and negotiate them using the framework. Extensions for 
        other types of capabilities (e.g. media types and formats) may be 
        provided in other documents. 

        As mentioned above, SDP is used by several protocols, and hence the 
        mechanism should be usable by all of these.  One particularly 
        important protocol for this problem is the Session Initiation

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  SIP uses the offer/answer model [RFC3264] 
        (which is not specific to SIP) to negotiate sessions and hence the 
        mechanism defined here defines the offer/answer procedures to use for 
        the capability negotiation framework.  

        The rest of the document is structured as follows. In Section 3. we 
        present the SDP Capability Negotiation solution, which consists of 
        new SDP attributes and associated offer/answer procedures. In Section 
        4. we provide examples illustrating its use and in Section 5. we 
        provide the security considerations. 

     2. Conventions used in this document 

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

     3. SDP Capability Negotiation Solution 

        In this section we first present the conceptual model behind the SDP 
        capability negotiation framework, followed by an overview of the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation solution. This is followed by definitions of 
        new SDP attributes for the solution and its associated updated 
        offer/answer procedures.  

     3.1. SDP Capability Negotiation Model  

        Our model uses the concepts of  

        o  Capabilities 

        o  Potential Configurations 

        o  Actual Configurations 

        o  Negotiation Process 

        as defined in Section 1. Conceptually, we want to offer not just the 
        actual configuration SDP, as is done with the current offer/answer 
        model, but the actual configuration SDP as well as one or more 
        alternative SDPs, i.e. potential configurations. The answerer must 
        choose either the actual configuration, or one of the potential 
        configurations, and generate an answer SDP based on that. Since the 
        offerer may need to perform processing on the answer, which depends 
        on the offer that was chosen (actual or potential configuration), the 
        answerer informs the offerer of which configuration he chose. The 
        process can be viewed *conceptually* as follows:

        The above illustrates the conceptual model, however the actual 
        solution uses only a single SDP, which contains the actual 
        configuration (as with current SDP and the current offer/answer 
        model) enhanced with several new attributes and associated 
        procedures, that encode the capabilities and potential configurations 
        and negotiate which ones to use. A more accurate depiction of the 
        actual offer SDP is therefore as follows:

        The above structure is used for two reasons: 

        o  Backwards compatibility:   As noted above, support for multipart 
           MIME is not ubiquitous. By encoding both capabilities and 
           potential configurations in SDP attributes, we can represent 
           everything in a single SDP thereby avoiding any multipart MIME 
           support issues. Furthermore, since unknown SDP attributes are 
           ignored by the SDP recipient, we ensure that entities that do not 
           support the framework simply perform the regular RFC 3264 
           offer/answer procedures. This provides us with seamless backwards 
           compatibility.  

        o  Message size efficiency:   When we have multiple media streams, 
           each of which may potentially use two or more different transport 
           protocols with a variety of different associated parameters, the 
           number of potential configurations can be large. If each possible 
           alternative is represented as a complete SDP in an offer, we can 
           easily end up with large messages. By providing a more compact 
           encoding, we get more efficient message sizes.  

        In the next section, we describe the exact structure and specific SDP 
        parameters used to represent this.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

     3.2. Solution Overview  

        The solution consists of the following: 

        o  Two new attributes to support extensions to the framework itself 
           as follows: 

            o  A new attribute ("a=csup") that lists the supported base 
               (optionally) and any supported extension options to the 
               framework. 

            o  A new attribute ("a=creq") that lists the extensions to the 
               framework that are required to be supported by the entity 
               receiving the SDP in order to do capability negotiation. 

        o  Two new attributes used to express capabilities as follows 
           (additional attributes can be defined as extensions): 

            o  A new attribute ("a=acap") that defines how to list an 
               attribute name, either with or without an associated value, as 
               a capability.  

            o  A new attribute ("a=tcap") that defines how to list transport 
               protocols (e.g. "RTP/AVP") as capabilities. 

        o  Two new attributes to negotiate configurations as follows: 

            o  A new attribute ("a=pcfg") that lists the potential 
               configurations supported. This is done by reference to the 
               capabilities from the SDP in question. Alternative potential 
               configurations have an explicit ordering associated with them. 
               Extension capabilities can be defined and referenced in the 
               potential configurations.  

            o  A new attribute ("a=acfg") to be used in an answer SDP. The 
               attribute identifies a potential configuration from an offer 
               SDP which was used as an actual configuration to form the 
               answer SDP. Extension capabilities can be included as well.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        o  Extensions to the offer/answer model that allow for capabilities 
           and potential configurations to be included in an offer. 
           Capabilities can be provided at the session level and the media 
           level. Potential configurations can be included at the media level 
           only, where they constitute alternative offers that may be 
           accepted by the answerer instead of the actual configuration(s) 
           included in the "m=" line(s). The answerer indicates which (if 
           any) of the potential configurations it used to form the answer by 
           including the actual configuration attribute ("a=acfg") in the 
           answer.  Capabilities may be included in answers as well, where 
           they can aid in guiding a subsequent new offer. 

        The mechanism is illustrated by the offer/answer exchange below, 
        where Alice sends an offer to Bob:  

                     Alice                               Bob 

                       | (1) Offer (SRTP and RTP)         | 
                       |--------------------------------->| 
                       |                                  | 
                       | (2) Answer (SRTP)                | 
                       |<---------------------------------| 
                       |                                  | 

        Alice's offer includes RTP and SRTP as alternatives. RTP is the 
        default (actual configuration), but SRTP is the preferred one 
        (potential configuration): 

           v=0 
           o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
           s=  
           c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
           t=0 0 
           m=audio 53456 RTP/AVP 0 18  

           a=tcap:1 RTP/SAVP  
           a=acap:1 a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32    
              inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32  
           a=pcfg:1 t=1 a=1   

        The "m=" line indicates that Alice is offering to use plain RTP with 
        PCMU or G.729.  The capabilities are provided by the "a=tcap" and 
        "a=acap" attributes. The transport capabilities ("a=tcap") indicate 
        that secure RTP under the AVP profile ("RTP/SAVP") is supported with 
        an associated transport capability handle of 1. The "acap" attribute 
        provides an attribute capability with a handle of 1. The attribute 
        capability is a "crypto" attribute, which provides the keying

        material for SRTP using SDP security descriptions [SDES]. The 
        "a=pcfg" attribute provides the potential configuration included in 
        the offer by reference to the capability parameters.  One alternative 
        is provided; it has a configuration number of 1 and it consists of 
        transport protocol capability 1 (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile - secure 
        RTP), and the attribute capability 1, i.e. the crypto attribute 
        provided. Potential configurations are always preferred over the 
        actual configuration included in the offer SDP, and hence Alice is 
        expressing a preference for using secure RTP. 

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports SRTP and the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework, and hence he accepts the 
        (preferred) potential configuration for Secure RTP provided by Alice 
        and generates the following answer SDP: 

           v=0 
           o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 192.0.2.2 
           s=  
           c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2 
           t=0 0 
           m=audio 54568 RTP/SAVP 0 18  
           a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80 
                 inline:PS1uQCVeeCFCanVmcjkpPywjNWhcYD0mXXtxaVBR|2^20|1:4
           a=acfg:1 t=1 a=1 

        Bob includes the "a=acfg" attribute in the answer to inform Alice 
        that he based his answer on an offer containing the potential 
        configuration with transport protocol capability 1 and attribute 
        capability 1 from the offer SDP (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile using the 
        keying material provided).  Bob also includes his keying material in 
        a "crypto" attribute. If Bob supported one or more extensions to the 
        capability negotiation framework, he would have included option tags 
        for those in the answer as well (in an "a=csup" attribute). 

        Note that in this particular example, the answerer supported the 
        capability negotiation extensions defined here, however had he not, 
        the answerer would simply have ignored the new attributes and 
        accepted the (actual configuration) offer to use normal RTP. In that 
        case, the following answer would have been generated instead: 

           v=0 
           o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 192.0.2.2 
           s=  
           c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2 
           t=0 0 
           m=audio 54568 RTP/AVP 0 18

     3.3. Relationship to RFC 3407 

        RFC 3407 defines capability descriptions with limited abilities to 
        describe attributes, bandwidth parameters, transport protocols and 
        media formats. RFC 3407 does not define any negotiation procedures 
        for actually using those capability descriptions.  

        This document obsoletes RFC 3407 by defining new attributes for 
        describing attribute capabilities and transport capabilities. It also 
        defines procedures for actually using those capabilities as part of 
        an offer/answer exchange. Extensions to this document may be defined 
        in order to fully cover all the capabilities provided by RFC 3407 
        (for example more general media capabilities).  

        It is RECOMMENDED that implementations use the attributes and 
        procedures defined in this document instead of those defined in 
        [RFC3407].  

        If capability description interoperability with legacy RFC 3407 
        implementations is desired, implementations MAY include both RFC 3407 
        capability descriptions and capabilities defined by this document. 
        The offer/answer negotiation procedures however will not be able to 
        use the RFC 3407 capability descriptions.  

     3.4. Version and Extension Indication Attributes 

        In this section, we present the new attributes associated with 
        indicating the SDP Capability Negotiation extensions supported and 
        required.  

     3.4.1. Supported Capability Negotiation Extensions Attribute 

        The SDP Capability Negotiation solution allows for capability 
        negotiation extensions to be defined. Associated with each such 
        extension is an option tag that identifies the extension in question. 
        Option-tags MUST be registered with IANA per the procedures defined 
        in Section 6.  

        The Supported Capability Negotiation Extensions attribute ("a=csup") 
        contains a comma-separated list of option tags identifying the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation extensions supported by the entity that 
        generated the SDP. The attribute is defined as follows: 

           a=csup: <option-tag-list>

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        RFC 4566, Section 9, provides the ABNF for SDP attributes. The "csup" 
        attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, with an 
        att-value defined as follows: 

           att-value         = option-tag-list 
           option-tag-list   = option-tag *("," option-tag) 
           option-tag        = token    ; defined in [RFC4566] 

         
        A special base option tag with a value of "cap-v0" is defined for the 
        basic SDP Capability Negotiation framework defined in this document. 
        Entities can use this option tag with the "a=csup" attribute to 
        indicate support for the SDP Capability Negotiation framework 
        specified in this document.  

        The following examples illustrates the use of the "a=csup" attribute 
        with the "cap-v0" option tags and two hypothetical option tags, "foo" 
        and "bar" (note the lack of white space): 

           a=csup:cap-v0 

           a=csup:foo 

           a=csup:bar 

           a=csup:cap-v0,foo,bar 

        The "a=csup" attribute can be provided at the session and the media-
        level. When provided at the session-level, it applies to the entire 
        SDP. When provided at the media-level, it applies to the media 
        description in question only (option-tags provided at the session 
        level apply as well). There can be at most one "a=csup" attribute at 
        the session-level and at most one at the media-level (one per media 
        description in the latter case).  

        Whenever an entity that supports one or more extensions to the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework generates an SDP, it SHOULD include 
        the "a=csup" attribute with the option tags for the extensions it 
        supports at the session and/or media-level, unless those option tags 
        are already provided in one or more "a=creq" attribute (see Section 
        3.4.2. ) at the relevant levels. Inclusion of the base option tag is 
        OPTIONAL; support for the base framework can be inferred from 
        presence of the "a=pcfg" attribute defined in Section 3.6.1.   

          Use of the base option tag may still be useful in some scenarios, 
          e.g. when using SIP OPTIONS [RFC3261] or generating an answer to an 
          offer that did not use the SDP Capability Negotiation framework.

     3.4.2. Required Capability Negotiation Extension Attribute 

        The Required Capability Negotiation Extensions attribute ("a=creq") 
        contains a comma-separated list of option tags (see Section 3.4.1. ) 
        specifying the SDP Capability Negotiation extensions that MUST be 
        supported by the entity receiving the SDP, in order for that entity 
        to properly process the SDP Capability Negotiation attributes and 
        associated procedures. Support for the basic negotiation framework is 
        implied by the presence of an "a=pcfg" attribute (see Section 3.6.1. 
        ) and hence there is no need to include the "a=creq" attribute with 
        the base option-tag ("cap-v0"). Still, it is allowed to do so.  

        The attribute is defined as follows: 

           a=creq: <option-tag-list> 

        The "creq" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
        with an att-value defined as follows: 

           att-value   = option-tag-list 

        The following examples illustrate the use of the "a=creq" attribute 
        with the "cap-v0" base option tag and two hypothetical option tags, 
        "foo" and "bar" (note the lack of white space): 

           a=creq:cap-v0 

           a=creq:foo 

           a=creq:bar 

           a=creq:cap-v0,foo,bar 

        The "a=creq" attribute can be provided at the session and the media-
        level. When provided at the session-level, it applies to the entire 
        SDP. When provided at the media-level, it applies to the media 
        description in question only (required option tags provided at the 
        session level apply as well). There can be at most one "a=creq" 
        attribute at the session-level and at most one "a=creq" attribute at 
        the media-level (one per media description in the latter case).  

        When an entity generates an SDP and it requires the recipient of that 
        SDP to support one or more SDP Capability Negotiation extensions 
        (except for the base), in order to properly process the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation, the "a=creq" attribute MUST be included with

        implied by the presence of an "a=pcfg" attribute (see Section 3.6.1. 
        ) and hence it is not required to include the "a=creq" attribute with 
        the base option-tag ("cap-v0"). 

        A recipient that receives an SDP and does not support one or more of 
        the required extensions listed in a "creq" attribute, MUST NOT 
        perform the SDP Capability Negotiation defined in this document. For 
        non-supported extensions provided at the session-level, this implies 
        that SDP Capability Negotiation MUST NOT be performed at all. For 
        non-supported extensions at the media-level, this implies that SDP 
        Capability Negotiation MUST NOT be performed for the media stream in 
        question.  

          An entity that does not support the SDP Capability Negotiation 
          framework at all, will ignore these attributes (as well as the 
          other SDP Capability Negotiation attributes) and not perform any 
          SDP Capability Negotiation in the first place. 

        When an entity does not support one or more required SDP Capability 
        Negotiation extensions, the entity SHOULD proceed as if the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation attributes were not included in the first 
        place, i.e. all the capability negotiation attributes should be 
        ignored.  In that case, the entity SHOULD include a "csup" attribute 
        listing the SDP Capability Negotiation extensions it actually 
        supports.  

          This ensures that introduction of the SDP Capability Negotiation 
          mechanism by itself does not lead to session failures.  

     3.5. Capability Attributes 

        In this section, we present the new attributes associated with 
        indicating the capabilities for use by the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation. 

     3.5.1. Attribute Capability Attribute 

        Attributes and their associated values can be expressed as 
        capabilities by use of a new attribute capability attribute 
        ("a=acap"), which is defined as follows: 

           a=acap: <att-cap-num> <att-par> 

        where <att-cap-num> is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both 
        included) used to number the attribute capability and <att-par> is an 
        attribute ("a=") in its full  '<type>=<value>' form (see [RFC4566]). 
        Support for a specific attribute (name) (without any particular

        values) can be indicated by providing only the '<type>' (i.e. the 
        attribute name).  

        The "acap" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
        with an att-value defined as follows: 

           att-value   = att-cap-num 1*WSP att-par 
           att-cap-num = 1*DIGIT ;defined in [RFC4234] 
           att-par     = attribute  ;defined in RFC 4566 

        Note that white-space is not permitted before the att-cap-num.  
         
        The "acap" attribute can be provided at the session level only for 
        session-level attributes contained in the attribute capability, 
        whereas media level attributes can be provide in attribute 
        capabilities at either the media level or session-level. The base SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework however only defines procedures for 
        use of media-level attribute capabilities at the media level 
        (extensions may define use at the session level).  

        Each occurrence of the "acap" attribute in the entire session 
        description MUST use a different value of <att-cap-num>.   

          There is a need to be able to reference both session-level and 
          media-level attributes in potential configurations at the media 
          level, and this provides for a simple solution to avoiding overlap 
          between the references (handles) to each attribute capability. 

        The <att-cap-num> values provided are independent of similar <cap-
        num> values provided for other types of capabilities, i.e., they form 
        a separate name-space for attribute capabilities.  

        The following examples illustrate use of the "acap" attribute:  

           a=acap:1 a=ptime:20 
         
           a=acap:2 a=ptime:30 

           a=acap:3 a=key-mgmt:mikey AQAFgM0XflABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsAyONQ6gAA

           a=acap:6 a=key-mgmt 

        The first two attribute capabilities provide attribute values for the 
        ptime attribute. The third provides SRTP parameters by using MIKEY 
        with the key-mgmt attribute [KMGMT]. The fourth provides SRTP 
        parameters by use of security descriptions with the crypto attribute 
        [SDES]. Note that the line-wrapping and new-lines in example three 
        and four are provided for formatting reasons only - they are not 
        permitted in actual SDP. The 5th attribute capability merely 
        indicates support for the "crypto" attribute (without any further 
        information about particular values to use with it), and the 6th 
        attribute capability merely indicates support for the "key-mgmt" 
        attribute.  

          Readers familiar with RFC 3407 may notice the similarity between 
          the RFC 3407 "cpar" attribute and the above. There are however a 
          couple of important differences, notably that the "acap" attribute 
          contains a handle that enables referencing it and it furthermore 
          supports attributes only (the "cpar" attribute defined in RFC 3407 
          supports bandwidth information as well). The "acap" attribute also 
          is not automatically associated with any particular capabilities.  

     3.5.2. Transport Protocol Capability Attribute 

        Transport Protocols can be expressed as capabilities by use of a new 
        Transport Protocol Capability attribute ("a=tcap") defined as 
        follows: 

           a=tcap: <trpr-cap-num> <proto-list> 

        where <trpr-cap-num> is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both 
        included) used to number the transport address capability for later 
        reference, and <proto-list> is one or more <proto>, separated by 
        white space, as defined in the SDP "m=" line.  

        The "tcap" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
        with an att-value defined as follows: 

           att-value      = trpr-cap-num 1*WSP proto-list 
           trpr-cap-num   = 1*DIGIT ;defined in [RFC4234] 
           proto-list     = proto *(1*WSP proto) ; defined in RFC 4566 

        Note that white-space is not permitted before the trpr-cap-num.  

        The "tcap" attribute can be provided at the session-level and the 
        media-level. There can be at most one "a=tcap" attribute at the 
        session-level and at most one at the media-level (one per media

        description in the latter case). Each occurrence of the "tcap" 
        attribute in the entire session description MUST use a different 
        value of <trpr-cap-num>.  When multiple <proto> values are provided, 
        the first one is associated with the value <trpr-cap-num>, the second 
        one with the value one higher, etc. The <trpr-cap-num> values 
        provided are independent of similar <cap-num> values provided for 
        other capability attributes, i.e., they form a separate name-space 
        for transport protocol capabilities.  

        Below, we provide examples of the "a=tcap" attribute: 

           a=tcap:1 RTP/AVP 

           a=tcap:2 RTP/AVPF 

           a=tcap:3 RTP/SAVP RTP/SAVPF 

        The first one provides a capability for the "RTP/AVP" profile defined 
        in [RFC3551] and the second one provides a capability for the RTP 
        with RTCP-Based Feedback profile defined in [AVPF]. The third one 
        provides capabilities for the "RTP/SAVP" (transport capability number 
        3) and "RTP/SAVPF" profiles (transport protocol capability number 4).  

        Transport capabilities are inherently included in the "m=" line, 
        however they still need to be specified explicitly in a "tcap" 
        attribute, if they are to be used as a capability.  

          This may seem redundant (and indeed it is from the offerer's point 
          of view), however it is done to protect against intermediaries 
          (e.g. middle-boxes) that may modify "m=" lines while passing 
          unknown attributes through. If an implicit transport capability 
          were used instead (e.g. a reserved transport capability number 
          could be used to refer to the transport protocol in the "m=" line), 
          and an intermediary were to modify the transport protocol in the 
          "m=" line (e.g. to translate between plain RTP and secure RTP), 
          then the potential configuration referencing that implicit 
          transport capability may no longer be correct. With explicit 
          capabilities, we avoid this pitfall, although the potential 
          configuration preference (see Section 3.6.1. ) may not reflect that 
          of the intermediary (which some may view as a feature). 

     3.5.3. Extension Capability Attributes 

        The SDP Capability Negotiation framework allows for new capabilities 
        to be defined as extensions and used with the general capability 
        negotiation framework. The syntax and semantics of such new 
        capability attributes are not defined here, however in order to be

        used with potential configurations, they SHOULD allow for a numeric 
        handle to be associated with each capability. This handle can be used 
        as a reference within the potential and actual configuration 
        attributes (see Section 3.6.1. and 3.6.2. ). The definition of such 
        extension capability attributes MUST also state whether they can be 
        applied at the session-level, media-level, or both.  

     3.6. Configuration Attributes 

     3.6.1. Potential Configuration Attribute 

        Potential Configurations can be expressed by use of a new Potential 
        Configuration Attribute ("a=pcfg") defined as follows:  

           a=pcfg: <config-number> [<pot-cfg-list>] 

        where <config-number> is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both 
        included).  

        The "pcfg" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
        with an att-value defined as follows: 

           att-value      = config-number [1*WSP pot-cfg-list] 
           config-number  = 1*DIGIT ;defined in [RFC4234] 
           pot-cfg-list   = pot-config *(1*WSP pot-config) 
           pot-config     = pot-attribute-config-list / 
                            pot-transport-protocol-config-list / 
                            pot-extension-config-list 

        The missing productions are defined below. Note that white-space is 
        not permitted before the config-number.  

        The potential configuration attribute can be provided at the media-
        level only and there can be multiple instances of it within a given 
        media description. The attribute includes a configuration number, 
        which is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included). The 
        configuration number MUST be unique within the media description 
        (i.e. it has media level scope only). The configuration number also 
        indicates the relative preference of potential configurations; lower 
        numbers are preferred over higher numbers. 

        After the configuration number, zero, one or more potential 
        configuration lists is provided. When the potential configuration 
        list is omitted, the potential configuration equals the actual 
        configuration. The potential configuration lists generally reference 
        one or more capabilities, and those capabilities are (conceptually) 
        used to construct a new internal version of the SDP by use of purely

        syntactic add and (possibly) delete operations on the original SDP 
        (actual configuration), thereby generating an alternative potential 
        configuration SDP that can be used by conventional SDP and 
        offer/answer procedures if actually selected. 
         
        This document defines potential attribute configuration lists and 
        potential transport protocol configuration lists.  Each of these MUST 
        NOT be present more than once in a particular potential configuration 
        attribute. Potential extension configuration lists can be included as 
        well; unknown potential extension configuration lists MUST be ignored 
        (if support is required, then the "a=creq" attribute with suitable 
        option tags MUST be used). There can be more than one potential 
        extension configuration list, however each particular potential 
        extension configuration list MUST NOT be present more than once in a 
        given potential configuration attribute. Together, these potential 
        configuration lists define a potential configuration.  

        There can be multiple potential configurations provided within a 
        media description. Each of these indicates not only a willingness, 
        but in fact a desire to use the potential configuration. 

        The example SDP below contains two potential configurations: 

           v=0 
           o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
           s=  
           c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
           t=0 0 
           m=audio 53456 RTP/AVP 0 18 
           a=tcap:1 RTP/SAVP RTP/SAVPF 
           a=acap:1 a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32    
              inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32  
           a=pcfg:1 t=1 a=1 
           a=pcfg:2 t=2 a=1   

        Potential configuration 1 contains a potential transport protocol 
        configuration list that references transport capability 1 
        ("RTP/SAVP") and a potential attribute configuration list that 
        references attribute capability 1 ("a=crypto:..."). Potential 
        configuration 2 contains a potential transport protocol configuration 
        list that references transport capability 2 ("RTP/SAVPF") and a 
        potential attribute configuration list that references attribute 
        capability 1 ("a=crypto:...").  

        Attribute capabilities are used in a potential configuration by use 
        of the pot-attribute-config-list parameter, which is defined by the 
        following ABNF:

        Note that white space is not permitted within this production.  

        Each potential attribute configuration list can optionally begin with 
        instructions for how to handle attributes that are part of the actual 
        configuration (i.e. the "a=" lines present in the original SDP). By 
        default, such attributes will remain as part of the configuration in 
        question. However, if delete-attributes indicates "-m", then all 
        attribute lines within the media description in question will be 
        deleted (i.e. all "a=" lines under the "m=" line in question). If 
        delete-attributes indicates "-s", then all attribute lines at the 
        session-level will be deleted (i.e. all "a=" lines before the first 
        "m=" line). If delete-attributes indicates "-ms", then all attribute 
        lines within this media description ("m=" line) and all attribute 
        lines at the session-level will be deleted.  

        The attribute capability list comes next. It contains one or more 
        alternative lists of attribute capabilities. The alternative 
        attribute capability lists are separated by a vertical bar ("|"), and 
        each list contains one or more attribute capabilities separated by 
        commas (","). The attribute capabilities are either mandatory or 
        optional. Mandatory attribute capabilities MUST be supported in order 
        to use the potential configuration, whereas optional attribute 
        capabilities MAY be supported in order to use the potential 
        configuration.

        Within each attribute capability list, all the mandatory attribute 
        capabilities (if any) are listed first, and all the optional 
        attribute capabilities (if any) are listed last. The optional 
        attribute capabilities are contained within a pair of angle brackets 
        ("[" and "]"). Each attribute capability is merely an attribute 
        capability number (att-cap-num) that identifies a particular 
        attribute capability by referring to attribute capability numbers 
        defined above and hence MUST be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included). 
        The following example illustrates the above: 

           a=pcfg:1 a=-m:1,2,[3,4]|1,7,[5] 

        where 

        o  "a=-m:1,2,[3,4]|1,7,[5]" is the potential attribute configuration 
           list  

        o  "-m" is the delete-attributes  

        o  "1,2,[3,4]" and "1,7,[5]" are both attribute capability lists. The 
           two lists are alternatives, since they are separated by a vertical 
           bar above 

        o  "1", "2" and "7" are mandatory attribute capabilities  

        o  "3", "4" and "5" are optional attribute capabilities  

        Note that in the example above, we have a single handle ("1") for the 
        potential configuration(s), but there are actually two different 
        potential configurations (separated by a vertical bar). This is done 
        for message size efficiency reasons, which is especially important 
        when we add other types of capabilities to the potential 
        configuration. If there is a need to provide a unique handle for 
        each, separate "a=pcfg" attributes with different handles must be 
        used instead.  

        Each referenced attribute capability in the potential configuration 
        will result in the corresponding attribute name and its associated 
        value (contained inside the attribute capability) being added to the 
        resulting potential configuration SDP.  

        Alternative attribute capability lists are separated by a vertical 
        bar ("|"), the scope of which extends to the next alternative (i.e. 
        "," has higher precedence than "|"). The alternatives are ordered by 
        preference with the most preferred listed first. In order for a 
        recipient of the SDP (e.g. an answerer receiving this in an offer) to 
        use this potential configuration, exactly one of the alternative

        lists must be selected in its entirety. This requires that all 
        mandatory attribute capabilities referenced by the potential 
        configuration are supported with the attribute values provided.  

        Potential transport protocol configuration lists are included in a 
        potential configuration by use of the pot-transport-protocol-config-
        list parameter, which is defined by the following ABNF: 

           pot-transport-protocol-config-list =  
                                "t=" trpr-cap-num *(BAR trpr-cap-num) 
           trpr-cap-num        = 1*DIGIT   ; defined in [RFC4234] 

        Note that white-space is not permitted within this production. 

        The trpr-cap-num refers to transport protocol capability numbers 
        defined above and hence MUST be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included). 
        Alternative potential transport protocol capabilities are separated 
        by a vertical bar ("|").  The alternatives are ordered by preference 
        with the most preferred listed first. When there are no transport 
        protocol capabilities included in a potential configuration at the 
        media level, the transport protocol information from the associated 
        "m=" line MUST be used. In order for a recipient of the SDP (e.g. an 
        answerer receiving this in an offer) to use this potential 
        configuration, exactly one of the alternatives MUST be selected. This 
        requires that the transport protocol in question is supported. 

          In the presence of intermediaries (the existence of which may not 
          be known), care should be taken with assuming that the transport 
          protocol in the "m=" line will not be modified by an intermediary. 
          Use of an explicit transport protocol capability will guard against 
          any capability negotiation implications of that.  

        Extension capabilities can be included in a potential configuration 
        as well by use of potential extension configuration lists. Such 
        potential configuration extension lists MUST adhere to the following 
        ABNF: 

           pot-extension-config-list  = ext-cap-name "="  
                                         ext-cap-list  
           ext-cap-name               = token     ; defined in [RFC4566] 
           ext-cap-list               = 1*VCHAR      ; defined in [RFC4234] 

        Note that white-space is not permitted within this production. 

        The ext-cap-name refers to the type of extension capability and the 
        ext-cap-list is here merely defined as a sequence of visible 
        characters. The actual extension supported MUST refine both of these

        further. For extension capabilities that merely need to be referenced 
        by a capability number, it is RECOMMENDED to follow a structure 
        similar to what has been specified above. Unsupported or unknown 
        potential extension configuration lists in a potential configuration 
        attribute MUST be ignored. 

          The "creq" attribute and its associated rules can be used to ensure 
          that required extensions are supported in the first place.  

        Potential configuration attributes can be provided at the media level 
        only, however it is possible to reference capabilities provided at 
        either the session or media level. There are certain semantic rules 
        and restrictions associated with this:  

        A (media level) potential configuration attribute in a given media 
        description MUST NOT reference a media-level capability provided in a 
        different media description; doing so invalidates that potential 
        configuration (note that a potential configuration attribute can 
        contain more than one potential configuration by use of 
        alternatives). A potential configuration attribute can however 
        reference a session-level capability. The semantics of doing so 
        depends on the type of capability. In the case of transport protocol 
        capabilities it has no particular implication. In the case of 
        attribute capabilities however, it does. More specifically, the 
        attribute name and value (provided within that attribute capability) 
        will be considered part of the resulting SDP for that particular 
        configuration at the *session* level. In other words, it will be as-
        if that attribute was simply provided with that value at the session-
        level in the first place. As a result of that, the base SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework REQUIRES that potential 
        configurations do not reference any session-level attribute 
        capabilities that contain media-level attributes (since that would 
        place a media-level attribute at the session level). Extensions may 
        modify this behavior, as long as it is fully backwards compatible 
        with the base specification.  

        Individual media streams perform capability negotiation individually, 
        and hence it is possible that one media stream (where the attribute 
        was part of a potential configuration) chose a configuration without 
        a session level attribute that was chosen by another media stream. 
        The session-level attribute however remains "active" and hence 
        applies to the entire resulting potential configuration SDP. In 
        theory, this is problematic if one or more session-level attributes 
        either conflicts with or potentially interacts with another session-
        level or media-level attribute in an undefined manner. In practice 
        however, such examples seem to be rare (at least with the currently 
        defined SDP attributes).

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

          A related set of problems can occur if we need coordination between 
          session-level attributes from multiple media streams in order for a 
          particular functionality to work. The grouping framework [RFC3388] 
          is an example of this. If we use the SDP Capability Negotiation 
          framework to select a session-level group attribute (provided as an 
          attribute capability), and we require two media descriptions to do 
          this consistently, we could have a problem. The FEC grouping 
          semantics [RFC4756] is one example where this in theory could cause 
          problems, however in practice, it is unclear that there is a 
          significant problem here with the currently defined grouping 
          semantics.  

        Resolving the above issues in general requires inter-media stream 
        constraints and synchronized potential configuration processing; this 
        would add considerable complexity to the overall solution. In 
        practice, with the currently defined SDP attributes, it does not seem 
        to be a significant problem, and hence the core SDP Capability 
        Negotiation solution does not provide a solution to this issue. 
        Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that use of session-level attributes in a 
        potential configuration is avoided when possible, and when not, that 
        such use is examined closely for any potential interaction issues. If 
        interaction is possible, the entity generating the SDP SHOULD NOT 
        assume that well-defined operation will occur at the receiving 
        entity.  

        The session-level operation of extension capabilities is undefined: 
        Consequently, each new session-level extension capability defined 
        MUST specify the implication of making it part of a configuration at 
        the media level.  

        Below, we provide an example of the "a=pcfg" attribute in a complete 
        media description in order to properly indicate the supporting 
        attributes: 

           v=0

        We have two potential configuration attributes listed here. The first 
        one (and most preferred, since its configuration number is "1") 
        indicates that either of the profiles RTP/SAVPF or RTP/SAVP 
        (specified by the transport protocol capability numbers 4 and 3) can 
        be supported with attribute capability 1 (the "crypto" attribute); 
        RTP/SAVPF is preferred over RTP/SAVP since its capability number (4) 
        is listed first in the preferred potential configuration. Note that 
        while we have only a single potential attribute and associated 
        handle, we have two potential configurations.  

        The second potential configuration attribute indicates that the 
        RTP/AVPF or RTP/AVP profile can be used, with RTP/AVPF being the 
        preferred one. This non secure RTP alternative is the less preferred 
        one since its configuration number is "8". Again, note that we have 
        two potential configurations here and hence a total of four potential 
        configurations in the SDP above.  

     3.6.2. Actual Configuration Attribute 

        The actual configuration attribute identifies which of the potential 
        configurations from an offer SDP was selected and used as the actual 
        configuration to generate an answer SDP.  This is done by including 
        the configuration number and the configuration lists (if any) from 
        the offer that were selected and used by the answerer in his 
        offer/answer procedure as follows: 

        o  A selected potential attribute configuration MUST include the 
           delete-attributes and the selected alternative mo-att-cap-list 
           (i.e. containing all mandatory and optional capability numbers 
           from the potential configuration, irrespective of whether the 
           optional ones were supported or not). If delete-attributes were 
           not included in the potential configuration, they will of course 
           not be present here either.  

        o  A selected potential transport protocol configuration MUST include 
           the selected transport protocol capability number.  

        o  A selected potential extension configuration MUST include the 
           selected extension configuration parameters as specified for that 
           particular extension.  

        Note that the selected configuration number and all selected 
        capability numbers used in the actual configuration attribute refer 
        to those from the offer; not the answer.  

          The answer may for example include capabilities as well to inform 
          the offerer of the answerers capabilities above and beyond the

          negotiated configuration. The actual configuration attribute does 
          not refer to any of those answer capabilities though.  

        The Actual Configuration Attribute ("a=acfg") is defined as follows:  

           a=acfg: <config-number> [<sel-cfg-list>] 

        where <config-number> is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both 
        included). 

        The "acfg" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
        with an att-value defined as follows: 

           att-value      = config-number [1*WSP sel-cfg-list] 
                             ;config-number defined in Section 3.6.1.  
           sel-cfg-list   = sel-cfg *(1*WSP sel-cfg) 
           sel-cfg        = sel-attribute-config / 
                                sel-transport-protocol-config / 
                                sel-extension-config 
         
           sel-attribute-config =  
                    "a=" [delete-attributes ":"] mo-att-cap-list 
                                         ; defined in Section 3.6.1.  
         
           sel-transport-protocol-config = 
                    "t=" trpr-cap-num    ; defined in Section 3.6.1.  
         
           sel-extension-config = 
                    ext-cap-name "=" 1*VCHAR   ; defined in Section 3.6.1.  

        Note that white-space is not permitted before the config-number.  

        The actual configuration ("a=acfg") attribute can be provided at the  
        media-level only. There MUST NOT be more than one occurrence of an 
        actual configuration attribute within a given media description.  

        Below, we provide an example of the "a=acfg" attribute (building on 
        the previous example with the potential configuration attribute):

        It indicates that the answerer used an offer consisting of potential 
        configuration number 1 with transport protocol capability 4 from the 
        offer (RTP/SAVPF) and attribute capability 1 (the "crypto" 
        attribute). The answerer includes his own "crypto" attribute as well.  

     3.7. Offer/Answer Model Extensions 

        In this section, we define extensions to the offer/answer model 
        defined in [RFC3264] to allow for potential configurations to be 
        included in an offer, where they constitute offers that may be 
        accepted by the answerer instead of the actual configuration(s) 
        included in the "m=" line(s).  

        The procedures defined in the following subsections apply to both 
        unicast and multicast streams.  

     3.7.1. Generating the Initial Offer 

        An offerer that wants to use the SDP Capability Negotiation defined 
        in this document MUST include the following in the offer:

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        o  An attribute capability attribute ("a=acap") as defined in Section 
           3.5.1. for each attribute name and associated value (if any) that 
           needs to be indicated as a capability in the offer.  
            
           Session-level attributes and associated values MUST be provided in 
           attribute capabilities at the session-level only, whereas media-
           level attributes and associated values can be provided in 
           attribute capabilities at either the media-level or session-level. 
           Attributes that can be provided at either the session- or media-
           level can be represented as attribute capabilities at either the 
           session- or media-level. Attribute capabilities for 
           '<type>=<value>' attributes MAY include an attribute name only, 
           thereby merely indicating support for the attribute type; such 
           attribute capabilities MUST NOT be referenced by a potential 
           configuration. If there is not a need to indicate any attributes 
           as attribute capabilities, then there will not be any "a=acap" 
           attributes either. 

        o  One or more a transport protocol capability attributes ("a=tcap") 
           as defined in Section 3.5.2. with values for each transport 
           protocol that needs to be indicated as a capability in the offer. 
           Transport protocol capabilities that apply to multiple media 
           descriptions SHOULD be provided at the session-level whereas 
           transport protocol capabilities that apply to a specific media 
           description ("m=" line) only, SHOULD be provided within that 
           particular media description. In either case, there MUST NOT be 
           more than a single "a=tcap" attribute at the session-level and a 
           single "a=tcap" attribute in each media description. If there is 
           not a need to indicate any transport protocols as transport 
           protocol capabilities, then there will not be any "a=tcap" 
           attributes either. 

        o  One or more extension capability attributes (as outlined in 
           Section 3.5.3. ) for each extension capability that is referenced 
           by a potential configuration.  

        o  One or more potential configuration attributes ("a=pcfg") as 
           defined in Section 3.6.1. within each media description where 
           alternative potential configurations are to be negotiated. Each 
           potential configuration attribute MUST adhere to the rules 
           provided in Section 3.6.1. and the additional rules provided 
           below.  

        If the offerer requires support for more or extensions (besides the 
        base protocol defined here), then the offerer MUST include one or 
        more "a=creq" attribute as follows:

        o  If one or more capability negotiation extensions are required to 
           be supported for the entire session description, then option tags 
           for those extensions MUST be included in a single session-level 
           "creq" attribute.  

        o  For each media description that requires one or more capability 
           negotiation extensions not listed at the session-level, a single 
           "creq" attribute containing all the required extensions for that 
           media description MUST be included within the media description 
           (in accordance with Section 3.4.2. ).  

        The offerer SHOULD furthermore include the following: 

        o  A supported capability negotiation extension attribute ("a=csup") 
           at the session-level and/or media-level as defined in Section 
           3.4.2. for each capability negotiation extension supported by the 
           offerer and not included in a corresponding "a=creq" attribute 
           (i.e. at the session-level or in the same media description). 
           Option tags provided in a "a=csup" attribute at the session-level 
           indicate extensions supported for the entire session description 
           whereas option tags provided in a "a=csup" attribute in a media 
           description indicate extensions supported for that particular 
           media description only.  

        Capabilities provided in an offer merely indicate what the offerer is 
        capable of doing. They do not constitute a commitment or even an 
        indication to use them. In contrast, each potential configuration 
        constitutes an alternative offer that the offerer would like to use. 
        The potential configurations MUST be used by the answerer to 
        negotiate and establish the session.   

        The offerer MUST include one or more potential configuration 
        attributes ("a=pcfg") within each media description where the offerer 
        wants to provide alternative offers (in the form of potential 
        configurations). Each potential configuration attribute in a given 
        media description MUST contain a unique configuration number and one 
        or more potential configuration lists, as described in Section 3.6.1. 
        Each potential configuration list MUST refer to capabilities that are 
        provided either at the session-level or within that particular media 
        description; otherwise, the potential configuration is considered 
        invalid. The base SDP Capability Negotiation framework REQUIRES that 
        potential configurations do not reference any session-level attribute 
        capabilities that contain media-level attributes, however extensions 
        may modify this behavior, as long as it is fully backwards compatible 
        with the base specification. Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that 
        potential configurations avoid use of session-level capabilities 
        whenever possible; refer to Section 3.6.1.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        The current actual configuration is included in the "m=" line (as 
        defined by [RFC3264]) and the various attribute ("a=") lines. Note 
        that the actual configuration is by definition the least-preferred 
        configuration, and hence the answerer will seek to negotiate use of 
        one of the potential configurations instead. If the offerer wishes a 
        different preference for the actual configuration, the offerer MUST 
        include a corresponding potential configuration with the relevant 
        configuration number (which indicates the relative preference between 
        potential configurations); this corresponding potential configuration 
        should simply duplicate the actual configuration.  

          This can either be done implicitly (by not referencing any 
          capabilities), or explicitly (by providing and using capabilities 
          for the transport protocol and all the attributes that are part of 
          the actual configuration). The latter may help detect 
          intermediaries that modify the actual configuration but are not SDP 
          Capability Negotiation aware.  

        Per [RFC3264], once the offerer generates the offer, he must be 
        prepared to receive incoming media in accordance with that offer. 
        That rule applies here as well, but for the actual configurations 
        provided in the offer only: Media received by the offerer according 
        to one of the potential configurations MAY be discarded, until the 
        offerer receives an answer indicating what the actual selected 
        configuration is. Once that answer is received, incoming media MUST 
        be processed in accordance with the actual selected configuration 
        indicated and the answer received (provided the offer/answer exchange 
        completed successfully).   

        The above rule assumes that the offerer can determine whether 
        incoming media adheres to the actual configuration offered or one of 
        the potential configurations instead; this may not always be the 
        case. If the offerer wants to ensure he does not play out any 
        garbage, the offerer SHOULD discard all media received before the 
        answer SDP is received. Conversely, if the offerer wants to avoid 
        clipping, he should attempt to play any incoming media as soon as it 
        is received (at the risk of playing out garbage). For further 
        details, please refer to Section 3.10.  

     3.7.2. Generating the Answer  

        When receiving an offer, the answerer MUST check for the presence of 
        a required capability negotiation extension attribute ("a=creq") 
        provided at the session level. If one is found, then capability 
        negotiation MUST be performed. If none is found, then the answerer 
        MUST check each offered media description for the presence of a 
        required capability negotiation extension attribute ("a=creq") and

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        one or more potential configuration attributes ("a=pcfg"). Capability 
        negotiation MUST be performed for each media description where either 
        of those is present in accordance with the procedures described 
        below.  

        The answerer MUST first ensure that it supports any required 
        capability negotiation extensions:  

        o  If a session-level "creq" attribute is provided, and it contains 
           an option-tag that the answerer does not support, then the 
           answerer MUST NOT use any of the potential configuration 
           attributes provided for any of the media descriptions. Instead, 
           the normal offer/answer procedures MUST continue as per [RFC3264]. 
           Furthermore, the answerer MUST include a session-level supported 
           capability negotiation extensions attribute ("a=csup") with option 
           tags for the capability negotiation extensions supported by the 
           answerer.  

        o  If a media-level "creq" attribute is provided, and it contains an 
           option tag that the answerer does not support, then the answerer 
           MUST NOT use any of the potential configuration attributes 
           provided for that particular media description. Instead, the 
           offer/answer procedures for that media description MUST continue 
           as per [RFC3264] (SDP Capability Negotiation is still performed 
           for other media descriptions in the SDP).  Furthermore, the 
           answerer MUST include a supported capability negotiation 
           extensions attribute ("a=csup") in that media description with 
           option tags for the capability negotiation extensions supported by 
           the answerer for that media description. 

        Assuming all required capability negotiation extensions are 
        supported, the answerer now proceeds as follows.  

        For each media description where capability negotiation is to be 
        performed (i.e. all required capability negotiation extensions are 
        supported and at least one valid potential configuration attribute is 
        present), the answerer MUST attempt to perform capability negotiation 
        by using the most preferred potential configuration that is valid. A 
        potential configuration is valid if: 

        1. It is in accordance with the syntax and semantics provided in 
           Section 3.6.1.  

        2. It contains a configuration number that is unique within that 
           media description.

        3. All attribute capabilities referenced by the potential 
           configuration are valid themselves (as defined in Section 3.5.1. ) 
           and each of them is provided either at the session-level or within 
           this particular media description. For session-level attribute 
           capabilities referenced, the attributes contained inside them MUST 
           NOT be media-level only attributes.  

        4. All transport protocol capabilities referenced by the potential 
           configuration are valid themselves (as defined in Section 3.5.2. ) 
           and each of them is furthermore provided either at the session-
           level or within this particular media description.  

        5. All extension capabilities referenced by the potential 
           configuration and supported by the answerer are valid themselves 
           (as defined by that particular extension) and each of them are 
           furthermore provided either at the session-level or within this 
           particular media description. Unknown or unsupported extension 
           capabilities MUST be ignored.  

        The most preferred valid potential configuration in a media 
        description is the valid potential configuration with the lowest 
        configuration number. The answerer MUST now process the offer for 
        that media stream based on the most preferred valid potential 
        configuration. Conceptually, this entails the answerer constructing 
        an (internal) offer that consists of the actual configuration offer 
        SDP, with the following changes for each media stream offered: 

        o  If a transport protocol capability is included in the potential 
           configuration, then it replaces the transport protocol provided in 
           the "m=" line for that media description.  

        o  If attribute capabilities are present with a delete-attributes 
           session indication ("-s"), then all session-level attributes from 
           the actual configuration SDP MUST be deleted in accordance with 
           the procedures in Section 3.6.1. If attribute capabilities are 
           present with a delete-attributes media indication ("-m"), then all 
           attributes from the actual configuration SDP inside this media 
           description MUST be deleted.  

        o  If a session-level attribute capability is included, the attribute 
           (and its associated value, if any) contained in it MUST be added 
           to the resulting SDP. All such added session-level attributes MUST 
           be listed before the session-level attributes that were initially 
           present in the SDP. Furthermore, the added session-level 
           attributes MUST be added in the order they were provided in the 
           potential configuration (see also Section 3.6.1. ).

              This allows for attributes with implicit preference ordering to 
              be added in the desired order; the "crypto" attribute [SDES] is 
              one such example.  

        o  If a media-level attribute capability is included, then the 
           attribute (and its associated value, if any) MUST be added to the 
           resulting SDP within the media description in question. All such 
           added media-level attributes MUST be listed before the media-level 
           attributes that were initially present in the SDP in the media 
           description in question. Furthermore, the added media-level 
           attributes MUST be added in the order they were provided in the 
           potential configuration (see also Section 3.6.1. ). 

        o  If a supported extension capability is included, then it MUST be 
           processed in accordance with the rules provided for that 
           particular extension capability.  

        Note that whereas a transport protocol from the potential 
        configuration replaces the transport protocol in the actual 
        configuration, an attribute capability from the potential 
        configuration is simply added to the actual configuration. In some 
        cases, this can result in having one or more meaningless attributes 
        in the resulting potential configuration SDP, or worse, ambiguous or 
        potentially even illegal attributes. The delete-attributes for the 
        session and/or media level attributes MUST be used to avoid such 
        scenarios. Nevertheless, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations 
        ignore meaningless attributes that may result from potential 
        configurations.  

          For example, if the actual configuration was using Secure RTP and 
          included an "a=crypto" attribute for the SRTP keying material, then 
          use of a potential configuration that uses plain RTP would make the 
          "crypto" attribute meaningless. The answerer may or may not ignore 
          such a meaningless attribute. The offerer can here ensure correct 
          operation by using the delete-attributes to actually delete the 
          crypto attribute (but will then need to provide attribute 
          capabilities to reconstruct the SDP with the necessary attributes 
          deleted, e.g. rtpmaps).  

        Please refer to Section 3.7.2.1. for examples of how the answerer may 
        conceptually "see" the resulting offered alternative potential 
        configurations.  

        The answerer MUST check that he supports all mandatory attribute 
        capabilities from the potential configuration (if any) and the 
        transport protocol capability (if any) from the potential 
        configuration. If he does not, the answerer MUST proceed to the

        second-most preferred valid potential configuration for the media 
        description, etc.  

        If the answerer has exhausted all potential configurations for the 
        media description, without finding a valid one that is also 
        supported, then the answerer MUST process the offered media stream 
        based on the actual configuration plus any session-level attributes 
        added by a valid and supported potential configuration for another 
        media description in the offered SDP.  

        The above process describes potential configuration selection as a 
        per media stream process. Inter-media stream coordination of selected 
        potential configurations however is required in some cases. First of 
        all, session-level attributes added by a potential configuration for 
        one media description MUST NOT cause any problems for potential 
        configurations selected by other media descriptions in the offer SDP. 
        If the session-level attributes are mandatory, then those session-
        level attributes MUST furthermore be supported by the session as a 
        whole (i.e. all the media descriptions if relevant). As mentioned 
        earlier, this adds additional complexity to the overall processing 
        and hence it is RECOMMENDED not to use session-level attribute 
        capabilities in potential configurations, unless absolutely 
        necessary.  

        Once the answerer has selected a valid and supported offered 
        configuration for all of the media streams (or has fallen back to the 
        actual configuration plus any added session attributes), the answerer 
        MUST generate a valid answer SDP based on the selected potential 
        configuration SDP, as "seen" by the answerer (see Section 3.7.2.1. 
        for examples). Furthermore, if the answerer selected one of the 
        potential configurations in a media description, the answerer MUST 
        include an actual configuration attribute ("a=acfg") within that 
        media description that identifies the configuration number for the 
        selected potential configuration as well as the actual parameters 
        that were used from that potential configuration (if the potential 
        configuration included alternatives, only the selected alternatives 
        must be included). Only the known and supported parameters will be 
        included. Unknown or unsupported parameters MUST NOT be included in 
        the actual configuration attribute.  

          This is not to be confused with mandatory and optional attribute 
          capabilities, where some of the optional attribute capabilities may 
          refer to unknown or unsupported attributes. The entire list of 
          attribute capabilities still need to be included thereby enabling 
          the offerer to determine which alternative potential configuration 
          was chosen by the answerer.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        If the answerer supports one or more capability negotiation 
        extensions that were not included in a required capability 
        negotiation extensions attribute in the offer, then the answerer 
        SHOULD furthermore include a supported capability negotiation 
        attribute ("a=csup") at the session-level with option tags for the 
        extensions supported across media streams. Also, if the answerer 
        supports one or more capability negotiation extensions for particular 
        media descriptions only, then a supported capability negotiation 
        attribute with those option-tags SHOULD be included within each 
        relevant media description.  

        The offerer's originally provided actual configuration is contained 
        in the media description's "m=" line (and associated parameters). The 
        answerer MAY send media to the offerer in accordance with that actual 
        configuration as soon as it receives the offer, however it MUST NOT 
        send media based on that actual configuration if it selects an 
        alternative potential configuration. If the answerer selects one of 
        the potential configurations, then the answerer MAY immediately start 
        to send media to the offerer in accordance with the selected 
        potential configuration, however the offerer MAY discard such media 
        or play out garbage until the offerer receives the answer. Please 
        refer to section 3.10. for additional considerations and possible 
        alternative solutions outside the base SDP Capability Negotiation 
        framework.  

        If the offerer selected a potential configuration instead of the 
        actual configuration, then it is RECOMMENDED that the answerer sends 
        back an answer SDP as soon as possible. This minimizes the risk of 
        having media discarded or played out as garbage by the offerer. In 
        the case of SIP [RFC3261] without any extensions, this implies that 
        if the offer was received in an INVITE message, then the answer SDP 
        should be provided in the first non-100 provisional response sent 
        back (per RFC3261, the answer would need to be repeated in the 200 
        response as well, unless a relevant extension such as [RFC3262] is 
        being used). 

     3.7.2.1. Example Views of Potential Configurations 

        The following examples illustrate how the answerer may conceptually 
        "see" a potential configuration. Consider the following offered SDP:

        This particular SDP offers an audio stream and a video stream, each 
        of which can either use plain RTP (actual configuration) or secure 
        RTP (potential configuration). Furthermore, two different keying 
        mechanisms are offered, namely session-level Key Management 
        Extensions using MIKEY (attribute capability 1) and media-level SDP 
        Security Descriptions (attribute capabilities 2 and 3). There are 
        several potential configurations here, however, below we show the one 
        the answerer "sees" when using potential configuration 1 for both 
        audio and video, and furthermore using attribute capability 1 (MIKEY) 
        for both (we have removed all the capability negotiation attributes 
        for clarity):

     3.7.3.  Offerer Processing of the Answer  

        When the offerer attempted to use SDP Capability Negotiation in the 
        offer, the offerer MUST examine the answer for actual use of SDP 
        Capability Negotiation.  

        For each media description where the offerer included a potential 
        configuration attribute ("a=pcfg"), the offerer MUST first examine 
        the media description for the presence of an actual configuration 
      
      
     Andreasen              Expires January 8, 2008                [Page 39] 
         







     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        attribute ("a=acfg"). If an actual configuration attribute is not 
        present in a media description, then the offerer MUST process the 
        answer SDP for that media stream per the normal offer/answer rules 
        defined in [RFC3264]. However, if one is found, the offerer MUST 
        instead process the answer as follows: 

        o  The actual configuration attribute specifies which of the 
           potential configurations was used by the answerer to generate the 
           answer for this media stream. This includes all the capabilities 
           referenced by the potential configuration selected, i.e. the 
           attribute capabilities and any associated delete-attributes, 
           transport protocol capabilities, and any extension capability 
           parameters included.  

        o  The offerer MUST now process the answer in accordance with the 
           rules in [RFC3264], except that it must be done as if the offer 
           consisted of the selected potential configuration instead of the 
           actual configuration, including any transport protocol changes in 
           the media ("m=") line(s), attributes added and deleted by the 
           potential configuration at the media and session level, and any 
           extensions used.  

        If the offer/answer exchange was successful, and if the answerer 
        selected one of the potential configurations from the offer as the 
        actual configuration, then the offerer MAY perform another 
        offer/answer exchange: This new offer SHOULD contain the selected 
        potential configuration as the actual configuration, i.e. with the 
        actual configuration used in the "m=" line and any other relevant 
        attributes and extensions. This second offer/answer exchange will not 
        modify the session in any way, however it will help intermediaries 
        (e.g. middleboxes) that look at the SDP, but do not understand or 
        support the capability negotiation extensions, to understand the 
        details of the media stream(s) that were actually negotiated. If it 
        is known or suspected that one or more such intermediaries exist, 
        then this second offer/answer SHOULD be performed (this is already 
        done when using Interactive Connectivity Establishment [ICE], and in 
        those cases, there will not be a need for a third offer/answer 
        exchange). Note that, per normal offer/answer rules, the second 
        offer/answer exchange still needs to update the version number in the 
        "o=" line ((<sess-version> in [RFC4566]). Attribute lines carrying 
        keying material SHOULD repeat the keys from the previous offer, 
        unless re-keying is necessary, e.g. due to a previously forked SIP 
        INVITE request. Please refer to Section 3.12. for additional 
        considerations related to intermediaries.

     3.7.4. Modifying the Session        

        Capabilities and potential configurations may be included in 
        subsequent offers as defined in [RFC3264], Section 8.  The procedure 
        for doing so is similar to that described above with the answer 
        including an indication of the actual selected configuration used by 
        the answerer.  

        If the answer indicates use of a potential configuration from the 
        offer, then the guidelines provided in Section 3.7.3. for doing a 
        second offer/answer exchange using that potential configuration as 
        the actual configuration apply.  

     3.8. Interactions with ICE 

        Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [ICE] provides a 
        mechanism for verifying connectivity between two endpoints by sending 
        STUN messages directly between the media endpoints. The basic ICE 
        specification [ICE] is defined to support UDP-based connectivity 
        only, however it allows for extensions to support other transport 
        protocols, such as TCP, which is being specified in [ICETCP]. ICE 
        defines a new "a=candidate" attribute, which, among other things, 
        indicates the possible transport protocol(s) to use and then 
        associates a priority with each of them. The most preferred transport 
        protocol that *successfully* verifies connectivity will end up being 
        used.  

        When using ICE, it is thus possible that the transport protocol that 
        will be used differs from what is specified in the "m=" line. 
        Furthermore, since both ICE and SDP Capability Negotiation may now 
        specify alternative transport protocols, there is a potentially 
        unintended interaction when using these together.  

        We provide the following guidelines for addressing that.  

        There are two basic scenarios to consider here: 

        1) A particular media stream can run over different transport 
        protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP, or TCP/TLS), and the intent is simply to 
        use the one that works (in the preference order specified).  

        2) A particular media stream can run over different transport 
        protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP, or TCP/TLS) and the intent is to have the 
        negotiation process decide which one to use (e.g. T.38 over TCP or 
        UDP).  
         
        In scenario 1, there should be ICE "a=candidate" attributes for UDP, 
      
      
     Andreasen              Expires January 8, 2008                [Page 41] 
         







     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        TCP, etc. but otherwise nothing special in the potential 
        configuration attributes to indicate the desire to use different 
        transport protocols (e.g. UDP, or TCP). The ICE procedures 
        essentially cover the capability negotiation required (by having the 
        answerer select something it supports and then use of trial and 
        error).  
         
        Scenario 2 does not require a need to support or use ICE. Instead, we 
        simply use transport protocol capabilities and potential 
        configuration attributes to indicate the desired outcome.  

        The scenarios may be combined, e.g. by offering potential 
        configuration alternatives where some of them can support one 
        transport protocol only (e.g. UDP), whereas others can support 
        multiple transport protocols (e.g. UDP or TCP). In that case, there 
        is a need for tight control over the ICE candidates that will 
        actually be used for a particular configuration, yet the actual 
        configuration may want to use all of them. In that case, the ICE 
        candidate attributes can be defined as attribute capabilities and the 
        relevant ones should then be included in the proper potential 
        configurations (for example candidate attributes for UDP only for 
        potential configurations that are restricted to UDP, whereas there 
        could be candidate attributes for UDP, TCP, and TCP/TLS for potential 
        configurations that can use all three). Furthermore, use of the 
        delete-attributes in a potential configuration can be used to ensure 
        that ICE will not end up using a transport protocol that is not 
        desired. 

     3.9. Interactions with SIP Option Tags 

        SIP [RFC3261] allows for SIP extensions to define a SIP option tag 
        that identifies the SIP extension. Support for one or more such 
        extensions can be indicated by use of the SIP Supported header, and 
        required support for one or more such extensions can be indicated by 
        use of the SIP Require header. The "a=csup" and "a=creq" attributes 
        defined by the SDP Capability Negotiation framework are similar, 
        except that support for these two attributes by themselves cannot be 
        guaranteed (since they are specified as extensions to the SDP 
        specification [RFC4566] itself).  

        SIP extensions with associated option tags can introduce enhancements 
        to not only SIP, but also SDP. This is for example the case for SIP 
        preconditions defined in [RFC3312]. When using SDP Capability 
        Negotiation, some potential configurations may include certain SDP 
        extensions, whereas others may not. Since the purpose of the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation is to negotiate a session based on the 
        features supported by both sides, use of the SIP Require header for 
      
      
     Andreasen              Expires January 8, 2008                [Page 42] 
         







     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        such extensions may not produce the desired result. For example, if 
        one potential configuration requires SIP precondition support, 
        another does not, and the answerer does not support preconditions, 
        then use of the SIP Require header for preconditions would result in 
        a session failure, in spite of the fact that a valid and supported 
        potential configuration was included in the offer.  

        In general, this can be alleviated by use of mandatory and optional 
        attribute capabilities in a potential configuration. There are 
        however cases where permissible SDP values are tied to the use of the 
        SIP Require header. SIP preconditions [RFC3312] is one such example, 
        where preconditions with a "mandatory" strength-tag can only be used 
        when a SIP Require header with the SIP option tag "precondition" is 
        included. Future SIP extensions that may want to use the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework should avoid such coupling.  

     3.10. Processing Media before Answer 

        The offer/answer model requires an offerer to be able to receive 
        media in accordance with the offer prior to receiving the answer. 
        This property is retained with the SDP Capability Negotiation 
        extensions defined here, but only when the actual configuration is 
        selected by the answerer. If a potential configuration is chosen, it 
        is permissible for the offerer to not process any media received 
        before the answer is received. This however may lead to clipping. 
        Consequently, the SDP Capability Negotiation framework recommends 
        sending back an answer SDP as soon as possible.  

        The issue can be resolved by introducing a three-way handshake. In 
        the case of SIP, this can for example be done by defining a 
        precondition [RFC3312] for capability negotiation (or use an existing 
        precondition that is known to generate a second offer/answer exchange 
        before proceeding with the session), however preconditions are often 
        viewed as complicated to implement and they may add to overall 
        session establishment delay by requiring an extra offer/answer 
        exchange.  

        An alternative three-way handshake can be performed by use of ICE 
        [ICE]. When ICE is being used, and the answerer receives a STUN 
        Binding Request for any one of the accepted media streams from the 
        offerer, the answerer knows the offer has received his answer. At 
        that point, the answerer knows that the offerer will be able to 
        process incoming media according to the negotiated configuration and 
        hence he can start sending media without the risk of the offerer 
        either discarding it or playing garbage.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        In some use cases (notably, when the offerer does not need 
        information from the answer, such as keying material in the SDP, in 
        order to process incoming media), a three-way handshake is not 
        needed. The SDP Capability Negotiation framework does not define any 
        such solutions, however extensions may do so. For example, one 
        technique proposed for best-effort SRTP in [BESRTP] is to provide 
        different RTP payload type mappings for different transport protocols 
        used, outside of the actual configuration, while still allowing them 
        to be used by the answerer (exchange of keying material is still 
        needed, e.g. inband). The basic SDP Capability Negotiation framework 
        defined here does not include the ability to do so, however 
        extensions that enable that may be defined.  

     3.11. Dealing with Large Number of Potential Configurations 

        When using the SDP Capability Negotiation, it is easy to generate 
        offers that contain a large number of potential configurations. For 
        example, in the offer: 

           v=0 
           o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
           s=  
           c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
           t=0 0 
           m=audio 53456 RTP/AVP 0 18  
           a=tcap:1 RTP/SAVPF RTP/SAVP RTP/AVPF  
           a=acap:1 a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80               
              inline:WVNfX19zZW1jdGwgKCkgewkyMjA7fQp9CnVubGVz|2^20|1:4  
              FEC_ORDER=FEC_SRTP 
           a=acap:2 a=key-mgmt:mikey AQAFgM0XflABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsAyO...    
           a=acap:3 a=rtcp-fb:0 nack 
           a=pcfg:1 t=1 a=1,3|2,3 
           a=pcfg:2 t=2 a=1|2 
           a=pcfg:3 t=3 a=3   

        we have 5 potential configurations on top of the actual configuration 
        for a single media stream. Adding an extension capability with just 
        two alternatives for each would double that number (to 10), and doing 
        the equivalent with two media streams would again double that number 
        (to 20). While it is easy (and inexpensive) for the offerer to 
        generate such offers, processing them at the answering side may not 
        be. Consequently, it is RECOMMENDED that offerers do not create 
        offers with unnecessarily large number of potential configurations in 
        them.  

        On the answering side, implementers MUST take care to avoid excessive 
        memory and CPU consumption. For example, a nave implementation that 
      
      
     Andreasen              Expires January 8, 2008                [Page 44] 
         







     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        first generates all the valid potential configuration SDPs 
        internally, could find itself being memory exhausted, especially if 
        it supports a large number of endpoints. Similarly, a nave 
        implementation that simply performs iterative trial-and-error 
        processing on each possible potential configuration SDP (in the 
        preference order specified) could find itself being CPU constrained. 
        An alternative strategy is to prune the search space first by 
        discarding the set of offered potential configurations where the 
        transport protocol indicated (if any) is not supported, and/or one or 
        more mandatory attribute capabilities (if any) are either not 
        supported or not valid.  

     3.12. SDP Capability Negotiation and Intermediaries 

        An intermediary is here defined as an entity between a SIP user agent 
        A and a SIP user agent B, that need to perform some kind of 
        processing on the SDP exchanged between A and B in order for the 
        session establishment to operate as intended. Examples of such 
        intermediaries include Session Border Controllers (SBCs) that may 
        perform media relaying, Proxy Call Session Control Functions (P-CSCF) 
        that may authorize use of a certain amount of network resources 
        (bandwidth), etc. The presence and design of such intermediaries may 
        not follow the "Internet" model or the SIP requirements for proxies 
        (which are not supposed to look in message bodies such as SDP), 
        however they are a fact of life in some deployment scenarios 
        currently and hence deserves consideration.  

        If the intermediary needs to understand the characteristics of the 
        media sessions being negotiated, e.g. the amount of bandwidth used or 
        the transport protocol negotiated, then use of the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation framework may impact them. For example, some 
        intermediaries are known to (currently) disallow answers where the 
        transport protocol differs from the one in the offer. Use of the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework in the presence of such 
        intermediaries could lead to session failures. Intermediaries that 
        need to authorize use of network resources based on the negotiated 
        media stream parameters are affected as well. If they inspect only 
        the offer, then they may authorize parameters assuming a different 
        transport protocol, codecs, etc. than what is actually being 
        negotiated. For these, and other, reasons it is RECOMMENDED that 
        implementers of intermediaries add support for the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation framework.  

        The SDP Capability Negotiation framework itself attempts to help out 
        these intermediaries as well, by optionally performing a second 
        offer/answer exchange when use of a potential configuration has been 
        negotiated (see Section 3.7.3. ). However, there are several 
      
      
     Andreasen              Expires January 8, 2008                [Page 45] 
         







     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        limitations with this approach. First of all, the second offer/answer 
        exchange is not required and hence may not be performed. Secondly, 
        the intermediary may refuse the initial answer, e.g. due to perceived 
        transport protocol mismatch. Thirdly, the strategy is not foolproof, 
        since the offer/answer procedures [RFC3264] leave the original 
        offer/answer exchange in effect when a subsequent one fails; consider 
        the following example: 

        1. Offerer generates an SDP offer with the actual configuration 
           specifying a low bandwidth configuration (e.g. plain RTP) and a 
           potential configuration specifying a high(er) bandwidth 
           configuration (e.g. secure RTP with integrity).  

        2. An intermediary (e.g. an SBC or P-CSCF), that does not support SDP 
           Capability Negotiation, authorizes the session based on the actual 
           configuration it sees in the SDP. 

        3. The answerer chooses the high(er) bandwidth potential 
           configuration and generates an answer SDP based on that.  

        4. The intermediary passes through the answer SDP.  

        5. The offerer sees the accepted answer, and generates an updated 
           offer that contains the selected potential configuration as the 
           actual configuration. In other words, the high(er) bandwidth 
           configuration (which has already been negotiated successfully) is 
           now the actual configuration in the offer SDP.  

        6. The intermediary sees the new offer, however it does not authorize 
           the use of the high(er) bandwidth configuration, and consequently 
           generates a rejection message to the offerer.  

        7. The offerer receives the rejected offer.   

        After step 7, per RFC 3264, the offer/answer exchange that completed 
        in step 5 remains in effect, however the intermediary may not have 
        authorized the necessary network resources and hence the media stream 
        may experience quality issues. The solution to this problem is to 
        upgrade the intermediary to support the SDP Capability Negotiation 
        framework.  

     3.13. Considerations for Specific Attribute Capabilities  

     3.13.1. The rtpmap and fmtp Attributes 

        The core SDP Capability Negotiation framework defines transport 
        capabilities and attribute capabilities. Media capabilities, which

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        can be used to describe media formats and their associated 
        parameters, are not defined in this document, however the "rtpmap" 
        and "fmtp" attributes can nevertheless be used as attribute 
        capabilities. Using such attribute capabilities in a potential 
        configuration requires a bit of care though.  

        The rtpmap parameter binds an RTP payload type to a media format 
        (e.g. codec). While it is possible to provide rtpmaps for payload 
        types not found in the corresponding "m=" line, such rtpmaps provide 
        no value in normal offer/answer exchanges, since only the payload 
        types found in the "m=" line are part of the offer (or answer). This 
        applies to the core SDP Capability Negotiation framework as well: 
        Only the media formats (e.g. RTP payload types) provided in the "m=" 
        line are actually offered; inclusion of rtpmap attributes with other 
        RTP payload types in a potential configuration does not change this 
        fact and hence they do not provide any useful information there. They 
        may still be useful as pure capabilities though (outside a potential 
        configuration) in order to inform a peer of additional codec 
        supported.  

        It is possible to provide an rtpmap attribute capability with a 
        payload type mapping to a different codec than a corresponding actual 
        configuration "rtpmap" attribute for the media description has. Such 
        practice is permissible as a way of indicating a capability. If that 
        capability is included in a potential configuration, then delete-
        attributes (see Section 3.6.1. ) MUST be used to ensure that there is 
        not multiple rtpmap attributes for the same payload type in a given 
        media description (which would not be allowed by SDP [RFC4566]).  

        Similar considerations and rules apply to the "fmtp" attribute. An 
        fmtp attribute capability for a media format not included in the "m=" 
        line is useless in a potential configuration (but may be useful as a 
        capability by itself). An fmtp attribute capability in a potential 
        configuration for a media format that already has an fmtp attribute 
        in the actual configuration may lead to multiple fmtp format 
        parameters for that media format and that is not allowed by SDP 
        [RFC4566]. The delete-attributes MUST be used to ensure that there is 
        not multiple fmtp attributes for a given media format in a media 
        description.  

        Extensions to the core SDP Capability Negotiation framework may 
        change the above behavior.  

     3.13.2. Direction Attributes 

        SDP defines the "inactive", "sendonly", "recvonly", and "sendrecv" 
        direction attributes. The direction attributes can be applied at

        either the session-level or the media-level. In either case, it is 
        possible to define attribute capabilities for these direction 
        capabilities. Note that if used by a potential configuration, then 
        the normal offer/answer procedures still apply. For example, if an 
        offered potential configuration includes the "sendonly" direction 
        attribute, and it is selected as the actual configuration, then the 
        answer MUST include a corresponding "recvonly" (or "inactive") 
        attribute.  

     4. Examples 

        In this section, we provide examples showing how to use the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation.  

     4.1. Best-Effort Secure RTP 

        The following example illustrates how to use the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation extensions to support so-called Best-Effort Secure RTP. 
        In that scenario, the offerer supports both RTP and Secure RTP. If 
        the answerer does not support secure RTP (or the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation extensions), an RTP session will be established. However, 
        if the answerer supports Secure RTP and the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation extensions, a Secure RTP session will be established.  

        The best-effort Secure RTP negotiation is illustrated by the 
        offer/answer exchange below, where Alice sends an offer to Bob:  

                     Alice                               Bob 

                       | (1) Offer (SRTP and RTP)         | 
                       |--------------------------------->| 
                       |                                  | 
                       | (2) Answer (SRTP)                | 
                       |<---------------------------------| 
                       |                                  | 
                       | (3) Offer (SRTP)                 | 
                       |--------------------------------->| 
                       |                                  | 
                       | (4) Answer (SRTP)                | 
                       |<---------------------------------| 
                       |                                  | 
         

        Alice's offer includes RTP and SRTP as alternatives. RTP is the 
        default, but SRTP is the preferred one:

           a=pcfg:1 t=1 a=1 
            
        The "m=" line indicates that Alice is offering to use plain RTP with 
        PCMU or G.729.  The capabilities are provided by the "a=tcap" and 
        "a=acap" attributes.  The "tcap" capability indicates that both 
        Secure RTP and normal RTP are supported. The "acap" attribute 
        provides an attribute capability with a handle of 1. The capability 
        is a "crypto" attribute, which provides the keying material for SRTP 
        using SDP security descriptions [SDES]. The "a=pcfg" attribute 
        provides the potential configurations included in the offer by 
        reference to the capabilities.  A single potential configuration with 
        a configuration number of "1" is provided. It includes the transport 
        protocol capability 1 (RTP/SAVP, i.e. secure RTP) together with the 
        attribute capability 1, i.e. the crypto attribute provided.  Note 
        that attribute capability 1 is mandatory, and hence it must be 
        supported in order for the potential configuration to be used.  

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports SRTP and the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework, and hence he accepts the potential 
        configuration for Secure RTP provided by Alice:

           a=acfg:1 t=1 a=1 

        Bob includes the "a=acfg" attribute in the answer to inform Alice 
        that he based his answer on an offer containing the potential 
        configuration with transport protocol capability 1 and attribute 
        capability 1 from the offer SDP (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile using the 
        keying material provided).  Bob also includes his keying material in 
        a crypto attribute.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        When Alice receives Bob's answer, session negotiation has completed, 
        however Alice nevertheless chooses to generate a new offer using the 
        actual configuration. This is done purely to assist any 
        intermediaries that may reside between Alice and Bob but do not 
        support the SDP Capability Negotiation framework (and hence may not 
        understand the negotiation that just took place):  

        Alice's updated offer includes only SRTP, and it is not using the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework (Alice could have included the 
        capabilities as well is she wanted to):  

           v=0 
           o=- 25678 753850 IN IP4 192.0.2.1

              FEC_ORDER=FEC_SRTP 

        The "m=" line now indicates that Alice is offering to use secure RTP 
        with PCMU or G.729.  The "crypto" attribute, which provides the SRTP 
        keying material, is included with the same value again.  

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice, which he accepts, and then 
        generates an answer to Alice: 

           v=0 
           o=- 24351 621815 IN IP4 192.0.2.2 
           s=

                 inline:PS1uQCVeeCFCanVmcjkpPywjNWhcYD0mXXtxaVBR|2^20|1:4 

        Bob includes the same crypto attribute as before, and the session 
        proceeds without change. Although Bob did not include any 
        capabilities in his answer, he could have done so if he wanted to.  

        Note that in this particular example, the answerer supported the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework, and hence the attributes and 
        procedures defined here, however had he not, the answerer would 
        simply have ignored the new attributes received in step 1 and 
        accepted the offer to use normal RTP. In that case, the following 
        answer would have been generated in step 2 instead:

     4.2. Multiple Transport Protocols 

        The following example illustrates how to use the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation extensions to negotiate use of one out of several 
        possible transport protocols. As in the previous example, the offerer 
        uses the expected least-common-denominator (plain RTP) as the actual 
        configuration, and the alternative transport protocols as the 
        potential configurations.  

        The example is illustrated by the offer/answer exchange below, where 
        Alice sends an offer to Bob:  

                     Alice                               Bob 

                       | (1) Offer (RTP/[S]AVP[F])        |

                       | (3) Offer (RTP/AVPF)             | 
                       |--------------------------------->| 
                       |                                  | 
                       | (4) Answer (RTP/AVPF)            | 
                       |<---------------------------------| 
                       |                                  | 
         

        Alice's offer includes plain RTP (RTP/AVP), RTP with RTCP-based 
        feedback (RTP/AVPF), Secure RTP (RTP/SAVP), and Secure RTP with RTCP-
        based feedback (RTP/SAVPF) and SRTP as alternatives. RTP is the 
        default, with RTP/SAVPF, RTP/SAVP, and RTP/AVPF as the alternatives 
        and preferred in the order listed:

        The "m=" line indicates that Alice is offering to use plain RTP with 
        PCMU or G.729. The capabilities are provided by the "a=tcap" and 
        "a=acap" attributes.  The "tcap" capability indicates that Secure RTP 
        with RTCP-Based feedback (RTP/SAVPF), Secure RTP (RTP/SAVP), and RTP 
        with RTCP-Based feedback are supported. The first "acap" attribute 
        provides an attribute capability with a handle of 1. The capability 
        is a "crypto" attribute, which provides the keying material for SRTP 
        using SDP security descriptions [SDES]. The second "acap" attribute 
        provides an attribute capability with a handle of 2. The capability 
        is an "rtcp-fb" attribute, which is used by the RTCP-based feedback 
        profiles to indicate that payload type 0 (PCMU) supports feedback 
        type "nack". The "a=pcfg" attributes provide the potential 
        configurations included in the offer by reference to the 
        capabilities. There are three potential configurations: 

        o  Potential configuration 1, which is the most preferred potential 
           configuration specifies use of transport protocol capability 1 
           (RTP/SAVPF) and attribute capabilities 1 (the "crypto" attribute) 
           and 2 (the "rtcp-fb" attribute). Support for the first one is 
           mandatory whereas support for the second one is optional.  

        o  Potential configuration 2, which is the second most preferred 
           potential configuration specifies use of transport protocol 
           capability 2 (RTP/SAVP) and mandatory attribute capability 1 (the 
           "crypto" attribute).  

        o  Potential configuration 3, which is the least preferred potential 
           configuration (but the second least preferred configuration 
           overall, since the actual configuration provided by the "m=" line 
           is always the least preferred configuration), specifies use of 
           transport protocol capability 3 (RTP/AVPF) and optional attribute 
           capability 2 (the "rtcp-fb" attribute).  

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob does not support any 
        secure RTP profiles, however he supports plain RTP and RTP with RTCP-
        based feedback, as well as the SDP Capability Negotiation extensions, 
        and hence he accepts the potential configuration for RTP with RTCP-
        based feedback provided by Alice:

        The "m=" line now indicates that Alice is offering to use RTP with 
        RTCP-based feedback and using PCMU or G.729.  The "rtcp-fb" attribute 
        provides the feedback type "nack" for payload type 0 again (but as 
        part of the actual configuration).  

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice, which he accepts, and then

        Bob includes the same "rtcp-fb" attribute as before, and the session 
        proceeds without change. Although Bob did not include any 
        capabilities in his answer, he could have done so if he wanted to.  

        Note that in this particular example, the answerer supported the SDP 
        Capability Negotiation framework and hence the attributes and 
        procedures defined here, however had he not, the answerer would 
        simply have ignored the new attributes received in step 1 and 
        accepted the offer to use normal RTP. In that case, the following 
        answer would have been generated in step 2 instead:

     4.3. Best-Effort SRTP with Session-Level MIKEY and Media Level Security 
        Descriptions 

        The following example illustrates how to use the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation extensions to support so-called Best-Effort Secure RTP as 
        well as alternative keying mechanisms, more specifically MIKEY and 
        SDP Security Descriptions. The offerer (Alice) wants to establish an 
        audio and video session. Alice prefers to use session-level MIKEY as 
        the key management protocol, but supports SDP security descriptions 
        as well.  

        The example is illustrated by the offer/answer exchange below, where 
        Alice sends an offer to Bob:

        Alice's offer includes an audio and a video stream. The audio stream 
        offers use of plain RTP and secure RTP as alternatives, whereas the 
        video stream offers use of plain RTP, RTP with RTCP-based feedback, 
        Secure RTP, and Secure RTP with RTCP-based feedback as alternatives:

        The potential configuration for the audio stream specifies use of

        (session-level MIKEY as the keying mechanism) or 2 (SDP Security 
        Descriptions as the keying mechanism). Support for either of these

        attribute capabilities is mandatory. There are three potential 
        configurations for the video stream.  

        o  The first configuration with configuration number 1 uses transport 
           capability 1 (RTP/SAVPF) with either attribute capabilities 1 and 
           4 (session-level MIKEY and the "rtcp-fb" attribute) or attribute 
           capabilities 3 and 4 (SDP security descriptions and the "rtcp-fb" 
           attribute). In this example, the offerer insists on not only the 
           keying mechanism being supported, but also that the "rtcp-fb" 
           attribute is supported with the value indicated. Consequently, all 
           the attribute capabilities are marked as mandatory in this 
           potential configuration.  

        o  The second configuration with configuration number 2 uses 
           transport capability 2 (RTP/SAVP) and either attribute capability 
           1 (session-level MIKEY) or attribute capability 3 (SDP security 
           descriptions). Both attribute capabilities are mandatory in this 
           configuration. 

        o  The third configuration with configuration number 3 uses transport 
           capability 3 (RTP/AVPF) and mandatory attribute capability 4 (the 
           "rtcp-fb" attribute).  

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports Secure RTP, 
        Secure RTP with RTCP-based feedback and the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation extensions. Bob also supports SDP Security Descriptions, 
        but not MIKEY, and hence he generates the following answer:

        attribute identifying actual configuration 1 for the audio media 
        stream from the offer, using transport capability 2 (RTP/SAVP) and 
        attribute capability 2 (the crypto attribute from the offer). For the 
        video stream, Bob accepted the use of secure RTP with RTCP-based 
        feedback, and hence the profile in the "m=" line is "RTP/SAVPF". Bob 
        also includes a "crypto" attribute with his own keying material, and 
        an "acfg" attribute identifying actual configuration 1 for the video 
        stream from the offer, using transport capability 1 (RTP/SAVPF) and 
        attribute capabilities 3 (the crypto attribute from the offer) and 4 
        (the "rtcp-fb" attribute from the offer).  

        When Alice receives Bob's answer, session negotiation has completed, 
        however Alice nevertheless chooses to generate a new offer using the 
        actual configuration. This is done purely to assist any 
        intermediaries that may reside between Alice and Bob but do not 
        support the capability negotiation extensions (and hence may not 
        understand the negotiation that just took place):  

        Alice's updated offer includes only SRTP for the audio stream SRTP 
        with RTCP-based feedback for the video stream, and it is not using 
        the SDP Capability Negotiation framework (Alice could have included 
        the capabilities as well is she wanted to):

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice, which he accepts, and then 
        generates an answer to Alice:

           o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 192.0.2.2

           a=rtcp-fb:* nack 

        Bob includes the same crypto attribute as before, and the session 
        proceeds without change. Although Bob did not include any 
        capabilities in his answer, he could have done so if he wanted to.  

        Note that in this particular example, the answerer supported the 
        capability extensions defined here, however had he not, the answerer 
        would simply have ignored the new attributes received in step 1 and 
        accepted the offer to use normal RTP. In that case, the following 
        answer would have been generated in step 2 instead: 

           v=0 
           o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 192.0.2.2 
           s=

           a=rtcp-fb:* nack 
         

        Finally, if Bob had chosen to use session-level MIKEY instead of SDP 
        security descriptions instead, the following answer would have been 
        generated:

        It should be noted, that although Bob could have chosen session-level 
        MIKEY for one media stream, and SDP Security Descriptions for another 
        media stream, there are no well-defined offerer processing rules of 
        the resulting answer for this, and hence the offerer may incorrectly 
        assume use of MIKEY for both streams. To avoid this, if the answerer 
        chooses session-level MIKEY, then all secure RTP based media streams 
        SHOULD use MIKEY (this applies irrespective of whether SDP Capability 
        Negotiation is being used or not). Use of media-level MIKEY does not 
        have a similar constraint.  

     4.4. SRTP with Session-Level MIKEY and Media Level Security Descriptions 
        as Alternatives 

        The following example illustrates how to use the SDP Capability 
        Negotiation framework to negotiate use of either MIKEY or SDP 
        Security Descriptions, when one of them is included as part of the 
        actual configuration, and the other one is being selected. The 
        offerer (Alice) wants to establish an audio and video session. Alice 
        prefers to use session-level MIKEY as the key management protocol, 
        but supports SDP security descriptions as well.  

        The example is illustrated by the offer/answer exchange below, where 
        Alice sends an offer to Bob:  

                  Alice                                     Bob 

                    | (1) Offer (RTP/[S]AVP[F], SDES|MIKEY)  | 
                    |--------------------------------------->| 
                    |                                        | 
                    | (2) Answer (RTP/SAVP, SDES)            | 
                    |<---------------------------------------| 
                    |                                        | 
         

        Alice's offer includes an audio and a video stream. Both the audio 
        and the video stream offer use of secure RTP:

        Alice does not know whether Bob supports MIKEY or SDP Security 
        Descriptions. She could include attributes for both, however the 
        resulting procedures and potential interactions are not well-defined. 
        Instead, she places a session-level key-mgmt attribute for MIKEY in 
        the actual configuration with SDP security descriptions as an 
        alternative in the potential configuration. The potential 
        configuration for the audio stream specifies that all session level 
        attributes are to be deleted (i.e. the session-level "a=key-mgmt" 
        attribute) and that mandatory attribute capability 2 is to be used 
        (i.e. the crypto attribute). The potential configuration for the 
        video stream is similar, except it uses it's own mandatory crypto 
        attribute capability (2). Note how deletion of the session-level 
        attributes does not affect the media-level attributes.  

        Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports Secure RTP and 
        the SDP Capability Negotiation framework. Bob also supports both SDP 
        Security Descriptions and MIKEY. Since the potential configuration is 
        more preferred than the actual configuration, Bob (conceptually) 
        generates an internal potential configuration SDP that contains the 
        crypto attributes for the audio and video stream, but not the key-
        mgmt attribute for MIKEY, thereby avoiding any ambiguity between the 
        two keying mechanisms. As a result, he generates the following 
        answer:

        For the audio stream, Bob accepted the use of secure RTP using SDP 
        security descriptions. Bob therefore includes a "crypto" attribute 
        with his own keying material, and an "acfg" attribute identifying 
        actual configuration 1 for the audio media stream from the offer, 
        with the delete-attributes ("-s") and attribute capability 1 (the 
        crypto attribute from the offer). For the video stream, Bob also 
        accepted the use of secure RTP using SDP security descriptions. Bob 
        therefore includes a "crypto" attribute with his own keying material, 
        and an "acfg" attribute identifying actual configuration 1 for the 
        video stream from the offer, with the delete-attributes ("-s") and 
        attribute capability 2.   

        Below, we illustrate the offer SDP, when Bob instead offers the 
        "crypto" attribute as the actual configuration keying mechanism and 
        "key-mgmt" as the potential configuration:

        Note how we this time need to perform delete-attributes at the media-
        level instead of the session-level. When doing that, all attributes

        from the actual configuration SDP, including the rtpmaps provided, 
        are removed. Consequently, we had to include these rtpmaps as 
        capabilities as well, and then include them in the potential 
        configuration, thereby effectively recreating the original rtpmap 
        attributes in the resulting potential configuration SDP.  

     5. Security Considerations 

        The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework is defined to be used within 
        the context of the offer/answer model, and hence all the offer/answer 
        security considerations apply here as well. Similarly, the Session 
        Initiation Protocol (SIP) uses SDP and the offer/answer model, and 
        hence, when used in that context, the SIP security considerations 
        apply as well.  

        However, SDP Capability Negotiation introduces additional security 
        issues. Its use as a mechanism to enable alternative transport 
        protocol negotiation (secure and non-secure) as well as its ability 
        to negotiate use of more or less secure keying methods and material 
        warrant further security considerations. Also, the (continued) 
        support for receiving media before answer combined with negotiation 
        of alternative transport protocols (secure and non-secure) warrant 
        further security considerations. We discuss these issues below.  

        The SDP Capability Negotiation framework allows for an offered media 
        stream to both indicate and support various levels of security for 
        that media stream. Different levels of security can for example be 
        negotiated by use of alternative attribute capabilities each 
        indicating more or less secure keying methods as well as more or less 
        strong ciphers. Since the offerer indicates support for each of these 
        alternatives, he will presumably accept the answerer seemingly 
        selecting any of the offered alternatives. If an attacker can modify 
        the SDP offer, he can thereby force the negotiation of the weakest 
        security mechanism that the offerer is willing to accept. This may in 
        turn enable the attacker to compromise the security of the negotiated 
        media stream. Similarly, if the offerer wishes to negotiate use of a 
        secure media stream (e.g. secure RTP), but includes a non-secure 
        media stream (e.g. plain RTP) as a valid (but less preferred) 
        alternative, then an attacker that can modify the offered SDP will be 
        able to force the establishment of an insecure media stream. The 
        solution to both of these problems involves the use of integrity 
        protection over the SDP. Ideally, this integrity protection provides 
        end-to-end integrity protection in order to protect from any man-in-
        the-middle attack; secure multiparts such as S/MIME [SMIME] provide 
        one such solution, however S/MIME requires use and availability of a 
        Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). A slightly less secure alternative 
        when using SIP, but generally much easier to deploy in practice

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        (since it does not require a PKI), is to use SIP Identity [RFC4474]; 
        this requires the existence of an authentication service (see 
        [RFC4474]). Yet another, and considerably less secure, alternative is 
        to use hop-by-hop security only, e.g. TLS or IPSec thereby ensuring 
        the integrity of the offered SDP on a hop-by-hop basis. Note however 
        that SIP proxies or other intermediaries processing the SIP request 
        at each hop are able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by 
        modifying the offered SDP.  

        Per the normal offer/answer procedures, as soon as the offerer has 
        generated an offer, the offerer must be prepared to receive media in 
        accordance with that offer. The SDP Capability Negotiation preserves 
        that behavior for the actual configuration in the offer, however the 
        offerer has no way of knowing which configuration (actual or 
        potential) configuration was actually selected by the offerer, until 
        an answer indication is received. This opens up a new security issue 
        where an attacker may be able to interject media towards the offerer 
        until the answer is received. For example, the offerer may use plain 
        RTP as the actual configuration and secure RTP as an alternative 
        potential configuration. Even though the answerer selects secure RTP, 
        the offerer will not know that until he receives the answer, and 
        hence an attacker will be able to send media to the offerer 
        meanwhile. The easiest protection against such an attack is to not 
        offer use of the non-secure media stream in the actual configuration, 
        however that may in itself have undesirable side-effects: If the 
        answerer does not support the secure media stream and also does not 
        support the capability negotiation framework, then negotiation of the 
        media stream will fail. Alternatively, SDP security preconditions 
        [sprecon] can be used. This will ensure that media is not flowing 
        until session negotiation has completed and hence the selected 
        configuration is known. Use of preconditions however requires both 
        side to support them. If they don't, and use of them is required, the 
        session will fail. As a (limited) work around to this, it is 
        RECOMMENDED that SIP entities generate an answer SDP and send it to 
        the offerer as soon as possible, for example in a 183 Session 
        Progress message. This will limit the time during which an attacker 
        can send media to the offerer. Section 3.10. presents other 
        alternatives as well.  

        Additional security considerations apply to the answer SDP as well. 
        The actual configuration attribute tells the offerer which potential 
        configuration the answer was actually based on, and hence an attacker 
        that can either modify or remove the actual configuration attribute 
        in the answer can cause session failure as well as extend the time 
        window during which the offerer will accept incoming media that does 
        not conform to the actual answer. The solutions to this SDP answer 
        integrity problem are the same as for the offer, i.e. use of end-to-

        end integrity protection, SIP identity, or hop-by-hop protection. The 
        mechanism to use depends on the mechanisms supported by the offerer 
        as well as the acceptable security trade-offs.  

        As described in Section 3.1. , SDP Capability Negotiation 
        conceptually allows an offerer to include many different offers in a 
        single SDP. This can in turn cause the answerer to process a large 
        number of alternative potential offers, which can consume significant 
        memory and CPU resources. An attacker can use this amplification 
        feature to launch a denial of service attack against the answerer. 
        The answerer MUST protect itself from such attacks. As explained in 
        Section 3.11. , the answerer can help reduce the effects of such an 
        attack by first discarding all potential configurations that contain 
        unsupported transport protocols and/or unsupported or invalid 
        mandatory attribute capabilities. The answerer SHOULD also look out 
        for potential configurations that are designed to pass the above 
        test, but nevertheless produce a large number of potential 
        configuration SDPs that cannot be supported. 

          A possible way of achieving that is for an attacker to find a  
          valid session-level attribute that causes conflicts or otherwise 
          interferes with individual media description configurations. 
          Currently, we do not know of such an SDP attribute, however this 
          does not mean it doesn't exist, or that it will not exist in the 
          future. If such attributes are found to exist, implementers should 
          explicitly protect against them.  

        A significant number of valid and supported potential configurations 
        may remain. However, since all of those contain only valid and 
        supported transport protocols and attributes, it is expected that 
        only a few of them will need to be processed on average. Still, the 
        answerer MUST ensure that it does not needlessly consume large 
        amounts of memory and CPU resources when processing those as well as 
        be prepared to handle the case where a large number of potential 
        configurations still need to be processed.

     8. Change Log 

     8.1. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-06 

        o  Added additional background text on terminology used, and a new 
           section on the negotiation model.  

        o  Allowed for session-level attribute capabilities to contain media-
           level only attributes, albeit the base framework does not define 
           (or allow) them to be used in a potential configuration 
           (extensions may change that) 

        o  Disallowing multiple "a=tcap" attributes at the session-level 
           and/or on a per media description basis; at most one at the 
           session-level and per media description now. 

        o  Changed the "a=pcfg" attribute to make a potential configuration 
           list optional in order to allow for the actual configuration to be 
           referenced.  

        o  Removed the ability to delete and replace individual attributes 
           from the actual configuration SDP.  

        o  Introduced the notion of mandatory and optional attribute 
           capabilities in a potential configuration and updated the "a=pcfg" 
           attribute and associated procedures accordingly.  

        o  Specified that mandatory attribute capabilities and the transport 
           protocol (if any) from a potential configuration need to be 
           supported in order to select that potential configuration. 
           Offer/answer procedures updated accordingly as well.  

        o  Noted potential interaction and synchronization issues with use of 
           session-level attributes and attribute capabilities and added 
           recommendation to avoid use of session-level attributes when 
           possible. 

        o  Fixed error in "a=acfg" grammar (missing config-number) and 
           updated attribute definition in accordance with the "a=pcfg" 
           attribute changes.  

        o  Updated text associated with processing media before answer to 
           allow for playing out garbage or discard until answer received. 
           Additional detail on alternative solutions provided as well.

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        o  Added recommendation to send back answer SDP as soon as possible, 
           when a potential configuration different from the actual 
           configuration has been chosen.  

        o  Added new section on interactions with SIP option tags. 

        o  Added new section on dealing with large number of potential 
           configurations. 

        o  Added new section on SDP capability negotiation and 
           intermediaries.  

        o  Updated examples in accordance with other changes and to 
           illustrate use of mandatory and optional attribute capabilities in 
           a potential configuration.  

        o  Updated security considerations to address potential denial of 
           service attack caused by large number of potential configurations.  

        o  Various editorial updates throughout. 

     8.2. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-05 

        o  Allowed for '<type>=<value>' attributes to be listed as attribute 
           capabilities the attribute name only. 

        o  Changed IP-address to conform to RFC 3330 guidelines. 

        o  Added section on relationship to RFC 3407 and "Obsoletes: 3407" in 
           the front.  

        o  Disallowed use of white space in a number of places for more 
           consistency with existing SDP practice 

        o  Changed "csup" and "creq" attributes to not allow multiple 
           instances at the session-level and multiple instances per media 
           description (only one for each now) 

        o  Changed to not require use of "creq" with base option tag ("cap-
           v0").  

        o  Relaxed restrictions on extension capabilities

     Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation              July 2007 
         

        o  Updated potential configuration attribute syntax and semantics. In 
           particular, potential configuration attributes can now replace and 
           delete various existing attributes in original SDP to better 
           control potential attribute interactions with the actual 
           configuration while preserving message size efficiency.  

        o  Updated actual configuration attribute to align with the updates 
           to the potential configuration attributes.  

        o  Updated offer/answer procedures to align with other changes.  

        o  Changed recommendation for second offer/answer exchange to "MAY" 
           strength, unless for the cases where it is known or suspected that 
           it is needed.  

        o  Updated ICE interactions to explain how the new attribute 
           delete/replace features can solve certain potential interactions. 

        o  Updated rtpmap and fmtp section to allow potential configurations 
           to use remapped payload types in attribute capabilities for 
           rtpmaps and fmtp parameters.  

        o  Added section on direction attributes.  

        o  Added another example showing SRTP with session-level MIKEY and 
           SDP Security Descriptions using the attribute capability DELETE 
           operator.  

     8.3. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-04 

        The following are the major changes compared to version -03: 

        o  Added explicit ordering rules for attributes added by potential 
           configurations. 

        o  Noted that ICE interaction issues (ice-tcp specifically) may not 
           be as clear as originally thought. 

        o  Added considerations on using rtpmap and fmtp attributes as 
           attribute capabilities. 

        o  Added multiple transport protocol example. 

        o  Added session-level MIKEY and media level security descriptions 
           example.

        The following are the major changes compared to version -02: 

        o  Base option tag name changed from "v0" to "cap-v0". 

        o  Added new section on extension capability attributes 

        o  Firmed up offer/answer procedures. 

        o  Added security considerations 

        o  Added IANA considerations 

     8.5. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-02 

        The following are the major changes compared to version -01: 

        o  Potential configurations are no longer allowed at the session 
           level 

        o  Renamed capability attributes ("capar" to "acap" and "ctrpr" to 
           "tcap") 

        o  Changed name and semantics of the initial number (now called 
           configuration number) in potential configuration attributes; must 
           now be unique and can be used as a handle 

        o  Actual configuration attribute now includes configuration number 
           from the selected potential configuration attribute 

        o  Added ABNF throughout 

        o  Specified that answerer should include "a=csup" in case of 
           unsupported required extensions in offer. 

        o  Specified use of second offer/answer exchange when answerer 
           selected a potential configuration 

        o  Updated rules (and added restrictions) for referencing media- and 
           session-level capabilities in potential configurations (at the 
           media level) 

        o  Added initial section on ICE interactions 

        o  Added initial section on receiving media before answer

     8.6. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-01 

        The following are the major changes compared to version -00: 

        o  Media capabilities are no longer considered a core capability and 
           hence have been removed. This leaves transport protocols and 
           attributes as the only capabilities defined by the core. 

        o  Version attribute has been removed and an option tag to indicate 
           the actual version has been defined instead. 

        o  Clarified rules for session-level and media level attributes 
           provided at either level as well how they can be used in potential 
           configurations.  

        o  Potential configuration parameters no longer have implicit 
           ordering; an explicit preference indicator is now included. 

        o  The parameter name for transport protocols in the potential and 
           actual configuration attributes have been changed "p" to "t".  

        o  Clarified operator precedence within potential and actual 
           configuration attributes.  

        o  Potential configurations at the session level now limited to 
           indicate latent capability configurations. Consequently, an actual 
           configuration attribute can no longer be provided at the session 
           level.  

        o  Cleaned up capability and potential configuration terminology - 
           they are now two clearly different things.  

     8.7. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-00 

        Version 00 is the initial version. The solution provided in this 
        initial version is based on an earlier (individual submission) 
        version of [SDPCapNeg]. The following are the major changes compared 
        to that document: 

        o  Solution no longer based on RFC 3407, but defines a set of similar 
           attributes (with some differences). 

        o  Various minor changes to the previously defined attributes. 

        o  Multiple transport capabilities can be included in a single "tcap" 
           attribute

        o  A version attribute is now included. 

        o  Extensions to the framework are formally supported. 

        o  Option tags and the ability to list supported and required 
           extensions are supported.  

        o  A best-effort SRTP example use case has been added.  

        o  Some terminology change throughout to more clearly indicate what 
           constitutes capabilities and what constitutes configurations.
