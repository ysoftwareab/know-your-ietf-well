                     draft-mosko-icnrg-selectors-00

Abstract

   CCNx selector based discovery uses exclusions and interest name
   suffix matching to discover content in the network.  Participating
   nodes may respond with matching Content Objects from cache using an
   encapsulation protocol.  This document specifies the available
   selectors, their encoding in a name path segment, and the
   encapsulation protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Content Discovery is an important feature of CCNx.  This document
   specifies a discovery mechanism that uses a name path segment to
   encode a discovery query in an Interest.  Participating nodes may
   reply with a Content Object if it matches the encoded query.  The
   query uses exclusions to work around incorrect responses.

   This document specifies a new name TLV type, T_SELECTOR, for selector
   query.  It also specifies a new Content Object PayloadType that
   encapsulates another Content Object.  The inner Content Object is
   used to return a Content Object with a longer name than in an
   interest.  The inner object's signature should verify.

   Not all nodes along the Interest path need to participate in the
   discovery process.  A non-participating node should forward the
   Interest and encapsulating Content Object as normal per
   [CCNSemantics].  A participating node should verify that the inner
   Content Object matches the selector query in the PIT entry.

   Note that Selector discovery is not needed when asking for a Content
   Object by its ContentObjectHash, as there should only ever be one
   match for that.

   Selector discovery in CCNx 1.0 differs in three ways from the current
   NDN and prior CCNx 0.x selector discovery.  First, CCNx 1.0 uses a
   distinguished field for the ContentObjectHashRestriction.  It is not
   appended to the name to form the so-called "full name."  This means
   that there is no implicit digest name segment.  Thus, using a
   MinSuffixComponents and MaxSuffixComponents of 0 will match the exact
   name in the Interest without needing to add one extra component to
   account for the implicit digest.  Second, there is a HashExcludes
   field that lists ContentObjectHashRestrictions to exclude instead of
   appending them as an implicit name component.  Third, the encoding of
   Excludes differs from prior encodings and uses a simpler formulation
   with the same expressiveness that also takes in to consideration that
   name segments in CCNx 1.0 have TLV types associated with them.

   CCNx 1.0 allows Content Objects to have no name and be retrieved by
   hash only.  As they have no name, they are not discoverable via name-
   based selector discovery.

   Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.
   Because of the TLV encoding and optional fields or sizes, there is no
   concise way to represent all possibilities.  We use the convention
   that ASCII art fields enclosed by vertical bars "|" represent exact
   bit widths.  Fields with a forward slash "/" are variable bitwidths,
   which we typically pad out to word alignment for picture readability.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

   Selector based discovery uses six query variables to discover
   content.  These selectors are encoded as a single name path segment
   affixed to an Interest name.  The selectors operate on the prefix up
   to, but not including the selector name path segment.  The selector
   name path segment should be the last path segment.

   The selectors are:

   o  MinSuffixComponents: the minimum number of additional name path
      segments a matching Content Object must have in its name.  The
      default value is 0.

   o  MaxSuffixComponents: The maximum number of additional name path
      segments a matching Content Object may have in its name.  The
      default value is unlimited.

   o  ChildSelector: Answer with the left-most or right-most child.

   o  NameExcludes: A set of range and singleton exclusions to eliminate
      Content Objects.  The exclusions match against the name path
      segment that would immediately follow the Interest name prefix up
      to but not including the Selector path segment.

   o  InnerKeyId: Matches the KeyId of the encapsulated object.

   o  HashExcludes: A list of ContentObjectHashRestrictions to exclude.

   A node using Selector discovery appends a Selector name path segment
   to the end of the Interest name.  Even if no selectors are used, the
   Selector path segment is added to the end, which indicates to a
   participating node that it should apply Selector based matching to
   the Interest.  In this case, the default values -- if any -- of each
   selector are used.

   A node receiving a Selector Interest should match against the Content
   Store using the selector rules.  Based on the sort order, it should
   pick the appropriate Content Object, if any, and return it in an
   Encapsulation Object.  If no Content Objects match, the Interest
   should be forwarded or NACKed as normal.

   An Encapsulation Object is a Content Object that matches the Selector
   Interest and whose payload is the discovered Content Object.  The
   ContentType of an Encapsulation Object is "ENCAP".  The outer name
   matches the Selector Interest name.  The inner Content Object name
   matches the Selector discovery.

   The KeyIdRestriction of the Interest matches the outer KeyId of the
   outer Content Object, as normal.  This allows a responding cache or
   producer to sign (or MAC or MIC) the response.  The InnerKeyId of the
   Selector matches the inner ContentObject in the same way.  This
   allows the selector to discriminate discovery including the inner
   KeyId.

   The HashExcludes eliminate any Content Objects whose
   ContentObjectHash matches any of the listed values.  It should not
   matter if matching objects are discarded before name prefix selector
   matching or after.  A Content Object must always pass both the
   HashExcludes filter and the name prefix selector filters, wether it
   is done first or last does not matter.  HashExcludes are encoded the
   same way as a ContentObjectHashRestriction value in an Interest.
   Note that this Selector does not exist in NDN or CCNx 0.x.  We use an
   explicit set of HashExcludes rather than constructing a full name
   with the implicit digest component at the end.

   If an authoritative producer receives a Selector discovery, it SHOULD
   generate the inner Content Object as normal and encapsulate it as
   normal.  It MAY also respond with an Interest Return or not respond
   at all.  At the present, responding directly to the Selector Interest
   with data without encapsulating it is not supported.  Note that an
   application is NOT REQUIRED to implement Selector discovery; if the
   application wishes to make use of this mechanism, then it must
   implement it, if it does not use this mechanism then it does not need
   to implement it.

   Normally, the outer Content Object does not have a Validation
   section.  A responding node MAY include a CRC32C or other integrity
   check.  Signing or MACing an outer Content Object is possible, but
   should only be used in environments where that degree of trust is
   necessary.  Signing the outer Content Object in no way replaces the
   signature (if any) of the inner Content Object.  The outer signature
   only identifies the responding cache (or producer).

3.  Name Labels and TLV types

   The Selector name segment type T_SELECTOR has type %x0010.

   The PayloadType of T_PAYLOADTYPE_ENCAP has the value 8.

3.1.  Child Selector

   If there are multiple choices to answer an Interest, the Child
   Selector specifies the desired ordering of responses.  %x00 =
   leftmost, %x01 = rightmost.

3.2.  Interest Min(Max)SuffixComponents

   The Min and Max suffix components are encoded as a minimum-length
   unsigned integer in network byte order number inside the value.  A
   "0" is represented as a single byte %0x00.  A length 0 value is
   interpreted the same as the type not being present.

                        1                   2                   3

   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   type = T_MINSUFFIX or T_MAXSUFFIX

3.3.  Name Excludes

   Interest Excludes specify a set of singletons and ranges to exclude
   when matching Content Object names to an Interest.  They match the
   name component immediately following the last component of the
   Interest name (not including the Selector TLV).  The excludes must be
   sorted in ascending order, using the normal Name sorting rules.

   A name exclusion is the full TLV expression of a name component, not
   just it's value.

   An exclusion value A is less than B iff the TLV type of A is less
   than the TLV type of B, or being equal, the TLV value of A is
   shortlex less than the TLV value of B.  A shortlex comparison means
   that X is less than Y is X is shorter than Y or the lengths being
   equal, X lexicagraphically sorts before Y.

   A zero-length exclusion is the minimum exclusion and must appear
   before any other exclusion.  Note that a zero-length exlcusion has no

   TLV type for the name component, so it will match any name segment
   TLV type.  It is equivalent to minus infinity.

   The zero-length name component is the minimum name component of that
   name component type (e.g.T_NAMESEGMENT).

   An exclude may contain either an Exclude Range type or an Exclude
   Singleton type.  An Exclude Range type means the given value starts a
   half-open exclusion range that begins inclusive of the Range value
   and ends open at the next Singleton or at infinity if it is the last
   exclude component.  An Exclude Singleton means to exclude the exact
   value given.

   Note that this syntax does not require the "ANY" exclude component
   that is part of the NDN and CCNx 0.x syntax.

                         1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   / Zero or more exclude-components                               /
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   exclude-components = *component [start-range-tlv]
   component = (start-range-tlv singleton-tlv) / singleton-tlv

   The ABNF of the exclude-component allows for zero or more components
   followed by an option start-range-tlv.  A component is either a half-
   open range (start-range-tlv singleton-tlv) or a singleton-tlv.

   The optional final start-range-tlv has no terminating singleton-tlv.
   This means it extends out to plus infinity.

   Note that to exclude from negative infinity to some value "foo", we
   do not need to include an ANY element because the zero-length name
   component is, by definition, the minimum element and we use inclusive
   range start.  Therefore, begining an exlcusion with the zero-length
   range effectively excludes from minus infinity.

3.3.1.  Exclude Singleton

   A singleton exclude component means to exclude a name path segment
   exactly matching the given value.

3.3.2.  Exclude Range

   A Range exclude means to exclude the from the given value up to but
   not including the next Singleton.  If the Range is the last component
   in the Exclude, it means to exclude to infinity.

3.3.3.  Examples

   In these examples, we will use the notation S[foo] to represent a
   singleton exclusion "foo" and R[foo] to represent a range exclusion
   beginning at "foo."  In the column Range, we use standard open
   (parenthesis) and closed (square bracket) interval notation.  We
   assume all TLV name types of T_NAMESEGMENT if there is no explicit
   name segment type given.  In our notation, something like S[VER=bar]
   would exclude a TLV type Version and value "bar".

4.  Content Store and Caching

   The encapsulated responses to discovery are cachable, like all
   Content Objects.  A participating forwarder MAY cache the inner
   Content Object separately from the outer Content Object assuming it
   passes the selector tests.  A non-participating forwarder MAY only
   cache the outer Content Object (encapsulating the inner).

   A participating content store MUST obey both the outer and inner
   cache control directives: ExpiryTime and RecommendedCacheTime.  Thus,
   a responding cache can reduce or prevent the response being cached by
   setting a short or zero ExpiryTime independently of the caching
   behavior of the encapsulated inner Content Object.

   A non-participating content store MUST objey the outer cache control
   directives, as normal.  The inner content object is opaque data to
   it.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a participating node creating the encapsulated
   response set a short RecommendedCacheTime and MAY set an ExpirtyTime.

   Note that cached respones are, in general, not a problem for the
   discovery process.  Participating nodes will always do a full
   selector match, so a consumer can work around incorrect responses as
   normal.  Because Selector interests with differnent Exclude blocks
   will result in different names, prior responses will not match in the
   caches of non-participating nodes, esepcially if the
   RecommendedCacheTime (or ExpireTime) is set to 0.

5.  Annex A: Examples

   TODO: Provide complete examples of Interests and responses.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.  TODO: If this document is
   submitted as an official draft, this section must be updated to
   reflect the IANA registries described in [CCNMessages]

7.  Security Considerations

   Because respones use encapsulation, there is size expansion in the
   response from the original Content Object.  The expansion will be the
   length of the encapsulating Selector name plus the size of any
   validation uses on the outer Content Object (e.g. a CRC32C), plus
   framing overhead.  This means that one cannot respond with a Content
   Object that is too close to the maximum packet size.

   Participating nodes should be able to filter incorrect responses just
   as they do in NDN or CCNx 0.x.  If all node participate, then one has
   equivalent in-network filtering behavior as those other protocols.

   If the outer Content Object is signed, the consumer should, as
   normal, verify the signature for accuracy.  However, the trust of the
   outer signature is normally not important and usually reflects
   operation in a specific environment.  An outer Validation section is
   usually used only for integrity checks.
