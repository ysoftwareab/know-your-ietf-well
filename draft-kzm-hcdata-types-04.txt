2.  Abstract

This memo specifies new textual conventions for additional high capacity
data types, intended for SNMP implementations which already support the
Counter64 data type. The definitions contained in this document
represent a short term solution which may be deprecated in the future.

4.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards

        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 cannot be produced through any
   translation, since textual conventions are not supported in SMIv1.

5.  Overview

The Structure of Management Information [RFC2578] does not explicitly
address the question of how to represent integer objects other than
counters that would require up to 64 bits to provide the necessary range
and precision.  There are MIBs in progress targeted for the standards
track, such as the RMON MIB for High Capacity Networks [HC-RMON], which
need such data types. This memo specifies a short term solution, using
textual conventions, to meet these needs.

5.1.  Short Term and Long Term Objectives

There is an immediate need to provide a Gauge64 data type, similar in
semantics to the Gauge32 data type, in order to support common data
representations such as:

  -  a snapshot of a Counter64 at a given moment, e.g., history ring
     buffer

Internet-Draft          High Capacity Data Types           February 2000


  -  the difference between 2 Counter64 values

There is also an immediate need for a temporary zero-based counter type
for 64-bit, similar in semantics to the ZeroBasedCounter32 TC defined in
the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].

Both of these textual conventions should use a base type of Gauge64 or
Unsigned64, but such a base type is not available.  Until such a base
type is defined and deployed, these temporary textual conventions (which
use a base type of Counter64) will be used in MIBs such as the High
Capacity RMON MIB [HC-RMON].

In order to be backward compatible with existing implementations of
Counter64, the ASN.1 encoding of unsigned 64-bit data types must be
identical to the encoding of Counter64 objects, i.e., identified by the
[APPLICATION 6] ASN.1 tag.

Note that the textual conventions defined in this document represent a
limited and short-term solution to the problem.  These textual
conventions may be deprecated as a long term solution is defined and
deployed to replace them.  A MIB object which uses either of these
textual conventions may also have to be deprecated, in which case, a
'duplicate' object of the appropriate type may need to be defined to
replace it.

5.2.  Limitations of the Textual Convention Approach

New unsigned data types with textual conventions based on the Counter64
tag, instead of a new (or other existing) ASN.1 tag has some
limitations:

  -  The MAX-ACCESS of the TC must be read-only, because the MAX-ACCESS
     of the underlying Counter64 type is read-only.

  -  No sub-range can be specified on the TC-derived types, because sub-
     ranges are not allowed on Counter64 objects.

  -  No DEFVAL clause can be specified for the TC-derived types, because
     DEFVALs are not allowed on Counter64 objects.

  -  The TC-derived types cannot be used in an INDEX clause, because
     there is no INDEX clause mapping defined for objects of type
     Counter64.

6.  New Textual Conventions

The following textual conventions are defined to support unsigned 64-bit
data types for HC-RMON [HC-RMON].

6.1.  CounterBasedGauge64

This textual convention defines a 64-bit gauge, but defined with
Counter64 syntax, since no Gauge64 or Unsigned64 base type is available
in SMIv2.

This TC is used for storing the difference between 2 Counter64 values,
or simply storing a snapshot of a Counter64 value at a given moment in
time.

6.2.  ZeroBasedCounter64

This textual convention defines a 64-bit counter with an initial value
of zero, instead of an arbitrary initial value.

This TC is used for counter objects in tables which are instantiated by
management application action.

            "The CounterBasedGauge64 type represents a non-negative

            not be smaller than 0.  The value of a CounterBasedGauge64
            has its maximum value whenever the information being modeled
            is greater than or equal to its maximum value, and has its
            minimum value whenever the information being modeled is
            smaller than or equal to its minimum value.  If the
            information being modeled subsequently decreases below

            (increases above) the maximum (minimum) value, the
            CounterBasedGauge64 also decreases (increases).

            Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
            because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap' semantics
            associated with the Counter64 base type are not preserved.
            It is possible that management applications which rely
            solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to determine object
            semantics will mistakenly operate upon objects of this type
            as they would for Counter64 objects.

            This textual convention represents a limited and short-term
            solution, and may be deprecated as a long term solution is
            defined and deployed to replace it."
    SYNTAX Counter64


ZeroBasedCounter64 ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This TC describes an object which counts events with the
            following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
            zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
            events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^64 is
            reached.

            Provided that an application discovers the new object within
            the minimum time to wrap it can use the initial value as a
            delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
            part.  It is important for a management station to be aware
            of this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and
            to discard data if the actual time is too long or there is
            no defined minimum time.

            Typically this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
            constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in
            use.

            Note that this textual convention does not retain all the
            semantics of the Counter64 base type. Specifically, a
            Counter64 has an arbitrary initial value, but objects
            defined with this TC are required to start at the value
            zero.  This behavior is not likely to have any adverse
            effects on management applications which are expecting
            Counter64 semantics.

10.  Security Considerations

This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it defines

define management objects.

Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the modules
that define management objects.
