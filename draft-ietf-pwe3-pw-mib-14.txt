1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be used to manage
   pseudowire (PW) services for transmission over a packet Switched
   Network (PSN) [RFC3931] [RFC4447].  This MIB module provides generic
   management of PWs which is common to all types of PSN and PW services
   defined by the IETF PWE3 Working Group.

   Comments should be made directly to the PWE3 mailing list at
   pwe3@ietf.org.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC3985] and [RFC3916].  Unless otherwise stated, the
   mechanisms of [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here.

5.  Overview

   The PWE3 MIB Modules architecture provides a layered modular model
   into which any supported emulated service can be connected to any
   supported PSN type.  This specific MIB module provides the glue for
   mapping between the emulated service onto the native PSN service.  As
   such the defining of a PW emulated service requires the use of at
   least three types of MIB modules.

   Starting from the emulated service, the first type is service-
   specific module, which is emulated signal type dependent.  These
   modules are defined in other documents.

   The second type is this module, the PW-STD-MIB module, which
   configures general parameters of the PW that are common to all types
   of emulated services and PSN types.

   The third type of modules is PSN-specific module.  There is a
   different module for each type of PSN.  These modules associate the
   PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN.
   These modules are defined in other documents.


6.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The MIB Module consists of five tables;

   - The generic configuration and status monitoring objects which are
   common to all service types and PSN types (pwTable).

   - The PW Performance Current Table (pwPerfCurrentTable) contains PW
   statistics for the current 15-minute period.

   - The PW Performance Interval Table (pwPerfIntervalTable) contains PW
   statistics for historical intervals (usually 96 15-minute entries to
   cover a 24 hour period).

   - The PW Performance one day Interval Table (pwPerf1DayIntervalTable)
   contains PW statistics for historical intervals accumulated per day.
   Usually 30 1-Day entries to cover a monthly period.

   - The mapping table (pwIndexMappingTable) enables the reverse mapping
   of unique PWid parameters [peer IP, PW type and PW ID] and the
   pwIndex.

Internet-Draft                   PW MIB                     January 2008


   - The mapping table (pwGenFecIndexMappingTable) enables the reverse
   mapping of unique PWid parameters used in genFecSignaling
   [pwGroupAttachmentID, pwLocalAttachmentID and pwPeerAttachmentID] and
   the pwIndex.

   This MIB module uses TCs from [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580],
   [RFC2863], [RFC3411], [RFC3593], [RFC3705], [RFC4001] and [PWTC], and
   references [RFC3413], [RFC4623] and [RFC4720].


7.  PW-STD-MIB Module Usage

   An entry in the PW table (pwTable) MUST exist for all PW types (ATM,
   FR, Ethernet, SONET, etc.).  This table holds generic parameters
   related to the PW creation and monitoring.

   A conceptual row can be created in the pwTable in one of the
   following ways:

   1) The operator creates a row in the PwTable when configuring the
   node for a new service.  This mode MUST be supported by the agent,
   and MUST be used when creating a non-signaled (manually assigned) PW.

   2) The agent MAY create a row in the PwTable if a signaling message
   has been received from a peer node for a combination of signaling
   identifications parameters already unknown to the local node.  This
   mode is OPTIONAL.

   3) The agent MAY create a row in the PwTable automatically due to
   some auto discovery application, or based on configuration that is
   done through non-SNMP applications.  This mode is OPTIONAL.

   - The agent than creates the rows in the (locally supported)
   performance tables and reverse mapping tables in PW-STD-MIB module.


8.  Relations to Other PWE3 MIB Modules

   - Based on the PSN type defined for the PW, a row is created in PSN
   specific module (for example [PWMPLSMIB]) and associated to the PW
   table by the common pwIndex.

   - Based on the PW type defined for the PW, a row is created in
   service-specific module (for example [CEPMIB]) and associated to the
   PW table by the common pwIndex.

   - Unless all the necessary entries in the applicable tables have been
   created and all the parameters have been consistently configured in

Internet-Draft                   PW MIB                     January 2008


   those tables, signaling cannot be performed from the local node, and
   the pwVcOperStatus should report 'notPresent'.


9.  Relations to the IF-MIB

   The PW in general is not an ifIndex [RFC2863] on its own, for agent
   scalability reasons.  The PW is typically associated via the PWE3 MIB
   modules to an ifIndex the PW is emulating.  This ifIndex may
   represent a physical entity - for example a PW emulating a SONET path
   as in CEP: The PW itself is not an ifIndex, however the PW-STD-CEP-
   MIB module associates the PW to the ifIndex of the path to be
   emulated.  In some cases, the PW will be associated to an ifIndex
   representing a virtual interface.  An example is VPLS service where
   the PW emulates a logical interface of a (logical) bridge.  The
   physical ports association to the VPLS service instance is defined in
   non-PW MIB modules in this case.

   Exception to the above MAY exist in some implementations, where it is
   convenient to manage the PW as an ifIndex in the ifTable.  A special
   ifType to represent a PW virtual interface (exact number to be
   assigned by IANA) will be used in the ifTable in this case.

   When the PW is managed as an ifIndex, by default it SHOULD NOT be
   stacked, i.e. this ifIndex SHOULD NOT be layered above the respective
   PSN tunnel ifIndex or the attachment circuit ifIndex or the interface
   carrying the attachment circuit.

   Note that the ifIndex that carries the PW toward/from the PSN is in
   general not explicitly configured via PWE3 MIB modules except in rare
   cases.  In most cases the PW is carried inside a PSN tunnel, and the
   interfaces carrying the tunnel are specified in the related MIB
   modules that control the PSN tunnels.


10.  PW Notifications

   This MIB module includes notifications for PW entering the up or down
   state, in accordance with the guidelines for interface notifications
   as described in [RFC2863].  Implementers should be aware that in many
   systems it is desired to correlate notifications, such that
   notifications will not be emitted if higher hierarchy (such as ports
   or tunnels) notifications are already in effect.  Specifically for
   PWs, it is anticipated that most network's equipment failures turn
   into lowerLayerDown state at the PW level, where higher hierarchy
   level notification has already been emitted.

   When a PW is represented as an ifIndex, it is RECOMMENDED that PW

Internet-Draft                   PW MIB                     January 2008


   notifications will be turned off, to avoid duplication with the
   ifIndex status change notifications.


11.  Example of the PW MIB Modules Usage

   In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects
   described in section 7 to set up a CEP PW over MPLS PSN.  While this
   example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it
   is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  It
   is meant to be read after going through the MIB itself.

   In this example a PW service for CEP is configured over an MPLS PSN
   (MPLS-TE tunnel).  It uses LDP as in [RFC4447] for service set-up.

   For the operation in the service specific MIB modules and the PSN
   specific MIB modules, see the specific MIB module memo.  This example
   is continued in the memo describing the PW-CEP-STD-MIB module (for
   example [CEPMIB]) and the PW-MPLS-STD-MIB module [PWMPLSMIB]).

         "This MIB module contains managed object definitions for
          pseudowire operation as in Bryant, S. and P. Pate, 'Pseudo
          Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture' [RFC3985],
          Martini, L., et al, 'Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using

          Townsley, M., et al, 'Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
          (Version 3)' [RFC3931].

          This MIB module enables the use of any underlying packet
          switched network (PSN). MIB nodules that will support
          PW operations over specific PSN types are defined in
          separate memos.

          The indexes for this MIB module are also used to index the
          PSN-specific tables and the PW-specific tables. The PW Type
          dictates which PW-specific MIB module to use.

          "A row in this table represents a pseudowire (PW) virtual
           connection across a packet network. It is indexed by
           pwIndex, which uniquely identifies a singular
           connection.
           A row can be created by an operator command from a
           management plan of a PE, by signaling or due to autodiscovery
           process. Operator's command can be issued via non SNMP
           application; in such case a row will be created implicitly
           by the agent.
           The read-create objects in this tables are divided into
           three categories:
           1) Objects that MUST NOT be changed after row activation.
           These are objects that define basic properties of the
           PW (for example type, destination, etc.).
           2) Objects that MAY be changed when the PW is

           defined as not active. A change of these objects involves
           re-signaling of the PW or it might be traffic affecting.
           PW not active is defined as one of the following
           conditions:
                  a) The pwRowStatus is notInService(2).
                  b) The pwRowStatus is notReady(3).
                  c) The pwAdminStatus is down(2).
           If the operator needs to change one of the values for an
           active row, the operator can either set the pwRowStatus to
           notInService(2) or set pwAdminStatus to down(2).
           Signaling (or traffic) is initiated again upon setting
           the pwRowStatus to active(1) or setting the pwAdminStatus
           to up(1) or testing(3) respectively.
           3) Objects that MAY be changed at any time.

           A PW MAY have an entry in the ifTable in addition to the
           entry in this table. In this case a special ifType for PW
           will be set in the ifTable, and the ifIndex in the ifTable
           of the PW will be set in the pwIfIndex object in this table.

           By default, all the read-create objects MUST NOT be
           changed after row activation, unless specifically indicated
           in the individual object description.

           Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a
           reboot, the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those
           entries. If the set of entries of a specific row are found to
           be non consistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus MUST be
           declared as notPresent(5).

14.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for configuration
   of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be
   incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwTable contains objects to configure PW parameters on a
      Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized access to objects in this
      table, could result in disruption of traffic on the network.  The
      objects pwUpDownNotifEnable and pwNotifRate control the reports
      from the network element to the EMS.  Unauthorized access to these
      objects could result in disruption of configuration and status
      change reporting, resulting mis-view of the network conditions.
      The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be



Nadeau & Zelig            Expires July 12, 2008                [Page 62]

Internet-Draft                   PW MIB                     January 2008


      considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST
      be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.
      Administrators should consider whether read access to these
      objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable
      under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwTable, pwPerfCurrentTable, pwPerfIntervalTable,
      pwPerf1DayIntervalTable, pwIndexMappingTable, pwPeerMappingTable
      and pwGenFecIndexMappingTable collectively show the pseudowire
      connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.  If an
      Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these
      tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly con8figured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


15.  IANA Considerations

15.1.  ifType for PW

   IANA has beeen requested to register a value for PW in the
   IANAifType-MIB called ifPwType.  When the assignment has been made,
   the RFC Editor is asked to document the value here.

Internet-Draft                   PW MIB                     January 2008


15.2.  PW MIB Modules OBJECT IDENTIFIER values

   A PW may appear as ifIndex in the ifTable, and therefore it is
   requested below that the pwStdMIB OBJECT IDENTIFIER will be assigned
   under the 'transmission' subtree, as the common practice in assigning
   OBJECT IDENTIFIERs for MIB modules representing entities in the
   ifTable.

   All other MIB modules related to PW management SHOULD be assigned
   under the 'mib-2' subtree, individual request will appear in the MIB
   module memo IANA Considerations section.

15.3.  IANA Considerations for PW-STD-MIB

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         pwStdMIB         { transmission ZZZZ }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "ZZZZ" under the 'transmission'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   This value SHOULD be the same value assigned for the PW ifType for
   representation of the PW in the ifTable.  When the assignment has
   been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "ZZZZ" (here and in the
   MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.

15.4.  IANA Considerations for IANA-PWE3-MIB

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         ianaPwe3MIB       { mib-2 XXXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
