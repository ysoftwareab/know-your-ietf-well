Abstract

This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for configuring
and managing TN3270E servers.  TN3270E, defined by RFC 1647 [15], refers
to the enhancements made to the Telnet 3270 (TN3270) terminal emulation
practices.  Refer to RFC 1041 [14], RFC 854 [12], and RFC 860 [13] for a
sample of what is meant by TN3270 practices.


The MIB defined by this memo provides generic support for both host and
gateway TN3270E server implementations.  A TN3270E server connects a
Telnet client performing 3270 emulation to a target SNA host over both a
client-side network (client to TN3270E server) and an SNA Network
(TN3270E server to target SNA host).  The client-side network is
typically TCP/IP, but it need not be.

A host TN3270E server refers to an implementation where the TN3270E
server is collocated with the Systems Network Architecture (SNA) System

Services Control Point (SSCP) for the dependent Secondary Logical Units
(SLUs) that the server makes available to its clients for connecting
into a SNA network.  A gateway TN3270E server resides on an SNA node
other than an SSCP, either an SNA type 2.0 node, a
boundary-function-attached type 2.1 node, or an APPN node acting in the
role of a Dependent LU Requester (DLUR).  Host and gateway TN3270E
server implementations typically differ greatly as to their internal
implementation and system definition (SYSDEF) methods.

It is the intent that the MIB defined herein be extended by subsequent
memos.  For example, one such extension enables collection of TN3270E
response time data.  The specification of this MIB uses the Structure of
Management Information (SMI) for Version 2 of the Simple Network
Management Protocol (refer to RFC1902 [3]).

1.0  Introduction

This document is a product of the TN3270E Working Group.  Its purpose is
to define a MIB module for support by a TCP/IP implementation for
configuration and management of TN3270E servers.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference [18].


2.0  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of six major
components.  They are:

o   the overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [7].

o   the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [3], - the mechanisms used for
    describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

o   the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2], - the core set of managed objects
    for the Internet suite of protocols.

o   the protocol, RFC 1157 [1] and/or RFC 1905 [6] and/or RFC 2272 [8]
    -- the protocol for accessing managed information.

o   the user-based security model defined in RFC 2274 [10].

o   the view-based access control model defined in RFC 2275 [11].

Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [4], and conformance
statements are defined in RFC 1904 [5].  Common applications are defined
in RFC 2273 [9].

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translation.


3.0  Structure of the MIB

The TN3270E-MIB is split into the following components:

o   TN3270E Server Control
o   TN3270E Server Resource Configuration
o   Resource/Client Address Mappings

There are three additional sections to address:

o   Advisory Spin Lock Usage
o   Row Persistence

Internet Draft                TN3270E MIB                      June 1998

o   IANA Considerations

The TN3270E-MIB is defined primarily for TN3270E servers.  This memo
does not explicitly address use of the MIB by TN3270 servers that do not
support the TN3270E protocol.  Even though a significant number of the
objects in the MIB do apply in the TN3270-only case, the case was not
addressed, since it is unlikely that a TN3270-only server would
implement this MIB.

The SYSAPPL-MIB, reference [20], contains the Utf8String textual
convention (TC) that the TN3270E-MIB imports.  This TC, which is used
for some MIB objects containing textual information, enables
internationalization of text strings, whereas the DisplayString TC does
not.  The SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB, reference [7], contains the
SnmpAdminString TC that the TN3270E-MIB also imports.  Like the
Utf8String TC, this TC also enables internationalization of text
strings; in addition, it provides some guidelines on the length and
content of the strings.

It is important to note that implementation of the SYSAPPL-MIB is not
actually a prerequisite for implementing the TN3270E-MIB.  On the other
hand, implementation of the TN3270E-MIB does not preclude implementing
the SYSAPPL-MIB as well.  When both MIBs are implemented, the primary
index into most of the TN3270E-MIB tables, tn3270eSrvrConfIndex, SHOULD
equal one of the SYSAPPL-MIB's sysApplElmtRunIndex values.  In this case
the entry in the sysApplElmtRunTable provides additional information on
a TN3270E server.

The MIB defined by this memo supports use of both IPv4 and IPv6
addressing.  Two textual conventions, IANATn3270eAddrType and
Tn3270eTAddress, are defined for this purpose.  IANATn3270eTAddress is
essentially equivalent to the TAddress TC, defined by RFC 1903.  The
difference between the two is that IANATn3270eTAddress allows a
zero-length octet string, while TAddress doesn't.  It is important that
IANATn3270eTAddress allow for the absence of an address, because some
objects with this syntax are used as table indexes, and have special
meanings when they contain zero-length strings.

The IANATn3270eAddrType textual convention is used rather than the
TDomain TC (defined by RFC 1903) for identifying the contents of a
tn3270eTAddress object.  TDomain uses an OID to characterize the
contents of an associated TAddress object.  IANATn3270eAddrType was
chosen over TDomain because, with a SYNTAX of Unsigned32 (enumeration
type), it is much simpler to use as a component in an instance
identifier.  It was placed in the IANA-administered module to allow for
the addition of values to cover cases (such as proxy servers) not
covered by the TN3270E-MIB itself.

3.1  TN3270E Server Control

This group of objects provides for TN3270E server configuration and
control.  It consists of three tables:

o   tn3270eSrvrConfTable
o   tn3270eSrvrPortTable

TN3270E Working Group    Expires December 1998                  [Page 4]

Internet Draft                TN3270E MIB                      June 1998

o   tn3270eSrvrStatsTable

The tn3270eSrvrConfTable is the primary table within the entire
TN3270E-MIB.  As section 3.1.1 indicates, each TN3270E server is
represented by an entry in this table, indexed by tn3270eSrvrConfIndex.
Most of the other tables defined by the TN3270E-MIB have
tn3270eSrvrConfIndex as their primary index.  Entries in these tables
MUST NOT exist for a TN3270E server when it does not have a
tn3270eSrvrConfigEntry.

3.1.1  tn3270eSrvrConfTable

The tn3270eSrvrConfTable contains a set of objects primarily used for
configuring and managing TN3270E servers.  As with most of the other
tables in the TN3270E-MIB, this table is indexed by an unsigned integer,
tn3270eSrvrConfIndex.  This primary index element enables support of
multiple TN3270E servers by a single SNMP agent.  Within the set of MIB
objects returned by one SNMP agent, tn3270eSrvrConfIndex values MUST be
unique, and need not be contiguous.

The tn3270eSrvrConfInactivityTimer object defines the inactivity period
for user traffic on TN3270 and TN3270E sessions.

The four objects:

o   tn3270eSrvrConfConnectivityChk
o   tn3270eSrvrConfTmNopInterval
o   tn3270eSrvrConfTmNopInactTime
o   tn3270eSrvrConfTmTimeout

define the parameters for performing the "Telnet Timing Mark Option" as
defined by RFC 860 [13].  The object tn3270eSrvrConfConnectivityChk
allows a Management Station to select either a NOP command or a
TIMING-MARK command.  Sending a NOP command results in less overhead
then a TIMING-MARK command, since a client doesn't send a reply.

The objects tn3270eSrvrConfAdminStatus and tn3270eSrvrConfOperStatus
enable remote starting and stopping of a TN3270E server, and report the
current state of the server.  The object
tn3270eSrvrConfFunctionsSupported indicates which of the TN3270 and
TN3270E options a server supports.  The object
tn3270eSrvrConfSessionTermState defines as a TN3270E server-wide option
what SHOULD occur when the SNA portion of a TN3270 or TN3270E session
terminates with respect to the associated TCP connection.  The object
tn3270eSrvrConfSrvrType indicates whether the TN3270E server represented
by a tn3270eSrvrConfEntry is a host or a gateway server.  The object
tn3270eSrvrConfContact provides a scratch pad area for a TN3270E server
administrator to store information for later retrieval.  The object
tn3270eSrvrConfLastActTime reports the DateAndTime when the server was
most recently activated.  The special value of all '00'Hs indicates that
the server has never been active.

The object tn3270eSrvrConfRowStatus provides the capability to perform
row creation and deletion operations on this table.

3.1.2  tn3270eSrvrPortTable

The tn3270eSrvrPortTable represents the local TCP ports associated with
a TN3270E server.  This information is important because some TN3270E
server implementations support usage of multiple local ports.  A
tn3270eSrvrPortEntry is indexed by:

o   tn3270eSrvrConfIndex
o   tn3270eSrvrConfPort
o   tn3270eSrvrConfPortAddrType
o   tn3270eSrvrConfPortAddress

Certain TN3270E server implementations restrict a local TCP port to a
particular local IP address, instead of allowing connections for any
local IP address to occur via the port.  tn3270eSrvrConfPortAddrType and
tn3270eSrvrConfPortAddress allow this restriction to be represented in
the MIB.  A TN3270E server that doesn't restrict connections over a port
to a local IP Address SHALL use the value unknown(0) for
tn3270eSrvrConfPortAddrType, and a zero-length octet string for
tn3270eSrvrConfPortAddress.

3.1.3  tn3270eSrvrStatsTable

The tn3270eSrvrStatsTable defines a series of objects that provide
general usage statistics for a TN3270E server.  An entry can represent
the total activity for a server, or it can represent the activity
occurring at the server on either a port or a port-and-local-address
basis.

An implementation of this table MUST use only one of the three levels of
refinement that the indexing of this table supports for the entries
associated with a single TN3270E server.

The objects in this table reporting maximum, in-use, and spare LUs for
terminals and printers presuppose an implementation where terminal
resources and printer resources come from disjoint, dedicated pools.  An
implementation where resources for the two types of LUs come from a
single shared pool should return the following values:

o   maximum:  maximum size of the shared pool
o   in-use:   number currently in use as this type of LU
o   spare:    maximum - (terminal in-use + printer in-use)

3.2  TN3270E Server Resource Configuration

The following three tables provide for configuration of resources at a
TN3270E server:

o   tn3270eClientGroupTable
o   tn3270eResPoolTable
o   tn3270eClientResMapTable

tn3270eClientGroupTable and tn3270eResPoolTable enable implementations
to define groupings of both client addresses and resource pools for

Internet Draft                TN3270E MIB                      June 1998

mapping client addresses to resources.  The tn3270eClientResMapTable
provides a mapping from a client group to a resource pool.

3.3  Resource Name / Client Address Mappings

The TN3270E-MIB contains three tables for mapping resource names to
client addresses, and client addresses to resource names:

o   tn3270eSnaMapTable
o   tn3270eResMapTable
o   tn3270eTcpConnTable

3.3.1  tn3270eSnaMapTable

The tn3270eSnaMapTable is a read-only table that maps a secondary LU's
SNA network name to the name by which it is known locally at the TN3270E
server.  For correlation with data from the SNA network, the name of the
associated primary LU also appears in a tn3270eSnaMapEntry.  An entry in
this table is created when the Activate LU (ACTLU) request carrying the
SNA network name of the SLU is received from the SSCP.  The entry is
deleted when the SLU is deactivated.

A TN3270E server provides a client with access to an SNA application by
associating a TCP connection from the client with an SNA secondary LU
(SLU) at the server.  This SLU in turn has an SNA session with a primary
LU (PLU) running on an SNA host.  This PLU represents the application
with which the client is communicating.  The TN3270E-MIB includes two
tables for mapping back and forth among the SNA name identifying the
PLU, the SNA name identifying the SLU, and the TCP connection with the
client.

In order to understand how these name mappings work, it is necessary to
understand a subtlety involving the names of the SLUs at the TN3270E
server:  these names are often different from the names by which the
SLUs are known in the rest of the SNA network.  In the TN3270E-MIB,
these two types of SLU names are termed "local names" and "SSCP-supplied
names"; the latter term indicates that the name by which the SLU is
known in the SNA network comes to the TN3270E server from the SNA System
Services Control Point.

SSCPs don't always send SLU names down to secondary LUs; in some cases
this capability must be turned on.  In the case of SLUs served by a
Dependent LU Requester (DLUR), an SSCP always sends SLU names to the
DLUR.  It is necessary, however, to enable the DLUR's PU/LU Network Name
Forwarding function, so that it forwards the SLU names it receives from
the SSCP down to the PUs that it serves.

For SLUs associated with an SNA type 2.0 node (or with a
boundary-function-attached type 2.1 node) not served by a DLUR,
inclusion of SLU names on ACTLU must be enabled explicitly at the SSCP
via local configuration.

3.3.2  tn3270eResMapTable

Internet Draft                TN3270E MIB                      June 1998

The tn3270eResMapTable is a read-only table that maps a resource name to
a client's address.  An entry in this table is created when a TCP
connection is received by a TN3270E server and mapped to a resource.
The entry is deleted when the resource-to-address association is no
longer valid.

3.3.3  tn3270eTcpConnTable

The TCP Connection Table is currently defined by RFC 2012 (Refer to
reference [16], TCP-MIB Definitions).  It contains the following
objects:

o   tcpConnState (INTEGER)
o   tcpConnLocalAddress (IpAddress)
o   tcpConnLocalPort (INTEGER)
o   tcpConnRemAddress (IpAddress)
o   tcpConnRemPort (INTEGER)

It is indexed by: tcpConnLocalAddress, tcpConnLocalPort,
tcpConnRemAddress, and tcpConnRemPort.

The tn3270eTcpConnTable contains objects for keeping a list of the
current set of TN3270 and TN3270E sessions at a TN3270E server.  The
relationship between the tcpConnTable and the Tn3270eTcpConnTable is not
one-to-one, since the tn3270eTcpConnTable contains information
pertaining only to TN3270(E) sessions.

The tn3270eTcpConnTable has a different indexing structure from that of
the tcpConnTable.  Instead of using IpAddress objects, Tn3270eTAddress
and IANATn3270eAddrType object pairs are used to specify client
addresses (both local and remote).  This enables support of IPv6
addresses.  In addition, the remote address pair precedes the local
address pair in the index clause, in order to enable a GET-NEXT
operation using only the remote address pair.

3.4  Advisory Spin Lock Usage

Within the TN3270E-MIB, tn3270eConfSpinLock is defined as an advisory
lock that allows cooperating TN3270E-MIB applications to coordinate
their use of the tn3270eSrvrConfTable, the tn3270eSrvrPortTable, the
tn3270eClientGroupTable, the tn3270eResPoolTable, and the
tn3270eClientResMapTable.  When creating a new entry or altering an
existing entry in any of these tables, an application SHOULD make use of
tn3270eConfSpinLock to serialize application changes or additions.
Since this is an advisory lock, its use by management applications SHALL
NOT be enforced by agents.  Agents MUST, however, implement the
tn3270eConfSpinLock object.

3.5  Row Persistence

The following tables enable remote creation of their entries by
including RowStatus objects:

o   tn3270eSrvrConfTable
o   tn3270eSrvrPortTable

TN3270E Working Group    Expires December 1998                  [Page 8]

Internet Draft                TN3270E MIB                      June 1998

o   tn3270eClientGroupTable
o   tn3270eResPoolTable
o   tn3270eClientResMapTable

An implementation SHOULD NOT retain SNMP-created entries in these tables
across reIPLs (Initial Program Loads) of the corresponding TN3270E
server, since management applications need to see consistent behavior
with respect to the persistence of the table entries that they create.

It is expected that local, implementation-dependent configuration
information will be used to define the initial and persistent
configurations for TN3270E server usage.  Thus it is not necessary to
enable persistence of table entries by adding StorageType (refer to RFC
1903 [4]) objects to these tables.

3.6  IANA Considerations

The tn3270eSrvrFunctionsSupported, tn3270eTcpConnFunctions,
tn3270eTcpConnClientIdFormat, and tn3270eTcpConnLogInfo objects, as well
as a number of objects identifying the types of various addresses, use
textual conventions imported from the IANATn3270eTC-MIB.  The purpose of
defining these textual conventions in a separate MIB module is to allow
additional values to be defined without having to issue a new version of
this document.  The Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) is
responsible for the assignment of all Internet numbers, including
various SNMP-related numbers; it will administer the values associated
with these textual conventions.

The rules for additions or changes to the IANATn3270eTC-MIB are outlined
in the DESCRIPTION clause associated with its MODULE-IDENTITY statement.

The current version of the IANATn3270eTC-MIB can be accessed from the
IANA home page at: "http://www.iana.org/iana/".

      DESCRIPTION
          "The textual convention for defining an SNA resource
           name. A fully qualified SNA resource name, consisting
           of a 1 to 8 character network identifier (NetId), a
           period ('.'), and a 1 to 8 character resource name
           (ResName).

           The NetId and ResName are constructed from the
           uppercase letters 'A' - 'Z' and the numerics '0' - '9',
           all encoded in ASCII, with the restriction that the
           first character of each must be a letter.  Blanks are
           not allowed.

           Earlier versions of SNA permitted three additional
           characters in NetIds and ResNames:  '#', '@', and '$'.
           While this use of these characters has been retired,
           a Management Station should still accept them for
           backward compatibility.

           Note: This Textual Convention is not subject to
           internationalization, and does not use the character
           encodings used by the Utf8String Textual Convention."

      DESCRIPTION
          "An octet string representing trace data from the
          Telnet half of a TN3270E session, from the SNA half,
          or from both.  The octet string contains a sequence
          of trace elements, with the trace elements in the
          string ordered from earliest to latest.

          Each trace element has the following form:

                  +---+---+----+----------------------+
                  !length !type!data                  !

            length = two-octet length of the data portion of the
                     trace element, not including the length and
                     type octets

            type   = one-octet code point characterizing the data;
                     defined values are:

                     X'01' telnet PDU from the server to the client
                     X'02' telnet PDU from the client to the server

                     X'04' SNA data from the SNA host to the server

            data   = initial part of a PDU.

          It is implementation-dependent where the 'initial part of
          a PDU' starts.  For SNA data, however, the starting point
          SHOULD be the first byte of the TH.  For IP data the
          starting point SHOULD be the first byte of the IP header.

          It is left to implementations to determine how much of
          each PDU to return in a trace element.

          The zero-length string indicates that no trace
          data is available."

           A TN3270E server that does not distinguish between
           down(2) or stopImmediate(3) transitions should not
           support stopImmediate(3)."

          "This object indicates the type of TN3270E server.
          The existence of MIB tables and objects that will be
          defined by follow-on MIBs may be predicated on whether
          the TN3270E server can be local to the same host as a
          target application (host(1)) or will always be remote
          (gateway(2)).

          A host TN3270E server refers to an implementation where
          the TN3270E server is collocated with the Systems
          Network Architecture (SNA) System Services Control Point
          (SSCP) for the dependent Secondary Logical Units (SLUs)
          that the server makes available to its clients for
          connecting into an SNA network.

          A gateway TN3270E server resides on an SNA node other
          than an SSCP, either an SNA type 2.0 node or an APPN node
          acting in the role of a Dependent LU Requester (DLUR).

          Host and gateway TN3270E server implementations typically
          differ greatly as to their internal implementation and
          system definition (SYSDEF) requirements."

          created and deleted as a result of implementation-
          dependent operations.

          With the exception of tn3270eSrvrConfSrvrType, which
          an implementation can easily fill in for itself, all
          the columnar objects in this table have DEFVALs
          associated with them.  Consequently, a Management
          Station can create a conceptual row via a SET
          operation that specifies a value only for this object.

          When a tn3270eSrvrConfEntry is deleted (by setting
          this object to destroy(6)), this has the side-effect
          of removing all the associated entries (i.e., those
          having the same tn3270eSrvrConfIndex) from the
          tn3270eSrvrPortTable, the tn3270eSrvrStatsTable, the

          tn3270eTcpConnTable that belong to a TN3270E server
          that has been deleted MUST also be removed.

          In other words, a tn3270eSrvrConfEntry must exist for
          a TN3270E server in order for it to have entries in
          any of the other tables defined by this MIB."

         It is possible that the difference between

         in a conceptual row does not equal the value of
         tn3270eSrvrStatsSparePtrs in that row:  a printer
         resource may exist but not be usable by a client
         connection.

         Alternatively, the administrative ceiling represented
         by tn3270eSrvrStatsMaxPtrs may have been lowered to
         a point where it is less than the current value of
         tn3270eSrvrStatsInUsePtrs.  In this case
         tn3270eSrvrStatsSparePtrs returns the value 0."

          Assigning multiple client groups to the same resource
          pool is also allowed, but is not the primary purpose

           The IF-MIB (RFC 2233) requires that the 64-bit
           versions of its counters be implemented when an
           interface can support rates of around 20 million
           bits per second or greater.  This implies a minimum
           wrap rate of just over 28 minutes.  It is recommended
           that this same guideline be used for determining
           whether an implementation implements these objects.

           This group contains two objects with the syntax
           Counter64.  An implementation that doesn't support
           these objects should return noSuchObject, since
           returning a zero is misleading."

5.0  Security Considerations

Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information
SHOULD be employed in such environments.  An authentication protocol is
defined in [10].  A protocol for access control is defined in [11].

Several objects in this MIB allow write access or provide for row
creation.  Allowing this support in a non-secure environment can have a
negative effect on network operations.  It is RECOMMENDED that
implementers seriously consider whether set operations or row creation
should be allowed without providing, at a minimum, authentication of
request origin.  It is RECOMMENDED that without such support, the
following objects be implemented as read-only:

o   tn3270eSrvrConfInactivityTimout
o   tn3270eSrvrConfConnectivityChk
o   tn3270eSrvrConfActivityTimeout
o   tn3270eSrvrConfActivityInterval
o   tn3270eSrvrConfAdminStatus
o   tn3270eSrvrConfSessionTermState
o   tn3270eSrvrConfContact
o   tn3270eClientGroupSubnetMask
o   tn3270eResPoolElementType
o   tn3270eSrvrConfRowStatus
o   tn3270eSrvrPortRowStatus
o   tn3270eClientGroupRowStatus
o   tn3270eResPoolRowStatus
o   tn3270eResMapRowStatus

For all tables in the MIB except the tn3270eTcpConnTable, the first
index identifies an individual TN3270E server.  This makes it easy to
implement an access control policy under which different principals have
access to objects related to different servers.  Implementation of such
a policy is not possible for the entries in the tn3270eTcpConTable.

                          data by the receiver of the data.
          RFC860
          timingMark      The sender of this command REQUESTS
                          that the receiver of this command
                          return a WILL TIMING-MARK in the data

          RFC885
          endOfRecord     The sender of this command requests
                          permission to begin transmission of
                          the Telnet END-OF-RECORD (EOR) code
                          when transmitting data characters, or
                          the sender of this command confirms it
                          will now begin transmission of EORs
                          with transmitted data characters.

          scsCtlCodes     (Printer sessions only).  Allows the
                          use of the SNA Character Stream (SCS)
                          and SCS control codes on the session.
                          SCS is used with LU type 1 SNA sessions.
          dataStreamCtl   (Printer sessions only).  Allows the use
                          of the standard 3270 data stream.  This
                          corresponds to LU type 3 SNA sessions.
