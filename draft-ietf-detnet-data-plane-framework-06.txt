1.  Introduction

   DetNet (Deterministic Networking) provides a capability to carry
   specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
   with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end

   delivery latency.  A description of the general background and
   concepts of DetNet can be found in [RFC8655].

   This document describes the concepts needed by any DetNet data plane
   specification (i.e., the DetNet-specific use of packet header fields)
   and provides considerations for any corresponding implementation.  It
   covers the building blocks that provide the DetNet service, the
   DetNet service sub-layer and the DetNet forwarding sub-layer
   functions as described in the DetNet Architecture.

   The DetNet Architecture models the DetNet related data plane
   functions as being decomposed into two sub-layers: a service sub-
   layer and a forwarding sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to
   provide DetNet service protection and reordering.  The forwarding
   sub-layer leverages Traffic Engineering mechanisms and provides
   congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and limited out-of-
   order delivery).  A particular forwarding sub-layer may have
   capabilities that are not available on other forwarding-sub layers.
   DetNet makes use of the existing forwarding sub-layers with their
   respective capabilities and does not require 1:1 equivalence between
   different forwarding sub-layer capabilities.

   As part of the service sub-layer functions, this document describes
   typical DetNet node data plane operation.  It describes the
   functionality and operation of the Packet Replication (PRF), Packet
   Elimination (PEF), and the Packet Ordering (POF) functions within the
   service sub-layer.  Furthermore, it describes the forwarding sub-
   layer.

   As defined in [RFC8655], DetNet flows may be carried over network
   technologies that can provide the DetNet required service
   characteristics.  For example, DetNet MPLS flows can be carried over
   IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Network (TSN) [IEEE802.1TSNTG] sub-
   networks.  However, IEEE 802.1 TSN support is not required in DetNet.
   TSN frame preemption is an example of a forwarding layer capability
   that is typically not replicated in other forwarding technologies.
   Most of DetNet benefits can be gained by running over a data link
   layer that has not been specifically enhanced to support all TSN
   capabilities but for such networks and traffic mixes delay and jitter
   performance may vary due to the forwarding sub-layer intrinsic
   properties.

   Different application flows, such as Ethernet or IP, can be mapped on
   top of DetNet.  DetNet can optionally reuse header information
   provided by, or shared with, applications.  An example of shared
   header fields can be found in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   This document also covers basic concepts related to the controller
   plane and Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  Data
   plane OAM specifics are out of scope for this document.

3.  DetNet Data Plane Overview

   This document describes how application flows, or app-flows, are
   carried over DetNet networks.  The DetNet Architecture [RFC8655]
   models the DetNet-related data plane functions as decomposed into two
   sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding sub-layer.

   Figure 1, reproduced from [RFC8655], shows a logical DetNet service
   with the two sub-layers.

   The DetNet forwarding sub-layer may be directly provided by the
   DetNet service sub-layer, for example by IP tunnels or MPLS.
   Alternatively, an overlay approach may be used in which the packet is
   natively carried between key nodes within the DetNet network (say
   between PREOF nodes) and a sub-layer is used to provide the
   information needed to reach the next hop in the overlay.

   The forwarding sub-layer provides the QoS related functions needed by
   the DetNet flow.  It may do this directly through the use of queuing
   techniques and traffic engineering methods, or it may do this through
   the assistance of its underlying connectivity.  For example it may
   call upon Ethernet TSN capabilities defined in IEEE 802.1 TSN
   [IEEE802.1TSNTG].  The forwarding sub-layer uses buffer resources for
   packet queuing, as well as reservation and allocation of bandwidth
   capacity resources.

   The service sub-layer provides additional support beyond the
   connectivity function of the forwarding sub-layer.  See Section 4.3
   as an example for Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering
   functions.  The ordering function (POF) uses sequence numbers added
   to packets enabling a range of packet order protection from simple
   ordering and dropping out-of-order packets to more complex reordering
   of a fixed number of out-of-order, minimally delayed packets.
   Reordering requires buffer resources and has impact on the delay and
   jitter of packets in the DetNet flow.

   The method of instantiating each of the layers is specific to the
   particular DetNet data plane method, and more than one approach may
   be applicable to a given network type.

3.1.  Data Plane Characteristics

   There are two major characteristics to the data plane: the technology
   and the encapsulation, as discussed below.

3.1.1.  Data Plane Technology

   The DetNet data plane is provided by the DetNet service and
   forwarding sub layers.  The DetNet service sub-layer generally
   provides its functions for the DetNet application flows by using or
   applying existing standardized headers and/or encapsulations.  The
   Detnet forwarding sub-layer may provide capabilities leveraging that
   same header or encapsulation technology (e.g., DN IP or DN MPLS) or
   it may be achieved by other technologies as shown in Figure 2.
   DetNet is currently defined for operation over packet-switched (IP)
   networks or label-switched (MPLS) networks.

3.1.2.  Encapsulation

   DetNet encodes specific flow attributes (flow identity and sequence
   number) in packets.  For example, in DetNet IP, zero encapsulation is
   used and no sequence number is available, and in DetNet MPLS, DetNet-
   specific information may be added explicitly to the packets in the
   form of S-label and d-CW [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] .

   The encapsulation of a DetNet flow allows it to be sent over a data
   plane technology other than its native type.  DetNet uses header
   information to perform traffic classification, i.e., identify DetNet
   flows, and provide DetNet service and forwarding functions.  As
   mentioned above, DetNet may add headers, as is the case for DN MPLS,
   or may use headers that are already present, as is the case in DN IP.
   Figure 2 illustrates some relationships between the components.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   The use of encapsulation is also required if additional information
   (metadata) is needed by the DetNet data plane and there is either no
   ability to include it in the client data packet, or the specification
   of the client data plane does not permit the modification of the
   packet to include additional data.  An example of such metadata is
   the inclusion of a sequence number required by the PREOF function.

   Encapsulation may also be used to carry or aggregate flows for
   equipment with limited DetNet capability.

3.2.  DetNet-specific Metadata

   The DetNet data plane can provide or carry the following metadata:

   1.  Flow-ID

   2.  Sequence Number

   The DetNet data plane framework supports a Flow-ID (for
   identification of the flow or aggregate flow) and/or a Sequence
   Number (for PREOF) for each DetNet flow.  The Flow-ID is used by both
   the service and forwarding sub-layers, but the sequence number is
   only used by the service layer.  Metadata can also be used for OAM
   indications and instrumentation of DetNet data plane operation.

   Metadata inclusion can be implicit or explicit.  Explicit inclusions
   involve a dedicated header field that is used to include metadata in
   a DetNet packet.  In the implicit method, part of an already existing
   header field is used to encode the metadata.

   Explicit inclusion of metadata is possible through the use of IP
   options or IP extension headers.  New IP options are almost
   impossible to get standardized or to deploy in an operational network
   and will not be discussed further in this text.  IPv6 extensions
   headers are finding popularity in current IPv6 development work,
   particularly in connection with Segment Routing of IPv6 (SRv6) and IP
   OAM.  The design of a new IPv6 extension header or the modification
   of an existing one is a technique available in the tool box of the
   DetNet IP data plane designer.

   Explicit inclusion of metadata in an IP packet is also possible
   through the inclusion of an MPLS label stack and the MPLS DetNet
   Control Word using one of the methods for carrying MPLS over IP
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-udp-ip].  This is described in more detail
   in Section 3.5.5.

   Implicit metadata in IP can be included through the use of the
   network programming paradigm



Varga, et al.           Expires November 7, 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] in which the suffix of an
   IPv6 address is used to encode additional information for use by the
   network of the receiving host.

   An MPLS example of explicit metadata is the sequence number used by
   the PREOF function, or even the case where all the essential
   information being included into the DetNet over MPLS label stack (the
   DetNet Control Word and the DetNet Service label).

3.3.  DetNet IP Data Plane

   An IP data plane may operate natively or through the use of an
   encapsulation.  Many types of IP encapsulation can satisfy DetNet
   requirements and it is anticipated that more than one encapsulation
   may be deployed, for example GRE, IPSec.

   One method of operating an IP DetNet data plane without encapsulation
   is to use "6-tuple" based flow identification, where "6-tuple" refers
   to information carried in IP and higher layer protocol headers.
   General background on the use of IP headers, and "6-tuples", to
   identify flows and support Quality of Service (QoS) can be found in
   [RFC3670].  [RFC7657] provides useful background on differentiated
   services (DiffServ) and "tuple" based flow identification.  DetNet
   flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of wildcards, masks,
   prefixes and ranges.  The operation of this method is described in
   detail in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   The DetNet forwarding plane may use explicit route capabilities and
   traffic engineering capabilities to provide a forwarding sub-layer
   that is responsible for providing resource allocation and explicit
   routes.  It is possible to include such information in a native IP
   packet explicitly, or implicitly.

3.4.  DetNet MPLS Data Plane

   MPLS provides a forwarding sub-layer for traffic over implicit and
   explicit paths to the point in the network where the next DetNet
   service sub-layer action needs to take place.  It does this through
   the use of a stack of one or more labels with various forwarding
   semantics.

   MPLS also provides the ability to identify a service instance that is
   used to process the packet through the use of a label that maps the
   packet to a service instance.

   In cases where metadata is needed to process an MPLS encapsulated
   packet at the service sub-layer, the d-CW [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls],
   [RFC4385] can be used.  Although such d-CWs are frequently 32 bits



Varga, et al.           Expires November 7, 2020                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   long, there is no architectural constraint on the size of this
   structure, only the requirement that it is fully understood by all
   parties operating on it in the DetNet service sub-layer.  The
   operation of this method is described in detail in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

3.5.  Further DetNet Data Plane Considerations

   This section provides informative considerations related to providing
   DetNet service to flows which are identified based on their header
   information.

3.5.1.  Per Flow Related Functions

   At a high level, the following functions are provided on a per flow
   basis.

3.5.1.1.  Reservation and Allocation of resources

   Resources might be reserved in order to make them available for
   allocation to specific DetNet flows.  This can eliminate packet
   contention and packet loss for DetNet traffic.  This also can reduce
   jitter for DetNet traffic.  Resources allocated to a DetNet flow
   protect it from other traffic flows.  On the other hand, DetNet flows
   are assumed to behave with respect to the reserved traffic profile.
   It must be possible to detect misbehaving DetNet flows and to ensure
   that they do not compromise QoS of other flows.  Queuing, policing,
   and shaping policies can be used to ensure that the allocation of
   resources reserved for DetNet is met.

3.5.1.2.  Explicit routes

   A flow can be routed over a specific, pre-computed path.  This allows
   control of the network delay by steering the packet with the ability
   to influence the physical path.  Explicit routes complement
   reservation by ensuring that a consistent path can be associated with
   its resources for the duration of that path.  Coupled with the
   traffic mechanism, this limits misordering and bounds latency.
   Explicit route computation can encompass a wide set of constraints
   and can optimize the path for a certain characteristic, e.g., highest
   bandwidth or lowest jitter.  In these cases the "best" path for any
   set of characteristics may not be a shortest path.  The selection of
   path can take into account multiple network metrics.  Some of these
   metrics are measured and distributed by the routing system as traffic
   engineering metrics.

3.5.1.3.  Service protection

   Service protection involves use of multiple packet streams using
   multiple paths, for example 1+1 or 1:1 linear protection.  For
   DetNet, this primarily relates to packet replication and elimination
   capabilities.  MPLS offers a number of protection schemes.  MPLS
   hitless protection can be used to switch traffic to an already
   established path in order to restore delivery rapidly after a
   failure.  Path changes, even in the case of failure recovery, can
   lead to the out of order delivery of data requiring packet ordering
   functions either within the DetNet service or at a high layer in the
   application traffic.  Establishment of new paths after a failure is
   out of scope for DetNet services.

3.5.1.4.  Network Coding

   Network Coding [nwcrg], not to be confused with network programming,
   comprises several techniques where multiple data flows are encoded.
   These resulting flows can then be sent on different paths.  The
   encoding operation can combine flows and error recovery information.
   When the encoded flows are decoded and recombined the original flows
   can be recovered.  Note that Network coding uses an alternative to
   packet by packet PREOF.  Therefore, for certain network topologies
   and traffic loads, Network Coding can be used to improve a network's
   throughput, efficiency, latency, and scalability, as well as
   resilience to partition, attacks, and eavesdropping, as compared to
   traditional methods.  DetNet could use Network coding as an
   alternative to other protection means.  Network coding is often
   applied in wireless networks and is being explored for other network
   types.

3.5.1.5.  Load sharing

   Use of packet-by-packet load sharing of the same DetNet flow over
   multiple paths is not recommended except for the cases listed above
   where PREOF is utilized to improve protection of traffic and maintain
   order.  Packet-by-packet load sharing, e.g., via ECMP or UCMP,
   impacts ordering and possibly jitter.

3.5.1.6.  Troubleshooting

   Detnet leverages many different forwarding sub-layers, each of which
   supports various tools to troubleshoot connectivity, for example
   identification of misbehaving flows.  The DetNet Service layer can
   leverage existing mechanisms to troubleshoot or monitor flows, such
   as those in use by IP and MPLS networks.  At the Application layer a
   client of a DetNet service can use existing techniques to detect and
   monitor delay and loss.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


3.5.1.7.  Flow recognition for analytics

   Network analytics can be inherited from the technologies of the
   Service and Forwarding sub-layers.  At the DetNet service edge,
   packet and bit counters (e.g. sent, received, dropped, and out-of-
   sequence) can be maintained.

3.5.1.8.  Correlation of events with flows

   The provider of a DetNet service may provide other capabilities to
   monitor flows, such as more detailed loss statistics and time
   stamping of events.  The details of these capabilities are out of
   scope for this document.

3.5.2.  Service Protection

   Service protection allows DetNet services to increase reliability and
   maintain a DetNet Service Assurance in the case of network congestion
   or network failure.  Detnet relies on the underlying technology
   capabilities for various protection schemes.  Protection schemes
   enable partial or complete coverage of the network paths and active
   protection with combinations of PRF, PEF, and POF.

3.5.2.1.  Linear Service Protection

   An example DetNet MPLS network fragment and packet flow is
   illustrated in Figure 3.



            1      1.1       1.1      1.2.1    1.2.1      1.2.2

                              1.2.2

         Figure 3: Example Packet Flow in DetNet Protected Network

   In Figure 3 the numbers are used to identify the instance of a
   packet.  Packet 1 is the original packet, and packets 1.1, and 1.2
   are two first generation copies of packet 1.  Packet 1.2.1 is a
   second generation copy of packet 1.2, etc.  Note that these numbers
   never appear in the packet, and are not to be confused with sequence
   numbers, labels or any other identifier that appears in the packet.
   They simply indicate the generation number of the original packet so
   that its passage through the network fragment can be identified to
   the reader.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   Customer Equipment CE1 sends a packet into the DetNet enabled
   network.  This is packet (1).  Edge Node EN1 encapsulates the packet
   as a DetNet packet and sends it to Relay node R1 (packet 1.1).  EN1
   makes a copy of the packet (1.2), encapsulates it and sends this copy
   to Relay node R4.

   Note that along the path from EN1 to R1 there may be zero or more
   nodes which, for clarity, are not shown.  The same is true for any
   other path between two DetNet entities shown in Figure 3.

   Relay node R4 has been configured to send one copy of the packet to
   Relay Node R2 (packet 1.2.1) and one copy to Edge Node EN2 (packet
   1.2.2).

   R2 receives packet copy 1.2.1 before packet copy 1.1 arrives, and,
   having been configured to perform packet elimination on this DetNet
   flow, forwards packet 1.2.1 to Relay Node R3.  Packet copy 1.1 is of
   no further use and so is discarded by R2.

   Edge Node EN2 receives packet copy 1.2.2 from R4 before it receives
   packet copy 1.2.1 from R2 via relay Node R3.  EN2 therefore strips
   any DetNet encapsulation from packet copy 1.2.2 and forwards the
   packet to CE2.  When EN2 receives the later packet copy 1.2.1 this is
   discarded.

   The above is of course illustrative of many network scenarios that
   can be configured.

   This example also illustrates 1:1 protection scheme meaning there is
   traffic over each segment of the end-to-end path.  Local DetNet relay
   nodes determine which packets are eliminated and which packets are
   forwarded.  A 1+1 scheme where only one path is used for traffic at a
   time could use the same topology.  In this case there is no PRF
   function and traffic is switched upon detection of failure.  An OAM
   scheme that monitors the paths to detect the loss of path or traffic
   is required to initiate the switch.  A POF may still be used in this
   case to prevent misordering of packets.  In both cases the protection
   paths are established and maintained for the duration of the DetNet
   service.

3.5.2.2.  Path Differential Delay

   In the preceding example, proper working of duplicate elimination and
   reordering of packets are dependent on the number of out-of-order
   packets that can be buffered and the delay difference of arriving
   packets.  DetNet uses flow-specific requirements (e.g., maximum
   number of out-of-order packets, maximum latency of the flow) for
   configuration of POF-related buffers.  If the differential delay



Varga, et al.           Expires November 7, 2020               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   between paths is excessively large or there is excessive mis-ordering
   of the packets, then packets may be dropped instead of being
   reordered.  Likewise, PEF uses the sequence number to identify
   duplicate packets, and large differential delays combined with high
   numbers of packets may exceed the ability of the PEF to work
   properly.

3.5.2.3.  Ring Service Protection

   Ring protection may also be supported if the underlying technology
   supports it.  Many of the same concepts apply, however rings are
   normally 1+1 protection for data efficiency reasons.  [RFC8227] is an
   example of MPLS-TP data plane that supports Ring protection.

3.5.3.  Aggregation Considerations

   The DetNet data plane also allows for the aggregation of DetNet
   flows, which can improve scalability by reducing the per-hop state.
   How this is accomplished is data plane or control plane dependent.
   When DetNet flows are aggregated, transit nodes provide service to
   the aggregate and not on a per-DetNet flow basis.  When aggregating
   DetNet flows, the flows should be compatible, i.e., the same or very
   similar QoS and CoS characteristics.  In this case, nodes performing
   aggregation will ensure that per-flow service requirements are
   achieved.

   If bandwidth reservations are used, the reservation should be the sum
   of all the individual reservations; in other words, the reservations
   should not add up to an over-subscription of bandwidth reservation.
   If maximum delay bounds are used, the system should ensure that the
   aggregate does not exceed the delay bounds of the individual flows.

   When an encapsulation is used, the choice of reserving a maximum
   resource level and then tracking the services in the aggregated
   service or adjusting the aggregated resources as the services are
   added is implementation and technology specific.

   DetNet flows at edges must be able to handle rejection to an
   aggregation group due to lack of resources as well as conditions
   where requirements are not satisfied.

3.5.3.1.  IP Aggregation

   IP aggregation has both data plane and controller plane aspects.  For
   the data plane, flows may be aggregated for treatment based on shared
   characteristics such as 6-tuple [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  Alternatively,
   an IP encapsulation may be used to tunnel an aggregate number of
   DetNet Flows between relay nodes.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


3.5.3.2.  MPLS Aggregation

   MPLS aggregation also has data plane and controller plane aspects.
   MPLS flows are often tunneled in a forwarding sub-layer, under the
   reservation associated with that MPLS tunnel.

3.5.4.  End-System-Specific Considerations

   Data-flows requiring DetNet service are generated and terminated on
   end-systems.  Encapsulation depends on the application and its
   preferences.  For example, in a DetNet MPLS domain the sub-layer
   functions use the d-CWs, S-Labels and F-Labels to provide DetNet
   services.  However, an application may exchange further flow related
   parameters (e.g., time-stamp), which are not provided by DetNet
   functions.

   As a general rule, DetNet domains are capable of forwarding any
   DetNet flows and the DetNet domain does not mandate the end-system or
   edge node encapsulation format.  Unless there is a proxy of some form
   present, end-systems peer with similar end-systems using the same
   application encapsulation format.  For example, as shown in Figure 4,
   IP applications peer with IP applications and Ethernet applications
   peer with Ethernet applications.

3.5.5.  Sub-Network Considerations

   Any of the DetNet service types may be transported by another DetNet
   service.  MPLS nodes may be interconnected by different sub-network
   technologies, which may include point-to-point links.  Each of these
   sub-network technologies needs to provide appropriate service to
   DetNet flows.  In some cases, e.g., on dedicated point-to-point links
   or TDM technologies, all that is required is for a DetNet node to
   appropriately queue its output traffic.  In other cases, DetNet nodes
   will need to map DetNet flows to the flow semantics (i.e.,
   identifiers) and mechanisms used by an underlying sub-network
   technology.  Figure 5 shows several examples of header formats that
   can be used to carry DetNet MPLS flows over different sub-network
   technologies.  L2 represents a generic layer-2 encapsulation that
   might be used on a point-to-point link.  TSN represents the
   encapsulation used on an IEEE 802.1 TSN network, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-tsn].  UDP/IP represents the encapsulation
   used on a DetNet IP PSN, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-udp-ip].

4.  Controller Plane (Management and Control) Considerations

4.1.  DetNet Controller Plane Requirements

   The Controller Plane corresponds to the aggregation of the Control
   and Management Planes discussed in [RFC7426] and [RFC8655].  While
   more details of any DetNet controller plane are out of the scope of
   this document, there are particular considerations and requirements
   for such that result from the unique characteristics of the DetNet
   architecture and data plane as defined herein.



Varga, et al.           Expires November 7, 2020               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   The primary requirements of the DetNet controller plane are that it
   must be able to:

   o  Instantiate DetNet flows in a DetNet domain (which may include
      some or all of explicit path determination, link bandwidth
      reservations, restricting flows to IEEE 802.1 TSN links, node
      buffer and other resource reservations, specification of required
      queuing disciplines along the path, ability to manage
      bidirectional flows, etc.) as needed for a flow.

   o  In the case of MPLS, manage DetNet S-Label and F-Label allocation
      and distribution, where the DetNet MPLS encapsulation is in use
      see [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

   o  Support DetNet flow aggregation.

   o  Advertise static and dynamic node and link resources such as
      capabilities and adjacencies to other network nodes (for dynamic
      signaling approaches) or to network controllers (for centralized
      approaches).

   o  Scale to handle the number of DetNet flows expected in a domain
      (which may require per-flow signaling or provisioning).

   o  Provision flow identification information at each of the nodes
      along the path.  Flow identification may differ depending on the
      location in the network and the DetNet functionality (e.g. transit
      node vs. relay node).

   These requirements, as stated earlier, could be satisfied using
   distributed control protocol signaling (such as RSVP-TE), centralized
   network management provisioning mechanisms (such as BGP, PCEP, YANG
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model], etc.) or hybrid
   combinations of the two, and could also make use of MPLS-based
   segment routing.

   In the abstract, the results of either distributed signaling or
   centralized provisioning are equivalent from a DetNet data plane
   perspective - flows are instantiated, explicit routes are determined,
   resources are reserved, and packets are forwarded through the domain
   using the DetNet data plane.

   However, from a practical and implementation standpoint, controller
   plane alternatives are not equivalent at all.  Some approaches are
   more scalable than others in terms of signaling load on the network.
   Some alternatives can take advantage of global tracking of resources
   in the DetNet domain for better overall network resource
   optimization.  Some solutions are more resilient than others if link,

   node, or management equipment failures occur.  While a detailed
   analysis of the control plane alternatives is out of the scope of
   this document, the requirements from this document can be used as the
   basis of a later analysis of the alternatives.

4.2.  Generic Controller Plane Considerations

   This section covers control plane considerations that are independent
   of the data plane technology used for DetNet service delivery.

   While the management plane and control planes are traditionally
   considered separately, from the data plane perspective there is no
   practical difference based on the origin of flow provisioning
   information, and the DetNet architecture [RFC8655] refers to these
   collectively as the 'Controller Plane'.  This document therefore does
   not distinguish between information provided by distributed control
   plane protocols, e.g., RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473], or by
   centralized network management mechanisms, e.g., RestConf [RFC8040],
   YANG [RFC7950], and the Path Computation Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] or
   any combination thereof.  Specific considerations and requirements
   for the DetNet Controller Plane are discussed in Section 4.1.

   Each respective data plane document also covers the control plane
   considerations for that technology.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] covers IP control plane normative considerations
   and [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] covers MPLS control plane normative
   considerations.

4.2.1.  Flow Aggregation Control

   Flow aggregation means that multiple app-flows are served by a single
   new DetNet flow.  There are many techniques to achieve aggregation.
   For example, in the case of IP, IP flows that share 6-tuple
   attributes or flow identifiers at the DetNet sub-layer can be
   grouped.  Another example includes aggregation accomplished through
   the use of hierarchical LSPs in MPLS and tunnels.

   Control of aggregation involves a set of procedures listed here.
   Aggregation may use some or all of these capabilities and the order
   may vary:

   o  Traffic engineering resource collection and distribution:

         Available resources are tracked through control plane or
         management plane databases and distributed amongst controllers
         or nodes that can manage resources.




Varga, et al.           Expires November 7, 2020               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   o  Path computation and resource allocation:

         When DetNet services are provisioned or requested, one or more
         paths meeting the requirements are selected and the resources
         verified and recorded.

   o  Resource assignment and data plane co-ordination:

         The assignment of resources along the path depends on the
         technology and includes assignment of specific links,
         coordination of queueing, and other traffic management
         capabilities such as policing and shaping.

   o  Assigned Resource recording and updating:

         Depending on the specific technology, the assigned resources
         are updated and distributed in the databases, preventing over-
         subscription.

4.2.2.  Explicit Routes

   Explicit routes are used to ensure that packets are routed through
   the resources that have been reserved for them, and hence provide the
   DetNet application with the required service.  A requirement for the
   DetNet Controller Plane will be the ability to assign a particular
   identified DetNet IP flow to a path through the DetNet domain that
   has been assigned the required per-node resources.  This provides the
   appropriate traffic treatment for the flow and also includes
   particular links as a part of the path that are able to support the
   DetNet flow.  For example, by using IEEE 802.1 TSN links (as
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-tsn] ) DetNet parameters can
   be maintained.  Further considerations and requirements for the
   DetNet Controller Plane are discussed in Section 4.1.

   Whether configuring, calculating and instantiating these routes is a
   single-stage or multi-stage process, or in a centralized or
   distributed manner, is out of scope of this document.

   There are several approaches that could be used to provide explicit
   routes and resource allocation in the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.
   For example:

   o  The path could be explicitly set up by a controller which
      calculates the path and explicitly configures each node along that
      path with the appropriate forwarding and resource allocation
      information.





Varga, et al.           Expires November 7, 2020               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   o  The path could use a distributed control plane such as RSVP
      [RFC2205] or RSVP-TE [RFC3473] extended to support DetNet IP
      flows.

   o  The path could be implemented using IPv6-based segment routing
      when extended to support resource allocation.

   See Section 4.1 for further discussion of these alternatives.  In
   addition, [RFC2386] contains useful background information on QoS-
   based routing, and [RFC5575] (being updated by
   [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis]) discusses a specific mechanism used by BGP
   for traffic flow specification and policy-based routing.

4.2.3.  Contention Loss and Jitter Reduction

   As discussed in Section 1, this document does not specify the
   mechanisms needed to eliminate packet contention, packet loss or
   reduce jitter for DetNet flows at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.
   The ability to manage node and link resources to be able to provide
   these functions is a necessary part of the DetNet controller plane.
   It is also necessary to be able to control the required queuing
   mechanisms used to provide these functions along a flow's path
   through the network.  See [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] and Section 4.1 for
   further discussion of these requirements.  Some forms of protection
   may minimize packet loss or change jitter characteristics in the
   cases where packets are reordered when out-of-order packets are
   received at the service sub-layer.

4.2.4.  Bidirectional Traffic

   In many cases DetNet flows can be considered unidirectional and
   independent.  However, there are cases where the DetNet service
   requires bidirectional traffic from a DetNet application service
   perspective.  IP and MPLS typically treat each direction separately
   and do not force interdependence of each direction.  MPLS has
   considered bidirectional traffic requirements and the MPLS
   definitions from [RFC5654] are useful to illustrate terms such as
   associated bidirectional flows and co-routed bidirectional flows.
   MPLS defines a point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP as
   consisting of two unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one from A to B
   and the other from B to A, which are regarded as providing a single
   logical bidirectional forwarding path.  This is analogous to standard
   IP routing.  MPLS defines a point-to-point co-routed bidirectional
   LSP as an associated bidirectional LSP which satisfies the additional
   constraint that its two unidirectional component LSPs follow the same
   path (in terms of both nodes and links) in both directions.  An
   important property of co-routed bidirectional LSPs is that their
   unidirectional component LSPs share fate.  In both types of

   bidirectional LSPs, resource reservations may differ in each
   direction.  The concepts of associated bidirectional flows and co-
   routed bidirectional flows can also be applied to DetNet IP flows.

   While the DetNet IP data plane must support bidirectional DetNet
   flows, there are no special bidirectional features with respect to
   the data plane other than the need for the two directions of a co-
   routed bidirectional flow to take the same path.  That is to say that
   bidirectional DetNet flows are solely represented at the management
   and control plane levels, without specific support or knowledge
   within the DetNet data plane.  Fate sharing and associated or co-
   routed bidirectional flows, can be managed at the control level.

   DetNet's use of PREOF may increase the complexity of using co-routing
   bidirectional flows, since if PREOF is used, then the replication
   points in one direction would have to match the elimination points in
   the other direction, and vice versa.  In such cases the optimal
   points for these functions in one direction may not match the optimal
   points in the other, due to network and traffic constraints.
   Furthermore, due to the per packet service protection nature,
   bidirectional forwarding per packet may not be ensured.  The first
   packet of received member flows is selected by the elimination
   function independently of which path it has taken through the
   network.

   Control and management mechanisms need to support bidirectional
   flows, but the specification of such mechanisms are out of scope of
   this document.  Example control plane solutions for MPLS can be found
   in [RFC3473] , [RFC6387] and [RFC7551].  These requirements are
   included in Section 4.1.

4.3.  Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering (PREOF)

   The controller plane protocol solution required for managing the
   PREOF processing is outside the scope of this document.  That said,
   it should be noted that the ability to determine, for a particular
   flow, optimal packet replication and elimination points in the DetNet
   domain requires explicit support.  There may be existing capabilities
   that can be used, or extended, for example GMPLS end-to-end recovery
   [RFC4872] and GMPLS segment recovery [RFC4873].

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-security].  General security considerations for
   DetNet architecture are described in [RFC8655].  This section
   considers architecture-level DetNet security considerations
   applicable to all data planes.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2020


   Part of what makes DetNet unique is its ability to provide specific
   and reliable quality of service (delivering data flows with extremely
   low packet loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery latency), and
   the security-related aspects of protecting that quality of service
   are similarly unique.

   As for all communications protocols, the primary consideration for
   the data plane is to maintain integrity of data and delivery of the
   associated DetNet service traversing the DetNet network.  Application
   flows can be protected through whatever means is provided by the
   underlying technology.  For example, encryption may be used, such as
   that provided by IPSec [RFC4301] for IP flows and/or by an underlying
   sub-net using MACSec [IEEE802.1AE-2018] for Ethernet (Layer-2) flows.

   At the management and control level DetNet flows are identified on a
   per-flow basis, which may provide controller plane attackers with
   additional information about the data flows (when compared to
   controller planes that do not include per-flow identification).  This
   is an inherent property of DetNet which has security implications
   that should be considered when determining if DetNet is a suitable
   technology for any given use case.

   To provide uninterrupted availability of the DetNet service,
   provisions can be made against DOS attacks and delay attacks.  To
   protect against DOS attacks, excess traffic due to malicious or
   malfunctioning devices can be prevented or mitigated, for example
   through the use of existing mechanisms such as policing and shaping
   applied at the input of a DetNet domain.  To prevent DetNet packets
   from being delayed by an entity external to a DetNet domain, DetNet
   technology definition can allow for the mitigation of Man-In-The-
   Middle attacks, for example through use of authentication and
   authorization of devices within the DetNet domain.

   In order to prevent or mitigate DetNet attacks on other networks via
   flow escape, edge devices can for example use existing mechanism such
   as policing and shaping applied at the output of a DetNet domain.
