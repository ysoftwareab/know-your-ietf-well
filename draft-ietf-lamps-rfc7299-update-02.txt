  Update to the Object Identifier Registry for the PKIX Working Group
                   draft-ietf-lamps-rfc7299-update-02

Abstract

   RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers that were assigned by
   Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group in an arc
   that was allocated by IANA (1.3.6.1.5.5.7).  A small number of object
   identifiers that were assigned in RFC 4212 are omitted from RFC 7299,
   and this document updates RFC 7299 to correct that oversight.

1.  Introduction

   When the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group
   was chartered, an object identifier arc was allocated by IANA for use
   by that working group.  After the PKIX Working Group was closed,
   [RFC7299] was published to describe the object identifiers that were
   assigned in that arc.  A small number of object identifiers that were
   assigned in RFC 4212 [RFC4212] are not included in RFC 7299, and this
   document corrects that oversight.

   The PKIX Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [RFC4210] allocated
   id-regCtrl-altCertTemplate (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.5.1.7), and then two object
   identifiers were assigned within that arc [RFC4212], which were
   intended to be used with either PKIX CMP [RFC4210] or PKIX
   Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) [RFC5272] [RFC5273] [RFC5274]
   [RFC6402].

   This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in
   that arc, established an IANA registry for that arc, and establishes
   IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that arc.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create one additional registry table.

2.1.  "SMI Security for PKIX CRMF Registration Controls for Alternate
      Certificate Formats" Registry

   Within the SMI-numbers registry, an "SMI Security for PKIX CRMF
   Registration Controls for Alternate Certificate Formats
   (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.5.1.7)" table with three columns has been added:

         Decimal  Description                     References
         -------  ------------------------------  ----------
         1        id-acTemplate                   [RFC4212]
         2        id-openPGPCertTemplateExt       [RFC4212]

Internet-Draft     CRMF Algorithm Requirements Update       October 2021


   Future updates to the registry table are to be made according to the
   Specification Required policy as defined in [RFC8126].  The expert is
   expected to ensure that any new values are strongly related to the
   work that was done by the PKIX Working Group.  In particular,
   additional object identifiers should be needed for use with either
   the PKIX CMP or PKIX CMC to support alternative certificate formats.
   Object identifiers for other purposes should not be assigned in this
   arc.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new
   security considerations.  The protocols that specify these values
   include the security considerations associated with their usage.
