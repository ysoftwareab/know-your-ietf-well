   This document was written to provide "best practice" guidance and 
   recommendations to developers building X.509 public-key certification 
   paths within their applications.  By following the guidance and 
   recommendations defined in this document, an application developer is 
   more likely to develop a robust X.509 certificate enabled application 
   that can build valid certification paths across a wide range of PKI 
   environments.

1.   Introduction 
    
   X.509 digital certificates have become an accepted method for 
   securely binding the identity of an individual or device to a public 
   key, for the purpose of supporting public key cryptographic 
   operations such as digital signature verification, and public key-
   based encryption and decryption.  However, prior to using the public 
   key contained in a digital certificate, an application must first 
   determine the authenticity of that digital certificate, and 
   specifically, the validity of all the certificates leading to a 
   trusted root certificate.  It is through validating this certificate 
   path that the assertion of the binding made between the identity and 
   the public key in each of the digital certificate can be traced back 
   to a single point of trust. 
    
   The process by which an application determines this authenticity of a 
   digital certificate, and ostensibly the trust that application will 
   place in the use of that digital certificate, is called certification 
   path processing.  Certification path processing establishes a chain 
   of trust between a trusted public key and a digital certificate.  
   This chain of trust is composed of a series of digital certificates, 
   known as a certification path.  A certification path begins with a 
   certificate whose signature can be verified using a trusted public

   key and ends with the target digital certificate.  Path processing 
   entails building and validating the certification path to determine 
   the degree of trust to place in the target digital certificate. 
    
1.1    Motivation 
    
   Many other documents (such as [RFC 3280]) cover certification path 
   validation requirements and procedures in detail but do not discuss 
   the intricacies of certification path building. This document 
   therefore is an effort to provide useful and practical guidance in 
   that area.  
    
   This document is an informational Internet-Draft that seeks to 
   provide "best-practices" for certification path building.  It is 
   intended to provide information; there are no requirements or 
   specifications in this document.  Furthermore, rather than suggesting 
   "the" way to best perform certificate path building, this document 
   seeks to draw upon first hand experience to offer insights and 
   recommendations to developers integrating support for X.509 digital 
   certificates into their applications. 
    
   In addition, this document suggests an effective general approach to 
   path building that involves a depth first tree traversal.  While the 
   authors believe this approach offers the balance of simplicity in 
   design and development with very effective and infrastructure neutral 
   path building capabilities, the algorithm is no more than a suggested 
   approach. Other approaches (e.g., building complete spanning trees of 
   the PKI.) exist and may be shown to be more effective under certain 
   conditions.  Certification path validation is described in detail in 
   both [X.509] and [RFC 3280] and is not repeated in this document. 
    
1.2    Terminology 
    
   Terms used throughout this document will be used in the following 
   ways: 
    
   Certificate:  A digital binding that cannot be counterfeited between 
   a named entity and a public key. 
    
   Certificate Graph:  A graph that represents the entire PKI (or all 
   cross-certified PKIs) where all named entities are viewed as nodes 
   and all certificates are viewed as lines between nodes. 
    
   Certificate Processing System:  An application or device that 
   performs the functions of certification path building and 
   certification path validation.

   Certification Path:  An ordered list of certificates starting with a 
   certificate signed by a trusted public key and ending with the target 
   certificate. (Sometimes referred to as a Certificate Chain.) 
    
   Certification Authority (CA):  An entity that issues and manages 
   digital certificates. 
    
   Certification Path Building:  The process used to obtain the 
   certification path between the trusted root and the target 
   certificate.  (This is also sometimes referred to as Certification 
   Path Construction, Certification Path Development, or Certification 
   Path Discovery.) 
    
   Certification Path Validation:  The process that verifies the binding 
   between the subject and the subject-public-key defined in the target 
   certificate, using a trusted public key and set of known constraints. 
    
   Cross-Certificate:  A certificate issued by one CA to another CA for 
   the purpose of establishing a trust relationship between the two CAs. 
    
   Cross-Certification:  The act of issuing cross-certificates. 
   Local PKI or Local Realm:  The set of PKI components and data 
   (certificates, directories, CRLs, etc.) that are created and used by 
   the certificate using organization.  In general, this concept refers 
   to the components that are in close proximity to the certificate 
   using application. The assumption is that the local data is more 
   easily accessible and/or inexpensive to retrieve than non-local PKI 
   data. 
    
   Directory:  Generally used to refer an LDAP accessible repository for 
   certificates and PKI information. The term may also be used 
   generically to refer to any certificate storing repository. 
    
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):  The set of hardware, software, 
   personnel, policy, and procedures used by a Certification Authority 
   to issue and manage certificates. 
    
   Relying Party (RP):  An application or entity that processes 
   certificates for the purpose of 1) verifying a digital signature, 2) 
   authenticating another entity, or 3) establishing confidential 
   communications. 
    
   Subscriber:  The holder of a private key and corresponding 
   certificate, and whose identity is defined as the Subject of the 
   certificate. 
    
   Target Certificate:  The certificate that is to be validated by a 
   relying party. It is the "Certificate targeted for validation."

   Although frequently this is the End Entity or a leaf node in the PKI 
   structure, this could also be a CA certificate if a CA certificate is 
   being validated, e.g., for the purpose of building and validating 
   certification path for verifying signature on CRL.  
    
   Trusted Root Certificate:  A certificate that contains a trusted 
   public key and is used in certification path processing. 
    
1.3     Overview of PKI Structures 
    
   When verifying X.509 public key certificates, often times the 
   application performing the verification has no knowledge of the 
   underlying Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that issued the 
   certificate.  PKI structures can range from very simple, hierarchical 
   structures to complex structures such as multi-bridged, or mesh 
   structures.  These structures define the types of certification paths 
   that must be constructed and validated by an application.  This 
   section describes four well-known PKI structures. 
    
1.3.1 Hierarchical Structures 
    
   A hierarchical PKI, depicted in Figure 1, is one in which all of the 
   subscribers and relying parties trust a single "root" CA.  If the 
   hierarchy has multiple levels, the root CA certifies the public keys 
   of intermediate CAs (also known as subordinate CAs).  These CAs then 
   certify end entitiesÆ (subscribersÆ) public keys or may, in a large 
   PKI, certify other CAs.  In this architecture, certificates are 
   issued in only one direction, and a CA never certifies another CA 
   "superior" to itself. Typically, only one superior CA certifies each 
   CA.

                  Figure 1 û Sample Hierarchical PKI 
    
   Certification path building in a hierarchical PKI is a 
   straightforward process that simply requires the relying party to 
   successively retrieve issuer certificates until a certificate is 
   located that was issued by the trusted root. 
    
   A widely used variation on the single-rooted hierarchical PKI is the 
   inclusion of multiple CAs as trusted roots.  [See Figure 2.]  Here, 
   end entity certificates are validated using the same approach as with 
   any hierarchical PKI . The difference is that a certificate will be 
   accepted if it can be verified back to any of the set of trusted 
   roots.  Popular web browsers use this approach, and are shipped with 
   trusted CA lists containing dozens to more than one hundred CAs.  
   While this approach simplifies the implementation of a limited form 
   of certificate verification, it also may introduce certain security 
   vulnerabilities.  For example, the user may have little or no idea of 
   the policies or operating practices of the various roots, and may not 
   be aware of which root was used to verify a given certificate.  
   Conversely, if the trusted CA list is properly managed and kept to a 
   manageable size, it can be an efficient solution to building and 
   validating certification paths.

   In a typical mesh style PKI (depicted in Figure 3), each subscriber 
   trusts the CA that issued their own certificate(s).  The CAs in this 
   environment have a peer relationship and are neither superior nor 
   subordinate to each other.  In a mesh, CAs in the PKI cross-certify. 
   That is, each CA issues a certificate to, and is issued a certificate 
   by, peer CAs in the PKI. The figure depicts a mesh PKI that is fully 
   cross-certified (sometimes called a full mesh); however it is 
   possible to architect and deploy a mesh PKI with a mixture of 
   unidirectional and bi-directional cross-certifications (called a 
   partial mesh).

   Certification path building in a mesh PKI is more complex than in a 
   hierarchical PKI due to the likely existence of multiple paths 
   between a relying partyÆs trust anchor and the certificate to be 
   verified.  These multiple paths increase the potential for creating 
   "loops", "dead ends", or invalid paths while building the

1.3.3 Bi-lateral Cross-Certified Structures 
    
   PKIs can be connected via cross-certification to enable the relying 
   parties of each to verify and accept certificates issued by the other 
   PKI.  If the PKIs are hierarchical, cross-certification will 
   typically be accomplished by each root CA issuing a certificate for 
   the other PKIÆs root CA.  This results in a slightly more complex, 
   but still essentially hierarchical environment.  If the PKIs are mesh 
   style, then a CA within each PKI is selected, more or less 
   arbitrarily, to establish the cross-certification, effectively 
   creating a larger mesh PKI.  Figure 4 depicts a hybrid situation 
   resulting from a hierarchical PKI cross-certifying with a mesh PKI.

   In current implementations, this situation creates a concern that the 
   applications used under the hierarchical PKIs will not have path 
   building capabilities robust enough to handle this more complex 
   certificate graph.  As the number of cross-certified PKIs grows, the 
   number of the relationships between them grows exponentially.  Two 
   principal concerns about cross-certification are the creation of 
   unintended trust paths through transitive trust, and the dilution of 
   assurance when a high-assurance PKI with restrictive operating 
   policies is cross-certified with a PKI with less restrictive 
   policies. 
    
1.3.4 Bridge Structures 
    
   Another approach to the interconnection of PKIs is the use of a 
   "bridge" certification authority (BCA).  A BCA is a nexus to 
   establish trust paths among multiple PKIs.  The BCA cross-certifies 
   with one CA (known as a "principal" CA [PCA]) in each participating 
   PKI.  Since each PKI only cross-certifies with one other CA (i.e., 
   the BCA), and the BCA cross-certifies only once with each 
   participating PKI, the number of cross certification relationships in 
   the bridged environment grows linearly with the number of PKIs, 
   whereas the number of cross certification relationships in mesh 
   architectures grows exponentially (n**2).  However, when connecting 
   PKIs in this way, the number and variety of PKIs involved results in 
   a non-hierarchical environment, such as the one as depicted in Figure 
   5.

1.4     Bridge Structures and Certification Path Processing 
    
   A developer building a certificate-enabled application intended for 
   widespread use throughout various industrial sectors should consider 
   supporting a Bridge PKI structure because 1) Bridge PKI structures 
   are becoming widely accepted as a way of interconnecting PKIs to 
   achieve large-scale interoperability, and 2) implementation of 
   certification path processing functions to support a Bridge PKI 
   structure will support all other PKI structures.  (e.g., 
   hierarchical, mesh, hybrid)  This is true because a Bridge PKI 
   environment can potentially connect any or all of the PKI structures. 
   An application that can successfully construct valid certification 
   paths in all Bridge PKIs will have by default implemented all of the 
   processing logic required to support the less diverse PKI structures.   
   As a result, a PKI-enabled application that fully supports the Bridge 
   PKI structure can be deployed in any standards compliant PKI 
   environment and should perform the required certification path 
   processing properly. 
    
2.   Certification Path Building 
    
   Certification path building is the process by which the certificate 
   processing system obtains the certification path between a trusted 
   public key and the target certificate.  Different implementations can 
   build the certification path in different ways; therefore, it is not 
   the intent of this paper to recommend a single "best" way to perform 
   this function.  Rather, guidance is provided on the technical issues 
   that surround the path building process, and the capabilities a path 
   building implementation must have in order to build certification 
   paths successfully, irrespective of PKI structures. 
    
2.1     Introduction to Certification Path Building

   A certification path is an ordered list of certificates starting with 
   a certificate that can be validated by one of the relying partyÆs 
   trusted public keys, and ending with the certificate to be validated.  
   (The certificate to be validated is referred to as the "target 
   certificate" throughout this document.)  Though not required, as a 
   matter of convenience these trusted public keys are typically placed 
   in their own self signed certificates and are frequently called 
   trusted root certificates.  The intermediate certificates that 
   comprise the certification path may be retrieved by any means 
   available to the validating application.  These sources may include 
   LDAP, HTTP, SQL, a local cache or certificate store, or as part of 
   the security protocol itself as is common practice with signed S/MIME 
   messages.  
    
   Figure 6 shows an example of a certification path.  In this figure, 
   the arrows represent certificates.

      +---------+  |   +-----+  |  +-----+  |  +-----+  |  +--------+

                   |            |           |           |

                Figure 6 û Example Certification Path 
    
   Unlike certification path validation, certification path building is 
   not addressed by the standards that define the semantics and 
   structure of a PKI.  However, the ability to construct or build a 
   valid certification path is of paramount importance for applications 
   that rely on a PKI.  Absent valid certification paths, the trust that 
   underpins the infrastructure is also absent, effectively rendering 
   the PKI useless.  So, the ability to build a path is every bit as 
   important as the ability to properly validate them. 
    
   There are many issues that can complicate the path building process. 
   For example, building a path through a cross-certified environment 
   could require the path-building module to traverse multiple PKI 
   domains spanning multiple directories, using multiple algorithms, and 
   employing varying key lengths.  A path-building client may also, for 
   example, need to manage a number of trusted root certificates, 
   partially populated directory entries (e.g., missing forward cross 
   certificates.), parsing of certain certificate extensions (e.g., 
   authorityInformationAccess) and directory attributes

   (e.g.,crossCertificatePair), and error handling such as loop 
   detection. 
    
   In addition, a developer must also decide whether to construct paths 
   from a trusted root (the reverse direction) to the target certificate 
   or from the target certificate (the forward direction) to a trusted 
   root. Some implementations may decide to use both.  The choice a 
   developer makes should be dependant on the environment and the 
   underlying PKI for that environment.  For example, if the 
   infrastructure is compliant with the Internet X.509 Public Key 
   Infrastructure LDAPv2 Schema (RFC 2587), a developer can build 
   certification paths in the forward (from target) direction.  However, 
   not all PKIs are compliant with RFC2587.  An infrastructure may not 
   populate the forward cross-certificates and instead only populate the 
   reverse (fromThisCA) entries, in which case building in reverse will 
   be a developerÆs only viable option.  Note that a PKI that does 
   comply with RFC2587 may or may not populate the reverse (fromThisCA) 
   entry; so building in reverse may or may not work in compliant 
   systems. 
    
2.2    Path Building Algorithms 
    
   It is intuitive for people familiar with the Bridge CA concept or 
   mesh type PKIs to view path building as traversing a complex graph.  
   However, from the simplest viewpoint, writing a path-building module 
   can be nothing more than a simple tree traversal.  In fact, even in a 
   very complex cross-certified environment, it can still be a tree 
   traversal.  Complex environments can be traversed using spanning tree 
   algorithm, much like simple hierarchal PKIs, because there is little 
   benefit derived from revisiting a node (X.509 has a similar 
   requirement for not including the same certificate in a certification 
   path more than once).  Figure 7 below illustrates this concept from 
   the trusted rootÆs perspective.

     Figure 7 û Simple Certificate Graph û From Root Tree Depiction 
    
   When viewed from this perspective, all PKIs look like hierarchies 
   emanating from the trusted root at the leaves of the tree.  An 
   infrastructure can be depicted in this way regardless of how complex 
   it is û this greatly simplifies software design.  In Figure 8, the 
   same graph is depicted from the end entity (EE) (the target 
   certificate in this example) perspective.  It would appear this way 
   if building in the forward (from EE or from target) direction.  In 
   this example, without knowing any particulars of the certificates, it 
   appears at first that building from EE has a smaller decision tree 
   than building from the trusted root.  While it is true that there are 
   fewer nodes in the tree, it is not necessarily any more efficient.

                 The same certificate graph rendered 
                  as a tree but from the end entity 
                    rather than the trusted root. 
    
     Figure 8 û Certificate Graph û From Target Certificate Depiction 
    
   Suppose a path building algorithm performed no optimizations û that 
   is, it is only capable of detecting that the current node (position 
   in the tree) was issued by the trusted root, or that it issued the 
   target certifcate (EE).  From the tree above, building from the 
   target certificate will require going through two intermediate 
   certificates before encountering a certificate issued by the trusted 
   root 100% of the time (e.g., EE chains to B, which then chains to C, 
   which is issued by the TR).  The path building module would not chain 
   C to A because it can recognize that C has a certificate issued by 
   the TR. 
    
   On the other hand, in the first tree (Figure 7: from root depiction), 
   there is a 50% probability of building a path longer than needed 
   (e.g., TR to A to C to B to EE rather than the shorter TR to A to B 
   to EE).  However, even given our simplistic example, the path 
   building software û when at A û could be designed to recognize that 
   B's subject distinguished name matches the issuer distinguished name 
   of the EE.  Given this one optimization, the builder could use B in 
   preference to C.  (BÆs subject distinguished name matches that of the 
   EEÆs issuer whereas CÆs subject distinguished name does not.)  So, 
   for this example, assuming the reverse (fromThisCA) and forward 
   (toThisCA) elements were fully populated in the directory and our 
   path building module implemented the aforementioned distinguished

   name matching optimization method, path building from either the root 
   or the target certificate could be made roughly equivalent.  A list 
   of possible optimization methods is provided later in this document. 
    
   What about more complicated examples?  What about an environment 
   where more than one root is trusted?  The number of trusted roots 
   should weigh heavily upon the decision to build in the reverse 
   direction.  If, for sake of argument, it required a fixed amount of 
   network access to build all the possible paths either to or from a 
   given CA, what should be expected if there are four trusted root CAs? 
   Suppose that building paths either from the target certificate or 
   from the root for any given root or target certificate will require N 
   time.  In the from root (reverse) direction, the path building 
   software potentially needs to build paths from all 4 trusted CAs, so 
   as much as 4*N.  Assuming a path exists, and if N were 10 seconds, 
   one would expect an average delay of 20 (4*10 / 2) seconds when 
   building from the root. In the from target certificate (forward) 
   direction (and using the same example), path building software would 
   only require 10 (1*N) seconds, only 40% of the average time required 
   when building from the root.  As the number of trusted roots 
   increases, so does the average time it takes to find a path if one 
   does exist.  In the degenerate case where no path exists, attempting 
   to build from the same four trusted roots should consume 40 seconds, 
   whereas building from the end entity would consume at most 10 
   seconds.

               Building from the target certificate eliminates 
            inapplicable PKIs (those that are not cross certified 
            with the required one) from the path building process. 
    
           Figure 9 û Reverse and Forward Path Building 
                         with Multiple Trust Roots 
    
   As Figure 9 depicts, when multiple trusted roots are present, it can 
   be many times more efficient to build certification paths starting 
   from the target certificate.  As the number of roots increases, so 
   does the inefficiency of building paths from the trusted roots.  As a 
   result, any certificate using system supporting multiple trusted CAs 
   should consider developing paths in the forward (from target 
   certificate) direction. 
    
   Irrespective of the path building approach for any path-building 
   algorithm, cases can be constructed that make the algorithm perform 
   poorly.  The following questions should help a developer decide from 
   which direction to build certification paths for a particular 
   environment: 
    
   1) What is required to accommodate the local PKI environment?

        A) Is the directory RFC2587 compliant (Specifically, are the 
          forward [IssuedtoThisCA] cross-certificates or the 
          cACertificate attribute populated in the directory)?  If yes, 
          you are able to build in the forward direction. 
        B) Does the directory contain all the optional reverse cross 
          certificates (IssuedByThisCA) in the crossCertificatePair 
          attribute?  If yes, it is possible to build in the reverse 
          direction. 
   2) What PKI environments must be interoperated with? 
        A) Are the other directories RFC2587 compliant?  If yes, it is 
          possible to build in the forward direction. 
        B) Do the directories contain all the optional reverse cross 
          certificates (IssuedByThisCA) in the crossCertificatePair 
          attribute?  If yes, it is possible to build in the reverse 
          direction. 
   3) How many root certificates (or keys) will be trusted by the path 
      building and validation software? 
        A) Are there (or will there be) multiple trusted roots in the 
          local PKI?  If yes, forward path building may offer better 
          performance. 
        B) Will all the PKIs that the path building and validation 
          software needs to deal with, populate IssedByThisCA element 
          fully (i.e., for all CA certificates) for all CA nodes?  If 
          yes, only then reverse path building is an option. 
    
2.3     How to Build a Certification Path 
    
   As it was discussed in the prior section, path building is 
   essentially a tree traversal.  It was easy to see how this is true in 
   a simple example, but how about a more complicated one? Before taking 
   a look at a complicated scenario, it is worthwhile to address loops 
   and what constitutes a loop in a certification path.  X.509 specifies 
   that the same certificate may not repeat in a path.  In a strict 
   sense, this works well as it is not possible to create an endless 
   loop without repeating one or more certificates in the path.  
   However, this requirement fails to adequately address Bridge CA 
   environments.

                   Figure 10 û Four Bridged PKIs 
    
   Figure 10 depicts four root certification authorities cross-certified 
   with a Bridge CA (BCA).  By building certification paths through the 
   BCA, trust can be extended across the four infrastructures.  When 
   looking at Figure 10, note that the boxes do not represent 
   certificates, but rather entities (i.e., Distinguished Name or DN). 
   The certificates are represented by the arrows between the entities 
   in the boxes.  Thus, the BCA has four certificates issued to it; one 
   issued from each of the trust roots in the graph.  If a directory 
   system is used to store certificates in the Bridge CAs directory 
   entry, the four certificates issued to the BCA would be stored in the 
   forward (or "toThisCA") entry of four different crossCertificatePair 
   structures.  The BCA also has issued four certificates, one to each

   of the trust roots.  If stored in the BCA directory system, those 
   certificates would be stored in the reverse or (or "fromThisCA") 
   entry of the same four crossCertificatePair structures.  The four 
   CertificatePair structures would then be stored in the BCA's 
   directory entry in the crossCertificatePair attribute. 
    
   When building paths, a developer must make certain not to repeat 
   certificates in order to comply with X.509.  For instance, from the 
   figure above, do not build the path E->B->C->A->C->A->Y.  Not only is 
   the repetition unnecessary to build the path from E to Y, but it also 
   requires the reuse of a certificate (the one issued from C to A), 
   which is non-compliant with X.509. 
    
   What about the following path from EE to TR Z? 
    
                    EE->N->L->X->BCA->W->BCA->Y->BCA->Z 
    
   Unlike the first example, this path does not require a developer to 
   repeat any certificates û therefore, it is compliant with X.509.  
   Each of the BCA certificates is issued from a different source and is 
   therefore a different certificate.  Suppose now that the bottom left 
   PKI (in Figure 10) had double arrows between Y and C, as well as 
   between Y and A. The following path could then be constructed: 
    
               EE->N->L->X->BCA->W->BCA->Y->C->A->Y->BCA->Z 
    
   A path such as this could become arbitrarily complex and traverse 
   every cross certified CA in every PKI in a cross-certified 
   environment while still remaining compliant with X.509.  As a 
   practical matter, the path above is not something an application 
   would typically want, nor should it be necessary, to construct for a 
   variety of reasons:  
    
      - First, certification paths like the example above are generally 
        not intended by the PKI designers and should not be necessary 
        in order to validate any given certificate.  If a convoluted 
        path such as the example above is required (there is no 
        corresponding simple path) in order to validate a given 
        certificate, this is most likely indicative of a flaw in the 
        PKI design.  In other words, consumption of such paths by 
        relying parties could potentially yield trust in unintended 
        ways. 
         
      - Second, the longer a path becomes, the greater the potential 
        dilution of trust in the certification path.  That is, with 
        each successive link in the infrastructure (i.e., certification 
        by CAs and cross-certification between CAs) some amount of

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
        assurance may be considered lost. 
         
      - Third, the longer and more complicated a path, the less likely 
        it is to validate because of policy, name constraints, CRL 
        availability, or even revocation. 
         
      - Lastly, and certainly not least important from a developer's or 
        application user's perspective, is performance.  Allowing paths 
        like the one above dramatically increases the number of 
        possible paths for every certificate in a mesh or cross-
        certified environment.  Every path built may require one or 
        more of the following:  validation, CPU intensive signature 
        validations, CRL retrievals, increased network load, and local 
        memory caching.  Eliminating the superfluous paths can greatly 
        improve performance û especially in the case where no path 
        exists. 
    
   How can these superfluous paths be eliminated?  Rather than only 
   disallowing identical certificates from repeating, it is recommended 
   that a developer disallow the same public key and subject name pair 
   from being repeated.  For maximum flexibility, the subject name 
   should collectively include any subject alternative names.  Using 
   this rule, all of the intended and needed paths should be available, 
   and the excess and diluted paths should be eliminated.  For example, 
   using this rule, only one path exists from the EE to Z in the diagram 
   above: EE->N->L->X->BCA->Z. 
    
   Given the simplifying rule of not repeating pairs of subject names 
   (including subject alternative names) and public keys, and only using 
   certificates found in the cACertificate and forward (IssuedtoThisCA) 
   element of the crossCertificatePair attributes, Figure 11 depicts all 
   the possible paths from the EE to all reachable nodes in the graph.  
   This is the ideal graph for a path builder attempting to build a path 
   from EE to Z.

       Figure 11 û Forward (From Entity) Decision Tree 
    
   It is not possible to build paths into the infrastructures behind CAs 
   W, Y, and Z, because the other CA certificates (A, C, F, G, O, and P 
   shown in Figure 10) can only be found in the reverse (IssuedByThisCA) 
   element of the crossCertificatePair.  If simplicity and speed is 
   desirable, the graph in Figure 11 is a very appealing way to 
   structure the path-building algorithm.  Finding a path from the EE to 
   one of the four trusted roots is reasonably simple.  Alternately, a 
   developer could choose to build in the opposite direction, using the 
   reverse cross-certificates from any one of the four trusted roots 
   around the BCA.  The graph in Figure 12 depicts all possible paths as 
   a tree emanating from Z.

   Given the relative complexity of this decision tree, it becomes clear 
   that making the right choices while navigating the tree can make a 
   large difference in how quickly a path is returned.  The path 
   building software could potentially traverse the entire graph before 
   choosing the shortest path:  Z->BCA->X->L->N->EE.  With a decision 
   tree like the one above, the basic depth first traversal approach 
   introduces obvious inefficiencies in the path building process.  To 
   compensate for this, a path building module not only needs to decide 
   in which direction to traverse the tree, but it should also decide 
   which branch of the tree is more likely to yield a usable path. 
    
   The path building algorithm then ideally becomes a tree traversal 
   algorithm with weights or priorities assigned to each branch point to 
   guide the decision making.  If properly designed, such an approach 
   should effectively yield the "best path first" more often than not.  
   (The terminology "best path first" is quoted because the definition 
   of the "best" path may differ from PKI to PKI.  That is ultimately to 
   be determined by the developer, not by this document.)  Regardless of 
   the path building direction, a reasonable goal for every developer 
   should be to find the best path first, that being the one that is 
   most likely to validate, as often as possible, with the understanding 
   that there is no way to account for all possible configurations and 
   infrastructures. 
    
   So how should a developer go about finding the best path first?  
   Given the simplifying idea of addressing path building as a tree 
   traversal, path building can be structured as a depth first search.  
   A simple example of depth first tree traversal path building is 
   depicted in Figure 13, with no preference given to sort order.

                 All possible paths from EE to TR 
                using a depth first tree traversal 
    
      Figure 13 û Path Building Using a Depth First Tree Traversal 
    
   Figure 13 illustrates that four possible paths exist for this 
   example.  Suppose that the last path (TR->A->B->EE) is the only path 
   that will validate.  This could be for a number of reasons such as 
   name constraints, policy processing, validity periods, a path length 
   constraint, or a combination of reasons.  The goal of an efficient 
   path-building component is to select the fourth path first by testing 
   properties of the certificates as the tree is traversed.  For 
   example, when the path building software is at entity B in the graph, 
   it should examine both choices A and C to determine which certificate 
   is the most likely best choice.  Hopefully it will conclude that A is 
   the more likely correct path.  Then, at A, the module compares 
   terminating the path at TR, or moving to C.  Again, hopefully the 
   module will make the better choice (TR) and thereby find the "best 
   path first". 
    
   What if the choice between CA certificates is not binary as it was in 
   the previous example?  What if the path building software encounters 
   a branch point with some arbitrary number of CA certificates thereby 
   creating the same arbitrary number of tree branches?  (This would be 
   typical in a mesh style PKI CA, or at a Bridge CA directory entry, as 
   each will have multiple certificates issued to itself from other 
   CAs.)  This actually does not change the algorithm at all if it is

   structured properly.  In our example, rather than treating each 
   decision as binary (i.e., choosing A or C), path building software 
   should sort all the available possibilities at any given branch 
   point, and then select the first one from the list.  In the event the 
   path could not be built through the first choice, then the second CA 
   should be tried next upon traversing back to that point in the tree.  
   Continue following this pattern until a path is found or all CA nodes 
   in the tree have been traversed.  Note that the certificates at any 
   given point in the tree should only be sorted at the time a decision 
   is first made. Specifically, in the example, the sorting of A and C 
   is done when the algorithm reached B.  There is no memory resident 
   representation of the entire tree.  Just like any other recursive 
   depth first search algorithm, the only information the algorithm 
   needs to keep track of is what nodes (entities) in the tree lie 
   behind it on the current path, and for each of those nodes, which 
   edges (certificates) have already been tried. 
    
2.4     Suggested Path Building Software Components 
    
   There is no single way to define an interface to a path building 
   module; nor should there be.  It is not the intent of this paper to 
   prescribe a particular method or semantic; rather, it is up to the 
   implementer to decide.  There are many ways this could be done.  For 
   example, a path-building module could construct every conceivable 
   path and return the entire list to the caller.  Or, it could build 
   until it finds just one that validates and then terminate the 
   procedure.  Or, it could build paths in an iterative fashion, 
   depending on validation outside of the builder and successive calls 
   to the builder to get more paths until one valid path is found or all 
   possible paths have been found.  All of these are possible 
   approaches, and each of these may offer different benefits to a 
   particular environment or application. 
    
   Regardless of semantics, a path-building module needs to contain the 
   following components: 
    
   1) The logic for traversing the certificate graph. 
   2) Logic for retrieving the necessary certificates (and CRLs and/or 
      other revocation status information if the path is to be 
      validated) from the available source(s). 
    
   Assuming a more efficient and agile path building module is desired, 
   the following is a good starting point and will tie into the 
   remainder of this document.  For a path-building module to take full 
   advantage of all the suggested optimizations listed in this document, 
   it will need all of the components listed below. 
    
   1) A local certificate and CRL cache. 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph, 
Nicholas                Expires - August 2003               [Page 26] 
                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
    
        A) This may be used by all certificate-using components - it 
          does not need to be specific to the path building software.  
          A local cache could be memory resident, stored in Microsoft 
          CAPI, stored in a database, or even stored in individual 
          files on the hard disk.  While the implementation of this 
          cache is beyond the scope of this document, some design 
          considerations are describe later in Section ???. 
    
   2) The logic for traversing the certificate graph / tree. 
    
        A) This performs sorting functionality for prioritizing 
          certificates (and thereby optimizing path building) while 
          traversing the tree. 
        B) There is no need to build a complete graph prior to 
          commencing path building.  Since path building can be 
          implemented as a depth first tree traversal, the path builder 
          only needs to store the current location in the tree along 
          with the points traversed to the current location.  All 
          completed branches can be discarded from memory and future 
          branches are discovered as the tree is traversed. 
    
   3) Logic for retrieving the necessary certificates from the 
      available certificate source(s): 
    
        A) Local cache. 
           
           (i) Should be able retrieve all certificates for an entity by 
               subject name as well as individual certificates by 
               issuer and serial number tuple. 
          (ii) Tracking which directory attribute (including 
               IssuedtoThisCA and/or IssuedByThisCA) each certificate 
               was found in may be useful. This allows for 
               functionality such as retrieving only forward cross 
               certificates, etc. 
         (iii) A "freshness" timestamp (cache expiry time) can be used 
               to determine when the directory should be searched 
               again. 
                
        B) LDAPv3 directory for certificates and CRLs. 
    
           (i) Consider supporting multiple directories for general 
               queries. 
          (ii) Consider supporting dynamic LDAP connections for 
               retrieving CRLs using an LDAP URI in the CRL 
               distribution point certificate extension.

        C) HTTP support for CRL distribution points and AIA support. 
           
           (i) Consider HTTPS support 
    
   4) A certification path cache that stores previously validated 
      relationships between certificates.  This cache should include: 
    
        A) A configurable expiration date for each entry. 
        B) Support to store previously verified relationships between 
          two specific certificates. 
    
2.5     Inputs to the Path Building Module 
    
   X.509 specifically addresses the list of inputs required for path 
   validation but makes no specific suggestions as to what could be 
   useful inputs to path building.  However, given that the goal of path 
   building is to find certification paths that will validate, it 
   follows that the same inputs used for validation should be used to 
   optimize path building. 
    
2.5.1 Required Inputs 
      
   The following are required inputs to the certification path building 
   process: 
    
   1) The Target Certificate - The certificate that is to be validated. 
      This is one end point for the path. 
    
   2) Trusted Root List û This is the other endpoint of the path, and 
      can consist of either: 
    
        A) Trusted CA certificates 
        B) Trusted keys and distinguished names û a certificate is not 
          necessarily required 
    
2.5.2 Optional Inputs 
      
   In addition to the inputs defined in Section 2.5.1, the following 
   optional inputs can be useful for optimizing path building.  However, 
   if the path building software takes advantage of all of the 
   optimization rules described later in this document, all of the 
   following optional inputs will be required. 
    
   1) Time (T) û The time for which the certificate is to be validated 
      (e.g., if validating a historical signature from 1 year ago, T is 
      needed to construct a valid path).

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
        A) If not included as an input, the path building software 
          should always build for T equal to the current system time. 
    
   2) Initial-inhibit-policy-mapping indicator 
    
   3) Initial-require-explicit-policy indicator 
       
   4) Initial-any-policy-inhibit indicator 
    
   5) Initial user acceptable policy set 
    
   6) Error handlers (call backs or virtual classes) 
    
   7) Handlers for custom certificate extensions 
    
   8) Collection of certificates that may be useful in building the 
      path 
    
   9) Collection of certificate revocation lists and/or other 
      revocation data 
    
   The last two items are a matter of convenience.  Alternately, 
   certificates and revocation information could be placed in a local 
   cache accessible to the path building module prior to attempting to 
   build a path. 
    
3.    Optimizing Path Building Functions 
    
   This section recommends methods for optimizing path building 
   processes. 
    
3.1     Optimized Path Building 
    
   Path building can be optimized by sorting the certificates at every 
   decision point (at every node in the tree) and then selecting the 
   most promising certificate not yet selected.  This process continues 
   until the path terminates.  This is roughly equivalent to the concept 
   of creating a weighted edge tree, where the edges are represented by 
   certificates and nodes represent DNs.   
    
   The concept of statelessness with respect to nodes not in the current 
   path is instrumental to using the sorting optimizations listed in 
   this document.  Initially, it may seem that sorting a given group of 
   certificates for a CA once and then preserving that sorted order for 
   later use would be an efficient way to write the path builder.  
   However, maintaining this state can quickly eliminate the efficiency 
   introduced by sorting.  Consider the following diagram:

               | B |<----->| C |  
               +---+       +---+ 
    
   In this example, the path builder is building in the forward (from 
   target) direction for a path between R and EE.  The path builder has 
   also opted to allow subject name & key to repeat.  (This will allow 
   multiple traversals through any of the cross certified CAs, creating 
   enough complexity in this small example to illustrate proper state 
   maintenance.  Note that a similarly complex example could be designed 
   by using multiple keys for each entity and prohibiting repetition.) 
    
   The first step is simple; the builder constructs the path Z(D)-
   >EE(Z).  Now the builder adds D and faces a decision between two 
   certificates.  (Choose between D(C) or D(E)) The builder should now 
   sort the two choices in order of priority. The sorting is partially 
   based upon what is currently in the path. 
    
   Suppose the order the builder selects is [D(E), D(C)].  The current 
   path is now D(E)->Z(D)->EE(Z). Currently the builder has three nodes 
   in the graph (EE, Z, and D) and should maintain the state, including 
   sort order of the certificates at D, when adding the next node, E.  
   When E is added, the builder now has four certificates to sort: E(A), 
   E(B), E(C), and E(D).  In this case, the example builder opts for the 
   order [E(C), E(B), E(A), E(D)].  The current path is now E(C)->D(E)-
   >Z(D)->EE(Z) and the path has four nodes; EE, Z, D, and E. 
    
   Upon adding the fifth node, C, the builder sorts the certificates 
   (C(B), C(D), and C(E)) at C, and selects C(E).  The path is now C(E)-
   >E(C)->D(E)->Z(D)->EE(Z) and the path has five nodes; EE, Z, D, E, 
   and C.  
    
   Now the builder finds itself back at node E with four certificates.  
   If the builder were to use the prior sort order from the first 
   encounter with E, it would have [E(C), E(B), E(A), E(D)].  In the

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   current path's context, this ordering may be inappropriate.  To begin 
   with, the certificate E(C) is already in the path so it certainly 
   does not deserve first place. 
    
   The best way to handle this situation is for the path builder to 
   handle this instance of E as a new (sixth) node in the tree.  In 
   other words, there is no state information for this new instance of E 
   - it is treated just as any other new node.  The certificates at the 
   new node are sorted based upon the current path content and the first 
   certificate is then selected.  For example, the builder may examine 
   E(B) and note that it contains a name constraint prohibiting "C".  At 
   this point in the decision tree, E(B) could not be added to the path 
   and produce a valid result since "C" is already in the path.  As a 
   result, the certificate E(B) should placed at the bottom of the 
   prioritized list. 
    
   Alternatively, E(B) could be eliminated from this new node in the 
   tree.  It is very important to see that this certificate is 
   eliminated ONLY at this node and ONLY for the current path.  If path 
   building fails through C and traverses back up the tree to the first 
   instance of E, E(B) could still produce a valid path that does not 
   include C; specifically R->A->B->E->D->Z->EE.  Thus the state at any 
   node should not alter the state of previous or subsequent nodes.  
   (Except for prioritizing certificates in the subsequent nodes.) 
    
   In this example, the builder should also note that E(C) is already in 
   the path and make it last or eliminate it from this node since 
   certificates can not be repeated in a path. 
    
   If the builder eliminates both certificates E(B) and E(C) at this 
   node, it is now only left to select between E(A) and E(D).  Now the 
   path has six nodes; EE, Z, D, E(1), C, and E(2).  E(1) has four 
   certificates, and E(2) has two, which the builder sorts to yield 
   [E(A), E(D)]. The current path is now E(A)->C(E)->E(C)->D(E)->Z(D)-
   >EE(Z).  A(R) will be discovered when the seventh node is added to 
   the path and the path terminated because one of the trusted root keys 
   has been found. 
    
   In the event the first path fails to validate, the path builder 
   should still have the seven nodes and associated state information to 
   work with.  On the next iteration, the path builder is able to 
   traverse back up the tree to a working decision point, such as A, and 
   select the next certificate in the sorted list at A.  In this 
   example, that would be A(B).  (A(R) has already been tested.) This 
   would dead end, and the builder traverse back up to the next decision 
   point, E(2) where it would try D(E).  This process repeats until the 
   traversal backs all the way up to EE or a valid path is found.  If

   the tree traversal returns to EE, all possible paths have been 
   exhausted and the builder can conclude no valid path exists. 
    
   This approach of sorting certificates in order to optimize path 
   building will yield better results than not optimizing the tree 
   traversal.  However, the path building process can be further 
   streamlined by eliminating certificates, and entire branches of the 
   tree as a result, as paths are constructed. 
    
3.2    Sorting vs. Elimination 
    
   Consider a situation where there exists three CA certificates to 
   choose between at some point in building a path for a given target 
   certificate.  When the certificates are examined, like in the 
   previous example, one of the three has a name constraint present that 
   will invalidate the path constructed thus far.  When sorting the 
   three certificates, that one would certainly go to the back of the 
   line.  However, the path building software could decide that this 
   condition should eliminate the certificate from consideration at this 
   point in the graph, thereby reducing the number of certificate 
   choices by 33% at this point. 
    
   NOTE: It is important to understand that the elimination of a 
   certificate only applies to a single decision point during the tree 
   traversal.  The same certificate may appear again on another point in 
   the tree; at that point it may or may not be eliminated.  The prior 
   section details an example of this behavior. 
    
   Elimination of certificates could potentially eliminate the traversal 
   of a large, time-consuming infrastructure that will never lead to a 
   valid path.  The question of whether to sort or eliminate is one that 
   pits the flexibility of the software interface against efficiency. 
    
   To be clear, if one eliminates invalid paths as they are built, 
   returning only likely valid paths, the end result will be an 
   efficient path building module.  The drawback to this is that unless 
   the software makes allowances for it the calling application will not 
   be able to see what went wrong.  The user may only see the 
   unrevealing error message: "No certification path found." 
    
   On the other hand, the path building module could opt to not rule out 
   any certification paths.  The path building software could then 
   return any and all paths it can construct from the certificate graph.  
   It is then up to the validation engine to determine which are valid 
   and which are invalid.  The user or calling application can then have 
   complete details on why each and every path fails to validate.  The 
   drawback is obviously one of performance, as an application or end

   user may wait for an extended period of time while cross-certified 
   PKIs are navigated in order to build paths that will never validate. 
    
   Neither option is a very desirable approach.  One option removes a 
   performance burden on end users, which is always wise to do.  The 
   other option though allows administrators to diagnose problems with 
   the PKI, directory, or software.  Below are some recommendations to 
   reach a middle ground on this issue. 
    
   First, developers are strongly encouraged to output detailed log 
   files from the path building software.  The log should explicitly 
   indicate every choice the builder makes and why.  It should clearly 
   identify which certificates are found and used at each step in 
   building the path.  If care is taken to produce a useful log file, 
   PKI administrators and help desk personnel should have ample 
   information to diagnose a problem with the PKI.  Ideally, there 
   should be a mechanism for turning this logging on and off, so that it 
   is not running all the time. 
    
   Secondly, it is desirable to return something useful to the user.  
   The easiest approach is probably to implement a "dual mode" path 
   building module.  In the first mode [mode 1], the software eliminates 
   any and all paths that will not validate, making it very efficient.  
   In the second mode [mode 2], all the sorting rules are still applied, 
   but no paths are eliminated based upon the rules.  Having this dual 
   mode allows the module to first fail to find a valid path, but still 
   return one invalid path (assuming one exists) by switching over to 
   the second mode long enough to generate a single path.  This provides 
   a middle ground û the software is very fast, but still returns 
   something that gives the user a more specific error than "no path 
   found". 
    
   Ultimately, it is up to the developer to determine how to handle the 
   tradeoff between efficiency and provision of information.  A 
   developer could choose the middle ground by opting to implement some 
   optimizations as elimination rules and others as not.  A developer 
   could validate certificate signatures, or even check revocation 
   status while building the path, and then make decisions based upon 
   the outcome of those checks as to whether to eliminate the 
   certificate in question. 
    
   This document suggests the following approach: 
    
   1) While building paths, eliminate any and all certificates that do 
      not satisfy all path validation requirements with the following 
      exceptions: 
    

 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph,

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
        A) Do not check revocation status if it requires a directory 
          lookup or network access 
        B) Do not check signatures 
        C) Do not check anything that can not be checked as part of the 
          iterative process of traversing the tree 
        D) Write a detailed log file, if this feature is enabled 
        E) If a path cannot be found, the path builder shifts to "mode 
          2" and allows the building of a single bad path. 
    
           (i) Return the path with a failure indicator as well as error 
               information detailing why the path is bad. 
    
   2) If path building succeeds, validate the path in accordance with 
      [X.509] and [RFC 3280] with the following recommendations:  
    
        A) For a performance boost, do not re-check items already 
          checked by the path builder. (Note: if the software interface 
          allows validation of user supplied paths, the validation 
          component must perform full validation on those paths.) 
        B) If the path validation failed, call the path builder again to 
          build another path 
    
           (i) Always store the error information and path from the 
               first iteration û return this to the user in the event 
               no valid path is found.  Since the path building 
               software was designed to return the "best path first", 
               this is the path that should be shown to the user. 
    
   As stated above, this document recommends that developers do not 
   validate signatures or check revocation status as part of the path 
   building process.  This recommendation is based on two assumptions 
   about PKI and its usage.  First, signatures in a working PKI are 
   almost always good.  Since signature validation is a costly process 
   from a CPU standpoint, it is better to delay signature checking until 
   a complete path is found.  Second, it is fairly uncommon in typical 
   application environments to encounter a revoked key; therefore, most 
   certificates validated will not be revoked.  As a result, it is 
   better to delay retrieving CRLs, or other revocation status 
   information, until a complete path has been found, thereby reducing 
   the probability of retrieving unneeded revocation status information 
   while building paths. 
    
3.3     Path Building Optimization 
    
   The following sections describe methods that may be used for 
   optimizing the certification path building process by sorting 
   certificates.  Optimization as described earlier seeks to prioritize 
   a list of certificates, effectively prioritizing (weighting) branches 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph, 
Nicholas                Expires - August 2003               [Page 34] 
                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   of the graph / tree, the optimization methods should be used to 
   assign a cumulative score to each certificate. The process of scoring 
   the certificates amounts to testing each certificate against the 
   optimization methods a developer chooses to implement, and then 
   adding the score for each test to a cumulative score for each 
   certificate. After this is completed for each certificate at a given 
   branch point in the builder's decision tree, the certificates can be 
   sorted so that the highest scoring certificate is selected first, the 
   second highest is selected second, etc. 
    
   For example, suppose the path builder has only these two simple 
   rules: 
    
   1) If the certificate has a subject key ID, +5 to score 
   2) If the certificate has an authority key ID, +10 to score 
    
   And it then examined three certificates: 
    
   1) Issued by CA 1; has authority key ID; score is 10 
   2) Issued by CA 2; has subject key ID; score is 5 
   3) Issued by CA 1; has subject key ID and authority key ID; score is 
      15 
    
   The three certificates are sorted in descending order starting with 
   the highest score: 3, 1, and 2.  The path building software should 
   first try building the path through certificate 3.  Failing that, it 
   should try certificate 1.  Lastly, it should try building a path 
   through certificate 2. 
    
   The following optimization methods specify tests developers may 
   choose to perform, but does not suggest scores for any of the 
   methods. Rather, developers should evaluate each method with respect 
   to the environment that the application will operate, and assign 
   weights to each accordingly in the path building software.  
   Additionally, many of the optimization methods are not binary in 
   nature.  Some are tri-valued, and some may be well suited to sliding 
   or exponential scales. Ultimately, it is up to the implementer to 
   decide the relative merits of each rule with respect to his or her 
   own software or infrastructure. 
    
   Over and above the scores for each method, many methods can be used 
   to eliminate branches during the tree traversal rather than simply 
   scoring and weighting them. All cases where certificates could be 
   eliminated based upon an optimization method are noted with the 
   method descriptions. 
    
   As a final note, many of the sorting methods described below are 
   based upon what has been perceived by the author as common in PKIs.  
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph, 
Nicholas                Expires - August 2003               [Page 35] 
                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   Many of the rules are aimed at making path development for common PKI 
   efficient, but there are cases where most any sorting rule could lead 
   path building astray.  The assumption is that although one rule may 
   lead the algorithm in the wrong direction for a given situation or 
   configuration, the remaining rules will overcome the errant rule(s) 
   and send the path traversal down the correct branch of the tree more 
   often than not.  This certainly will not be true for every 
   environment and configuration, and these methods may need to be 
   tweaked for further optimization in the applications target operating 
   environment.  The list contained in this document is not intended to 
   be exhaustive.  A developer may desire to define additional sorting 
   methods if the operating environment dictates the need. 
    
3.3.1 Selected Methods for Sorting Certificates 
    
   Although an effort was made to order these sorting methods starting 
   with the stronger rules first, no specific conclusion should be drawn 
   as to relative merits or scores.  The relative merit of any sorting 
   criteria is completely dependant on the specifics the operating 
   environment.  For most any method, an example can be created to 
   demonstrate the method is effective.  Alternately, an example could 
   be designed to demonstrate that it is ineffective. 
    
   Each rule is independent and may (or may not) be used to assign 
   additional scores to each certificate tested. It is up to the 
   implementer to decide which methods to use and what weights to assign 
   them. As noted previously, this list is also not exhaustive.  
    
   In addition, name chaining (The subject name of the issuer 
   certificate must match the issuer name of the issued certificate.) is 
   not addressed as a sorting rule since adherence to this is required 
   in order to build the decision tree to which these rules will be 
   applied.  Also unaddressed in the sorting methods is the prevention 
   of repeating certificates. Path builders should handle these items 
   irrespective of optimization approach. 
    
3.3.1.1   basicConstraints is Present and cA Equals True 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: Yes 
   Number of possible values: Binary 
   Components required: None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates with basicConstraints present and cA=TRUE 
   have priority.  Certificates without basicConstraints, or with 
   basicConstraints and cA=FALSE may be eliminated or should have zero 
   priority.

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   Reverse Rule:  Same as forward except with regard to end entity 
   certificates at the terminus of the path. 
    
   Justification:  According to RFC 3280, basicConstraints is required 
   to be present with cA=TRUE in all CA certificates.  A valid path can 
   not be constructed if this condition is not met. 
    
3.3.1.2   Recognized Signature Algorithms 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: Yes 
   Number of possible values: Binary 
   Components required: None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates containing recognized signature and 
   public key algorithms have priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Same as forward. 
    
   Justification:  If the path building software is not capable of 
   processing the signatures associated with the certificate, the 
   certification path cannot be validated. 
    
3.3.1.3   keyUsage is Correct 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates:  Yes 
   Number of possible values:  Binary 
   Components required:  None 
    
   Forward Rule:  If keyUsage is present, certificates with keyCertSign 
   set have 100% priority.  If keyUsage is present and keyCertSign is 
   not set, the certificate may be eliminated or have zero priority. All 
   others have zero priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Same as forward. 
    
   Justification:  A valid certification path can not be constructed 
   through a CA certificate with inappropriate keyUsage.  Note that 
   digitalSignature is NOT required to be set in a CA certificate. 
    
3.3.1.4   Time (T) Falls within the Certificate Validity 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates:  Yes 
   Number of possible values:  Binary 
   Components required:  None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates that contain the required time (T) within 
   their validity period have 100% priority.  Otherwise, the certificate 
   should be eliminated or have priority zero.

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Same as forward. 
    
   Justification:  A valid certification path cannot be constructed if T 
   falls outside of the certificate validity period. 
    
   NOTE: Special care should be taken to return a meaningful error to 
   the caller, especially in the event the target certificate does not 
   meet this rule, if this rule is used for elimination.  (e.g., the 
   certificate is expired). 
    
3.3.1.5   Certificate Was Previously Validated 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates:  No 
   Number of possible values:  Binary 
   Components required:  Certificate Path Cache 
    
   Forward Rule:  A certificate that is present in the certification 
   path cache has priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Does not apply. (The validity of a certificate vs. 
   unknown validity does not infer anything about the correct direction 
   in the decision tree.  In other words, knowing the validity of a CA 
   certificate does not indicate that the target is more likely found 
   through that path than another.) 
    
   Justification:  Certificates in the path cache have been validated 
   previously.  There is some probability that the path from that 
   certificate to a trusted root is still valid.  
    
   Note:  It is important that items in the path cache have appropriate 
   life times. For example, it could be inappropriate to cache a 
   relationship beyond the period the related CRL will be trusted by the 
   application. It is also critical to consider certificates and CRLs 
   farther up the path when setting cache lifetimes. For example, if the 
   issuer cert expires in ten days, but the issued certificate is valid 
   for 20 days, caching the relationship beyond 10 days would be 
   inappropriate. 
    
3.3.1.6   Previously Verified Signatures 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates:  Yes 
   Number of possible values:  Binary 
   Components required:  Path Cache 
    
   Forward Rule:   If a previously verified relationship exists in the 
   path cache between the subject certificate and a public key present 
   in one or more issuer certificates, all the certificates containing 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   said public key have higher priority.  Other certificates may be 
   eliminated or set to zero priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Does not apply. (Although the path cache does contain 
   one to one relationships in reverse, nothing can be concluded about 
   the likelihood of finding a given target certificate down one branch 
   versus another using this rule.) 
    
   Justification:  If the public key in a certificate (A) was previously 
   used to verify a signature on a second certificate (B), any and all 
   certificates containing the same key as (A) may be used to verify the 
   signature on (B).  Likewise, any certificates that do not contain the 
   same key as (A) cannot be used to verify the signature on (B).  This 
   forward direction rule is especially strong for multiply cross-
   certified CAs after a key rollover has occurred. 
    
3.3.1.7   Path Length Constraints 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: Yes 
   Number of possible values: Binary 
   Components required: None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates with basic constraints present and 
   containing a path length constraint that would invalidate the current 
   path (the current length is known since the software is building from 
   the target certificate) may be eliminated or set to zero priority.  
   Otherwise, the priority is 100%. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  This rule may be applied in reverse, but the benefit 
   is likely less than that of the forward direction.  To apply it, the 
   builder keeps a current path length constraint variable and then sets 
   zero priority for (or eliminates) certificates that would violate the 
   constraint.  
    
   Justification:  A valid path cannot be constructed if the path length 
   constraint has been violated. 
    
3.3.1.8   Name Constraints 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates:  Yes 
   Number of possible values:  Binary 
   Components required:  None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates that contain nameConstraints that would 
   be violated by certificates already in the path to this point should 
   have lower priority. (Or they may be eliminated.)

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   Reverse Rule:  Certificates that will allow successful processing of 
   any name constraints present in the path to this point should have 
   priority 
    
   Justification:  A valid path cannot be constructed if name 
   constraints are violated. 
    
3.3.1.9   Certificate is Not Revoked 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: No 
   Number of possible values:  Three 
   Components required:  CRL Cache 
    
   Forward Rule:  If a current CRL for a certificate is present in the 
   CRL cache, and the certificate serial number is not on the CRL, the 
   certificate has priority.  If the certificate serial number is 
   present on the CRL, it has zero priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Same as Forward. 
    
   Alternately, the certificate may be eliminated if the CRL is 
   verified.  That is, fully verify the CRL signature and relationship 
   to the certificate in question in accordance with RFC 3280.  While 
   this is viable, the signature verifications required make it less 
   attractive as an elimination rule. It is suggested that this rule 
   only be used for sorting and that CRLs are validated post path 
   building. 
    
   Justification:  Certificates known to be not revoked should be, on 
   average, more likely to be valid than certificates for which the 
   revocation status is unknown.  This is further justified if CRL 
   validation is performed post path validation û CRLs are only 
   retrieved when complete paths are found. 
    
   NOTE:  Special care should be taken to allow meaningful errors to 
   propagate to the caller, especially in cases where the target 
   certificate is revoked.  If a path builder eliminates certificates 
   using CRLs, some status information should be preserved so that a 
   meaningful error may be returned in the event no path is found. 
    
3.3.1.10  Issuer Found in the Path Cache 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: No 
   Number of possible values: Binary 
   Components required:  Certificate Path Cache 
    
   Forward Rule:  A certificate whose issuer has an entry (or entries) 
   in the path cache has priority. 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph,

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Does not apply. 
    
   Justification:  Since the path cache only contains entries for 
   certificates that were previously validated back to a trusted root, 
   it is more likely than not that the same or a new path may be 
   constructed from that point to the (or one of the) trusted root(s).  
   For certificates whose issuers are not found in the path cache, 
   nothing can be concluded. 
    
   NOTE: This rule is not the same as the preceding rule.  It is 
   possible for this rule to evaluate to true while the preceding rule 
   could evaluate to zero. 
    
3.3.1.11  Matching Key Identifiers (KIDs) 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates:  No 
   Number of possible values:  Three 
   Components required:  None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates whose subject key identifier (SKID) 
   matches the current certificate's authority key identifier (AKID) 
   have highest priority.  Certificates without a SKID have medium 
   priority. Certificates whose SKID does not match the current 
   certificate's AKID (if both are present) have zero priority.  If the 
   current certificate expresses the issuer name and serial number in 
   the AKID, certificates that match both these identifiers have highest 
   priority. Certificates that match only the issuer name in the AKID 
   have medium priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Certificates whose AKID matches the current 
   certificate's SKID have highest priority.  Certificates without an 
   AKID have medium priority.  Certificates whose AKID does not match 
   the current certificate's SKID (if both are present) have zero 
   priority.  If the certificate expresses the issuer name and serial 
   number in the AKID, certificates that match both these identifiers in 
   the current certificate have highest priority.  Certificates that 
   match only the issuer name in the AKID have medium priority. 
    
   Justification:  KID matching is a very useful mechanism for guiding 
   path building (that is their purpose in the certificate) and should 
   therefore be assigned a heavy weight. 
    
   NOTE: It is extremely important that KIDs be used ONLY as sorting 
   criteria û KIDs are not required to match by any PKI standard and 
   must not be used to eliminate certificates.  This is of critical 
   importance for interoperating across domains and multi-vendor

   implementations where the KIDs may not be calculated in the same 
   fashion. 
    
3.3.1.12  Policy Processing 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: Yes 
   Number of possible values: Three 
   Components required: None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates that satisfy Forward Policy Chaining have 
   priority.  (See the section entitled "Forward Policy Chaining" for 
   details.)  If the caller provided an initial-policy-set and did not 
   set the initial-require-explicit flag, the weight of this rule should 
   be increased.  If the initial-require-explicit-policy flag was set by 
   the caller or by a certificate, certificates may be eliminated. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Certificates that contain policies/policy mappings 
   that will allow successful policy processing of the path to this 
   point should have priority.  If the caller provided an initial-
   policy-set and did not set the initial-require-explicit flag, the 
   weight of this rule should be increased.  Certificates may be 
   eliminated if initial-require-explicit was set by the caller or if 
   require-explicit-policy was set by a certificate in the path to this 
   point. 
    
   Justification:  In a policy-using environment, certificates that 
   successfully propagate policies are more likely part of an intended 
   certification path than those that do not. 
    
   When building in the forward direction, it is always possible that a 
   certificate closer to the trusted root will set the require-explicit-
   policy indicator; so giving preference to certificate paths that 
   propagate policies may increase the probability of finding a valid 
   path first.  If the caller (or a certificate in the current path) has 
   specified or set the initial-require-explicit-policy indicator as 
   true, this rule can also be used to eliminate certificates when 
   building in the forward direction. 
    
   If building in reverse, it is always possible that a certificate 
   farther along the path will set the require-explicit-policy 
   indicator; so giving preference to those certificates that propagate 
   policies will serve well in that case.  In the case where require-
   explicit-policy is set by certificates or the caller, certificates 
   can be eliminated with this rule.

   Number of possible values: Additive 
   Components required: None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates that assert policies found in the 
   initial-acceptable-policy-set should have priority.  Each additional 
   matching policy could have an additive affect on the total score.  
   Alternately, this could be binary; it matches 1 or more, or matches 
   none. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Certificates that assert policies found in the target 
   certificate or map policies to those found in the target certificate 
   should have priority.  Each additional matching policy could have an 
   additive affect on the total score.  Alternately, this could be 
   binary; it matches 1 or more, or matches none. 
    
   Justification:  In the forward direction, as the path draws near to 
   the trusted root certificate in a cross certified environment, the 
   policies asserted in the CA certificates should match those in the 
   caller's domain.  Since the initial acceptable policy set is 
   specified in the caller's domain, matches may indicate that the path 
   building is drawing nearer to a desired trusted root.  In the reverse 
   direction, finding policies that match those of the target 
   certificate may indicate the path is drawing near to the target's 
   domain.

   Forward Rule:  Certificates whose issuer exactly matches a trusted 
   root subject DN have priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Certificates whose subject exactly matches the target

   Justification:  In the forward direction, if a certificate's issuer 
   DN matches a trusted root's DN, then it may complete the path.  In 
   the reverse direction, if the certificate's subject DN matches the 
   issuer DN of the target certificate, this may be the last certificate 
   required to complete the path.

   Forward Rule:  Certificates that match more ordered RDNs between the 
   issuer DN and a trust anchor DN should have priority.  When all the 
   RDNs match, this should yield the highest priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule: Certificates with subject DNs that match more RDNs with 
   the target's issuer DN should have higher priority.  When all the 
   RDNs match, this should yield the highest priority. 
    
   Justification:  In PKIs the DNs are frequently constructed in a tree 
   like fashion.  Higher numbers of matches may indicate that the trust 
   root is to be found in that direction within the tree.  Note that in 
   the 100% match case, this rule appears to mirror the preceding rule.  
   However, this rule should be capable of producing a 100% result even 
   if the issuer DN has more RDNs than the trust root.  The Issuer DN 
   need only contain all the RDNs (in order) of the trust root. 
    
   NOTE: In the 100% match case, this rule mirrors the functionality of 
   the preceding rule.  This allows for partial matches to be weighted 
   differently from exact matches. Additionally, this rule can be 
   particularly CPU intensive if many trusted roots are present. 
    
3.3.1.16  Certificates are Retrieved from cACertificate 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: No 
   Number of possible values: Binary 
   Components required: Certificate Cache with flags for the attribute 
   from where the certificate was retrieved 
    
   Forward Rule:   Certificates retrieved from the cACertificate 
   attribute have priority over certificates retrieved from the 
   crossCertificate attribute. (See RFC 2587) 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Does not apply. 
    
   Justification:  The cACertificate attribute contains certificates 
   issued from local sources and self issued certificates.  By using the 
   cACertificate attribute before the crossCertificate attribute, the 
   path building algorithm will (depending on the local PKI 
   configuration) tend to demonstrate a preference for the local PKI 
   before venturing to external cross-certified PKIs.  Not only do most 
   of today's PKI applications spend most of their time processing 
   information from the local (user's own) PKI, but the local PKI is 
   usually very efficient to traverse due to simplicity, proximity and 
   network speed. 
    
3.3.1.17  Consistent Public Key and Signature Algorithms 
    
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,

   May be used to eliminate certificates: Yes 
   Number of possible values: Binary 
   Components required: None 
    
   Forward Rule:  If the public key in the issuer certificate matches 
   the algorithm used to sign the subject certificate, then it priority.  
   (Certificates with unmatched public key and signature algorithms may 
   be eliminated.) 
    
   Reverse Rule:  If the public key in the current certificate matches 
   the algorithm used to sign the subject certificate, then it has 
   priority.  (Certificates with unmatched public key and signature 
   algorithms may be eliminated.) 
    
   Justification:  Since the public key and signature algorithms aren't 
   consistent, the signature on the subject certificate will not 
   successfully.  For example, if the issuer certificate contains an RSA 
   public key, then it could not have issued a subject certificate 
   signed with the DSA-with-SHA-1 algorithm. 
    
3.3.1.18  Similar Issuer and Subject Names 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates:  No 
   Number of possible values:  Sliding Scale 
   Components required:  None 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates that match more RDNs between the subject 
   DN and the issuer DN should have priority. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Same as forward. 
    
   Justification:  As it is generally more efficient to search the local 
   domain prior to branching to cross-certified domains, using 
   certificates with similar names first tends to make a more efficient 
   path builder.  Cross certificates issued from external domains will 
   generally match fewer RDNs (if any), whereas certificates in the 
   local domain will frequently match multiple RDNs.

   Storage / Retrieval (E.g., LDAP repository) 
    
   Forward Rule:  A certificate whose issuer certificate is present in 
   the certificate cache (and populated with one or more certificates) 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph,

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   has priority.  A certificate whose issuer certificate is present in 
   the certificate cache and fully populated with recent data (all 
   certificate attributes have been searched within an appropriate 
   timeout period û something shorter than cache expiry.) has higher 
   priority. (This helps reduce LDAP lookups until necessary.) 
    
   Reverse Rule:  If an entity named by a reverse certificate is present 
   in the certificate cache and populated with certificates then it has 
   higher priority.  If the entry is fully populated with current data 
   (all certificate attributes have been searched within the timeout 
   period.) then it has higher priority. 
    
   Justification:  The presence of required directory values populated 
   in the cache increases the likelihood that all the required 
   certificates and CRLs needed to complete the path from this 
   certificate to the root (or target if building in reverse) are 
   present in the cache from a prior path being developed, thereby 
   eliminating the need for directory access to complete the path.  In 
   the event no path can be found, the performance cost is low since the 
   certificates were likely not retrieved from the network. 
    
3.3.1.20  Current CRL Found in Local Cache 
    
   May be used to eliminate certificates: No 
   Number of possible values:  Binary 
   Components Required:  CRL Cache 
    
   Forward Rule:  Certificates have priority if the issuer's CRL entry 
   exists and is populated with current data in the CRL cache. 
    
   Reverse Rule:  Certificates have priority if the subject's CRL entry 
   exists and is populated with current data in the CRL cache. 
    
   Justification:  If revocation is checked only after a complete path 
   has been found, this indicates that a complete path has been found 
   through this entity at some past point, so a path still likely 
   exists.  This also helps reduce LDAP lookups until necessary. 
    
4.   Forward Policy Chaining 
    
   It is tempting to jump to the conclusion that certificate policies 
   offer little to path building when building from the target 
   certificate.  It's easy to understand the "validate as you go" 
   approach from the trusted root and much less obvious to some that any 
   value can be derived in the other direction.  However, since policy 
   validation consists of the intersection of the issuer policy set with 
   the subject policy set and the mapping of policies from the issuer 
   set to the subject set, policy validation can be done while 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph, 
Nicholas                Expires - August 2003               [Page 46] 
                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   constructing a path in the forward direction as well as the reverse. 
   It is simply a matter of reversing the procedure.  That is not to say 
   this is quite as ideal as policy validation when building from the 
   root, but it does offer a method that can be used to mostly eliminate 
   what has been long touted as a weakness inherent to building in the 
   forward (from the end entity or target certificate) direction. 
    
4.1     Simple Intersection 
    
   The most basic form of policy processing is the intersection of the 
   policy sets from the first CA certificate through the target / end 
   entity certificate.  Fortunately, the intersection of policy sets 
   will always yield the same final set regardless of the order of 
   intersection.  This allows processing of policy set intersections in 
   either direction. For example, if the trusted root issues a CA 
   certificate (A) with policies {X,Y,Z}, and that CA issues another CA 
   certificate (B) with policies {X,Y}, and CA B then issues a third CA 
   certificate (C) with policy set {Y,G}, one normally calculates the 
   policy set from the root as follows: 
    
   1) Intersect A{X,Y,Z} with B{X,Y} to yield the set {X,Y} 
   2) Intersect that result, {X,Y} with C{Y,G} to yield the final set 
      {Y} 
    
   Now it has been shown that certificate C is good for policy Y. 
    
   The other direction is exactly the same procedure, only in reverse: 
    
   1) Intersect C{Y,G} with B{X,Y} to yield the set {Y} 
   2) Intersect that result, {Y} with A{X,Y,Z} to yield the final set 
      {Y} 
    
   Just like in the reverse direction, it has been shown that 
   certificate C is good for policy Y, but this time in the forward 
   direction. 
    
   When building in the forward direction, policy processing is handled 
   in much the same fashion as it is in reverse û the software should 
   lend preference to certificates that propagate policies.  Neither 
   approach guarantees that a path with valid policies will be found, 
   but rather both approaches help guide the path in the direction it 
   should go in order for the policies to propagate. 
    
   If the caller has supplied an initial-acceptable-policy set, there is 
   less value in using it when building in the forward direction unless 
   the caller also set inhibit-policy-mapping.  In that case, the path 
   builder can further constrain the path building to propagating 
   policies that exist in the initial-acceptable-policy-set.  However, 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph, 
Nicholas                Expires - August 2003               [Page 47] 
                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   even if the inhibit-policy-mapping is not set, the initial-policy-set 
   can still be used to guide the path building toward the desired trust 
   anchor. 
    
4.2     Policy Mapping 
    
   When a CA issues a certificate into another domain û an environment 
   with disparate policy identifiers to its own û the CA may make use of 
   policy mappings to map equivalence from the local domain's policy to 
   the foreign domain's policy.  If in the prior example, A had included 
   a policy mapping that mapped X to G in the certificate it issued to 
   B, C would be good for X and Y: 
    
   1) Intersect A{X,Y,Z} with B{X,Y} to yield the set {X,Y} 
   2) Process Policy Mappings in B's certificate (X maps to G) to yield 
      {G,Y} (same as {Y,G}) 
   3) Intersect that result, {G,Y} with C{Y,G} to yield the final set 
      {G,Y} 
    
   Since policies are always expressed in the relying party's domain, 
   the certificate C is said to be good for {X, Y}, not {Y, G}.  This is 
   because "G" doesn't mean anything in the context of the trusted root 
   that issued A without the policy mapping. 
    
   When building in the forward direction, policies can be "unmapped" by 
   reversing the mapping procedure.  This procedure is limited by one 
   important aspect; if policy mapping has occurred in the forward 
   direction, there is no mechanism by which it can be known in advance 
   whether or not a future addition to the current path will invalidate 
   the policy chain (assuming one exists) by setting inhibit-policy-
   mapping.  Fortunately, it is uncommon practice to set this flag.  The 
   following is the procedure for processing policy mapping in the 
   forward direction: 
    
   1) Begin with C's policy set {Y,G} 
   2) Apply the policy mapping in B's certificate (X maps to G) in 
      reverse to yield {Y,X} (same as {X,Y}) 
   3) Intersect the rest {X,Y} with B{X,Y} to yield the set {X,Y} 
   4) Intersect that result, {X,Y}, with A{X,Y,Z} to yield the final 
      set {X,Y} 
    
   Just like in the reverse direction, it is determined in the forward 
   direction that certificate C is good for policies {X, Y}. If during 
   this procedure, an inhibit-policy-mapping flag was encountered, what 
   should be done?  This is reasonably easy to keep track of as well.  
   The software simply maintains a flag on any policies that were 
   propagated as a result of a mapping; just a simple Boolean kept with 
   the policies in the set.  Imagine now that the certificate issued to 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph,

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   A has the inhibit-policy-mapping constraint expressed with a skip 
   certificates value of zero. 
    
   1) Begin with C's policy set {Y,G} 
   2) Apply the policy mapping in B's certificate and mark X as 
      resulting from a mapping. (X maps to G) in reverse to yield {Y, 
      Xm} (same as {Xm,Y}) 
   3) Intersect the rest {Xm, Y} with B{X,Y} to yield the set {Xm, Y} 
   4) A's certificate expresses the inhibit policy mapping constraint, 
      so eliminate any policies in the current set that were propagated 
      due to mapping (which is Xm) to yield {Y} 
   5) Intersect that result, {Y} with A{X,Y,Z} to yield the final set 
      {Y} 
    
   If in our example, the policy set had gone to empty at any point (and 
   require-explicit-policy was set), the path building should back up 
   and try to traverse another branch of the tree.  This is analogous to 
   the path building functionality utilized in the reverse direction 
   when the policy set goes to empty. 
    
4.3     Assigning Scores for Forward Policy Chaining 
    
   Assuming the path building module is maintaining the current forward 
   policy set; weights may be assigned using the following procedure: 
    
   1) For each CA certificate being scored; 
        A) Copy the current forward policy set 
        B) Process policy mappings in the CA certificate in order to 
          "un-map" policies, if any 
        C) Intersect the resulting set with CA certificate's policies 
    
   The larger the policy set yielded, the larger the score for that CA 
   certificate. 
    
   2) If an initial acceptable set was supplied, intersect this set 
      with the resulting set for each CA certificate from (1). 
    
   The larger the resultant set, the higher the score is for this 
   certificate. 
    
   Other rules and scoring schemes may work better if the operating 
   environment dictates. 
    
5.   Avoiding Common Path Building Errors 
 
   This section defines some common errors that may occur during the 
   path building process, as well as ways to avoid these errors when 
   developing path building functions.

5.1    Dead-ends 
    
   When building certification paths in a non-hierarchical PKI 
   structure, any path building algorithm may fail prematurely without 
   finding an existing path due to a "dead-end".  Consider the example 
   below. 
    
            +----+      +---+ 
            | TR |      | Z | 
            +----+      +---+ 
               |          | 
               |          | 
               V          V 
             +---+      +---+ 
             | C |<-----| Y | 
             +---+      +---+ 
               | 
               | 
               V 
             +--------+ 
             | Target | 
             +--------+ 
    
    
   Note that in the example, C has two certificates: one issued by Y, 
   and the other issued by the Trust Root.  Suppose that a simple "find 
   issuer" algorithm is used, and the order in which the path builder 
   found the certificates was Target(C), C(Y), Y(Z), Z(Z).  In this 
   case, Z has no certificates issued by any other entities, and so the 
   simplistic path building process stops.  Since Z is not the relying 
   party's trust root, the certification path is not complete, and will 
   not validate.  This example shows that in anything but the simplest 
   PKI structure, additional path building logic must be included to 
   handle the cases in which entities are issued multiple certificates 
   from different issuers.  The path building algorithm must have the 
   ability to traverse back up the decision tree and try another path in 
   order to be robust. 
    
5.2    Loop Detection 
    
   In a non-hierarchical PKI structure, a path building algorithm may 
   become caught in a loop without finding an existing path.  Consider 
   the example below: 
    
             +----+ 
             | TR | 
             +----+

               | 
               | 
             +---+      +---+ 
             | A |    ->| Z | 
             +---+   /  +---+ 
               |    /     | 
               |   /      | 
               V  /       V 
             +---+      +---+ 
             | B |<-----| Y | 
             +---+      +---+ 
               | 
               | 
               V 
             +--------+ 
             | Target | 
             +--------+ 
    
   Let us suppose that in this example the simplest "find issuer" 
   algorithm is used, and the order in which certificates are retrieved 
   is Target(B), B(Y), Y(Z), Z(B), B(Y), Y(Z), Z(B), B(Y), ... A loop 
   has formed which will cause the correct path (Target, B, A) to never 
   be found. The certificate processing system must recognize loops 
   created by duplicate certificates (which are prohibited in a path by 
   X.509) before they form to allow the certification path building 
   process to continue and find valid paths.  The authors of this 
   document recommend that the loop detection not only detect the 
   repetition of a certificate in the path, but also detect the presence 
   of the same subject name / subject alternative name / subject public 
   key combination occurring twice in the path.  A name/key pair should 
   only need to appear once in the path.  
    
5.3    Use of Key Identifiers 
    
   Inconsistent and/or incompatible approaches to computing the subject 
   key identifier and authority key identifier in public key 
   certificates can cause failures in certification path building 
   algorithms that use those fields to identify certificates, even 
   though otherwise valid certification paths may exist.  Path building 
   implementations should not attempt to re-compute subject key 
   identifiers.  Rather existing key identifiers should be used, when 
   present. 
    
   Path building and processing implementations should rely on the form 
   of authority key identifier which uses the authority distinguished 
   name and serial number as a restrictive matching rule, because cross-
   certification can lead to this value not being matched by the cross 
   certificates.

   Building a certification path requires the availability of the 
   certificates and certificate revocation lists that make up the path.  
   There are many different methods for performing this retrieval.  This 
   appendix lists a few of the common ways to perform this retrieval, as 
   well as some suggested approaches for improving performance. 
    
6.1     Retrieval From Directories Using LDAP 
    
   Most applications utilize the lightweight directory access protocol 
   (LDAP) when retrieving data from directories following the X.500 
   model.  The LDAP v3 specification is found in RFC 2251. 
    
   The LDAP v3 specification defines one attribute retrieval option, the 
   "binary" option.  This option, when specified in an LDAP retrieval 
   request, was intended to force the directory to ignore any string-
   based representations of directory information, and send the 
   requested attribute(s) in binary format.  Since all PKI objects of 
   concern are binary objects, the "binary" option should be used.  
   However, not all directories support the "binary" option.  
   (Additionally, recent developments in the LDAP working group seem to 
   be leading toward the removal of the "binary" option.)  Therefore, 
   all attribute retrievals should specify the attribute name with and 
   without the "binary" option.  For example, if an application wishes 
   to retrieve the userCertificate attribute, the retrieval request 
   should contain the following list of attributes to retrieve: 
   "userCertificate, and userCertificate;binary". 
    
   The following attributes should be considered by PKI application 
   developers when performing retrievals: 
    
      - userCertificate: contains certificates issued by one or more 
        certification authorities.  This is a multi-valued attribute 
        and all values could be received and considered during path 
        building. Although typically it is expected that only end 
        entity certificates will be stored in this attribute, (e.g., 
        this is the attribute an application would request to find a 
        person's encryption certificate.) implementers may opt to 
        search this attribute when looking in CA entries to make their 
        path builder more robust.  If it is empty, the overhead added 
        by including this attribute when already requesting one or both 
        of the two below is marginal. 
         
      - cACertificate: contains self-issued certificates (if any) and 
        any certificates issued to this certification authority by 
        other certification authorities in the same realm.  (Realm is

        dependent upon local policy.) This is a multi-valued attribute 
        and all values should be received and considered during path 
        building. 
         
      - crossCertificatePair: the crossCertificatePair is used to 
        contain certificates issued to this certification authority by 
        other certification authorities in other realms, as well as 
        certificates issued by this certification authority to other 
        certification authorities in other realms.  Each attribute 
        value is a structure containing two elements.  The 
        issuedToThisCA element contains certificates issued to this 
        certification authority by other certification authorities.  
        The issuedByThisCA element contains certificates issued by this 
        certification authority to certification authorities.  Both 
        elements of the crossCertificatePair are labeled optional in 
        the ASN.1 definition; however the LDAP v2 schema states that 
        the issuedToThisCA (once called the 'forward' element) is 
        mandatory and the issuedByThisCA (once called the 'reverse' 
        element) is optional.  If both elements are present, in a 
        single value, the issuer name in one certificate must match the 
        subject name in the other and vice versa, and the subject 
        public key in one certificate shall be capable of verifying the 
        digital signature on the other certificate and vice versa. 
         
      - certificateRevocationList: the certificateRevocationList 
        attribute contains a certificate revocation list (CRL).  A CRL 
        is defined in RFC 3280 as a time stamped list identifying 
        revoked certificates, which is signed by a CA or CRL issuer and 
        made freely available in a public repository.  Each revoked 
        certificate is identified in a CRL by its certificate serial 
        number.  There may be one or more CRLs in this attribute, and 
        the values should be processed in accordance with RFC 3280. 
         
      - authorityRevocationList: the authorityRevocationList attribute 
        also contains CRLs.  These CRLs contain revocation information 
        regarding certificates issued to other CAs.  There may be one 
        or more CRLs in this attribute, and the values should be 
        processed in accordance with RFC 3280. 
    
   Certificate Processing Systems that plan to interoperate with varying 
   PKI structures and directory designs should be able to retrieve and 
   process the userCertificate, userCertificate;binary, cACertificate, 
   cACertificate;binary, crossCertificatePair, 
   crossCertificatePair;binary, certificateRevocationList, 
   certificateRevocationList;binary, authorityRevocationList, and 
   authorityRevocationList;binary attributes from directory entries.

6.2     Retrieval Using Authority Information Access 
    
   The authority information access (AIA) extension, defined within RFC 
   3280, indicates how to access CA information and services for the 
   issuer of the certificate in which the extension appears.  If a 
   certificate with an AIA extension contains an accessMethod defined 
   with the id-ad-caIssuers OID, the AIA may be used to retrieve one or 
   more certificates for entities that issued the certificate containing 
   the AIA extension.  The AIA will provide a uniform resource 
   identifier (URI) when certificates can be retrieved via LDAP, HTTP, 
   or FTP.  The AIA will provide a directoryName when certificates can 
   be retrieved via directory access protocol (DAP).  The AIA will 
   provide an rfc822Name when certificates can be retrieved via 
   electronic mail. 
    
   If present, AIA can provide path-building implementations with a 
   direct link to a certificate for the issuer of a given certificate.  
   Therefore, implementations may wish to provide support for decoding 
   the AIA extension and following the LDAP, HTTP, FTP, DAP, or e-mail 
   links.  Support for AIA is optional, RFC 3280 compliant 
   implementations need not populate the AIA extension. 
    
6.3     Retrieval Using CRL Distribution Points 
    
   The CRL distribution points (CRLDP) extension, defined within RFC 
   3280, indicates how to access CRL information.  If a CRLDP extension 
   appears within a certificate, the CRL(s) to which the CRLDP(s) refer 
   is the CRL that would contain revocation information for the 
   certificate.  The CRLDP extension may point to multiple distribution 
   points from which the CRL information may be obtained; the 
   certificate processing system should process the CRLDP extension in 
   accordance with RFC 3280.  The most common distribution points 
   contain URIs from which the appropriate CRL can be downloaded, and 
   directory names, which can be queried in a directory to retrieve the 
   CRL attributes from the corresponding entry. 
    
   If present, CRLDP can provide certificate processing implementations 
   with a link to CRL information for a given certificate.  Therefore, 
   implementations may wish to provide support for decoding the CRLDP 
   extension and using the information to retrieve CRLs.  Support for 
   CRLDP is optional and RFC3280 compliant implementations need not 
   populate the CRLDP extension.  However, implementers of path building 
   and validation modules are strongly encouraged to support CRLDPs.  At 
   a minimum, support for LDAP and HTTP should be considered; this will 
   provide for interoperability across a wide range of existing PKIs. 
    
6.4     Proprietary Retrieval Mechanisms

   Some certificate issuing systems and certificate processing systems 
   may utilize proprietary retrieval mechanisms, such as network mapped 
   drives, databases, or other methods that are not directly referenced 
   via the IETF standards.  Certificate processing systems may wish to 
   support other proprietary mechanisms, but unless functioning in a 
   closed environment should only do so in addition to supporting 
   standard retrieval mechanisms such as LDAP, AIA, and CRLDP. 
    
7.    Improving Retrieval Performance 
 
   Retrieval performance can be improved through a few different 
   mechanisms, including the use of caches and setting a specific 
   retrieval order.  This section discusses a few methods by which the 
   performance of a certificate processing system may be improved during 
   the retrieval of PKI objects.  Certificate processing systems that 
   are consistently very slow during processing will be disliked by 
   users and will be slow to be adopted into organizations.  Certificate 
   processing systems should do whatever possible to reduce the delays 
   associated with requesting and retrieving data from external sources. 
    
7.1    Caching 
    
   Certificate processing systems operating in a non-hierarchical PKI 
   will often need to retrieve certificates and certificate revocation 
   lists (CRLs) from a source outside the application protocol.  
   Typically, these objects are retrieved from an X.500 or LDAP 
   repository, an Internet URI, or some other non-local source.  Due to 
   the delays associated with both the establishing of connections as 
   well as network transfers, certificate processing systems should 
   attempt to be as efficient as possible when retrieving data from 
   external sources.  Perhaps the best way in which retrieval efficiency 
   can often be improved is by the use of a caching mechanism.  
   Certificate processing systems should cache data retrieved from 
   external sources for some period of time, but not to exceed the 
   useful period of the data (i.e., an expired certificate need not be 
   cached).  Although this comes at a cost of increased memory/disk 
   consumption by the system, the cost and performance benefit of 
   reducing network transmissions is great. 
    
   There are a number of different ways in which caching can be 
   implemented, and the specifics of these methods can be used as 
   distinguishing characteristics between certificate processing 
   systems.  However, some things that implementers may wish to consider 
   when developing caching systems are as follows: 
    
      - If PKI objects are cached, the certification path building 
        mechanism should be able to examine and retrieve from the cache 
        during path building.  This will allow the certificate 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,  
Hesse, Joseph,

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
        processing system to find or eliminate one or more paths 
        quickly without requiring external contact with a directory or 
        other mechanism. 
         
      - Sharing caches between multiple users (via a local area network 
        or LAN) may be useful if many users in one organization 
        consistently perform PKI operations with another organization. 
         
      - Caching not only PKI objects (such as certificates and CRLs) 
        but also relationships between PKI objects (storing a link 
        between a certificate and the issuer's certificate) may be 
        useful.  This linking may not always lead to the most correct 
        or best relationship, but could represent a linking that worked 
        in another scenario. 
    
7.2     Retrieval Order 
    
   To optimize efficiency, certificate processing systems should also 
   consider the order in which different PKI objects are retrieved, as 
   well as the mechanism from which they are retrieved.  If caching is 
   utilized, the caches should be consulted for PKI objects before 
   attempting other retrieval mechanisms.  If multiple caches are 
   present (such as local disk and network), the caches should be 
   consulted in the order in which they can be expected to return their 
   result, from fastest to slowest.  For example, if a certificate 
   processing system wished to retrieve a certificate with a particular 
   subject distinguished name, the system would first consult the local 
   cache, then the network cache, and then attempt directory retrieval.  
   The specifics of the types of retrieval mechanisms and their relative 
   costs are left to the implementer. 
    
   In addition to ordering retrieval mechanisms, the certificate 
   processing system should also order the relative merits of the 
   different external sources from which a PKI object can be retrieved.  
   If the AIA is present within a certificate, with a URI for the 
   issuer's certificate, the certificate processing system (if able) may 
   wish to attempt to retrieve the certificate first from local cache, 
   and then using that URI because it should point directly to the 
   desired certificate, before attempting to retrieve the many 
   certificates that may exist within a directory. 
    
   If a directory is being consulted, it may be desirable to retrieve 
   attributes in a particular order.  A highly cross-certified PKI 
   structure will lead to multiple possibilities for certification 
   paths, which may mean multiple validation attempts before a 
   successful path is retrieved.  Therefore, cACertificate and 
   userCertificate (which contain certificates from within the same 
   'realm') should be consulted before attempting to retrieve the 
 
Cooper, Dzambasow,

                     Certification Path Building        February 2003 
 
 
   crossCertificatePair values for an entry.  Ordering in this way 
   should ensure the certificate processing system attempts all possible 
   certificates within a given 'realm' before expanding the search to 
   include other 'realms'.  Alternately, all three attributes could be 
   retrieved in one query, but cross certificates then tagged as such 
   and used only after exhausting the possibilities in the local realm. 
   The best approach will depend on the nature of the application and 
   PKI environment. 
    
8.    Security Considerations 
    
   Although certificate path development deals directly with security 
   relevant PKI data, the PKI data itself needs no special handling as 
   the PKI data integrity is secured with the digital signature applied 
   to it. The only exception to this is the appropriate protection of 
   the trusted root keys and/or trusted root certificates used for 
   validating paths.  These must be kept safe and obtained out of band 
   (e.g., not from an electronic mail message or a directory.) with 
   respect to the path building module. 
    
   The greatest security risks associated with this document revolve 
   around validating while certificate paths are built.  It is therefore 
   noted here that implementers must fully implement certificate path 
   validation in accordance with RFC 3280 and X.509 in order for 
   certificate path building, certificate path validation, and the 
   certificate using application to be properly secured.  All of the 
   Security Considerations listed in Section 9 of RFC 3280 apply when 
   any aspect of path validation is done as part of path development. 
    
   In addition, as with any application that consumes data from 
   potentially untrusted network locations, path development components 
   should be carefully constructed so as to reduce or eliminate the 
   possibility of network based exploits.  For example, a poorly 
   constructed path building module may not check the length of the 
   CRLDP URI before using the C language strcpy() function to place the 
   address in a 1024 byte buffer.  A hacker could use such a flaw to 
   create a buffer overflow exploit by encoding his own code into the 
   CRLDP of a certificate and then using the certificate to attempt an 
   authentication.  Such an attack could yield system level control to 
   the attacker and expose the sensitive data the PKI was meant to 
   protect.
