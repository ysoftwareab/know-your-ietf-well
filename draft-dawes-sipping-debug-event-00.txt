Abstract

   This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event
   package for debugging.  SIP requests and responses for session setup
   can traverse a number of network entities, which might be
   geographically spread over a large area.  This document provides a
   means by which logging of requests and responses can be configured on
   a per-entity basis.

Internet-Draft             SIP Debugging Event                  May 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) RFC 3261 [RFC3261] provides all
   of the functions needed for the establishment and maintenance of
   communications sessions between users.  Registration establishes an
   address at which a user can be contacted to set up communication
   sessions.

   It is possible for that session setup might fail, for example due to
   a network fault or mis-configuration, or that poor network
   performance causes long setup delays.  In such circumstances, it is
   useful to be able to analyse SIP requests and responses end-to-end
   from the UAC to the UAS (*prd check terminology), which entails
   logging of requests and responses by entities along the signalling
   route.

   This document describes an event package that enables SIP UAs,
   proxies and B2BUAs to be dynamically configured to log SIP requests
   and responses.

   Logged signalling is identified across different entities with the
   help of a private header defined in draft-dawes-sipping-debug-id
   [draft-dawes-sipping-debug-id]

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Usage Scenarios

   This event package supplies configuration for two broad applications,
   debugging user reported faults and regression testing of a SIP
   network.

2.1.  Debugging a reported fault

   If a user is unable to set up a session using SIP, a number of causes
   are possible.  For example, the user is unable to perform
   registration, or the user terminal is forming requests incorrectly or
   a SIP proxy in the network is preventing session setup.  In such
   cases, it is useful to be able to construct a complete picture of SIP
   requests and responses related to a session, in time order.

Internet-Draft             SIP Debugging Event                  May 2008


2.2.  Regression testing

   Networks and user terminals are subject to continuous upgrading and
   modification as the software that they run is developed.  However,
   such software upgrades can have the unwanted side effect of not
   interworking with existing SIP proxies or user agents.  For software
   upgrades, either of user agents or of core network entities, it is
   useful to perform a set of regression tests after an upgrade and
   compare signalling logged before and after the upgrade.


3.  Principle of Operation

   Debugging can be understood by the simple state machine below, which
   applies to any SIP UA or Proxy.

                              | Logging    |

   schema in this document.  Supply of configuration causes debugging
   state to change from Inactive to Active.  Configuration defines one
   or more start trigger events, which cause debugging state to change
   from Active to Logging when they are detected.  A start trigger event
   is typically a user identity, in the SIP From: or To: header field,
   plus a 6-digit hexadecimal reference number.  Similarly,
   configuration contains one or more stop triggering events, which
   cause debugging state to change from Logging to Active when they are
   detected.  A stop trigger event is typically the expiry of a timer or
   the end of a SIP session.

3.1.  Minimum debugging configuration

   In order to uniquely identify signalling logged at different entities
   as belonging to the same session, the minimum set of debugging
   configuration is a <user-id> element and a <debug-id> element.


4.  Package Definition

   This section fills in the details needed to specify an event package
   as defined in Section 4.4 of RFC 3265 [RFC3265].

4.1.  Event Package Name

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to specify
   the name of their package or template-package.

   The name of this package is "debug".  As specified in RFC 3265
   [RFC3265], this value appears in the Event header present in
   SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests.

   Example:

   Event: debug

4.2.  Event Package Parameters

   The SIP Events specification requires package and template-package
   definitions to specify any package specific parameters of the Event
   header that are used by it.

   No package specific Event header parameters are defined for this
   event package.

Internet-Draft             SIP Debugging Event                  May 2008


4.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package or template-package
   definitions to define the usage, if any, of bodies in SUBSCRIBE
   requests.

   A SUBSCRIBE for debug events MAY contain a body.  This body would
   serve the purpose of filtering the subscription.  The definition of
   such a body is outside the scope of this specification.

   A SUBSCRIBE for the debug package MAY be sent without a body.  This
   implies that the default registration filtering policy has been
   requested.  The default policy is:

   o  Notifications are generated every time there is any change in the
      state of any part of the debug configuration for the resource
      being subscribed to.  Those notifications only contain information
      on the configuration elements whose state has changed.

   o  Notifications triggered from a SUBSCRIBE contain full state (all
      debug configuration bound to the address-of-record).  Of course,
      the server can apply any policy it likes to the subscription.

4.4.  Subscription Duration

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to define a
   default value for subscription durations, and to discuss reasonable
   choices for durations when they are explicitly specified.

   Debug configuration state changes as the need for debugging arises,
   either to investigate a user-reported fault or perform regression
   testing.  The debug configuration for a user or users is updated by
   administrative means.

   Since configuration of debugging will be followed quickly by the
   debugging itself, the default duration of subscriptions to debug
   configuration is 43200 seconds.  Of course, clients MAY include an
   Expires header in the SUBSCRIBE request asking for a different
   duration.

4.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to describe
   the allowed set of body types in NOTIFY requests, and to specify the
   default value to be used when there is no Accept header in the
   SUBSCRIBE request.

   The body of a notification of a change in debug configuration state

Internet-Draft             SIP Debugging Event                  May 2008


   contains a debug configuration information document.  This document
   describes some or all of the debugging configuration associated with
   a particular address-of-record.  All subscribers and notifiers MUST
   support the "application/debuginfo+xml" format described in Section
   5.  The subscribe request MAY contain an Accept header field.  If no
   such header field is present, it has a default value of "application/
   debuginfo+xml".  If the header field is present, it MUST include
   "application/debuginfo+xml", and MAY include any other types capable
   of representing debugging information.

   Of course, the notifications generated by the server MUST be in one
   of the formats specified in the Accept header field in the SUBSCRIBE
   request.

4.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   The SIP Events framework specifies that packages should define any
   package-specific processing of SUBSCRIBE requests at a notifier,
   specifically with regards to authentication and authorization.

   Debug configuration can be sensitive information.  Therefore, all
   subscriptions to it SHOULD be authenticated and authorized before
   approval.  Authentication MAY be performed using any of the
   techniques available through SIP, including digest, S/MIME, TLS or
   other transport specific mechanisms RFC3261 [RFC3261].  Authorization
   policy is at the discretion of the administrator, as always.
   However, a few recommendations can be made.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a user be allowed to subscribe to their own
   debug configuration state.  Debugging relies upon a user agent
   including a network-provided debug-id, and this is most easily
   provided by allowing the user to subscribe to debug-event.  We also
   anticipate that applications and automata will frequently be
   subscribers to the debug configuration state.  In those cases,
   authorization policy will typically be provided ahead of time.

4.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   The SIP Event framework requests that packages specify the conditions
   under which notifications are sent for that package, and how such
   notifications are constructed.

   To determine when a notifier should send notifications of changes in
   debug configuration state, we define a finite state machine (FSM)
   that represents the state of debug configuration for a particular
   address-of-record.

   Transitions in this state machine MAY result in the generation of



Dawes                   Expires November 4, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             SIP Debugging Event                  May 2008


   notifications.  These notifications will carry information on the new
   state and the event which triggered the state change.  It is
   important to note that this FSM is just a model of the debug
   configuration state machinery maintained by a server.  An
   implementation would map its own state machines to this one in an
   implementation-specific manner.

4.7.1.  The Debug Configuration State Machine

   The underlying state machine for debug configuration is shown in the
   figure below.  The machine is very simple.  An instance of this
   machine is associated with each address-of-record.  When there is no
   debugging configuration defined for an address-of-record, the state
   machine is in the init state.  It is important to note that this
   state machine exists, and is well-defined, for each address-of-record
   in the domain, even if there is no debug configuration defined for
   it.  This allows a user agent to subscribe to an address-of-record,
   and learn that there is no debug configuration for it.  When debug
   configuration is added for that address-of-record, the state machine
   moves from init to active.

                              +------------+
                              |            |
                              |    Init    |
                              |            |
                              +------------+
                                     |
                                     V
                              +------------+
                              |            |
                              |   Active   |
                              |            |
                              +------------+
                                     |
                                     V
                              +------------+
                              |            |
                              | Terminated |
                              |            |
                              +------------+

               Figure 2: Debug Congfiguration State Machine

   As long as there is debugging configuration for the address-of-
   record, the state machine remains in the active state.  When the last
   debug configuration expires or is removed, the debug configuration
   transitions to terminated.  From there, it immediately transitions
   back to the init state.  This transition is invisible, in that it

Internet-Draft             SIP Debugging Event                  May 2008


   MUST NOT ever be reported to a subscriber in a NOTIFY request.

   This allows for an implementation optimization whereby the registrar
   can destroy the objects associated with the debug configuration state
   machine once it enters the terminated state and a NOTIFY has been
   sent.  Instead, the registrar can assume that, if the objects for
   that state machine no longer exist, the state machine is in the init
   state.

4.7.2.  Applying the State Machine

   The server MAY generate a notification to subscribers when any event
   occurs in the debug configuration state machine, except for the
   transition from terminated to init.  As noted above, a notification
   MUST NOT be sent in this case.  For other transitions, whether the
   server sends a notification or not is policy dependent.  However,
   several guidelines are defined.

4.8.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   The SIP Events framework expects packages to specify how a subscriber
   processes NOTIFY requests in any package specific ways, and in
   particular, how it uses the NOTIFY requests to construct a coherent
   view of the state of the subscribed resource.  For debug
   configuration, the NOTIFY will contain all information for the
   address of record whose configuration has changed.

4.9.  Handling of Forked Requests

   The SIP Events framework mandates that packages indicate whether or
   not forked SUBSCRIBE requests can install multiple subscriptions.

   Debug configuration is normally stored in some repository (whether it
   be co-located with a proxy/registrar or in a separate database).  As
   such, there is usually a single place where the debug configuration
   information for a particular address-of-record is resident.  This
   implies that a subscription for this information is readily handled
   by a single element with access to this repository.  There is,
   therefore, no compelling need for a subscription to debug
   configuration information to fork.  As a result, a subscriber MUST
   NOT create multiple dialogs as a result of a single subscription
   request.  The required processing to guarantee that only a single
   dialog is established is described in Section 4.4.9 of the SIP Events
   framework RFC3265 [RFC3265].

4.10.  Rate of Notifications

   The SIP Events framework mandates that packages define a maximum rate
   of notifications for their package.

   For reasons of congestion control, it is important that the rate of
   notifications not become excessive.  A change of debug configuration
   is usually followed by a session to be debugged, which takes
   significant time.  Even during regression testing, in which a number
   of consecutive sessions might be debugged, notifications are
   punctuated by the sessions or standalone transactions to be debugged.
   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the server not generate

4.11.  State Agents

   The SIP Events framework asks packages to consider the role of state
   agents in their design.

   Debug configuration information is passed from a network management
   server to the SIP registrar, which hosts the debug configuration
   event package.  The details of how debug configuration information is
   passed to the SIP registrar is outside the scope of this document.


5.  Debug Configuration Information

5.1.  Structure of Debug Configuration

   Debug configuration is an XML document Canonical XML Version 1.0
   [W3C.xml-c14n] that MUST be well-formed and SHOULD be valid.  Debug
   configuration documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded
   using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of XML namespaces for
   identifying debug configuration documents and document fragments.
   The namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a URN
   RFC 2141 [RFC2141], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by
   RFC 2648 [RFC2648] and extended by RFC 3688 [RFC3688];.  This URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:debuginfo

   A debug configuration document begins with the root element tag
   "debuginfo".  It consists of any number of "debugconfig" sub-
   elements, each of which contains descriptions of sessions or
   standalone transactions that are to be debugged for a particular
   address-of-record.  The debug configuration information for a
   particular address-of-record MUST be contained within a single
   "debuginfo" element; it cannot be spread across multiple "debuginfo"

   elements within a document.  Other elements from different namespaces
   MAY be present for the purposes of extensibility; elements or
   attributes from unknown namespaces MUST be ignored.  There are two
   attributes associated with the "debuginfo" element, both of which
   MUST be present:

             version: This attribute allows the recipient of debug
             configuration documents to properly order them.  Versions
             start at 0, and increment by one for each new document sent
             to a subscriber.  Versions are scoped within a
             subscription.  Versions MUST be representable using a 32
             bit integer.

             state: This attribute indicates whether the document
             contains the full registration state, or whether it
             contains only information on those debug configurations
             which have changed since the previous document (partial).

   Note that the document format explicitly allows for conveying
   information on multiple addresses-of-record.  This enables
   subscriptions to groups of debug configurations, where such a group
   is identified by some kind of URI.  For example, a domain might
   define sip:allusers@example.com as a resource that can be subscribed
   to and generates notifications when the state of any address-of-
   record in the domain changes.

   The "debugconfig" element has a list of any number of "session" sub-
   elements, each of which contains information on a single session or
   standalone transaction.  Other elements from different namespaces MAY
   be present for the purposes of extensibility; elements or attributes
   from unknown namespaces MUST be ignored.  There are three attributes
   associated with the "debug configuration" element, all of which MUST
   be present:

             aor: The aor attribute contains a URI which is the address-
             of-record this registration refers to.

             id: The id attribute identifies this debug configuration.
             It MUST be unique amongst all other id attributes present
             in other debug configuration elements conveyed to the
             subscriber within the scope of their subscription.  In
             particular, if two URI identifying an address-of-record
             differ after their canonicalization according to the
             procedures in step 5 of Section 10.3 of RFC 3261 [RFC3261],
             the id attributes in the "debug configuration" elements for
             those addresses-of-record MUST differ.  Furthermore, the id
             attribute for a "debug configuration" element for a
             particular address-of-record MUST be the same across all

             notifications sent within the subscription.

             state: The state attribute indicates the state of the debug
             configuration.  The valid values are "init", "active" and
             "terminated".

   The "session" element contains a "debug-id" element and a "start
   trigger" element, "stop trigger" element, and "control" element.
   Other elements from different namespaces MAY be present for the
   purposes of extensibility; elements or attributes from unknown
   namespaces MUST be ignored.  There is one attribute associated with
   the "session" element which MUST be present:

             id: The "id" attribute identifies this session.  It MUST be
             unique amongst all other id attributes present in other
             debug configuration elements conveyed to the subscriber
             within the scope of their subscription.

5.2.  Computing Debug Configuration from the Document

   Typically, the NOTIFY for debug configuration information will only
   contain information about those sessions whose state has changed.  To
   construct a coherent view of the total state of all registrations, a
   subscriber will need to combine NOTIFYs received over time.  The
   subscriber maintains a table for each debug configuration it receives
   information for.  Each debug configuration is uniquely identified by
   the "id" attribute in the "debug configuration" element.  Each table
   contains a row for each session in that debug configuration.  Each
   row is indexed by the unique debug-id for that session.  It is
   conveyed in the "id" attribute of the "session" element.  The tables
   are also associated with a version number.  The version number MUST
   be initialized with the value of the "version" attribute from the
   "debuginfo" element in the first document received.  Each time a new
   document is received, the value of the local version number, and the
   "version" attribute in the new document, are compared.  If the value
   in the new document is one higher than the local version number, the
   local version number is increased by one, and the document is
   processed.  If the value in the document is more than one higher than
   the local version number, the local version number is set to the
   value in the new document, the document is processed, and the
   subscriber SHOULD generate a refresh request to trigger a full state
   notification.  If the value in the document is less than the local
   version, the document is discarded without processing.

   The processing of the document depends on whether it contains full or
   partial state.  If it contains full state, indicated by the value of
   the "state" attribute in the "debuginfo" element, the contents of all
   tables associated with this subscription are flushed.  They are re-

   populated from the document.  A new table is created for each
   "debugconfig" element, and a new row in each table is created for
   each "session" element.  If the debuginfo contains partial state, as
   indicated by the value of the "state" attribute in the "debuginfo"
   element, the document is used to update the existing tables.  For
   each "debugconfig" element, the subscriber checks to see if a table
   exists for that debug configuration.  This check is done by comparing
   the value in the "aor" attribute of the "debugconfig" element with
   the aor associated with the table.  If a table doesn't exist for that
   registration, one is created.  For each "session" element in the
   debug configuration, the subscriber checks to see whether a row
   exists for that session.  This check is done by comparing the ID in
   the "id" attribute of the "session" element with the ID associated
   with the row.  If the session doesn't exist in the table, a row is
   added, and its state is set to the information from that "session"
   element.  If the session does exist, its state is updated to be the
   information from that "session" element.  If a row is updated or
   created, such that its state is now terminated, that entry MAY be
   removed from the table at any time.

5.3.  Example

   The following is an example debug configuration information document:

         <?xml version="1.0"?>
         <debuginfo xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:debuginfo"
           version="0" state="full">

The XML documents for the user agent and the proxy may be different. In
this example, the value in the &lt;debug-d&gt;.element is identical for
the user agent and the proxy, but for the proxy it is part of the start
trigger event, whereas for the user agent it is control information


6.2.  Incoming session

   In order to log signalling for the incoming session shown below, it
   is necessary to configure debugging on the registrar, proxy, and user
   agent.  The P-Debug-ID private header shown in the figure below is
   defined in draft-dawes-sipping-debug-id
   [draft-dawes-sipping-debug-id]

Internet-Draft             SIP Debugging Event                  May 2008


   The registrar r1.atlanta.com is triggered to begin logging signalling
   by a start trigger event of the INVITE method and the value
   alice@atlanta.com in the To: header field.  The debugging
   configuration in the registrar is shown below.

         <?xml version="1.0"?>
         <debuginfo xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:debuginfo"
           version="0" state="full">
           <debugconfig aor="alice@atlanta.com" id="r01" state="active"
               expires="10000">
           <session id="r03">
             <start-trigger>
               <method>INVITE</method>
               <to>alice@atlanta.com</to>
             </start-trigger>
             <stop-trigger>
               <reason>dialog-established</reason>
             </stop-trigger>
             <control>
               <trace-depth>minimum</trace-depth>
               <debug-id>BB947A</debug-id>
             </control>
           </session>
          </debugconfig>
         </debuginfo>

   The registrar detects an INVITE request with "alice@atlanta.com" in
   the To: header field.  The registrar therefore starts logging and
   adds a P-Debug-ID header field containing the value in the
   <debug-id/> element in its debugging configuration.The registrar then
   forwards the request.

   The debugging configuration in the proxy is shown below.

           </session>
          </debugconfig>
         </debuginfo>

   The request arriving at the proxy matches the values configured in
   its <start-trigger> element: a P-Debug-ID header containing the
   configured value and "alice@atlanta.com" in the To: header field.
   The proxy therefore starts logging and forwards the request.

   The User Agent has the same <start-trigger> element as the proxy and
   therefore starts logging.  The user agent copies the P-Debug-ID
   header field into the 200 OK response.

   The User Agent, proxy and registrar all have the same <stop-trigger>
   element, and logging will stop as the 200 OK passes each entity,
   thereby establishing the dialog.

6.3.  Outgoing session

   In order to log signalling for the outgoing session shown below, it
   is necessary to configure debugging on the registrar, proxy, and user
   agent.

   The user agent detects the configured start trigger event when it

   P-Debug-ID header field containing the value in the <debug-id/>
   element in its debugging configuration <control/> element.  The user
   agent then forwards the request.

   The debugging configuration in the proxy is shown below.

   The request arriving at the proxy matches the values configured in
   its <start-trigger> element: a P-Debug-ID header containing the
   configured value and "alice@atlanta.com" in the From: header field.
   The proxy therefore starts logging and forwards the request.

   The registrar has the same <start-trigger> element as the proxy and
   therefore starts logging and forwards the request.

   The User Agent, proxy and registrar all have the same <stop-trigger>
   element, and logging will stop after a time duration of 7 minutes 30
   seconds.

6.4.  Prompting a user agent to subscribe to debug-event

   Troubleshooting and regression testing will be quite rare events and
   only involve specific entities, therefore it is inefficient for all
   user agents to be subscribed to the debug event package all the time.
   A user agent can be prompted to subscribe to its own debug event
   package by an empty P-Debug-ID header field in a 200 OK response to a
   REGISTER request.  The signalling is shown below.
