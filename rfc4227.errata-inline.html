Abstract

   This memo specifies a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) binding to
   the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) core.  A SOAP binding
   describes how SOAP messages are transmitted in the network.

   The SOAP is an XML-based (eXtensible Markup Language) messaging
   protocol used to implement a wide variety of distributed messaging
   models.  It defines a message format and describes a variety of
   message patterns, including, but not limited to, Remote Procedure
   Calling (RPC), asynchronous event notification, unacknowledged
   messages, and forwarding via SOAP intermediaries.

1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies how SOAP envelopes [15] are transmitted using a
   BEEP profile [1].  Conforming implementations MUST support SOAP
   version 1.2 [15] and MAY support other versions, such as SOAP version
   1.1 [17].  This memo specifies how SOAP envelopes [15] are
   transmitted using a BEEP profile [1].  Unlike its predecessor,
   RFC3288 [16], this memo does not mandate the use of SOAP version 1.1.

   Throughout this memo, the term &quot;envelope&quot; refers to the top-level
   element exchanged by SOAP senders and receivers.  For example, when
   referring to SOAP version 1.2, the term &quot;envelope&quot; refers to the
   &quot;Envelope&quot; element defined in Section 5.1 of [2].  Furthermore, the
   terms &quot;peer&quot;, &quot;client&quot;, &quot;server&quot;, &quot;one-to-one&quot;, and &quot;one-to-many&quot; are
   used in the context of BEEP.  In particular, Sections 2.1 and 2.1.1
   of [1] discuss BEEP roles and exchange styles.

2.  BEEP Profile Identification

   The BEEP profile for SOAP is identified as

       http://iana.org/beep/soap/VERSION

   in the BEEP &quot;profile&quot; element during channel creation. where
   &quot;VERSION&quot; refers to the numeric version of the SOAP specification.

   For example,

       http://iana.org/beep/soap/1.2

   refers to version 1.2.

   Note that RFC 3288 [16] used

       http://iana.org/beep/soap

   for the purposes of profile identification for SOAP version 1.1
   envelopes [17].  If an implementation of this memo chooses to
   implement SOAP version 1.1, then it should support both this Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) for profile identification as well as
   &quot;http://iana.org/beep/soap/1.1&quot;.

   In BEEP, when the first channel is successfully created, the
   &quot;serverName&quot; attribute in the &quot;start&quot; element identifies the &quot;virtual
   host&quot; associated with the peer acting in the server role, e.g.,
       &lt;start number=&#x27;1&#x27; serverName=&#x27;stockquoteserver.example.com&#x27;&gt;
           &lt;profile uri=&#x27;http://iana.org/beep/soap/1.2&#x27; /&gt;
       &lt;/start&gt;

   The &quot;serverName&quot; attribute is analogous to HTTP&#x27;s &quot;Host&quot; request-
   header field (cf. Section 14.23 of [4]).

   There are two states in the BEEP profile for SOAP, &quot;boot&quot; and
   &quot;ready&quot;:

   o  In the &quot;boot&quot; state, the peer requesting the creation of the
      channel sends a &quot;bootmsg&quot; (either during channel initialization or
      in a &quot;MSG&quot; message).

      *  If the other peer sends a &quot;bootrpy&quot; (either during channel
         initialization or in an &quot;RPY&quot; message), then the &quot;ready&quot; state
         is entered

      *  Otherwise, the other peer sends an &quot;error&quot; (either during
         channel initialization or in an &quot;ERR&quot; message), then no state
         change occurs.

   o  In the &quot;ready&quot; state, either peer begins a SOAP message pattern by
      sending a &quot;MSG&quot; message containing an envelope.  The other peer
      completes the message pattern either by

      *  sending back an &quot;RPY&quot; message containing an envelope or

      *  sending back zero or more &quot;ANS&quot; messages, each containing an
         envelope, followed by a &quot;NUL&quot; message.

      Regardless, no state change occurs.

2.1.  Profile Initialization

   The boot message is used for two purposes:

      resource identification: each channel bound to the BEEP profile
      for SOAP provides access to a single resource (a network data
      object or service).

      feature negotiation: if new features of SOAP (such as compression)
      emerge, their use can be negotiated.

   The DTD syntax for the boot message and its response are:

       &lt;!ELEMENT bootmsg     EMPTY&gt;
       &lt;!ATTLIST bootmsg
                 resource    CDATA             #REQUIRED
                 features    NMTOKENS          &quot;&quot;&gt;

       &lt;!ELEMENT bootrpy     EMPTY&gt;
       &lt;!ATTLIST bootrpy
                 features    NMTOKENS          &quot;&quot;&gt;

   The boot message contains a mandatory and an optional attribute:

   o  the &quot;resource&quot; attribute, which is analogous to HTTP&#x27;s &quot;abs_path&quot;
      Request-URI parameter (cf. Section 5.1.2 of [4]) and

   o  the &quot;features&quot; attribute, which, if present, contains one or more
      feature tokens, each indicating an optional feature of the BEEP
      profile for SOAP that is being requested for possible use over the
      channel.

   Section 7.1 defines a registration template for optional features.

   If the peer acting in the server role recognizes the requested
   resource, it replies with the boot response that contains one
   optional attribute:

   o  The &quot;features&quot; attribute, if present, contains a subset of the
      feature tokens in the boot message, indicating which features may
      be used over the channel.  (If not present or empty, then no
      features may be used.)

   Otherwise, if the boot message is improperly formed, or if the
   requested resource is not recognized, the peer acting in the server
   role replies with an error message (cf. Section 7.1 of [1]).
   Typically, the boot message and its response are exchanged during
   channel initialization (cf. Section 2.3.1.2 of [1]).

   For example, here the boot message and its response are exchanged
   during channel initialization:

       C: &lt;start number=&#x27;1&#x27; serverName=&#x27;stockquoteserver.example.com&#x27;&gt;
       C:     &lt;profile uri=&#x27;http://iana.org/beep/soap/1.2&#x27;&gt;
       C:         &lt;![CDATA[&lt;bootmsg resource=&#x27;/StockQuote&#x27; /&gt;]]&gt;
       C:     &lt;/profile&gt;
       C: &lt;/start&gt;

       S: &lt;profile uri=&#x27;http://iana.org/beep/soap/1.2&#x27;&gt;
       S:     &lt;![CDATA[&lt;bootrpy /&gt;]]&gt;
       S: &lt;/profile&gt;

   The channel bound to the BEEP profile for SOAP is now in the &quot;ready&quot;
   state.

   Alternatively, here is an example in which the boot exchange is
   unsuccessful:

       C: &lt;start number=&#x27;1&#x27; serverName=&#x27;stockquoteserver.example.com&#x27;&gt;
       C:     &lt;profile uri=&#x27;http://iana.org/beep/soap/1.2&#x27;&gt;
       C:         &lt;![CDATA[&lt;bootmsg resource=&#x27;/StockPick&#x27; /&gt;]]&gt;
       C:     &lt;/profile&gt;
       C: &lt;/start&gt;

       S: &lt;profile uri=&#x27;http://iana.org/beep/soap/1.2&#x27;&gt;
       S:     &lt;![CDATA[&lt;error code=&#x27;550&#x27;&gt;resource not
       S:                                supported&lt;/error&gt;]]&gt;
       S: &lt;/profile&gt;

   Although the channel was created successfully, it remains in the
   &quot;boot&quot; state.

3.  SOAP Message Packages

   The BEEP profile for SOAP transmits envelopes encoded as UTF-8 and
   SHOULD use the media type &quot;application/soap+xml&quot; [5], e.g.,


   MSG 1 1 . 0 284
   Content-Type: application/soap+xml

   &lt;env:Envelope
        xmlns:env=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot;&gt;
     &lt;env:Header&gt;
      &lt;m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m=&quot;Some-URI&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;/env:Header&gt;
     &lt;env:Body&gt;
       &lt;symbol xmlns:p=&quot;Some-URI&quot; &gt;DIS&lt;/symbol&gt;
     &lt;/env:Body&gt;
   &lt;/env:Envelope&gt;
   END

   To provide compatibility with RFC 3288 [16], it MAY use the media
   type &quot;application/xml&quot; [6].

   In addition, an implementation of the BEEP profile for SOAP MAY
   support transmission of envelopes using the MTOM [7] / XOP [8]
   packaging technique, e.g.,

   MSG 1 2 . 283 1436
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Content-Type: Multipart/Related;boundary=MIME_boundary;
       type=&quot;application/xop+xml&quot;;
       start=&quot;&lt;mymessage.xml@example.org&gt;&quot;;
       startinfo=&quot;application/soap+xml; action=
   Content-Description: A SOAP message with my pic and sig in it

   --MIME_boundary
   Content-Type: application/xop+xml;
       charset=UTF-8;
       type=&quot;application/soap+xml; action=
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
   Content-ID: &lt;mymessage.xml@example.org&gt;

   &lt;soap:Envelope
       xmlns:soap=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&#x27;
       xmlns:xmlmime=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2004/11/xmlmime&#x27;&gt;
     &lt;soap:Body&gt;
       &lt;m:data xmlns:m=&#x27;http://example.org/stuff&#x27;&gt;
         &lt;m:photo
     xmlmime:contentType=&#x27;image/png&#x27;&gt;&lt;xop:Include
       xmlns:xop=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2004/08/xop/include&#x27;
       href=&#x27;cid:http://example.org/me.png&#x27;/&gt;&lt;/m:photo&gt;
         &lt;m:sig
     xmlmime:contentType=&#x27;application/pkcs7-signature&#x27;&gt;&lt;xop:Include
       xmlns:xop=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2004/08/xop/include&#x27;
       href=&#x27;cid:http://example.org/my.hsh&#x27;/&gt;&lt;/m:sig&gt;
       &lt;/m:data&gt;
     &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
   &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;

   --MIME_boundary
   Content-Type: image/png
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
   Content-ID: &lt;http://example.org/me.png&gt;

   // binary octets for png

   --MIME_boundary
   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-signature
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
   Content-ID: &lt;http://example.org/my.hsh&gt;

   // binary octets for signature

   --MIME_boundary--
   END

   Consult Section 4.1 of XOP [8] for guidance on MIME Multipart/Related
   usage.  Because BEEP provides an 8-bit-wide path, a &quot;transformative&quot;
   Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g., &quot;base64&quot; or &quot;quoted-printable&quot;)
   should not be used.  Note that MIME [9] requires that the value of
   the &quot;Content-ID&quot; header be globally unique.  As stated in Section 4
   of XOP [8], XOP may be used with diverse packaging mechanisms.  When
   an implementation of BEEP in SOAP does support MTOM/XOP, it SHOULD
   support the MIME Multipart/Related XOP Package format, and MAY
   support others.  Additional formats could, in the future, include XOP
   package formats specific to BEEP (e.g., sending the attachments on a
   different channel to the SOAP channel, which would avoid searching
   for the MIME boundary tags and allows lazy delivery of attachments,
   delivering them only when really needed.)

4.  SOAP Message Patterns

4.1.  One-Way Message

   A one-way message involves sending a message without any response
   being returned.

   The BEEP profile for SOAP achieves this using a one-to-many exchange,
   in which the client sends a &quot;MSG&quot; message containing an envelope, and
   the server immediately sends back a &quot;NUL&quot; message, before processing
   the contents of the envelope.

4.2.  Request-Response Exchange

   A request/response exchange involves sending a request, which results
   in a response being returned.

   The BEEP profile for SOAP achieves this using a one-to-one exchange,
   in which the client sends a &quot;MSG&quot; message containing an envelope, and
   the server sends back a &quot;RPY&quot; message containing an envelope.

4.3.  Request/N-Responses Exchange

   A request/N-responses exchange involves sending a request, which
   results in zero or more responses being returned.

   The BEEP profile for SOAP achieves this using a one-to-many exchange,
   in which the client sends a &quot;MSG&quot; message containing an envelope, and
   the server sends back zero or more &quot;ANS&quot; messages, each containing an
   envelope, followed by a &quot;NUL&quot; message.

4.4.  Error Handling

   The BEEP profile for SOAP does not use the &quot;ERR&quot; message for SOAP
   faults.  When performing one-to-one exchanges, whatever SOAP response
   (including SOAP faults) generated by the server is always returned in
   the &quot;RPY&quot; message.  When performing one-to-many exchanges, whatever
   SOAP response (including SOAP faults) generated by the server is
   always returned in the &quot;ANS&quot; messages.

   If there is an error with the BEEP message unrelated to the SOAP
   envelope (e.g., poorly formed MIME message or MIME Content-Type not
   supported), then the server responds with an ERR message (see Section
   7.1 of [1]) with an appropriate reply code (e.g., see Section 8 of
   [1]).

5.  SOAP Protocol Binding Framework Conformance

5.1.  Binding Name

   This binding is identified by a URI that is exactly the same as the
   profile URI for BEEP in SOAP (see Section 2).

5.2.  Base URI

   The Base URI for the SOAP envelope is the URI of the resource
   identified in the bootmsg.

5.3.  Supported SOAP Message Exchange Patterns

   An implementation of this binding MUST support the following SOAP
   Message Exchange Pattern (MEP):

   o  &quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/mep/request-response/&quot; (see
      Section 6.2 of [3])

5.4.  Supported Features

   An implementation of this binding MAY support the following feature:
   &quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/features/action/&quot; (see Section 6.5 of
   [3].)

5.5.  MEP Operation

   For binding instances conforming to this specification:

   o  A SOAP node instantiated at the BEEP peer that initiates the
      message exchange may assume the role (i.e., the property http://
      www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindingFramework/ExchangeContext/Role ) of
      &quot;RequestingSOAPNode&quot;.

   o  A SOAP node instantiated at the other BEEP peer may assume the
      role (i.e., the property http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/
      bindingFramework/ExchangeContext/Role) of &quot;RespondingSOAPNode&quot;.

5.5.1.  Behavior of Requesting SOAP Node

   The overall flow of the behavior of a requesting SOAP node follows a
   state machine description consistent with Section 6.2 of [3].

   In order to avoid deadlock during streaming (see Section 6.2.3 of
   [3]), the requesting SOAP node MUST be able to process incoming SOAP
   response information while the SOAP request is still being
   transmitted.

5.5.1.1.  Init

   In the &quot;Init&quot; state, a BEEP message is formulated according to
   Section 3, transmission of the message begins, and then the state
   changes to &quot;Requesting&quot;.

5.5.1.2.  Requesting

   In the &quot;Requesting&quot; state, more of the request message is transmitted
   and the arrival of the response is awaited.  When the beginning of
   the response message is received, if it is a BEEP ERR message, then
   the state transitions to &quot;Fail&quot;; otherwise, the state transitions to
   &quot;Sending+Receiving&quot;.

5.5.1.3.  Sending+Receiving

   In the &quot;Sending+Receiving&quot; state, the transmission of the request
   message and receiving of the response message are completed.  The
   response message is assumed to contain a SOAP envelope serialized
   according to the rules for carrying SOAP messages in the media type
   given in the Content-Type header field.  Once the receipt of the
   response is completed, the state transitions to &quot;Success&quot;.

5.5.1.4.  Success and Fail

   &quot;Success&quot; and &quot;Fail&quot; are the terminal states for the state machine.

5.5.2.  Behavior of Responding SOAP Node

   The overall flow of the behavior of a responding SOAP node follows a
   state machine description consistent with Section 6.2 of [3]

5.5.2.1.  Init

   In the &quot;Init&quot; state, the binding awaits the start of the inbound
   request.  In this state, it may only generate ERR messages (in
   accordance with Section 4.4).

5.5.2.2.  Receiving

   The binding begins to receive the request message and prepares the
   start of the response, in accordance with Section 3.  When ready to
   transmit the response, the state transitions to &quot;Receiving+Sending&quot;.

5.5.2.3.  Receiving+Sending

   The binding completes the receiving of the request and sending of the
   response and then transitions to &quot;Success&quot; state.

5.5.2.4.  Success and Fail

   &quot;Success&quot; and &quot;Fail&quot; are the terminal states that indicate completion
   of the message exchange.

6.  URL Schemes

   This memo defines two URL schemes, &quot;soap.beep&quot; and &quot;soap.beeps&quot;,
   which identify the use of SOAP over BEEP over TCP.  Note that, at
   present, a &quot;generic&quot; URL scheme for SOAP is not defined.

6.1.  The soap.beep URL Scheme

   The &quot;soap.beep&quot; URL scheme uses the &quot;generic URI&quot; syntax defined in
   Section 3 of [10], specifically:

   o  the value &quot;soap.beep&quot; is used for the scheme component and

   o  the server-based naming authority defined in Section 3.2.2 of [10]
      is used for the authority component.

   o  the path component maps to the &quot;resource&quot; component of the boot
      message sent during profile initialization (if absent, it defaults
      to &quot;/&quot;).

   The values of both the scheme and authority components are case-
   insensitive.

   For example, the URL

       soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com/StockQuote

   might result in the example shown in Section 2.1.

6.1.1.  Resolving IP/TCP Address Information

   The &quot;soap.beep&quot; URL scheme indicates the use of the BEEP profile for
   SOAP running over TCP/IP.

   <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-699'>     If the authority component contains a domain name and a port number, <button id="btn_699" target="expand_699" onclick='hideFunction("expand_699")'>Expand</button>
     e.g.,

       	soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com:1026

     then the DNS is queried for the Address Records (i.e. &quot;A&quot; for
     IPv4, &quot;AAAA&quot; for IPv6 based on the host resolver specifications) 
     corresponding to the domain name, and the port number is used directly.

     If the authority component contains a domain name and no port number,
     e.g.,

           soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com

     the Service Record algorithm [11] is used with a service parameter of
     &quot;soap-beep&quot; and a protocol parameter of &quot;tcp&quot; to determine the IP/TCP
     addressing information.  If no appropriate SRV RRs are found (e.g.,
     for &quot;_soap-beep._tcp.stockquoteserver.example.com&quot;), then the DNS is
     queried for the Address RRs corresponding to the domain name     
     and the port number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration
     in Section 8.4.</span id__locate=699>

   If the authority component contains an IP address, e.g.,

       soap.beep://192.0.2.0:1026

   then the DNS is not queried, and the IP address is used directly.  If
   a port number is present, it is used directly; otherwise, the port
   number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration in Section
   8.4.

   While the use of literal IPv6 addresses in URLs is discouraged, if a
   literal IPv6 address is used in a &quot;soap.beep&quot; URL, it must conform to
   the syntax specified in [12].

6.2.  The soap.beeps URL Scheme

   The &quot;soap.beeps&quot; URL scheme is identical, in all ways, to the
   &quot;soap.beep&quot; URL scheme specified in Section 6.1, with the exception
   that prior to starting the BEEP profile for SOAP, the BEEP session
   must be tuned for privacy.  In particular, note that both URL schemes
   use the identical algorithms and parameters for address resolution as
   specified in Section 6.1.1 (e.g., the same service name for SRV
   lookups, the same port number for TCP, and so on).

   There are two ways to perform privacy tuning on a BEEP session,
   either

   o  a transport security profile may be successfully started or

   o  a user authentication profile that supports transport security may
      be successfully started.

   Regardless, upon completion of the negotiation process, a tuning
   reset occurs in which both BEEP peers issue a new greeting.  Consult
   Section 3 of [1] for an example of how a BEEP peer may choose to
   issue different greetings based on whether privacy is in use.

   Furthermore, implementations may choose to offer MIME-based security
   services providing message integrity and confidentiality, such as
   OpenPGP [13] or S/MIME [14].

   Regardless, consult [1]&#x27;s Section 9 for a discussion of BEEP-specific
   security issues.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Previously, the IANA registered &quot;http://iana.org/beep/soap&quot; for use
   with RFC 3288 [16].  This memo requires that the IANA register a
   URI-prefix of

       http://iana.org/beep/soap/VERSION

   to correspond to the family of profiles defined Section 8.1.

   The IANA has registered &quot;soap.beep&quot; and &quot;soap.beeps&quot; as URL schemes,
   as specified in Section 8.2 and Section 8.3, respectively.

   The IANA has also registered &quot;SOAP over BEEP&quot; as a TCP port number,
   as specified in Section 8.4.

   The IANA now broadens these three registries to support the family of
   BEEP profiles defined by this URI prefix.

   Finally, the IANA maintains a list of SOAP profile features, cf.
   Section 7.1.  The IESG is responsible for assigning a designated
   expert to review the specification prior to the IANA making the
   assignment.  Prior to contacting the IESG, developers of SOAP profile
   features must use the mailing list beepwg@lists.beepcore.org to
   solicit commentary.

11.  Changes from RFC 3288

   This memo differs from RFC 3288 [16] in one substantive way: a URL
   prefix is defined to support a family of BEEP profiles corresponding
   to different versions of SOAP.  Similarly, the IANA registrations in
   Section 8.1, Section 8.3, and Section 8.4 are updated to reflect this
   broadening.

   Support for W3C MTOM/XOP packaging has been added.

   A new section was added to discuss the distributed state machine of
   the Request-Response MEP.

   In non-substantive ways, a small number of typographical errors were
   corrected.

Appendix A.  SOAP with Attachments (Informative)

   To provide compatibility with RFC3288 [16], a BEEP profile for SOAP
   MAY allow envelopes to be transmitted as the root part of a
   &quot;multipart/related&quot; [18] content, and with subordinate parts
   referenced using the rules of Section 3 of [19] (i.e., using either
   the &quot;Content-ID:&quot; [20] or &quot;Content-Location:&quot; [21] headers), e.g.,

    MSG 1 2 . 278 657
    Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=&quot;MIME_boundary&quot;;
                  type=application/xml;
                  start=&quot;&lt;claim061400a.xml@claiming-it.com&gt;&quot;

    --MIME_boundary
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-ID: &lt;claim061400a.xml@claiming-it.com&gt;

    &lt;?xml version=&#x27;1.0&#x27; ?&gt;
    &lt;env:Envelope
         xmlns:env=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot;&gt;
     ..
    &lt;/env:Header&gt;
    &lt;env:Body&gt;
    &lt;theSignedForm href=&quot;cid:claim061400a.tiff@claiming-it.com&quot; /&gt;
     ..
    &lt;/env:Body&gt;
    &lt;/env:Envelope&gt;

    --MIME_boundary
    Content-Type: image/tiff
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
    Content-ID: &lt;claim061400a.tiff@claiming-it.com&gt;

     ...binary TIFF image...
    --MIME_boundary--
    END

   Consistent with Section 2 of [19], it is strongly recommended that
   the multipart contain a &quot;start&quot; parameter, and that the root part
   contain a &quot;Content-ID:&quot; header.  However, because BEEP provides an
   8bit-wide path, a &quot;transformative&quot; Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g.,
   &quot;base64&quot; or &quot;quoted-printable&quot;) should not be used.  Further note
   that MIME [9] requires that the value of the &quot;Content-ID&quot; header be
   globally unique.
