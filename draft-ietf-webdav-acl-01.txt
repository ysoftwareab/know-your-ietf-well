    1  INTRODUCTION 

         The underlying principle of access control is that who you are 
         determines how you can access a resource. The "who you are" is 
         defined by a "principal" identifier; users, client software, 
         servers, and groups of the previous have principal identifiers. 
         The "how" is determined by an "access control list" (ACL) 
         associated with a resource.  An ACL contains a set of "access 
         control entries" (ACEs), where each ACE specifies a principal and 
         a set of rights that are either granted or denied to that 
         principal. 


    1.1 Notational Conventions 

         The augmented BNF used by this document to describe protocol 
         elements is described in Section 2.1 of [RFC2068]. Because this 
         augmented BNF uses the basic production rules provided in Section 
         2.2 of [RFC2068], those rules apply to this document as well. 

         The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
         NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
         "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
         [RFC2119]. 


    2  PRINCIPALS 

         A principal identifies an entity that can be given access rights 
         to HTTP resources.  On many implementations, a user or a group 
         will be examples of principals, but other types of principals are 
         possible.  For the most part, any classification or other 
         information about the entity identified by a principal is opaque 
         with respect to this specification, and is dependent on the 
         implementation.   

         Principals are manifested to clients as a HTTP resource, 
         identified by a URL.  The set of properties exposed by that 
         resource are implementation dependent, although certain 
         properties are required by this specification.  Those properties 
         include: 

           @ <dav:principalname>:     A "live" property containing the 
                             name used to authenticate this principal 
                             (typically typed into a login prompt/dialog).  
                             [OPTIONAL] 

           @ <dav:displayname>:  A property containing a human-readable 
                             description of this principal.  This property 
                             may be "live" and not settable via PROPPATCH. 
                             [REQUIRED] 

           @ <dav:principal-type>:    A "live" property containing a 
                             classification word for this principal.  The 
                             values <dav:user/> and <dav:group/> are 
                             choices for value of this property 
                             recommended by this spec. The presence of

    INTERNET-DRAFT           WebDAV ACL              May 1, 2000 



                             this property can be used to distinguish it 
                             as a principal from other resources on a 
                             WebDAV server.  (Note that <dav:resourcetype> 
                             may not be used, as all collections must use 
                             the value "collection" for <resourcetype>, 
                             which wouldn't distinguish normal collections 
                             from principal collections.) [REQUIRED] 

         Server implementations may include any other descriptive 
         information for a principal via properties. 

         A principal resource may or may not be a collection.  A 
         collection principal may only contain other principals (not other 
         types of resources).  Servers that support aggregation of 
         principals (e.g. groups of users or other groups) MUST manifest 
         them as collection principals.  The WebDAV methods for examining 
         maintaining collections (e.g. BIND, DELETE, PROPFIND) may be used 
         to maintain collection principals.  Membership in a collection 
         principal is recusive, so a principal in a collection principal A 
         contained by collection principal B is a member of both 
         collection principals.  Implementations not supporting recursive 
         membership in principal collections can return an error if the 
         client attempts to bind collection principals into other 
         collection principals.  Using WebDAV methods to alter the content 
         of a principal (e.g. using PROPPATCH or PUT) is outside the scope 
         of this specification, and is not required, recommended, or 
         forbidden by this spec. 


    3  RIGHTS 

         A right controls access to a particular set of HTTP operations on 
         a resource.  The set of rights that apply to a particular 
         resource may vary with the <dav:resourcetype> of the resource, as 
         well as between different server implementations.  To promote 
         interoperability, however, WebDAV defines a set of well-known 
         rights (e.g. <dav:read> and <dav:write>), which can at least be 
         used to set some context to the other rights defined on a 
         particular resource. 

         Rights may be aggregates of other rights.  For example, one 
         implementation may split out a right controlling the ability to 
         BIND children into a collection from the right allowing a 
         resource to be removed from a collection.  Since these rights 
         control the ability to write to a collection, these rights would 
         be aggregated by the <dav:write> right.  The relationships 
         between atomic rights and aggregate rights can be discovered via 
         the RIGHTS-DISCOVERY HTTP method on a particular resource.  
         Servers may specify some rights as abstract, which means that it 
         may not appear in an ACL, but is described in the RIGHTS-
         DISCOVERY method to aid in setting context.  Server 
         implementations must return the same response to the RIGHTS-
         DISCOVERY method on all of the resources with the same 
         <dav:resourcetype> value.

    3.1 RIGHTS-DISCOVERY method 

         Rights discovery is a method with no arguments, that returns the 
         rights aggregation tree.  Each right appears as an XML element, 
         where aggregate rights list all of their children as sub-
         elements.  Each right element can contain the following 
         attributes: 

           @ abstract (Boolean):  "true" if this right cannot be used in 
              an ACL/ACE.  Defaults to "false" 

           @ description (string):  a human readable description of what 
              this right controls access to.  Required. 

         For example, the following response might be generated to a 
         RIGHTS-DISCOVERY request on a WebDAV server implemented by a 
         relational database (where the resource in this case corresponds 
         to a table): 

         Request 
         RIGHTS-DISCOVERY /schemas/scott/emp HTTP/1.1 
         Host: www.foo.bar 
         Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"  
         Content-Length: 0 
     
         Response 
         HTTP/1.1 200 Success 
         Content-Type: text/xml 
         Content-Length: xxxxx 
          
         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 
         <?namespace href = "http://www.oracle.com/webdav/ AS = ORA"?> 
         <D:response> 
           <D:all abstract=true description="All access"> 
             <D:write abstract=true description="Write any database row"> 
               <ORA:insert abstract=false description="Insert a row"/> 
               <ORA:update abstract=false description="Update a row"/> 
               <ORA:delete abstract=false description="Delete a row"/> 
             </D:write> 
             <D:read abstract=false description="SELECT data from a row"/> 
             <D:readacl abstract=false description="Read the ACL"/> 
             <D:acadmin abstract=false description="Update the ACL and 
         owner"/> 
           </D:all> 
         </D:response> 
          

            It is envisioned that a WebDAV ACL-aware administrative client 
         would list the available in a dialog box, and allow the user to 
         choose non-abstract rights to apply in an ACE.  The rights tree 
         is useful programmatically to map well-known rights (defined by 
         WebDAV or other standards groups) into rights that are supported 
         by any particular server implementation.

    3.2 Rights defined by WebDAV 

         The rights defined by WebDAV access control MUST be present in 
         the response to the RIGHTS-DISCOVERY method, although they may be 
         abstract (and not usable within an ACE on a particular 
         implementation).   


    3.2.1read Right 

         Name:            <dav:read> 

         Purpose:         The read right provides and restricts access to 
         information regarding the state of the resource, including the 
         resource's properties. Affected methods include GET and PROPFIND.  
         The read right does not affect the OPTIONS method since it 
         reflects capabilities rather than state. 


    3.2.2write Right 

         Name:            <dav:write> 

         Purpose:         The <write> right affects the same methods as 
         the Write Lock. Please refer to [WEBDAV] section 5.3 for the list 
         of affected methods. Note however, that a write lock is a 
         different mechanism than a write access change, although they 
         affect the same methods, they have independent methods to set 
         them and independent error codes. 


    3.2.3readacl Right 

         Name:            <dav:readacl> 

         Purpose:         The <readacl> right provides and restricts 
         access to the <dav:acl> property of this resource, rather than 
         the <dav:read> right.  If a user has the <readacl> right and not 
         the <read> right, the <dav:acl> property ONLY is accessible via 
         PROPFIND, and the GET method is not authorized.  If a user has 
         the <read> right and not the <readacl> right, the <dav:acl> 
         property will not be included in any PROPFIND requests on the 
         associated resource. 


    3.2.4writeacl Right 

         Name:            <dav:writeacl> 

         Purpose:         The <writeacl> (Access Control ADMINistration) 
         right provides and restricts access to ACL method, which is the 
         only means of altering the <dav:acl> (and indirectly, 
         <dav:rights>) property of a resource. 


    3.2.5all Right 

         Name:            <dav:all> 



    Sedlar, Clemm                                       [Page 6] 



    INTERNET-DRAFT           WebDAV ACL              May 1, 2000 



         Purpose:         The <dav:all> right controls all other rights on 
         this resource.  If the <dav:all> right appears in an ACE, it is 
         an error to have any other right in that ACE.  This right is 
         merely shorthand for all of the rights enumerated in the RIGHTS-
         DISCOVERY method, and should not control access to rights not 
         exposed via that route. 

          


    4  ACCESS CONTROL PROPERTIES 

         This specification defines a number of new properties for WebDAV 
         resources.  Access control properties may be retrieved just like 
         other WebDAV properties, using the PROPFIND method.  An HTTP 
         resource on a WebDAV ACL-compliant server MUST contain the 
         following properties: 

           @ <dav:owner>:   A property containing the principal 
                             information identifying a particular user as 
                             the owner of the resource.  This property is 
                             readable by anyone with read access to the 
                             resource.  There is no provision for a client 
                             updating this property in this spec, however 
                             it is recommended that any authenticated user 
                             with appropriate administrative privileges be 
                             allowed to issue a PROPPATCH to update its 
                             value. Normally, an attempt to PROPPATCH this 
                             property will result in a 401 (Not 
                             Authorized) error.  [REQUIRED] 

           @ <dav:owner-name>:   A "live" property containing a human-
                             readable description of the <dav:owner>   
                             [OPTIONAL] 

           @ <dav:rights>:  A "live" property containing the list of 
                             rights of the currently authenticated HTTP 
                             user.  Read access to this property is 
                             controlled by the <read> right.  This 
                             property can NEVER be set directly.  
                             [REQUIRED] 

           @ <dav:acl>:     A "live" property containing one or more 
                             <dav:ace> tags, which specify which 
                             principals are to get access to what rights, 
                             for the resource with this ACL property.  
                             [REQUIRED] 

         The <dav:acl> element (property) contains 0 or more of the 
         following XML elements: 

           @ <dav:ace>:     An access control entry, which specifies the 
                             set of rights to be granted to a single 
                             principal. 

         The <dav:ace> element contains the following XML elements: 





    Sedlar, Clemm                                       [Page 7] 



    INTERNET-DRAFT           WebDAV ACL              May 1, 2000 



           @ <dav:grant>:   Contains the set of XML elements 
                             corresponding to the rights being granted via 
                             this ACE.  Must contain at least one right   

           @ <dav:deny>:    Contains the set of XML elements 
                             corresponding to the rights being denied via 
                             this ACE.  Must contain at least one right, 
                             if present. 

           @ <dav:principal-id>: A URL of the principal resource this ACE 
                             applies to, or one of the tags <dav:owner> or 
                             <dav:all-principals>.  Always present.  The 
                             value of this element must be unique within 
                             an ACL. 

           @ <dav:principal>:    Contains properties of the principal 
                             resource (made available here to avoid the 
                             need for a separate PROPFIND request).  
                             Optional. 

         A PROPFIND on a resource on a WebDAV ACL server might produce the 
         following XML output:

    5  USING ACLS 

         By default, a principal has no access rights to an object 
         protected by an ACL. A particular ACE may either grant or deny a 
         set of rights to a single principal.  It is illegal for an ACL to 
         have two ACEs applying to the same principal.  However, since a 
         server may match the currently authenticated HTTP user with 
         multiple principals, it is possible for multiple ACEs to apply to 
         the current user.  In this case, if a particular right is denied 
         to the current user by any ACE, this supercedes any ACE that 
         might grant that right.  This is the case regardless if a ("more 
         specific") ACE granting access applied to a principal identifying 
         the user directly, while the ACE denying access applied to a 
         collection principal containing that user.  The particular order 
         of the ACEs within an ACL is irrelevant.  The <principal-id> tag 
         can also contain the following special tags: <owner>, <all>, 
         <unauthenticated>.  These tags have the following meaning: 


    Sedlar, Clemm                                       [Page 9] 



    INTERNET-DRAFT           WebDAV ACL              May 1, 2000 



           @ owner:  The principal identified by the owner property on 
              this resource is granted or denied the rights specified in 
              this ACE. 

           @ all:  The current user always matches this ACE, whether or 
              not s/he is authenticated. 

           @ unauthenticated:  The current user matches this ACE if not 
              authenticated 

         Server implementations may limit the number of ACEs in an ACL.  
         However, ACL-compliant servers are required to support at least 
         one ACE granting rights to a single principal, and one ACE 
         granting rights to a collection principal.  The server should 
         return an error "Too many ACEs" in this case. 


    6  ACL METHOD 

         The ACL Method provides a mechanism to set ACL information. Its 
         request body is used to define alterations to the ACL of the 
         resource identified by the request-URI. Its response body 
         contains the current ACL for that resource.  The ACL method 
         replaces the <acl> and <owner> properties on the specified 
         resource with the properties in the request.  All readable ACEs 
         previously stored in the ACL on the indicated resource are 
         removed, so an ACL method on a resource with an unreadable <acl> 
         property will be ignored.  (If the server implements rights 
         outside of those defined in this specification, they might allow 
         only some ACEs to be visibleùin this case, only part of the ACL 
         will be replaced). 

         Change requests through the ACL method MUST be atomic. If any 
         part of the change request fails then all changes MUST fail.  The 
         presence of an empty ACL causes all ACEs in the ACL, including 
         ACEs for associated properties, to be deleted.  An empty request 
         body will cause no change to the ACL or associated values.  If 
         the <principal> element (specifying properties of the resource 
         identified by the ACE's <principal-id>) is specified, it (and its 
         children) is ignored. 

          


    6.1 Example 1 - Setting ACLs 

         An ACL request body is an acl-info XML element.  The <dav:acl-
         info> element contains properties that can be set by the ACL 
         method (currently just <acl>).  

         Request 
         ACL /top/container HTTP/1.1 
         Host: www.foo.com 
         Content-Type: text/xml 
         Content-Length: xxxx 
         <?namespace href = "http://www.ietf.org/standards/webdav/ AS = 
         D"?> 
         <D:acl-info>

         This request changes the group ACE to disallow read access to the 
         ACL for the marketing group. The other information had to be 
         recopied from the ACL retrieved in the previous example.

    19 STILL TO DO : 

           @ Describe the interactions with resource locking.  I'm not 
              clear what the resolution was as far as locking the ACL 
              separately from locking the resource.
