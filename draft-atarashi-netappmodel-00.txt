Abstract

   This document describes the model for application and network
   interaction in reaction to Application Area Architecture Workshop
   held on February 11 and 12, 2008.  There is not completed mechanism
   for collaboration between application and network yet even though a
   solution is required.  The model proposed in this document is
   designed without a layer violation.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the model for application and network
   interaction in reaction to Application Area Architecture Workshop
   held on February 11 and 12, 2008.  There is not completed mechanism
   for collaboration between application and network yet even though a
   solution is required.  The model proposed in this document is
   designed without a layer violation.

1.1.  Motivation

   From the application point of view, application users want to use
   network resources (ex. bandwidth, response time) and new network
   functions (ex.  QoS, VLAN) flexibly.  Applications and services have
   requirements for network behavior depending on the functions provided
   by the application.  For example, a streaming service requires high
   bandwidth and low delay network, database transactions need no
   packet-loss network but don't need high bandwidth.
   From the network point of view, it is useful for operation to know
   the application behavior.  If they can know the requirement from
   application, it may be possible to prepare the responded environment.
   It was impossible to change the configurations on demand, but NETCONF
   can be change the configuration flexibly.
   Now, it is ready to design the application common architecture,
   because the components are all together.

1.2.  Problems

   One of the reasons that the collaboration is difficult is that we
   don't share a common architecture and terminology.  There is a gap
   between application requirements and network functions.  Application
   requirements and behavior are defined by service level, but network
   functions are implemented by routing and low level configurations.
   When we have a requirement for network behavior, we have to configure
   routers using CLI (Command Line Interface).  It is hard because we
   have to master router configuration.  And it is impossible that
   configuration changes automatically and frequently.
   We need an interface to collaborate between the applications and the
   network.  IMO, the interface is defined not API-like function, but
   also model-like description.  For example,

      - Application service model

      - Network function model

   These kinds of models may be higher level concept than API.  As a
   application user for the NETCONF, the guideline is need to use and
   combine the application technologies and protocols.

1.3.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Adding Building Block

   At the Application Area Architecture Workshop, we agreed to add the
   application *semantic* layer which is really what users are
   interested in, and this is different even from the application
   *protocol* layer.  For example, "jabber" is in the Semantic Layer,
   "xmpp" is in the Protocol Layer.

        Layer              examples

   +-----------------+    +----------+
   | Semantic Layer  |    | jabber   |
   +-----------------+    +----------+
   | Protocol Layer  |    |  xmpp    |
   +-----------------+    +----------+
   | Transport Layer |    | TCP/SCTP |
   +-----------------+    +----------+
   | Internet Layer  |    | IP/IPv6  |
   +-----------------+    +----------+
   | Datalink Layer  |    | VLAN     |
   +-----------------+    +----------+
   | Physical Layer  |    | Ethernet |
   +-----------------+    +----------+

3.  Network and Application Interaction

   In order to implement to interact with application and network
   *management function* is needed outside the layer.  Each layer is
   managed by the management function.  The requirements from the
   Semantic Layer are conveyed to the management function to implement
   in the other layer.  For example, a "closed network" is requested
   from the application, an VLAN is implemented in the Datalink Layer.

   +-----------------+    +------------+
   | Semantic Layer  |<-->|            |
   +-----------------+    |            |
   | Protocol Layer  |<-->|            |
   +-----------------+    |            |
   | Transport Layer |<-->|            |
   +-----------------+    | management |
   | Internet Layer  |<-->|            |
   +-----------------+    |            |
   | Datalink Layer  |<-->|            |
   +-----------------+    |            |
   | Physical Layer  |<-->|            |
   +-----------------+    +------------+
