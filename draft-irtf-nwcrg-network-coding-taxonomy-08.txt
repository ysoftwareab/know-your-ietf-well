   Taxonomy of Coding Techniques for Efficient Network Communications
              draft-irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy-08

Abstract

   This document is the product of the Network Coding Research Group
   (NWCRG).  It summarizes a recommended terminology for Network Coding
   concepts and constructs.  It provides a comprehensive set of terms in
   order to avoid ambiguities in future IRTF and IETF documents on
   Network Coding.  This document is in-line with the terminology used
   by the RFCs produced by the Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) and
   FEC Framework (FECFRAME) IETF working groups.

1.  Introduction

   This document is not an IETF product and is not a standard.  This
   document is the product and represents the consensus of the Network
   Coding Research Group (NWCRG).  In 2017, it has been discussed during
   three audio conferences, each of them gathering 6 to 8 key experts,
   it has been co-edited, and finally subject to a RG Last Call.  The
   general feeling was that the document was ready for the next step.

   The literature on Network Coding research and system design, IETF
   included, led to a rich set of concepts and constructs.  This
   document collects terminology used in the domain, both outside and
   inside IETF, provides concise definitions, and introduces a high-
   level taxonomy.  Its primary goal is to be useful to IETF and IRTF
   activities.  It is also in-line with the terminology already used by
   the RFCs produced by the Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) and FEC
   Framework (FECFRAME) IETF working groups, in particular [RFC5052]
   [RFC5740] [RFC5775] [RFC6363] [RFC6726].  Note that in the
   definitions, the "(IETF)" tag indicates that the associated term is
   already used in IETF documents.

   This document focuses on packet transmissions and packet losses.
   These losses will typically be triggered by various types of
   networking issues and/or impairments (e.g., congested routers or
   intermittent wireless connectivity).  The notion of "packet" itself
   is multiform, depending on the target use-case and the notion of
   network (e.g., in which layer of the protocol stack does the coding
   middleware operate?).  For instance, a "packet" may be a data unit to
   be carried as a UDP payload because the coding middleware is located
   between the application and UDP.  In another configuration, coding
   may be applied within an overlay network and the notion of "packet"
   will be totally different.  In any case the goals of Network Coding
   can be to improve the network throughput, efficiency, latency, and
   scalability, as well as providing resilience to partition, attacks,
   and eavesdropping (NWCRG charter).  Both End-to-End Coding and
   systems that also perform re-coding within intermediate forwarding
   nodes are considered in this document.

   This document does not consider physical layer transmission issues,
   nor physical layer codes, nor error detection: if low layer error
   codes detect but fail to correct bit errors, or if an upper layer
   checksum (e.g., within IP or UDP) identifies a corrupted packet, then
   this packet is supposed to be dropped.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  General definitions and concepts

   This section gathers general definitions and concepts that are used
   throughout this document.

   Packet Erasure Channel:  A communication path where packets are
           either dropped or received without any error.  This type of
           packet drop is referred to as an "erasure" or "loss".  The
           term "channel" must be understood as a generic term for any
           type of communication technology (e.g., an Ethernet link, a
           WiFi network, or a full path between two nodes over the
           Internet).  The "Erasure" channels are opposed to "Error"
           channels where one or multiple bit errors may happen during a
           packet transmission.  These "Error" channels are out of
           scope.

   Erasure Correcting Code (ECC), or (IETF) Forward Erasure Code (FEC):

                A code for the Packet Erasure Channel (only).  These
                codes are also called "Application-Level FEC" to
                highlight that they have been designed to be used within
                the higher layers of the protocol stack, to protect
                against packet losses.  These codes are opposed to
                "Error" correction codes that are capable of identifying
                the presence and/or correcting bit errors.  The "Error"
                correction codes are out of scope.

        End-to-End Coding:  A system where coding is performed at the
                source or (coding) middlebox, and decoding at the
                destination(s) or (decoding) middlebox.  There is no re-
                coding operation at intermediate nodes.  This is the
                approach followed in the FLUTE/ALC [RFC6726][RFC5775],
                NORM [RFC5740] and FECFRAME [RFC6363] protocols.

        Network Coding:  A system where coding can be performed at the
                source as well as at intermediate forwarding nodes (all
                or a subset of them).  End-to-End Coding is regarded as
                a special case of Network Coding.  Depending on the use
                case, additional assumptions can be made: for instance
                the knowledge by the destination of the coding nodes
                topology and coding operations can help during decoding
                operations.

Internet-Draft        Taxonomy of Coding Techniques           March 2018


        Packet versus Symbol:  Generally speaking, a Packet is the unit
                of data that is sent in the Packet Erasure Channel,
                while a Symbol is the unit of data that is manipulated
                during the encoding and decoding operations.

        Original Payload, or Uncoded Payload, or Systematic Symbol, or
        (IETF) Source Symbol:
                A unit of data originating from the source that is used
                as input to encoding operations.  When there is a single
                Source Symbol per Source Packet, an Original Payload
                corresponds to a Source Packet.

        Coded Payload, Coded Symbol, or (IETF) Repair Symbol:  A unit of
                data that is the result of a coding operation, applied
                either to Source Symbols or (in case of recoding) Source
                and/or Repair Symbols.  When there is a single Repair
                Symbol per Repair Packet, a Coded Payload corresponds to
                a Repair Packet.

        Input Symbol and Output Symbol:  A unit of data that is used as
                input to an encoding operation or that is generated as
                output of an encoding operation.  At a re-coding node,
                Repair Symbols are also part of the Input Symbols.  With
                Systematic Coding, Source Symbols are also part of the
                Output Symbols.

        (IETF) Encoding Symbol:  A Source or a Repair Symbol.

        (En)coding versus Recoding versus Decoding:  (En)coding is an
                operation that takes Source Symbols as input and
                produces Encoding Symbols as output.  Recoding is an
                operation that takes Encoding Symbols as input and
                produces Encoding Symbols as output.  Decoding is an
                operation takes Encoding Symbols as input and produces
                Source Symbols as output.

        (IETF) Source Packet:  A packet originating from the source
                which contributes to one or more Source Symbols.  For
                instance, an RTP packet as a whole can constitute a
                Source Symbol.  In other situations (e.g, to address
                variable size packets) a single RTP packet may
                contribute to various Source Symbols.

        (IETF) Repair Packet:  A packet containing one or more Repair
                Symbols.

   Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between packets (what is sent
   in the Packet Erasure Channel) and symbols (what is manipulated

   during encoding and decoding operations) in case of FEC encoding, at
   a Coding Node that performs Encoding (rather than Recoding).  FEC
   decoding procedures are similarly performed in the reverse order.

                 performs Encoding (rather than Recoding).

   Source Node:  A node that generates one or more Source Flows.

   Coding Node:  A node that performs FEC Encoding or Recoding
           operations.  It may be an end-host or a middlebox (Encoding
           case), or a forwarding node (Recoding case).

   (IETF) Flow:  A stream of packets logically grouped.

   (IETF) Source Flow:  A flow of Source Packets coming from an
           application on a given host, and to which FEC encoding is to
           be applied, potentially along with other Source Flows.
           Depending on the use case, Source Flows may come from the
           same application, from different applications on the same
           host, or from different applications on different hosts.

   (IETF) Repair flow:  A flow containing Repair Packets, after FEC
           encoding.

3.  Taxonomy of Code Uses

   This section discusses the various ways of using coding, without
   going into coding details.

   Source Coding versus Channel Coding:  (see Figure 2) When both terms
           are opposed, "Source Coding" usually refers to compression
           techniques (e.g., audio and video compression) within the
           upper application that generates the source flow.  On the
           opposite, "Channel Coding" refers to FEC encoding in order to
           improve transmission robustness, for instance within the
           lower physical layer (out of scope of this document) or as
           part of Network Coding.  These terms should not be confused
           with respectively "FEC coding within the Source Node" and
           "FEC re-coding within an intermediate Coding Node".

   Figure 2: Example of end-to-end flow manipulation with Network Coding
      between the application and UDP layers (as with RMT or FECFRAME
   architectures).  Other architectures are possible, for instance with
   network coding below the transport layer in order to allow re-coding
                            within the network.

   Intra-Flow Coding, or Single Source Network Coding:  Process where
           incoming packets to the Coding Node belong to the same flow.

   Inter-Flow Coding, or Multi-Source Network Coding:  Process where
           incoming packets to the Coding Node belong to different
           flows.

   Single-Path Coding:  Network Coding over a route that has a single
           path from the source to each destination(s).  In case of
           multicast or broadcast traffic, this route is a tree.  Coding
           may be done end-to-end and/or at intermediate forwarding
           nodes.

   Multi-Path Coding:  Network Coding over a route that has multiple (at
           least partially) disjoint paths from the source to each given
           destination.  Coding may be done end-to-end and/or at
           intermediate forwarding nodes.

4.  Coding Details

4.1.  Coding Types

   This section provides a high-level taxonomy of coding techniques.
   Technical details are left for the following sections.

   Linear Coding:  Linear combination of a set of input symbols (i.e.,
           Source and/or Repair Symbols) using a given set of
           coefficients and resulting in a Repair Symbol.  Many linear
           codes exist that differ from the way coding coefficients are
           drawn from a Finite Field of a given size.

   Random Linear Coding (RLC):  Particular case of Linear Coding using a
           set of random coding coefficients.

   Adaptive Linear Coding:  Linear Coding that utilizes cross layer
           adaptation.  For instance, an adaptive coding scheme may
           adapt the generation and transmission of Repair Packets
           according to the channel variations over time, accounting for
           the predictive loss of degrees of freedom due to erasures.

   Block Coding:  Coding technique where the input Flow(s) must be first
           segmented into a sequence of blocks, FEC encoding and
           decoding being performed independently on a per-block basis.
           The term "Chunk Coding" is sometimes used, where a "Chunk"
           denotes a block.

   Sliding Window Coding, or Convolutional Coding:  General class of
           coding techniques that rely on a sliding encoding window.
           This is an alternative solution to Block Coding.

   Fixed or Elastic Sliding Window Coding:  Coding technique that
           generates Repair Symbol(s) on-the-fly, from the set of Source
           Symbols present in the sliding encoding window at that time,
           usually by using Linear Coding.  The sliding window may be
           either of fixed size or of variable size over the time (also
           known as "elastic sliding window").  For instance, this size
           may depend on acknowledgments sent by the receiver(s) for a
           particular Source Symbol or Source Packet (received, decoded,
           or decodable).

Internet-Draft        Taxonomy of Coding Techniques           March 2018


   Systematic Coding:  A coding technique where Source Symbols are part
           of the output Flow generated by a Coding Node.

   Rateless and Non-Rateless Coding:  Rateless Coding can generate an
           unlimited number of Repair Symbols (in practice this number
           can be limited by practical considerations or because of use-
           case requirements) from a given set of Source Symbols,
           meaning that the code rate is null.  RLC codes are an example
           of Rateless Codes.  On the opposite, Non-Rateless Coding
           usually has a predefined maximum number of Repair Symbols
           that can be generated from a given set of Source Symbols.

4.2.  Coding Basics

   This section discusses and defines low level coding aspects.

   Code Rate:  In case of a Block Code, the Code Rate is the k/n ratio
           between the number of Source Symbols, k, and the number of
           Source plus Repair Symbols, n.  With a Sliding Window Code,
           the Code Rate is defined similarly over a certain time
           interval, since the Code Rate may change dynamically.  By
           definition, the Code Rate is such that: 0 < Code Rate <= 1.
           A Code Rate close to 1 indicates that a small number of
           Repair Symbols have been produced during the encoding process
           and vice-versa.

   (En)coding Window:  A set of Source (and Repair in the case of re-
           coding) Symbols used as input to the coding operations.  The
           set of symbols will typically change over the time, as the
           Coding Window slides over the input Flow(s).

   (En)coding Window Size:  The number of Source (and Repair in case of
           re-coding) Symbols in the current Encoding Window.  This size
           may change over the time.

   Payload Set:  The set of Source and Repair Symbols available (i.e.,
           received or previously decoded) at the receiver and used
           during FEC decoding operations.

   Decoding window:  The set of Source Symbols (only) that are
           considered in the current linear system of a receiver,
           independently of the fact these Source Symbols have been
           received, decoded, or lost.  The Decoding Window will
           typically change over the time, as transmissions and decoding
           progress, and may be different for different receivers of a
           session where content is multicast or broadcast.

Internet-Draft        Taxonomy of Coding Techniques           March 2018


   Decoding Window Size:  The number of Source Symbols (only) in the
           current Decoding Window.  This size may change over the time.

   Rank of a Payload Set, or (IETF) Rank of the Linear System:  At a rec
           eiver, number of linearly independent members of a Payload
           Set, or equivalently the number of linearly independent
           equations of the linear system.  It is also known as "Degrees
           of Freedom".  The system may be of "full rank" and decoding
           is possible, or "partial rank", and only partial decoding is
           possible.

   Seen Payload, or Seen Symbol:  A Source Symbol is Seen when the
           receiver can compute a linear combination with this symbol
           and Source Symbols that are strictly more recent (i.e., with
           logically higher Encoding Symbol Identifiers).  Otherwise the
           Source Symbol is considered as "unseen".

   Generation, or (IETF) Block:  With Block Codes, the set of Source
           Symbols of the input Flow(s) that are logically grouped into
           a Block, before doing encoding.

   Generation Size, or Code Dimension, or (IETF) Block Size:  With Block
           Codes, the number k of Source Symbols belonging to a Block.

   Coding Matrix, or Generator Matrix:  A matrix G that transforms the
           set of Input Symbols X into a set of Repair Symbols: Y = X *
           G.  Defining a Generator Matrix is usual with Block Codes.
           The set of Input Symbols X can consist only of Source Symbols
           (e.g., with End-to-End Coding) or can consist of Source and
           Repair Symbols (e.g., with re-coding in an intermediate
           node).

   Coding Coefficient:  With Linear Coding, this is a coefficient in a
           certain Finite Field.  This coefficient may be chosen in
           different ways: randomly, or in a pre-defined table, or using
           a pre-defined algorithm plus a seed.

   Coding Vector:  A set of Coding Coefficients used to generate a
           certain Repair Symbol through Linear Coding.  The number of
           nonzero coefficients in the Coding Vector defines its
           density.

   Finite Field, or Galois Field, or Coding Field:  Finite fields, used
           in Linear Codes, have the desired property of having all
           elements (except zero) invertible for + and * and all
           operations over any elements do not result in an overflow or
           underflow.  Examples of Finite Fields are prime fields
           {0..p^m-1}, where p is prime.  Most used fields use p=2 and

Internet-Draft        Taxonomy of Coding Techniques           March 2018


           are called binary extension fields {0..2^m-1}, where m often
           equals 1, 4 or 8 for practical reasons.

   Finite Field size, or Coding Field size:  The number of elements in a
           finite field.  For example the binary extension field
           {0..2^m-1} has size q=2^m.

   Feedback:  Feedback information sent by a decoding node to a Coding
           Node (or from a receiver to a source in case of End-to-End
           Coding).  The nature of information contained in a feedback
           packet varies, depending on the use-case.  It can provide
           reception and/or FEC decoding statistics, or the list of
           available Source Packets received or decoded
           (acknowledgement), or the list of lost Source Packets that
           should be retransmitted (negative acknowledgement), or a
           number of additional Repair Symbols needed to have a Full
           Rank Linear System.

4.3.  Coding In Practice

   This section discusses practical aspects.  Indeed, a practical
   solution must specify the exact manner encoding and decoding is
   performed but also all the peripheral aspects, for instance how an
   encoder informs a decoder about the parameters used to generate a
   certain Repair Packet (signaling).

   (IETF) FEC Scheme:  A specification that defines the additional
           protocol aspects required to use a particular FEC code.  In
           particular the FEC Scheme defines in band (e.g., information
           contained in Source and Repair Packet header or trailers) and
           out of band (e.g., information contained in an SDP
           description) signaling needed to synchronize encoders and
           decoders.

   Payload Indices, or (IETF) Encoding Symbol Identifiers (ESI):  An ide
           ntifier of a Source or Repair Symbol.  If conceptually, each
           symbol is identified by a unique ESI value, in practice, with
           a continuous flow and a limited field size to hold the ESI,
           wrapping to zero in unavoidable and the same integer value
           will be re-used several times.

   (IETF) FEC Payload ID:  Information that identifies the contents of a
           packet with respect to the FEC Scheme.  The FEC Payload ID of
           a packet containing Source Symbol(s) is usually different
           from that of a packet containing Repair Symbol(s).  The FEC
           Payload ID typically contains at least an ESI.

Internet-Draft        Taxonomy of Coding Techniques           March 2018


   Coding Vector and Encoding Window Signaling:  With Sliding Window
           Codes, the FEC Payload ID of a Repair Packet contains
           information needed and sufficient to identify the Coding
           Vector and Coding Window.  Concerning the Coding Vector, this
           may consist of a full list of Coding Coefficients (that may
           be compressed or not), or a piece of information (e.g., a
           seed) that can be used to generate the list of Coding
           Coefficients thanks to a predefined algorithm known by
           encoders and decoders (e.g., a Pseudo Random Number
           Generator, or PRNG), or an ESI that points to a given entry
           in a Generator Matrix in case of a Block Code.  Concerning
           the Coding Window, this may consist of the full list of ESI
           of symbols in the Coding Window (that may be compressed or
           not), or the ESI of the first Source Symbol along with their
           number (assuming there is no gap).
