     This is a concrete service type. The fcip:entity service type is
     used to register individual FCIP Entity addresses to be discovered
     by others. UAs will generally search for these by including one of
     the following:
     - the FCIP Entity Name for which an address is needed
     - the FCIP Discovery Domain Name for which addresses are requested
     - the service URL
