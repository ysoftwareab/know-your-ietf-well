Internet-Draft             BGP-4 Community MIB             November 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing the Border Gateway Protocol's Community
   extension.  [RFC1997].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The BGP-4 MIB, Version 2, provides for an extension mechanism by
   which BGP extensions can have MIBs created under the BGP-4 MIB
   subtree.  This MIB documents the objects for managing the BGP-4
   Community extension as documented in [RFC1997].

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Global Scalars

   o  bgpCommunityTotal - The total number of community sets managed by
      this system.

5.2.  Tables

   o  bgpCommunityAfPathAttrTable - This table provides access to a
      human-readable version of the community associated with BGP
      reachability and also an index into the bgpCommunityElementTable
      which can be used for a canonical version of that set of

      communities.

   o  bgpCommunityElementTable - This table provides canonical access to
      a set of community values.

   o  bgpCommunitySetTable - This table provides additional information
      about a set of communities.

5.3.  Textual Conventions

   o  BgpCommunityTC - The representation of a BGP Community.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the BGP-4 MIB, Second Version

   The BGP-4 MIB provides the bgpExtensions point which is used in the
   root OID for this module.

   Additionally, as BGP communities are properties of the Path
   Attributes set sent for reachability, the base BGP-4 MIB provides the
   index for this table, bgpAfPathAttrIndex.

   Note well that bgpAfPathAttrIndex is meant to be distinct for each
   received set of Path Attributes.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580] and the BGP-4 MIB, Version
   2.

                representing a maximum of 255 characters.  This may
                lead to the string being truncated in the presence of a

                bgpCommunityElementTable row entry.  While its value is
                guaranteed to be unique at any time, it is otherwise
                opaque to the management application with respect to its
                value or the contiguity of the bgpCommunityTableIndex row
                intance values across rows of the bgpCommunityTable.

                Additionally, this value, which represents a distinct set
                of communities, is used as an index in the
                bgpCommunitySetTable.

                It is particularly important to note that there may be a
                many-to-one relationship between this object for a given
                set of indices to a particular bgpCommunityTableIndex.

8.  Security Considerations

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  bgpCommunityElementValue, bgpCommunityElementWellKnown - BGP
      Communities may be used to implement routing policy for ISPs and
      that routing policy may reflect business relationships.
      Inadvertent disclosure of this information inadvertently expose
      sensitive information about those business relationships.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   The BGP-4 MIB extension mechanism owes thanks to Wayne Tackabury and
   the OPS Working Group MIB Doctors.  An earlier form of this extension
   mechanism was originally attempted with Mathew Richardson and Shane
   Wright, formerly of NextHop Technologies.
