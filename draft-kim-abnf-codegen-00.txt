Internet-Draft      ABNF Extensions for code generation         May 2009

Abstract

   This document describes an ABNF extension for code generation.
   The extension has two features; extension rule and non-sequence group
   notations. The extension rules are used to direct the parser
   generator with things like data types, variable names, forced value
   for a variable, etc. The non-sequence group feature was proposed as 
   part of RFC 2234 in the past, but dropped due to its ambiguities.
   The  feature is proposed again in this document not as a fundamental 
   building block, but as an add-on. The elements of a non-sequence group
   are unordered, and are allowed multiple appearance.We attempt to
   minimize the ambiguities stemmed from repetition of an element by defining
   specific repetition rules for elements of a non-sequence group and
   non-sequence group themselves.

Internet-Draft      ABNF Extensions for code generation         May 2009


1.   Introduction

   ABNF, Augmented BNF(Backus-Naur Form) has been widely used for
   Internet specifications.   When ABNF was documented into RFC 2234 in
   1997, non-sequence group was dropped due to its ambiguities. 12
   years later, we found non-sequence group still useful for code
   generation from it into an implementation programming language, like
   C. This documents attempts to reduce ambiguities that stem from
   non-sequence group, by specifying specific repetition rules.

2. Non-sequence Group: {Rule1 Rule2}

   Elements enclosed in braces are unordered.
   Its contents may occur in any order.
   Hence:

     {foo bar} baz

   would match (foo bar baz) and (bar foo baz).
  

2.1. Element's Repetition in a non-sequence group
   Repetition in a Set has a special meaning; it is expanded before
   Set rule applied.

   Hence,  when set   =  {3A X}
           it is rolled out to {A A A X} and
           (A A A X)  / (A A X A)  / (A X A A) / (X A A A)

2.2. Sequence, Grouping, and Alternation in a non-sequence group
   An element in a non-sequence group gets "flattened out" before Set
   rule applied.

   When  g1  =  {(3A) X}, it is same as {3A X} that is expanded
         to {A A A X}, and finally,
         it becomes (A A A X)  / (A A X A)  / (A X A A) / (X A A A)

   Likewise, {(A B C) X} equals to {A B C X}

2.3. Repetition of non-sequence group
   A non-sequence group with a repetition is expanded before
   non-sequence group rule applied.
   When g1  =  {A B},
     2g1 = (g1 g1) = {A B} {B A} = ((A B) / (B A))  ((B A) / (A B))
          = (A B B A) / (A B A B) / (B A B A) / (B A A B)

3. Extension Rule ;--XRule

   An Extension Rule is specified using ;--X to give data type and
   variable name to generated parser code. Appendix B lists
   predefined Extension Rules.

   Each Rule has the reference index 0, and indexes on its right hand 
   side start from 1.
   Alternation and repeater do not have an index value.


4. Restrictions on ABNF for code generation

4.1. Limit on value length
    In case of bin-val, dec-val and hex-val, the maximum length of 
    concatenation is 80
4.2. No option for alternation elements
   An element in alternation should not have options.
   so the rule "A = B / C [D] / E" should change to:
        "A = B / X/  E where X = C [D]"

4.3. Rule Termination
   A rule should be terminated by ";" or ";--X" for an extension rule
        The string from ";" to CRLF is regarded as a comment
        The string from ";--X" to CRLF is regarded as an extension rule

4.4. Maximum Repetition
   The maximum value of unlimited repetitions is 9999.
        So *(SP|HT) can occur 0 - 9999 times.

4.5. Character Range
   A character value should be ranged 0 - 255
        ex) 0x01-0xfc : OK
        0x01-0xffcc : Not OK


5.  ABNF Definition of Non-sequence Group

      non-sequence group =  "{" repetition *(1*c-wsp repetition ) "}"
                          ; repetitions in any order


6.  Security Considerations

   Security is believed to be irrelevant to this document.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

Appendix B. Extension Rules
B.1.   XPDU
   XPDU indicates that the rule performs encoding or decoding
   Synopsis:
      ;--XPDU
   Example:
      StartLine = *CRLF ( StatusLine / ReqLine)
                               ;--XPDU

B.2.   XCUT
   XCUT is used to cut unnecessary parts when the struct type name is
   code-generated.
   Synopsis:
      ;--XCUT [<cut id> *(, <cut id>)]
      where <cut id> is an integer
        It does not have any relation with decoding rules.
        If <cut id> is absent, then the rule does not get generated
        in the user header file
   Example:
      ;--XCUT 1, 4

B.3.   XTYPE
   XTYPE is used to specify the data type for the rule.
   If XTYPE is absent, the struct type is used by default.
   Synopsis:
      ;--XTYPE [<type id>=<type name> *[, <type id> = <type name>]]
      where <type id> is a number

      and <typename> is one of structl, struct, uint, ushort, char*,
      char, uchar, enum, octet(num), octet, char(num), objId, bit,
      float, boolean, null or char*esc.

     The following typenames are used only (typeId=0) TYPE:
              structl, struct, octet(num), octet, objid, bit, enum
      whareas the following  is used only (typeId>0) TYPE :
               null

      Each typename is described below.

  structl
     This type name is used to generate linked struct types.
     Example:

         UriPrms = 1*( ";" UriPrms)

            ;--XCUT 2
            ;--XTYPE 0=struct.
       From the above ABNF definition, something like following can be
       generated.
         typedef struct UriPrms_ {
            struct UriPrms_*        next;
            UriPrm                  value;
        } *UriPrms;

  struct
     This type name is used to generate struct types.

  char*, uint, ushort, char, uchar, enum, char(number), float, and
  boolean. Their namesake types in C is type-defined by the rule names.

  bit
     This type name is used to define a string of zero or more bits,
     and identical to ASN.1 BIT STRING.

      Example:
        NotifyCompletionReason = (TimeOutToken
                                    / InterruptByEventToken
                                    / InterruptByNewSignalsDescrToken
                                    / OtherReasonToken)
                ;--XTYPE 0=bit
                ;--XVAR 2=onTimeOut, 3=onInterruptByEvent,
                ;--XVAR 4=onInterruptByNewSignalDescr, 5=otherReason

      From the above ABNF definition, something like following can
      be generated.

                typedef unsigned char NotifyCompletion;
                #define onTimeOut 0x80
                #define onInterruptByEvent 0x40
                #define onInterruptByNewSignalDescr 0x20
                #define otherReason 0x10

   null
     The type name is mapped to a null type and cannot be assigned to
     0'th element.
     Example:
         TransactionReply = ReplyToken EQUAL TransactionID LBRKT
                                   [ ImmAckRequiredToken COMMA]
                                   TransactionResult RBRKT
                      ;--XCUT 1,2,4,7,9
                      ;--XVAR 3=transactionId, 6=immAckRequired, 
                              8=transactionResult
                      ;--XTYPE 6=null

       From the above ABNF definition, something like following can be
       generated.      
                typedef Nulltype char;
                typedef struct TransactionReply {
                    unsigned char bit_mask;
                    # define immAckRequired_present 0x80
                   TransactionId transactionId;
                   Nulltype immAckRequired;
                   TransactionResult transactionResult;
              } TransactionReply;

   octet(num)
      This type name is used to define a string whose length is the
      given num.  It can be generated into C something like:
            

            typedef struct AAA {

                    unsigned short  length;

                    unsigned char value[num];

            } AAA;

   octet
        This type name is used to define an 8-bit string.
        It can be generated into C something like:

           typedef struct AAA {
                  unsigned short  length;
                  unsigned char*    value;

          } AAA;

   char*esc
      This type name is used when a hex-digit value is mapped to an
      ASCII character. For instance, "%61lice" is mapped to "alice"
      using the following example definition.
      Example:
           UserInfo    = 1*(%x21-3F / %x41-FF) "@"
                        ;--XCUT 4
                        ;--XTYPE 0=char*esc

           The above example definition can be generated to:
                 typedef xc8* UserInfo;

B.4.   XVAR
   This extension rule is used to assign variable names and values.
   Synopsis:
        ;-XVAR nameId=nameVal *(, nameId=nameVal)

B.5.  XCHOICE, XCHOICE_S
   This extension rule is used to assign choice names and values.
   XCHOICE for full choice names
   XCHOICE_S for short choice names
   Synopsis:
        ;--XCHOICE nameId=nameVal *(, nameId=nameVal)
        ;--XCHOICE_S 2,3,4

B.6.  XBITMASK, XBITMASK_S
   This extension rule is used to assign bitmask names and values.
   Synopsis:
        ;--XBITMASK nameId=nameVal *(, nameId=nameVal)
        ;--XBITMASK_S 2,3,4
        short bitmask selection method
        full bitmask name : typename_variablename_present
        short bitmask name : vairablename_present

B.7.  XTDEF
   This is used to do a typedef in C.
   It should not be used with the structl type name
   Synopsis:
        ;--XTDEF digit
   Example:
           AddRequest = AddToken EQUAL AmmRequest
                     ;--XCUT 1,2
                     ;--XTDEF 3
         Then, the following code is generated from the above:
               typedef AmmRequest AddRequest

B.8.   XORDER
   Synopsis:
        ;--XORDER digit 1*(, digit)
   Example:
        CommandRequest = ["O-"] ["W-"] Command
              ;--XVAR 2=optional, 4=wildcardReturn, 5=command
              ;--XORDER 5,4,2      
        A struct sequence is generated as
        command, optional, wildcardReturn

B.9.   XNCASE
   Used to direct case-insensitivity, when strings compared.
   Synopsis:
        ;--XNCASE ncaseId *(, ncaseId)

B.10.  XLEN
  This specifies a length for an element name.
   Synopsis:
        ;--XLEN number
   Example:
        MessageBody = Token
               ;--XLEN ContentLength

B.11.  XDUP
   Used to specify byte values which the compiler can take.
   Synopsis:
        ;--XDUP <type id>=<hex-digit> *(, <hex-digit>)
   Example :
        CallId = ( "Call-ID" / "i" ) HCOLON Payload CRLF
                     ;--XCUT 2,3,4,6
                     ;--XNCASE 2,3
                     ;--XTDEF 5
                     ;--XDUP 3=0x20,0x09,0x3a
        Then, the following code can be generated:
               typedef Payload CallId
               typedef struct Payload {
                   xu16                   length;
                   xu8*                   value;
               } Payload;

B.12.  XALT
   This extension rule is used to assign a fall-back option
   Synopsis:
         ;--XALT <ext id>
         where <ext id> is a number
   Example :

         Host = Ipv4 / Ipv6 / HostName
                    ;--XALT 3
         HostName =  1*(Alphanum / "-"/ "." )
                    ;--XTYPE 0=char

B.13.  XTOK
   This extension rule is used only with the struct type name and does
   not appear in the generated user struct code.
   It has relation with decoding rule.
   Synopsis:
      ;--XTOK <tok id>
      where <tok id> is a number

B.14.  XSTRL
   This is used to appoint a char as delimiter if there exists no
   delimiter when one is needed.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XSTRL <ext id> = <byte> *(, <byte>)
       where <ext id> is a number and <byte> is a hex-digit.
   Example :
     ExtHdrList = 1*(ExtHdr)
      ;--XTYPE 0=structl
      ;--XSTRL 2=0x21,0x23-27,0x2a-2b,0x2d-2e,0x30-39,0x41-5a,0x5e-7a,
         0x7c,0x7e
      ;In this case, it specifies all the character suitable for ExtHdr
         = Token
                 ;
      ExtHdr = Token HCOLON 0*1Payload CRLF
                 ;--XCUT 2,4
                 ;--XVAR 1=mHdrName, 3=mHdrValue

B.15.  XNRPT
   Extension data are used as a general rule, when pre-conditions are
   not met. If extension data use XSTRL for its structl type, it's
   necessary to check if the pre-conditions are met by setting XNRPT
   to 1. The following example shows that once ExtHdr is met, there is
   a chance for it to continue to be met. To avoid this situation,
   it's forced to check Exthdr only after Acceptlist and ViaList are
   checked.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XNRPT <ext id>
       where <ext id> is a number
   Example :
      MsgHdrList   = *{
                              0*1AcceptList
                                ViaList
                              0*1ExtHdrList
                               } CRLF

Internet-Draft      ABNF Extensions for code generation         May 2009


      ExtHdrList = 1*(ExtHdr)
                    ;--XTYPE 0=structl
                    ;--XSTRL 2=0x41-5A,0x61-7A,0x30-39,0x2d,0x2e,0x21
                                 ,0x25, 0x2a,0x5f,0x2b,0x60,0x27,0x7e
                      ;--XNRPT 1
      ExtHdr = Token HCOLON Payload CRLF
                      ;--XCUT 2,4
                      ;--XVAR 1=mHdrName, 3=mHdrValue

B.16.  XFENC
   This extension rule is used when a variable needs to be overriden
   with a given value.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XFENC <ext id> = <value>
   where <exit id> and <value> are a number.
   Example:
       HCOLON  =  *( SP / HTAB ) ":" 0*1LWS
                            ;--XCUT 0
                            ;--XFENC 5=0x20
      LWS = [*WSP CRLFLWS] 1*WSP
                            ;--XCUT 0

B.17.  XNCMP
   This extension rule is used when the length in PDU rule and the
   size of the input stream are not to be compared.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XNCMP
   Example:
       SIPMessage = StartLine MsgHdrList
                         ;--XPDU
       StartLine  = *CRLF (StatusLine / ReqLine)
                     ;--XNLCMP
                     ;--XCUT 1
                     ;--XALT 4
                     ;--XCHOICE 3=SL_mStatus_chosen, 4=SL_mReq_chosen
