  Multiplexing Scheme Updates for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
     (SRTP) Extension for Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
                draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-11

Abstract

   This document defines how Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS),
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), RTP Control Protocol (RTCP),
   Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN), Traversal Using Relays
   around NAT (TURN), and ZRTP packets are multiplexed on a single
   receiving socket.  It overrides the guidance from RFC 5764 ("SRTP
   Extension for DTLS"), which suffered from four issues described and
   fixed in this document.

   This document updates RFC 5764.

1.  Introduction

   Section 5.1.2 of Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) Extension
   for DTLS [RFC5764] defines a scheme for a Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] receiver to demultiplex Datagram Transport
   Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347], Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
   (STUN) [RFC5389] and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
   (SRTP)/Secure RTP Control Protocol (SRTCP) [RFC3711] packets that are
   arriving on the RTP port.  Unfortunately, this demultiplexing scheme
   has created problematic issues:

   1.  It implicitly allocated codepoints for new STUN methods without
       an IANA registry reflecting these new allocations.

   2.  It did not take into account the fact that ZRTP [RFC6189] also
       needs to be demultiplexed with the other packet types explicitly
       mentioned in Section 5.1.2 of RFC 5764.

   3.  It implicitly allocated codepoints for new Transport Layer
       Security (TLS) ContentTypes without an IANA registry reflecting
       these new allocations.

   4.  It did not take into account the fact that the Traversal Using
       Relays around NAT (TURN) usage of STUN can create TURN channels
       that also need to be demultiplexed with the other packet types
       explicitly mentioned in Section 5.1.2 of RFC 5764.

Internet-Draft             RFC 5764 Mux Fixes             September 2016


   Having overlapping ranges between different IANA registries becomes
   an issue when a new codepoint is allocated in one of these registries
   without carefully analyzing the impact it could have on the other
   registries when that codepoint is demultiplexed.  Among other
   downsides of the bad design of the demultiplexing algorithm detailed
   in [RFC5764], it creates a requirement for coordination between
   codepoint assignments where none should exist, and that is
   organizationally and socially undesirable.  However, RFC 5764 has
   been widely deployed so there must be an awareness of this issue and
   how it must be dealt with.  Thus, even if the feature related to a
   codepoint is not initially thought to be useful in the context of
   demultiplexing, the respective IANA registry expert should at least
   raise a flag when the allocated codepoint irrevocably prevents
   multiplexing.

   The first goal of this document is to make sure that future
   allocations in any of the affected protocols are done with the full
   knowledge of their impact on multiplexing.  This is achieved by
   updating [RFC5764], which includes modifying the IANA registries with
   instructions for coordination between the protocols at risk.

   A second goal is to permit the addition of new protocols to the list
   of existing multiplexed protocols in a manner that does not break
   existing implementations.

   At the time of this writing, the flaws in the demultiplexing scheme
   were unavoidably inherited by other documents, such as [RFC7345] and
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].  So in addition, these and
   any other affected documents will need to be corrected with the
   updates this document provides.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Implicit Allocation of Codepoints for New STUN Methods

   The demultiplexing scheme in [RFC5764] states that the receiver can
   identify the packet type by looking at the first byte.  If the value
   of this first byte is 0 or 1, the packet is identified to be STUN.
   The problem that arises as a result of this implicit allocation is
   that this restricts the codepoints for STUN methods (as described in
   Section 18.1 of [RFC5389]) to values between 0x000 and 0x07F, which
   in turn reduces the number of possible STUN method codepoints
   assigned by IETF Review (i.e., the range from (0x000 - 0x7FF) from
   2048 to only 128 and eliminating the possibility of having STUN



Petit-Huguenin & SalgueiroExpires March 5, 2017                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             RFC 5764 Mux Fixes             September 2016


   method codepoints assigned by Designated Expert (i.e., the range
   0x800 - 0xFFF).

   To preserve the Designated Expert range, this document allocates the
   value 2 and 3 to also identify STUN methods.

   The IANA Registry for STUN methods is modified to mark the codepoints
   from 0x100 to 0xFFF as Reserved.  These codepoints can still be
   allocated, but require IETF Review with a document that will properly
   evaluate the risk of an assignment overlapping with other registries.

   In addition, this document also updates the IANA registry such that
   the STUN method codepoints assigned in the 0x080-0x0FF range are also
   assigned via Designated Expert.  The proposed changes to the STUN
   Method Registry are:

   OLD:

   0x000-0x7FF     IETF Review
   0x800-0xFFF     Designated Expert

   NEW:

   0x000-0x07F     IETF Review
   0x080-0x0FF     Designated Expert
   0x100-0xFFF     Reserved

4.  Multiplexing of ZRTP

   ZRTP [RFC6189] is a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange
   to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP
   (VoIP) applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because
   it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require
   support in the signaling protocol.

   In order to prevent future documents from assigning values from the
   unused range to a new protocol, this document modifies the [RFC5764]
   demultiplexing algorithm to properly account for ZRTP [RFC6189] by
   allocating the values from 16 to 19 for this purpose.

5.  Implicit Allocation of New Codepoints for TLS ContentTypes

   The demultiplexing scheme in [RFC5764] dictates that if the value of
   the first byte is between 20 and 63 (inclusive), then the packet is
   identified to be DTLS.  For DTLS 1.0 [RFC4347] and DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347]
   that first byte corresponds to the TLS ContentType field.
   Considerations must be taken into account when assigning additional



Petit-Huguenin & SalgueiroExpires March 5, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             RFC 5764 Mux Fixes             September 2016


   ContentTypes in the code point ranges 0 to 19 and 64 to 255 so this
   does not prevent demultiplexing when this functionality is desirable.
   Note that [RFC5764] describes a narrow use of DTLS that works as long
   as the specific DTLS version used abides by the restrictions on the
   demultiplexing byte (the ones that this document imposes on the TLS
   ContentType Registry).  Any extension or revision to DTLS that causes
   it to no longer meet these constraints should consider what values
   may occur in the first byte of the DTLS message and what impact it
   would have on the multiplexing that [RFC5764] describes.

   With respect to TLS packet identification, this document explicitly
   adds a warning to the codepoints from 0 to 19 and from 64 to 255
   indicating that allocations in these ranges require coordination, as
   described in this document.  The proposed changes to the TLS
   ContentType Registry are:

   OLD:

   0-19    Unassigned
   20      change_cipher_spec
   21      alert
   22      handshake
   23      application_data
   24      heartbeat
   25-255  Unassigned

   NEW:

   0-19    Unassigned (Requires coordination, see RFCXXXX)
   20      change_cipher_spec
   21      alert
   22      handshake
   23      application_data
   24      heartbeat
   25-63   Unassigned
   64-255  Unassigned (Requires coordination, see RFCXXXX)

6.  Multiplexing of TURN Channels

   When used with ICE [RFC5245], an RFC 5764 implementation can receive
   packets on the same socket from three different paths, as shown in
   Figure 1:

   1.  Directly from the source

   2.  Through a NAT

   3.  Relayed by a TURN server

         Figure 1: Packet Reception by an RFC 5764 Implementation

   Even if the ICE algorithm succeeded in selecting a non-relayed path,
   it is still possible to receive data from the TURN server.  For
   instance, when ICE is used with aggressive nomination the media path
   can quickly change until it stabilizes.  Also, freeing ICE candidates
   is optional, so the TURN server can restart forwarding STUN
   connectivity checks during an ICE restart.

   TURN channels are an optimization where data packets are exchanged
   with a 4-byte prefix, instead of the standard 36-byte STUN overhead
   (see Section 2.5 of [RFC5766]).  The problem is that the RFC 5764
   demultiplexing scheme does not define what to do with packets
   received over a TURN channel since these packets will start with a
   first byte whose value will be between 64 and 127 (inclusive).  If
   the TURN server was instructed to send data over a TURN channel, then
   the current RFC 5764 demultiplexing scheme will reject these packets.
   Current implementations violate RFC 5764 for values 64 to 127
   (inclusive) and they instead parse packets with such values as TURN.

   In order to prevent future documents from assigning values from the
   unused range to a new protocol, this document modifies the RFC 5764
   demultiplexing algorithm to properly account for TURN channels by
   allocating the values from 64 to 79 for this purpose.  This
   modification restricts the TURN channel space to a more limited set
   of possible channels when the TURN client does the channel binding
   request in combination with the demultiplexing scheme described in
   [RFC5764].

7.  RFC 5764 Updates

   This document updates the text in Section 5.1.2 of [RFC5764] as
   follows:

   OLD TEXT

   The process for demultiplexing a packet is as follows.  The receiver
   looks at the first byte of the packet.  If the value of this byte is
   0 or 1, then the packet is STUN.  If the value is in between 128 and
   191 (inclusive), then the packet is RTP (or RTCP, if both RTCP and
   RTP are being multiplexed over the same destination port).  If the
   value is between 20 and 63 (inclusive), the packet is DTLS.  This
   process is summarized in Figure 3.

             +----------------+
             | 127 < B < 192 -+--> forward to RTP
             |                |
 packet -->  |  19 < B < 64  -+--> forward to DTLS
             |                |
             |       B < 2   -+--> forward to STUN
             +----------------+

          Here the field B denotes the leading byte of the packet.

   END OLD TEXT

   NEW TEXT

   The process for demultiplexing a packet is as follows.  The receiver
   looks at the first byte of the packet.  If the value of this byte is
   in between 0 and 3 (inclusive), then the packet is STUN.  If the
   value is between 16 and 19 (inclusive), then the packet is ZRTP.  If
   the value is between 20 and 63 (inclusive), then the packet is DTLS.
   If the value is between 64 and 79 (inclusive), then the packet is
   TURN Channel.  If the value is in between 128 and 191 (inclusive),
   then the packet is RTP (or RTCP, if both RTCP and RTP are being
   multiplexed over the same destination port).  If the value does not
   match any known range then the packet MUST be dropped and an alert
   MAY be logged.  This process is summarized in Figure 3.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document updates existing IANA registries and adds a new range
   for TURN channels in the demuxing algorithm.

   These modifications do not introduce any specific security
   considerations beyond those detailed in [RFC5764].

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  STUN Methods

   This specification contains the registration information for reserved
   STUN Methods codepoints, as explained in Section 3 and in accordance
   with the procedures defined in Section 18.1 of [RFC5389].

   Value:   0x100-0xFFF

   Name:   Reserved (MUST be allocated with IETF Review.  For DTLS-SRTP
      multiplexing collision avoidance see RFCXXXX)

   Reference:   RFC5764, RFCXXXX

   This specification also reassigns the ranges in the STUN Methods
   Registry as follow:

A.9.  Modifications between draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-03 and
      draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-02

   o  Revert to the RFC 5389, as the stunbis reference was needed only
      for STUN over SCTP.

A.10.  Modifications between draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-02 and
       draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-01

   o  Remove any discussion about SCTP until a consensus emerges in
      TRAM.

A.11.  Modifications between draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-01 and
       draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-00

   o  Instead of allocating the values that are common on each registry,
      the specification now only reserves them, giving the possibility
      to allocate them in case muxing is irrelevant.

   o  STUN range is now 0-3m with 2-3 being Designated Expert.

   o  TLS ContentType 0-19 and 64-255 are now reserved.

   o  Add SCTP over UDP value.

   o  If an implementation uses the source IP address/port to separate
      TURN channels packets then the whole channel numbers are
      available.

   o  If not the prefix is between 64 and 79.

   o  First byte test order is now by incremental values, so failure is
      deterministic.

   o  Redraw the demuxing diagram.

A.12.  Modifications between draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-00 and
       draft-petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes-02

   o  Adoption by WG.

   o  Add reference to STUNbis.
