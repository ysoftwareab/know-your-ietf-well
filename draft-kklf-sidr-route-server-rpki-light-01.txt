Signaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from a Route-Server to Peers
               draft-kklf-sidr-route-server-rpki-light-01

Abstract

   This document defines the usage of the BGP Prefix Origin Validation
   State Extended Community [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling]
   to signal prefix origin validation results from a route-server to its
   peers.  Upon reception of prefix origin validation results peers can
   use this information in their local routing decision process.

1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based route origin validation [RFC6480] can be a significant
   operational burden for BGP peers to implement and adopt.  In order to
   boost acceptance and usage of RPKI and ultimately increase the
   security of the Internet routing system, IXPs may provide RPKI-based
   prefix origin validation at the route-server
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server].  The result of this route origin
   validation is signaled to peers by using the BGP Prefix Origin
   Validation State Extended Community as introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling].

   Peers receiving the route origin validation result from the route-
   server(s) can use this information in their local routing decision
   process for acceptance, rejection, preference, or other traffic
   engineering purposes of a particular route.

2.  Signaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from a Route-Server to
    Peers

   The BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community (as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling]) is utilized for
   signaling prefix origin validation result from a route-server to
   peers.

   [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling] proposes an encoding of
   the prefix origin validation result [RFC6811] as follows:

                           +-------+-----------+
                           | Value | Meaning   |
                           +-------+-----------+
                           |   0   | Valid     |
                           |   1   | Not found |
                           |   2   | Invalid   |
                           +-------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

   This encoding is re-used.  Route-servers providing RPKI-based origin
   origin validation set the validation state according to the prefix
   origin validation result (see [RFC6811]).

3.  Operational Recommendations

3.1.  Local Routing Decision Process

   A peer receiving prefix origin validation result from the route
   server MAY use the information in its own local routing decision
   process.  The local routing decision process SHOULD apply to the
   rules as described in section 5 [RFC6811].

   A peer receiving a prefix origin validation result from the route
   server MAY redistribute this information within its own AS.

3.2.  Route-Server Receiving the BGP Prefix Origin Validation State
      Extended Community

   An IXP route-server receiving routes from its peers containing the
   BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community MUST remove the
   extended community before the route is re-distributed to its peers.
   This is required regardless of whether the route-server is executing
   prefix origin validation or not.

   Failure to do so would allow opportunistic peers to advertise routes
   tagged with arbitrary prefix origin validation results via a route-

   server, influencing maliciously the decision process of other route-
   server peers.

3.3.  Error Handling at Peers

   A route sent by a route-server SHOULD only contain none or one BGP
   Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community.

   A peer receiving a route from a route-server containing more than one
   BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community SHOULD only
   consider the largest value (as described in Table 1) in the
   validation result field and disregard the other values.  Values
   larger than two in the validation result field MUST be disregarded.

4.  IANA Considerations

   None.

5.  Security Considerations

   A route-server could be misused to spread malicious prefix origin
   validation results.  However, peers have to trust the route-server
   anyway as it collects and redistributes BGP routing information to
   other peers.

   The introduction of a mechanisms described in this document does not
   pose a new class of attack vectors to the relationship between route-
   servers and peers.
