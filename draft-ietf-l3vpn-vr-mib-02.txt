5.0 Introduction

This memo defines a MIB for the Virtual Router [PPVPN-VR, PPVPN-VR-AS]
model of Provider Provisioned VPNs [PPVPN-FW].

Following are the goals, in defining this MIB:

  - To have a means for Service Providers to provision VPN service for
    subscribers, at the PE device.

  - To make the agent-side implementation simple, by not modifying the
    existing standard MIBs.

  - Define all the gluing tables that are needed toward this end.

6.0  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
2580 [RFC2580].


7.0 Overview of the Virtual Router MIB



7.1 SNMP Contexts for Management for Virtual Routers

There is a need for a single agent to manage multiple Virtual Routers.
The Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks [RFC3411]
provides a way to support such cases.

Managing multiple virtual routers requires that the PE management plane be
subdivided into logical VR management domains.  In the VR model of PPVPNs
a single PE device may contain many virtual routers.  Different management
entities SHOULD be able to manage specific virtual routers and associated
services. The Service Provider MUST be able to manage all virtual routers
and associated services.


Using SNMP contexts to group a collection of management information
provides the following benefits:

 (1)   Uses a standard framework defined by the IETF, allowing the
      product to remain flexible to all implementations of virtual
      router devices.

      (a) Use SNMPv2c Community String's

      (b) Use SNMPv3 contextName's

(2)   Prevents vendors from having to  modify the
      standard MIBs, allowing the implementation to remain standards
      compliant.

 (3)   Provides a framework that will work for RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP,
      IP-FORWARDING, MPLS, and any other MIB that can be administratively

      grouped with a VR.

The SNMP context for the Virtual Router instance can be specified in
the VrConfigTable.  The VrContextName columnar object is used to set the
SNMPv2c Community String or the SNMPv3 contextName for a given VR.

A virtual router context represents the set of MIB objects that could be
administratively grouped within a VR.  For example, each VR would maintain
its own instance of routing protocol MIB tables. However, the ADMIN context
would contain single instances of objects and tables that pertain to system
wide configuration such as the Entity, Interfaces, and ATM MIBs.

A management system using the SNMP context of a particular virtual
router MUST be able to manage the virtual router without disrupting other
virtual routers in the same PE device.

For example, a PE can be subdivided into two 2 VRs running the OSPF routing
protocol.  Each VR will maintain a unique instance of the OSPF-MIB.
Therefore, the ospfAreaTable of VR-A is distinct from the
ospfAreaTable of VR-B.

Draft                        Virtual Router MIB                  July 2004

Filtering mechanisms based on the SNMP context of a particular virtual router
may implemented to allow different management entities to manage those objects
and services provisioned the 'Admin' context.



7.2 VR Indexing

While the standard protocol MIB tables are instantiated in the
context specified using SNMP contexts, there may be tables that are
defined with the VRID as index.

The VRID is of local significance to a particular PE device, and need
not be globally unique. Thus a particular VRID value assigned to a VR
in one PE device may indicate a different VR in another PE device.

The VRID has an Unsigned32 value, and this value is assigned by the management
station. To aid the management station in assigning a VRID without conflict,
the management station can get the 'NextAvailableVRID' from the PE device.
A SNMP manager SHOULD NOT assume global significance of any VRID value
other than 0.


For those MIB tables instantiated in the virtual router context, indexing can
only be assumed unique for that particular VR.  However those indices in the
"ADMIN" context are unique across the entire system, including all VRs.



7.3 Creation and Deletion of VRs

The VR Config Table is used for this purpose. This is a read-create
table and adding an entry into this table will create a VR. Removing
an entry from this table marks the deletion of a VR.

VRID 0 is assigned to the Administrative VR, which exists by default,
and need not be created. Deletion of the Administrative VR will not be
permitted.  The VRID of the Administrative VR (VRID 0) should be a
reserved VRID number.  VRID 0 could be termed the "null VR" and it could
be the context that manages the resource pool of unattached interfaces.
Routing would then not exist in the context of Administrative VR.



7.4 Administrative and Operational Status of VRs

VRs can be administratively turned down. When this is done, no
packet forwarding via the VR takes place.

VrOperStatus denotes the operational status of a VR. Currently the
VrOperStatus is expected to change along the VrAdminStatus unless an
error condition exists.

Draft                        Virtual Router MIB                  July 2004

7.5 Binding interfaces to a VR

Interfaces are bound to a VR, using vrIfConfigTable. This is
a read-write table, and note that interfaces are not created through
this table. The vrIfConfigTable MIB table is used to indicated the
relationship between interfaces and virtual router IDs. For each
interface present in the system, this table is used to provide the
mapping from IfIndex to a unique VR.  The table show which interfaces
are –attached or connected• to a virtual router. An interface can not
be attached to more than one VR.

The "Admin" VR could be used to manage the resource pool of
unattached interfaces.  However interfaces would not be attached to
VRID 0.

7.6 Setting per VR limits

VRs consume resources on a device, and hence the following parameters
defined in vrConfigTable are used to specify an upper bound of resource
utilization:

VrMaxRoutes -
Specify the maximum number of routes that will be permitted
in VR. This includes all routes, such as the statically configured routes,
and the routes learnt via dynamic routing protocols.

7.7 Per VR Statistics

In addition to those statistics available through the VR instantiated MIB
tables, there are some per-VR statistics available through vrStatTable.

7.8 Traps

This memo defines that VrUp and VrDown traps are generated just after
VrOperStatus leaves, or just before it enters, the down state,
respectively.

   (1)   A transition into the down state will occur when an error is
         detected on a VR instance.

   (2)   Departing the down state generally indicates that the
         VR is going to up, which is considered a "healthy" state.

An exception to the above generation of VrUp/VrDown traps on changes
in VrOperStatus, occurs when an VR is "flapping", i.e., when it is
rapidly oscillating between the up and down states.  If traps were
generated for each such oscillation, the network and the network
management system would be flooded with unnecessary traps.  In such a
situation, the agent should limit the rate at which it generates traps.

This memo defines that enabling and disabling the VR traps is achieved
by setting the VrTrapEnable to true(1) or false(2), respectively.  By
default, this object should have the value true(1).

8.0 Sample VR MIB Configuration Scenario

8.1 Creation of a VR

Creating VR instances can be achieved using the following example.

(1) Get the next available Virtual Router Id using the
    NextAvailableVrId, to create a VR:

    Using a context with 'read' access for system level entities.
    GetRequest { NextAvailableVrId.0 }
    Response   { NextAvailableVrId.0  =  5555 }

 (2) In VrConfigTable, create VR Instance using VrRowStatus:

    Using a context with 'read-write' access for system level entities
    SetRequest {
        VrRowStatus.5555                   createAndGo(4),
        VrName.5555                        "BigTelcoVR",
        VrContextName.5555                 "vr5555",
        VrTrapEnable.5555                  true(1),
        VrAdminStatus.5555                 up(1)

11.0 Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
sensitivity/vulnerability:

The Administrative VR provides visibility into and control over multiple
VPNs. As such, security considerations for implementations of the
Administrative VR and associated control plane(s) are critical to the
security of the VPNs supported on each PE device.

Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
sensitivity/vulnerability:

Use of any vrContextName MUST be allowed in the Administrative VR.
Additional authentication and security mechanisms SHOULD be used for SNMP
access in the Administrative VR.

Draft                        Virtual Router MIB                  July 2004


VRs other than the Administrative VR MUST NOT have access to other VR's
Instantiated MIBs, and MAY have access to their own instantiated MIBs.

In VRs other than the Administrative VR, access to that VR's instantiated
MIBs MAY be permitted via that VR's vrContextName. Use of any vrContextName
other than that assigned to the accessed VR MUST result in an error, and
implementations SHOULD provide a logging mechanism for such events.

SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
in this MIB module.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
authentication and privacy).

Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
