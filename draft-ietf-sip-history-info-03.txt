 Abstract  
    
   This draft defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history 
   information associated with a SIP request.  This capability enables 
   many enhanced services by providing the information as to how and why 
   a call arrives at a specific application or user.  This draft defines 
   a new optional SIP header, History-Info, for capturing the history 
   information in requests. A new option tag, Histinfo, to be included 
   in the Supported header, is defined to allow UAs to indicate whether 
   the History-Info should be returned in responses to a request which 
   has captured the history information. A new priv-value, history, is

 Overview  
        
   Many services that SIP is anticipated to support require the ability 
   to determine why and how the call arrived at a specific application.  
   Examples of such services include (but are not limited to) sessions 
   initiated to call centers via "click to talk" SIP URLs on a web page, 
   "call history/logging" style services within intelligent "call 
   management" software for SIP UAs and calls to voicemail servers and 
   call centers.  While SIP implicitly provides the redirect/retarget 
   capabilities that enable calls to be routed to chosen applications, 
   there is currently no standard mechanism within SIP for communicating 
   the history of such a request. This "request history" information 
   allows the receiving application to determine hints about how and why 
   the call arrived at the application/user. This draft defines a new 
   SIP header, History-Info, to provide a standard mechanism for 
   capturing the request history information to enable a wide variety of

   services for networks and end users.  The History-Info header 
   provides a building block for development of new services.   
   
   Section 1 provides additional background motivation for the Request 
   History capability.  Section 2 identifies the requirements for a 
   solution, with Section 3 providing an overall description of the 
   solution. 
    
   Section 4 provides the details of the additions to the SIP protocol.  
   Example uses of the new header are included in Section 4.5, with 
   additional scenarios included in the Appendix. It is anticipated that 
   these would be moved and progressed in a general Service examples 
   draft such as [SIPSVCEX] or individual informational drafts 
   describing these specific services, since the History-Info header is 
   just one of the building blocks for implementing these services. 
   Individual drafts would be particularly useful for documenting 
   services for which there are multiple solutions, as it is not the 
   intent, nor is it within the scope, of this draft to prescribe a 
   complete solution for any of these applications.    
    
   Section 5 summarizes the application considerations identified in the 
   previous sections. Section 6 summarizes the security solution.

 1.Background:  Why define a Generic "Request History" capability? 
 
   SIP implicitly provides redirect/retarget capabilities that enable 
   calls to be routed to specific applications as defined in [RFC3261]. 
   The term retarget will be used henceforth in this draft to refer to 
   the process of a Proxy Server/UAC changing a URI in a request and 
   thus changing the target of the request.  This term is chosen to 
   avoid associating this request history only with the specific SIP 
   Redirect Server capability that provides for a response to be sent 
   back to a UAC requesting that the UAC should retarget the original 
   request to an alternate URI.  The rules for determining request 
   targets as described in section 16.5 of [RFC3261] are consistent with 
   the use of the retarget term in this draft.

   The motivation for the request history is that in the process of 
   retargeting old routing information can be forever lost. This lost 
   information may be important history that allows elements to which 
   the call is retargeted to process the call in a locally defined, 
   application specific manner. The proposal in this draft is to provide 
   a mechanism for transporting the request history.  It is not 
   proposing any application specific behavior for a Proxy or UA upon 
   receipt of the information. Indeed, such behavior should be a local 
   decision for the recipient application. 
    
   Current network applications provide the ability for elements 
   involved with the call to exchange additional information relating to 
   how and why the call was routed to a particular destination.  The 
   following are examples of such applications:  
    
  1. Web "referral" applications, whereby an application residing 
     within a web server determines that a visitor to a website has 
     arrived at the site via an "associate" site which will receive 
     some "referral" commission for generating this traffic,  
    
  2. Email forwarding whereby the forwarded-to user obtains a "history" 
     of who sent the email to whom and at what time 
           
  3. Traditional telephony services such as Voicemail, call-center 
     "automatic call distribution", and "follow-me" style services. 
 
     
   Several of the aforementioned applications currently define 
   application specific mechanisms through which it is possible to 
   obtain the necessary history information.   
    
   In addition, request history information could be used to enhance 
   basic SIP functionality by providing the following: 
    
  4. Some diagnostic information for debugging SIP requests. 
     
  5. A stronger security solution for SIP. A side effect is that each 
     proxy which captures the "request history" information in a secure 
     manner provides an additional means (without requiring signed keys) 
     for the original requestor to be assured that the request was 
     properly retargeted.    
    
 
 2. "Request History" Requirements 
 
   The following list constitutes a set of requirements for a "Request 
   History" capability.

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   1) CAPABILITY-req:  The "Request History" capability provides a 
   capability to inform proxies and UAs involved in processing a request 
   about the history/progress of that request. While this is inherently 
   provided when the retarget is in response to a SIP redirect, it is 
   deemed useful for non-redirect retargeting scenarios, as well.  
    
   2) OPTIONALITY-req: The "Request History" information is optional.  
    
   2.1) In many cases, it is anticipated that whether the history is 
   added to the Request would be a local policy decision enforced by the 
   specific application, thus no specific protocol element is needed.   
    
   2.2) Due to the capability being "optional" from the SIP protocol 
   perspective, the impact to an application of not having the "Request 
   History" must be described. Applicability guidelines to be addressed 
   by applications using this capability must be provided as part of the 
   solution to these requirements.  
    
    
   3) GENERATION-req: "Request History" information is generated when 
   the request is retargeted. 
    
   3.1) In some scenarios, it might be possible for more than one 
   instance of retargeting to occur within the same Proxy.  A proxy 
   should also generate Request History information for the 'internal 
   retargeting'. 
    
   3.2) An entity (UA or proxy) retargeting in response to a redirect or 
   REFER should include any Request History information from the 
   redirect/REFER in the new request. 
 
 
   4) ISSUER-req: "Request History" information can be generated by a UA 
   or proxy. It can be passed in both requests and responses. 
    
    
   5) CONTENT-req:  The "Request History" information for each 
   occurrence of retargeting, shall include the following: 
    
     5.1) The new URI or address to which the request is in the process          
     of being retargeted, 
      
     5.2) The URI or address from which the request was retargeted, 
      
     5.3) The reason for the Request-URI or address modification,  
       
     5.4) Chronological ordering of the Request History information.

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   6) REQUEST-VALIDITY-req:  Request-History is applicable to requests 
   not sent within an established dialog. (i.e. INVITE, REGISTER, 
   MESSAGE, and OPTIONS).  
    
   7) BACKWARDS-req: Request-History information may be passed from the 
   generating entity backwards towards the UAC. This is needed to enable 
   services that inform the calling party about the dialog establishment 
   attempts.    
    
   8) FORWARDS-req:  Request-History information may also be included by 
   the generating entity in the request, if it is forwarded onwards. 
    
 2.1 Security Requirements 
  
   The Request History information is being inserted by a network 
   element retargeting a Request, resulting in a slightly different 
   problem than the basic SIP header problem, thus requiring specific 
   consideration.  It is recognized that these security requirements can 
   be generalized to a basic requirement of being able to secure 
   information that is inserted by proxies.  
    
   The potential security problems include the following: 
   1) A rogue application could insert a bogus Request History entry 
   either by adding an additional entry as a result of retargeting or 
   entering invalid information.  
 
   2) A rogue application could re-arrange the Request History 
   information to change the nature of the end application or to mislead 
   the receiver of the information.  
 
   Thus, a security solution for "Request History" must meet the 
   following requirements: 
    
   1) SEC-req-1: The entity receiving the Request History must be able 
   to determine whether any of the previously added Request History 
   content has been altered.  
    
   2) SEC-req-2: The ordering of the Request History information must be 
   preserved at each instance of retargeting.  
 
   3) SEC-req-3: The entity receiving the information conveyed by the 
   Request History must be able to authenticate the source of the 
   information.   
    
   4) SEC-req-4: To ensure the confidentiality of the Request History 
   information, only entities which process the request should have 
   visibility to the information.

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   It should be noted that these security requirements apply to any 
   entity making use of the Request History information, either by 
   retargeting and capturing the information, or as an application 
   making use of the information received in either a Request or 
   Response. 
 
 2.2 Privacy Requirements 
 
   Since the Request URI that is captured could inadvertently reveal 
   information about the originator, there are general privacy 
   requirements that MUST be met: 
    
   1) PRIV-req-1: The entity retargeting the Request must ensure that it 
   maintains the network-provided privacy (as described in [RFC3323]) 
   associated with the Request as it is retargeted. 
    
   2) PRIV-req-2: The entity receiving the Request History must maintain 
   the privacy associated with the information.   
    
   In addition, local policy at a proxy may identify privacy 
   requirements associated with the Request URI being captured in the 
   Request History information.  
    
   3) PRIV-req-3: Request History information subject to privacy 
   requirements shall not be included in outgoing messages unless it is 
   protected as described in [RFC3323]. 
    
 
 
 3. Request History Information Description 
 
   The fundamental functionality provided by the request history 
   information is the ability to inform proxies and UAs involved in 
   processing a request about the history or progress of that request 
   [CAPABILITY-req].  The solution is to capture the Request-URIs as a 
   request is forwarded in a new header for SIP messages: History-Info 
   [CONTENT-req].  This allows for the capturing of the history of a 
   request that would be lost with the normal SIP processing involved in 
   the subsequent forwarding of the request. This solution proposes no 
   changes in the fundamental determination of request targets or in the 
   request forwarding as defined in sections 16.5 and 16.6 of the SIP 
   protocol specification [RFC3261].  
    
   The History-Info header can appear in any request not associated with 
   an established dialog, which includes INVITE, REGISTER, MESSAGE, 
   REFER and OPTIONS [REQUEST-VALIDITY-req] and any valid response to 
   these requests.[ISSUER-req]

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   The History-Info header is added to a Request when a new request is 
   created by a UAC or Proxy, or when the target of a request is 
   changed. The term 'retarget' is introduced to refer to this changing 
   of the target of a request and the subsequent forwarding of that 
   request. It should be noted that retargeting only occurs when the 
   Request-URI indicates a domain for which the processing entity is 
   responsible.  In terms of the SIP protocol, the processing associated 
   with retargeting is described in sections 16.5, and 16.6 of 
   [RFC3261].  As described in section 16.5 of [RFC3261], it is possible 
   for the target of a request to be changed by the same proxy multiple 
   times (referred to as 'internal retargeting' in section 2), as the 
   proxy MAY add targets to the target set after beginning Request 
   Forwarding. Section 16.6 of [RFC3261] describes Request Forwarding. 
   It is during this process of Request Forwarding, that the History 
   Information is captured as an optional, additional header field. 
   Thus, the addition of the History-Info header does not impact 
   fundamental SIP Request Forwarding. An entity (UA or proxy) changing 
   the target of a request in response to a redirect or REFER SHOULD 
   also propagate any History-Info header from the initial Request in 
   the new request [GENERATION-req, FORWARDS-req]. 
      
 3.1 Optionality of History-Info 
      
   The History-Info header is optional in that neither UAs nor Proxies 
   are required to support it.  A new Supported header, Histinfo, is 
   included in the Request to indicate whether the History-Info header 
   is returned in Responses [BACKWARDS-req]. In addition to the Histinfo 
   Supported header, local policy determines whether or not the header 
   is added to any request, or for a specific Request-URI, being 
   retargeted. It is possible that this could restrict the applicability 
   of services which make use of the Request History Information to be 
   limited to retargeting within domain(s) controlled by the same local 
   policy, or between domain(s) which negotiate policies with other 
   domains to ensure support of the given policy, or services for which 
   "complete" History Information isn't required to provide the service. 
   [OPTIONALITY-req]  All applications making use of the History-info 
   header MUST clearly define the impact of the information not being 
   available and specify the processing of such a request.  
    
 3.2 Securing History-Info 
    
   This draft defines a new header for SIP. The draft RECOMMENDs the use 
   of TLS as a mandatory mechanism to ensure the overall confidentiality 
   of the History-Info headers [SEC-req-4]. This results in History-Info 
   having at least the same level of security as other headers in SIP 
   which are inserted by intermediaries. With the level of security 
   provided by TLS [SEC-req-3], the information in the History-Info 
   header can thus be evaluated to determine if information has been 
   removed by evaluating the indices for gaps [SEC-req-1, SEC-req-2].  
 
 
 Barnes                Expires January 8, 2005               [Page 8] 
                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   It would be up to the application to define whether it can make use 
   of the information in the case of missing entries.  
    
   A more robust security solution would need to consider the aspects of 
   the problem that are different than the hop by hop security problem 
   solved by TLS, as each hop is not required to add the History-Info 
   header.  History-Info also introduces a slightly different problem 
   than the basic SIP header or Identity [SIPATHID] problems, which is 
   focused on securing the information in the initial request end to 
   end. The History-Info header is being inserted by an entity as it 
   targets and forwards a Request, thus the requirements for the 
   security solution are similar to the Via and Record-Route headers.   
   For the History-Info header, the general requirement is to secure a 
   header that is inserted by an intermediary and then subsequently 
   referenced, by other intermediaries to build the next header entry, 
   or by an end application using the information to provide a service.  
    
   Thus, the general requirement for a more robust security solution for 
   SIP takes the form of a middle to middle and middle to end security 
   solution, which is addressed in a separate document [SIPIISEC]. The 
   use of the middle-to-end security solution discussed in [SIPIISEC] 
   allows the integrity of the History-Info to be ascertained as it 
   traverses the intermediaries.  Thus, including the History-Info 
   header in SIP Requests and securing in this manner would add an 
   additional level of security end to end, assuring the initiator of a 
   Request that it has indeed reached the intended recipient.   
 
 3.3 Ensuring the Privacy of History-Info 
    
   Since the History-Info header can inadvertently reveal information 
   about the requestor as described in [RFC3323], the Privacy header 
   SHOULD be used to determine whether an intermediary can include the 
   History-Info header in a Request that it receives and forwards [PRIV-
   req-2] or that it retargets [PRIV-req-1]. Thus, the History-Info 
   header SHOULD not be included in Requests where the requestor has 
   indicated a priv-value of Session or Header level privacy. 
      
   In addition, the History-Info header can reveal general routing 
   information, which may be viewed by a specific intermediary or 
   network, to be subject to privacy restrictions.  Thus, local policy 
   MAY also be used to determine whether to include the History-Info 
   header at all, whether to capture a specific Request-URI in the 
   header, or whether it be included only in the Request as it is 
   retargeted within a specific domain. [PRIV-req-3]  This is 
   accomplished by adding a new priv-value to the Privacy header [RFC 
   3323] indicating whether any or a specific History-Info header(s) 
   SHOULD be forwarded.

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   It is recognized that satisfying the privacy requirements can impact 
   the functionality of this solution by overriding the request to 
   generate the information. As with the optionality and security 
   requirements, applications making use of History-Info SHOULD address 
   any impact this may have. 
 
 4 Request History Information Protocol Details 
   
   This section contains the details and usage of the proposed new SIP 
   protocol elements.  It also discusses the security aspects of the 
   solution.   
 
 4.1 Protocol Structure of History-Info 
    
   History-Info is a header field as defined by [RFC3261].  It is an 
   optional header field and MAY appear in any request or response not 
   associated with a dialog or which starts a dialog. For example, 
   History-Info MAY appear in INVITE, REGISTER, MESSAGE, REFER and 
   OPTIONS and any valid responses, plus NOTIFY requests which initiate 
   a dialog.   
    
   The History-Info header carries the following information, with the 
   mandatory parameters REQUIRED when the header is included a request 
   or response: 
    
     o Targeted-to-URI (hi-targeted-to-uri): A mandatory parameter for 
        capturing the Request URI for the specific Request as it is 
        forwarded.   
    
     o Index (hi-index): A mandatory parameter for History-Info 
        reflecting the chronological order of the information, indexed 
        to also reflect the forking and nesting of requests. The format 
        for this parameter is a string of digits, separated by dots to 
        indicate the number of forward hops and retargets. This results 
        in a tree representation of the history of the request, with the 
        lowest level index reflecting a branch of the tree. By including 
        the index and securing the header, the ordering of the History-
        info headers in the request is assured.[SEC-req-2]  In addition, 
        applications MAY extract a variety of metrics (total number of 
        retargets, total number of retargets from a specific branch, 
        etc.) based upon the index values.  
 
     o Reason: An optional parameter for History-info, reflected in the 
        History-Info header by including the Reason Header [RFC3326] 
        escaped in the Request URI being retargeted.  A reason is not 
        included for a Request URI when it is first added in a History-
        info header, but rather is added when that particular Request-
        URI is retargeted.  Note, that this does appear to complicate 
        the security problem, however, retargeting only occurs when the

        Request-URI indicates a domain for which the processing entity 
        is responsible, thus it would be the same processing entity that 
        initially added the Request-URI to the header that would be 
        updating it with the Reason. 
 
     o Privacy: An optional parameter for History-info, reflected in 
        the History-Info header by including the Privacy Header 
        [RFC3323] with a priv-value of "history" escaped in the Request 
        URI or by adding the Privacy header with a priv-value of 
        "history" to the Request.  The use of the Privacy Header with a 
        priv-value of "history" indicates whether a specific or all 
        History-Info headers SHOULD NOT be forwarded. 
 
     o  Extension (hi-extension): An optional parameter to allow for     
       future optional extensions.  As per the [RFC3261], any 
       implementation not understanding an extension SHOULD ignore it. 
      
   The following summarizes the syntax of the History-Info header, based 
   upon the standard SIP syntax [RFC3261]:  
                                                                         
          History-Info = "History-Info" HCOLON  
    
                            hist-info *(COMMA hist-info) 
    
          hist-info = hi-targeted-to-uri *( SEMI hi-param ) 
    
          hi-targeted-to-uri= name-addr 
    
          hi-param = hi-index / hi-extension

 4.3 Protocol usage 
    
   This section describes the processing specific to UAs and Proxies for 
   the History-Info header, the Histinfo option tag and the priv-value 
   of "history". As discussed in section 1, the fundamental objective is 
   to capture the target Request-URIs as a request is forwarded.  This 
   allows for the capturing of the history of a request that would be 
   lost due to subsequent (re)targeting and forwarding.  To accomplish 
   this for the entire history of a request, either the UAC must capture 
   the Request-URI in the initial request or a proxy must add History-
   Info headers for both the Request-URI in the initial request and the 
   target Request-URI as the request is forwarded.  The basic processing 
   is for each entity forwarding a request to add a History-Info header 
   for the target Request-URI, updating the index and adding the Reason 
   as appropriate for any retargeted Request-URI.  
 
   4.3.1 UAC Behavior 
    
   The UAC SHOULD include the Histinfo option tag in the Supported 
   header in any request not associated with an established dialog for 
   which the UAC would like the History-Info in the Response.  In 
   addition, the UAC SHOULD initiate the capturing of the History 
   Information by adding a History-Info header using the Request-URI of 
   the request as the hi-targeted-to-uri and initializing the index to 
   the RECOMMENDED value of 1 in the History-Info header.   
    
   In the case where the request is routed to a redirect server and the 
   UAC receives a 3xx response with a Contact header, the UAC MAY 
   maintain the previous History-Info entry(-ies) in the request. A new 
   History-Info entry MAY then be added for the URI from the Contact 
   header (which will become the new Request-URI). In this case, the

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   index is created by reading and incrementing the value of the index 
   from the previous history entry, thus following the same rules as 
   those prescribed for a proxy in retargeting, described in section 
   4.3.3.1.3. An example of this scenario can be found in Appendix D.  
    
   A UAC that does not want History-Info headers added due to privacy 
   considerations SHOULD include a Privacy header with a priv-value(s) 
   of "session", "header" or "history" in the request.  
    
   The processing of the History-Info header received in the Response is 
   application specific and outside the scope of this draft. However, 
   the validity of the information SHOULD be ensured prior to any 
   application usage.  For example, the entries MAY be evaluated to 
   determine gaps in indices, which could indicate that an entry has 
   been maliciously removed or removed for privacy reasons.  Either way, 
   an application MAY want to be notified of potentially missing 
   information.  
    
    
   4.3.2 UAS Behavior 
    
   The processing of the History-Info header by a UAS in a Request 
   depends upon local policy and specific applications at the UAS which 
   might make use of the information.  Prior to any application usage of 
   the information, the validity SHOULD be ascertained.  For example, 
   the entries MAY be evaluated to determine gaps in indices, which 
   could indicate that an entry has been maliciously removed or removed 
   for privacy reasons.  Either way, an application MAY want to be 
   notified of potentially missing information.  
    
   If the Histinfo option tag is received in a request, the UAS should 
   include any History-Info received in the request in the subsequent 
   response.     
 
 
   4.3.3 Proxy Behavior 
    
   The inclusion of the History-Info header in a Request does not alter 
   the fundamental processing of proxies for determining request targets 
   as defined in section 16.5 of [RFC3261].  Whether a proxy adds the 
   the History-Info header as it forwards a Request depends upon the 
   following considerations: 
       1. Whether the Request contains the Histinfo option tag in the 
          Supported header.  
       2. Whether the proxy supports the History-Info header. 
       3. Whether the Request contains a Privacy header with a priv-
          value of "session", "header" or "history".  
       4. Whether any History-Info header added for a proxy/domain 
          should go outside that domain.  An example being the use of

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
          the History-Info header within the specific domain in which 
          it is retargeted, however, policies (for privacy, user and 
          network security, etc.) prohibit the exposure of that 
          information outside that domain.  A proxy MAY insert the 
          Privacy header with a priv-value of "history" to indicate 
          this. An example of such an application is provided in 
          Appendix C. 
       5. Whether the History-Info header is added for a specific 
          Request URI due to local privacy policy considerations.  A 
          proxy MAY add the Privacy header with a priv-value of 
          "history" associated with the specific hi-targeted-to-uri. 
 
   An example policy would be a proxy that only adds the History-Info 
   header if the Histinfo option tag is in the Supported header.  Other 
   proxies may have a policy that they always add the header, but never 
   forward it outside a particular domain, accomplishing this by adding 
   a Privacy header with a priv-value of "history" to allow the 
   information to be collected for internal retargeting only.  
 
   Each application making use of the History-Info header SHOULD address 
   the impacts of the local policies on the specific application (e.g. 
   what specification of local policy is optimally required for a 
   specific application and any potential limitations imposed by local 
   policy decisions). 
 
   Consistent with basic SIP processing of optional headers, proxies 
   SHOULD maintain History-Info headers, received in messages being 
   forwarded, independent of whether local policy supports History-Info. 
    
   The specific processing by proxies for adding the History-Info 
   headers in Requests and Responses is described in detail in the 
   following sections.  
 
   4.3.3.1 Adding the History-Info header to Requests  
    
   Upon evaluation of the considerations under which the History-Info 
   header is to be included in requests (e.g. no Privacy header 
   overriding inclusion, local policy supports, etc.), detailed in 
   section 4.3.3, a proxy SHOULD add a History-Info header as it 
   forwards a Request. Section 16.6 of [4] defines the steps to be 
   followed as the proxy forwards a Request.  Step 5 prescribes the 
   addition of optional headers.  Although, this would seem the 
   appropriate step for adding the History-info header, the interaction 
   with Step 6 "Postprocess routing information" and the impact of a 
   strict route in the Route header could result in the Request-URI 
   being changed, thus adding the History-info header between steps 8 
   (adding Via header) and 9 (adding Content-Length) is RECOMMENDED. 
   Note, that in the case of loose routing, the Request-URI does not 
   change during the forwarding of a Request, thus the capturing of 
 
 
 Barnes                Expires January 8, 2005              [Page 14] 
                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   History-Info for such a request would result in duplicate Request-
   URIs with different indices. The History-Info header SHOULD be added 
   following any History-Info header received in the request being 
   forwarded.  Additionally, if a request is received that doesn't 
   include a History-Info header, the proxy MAY add an additional 
   History-Info header preceding the one being added for the current 
   request being forwarded.  The index for this entry is RECOMMENDED to 
   start at 1. The following subsections define the details of creating 
   the information associated with and in the History-Info header.  
    
   4.3.3.1.1 Privacy in the History-Info header 
    
   If the proxy's local policies, per consideration 4 in section 4.3.3, 
   indicate that this History-Info entry and any entries added due to 
   subsequent retargeting should not be forwarded beyond the domain for 
   which this intermediary is responsible, then a Privacy header with a 
   priv-value of "history" SHOULD be added to the request, if there is 
   not already one, provided the request is being forwarded to a 
   specific URI associated with the domain(s) for which this entity is 
   responsible.   
    
   If a request is being forwarded to a Request URI associated with a 
   domain for which the proxy is not responsible, the proxy needs to 
   determine if there are any entries to be removed prior to forwarding.  
   Any headers associated with the domain(s) for which this proxy is 
   responsible SHOULD be removed prior to forwarding.  
    
   If through local policy, there is knowledge of privacy associated 
   with a specific URI being captured as the hi-targeted-to-uri, a 
   Privacy header with a priv-value of "history" SHOULD be associated 
   with this specific URI as the request is forwarded, if it is being 
   forwarded to a Request URI associated with a domain for which the 
   processing entity is responsible.   
    
   If a request is being forwarded to a Request URI, for which the 
   processing entity is not responsible, the proxy needs to determine if 
   there are any entries, that need to be removed prior to forwarding.  
   The proxy needs to determine if any of the specific URIs that have 
   been captured in the History-Info entries, associated with the 
   domain(s) for which it is responsible, have a priv-value of 
   "history".  Each of these header entries SHOULD be removed from the 
   Request prior to forwarding.     
 
   4.3.3.1.2 Reason in the History-Info header 
 
   For retargets that are the result of an explicit SIP response, the 
   SIP Response Code that triggered the retargeting MUST be included in 
   the Reason header field of the Request URI that has been retargeted.  
   This should occur prior to the forwarding of the request, as it 
 
 
 Barnes                Expires January 8, 2005              [Page 15] 
                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   associated with the previous hi-targeted-to-uri, since it reflects 
   the reason why the Request to that specific URI was not successful. 
    
   For retargets as a result of timeouts or internal events, a Reason 
   MAY be included in the Reason header field of the Request URI that 
   has been retargeted. 
    
   4.3.3.1.3 Indexing in the History-Info header 
    
   In order to maintain ordering and accurately reflect the nesting and 
   retargeting of the request, an index MUST be included along with the 
   Targeted-to-URI being captured. Per the ABNF in section 4.1, the 
   index consists of a dot delimited series of digits (e.g. 1.1.2), with 
   each dot reflecting the number of hops or level of nesting of the 
   request. Within each level, the number reflects the number of peer 
   entities to which the request has been routed.  Thus, the indexing 
   results in a logical tree representation for the history of the 
   Request. It is recommended that for each level of indexing, the index 
   start at 1.  It is recommended that an increment of 1 is used for 
   advancing to a new branch.  For retargets within a proxy, the proxy 
   MUST maintain the current level of nesting by incrementing by 1 the 
   lowest/last digit of the index for each instance of retargeting, thus 
   reflecting the number of retargets (branches) within the proxy.  
    
   The basic rules for adding the index are summarized as follows: 
    
     1. Basic Forwarding:  In the case of a Request that is being 
     forwarded, the index is determined by adding another level of 
     indexing since the depth/length of the branch is increasing. To 
     accomplish this, the proxy reads the value from the History-Info 
     header in the received request, if available, and adds another 
     level of indexing by appending the DOT delimiter followed by an 
     initial index for the new level RECOMMENDED to be  1.  For example, 
     if the index in the last History-Info header field in the received 
     request is 1.1, this proxy would initialize its index to 1.1.1 and 
     forward the request.  
        
     2. Retargeting within a Proxy - 1st instance:  For the first 
     instance of retargeting within a Proxy, the calculation of the 
     index follows that prescribed for basic forwarding.  
      
     3. Retargeting within a Proxy - subsequent instance: For each 
     subsequent retargeting of a request by the same proxy, another 
     branch is added.  With the index for each new branch calculated by 
     incrementing the last/lowest digit at the current level, thus the 
     index in the next request forwarded by this same proxy, following 
     the example above, would be 1.1.2.

                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
     4. Retargeting based upon a Response:  In the case of retargeting 
     due to a specific response (e.g. 302), the index would be 
     calculated per rule 3.  That is, the lowest/last digit of the index 
     is incremented (i.e. a new branch is created), with the increment 
     RECOMMENDED to be 1.  For example, if the index in the History-Info 
     header of the received request was 1.2, then the index in the 
     History-Info header field for the new hi-targeted-to-URI would be 
     1.3.  
      
     5. Retargeting the request in parallel: If the request forwarding 
     is done in parallel, the index MUST be captured for each forked 
     request per the rules above, with each new Request having a unique 
     index. The only difference in the messaging for this scenario and 
     the messaging produced per basic proxy retargeting in rules 2 and 3 
     is these forwarded requests do not have History-Info entries 
     associated with their peers.  The proxy builds the subsequent 
     response (or request) using the amalgamated information associated 
     with each of those requests and including the header entries in the 
     order indicated by the indexing.  Section 4.5 provides an example 
     of a parallel request scenario, highlighting this indexing 
     mechanism.   
    
   4.3.3.2 Processing History-Info in Responses 
    
   A proxy that receives a Request with the Histinfo option tag in the 
   Supported header, and depending upon a local policy supporting the 
   capture of History-Info, SHOULD return captured History-Info in 
   subsequent, provisional and final responses to the Request.   
    
   It should be noted that local policy considerations, for network and 
   intermediary privacy, MAY restrict the sending of the History-Info 
   headers added by the intermediary in subsequent responses.  Thus, in 
   such cases, the proxy MAY remove from these responses the History-
   Info headers which it inserted in the original forwarded request.    
    
   4.3.4 Redirect Server Behavior 
    
   A redirect server SHOULD NOT add any new History-Info, as that would 
   be done by the entity receiving the 3xx response. However, a redirect 
   server MAY include History-Info in responses by adding any History-
   Info headers received in a request to a subsequent response. 
 
   4.4 Security for History-Info 
 
   As discussed in Section 1, the security requirements are partially 
   met by recommending the use of TLS (a basic SIP requirement per 
   [RFC3261]) for hop by hop security.   In addition, the use of the 
   middle-to-end security solution discussed in [SIPIISEC] allows the 

 
 
 Barnes                Expires January 8, 2005              [Page 17] 
                   SIP Request History Information       July 8, 2004 
 
 
   integrity of the History-Info to be ascertained as it traverses the 
   intermediaries. 
 
 4.5 Example Applications using History-Info 
 
   This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
   response is primarily of use in not retrying routes that have already 
   been tried by another proxy. Note, that this is just an example and 
   that there may be valid reasons why a Proxy would want to retry the 
   routes and thus, this would likely be a local proxy or even user 
   specific policy.   
    
   UA 1 sends a call to "Bob" to proxy 1. Proxy 1 forwards the request 
   to Proxy 2.  Proxy 2 sends the requests in parallel and tries several 
   places (UA2, UA3 and UA4) before sending a response to Proxy 1 that 
   all the places are busy.   Proxy 1, without the History-Info, would 
   try several some of the same places (e.g. UA3) based upon registered 
   contacts for "Bob", before completing at UA5. However, with the 
   History-Info, Proxy 1 determines that UA3 has already received the 
   invite, thus the INVITE goes directly to UA5.  
    
   Section 4.5.1 provides this same scenario using one of the privacy 
   mechanism, with Proxy2 adding the Privacy header indicating that the 
   History-Info header is not to be propagated outside P2's domain. This 
   scenario highlights the potential functionality lost with the use of 
   "history" privacy in the Privacy header for the entire request and 
   the need for careful consideration on the use of privacy for History-
   Info.   
    
   Section 4.5.2 also provides the same scenario using one of the 
   privacy mechanisms, however, due to local policy at Proxy2, only one 
   of the Request-URIs (UA4) in the History-Info contains a priv-value 
   of "history", thus allowing some optimized functionality in the 
   routing of the request, but still maintaining privacy for specific 
   URIs.   
    
   Additional detailed scenarios are available in the appendix.

 5. Application Considerations  
 
   As seen by the example scenarios in the appendix, History-Info 
   provides a very flexible building block that can be used by 
   intermediaries and UAs for a variety of services.  As such, any 
   services making use of History-Info must be designed with the 
   following considerations: 
   1) History-Info is optional, thus a service should define default 
      behavior for requests and responses not containing History-Info 
      headers. 
   2) History-Info may be impacted by privacy considerations.  
      Applications requiring History-Info need to be aware that if 
      Header, Session or History level privacy is requested by a UA (or 
      imposed by an intermediary) that History-Info may not be 
      available in a request or response.  This would be addressed by 
      an application in the same manner as the previous consideration 
      by ensuring there is reasonable default behavior should the 
      information not be available.  
   3) History-Info may be impacted by local policy. Each application 
      making use of the History-Info header SHOULD address the impacts 
      of the local policies on the specific application (e.g. what 
      specification of local policy is optimally required for a

      specific application and any potential limitations imposed by 
      local policy decisions). Note, that this is related to the 
      optionality and privacy considerations identified in 1 and 2 
      above, but goes beyond that. For example, due to the optionality 
      and privacy considerations, an entity may receive only partial 
      History-Info entries; will this suffice? Note, that this would be 
      a limitation for debugging purposes, but might be perfectly 
      satisfactory for some models whereby only the information from a 
      specific intermediary is required.  
   4) The security associated with the Request History Information is 
      optional. Whether there is security applied to the entries 
      depends upon local policy. The impact of lack of having the 
      information compromised depends upon the nature of the specific 
      application (e.g. is the information something that appears on a 
      display or is it processed by automata which could have negative 
      impacts on the subsequent processing of a request?).   It is 
      suggested that the impact of an intermediary not supporting the 
      security recommendations should be evaluated by the application 
      to ensure that the impacts have been sufficiently addressed by 
      the application.   
    
 6. Security Considerations  
    
   This draft provides a proposal in sections 3.2 and 4.4 for addressing 
   the Security requirements identified in section 2.1 by mandating the 
   use of TLS between entities.  With TLS, History-Info headers are no 
   less, nor no more, secure than other SIP headers, which generally 
   have even more impact on the subsequent processing of SIP sessions 
   than the History-Info header.  A more robust security solution, which 
   would secure headers added by proxies, SHOULD be used for History-
   Info implementations once there is a solution to the requirements 
   identified in [SIPIISEC].   
     
 7. IANA Considerations 
 
   (Note to RFC Editor: Please fill in all occurrences of XXXX in this 
   section with the RFC number of this specification). 
    
   7.1 Registration of new SIP History-Info header 
 
   This document defines a new SIP header field name: History-Info and a 
   new option tag: Histinfo.  
    
   The following changes should be made to 
   http:///www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters 
    
   The following row should be added to the header field section:  
    
   Header Name             Compact Form               Reference

   The following should be added to the Options Tags section:

   Histinfo      When used with the Supported header, [RFCXXXX] 
                 this option tag indicates support 
                 for the History Information to be  
                 captured for requests and returned in 
                 subsequent responses. This tag is not 
                 used in a Proxy-Require or Require  
                 header field since support of  
                 History-Info is optional.       
 
           
   7.2 Registration of "history" for SIP Privacy header 
 
   This document defines a new priv-value for the SIP Privacy header: 
   history   
    
   The following changes should be made to 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-priv-values 
    
    
   The following should be added to the registration for the SIP

 Changes since last version 
 
   Changes from the 02 to the 03 version: 
      o Editorial changes: Updating to the new template to reflect new 
        IPR guidelines, ensuring that the normative text is complete 
        and accurate in section 4.1, removing "Editor's Notes", etc. 
      o Section 4.5: Fixed error in cause (408 -> 480). 
      o Examples: changed the domain to "example.com", IP addresses to 
        the 192.0.2.0/24 range, changed  occurrences of "Reason:" to 
        "Reason=", added use of Privacy header to examples.  
      o Added text to reflect WG consensus on Issue-1: Privacy 
        indication for History-Info entries.  Proposed an extension to 
        the priv-values defined in RFC 3323 in abstract and section 
        3.3, impacting the protocol structure in section 4.1 and

        processing in 4.3.3 (and 4.3.3.1 and 4.3.3.2).  In addition, 
        the new priv-value needs to be registered with IANA, per 
        section 7.   
      o Removed Open Issues section. For Issue-2, there was not WG 
        consensus to define an algorithm for bounding the number of 
        History-Info entries, but rather that is left as an 
        implementation decision.  
      o Updated Security discussions to reflect WG consensus that TLS 
        is mandatory and sufficient for general History-Info 
        implementation. The e2m and m2m security solutions can be 
        applied to History-Info when they become available to provide a 
        more robust SIP solution.  
      o Section 4.1: Added additional text to ensure that all the 
        information in the History-Info header is appropriately and 
        normatively described (in text). 
      o Added text in section 4.3.1 and an example to the appendices to 
        address the UAC having added multiple History-Info headers for 
        the case where the 3xx response goes back to the UAC and it's 
        the UAC that retargets the INVITE request.    
      o Clarified the addition of the Reason header in section 
        4.3.3.1.2. 
      o Further delineated the basic rules in section 4.3.3.1.3 for 
        calculating the index for various scenarios, as this was still 
        causing some confusion.  
       
   Changes from the 01 to the 02 version: 
    
      o Merged the SIPPING WG requirements draft into this document. 
        Note that this increments the section references in the 
        remainder of the document by 2 (and by 3 for Security and IANA 
        considerations due to new section added). Also, removed 
        redirect server from ISSUER-req since the solution identified 
        this as not being required (or desirable).  
      o Added an explicit privacy requirement (PRIV-req-3) for the 
        proxy's role in recognizing and maintaining privacy associated 
        with a Request-URI being captured in History-Info due to local 
        policy. (Note, that the text was already there, it just wasn't 
        highlighted as an explicit requirement).  
      o Clarified the use of CRLF and spacing in the example headers in 
        section 4.2. 
      o Removed the compact form for the header since unknown headers 
        with multiple entries would not be recognized (i.e. this may 
        cause parsing problems). 
      o Added a summary of Application Considerations to address 
        concerns about the optional usage of History-Info.  
      o Converted the references from numbers to labels to avoid the 
        continual problem of renumbering. 
      o Minor editorial changes (per NITS highlighted by Rohan and Eric 
        and some minor rewording for clarity).

   Changes from the 00 to the 01 version: 
    
     o Attempted to be more explicit about the fundamental processing 
        associated with the header.  Removed definitions of new terms, 
        only referencing the terms from the requirements in the context 
        of the fundamental SIP processing implied by the terms.   
     o Attempted to clarify the Index and the related processing.  
     o Added more detail addressing the privacy requirements. 
     o Added a bit more detail on security. The security solution 
        remains in a separate document and this document will need 
        updating once that is completed.  
     o Updated the examples (in section 2.5 and appendix) and clarified 
        the definition and the maintenance of the Index in sections 2.1 
        and 2.3.3.1.   
     o Clarified the Reason description in section 2.1.  There had been 
        an error in the description of the processing that was a remnant 
        of the change to include only a single URI for each History-Info 
        header. 
     o Miscellaneous editorial changes (i.e. HistInfo -> Histinfo, 
        etc.) 
 
   Changes from individual draft-barnes-sipping-history-info-02 to the 
   00 WG version:       
      o Updated references and added reference to Security solution 
        draft. 
      o Removed appendix D which included background on analysis of 
        solution options. 
      o Cleaned up the document format per rfc2223bis. 
      o Strengthened the inclusion of the INDEX as a MUST (per 
        discussion at IETF-56). 
      o Added text around the capturing of the Reason (SHOULD be 
        captured for SIP responses and MAY be captured for other things 
        such as timeouts).   
      o Clarified the response processing 2.3.3.2 to include 
        provisional responses and the sending of a 183 to convey 
        History-Info. 
      o Added section 2.3.4 to address Redirect Server behavior.

 Appendix A  Forking Scenarios 
    
 A.1 Sequentially forking (History-Info in Response) 
    
   This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
   response is useful to an application or user that originated the 
   request.

   UA 1 sends a call to "Bob" via proxy 1. Proxy 1 sequentially tries 
   several places (UA2, UA3 and UA4) unsuccessfully before sending a 
   response to UA1.   
 
   This scenario is provided to show that by providing the History-Info 
   to UA1, the end user or an application at UA1 could make a decision 
   on how best to attempt finding "Bob".  Without this mechanism UA1 
   might well attempt UA3 (and thus UA4) and then re-attempt UA4 on a 
   third manual attempt at reaching "Bob". With this mechanism, either 
   the end user or application could know that "Bob" is busy on his home 
   phone and is physically not in the office. If there were an 
   alternative address for "Bob" known to this end user or application, 
   that hasn't been attempted, then either the application or the end 
   user could attempt that. The intent here is to highlight an example 
   of the flexibility of this mechanism that enables applications well 
   beyond SIP as it is certainly well beyond the scope of this draft to 
   prescribe detailed applications.

 A.2 Sequential Forking (with Success) 
 
   This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
   request is primarily of use in not retrying routes that have already 
   been tried by another proxy. Note, that this is just an example and 
   that there may be valid reasons why a Proxy would want to retry the 
   routes and thus, this would like be a local proxy or even user 
   specific policy.  
    
   UA 1 sends a call to "Bob" to proxy 1. Proxy 1 sequentially tries 
   several places (UA2, UA3 and UA4) before retargeting the call to 
   Proxy 2.  Proxy 2, without the History-Info, would try several of the 
   same places (UA3 and UA4)based upon registered contacts for "Bob", 
   before completing at UA5. However, with the History-Info, Proxy 2 
   determines that UA3 and UA4 have already received the invite, thus 
   the INVITE goes directly to UA5.

 Appendix B  Voicemail 
 
   This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
   request is primarily of use by an edge service (e.g. Voicemail 
   Server). It should be noted that this isn't intended to be a complete 
   specification for this specific edge service as it is quite likely 
   that additional information is need by the edge service. History-Info 
   is just one building block that this service makes use of. 
 
   UA 1 called UA A which had been forwarded to UA B which forwarded to 
   a UA VM (voicemail server).  Based upon the retargeted URIs and 
   Reasons (and other information) in the INVITE, the VM server makes a 
   policy decision about what mailbox to use, which greeting to play 
   etc.

 Appendix C  Automatic Call Distribution Example 
 
   This scenario highlights an example of an Automatic Call Distribution 
   service, where the agents are divided into groups based upon the type 
   of customers they handle. In this example, the Gold customers are 
   given higher priority than Silver customers, so a Gold call would get 
   serviced even if all the agents servicing the Gold group (ACDGRP1) 
   were busy, by retargeting the request to the Silver Group.  Upon 
   receipt of the call at the agent assigned to handle the incoming 
   call, based upon the History-Info header in the message, the 
   application at the agent can provide an indication that this is a 
   Gold call, from how many groups it might have overflowed before 
   reaching the agent, etc. and thus can be handled appropriately by the 
   agent.  
    
   For scenarios whereby calls might overflow from the Silver to the 
   Gold, clearly the alternate group identification, internal routing or 
   actual agent that handles the call SHOULD not be sent to UA1, thus 
   for this scenario, one would expect that the Proxy would not support 
   the sending of the History-Info in the response, even if requested by 
   the calling UA.  
    
   As with the other examples, this is not prescriptive of how one would 
   do this type of service but an example of a subset of processing that 
   might be associated with such a service.  In addition, this example 
   is not addressing any aspects of Agent availability, which might also 
   be done via a SIP interface.

 Appendix D Session via Redirect and Proxy Servers  
    
   In this scenario, Alice places a call to Bob using first a Redirect    
   server then a Proxy Server.  The INVITE message is first sent to the 
   Redirect Server.  The Server returns a 302 Moved Temporarily response 
   (F2) containing a Contact header with Bob's current SIP address.  
   Alice then generates a new INVITE with Bob's current SIP address 
   included in another History-Info entry.  The INVITE is then sent to 
   Bob via the Proxy Server, with Bob receiving the complete History 
   information; the call then proceeds normally.  The complete call flow 
   for this scenario, without the use of History-Info is described in 
   the SIP Basic Call Flow Examples [RFC3665].
