Internet-Draft           IMAP4 Keyword Registry                July 2009


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Kwds].


2.  Introduction

   IMAP Keywords [RFC3501] are boolean named flags that can be used by
   clients to annotate messages in an IMAP mailbox.  Although support
   for IMAP keywords is an optional feature of IMAP, the majority of
   IMAP servers allow for storing of arbitrary keywords.  Many
   mainstream IMAP clients support some specific keywords, and some can
   manage arbitrary IMAP keywords.

   Over years some IMAP keywords have become de-facto standard, with
   some specific semantics associated with them.  In some cases
   different client implementors decided to define and use keywords with
   different names, but the same semantics.  Some server implementors
   decided to map such keywords automatically in order to improve cross
   client interoperability.

   In other cases, the same keywords have been used with different
   semantics, thus causing interoperability problems.

   This document attempts to prevent further incompatible uses of IMAP
   keywords by establishing an IMAP Keyword registry, and documenting a
   reserved space for standardized keywords.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish a new registry for IMAP keywords.

   Registration of an IMAP keyword is requested by filling in the
   following template:

   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword X


   IMAP keyword name:


   Purpose (description):

Internet-Draft           IMAP4 Keyword Registry                July 2009


   Private or Shared on a server:  (One of PRIVATE, SHARED or BOTH.
               PRIVATE means that each different user has own copy of
               the keyword.  SHARED means that all different users see
               the same value of the keyword.  BOTH means that an IMAP
               server can have the keyword as either private or shared.)


   Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:


   When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:


   Related keywords:  (for example "mutually exclusive with keywords Y
               and Z")


   Related IMAP capabilities:


   Security considerations:


   Published specification (recommended):


   Person & email address to contact for further information:


   Intended usage:  (One of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)


   Owner/Change controller:


   Note:       (Any other information that the author deems interesting
               may be added here, for example if the keyword(s) is
               supported by existing clients.)


   and sending it via electronic mail to <iana@iana.org>.

   Registration of an IMAP keyword intended for common use requires
   Expert Review.  This can be performed by posting a review request to
   the Message Organization WG mailing list <morg@ietf.org> (or its
   replacement as chosen by the responsible Application Area Director).

   Keywords intended for widespread use SHOULD start with the "$"

   prefix.  IMAP keywords intended for widespread use SHOULD be
   standardized in IETF Consensus documents.

   Registration of vendor specific keywords is done on First Come First
   Serve basis and doesn't require the Expert Review.  However such
   review is still encouraged.  Vendor specific keywords MUST start with
   the "vnd." prefix. [[anchor3: SHOULD this be followed by the company
   name?]]

3.1.  Comments on IMAP Keywords' Registrations

   Comments on registered IMAP Keywords should first be sent to the
   "owner" of the mechanism and then to the mailing list designated to
   IMAP keyword review Section 3

   Submitters of comments may, after a reasonable attempt to contact the
   owner and after soliciting comments on the IMAP mailing list, request
   IANA to attach their comment to the IMAP keyword registration itself
   by sending mail to <iana@iana.org>.  At IANA sole discretion, IANA
   may attach the comment to the IMAP keyword registration.

3.2.  Change Control

   Once an IMAP keyword registration has been published by IANA, the
   author may request a change to its definition.  The change request
   follows the same procedure as the registration request, with the
   exception of changes to the "Person & email address to contact for
   further information" and "Owner/Change controller" fields.  The
   latter can be changed by the owner by sending informing IANA; this
   can be done without discussion or review.

   The IESG may reassign responsibility for an IMAP keyword.  The most
   common case of this will be to enable changes to be made to
   mechanisms where the author of the registration has died, moved out
   of contact or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important
   to the community.

   IMAP keyword registrations may not be deleted; keywords which are no
   longer believed appropriate for use can be declared OBSOLETE by a
   change to their "intended usage" field.

   The IESG is considered to be the owner of all IMAP keywords which are
   on the IETF standards track.

3.3.  Initial registrations

   IANA is requested to register the following IMAP Keyword in the
   registry established in this document:

Internet-Draft           IMAP4 Keyword Registry                July 2009


   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword $MDNSent


   IMAP keyword name:  $MDNSent


   Purpose (description):  Specifies that a Message Disposition
               Notification (MDN) must not be sent for any message
               annotated with the $MDNSent IMAP keyword.


   Private or Shared on a server:  SHARED


   Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:  This
               keyword can cause automatic action by the client.  See
               [RFC3503] for more details


   When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:  This keyword is set by an
               IMAP client when it decides to act on a MDN request, or
               when uploading a sent or draft message.


   Related keywords:  None


   Related IMAP capabilities:  None


   Security considerations:  See section 6 of [RFC3503]


   Published specification (recommended):  [RFC3503]


   Person & email address to contact for further information:  Alexey
               Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>


   Intended usage:  COMMON


   Owner/Change controller:  IESG

   Note:



4.  Security Considerations

   IMAP Keywords are one of the base IMAP features [RFC3501].  This
   document doesn't change their behaviour, so it is not adding new
   security issues.

   A particular IMAP keyword might have specific security
   considerations, which are documented in IMAP keyword registration
   template standardized by this document.


5.  Acknowledgements
