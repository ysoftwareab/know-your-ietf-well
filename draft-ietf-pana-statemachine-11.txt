Abstract

   This document defines the conceptual state machines for the Protocol
   for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA).  The state
   machines consist of the PANA Client (PaC) state machine and the PANA
   Authentication Agent (PAA) state machine.  The two state machines
   show how PANA can interface with the EAP state machines.  The state
   machines and associated model are informative only.  Implementations
   may achieve the same results using different methods.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the state machines for Protocol Carrying
   Authentication for Network Access (PANA) [RFC5191].  There are state
   machines for the PANA client (PaC) and for the PANA Authentication
   Agent (PAA).  Each state machine is specified through a set of
   variables, procedures and a state transition table.  The state
   machines and associated models described in this document are
   informative only.  Implementations may achieve similar results using
   different models and/or methods.

   A PANA protocol execution consists of several exchanges to carry
   authentication information.  Specifically, EAP PDUs are transported
   inside PANA PDUs between PaC and PAA, that is PANA represents a lower
   layer for EAP protocol.  Thus, a PANA state machine bases its
   execution on an EAP state machine execution and vice versa.  Thus
   this document also shows for each of PaC and PAA an interface between
   an EAP state machine and a PANA state machine and how this interface
   allows to exchange information between them.  Thanks to this
   interface, a PANA state machine can be informed about several events
   generated in an EAP state machine and make its execution conditional
   to its events.

   The details of EAP state machines are out of the scope of this
   document.  Additional information can be found in [RFC4137].
   Nevertheless PANA state machines presented here have been coordinated
   with state machines shown by [RFC4137].

   This document, apart from defining PaC and PAA state machines and
   their interfaces to EAP state machines (running on top of PANA),
   provides some implementation considerations, taking into account that
   it is not a specification but an implementation guideline.

3.  Interface Between PANA and EAP

   PANA carries EAP messages exchanged between an EAP peer and an EAP
   authenticator (see Figure 1).  Thus a PANA state machine interacts
   with an EAP state machine.

   Two state machines are defined in this document : the PaC state
   machine (see Section 7) and the PAA state machine (see Section 8).
   The definition of each state machine consists of a set of variables,
   procedures and a state transition table.  A subset of these variables
   and procedures defines the interface between a PANA state machine and
   an EAP state machine and the state transition table defines the PANA
   state machine behavior based on results obtained through them.

   On the one hand, the PaC state machine interacts with an EAP peer
   state machine in order to carry out the PANA protocol on the PaC
   side.  On the other hand, the PAA state machine interacts with an EAP
   authenticator state machine to run the PANA protocol on the PAA side.

                     Peer             |EAP            Auth
                     EAP    <---------|------------>  EAP
                    ^ |               |              ^ |
                    | |               | EAP-Message  | |  EAP-Message
       EAP-Message    | |EAP-Message  |                | |
                      | v             |PANA            | v
                     PaC    <---------|------------>  PAA

                 Figure 1: Interface between PANA and EAP

   Thus two interfaces are needed between PANA state machines and EAP
   state machines, namely:

   o  Interface between the PaC state machine and the EAP peer state
      machine

   o  Interface between the PAA state machine and the EAP authenticator
      state machine

   In general, the PaC and PAA state machines present EAP messages to
   the EAP peer and authenticator state machines through the interface,
   respectively.  The EAP peer and authenticator state machines process
   these messages and sends EAP messages through the PaC and PAA state
   machines that is responsible for actually transmitting this message,
   respectively.

   For example, [RFC4137] specifies four interfaces to lower layers: (i)
   an interface between the EAP peer state machine and a lower layer,
   (ii) an interface between the EAP standalone authenticator state

   machine and a lower layer, (iii) an interface between the EAP full
   authenticator state machine and a lower layer and (iv) an interface
   between the EAP backend authenticator state machine and a lower
   layer.  In this document, the PANA protocol is the lower layer of EAP
   and only the first three interfaces are of interest to PANA.  The
   second and third interfaces are the same.  In this regard, the EAP
   standalone authenticator or the EAP full authenticator and its state
   machine in [RFC4137] are referred to as the EAP authenticator and the
   EAP authenticator state machine, respectively, in this document.  If
   an EAP peer and an EAP authenticator follow the state machines
   defined in [RFC4137], the interfaces between PANA and EAP could be
   based on that document.  Detailed definition of interfaces between
   PANA and EAP are described in the subsequent sections.

4.  Document Authority

   This document is intended to comply with the technical contents of
   any of the related documents ([RFC5191] and [RFC4137]).  When there
   is a discrepancy, the related documents are considered authoritative
   and they take precedence over this document.

5.  Notations

   The following state transition tables are completed mostly based on
   the conventions specified in [RFC4137].  The complete text is
   described below.

   State transition tables are used to represent the operation of the
   protocol by a number of cooperating state machines each comprising a
   group of connected, mutually exclusive states.  Only one state of
   each machine can be active at any given time.

   All permissible transitions from a given state to other states and
   associated actions performed when the transitions occur are
   represented by using triplets of (exit condition, exit action, exit
   state).  All conditions are expressions that evaluate to TRUE or
   FALSE; if a condition evaluates to TRUE, then the condition is met.
   A state "ANY" is a wildcard state that matches any state in each
   state machine except those explicity enumerated as exception states.
   The exit conditions of a wildcard state are evaluated after all other
   exit conditions of specific to the current state are met.

   On exit from a state, the exit actions defined for the state and the
   exit condition are executed exactly once, in the order that they
   appear.  (Note that the procedures defined in [RFC4137] are executed
   on entry to a state, which is one major difference from this
   document.)  Each exit action is deemed to be atomic; i.e., execution
   of an exit action completes before the next sequential exit action
   starts to execute.  No exit action execute outside of a state block.
   The exit actions in only one state block execute at a time even if
   the conditions for execution of state blocks in different state
   machines are satisfied.  All exit actions in an executing state block
   complete execution before the transition to and execution of any
   other state blocks.  The execution of any state block appears to be
   atomic with respect to the execution of any other state block and the
   transition condition to that state from the previous state is TRUE
   when execution commences.  The order of execution of state blocks in
   different state machines is undefined except as constrained by their
   transition conditions.  A variable that is set to a particular value
   in a state block retains this value until a subsequent state block
   executes an exit action that modifies the value.

   On completion of the transition from the previous state to the
   current state, all exit conditions occurring during the current state
   (including exit conditions defined for the wildcard state) are
   evaluated until an exit condition for that state is met.

   Any event variable is set to TRUE when the corresponding event occurs
   and set to FALSE immediately after completion of the action

   associated with the current state and the event.

   The interpretation of the special symbols and operators used is
   defined in [RFC4137].

6.  Common Rules

   There are following procedures, variables, message initializing rules
   and state transitions that are common to both the PaC and PAA state
   machines.

   Throughout this document, the character string "PANA_MESSAGE_NAME"
   matches any one of the abbreviated PANA message names, i.e., "PCI",
   "PAR", "PAN", "PTR", "PTA", "PNR", "PNA".

6.1.  Common Procedures

   void None()

      A null procedure, i.e., nothing is done.

   void Disconnect()

      A procedure to delete the PANA session as well as the
      corresponding EAP session and authorization state.

   boolean Authorize()

      A procedure to create or modify authorization state.  It returns
      TRUE if authorization is successful.  Otherwise, it returns FALSE.
      It is assumed that Authorize() procedure of PaC state machine
      always returns TRUE.  In the case that a non-key-generating EAP
      method is used but a PANA SA is required after successful
      authentication (generate_pana_sa() returns TRUE), Authorize()
      procedure must return FALSE.

   void Tx:PANA_MESSAGE_NAME[flag](AVPs)

      A procedure to send a PANA message to its peering PANA entity.
      The "flag" argument contains one or more flag (e.g., Tx:PAR[C]) to
      be set to the message, except for 'R' (Request) flag.  The "AVPs"
      contains a list of names of optional AVPs to be inserted in the
      message, except for AUTH AVP.

      This procedure includes the following action before actual
      transmission:

             if (flag==S)
               PANA_MESSAGE_NAME.S_flag=Set;
             if (flag==C)
               PANA_MESSAGE_NAME.C_flag=Set;
             if (flag==A)
               PANA_MESSAGE_NAME.A_flag=Set;
             if (flag==P)
               PANA_MESSAGE_NAME.P_flag=Set;
             PANA_MESSAGE_NAME.insert_avp(AVPs);
             if (key_available())
               PANA_MESSAGE_NANE.insert_avp("AUTH");

   void TxEAP()

      A procedure to send an EAP message to the EAP state machine it
      interfaces to.

   void RtxTimerStart()

      A procedure to start the retransmission timer, reset RTX_COUNTER
      variable to zero and set an appropriate value to RTX_MAX_NUM
      variable.  Note that RTX_MAX_NUM is assumed to be set to the same
      default value for all messages.  However, implementations may also
      reset RTX_MAX_NUM in this procedure and its value may vary
      depending on the message that was sent.

   void RtxTimerStop()

      A procedure to stop the retransmission timer.

   void SessionTimerReStart(TIMEOUT)

      A procedure to (re)start PANA session timer.  TIMEOUT specifies
      the expiration time associated of the session timer.  Expiration
      of TIMEOUT will trigger a SESS_TIMEOUT event.

   void SessionTimerStop()

      A procedure to stop the current PANA session timer.

   void Retransmit()

      A procedure to retransmit a PANA message and increment RTX_COUNTER
      by one(1).

Internet-Draft             PANA State Machines                April 2009


   void EAP_Restart()

      A procedure to (re)start an EAP conversation resulting in the re-
      initialization of an existing EAP session.

   void PANA_MESSAGE_NAME.insert_avp("AVP_NAME1", "AVP_NAME2",...)

      A procedure to insert AVPs for each specified AVP name in the list
      of AVP names in the PANA message.  When an AVP name ends with "*",
      zero, one or more AVPs are inserted, otherwise one AVP is
      inserted.

   boolean PANA_MESSAGE_NAME.exist_avp("AVP_NAME")

      A procedure that checks whether an AVP of the specified AVP name
      exists in the specified PANA message and returns TRUE if the
      specified AVP is found, otherwise returns FALSE.

   boolean generate_pana_sa()

      A procedure to check whether the EAP method being used generates
      keys and that a PANA SA will be established on successful
      authentication.  For the PaC, the procedure is also used to check
      and match the PRF and Integrity algorithm AVPs advertised by the
      PAA in PAR[S] message.  For the PAA, it is used to indicate
      whether a PRF and Integrity algorithm AVPs will be sent in the
      PAR[S].  This procedure will return true if a PANA SA will be
      generated.  Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

   boolean key_available()

      A procedure to check whether the PANA session has a PANA_AUTH_KEY.
      If the state machine already has a PANA_AUTH_KEY, it returns TRUE.
      If the state machine does not have a PANA_AUTH_KEY, it tries to
      retrieve an MSK from the EAP entity.  If an MSK is retrieved, it
      computes a PANA_AUTH_KEY from the MSK and returns TRUE.
      Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

6.2.  Common Variables

   PAR.RESULT_CODE

      This variable contains the Result-Code AVP value in the PANA-Auth-
      Request message in process.  When this variable carries
      PANA_SUCCESS it is assumed that the PAR message always contains an
      EAP-Payload AVP which carries an EAP-Success message.

Internet-Draft             PANA State Machines                April 2009


   NONCE_SENT

      This variable is set to TRUE to indicate that a Nonce-AVP has
      already been sent.  Otherwise it is set to FALSE.

   RTX_COUNTER

      This variable contains the current number of retransmissions of
      the outstanding PANA message.

   Rx:PANA_MESSAGE_NAME[flag]

      This event variable is set to TRUE when the specified PANA message
      is received from its peering PANA entity.  The "flag" contains a
      flag (e.g., Rx:PAR[C]), except for 'R' (Request) flag.

   RTX_TIMEOUT

      This event variable is set to TRUE when the retransmission timer
      is expired.

   REAUTH

      This event variable is set to TRUE when an initiation of re-
      authentication phase is triggered.  This event variable can only
      be set while in the OPEN state.

   TERMINATE

      This event variable is set to TRUE when initiation of PANA session
      termination is triggered.  This event variable can only be set
      while in the OPEN state.

   PANA_PING

      This event variable is set to TRUE when initiation of liveness
      test based on PANA-Notification exchange is triggered.  This event
      variable can only be set while in the OPEN state.

   SESS_TIMEOUT

      This event is variable is set to TRUE when the session timer has
      expired.

   LIFETIME_SESS_TIMEOUT

      Configurable value used by the PaC and PAA to close or disconnect
      an established session in the access phase.  This variable

      indicates the expiration of the session and is set to the value of
      Session-Lifetime AVP if present in the last PANA-Auth-Request
      message in the case of the PaC.  Otherwise, it is assumed that the
      value is infinite and therefore has no expiration.  Expiration of
      LIFETIME_SESS_TIMEOUT will cause the event variable SESS_TIMEOUT
      to be set.

   ANY

      This event variable is set to TRUE when any event occurs.

6.3.  Configurable Values

   RTX_MAX_NUM

      Configurable maximum for how many retransmissions should be
      attempted before aborting.

6.4.  Common Message Initialization Rules

   When a message is prepared for sending, it is initialized as follows:

   o  For a request message, R-flag of the header is set.  Otherwise,
      R-flag is not set.

   o  Other message header flags are not set.  They are set explicitly
      by specific state machine actions.

   o  AVPs that are mandatory included in a message are inserted with
      appropriate values set.

6.5.  Common Retransmition Rules

   The state machines defined in this document assumes that the PaC and
   the PAA caches the last transmitted answer message.  This scheme is
   described in Sec 5.2 of [RFC5191].  When the PaC or PAA receives a
   re-transmitted or duplicate request, it would be able to re-send the
   corresponding answer without any aid from the EAP layer.  However, to
   simplify the state machine description, this caching scheme is
   omitted in the state machines below.  In the case that there is not
   corresponding answer to a re-transmitted request, the request will be
   handled by the corresponding statemachine.

6.6.  Common State Transitions

   The following transitions can occur at any state with exemptions
   explicitly noted.

7.  PaC State Machine

7.1.  Interface between PaC and EAP Peer

   This interface defines the interactions between a PaC and an EAP
   peer.  The interface serves as a mechanism to deliver EAP messages
   for the EAP peer.  It allows the EAP peer to receive EAP requests and
   send EAP responses via the PaC.  It also provides a mechanism to
   notify the EAP peer of PaC events and a mechanism to receive
   notification of EAP peer events.  The EAP message delivery mechanism
   as well as the event notification mechanism in this interface have
   direct correlation with the PaC state transition table entries.
   These message delivery and event notifications mechanisms occur only
   within the context of their associated states or exit actions.

7.1.1.  Delivering EAP Messages from PaC to EAP Peer

   TxEAP() procedure in the PaC state machine serves as the mechanism to
   deliver EAP messages contained in PANA-Auth-Request messages to the
   EAP peer.  This procedure is enabled only after an EAP restart event
   is notified to the EAP peer and before any event resulting in a
   termination of the EAP peer session.  In the case where the EAP peer
   follows the EAP peer state machine defined in [RFC4137], TxEAP()
   procedure sets eapReq variable of the EAP peer state machine and puts
   the EAP request in eapReqData variable of the EAP peer state machine.

7.1.2.  Delivering EAP Messages from EAP Peer to PaC

   An EAP message is delivered from the EAP peer to the PaC via
   EAP_RESPONSE event variable.  The event variable is set when the EAP
   peer passes the EAP message to its lower-layer.  In the case where
   the EAP peer follows the EAP peer state machine defined in [RFC4137],
   EAP_RESPONSE event variable refers to eapResp variable of the EAP
   peer state machine and the EAP message is contained in eapRespData
   variable of the EAP peer state machine.

7.1.3.  EAP Restart Notification from PaC to EAP Peer

   The EAP peer state machine defined in [RFC4137] has an initialization
   procedure before receiving an EAP message.  To initialize the EAP
   state machine, the PaC state machine defines an event notification
   mechanism to send an EAP (re)start event to the EAP peer.  The event
   notification is done via EAP_Restart() procedure in the
   initialization action of the PaC state machine.

Internet-Draft             PANA State Machines                April 2009


7.1.4.  EAP Authentication Result Notification from EAP Peer to PaC

   In order for the EAP peer to notify the PaC of an EAP authentication
   result, EAP_SUCCESS and EAP_FAILURE event variables are defined.  In
   the case where the EAP peer follows the EAP peer state machine
   defined in [RFC4137], EAP_SUCCESS and EAP_FAILURE event variables
   refer to eapSuccess and eapFail variables of the EAP peer state
   machine, respectively.  In this case, if EAP_SUCCESS event variable
   is set to TRUE and an MSK is generated by the EAP authentication
   method in use, eapKeyAvailable variable is set to TRUE and eapKeyData
   variable contains the MSK.  Note that EAP_SUCCESS and EAP_FAILURE
   event variables may be set to TRUE even before the PaC receives a PAR
   with a 'Complete' flag set from the PAA.

7.1.5.  Alternate Failure Notification from PaC to EAP Peer

   alt_reject() procedure in the PaC state machine serves as the
   mechanism to deliver an authentication failure event to the EAP peer
   without accompanying an EAP message.  In the case where the EAP peer
   follows the EAP peer state machine defined in [RFC4137], alt_reject()
   procedure sets altReject variable of the EAP peer state machine.
   Note that the EAP peer state machine in [RFC4137] also defines
   altAccept variable, however, it is never used in PANA in which EAP-
   Success messages are reliably delivered by the last PANA-Auth
   exchange.

7.2.  Configurable Values

   FAILED_SESS_TIMEOUT

      Configurable value that allows the PaC to determine whether a PaC
      authentication and authorization phase has stalled without an
      explicit EAP success or failure notification.

7.3.  Variables

   AUTH_USER

      This event variable is set to TRUE when initiation of EAP-based
      (re-)authentication is triggered by the application.

   EAP_SUCCESS

      This event variable is set to TRUE when the EAP peer determines
      that EAP conversation completes with success.

Internet-Draft             PANA State Machines                April 2009


   EAP_FAILURE

      This event variable is set to TRUE when the EAP peer determines
      that EAP conversation completes with failure.

   EAP_RESPONSE

      This event variable is set to TRUE when the EAP peer delivers an
      EAP message to the PaC.  This event accompanies an EAP message
      received from the EAP peer.

   EAP_RESP_TIMEOUT

      This event variable is set to TRUE when the PaC that has passed an
      EAP message to the EAP-layer does not receive a subsequent EAP
      message from the the EAP-layer in a given period.  This provides a
      time limit for certain EAP methods where user interaction maybe
      required.

7.4.  Procedures

   boolean eap_piggyback()

      This procedures returns TRUE to indicate whether the next EAP
      response will be carried in the pending PAN message for
      optimization.

   void alt_reject()

      This procedure informs the EAP peer of an authentication failure
      event without accompanying an EAP message.

   void EAP_RespTimerStart()

      A procedure to start a timer to receive an EAP-Response from the
      EAP peer.

   void EAP_RespTimerStop()

      A procedure to stop a timer to receive an EAP-Response from the
      EAP peer.

8.  PAA State Machine

8.1.  Interface between PAA and EAP Authenticator

   The interface between a PAA and an EAP authenticator provides a
   mechanism to deliver EAP messages for the EAP authenticator as well
   as a mechanism to notify the EAP authenticator of PAA events and to
   receive notification of EAP authenticator events.  These message
   delivery and event notification mechanisms occur only within context
   of their associated states or exit actions.

8.1.1.  EAP Restart Notification from PAA to EAP Authenticator

   An EAP authenticator state machine defined in [RFC4137] has an
   initialization procedure before sending the first EAP request.  To
   initialize the EAP state machine, the PAA state machine defines an
   event notification mechanism to send an EAP (re)start event to the
   EAP authenticator.  The event notification is done via EAP_Restart()
   procedure in the initialization action of the PAA state machine.

8.1.2.  Delivering EAP Responses from PAA to EAP Authenticator

   TxEAP() procedure in the PAA state machine serves as the mechanism to
   deliver EAP-Responses contained in PANA-Auth-Answer messages to the
   EAP authenticator.  This procedure is enabled only after an EAP
   restart event is notified to the EAP authenticator and before any
   event resulting in a termination of the EAP authenticator session.
   In the case where the EAP authenticator follows the EAP authenticator
   state machines defined in [RFC4137], TxEAP() procedure sets eapResp
   variable of the EAP authenticator state machine and puts the EAP
   response in eapRespData variable of the EAP authenticator state
   machine.

8.1.3.  Delivering EAP Messages from EAP Authenticator to PAA

   An EAP request is delivered from the EAP authenticator to the PAA via
   EAP_REQUEST event variable.  The event variable is set when the EAP
   authenticator passes the EAP request to its lower-layer.  In the case
   where the EAP authenticator follows the EAP authenticator state
   machines defined in [RFC4137], EAP_REQUEST event variable refers to
   eapReq variable of the EAP authenticator state machine and the EAP
   request is contained in eapReqData variable of the EAP authenticator
   state machine.

8.1.4.  EAP Authentication Result Notification from EAP Authenticator to
        PAA

   In order for the EAP authenticator to notify the PAA of the EAP

   authentication result, EAP_SUCCESS, EAP_FAILURE and EAP_TIMEOUT event
   variables are defined.  In the case where the EAP authenticator
   follows the EAP authenticator state machines defined in [RFC4137],
   EAP_SUCCESS, EAP_FAILURE and EAP_TIMEOUT event variables refer to
   eapSuccess, eapFail and eapTimeout variables of the EAP authenticator
   state machine, respectively.  In this case, if EAP_SUCCESS event
   variable is set to TRUE, an EAP-Success message is contained in
   eapReqData variable of the EAP authenticator state machine, and
   additionally, eapKeyAvailable variable is set to TRUE and eapKeyData
   variable contains an MSK if the MSK is generated as a result of
   successful authentication by the EAP authentication method in use.
   Similarly, if EAP_FAILURE event variable is set to TRUE, an EAP-
   Failure message is contained in eapReqData variable of the EAP
   authenticator state machine.  The PAA uses EAP_SUCCESS, EAP_FAILURE
   and EAP_TIMEOUT event variables as a trigger to send a PAR message to
   the PaC.

8.2.  Variables

   OPTIMIZED_INIT

      This variable indicates whether the PAA is able to piggyback an
      EAP-Request in the initial PANA-Auth-Request.  Otherwise it is set
      to FALSE.

   PAC_FOUND

      This variable is set to TRUE as a result of a PAA initiated
      handshake.

   REAUTH_TIMEOUT

      This event variable is set to TRUE to indicate that the PAA
      initiates a re-authentication with the PaC.  The re-authentication
      timeout should be set to a value less than the session timeout
      carried in the Session-Lifetime AVP if present.

   EAP_SUCCESS

      This event variable is set to TRUE when EAP conversation completes
      with success.  This event accompanies an EAP- Success message
      passed from the EAP authenticator.

   EAP_FAILURE

      This event variable is set to TRUE when EAP conversation completes
      with failure.  This event accompanies an EAP- Failure message
      passed from the EAP authenticator.

   EAP_REQUEST

      This event variable is set to TRUE when the EAP authenticator
      delivers an EAP Request to the PAA.  This event accompanies an
      EAP-Request message received from the EAP authenticator.

   EAP_TIMEOUT

      This event variable is set to TRUE when EAP conversation times out
      without generating an EAP-Success or an EAP-Failure message.  This
      event does not accompany any EAP message.

8.3.  Procedures

   boolean new_key_available()

      A procedure to check whether the PANA session has a new
      PANA_AUTH_KEY.  If the state machine already have a PANA_AUTH_KEY,
      it returns FALSE.  If the state machine does not have a
      PANA_AUTH_KEY, it tries to retrieve an MSK from the EAP entity.
      If an MSK has been retrieved, it computes a PANA_AUTH_KEY from the
      MSK and returns TRUE.  Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

9.  Implementation Considerations

9.1.  PAA and PaC Interface to Service Management Entity

   In general, it is assumed each device or network equipment has a PANA
   protocol stack available for use by other modules within the device
   or network equipment.  One such module is the Service Management
   Entity (SME).  The SME is a generic term for modules that manages
   different services (including network protocols) that installed on a
   device or equipment.  To integrate PANA protocol with the SME, it is
   recommended that a generic interface (i.e., the SME-PANA interface)
   between the SME and the PANA protocol stack be provided by the
   implementation.  This interface should include common procedures such
   as startup, shutdown and re-authenticate signals.  It should also
   provision for extracting keying material.  For the PAA, the SME-PANA
   interface should also provide a method for communicating filtering
   parameters to the EP(s) when cryptographic filtering is used.  The
   filtering parameters include keying material used for bootstrapping
   secured transport such as IPsec.  When a PAA device interacts with
   the backend authentication server using a AAA protocol, its SME may
   also provide an interface to the AAA protocol to obtain authorization
   parameters such as the authorization lifetime and additional
   filtering parameters.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document's intent is to describe the PANA state machines fully.
   To this end, any security concerns with this document are likely a
   reflection of security concerns with PANA itself.
