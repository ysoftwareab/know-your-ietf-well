Abstract 
     iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family 
     of application protocols onto TCP/IP.  Datamover Architecture

Internet-Draft                     DA            18 October 2006 
 
     for iSCSI (DA) defines an abstract model in which the 
     movement of data between iSCSI end nodes is logically 
     separated from the rest of the iSCSI protocol in order to 
     allow iSCSI to adapt to innovations available in new IP 
     transports.  While DA defines the architectural functions 
     required of the class of Datamover protocols, it does not 
     define any specific Datamover protocols.  Each such Datamover 
     protocol, to be defined in a separate document, provides a 
     reliable transport for all iSCSI PDUs, but actually moves the 
     data required for certain iSCSI PDUs without involving the 
     remote iSCSI layer itself.  This document begins with an 
     introduction of a few new abstractions, defines a layered 
     architecture for iSCSI and Datamover protocols, and then 
     models the interactions within an iSCSI end node between the 
     iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer that happen in order to 
     transparently perform remote data movement within an IP 
     fabric.  It is intended that this definition would help map 
     iSCSI to generic RDMA-capable IP fabrics in the future 
     comprising TCP, SCTP, and possibly other underlying network 
     transport layers such as InfiniBand.

1.1  Definitions 

        I/O Buffer ­ A buffer that is used in a SCSI Read or Write 
            operation so SCSI data may be sent from or received into 
            that buffer. 

        Datamover protocol ­ A Datamover protocol is a data transfer 
            wire protocol for iSCSI that meets the requirements 
            stated in section 6. 

        Datamover layer ­ A Datamover layer is a protocol layer 
            within an end node that implements the Datamover 
            protocol. 

        Datamover-assisted - An iSCSI connection is said to be 
            "Datamover-assisted" when a Datamover layer is enabled 
            for moving control and data information on that iSCSI 
            connection.

2  Motivation 

   2.1  Intent 

        There are relatively new standard protocols that enable 
        Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and Remote Direct Data 
        Placement (RDDP) technologies to work over IP fabrics.  The 
        principal value proposition of these technologies is that 
        they enable one end node to place data in the final intended 
        buffer on the remote end node, thus eliminating the data copy 
        that traditionally happens in the receive path to move the 
        data to the final buffer.  The data copy avoidance in turn 
        eliminates unnecessary memory bandwidth consumption, substan-
        tially decreases the reassembly buffer size requirements, and 
        preserves CPU cycles that would otherwise be spent in 
        copying. 

         

        The iSCSI specification ([RFC3720]) defines a very detailed 
        data transfer model that employs SCSI Data-In PDUs, SCSI 
        Data-Out PDUs, and R2T PDUs, in addition to the SCSI Command 
        and SCSI Response PDUs that respectively create and conclude 
        the task context for the data transfer.  In the traditional 
        iSCSI model, the iSCSI protocol layer plays the central role 
        in pacing the data transfer and carrying out the ensuing data 
        transfer itself.  An alternative architecture would be for 
        iSCSI to delegate a large part of this data transfer role to 
        a separate protocol layer exclusively designed to move data, 
        which in turn is possibly aided by a data movement and 
        placement technology such as RDMA.   

          

        If iSCSI were operating in such RDMA environments, iSCSI 
        would be shielded from the low-level data transfer mechanics 
        but would only be privy to the conclusion of the requested 
        data transfer  Thus, there would be an effective "off-
        loading" of the work that an iSCSI protocol layer is expected 
        to perform, compared to today's iSCSI end nodes.  For such 
        RDMA environments, it is highly desirable that there be a 
        standard architecture to separate the data movement part of 
        the iSCSI protocol definition from the rest of the iSCSI 
        functionality.  This architecture precisely defines what a 
        Datamover layer is and also describes the model of 
        interactions between the iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer 
        (section 6). In order to satisfy this need, this document 
        presents a Datamover Architecture for iSCSI(DA) and also 
        summarizes a reasonable model for interactions between the 
        iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer for each of the iSCSI

     PDUs that are defined in [RFC3720].  Note that while DA is 
     motivated by the advent of RDMA over TCP/IP technology, the 
     architecture is not dependent on RDMA in its design.  DA is 
     intended to be a generic architectural framework for allowing 
     different types of Datamovers based on different types of 
     RDMA and transport protocols.  Adoption of this model will 
     help iSCSI proliferate into more environments.  

      

2.2  Interpretation of Requirements 

     This draft introduces certain architectural abstractions and 
     builds an abstract functional interface model between iSCSI 
     and Datamover protocol layers based on those abstractions.  
     This architectural style is motivated by the following 
     desires: 

          a)      Provide guidance to Datamover protocol designers 
                  with respect to the functional boundary between 
                  iSCSI and the Datamover protocols.  This guidance is 
                  critical since a significant part of the [RFC3720] 
                  protocol definition is left unchanged by DA 
                  architecture and the iSCSI notions from [RFC3720] 
                  (e.g., tasks, ITTs) are leveraged by the Datamover 
                  protocol. 

          b)      Aid existing iSCSI implementations to rapidly adapt 
                  to DA architecture, largely by leveraging the 
                  architectural abstractions also into implementation 
                  constructs ­ e.g., functions, APIs, modules.   

      

     However, note that DA architecture does not intend to impose 
     any implementation specifics per se.  When a DA architectural 
     concept (e.g., Operational Primitive) is described as 
     mandatory ("MUST") or recommended ("SHOULD") of a layer 
     (iSCSI or Datamover) in this document, the intent is that an 
     implementation respectively MUST or SHOULD produce the same 
     protocol action as what the model describes.  Specifically, 
     no implementation compliance in terms of names, modules or 
     API arguments etc. is implied by this Architecture by such 
     use of [RFC2119] terms, only a functional compliance is 
     sought.

3  Architectural layering of iSCSI and Datamover layers 

        Figure 1 illustrates an example of the architectural layering 
        of iSCSI and Datamover layers, in conjunction with a TCP/IP 
        implementation of RDMAP/DDP layers in an iSCSI end node.  
        Note that RDMAP/DDP/MPA, and TCP protocol layers are shown 
        here only as an example and in reality, DA is completely 
        oblivious to protocol layers below the Datamover layer.  The 
        RDMAP/DDP/MPA protocol stack provides a generic transport 
        service with direct data placement. There is no need to 
        tailor the implementation of this protocol stack to the 
        specific ULP to benefit from these services.

4  Design Overview 

        This document discusses and defines a model for interactions 
        between the iSCSI layer and a "Datamover layer" (see section 
        6) operating within an iSCSI end node, presumably 
        communicating with one or more iSCSI end nodes with similar 
        layering.  The model for interactions for handling different 
        iSCSI operations is called the "Datamover Interface" (DI, 
        section 10), while the architecture itself is called 
        "Datamover Architecture for iSCSI" (DA).  It is likely that 
        the architecture will have implications on the Datamover wire 
        protocols as DA places certain requirements and functionality 
        expectations on the Datamover layer.  However, this document 
        itself neither defines any new wire protocol for the 
        Datamover layer, nor any potential modifications to the iSCSI 
        wire protocol to employ the Datamover layer.  The scope of 
        this document is strictly limited to specifying the 
        architectural framework and the minimally required 
        interactions that happen within an iSCSI end node to leverage 
        the Datamover layer. 

         

        The design ideas behind DA can be summarized thus ­  

        1) DA defines an abstract functional interface model of iSCSI 
             layer's interactions with a Datamover layer below ­ i.e. DA 
             models the interactions between the logical "bottom" 
             interface of iSCSI and the logical "top" interface of a 
             Datamover. 

        2) DA guides the wire protocol for a Datamover layer by 
             defining the iSCSI knowledge that the Datamover layer may 
             utilize in its protocol definition (as an example, this 
             draft completely limits the notion of "iSCSI session" to 
             the iSCSI layer). 

        3) DA is designed to allow implementing the Datamover layer 
             either in hardware or in software. 

        4) DA is not a wire protocol spec, but an architecture that 
             also models the interactions between iSCSI and Datamover 
             layers operating within an iSCSI end node. 

        5) DA by design seeks to model the iSCSI-Datamover 
             interactions in a way that the modeling is independent of 
             the specifics of either a particular iSCSI revision, or a 
             specific instantiation of a Datamover layer.

Internet-Draft                        DA            18 October 2006 
  6) DA introduces and relies on the notion of a defined set of 
          Operational Primitives (could be seen as entry point 
          definitions in implementation terms) provided by each layer 
          to the other to carry out the request-response 
          interactions.  

     7) DA is intended to allow Datamover protocol definitions with 
          minimal changes to existing iSCSI implementations. 

     8) DA is designed to allow the iSCSI layer to completely rely 
          on the Datamover layer for all the data transport needs. 

     9) DA models the architecturally required minimal interactions 
          between an operational iSCSI layer and a Datamover layer to 
          realize the iSCSI-transparent data movement.  There may be 
          several other interactions in a typical implementation in 
          order to bootstrap a Datamover layer (or an iSCSI layer) 
          into operation, and they are outside the scope of this 
          document. 

     Note that in summary, DA is architected to support many 
     different Datamover protocols operating under the iSCSI 
     layer.  One such example of a Datamover protocol is iSER 
     ([iSER]).

5  Architectural Concepts 

5.1  iSCSI PDU types 

        This section defines the iSCSI PDU classification 
        terminology, as defined and used in this document.  Out of 
        the set of legal iSCSI PDUs defined in [RFC3720], as we will 
        see in section 5.1.1, the iSCSI layer does not request a SCSI 
        Data-Out PDU carrying solicited data for transmission across 
        the Datamover Interface per this architecture.  For this 
        reason, the SCSI Data-Out PDU carrying solicited data is 
        excluded in the iSCSI PDU classification we introduce in this 
        section (for SCSI Data-Out PDUs for unsolicited Data, see 
        section 5.1.2).  The rest of the legal iSCSI PDUs that may be 
        exchanged across the Datamover Interface are defined to 
        consist of two classes: 

             1) iSCSI data-type PDUs 

             2) iSCSI control-type PDUs 

         

5.1.1  iSCSI data-type PDUs 

        An iSCSI data-type PDU is defined as an iSCSI PDU that causes 
        data transfer, transparent to the remote iSCSI layer, to take 
        place between the peer iSCSI nodes on a full feature phase 
        iSCSI connection.  A data-type PDU, when requested for 
        transmission by the sender iSCSI layer, results in the 
        associated data transfer without the participation of the 
        remote iSCSI layer, i.e. the PDU itself is not delivered as-
        is to the remote iSCSI layer.  The following iSCSI PDUs 
        constitute the set of iSCSI data-type PDUs ­ 

             1) SCSI Data-In PDU    

             2) R2T PDU 

         

        In an iSCSI end node structured as an iSCSI layer and a 
        Datamover layer as defined in this document, the solicitation 
        for Data-out (i.e. R2T PDU) is not delivered to the initiator 
        iSCSI layer, per the definition of an iSCSI data-type PDU.  
        The data transfer is instead performed via the mechanisms 
        known to the Datamover layer (e.g. RDMA Read).  This in turn 
        implies that a SCSI Data-Out PDU for solicited data is never 
        requested for transmission across the Datamover Interface at 
        the initiator.

5.1.2  iSCSI control-type PDUs 

        Any iSCSI PDU that is not an iSCSI data-type PDU and also not 
        a solicited SCSI Data-out PDU is defined as an iSCSI control-
        type PDU.  Specifically, it is to be noted that SCSI Data-Out 
        PDUs for unsolicited Data are defined as iSCSI control-type 
        PDUs. 

5.2  Data_Descriptor 

        A Data_Descriptor is an information element that describes an 
        iSCSI/SCSI data buffer, provided by the iSCSI layer to its 
        local Datamover layer or by the Datamover layer to its local 
        iSCSI layer for identifying the data associated respectively 
        with the requested or completed operation.   

         

        In implementation terms, a Data_Descriptor may be a scatter-
        gather list describing a local buffer, the exact structure of 
        which is subject to the constraints imposed by the operating 
        environment on the local iSCSI node. 

         

5.3  Connection_Handle 

        A Connection_Handle is an information element that identifies 
        the particular iSCSI connection for which an inbound or 
        outbound iSCSI PDU is intended. A connection handle is unique 
        for a given pair of an iSCSI layer instance and a Datamover 
        layer instance.  The Connection_Handle qualifier is used in 
        all invocations of any Operational Primitive for connection 
        identification.  

         

        Note that the Connection_Handle is conceptually different 
        from the Connection Identifier (CID) defined by the iSCSI 
        specification.  While the CID is a unique identifier of an 
        iSCSI connection within an iSCSI session, the uniqueness of 
        the Connection_Handle extends to the entire iSCSI layer 
        instance coupled with the Datamover layer instance, across 
        possibly multiple iSCSI sessions.

   Internet-Draft                      DA            18 October 2006 
    
        In implementation terms, a Connection_Handle could be an 
        opaque identifier exchanged between the iSCSI layer and the 
        Datamover layer at the connection login time.  One may also 
        consider it to be similar in scope of uniqueness to a socket 
        identifier.  The exact structure and modalities of exchange 
        of a Connection_Handle between the two layers is 
        implementation-specific. 

         

5.4  Operational Primitive 

        An Operational Primitive, in this document, is an abstract 
        functional interface procedure that requests another layer to 
        perform a specific action on the requestor's behalf or 
        notifies the other layer of some event. The Datamover 
        Interface between an iSCSI layer instance and a Datamover 
        layer instance within an iSCSI end node uses a set of 
        Operational Primitives to define the functional interface 
        between the two layers. Note that not every invocation of an 
        Operational Primitive may elicit a response from the 
        requested layer.  This document describes the types of 
        Operational Primitives that are implicitly required and 
        provided by the iSCSI protocol layer as defined in [RFC3720], 
        and the semantics of these Primitives. 

         

        Note that ownership of buffers and data structures is likely 
        to be exchanged between the iSCSI layer and its local 
        Datamover layer in invoking the Operational Primitives 
        defined in this architecture.  The buffer management details, 
        including how buffers are allocated and released, are 
        implementation-specific and thus are outside the scope of 
        this document.  

         

        Each Operational Primitive invocation needs a certain 
        "information context" (e.g., Connection_Handle) for 
        performing the specific action being requested of it.  The 
        required information context is described in this document by 
        a listing of "qualifiers" on each invocation - in the style 
        of function call arguments.  No implementation specific is 
        however implied in this notation.  The "qualifiers" of any 
        Operational Primitive invocation specified in this document 
        thus represent the mandatory information context that the 
        Operational Primitive invocation MUST consider in performing 
        the action.  While the qualifiers are required, the method of 
        realizing the qualifiers (passed synchronously with

        invocation, or retrieved from task context, or retrieved from 
        shared memory etc.) is really up to the implementations. 

         

        When an Operational Primitive implementation is described as 
        mandatory ("MUST") or recommended ("SHOULD") of a layer 
        (iSCSI or Datamover) in this document, the intent is that an 
        implementation respectively MUST or SHOULD produce the same 
        protocol action as what the model describes. 

         

5.5  Transport Connection 

        The term "Transport Connection" is used in this document as a 
        generic term to represent the end-to-end logical connection 
        as defined by the underlying reliable transport protocol.  
        For this revision of this document, a Transport Connection 
        means only a TCP connection.

6  Datamover layer and Datamover protocol 

        This section introduces the notion of a "Datamover layer" and 
        "Datamover protocol" as meant in this document, and defines 
        the requirements on a Datamover protocol. 

         

        A Datamover layer is the implementation component that 
        realizes a Datamover protocol functionality in an iSCSI-
        capable end node, in communicating with other iSCSI end nodes 
        with similar capabilities.  More specifically, a "Datamover 
        layer" MUST provide the following functionality and the 
        "Datamover protocol" MUST consist of the wire protocol 
        required to realize the following functionality ­ 

        1) guarantee that all the necessary data transfers take place 
             when the local iSCSI layer requests transmitting a command 
             (in order to complete a SCSI command, for an initiator),or 
             sending/receiving an iSCSI data sequence (in order to 
             complete part of a SCSI command, for a target). 

        2) transport an iSCSI control-type PDU as-is to the peer 
             Datamover layer when requested to do so by the local iSCSI 
             layer. 

        3) provide notification and delivery to the iSCSI layer upon 
             arrival of an iSCSI control-type PDU. 

        4) provide an initiator-to-target data acknowledgement of SCSI 
             read data back to the target iSCSI layer, when requested. 

        5) provide an asynchronous notification upon completion of a 
             requested data transfer operation that moved data without 
             involving the iSCSI layer. 

        6) place the SCSI data into the I/O buffers or pick up the 
             SCSI data for transmission out of the data buffers that the 
             iSCSI layer had requested to be used for a SCSI I/O. 

        7) provide an error-free (i.e. must have at least the same 
             level of assurance of data integrity as the CRC32C iSCSI 
             data digest), reliable, in-order delivery transport 
             mechanism over IP networks in performing the data transfer, 
             and asynchronously notify the iSCSI layer upon iSCSI 
             connection termination.

     Note that this architecture expects that each compliant 
     Datamover protocol will define the precise means of 
     satisfying the requirements specified in this section. 

      

     In order to meet the functional requirements listed in this 
     section, certain Datamover protocols may require pre-posted 
     buffers from the local iSCSI protocol layer via mechanisms 
     outside the scope of this document and in some 
     implementations, the absence of such buffers may result in a 
     connection failure.  Datamover protocols may also realize 
     these functional requirements via methods not explicitly 
     listed in this document.

7  Functional Overview 

     This section presents an overview of the functional 
     interactions between the iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer 
     as intended by this Architecture. 

      

7.1  Startup 

     The iSCSI Login Phase on an iSCSI connection occurs as 
     defined in [RFC3720].  The Architecture assumes that at the 
     end of the Login Phase, both the initiator and target, if 
     they had so decided, transition the connection to being 
     Datamover-assisted.  The precise means of how an iSCSI 
     initiator and an iSCSI target agree on having the connection 
     Datamover-assisted is defined by the Datamover protocol.  The 
     only architectural requirement is that all iSCSI interactions 
     in the iSCSI Full Feature Phase MUST be Datamover-assisted 
     subject to the prior agreement, meaning that Datamover 
     protocol is in the iSCSI-to-iSCSI communication path below 
     the iSCSI layer on either side as shown in Figure 1.  DA 
     defines the Enable_Datamover Operational Primitive (section 
     8.6) to bring about this transition to a Datamover-assisted 
     connection. 

      

     The Architecture also assumes that the Datamover layer may 
     require a certain number of opaque local resources for making 
     a connection Datamover-assisted.  DA thus defines the 
     Allocate_Connection_Resources Operational Primitive (section 
     8.4) to model this interaction.  This Primitive is intended 
     to be invoked on each side once the two sides decide (as 
     previously noted) to have the connection Datamover-assisted.  
     The expected sequence of Primitive invocations is depicted in 
     Figure 2 and Figure 3 in section 16.2.  Figure 4, Figure 5, 
     and Figure 6 illustrate how the Primitives may be employed to 
     deal with various legal login outcomes. 

      

7.2  Full Feature Phase 

     All iSCSI peer communication in the Full Feature Phase 
     happens through the Datamover layers if the iSCSI connection 
     is Datamover-assisted.  The Architecture assumes that a 
     Datamover layer may require a certain number of opaque local

     execution, these task-level resources in the Datamover layer

     are assumed to be transparently allocated on each task 
     initiation and deallocated on the conclusion of each task as 
     appropriate.  In exception scenarios however ­ in scenarios 
     that do not yield a SCSI Response for each task such as ABORT 
     TASK operation ­ the Architecture assumes that the Datamover 
     layer needs to be notified of the individual task 
     terminations to aid its task-level resource management.  DA 
     thus defines the Deallocate_Task_Resources Operational 
     Primitive (section 8.9) to model this task-resource 
     management.  In specifying the ITT qualifier for the 
     Deallocate_Task_Resources Primitive, the Architecture further 
     assumes that the Datamover layer tracks its opaque task-level 
     local resources by the iSCSI ITT.  DA also defines 
     Send_Control (section 8.1), Put_Data (section 8.2), Get_Data 
     (section 8.3), Data_Completion_Notify(section 9.3), 
     Data_ACK_Notify (section 9.4), and Control_Notify (section 
     9.1) Operational Primitives to model the various Full Feature 
     Phase interactions. 

      

     Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11 in section 16.2 show some 
     Full Feature Phase interactions ­ SCSI Write task, SCSI Read 
     task, and a SCSI Read Data acknowledgement respectively.  
     Figure 12 in section 16.2 illustrates how an ABORT TASK 
     operation can be modeled leading to deterministic resource 
     cleanup on the Datamover layer. 

      

7.3  Wrapup 

     Once an iSCSI connection becomes Datamover-assisted, the 
     connection continues in that state till the end of the Full 
     Feature Phase, i.e. the termination of the connection.  The 
     Architecture assumes that when a connection is normally 
     logged out, the Datamover layer needs to be notified so that 
     its connection-level opaque resources (see section 7.1) may 
     now be freed up.  DA thus defines a Connection_Terminate 
     Operational Primitive (section 8.7) to model this 
     interaction.  The Architecture further assumes that when a 
     connection termination happens without iSCSI layer's 
     involvement (e.g., TCP RST), the Datamover layer is capable 
     of locally cleaning up its task-level and connection-level 
     resources before notifying the iSCSI layer of the fact.  DA 
     thus defines the Connection_Terminate_Notify Operational 
     Primitive (section 9.2) to model this interaction.

   8  Operational Primitives provided by the Datamover layer 

        While the iSCSI specification itself does not have a notion 
        of Operational Primitives, any iSCSI layer implementing the 
        iSCSI specification functionally requires the following 
        Operational Primitives from its Datamover layer.  Thus, any 
        Datamover protocol compliant with this architecture MUST 
        implement the Operational Primitives described in this 
        section.  These Operational Primitives are invoked by the 
        iSCSI layer as appropriate.  Unless otherwise stated, all the 
        following Operational Primitives may be used both on the 
        initiator side and the target side.  In general programming 
        terminology, this set of Operational Primitives may be 
        construed as "down calls". 

         

              1) Send_Control 

              2) Put_Data 

              3) Get_Data 

              4) Allocate_Connection_Resources 

              5) Deallocate_Connection_Resources 

              6) Enable_Datamover 

              7) Connection_Terminate 

              8) Notice_Key_Values 

              9) Deallocate_Task_Resources 

          

8.1  Send_Control 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, iSCSI PDU-specific 
        qualifiers 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        An iSCSI layer requests its local Datamover layer to transmit 
        an iSCSI control-type PDU to the peer iSCSI layer operating 
        in the remote iSCSI node by this Operational Primitive.  The 
        Datamover layer performs the requested operation, and may add 
        its own protocol headers in doing so.  The iSCSI layer MUST

   Internet-Draft                     DA            18 October 2006 
    
        NOT invoke the Send_Control Operational Primitive on an iSCSI 
        connection that is not yet Datamover-assisted.  

         

        An initiator iSCSI layer requesting the transfer of a SCSI 
        command PDU or a target iSCSI layer requesting the transfer 
        of a SCSI response PDU are examples of invoking the 
        Send_Control Operational Primitive.  As section 10.3.1 
        illustrates later on, the iSCSI PDU-specific qualifiers in 
        this example are: BHS and AHS, DataDescriptorOut, 
        DataDescriptorIn, ImmediateDataSize, and UnsolicitedDataSize 

         

8.2  Put_Data 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, contents of a SCSI Data-
        In PDU header, Data_Descriptor, Notify_Enable 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        An iSCSI layer requests its local Datamover layer to transmit 
        the data identified by the Data_Descriptor for the SCSI Data-
        In PDU to the peer iSCSI layer on the remote iSCSI node by 
        this Operational Primitive.  The Datamover layer performs the 
        operation by using its own protocol means, completely 
        transparent to the remote iSCSI layer.  The iSCSI layer MUST 
        NOT invoke the Put_Data Operational Primitive on an iSCSI 
        connection that is not yet Datamover-assisted.  

         

        The Notify_Enable qualifier is used to request the local 
        Datamover layer to generate or to not generate the eventual 
        local completion notification to the iSCSI layer for this 
        Put_Data invocation.  For detailed semantics of this 
        qualifier, see section 9.3. 

         

        A Put_Data Primitive may only be invoked by an iSCSI layer on 
        the target to its local Datamover layer. 

         

        A target iSCSI layer requesting the transfer of an iSCSI read 
        data sequence (also known as a read burst) is an example of 
        invoking the Put_Data Operational Primitive.

8.3  Get_Data 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, contents of an R2T PDU, 
        Data_Descriptor, Notify_Enable 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        An iSCSI layer requests its local Datamover layer to retrieve 
        certain data identified by the R2T PDU from the peer iSCSI 
        layer on the remote iSCSI node into the buffer identified by 
        the Data_Descriptor by invoking this Operational Primitive.  
        The Datamover layer performs the operation by using its own 
        protocol means, completely transparent to the remote iSCSI 
        layer.  The iSCSI layer MUST NOT invoke the Get_Data 
        Operational Primitive on an iSCSI connection that is not yet 
        Datamover-assisted.  

         

        The Notify_Enable qualifier is used to request the local 
        Datamover layer to generate or to not generate the eventual 
        local completion notification to the iSCSI layer for this 
        Get_Data invocation.  For detailed semantics of this 
        qualifier, see section 9.3. 

         

        A Get_Data Primitive may only be invoked by an iSCSI layer on 
        the target to its local Datamover layer. 

         

        A target iSCSI layer requesting the transfer of an iSCSI 
        write data sequence (also known as a write burst) is an 
        example of invoking the Get_Data Operational Primitive. 

         

8.4  Allocate_Connection_Resources 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle[, Resource_Descriptor ] 

        Return Results: Status. 

        By invoking this Operational Primitive, an iSCSI layer 
        requests its local Datamover layer to perform all the 
        Datamover-specific resource allocations required for the full 
        feature phase of an iSCSI connection.  The Connection_Handle

   Internet-Draft                     DA            18 October 2006 
    
        identifies the connection the iSCSI layer is requesting the 
        resource allocation for in order to eventually transition the 
        connection to be a Datamover-assisted iSCSI connection.  Note 
        that the Datamover layer however does not allocate any 
        Datamover-specific task-level resources upon invocation of 
        this Primitive. 

         

        An iSCSI layer, in addition, optionally specifies the 
        implementation-specific resource requirements for the iSCSI 
        connection to the Datamover layer, by passing an input 
        qualifier called Resource_Descriptor.  The exact structure of 
        a Resource_Descriptor is implementation-dependent, and hence 
        structurally opaque to DA. 

         

        A return result of Status=success means that the 
        Allocate_Connection_Resources invocation corresponding to 
        that Connection_Handle succeeded.  If an 
        Allocate_Connection_Resources invocation is made for a 
        Connection_Handle for which an earlier invocation succeeded, 
        the return Status must be success and the request will be 
        ignored by the Datamover layer.  A return result of 
        Status=failure means that the Allocate_Connection_Resources 
        invocation corresponding to that Connection_Handle failed. 
        There MUST NOT be more than one Allocate_Connection_Resources 
        Primitive invocation outstanding for a given 
        Connection_Handle at any time. 

         

        The iSCSI layer must invoke the Allocate_Connection_Resources 
        Primitive before the invocation of the Enable_Datamover 
        Primitive. 

         

8.5  Deallocate_Connection_Resources 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle  

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        By invoking this Operational Primitive, an iSCSI layer 
        requests its local Datamover layer to deallocate all the 
        Datamover-specific resources that may have been allocated 
        earlier for the Transport Connection identified by the 
        Connection_Handle.  The iSCSI layer may invoke this

   Internet-Draft                     DA            18 October 2006 
    
        Operational Primitive when the Datamover-specific resources 
        associated with the Connection_Handle are no longer necessary 
        (such as the Login failure of the corresponding iSCSI 
        connection). 

         

8.6  Enable_Datamover 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, 
        Transport_Connection_Descriptor [, Final_Login_Response_PDU] 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        By invoking this Operational Primitive, an iSCSI layer 
        requests its local Datamover layer to assist all further 
        iSCSI exchanges on the iSCSI connection (i.e. to make the 
        connection Datamover-assisted) identified by the 
        Connection_Handle, for which the Datamover-specific resource 
        allocation was earlier made. The iSCSI layer MUST NOT invoke 
        the Enable_Datamover Operational Primitive for an iSCSI 
        connection unless there was a corresponding prior resource 
        allocation.  

         

        The Final_Login_Response_PDU input qualifier is applicable 
        only for a target, and contains the final Login Response that 
        concludes the iSCSI Login phase and which must be sent as a 
        byte stream as expected by the initiator iSCSI layer.  When 
        this qualifier is used, the target-Datamover layer MUST 
        transmit this final Login Response before Datamover 
        assistance is enabled for the Transport Connection. 

         

        The iSCSI layer identifies the specific Transport Connection 
        associated with the Connection_Handle to the Datamover layer 
        by specifying the Transport_Connection_Descriptor. The exact 
        structure of this Descriptor is implementation-dependent. 

         

8.7  Connection_Terminate 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle

        By invoking this Operational Primitive, an iSCSI layer 
        requests its local Datamover layer to terminate the Transport 
        Connection and deallocate all the connection and task 
        resources associated with the Connection_Handle.  When this 
        Operational Primitive invocation returns to the iSCSI layer, 
        the iSCSI layer may assume the full ownership of all the 
        iSCSI-level resources, e.g. I/O Buffers, associated with the 
        connection.  This Operational Primitive may be invoked only 
        with a valid Connection_Handle and the Transport Connection 
        associated with the Connection_Handle must already be 
        Datamover-assisted. 

         

8.8  Notice_Key_Values 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, Number of keys, a list 
        of Key-Value pairs 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        By invoking this Operational Primitive, an iSCSI layer 
        requests its local Datamover layer to take note of the 
        negotiated values of the listed keys for the Transport 
        Connection.  This Operational Primitive may be invoked only 
        with a valid Connection_Handle and the Key-Value pairs MUST 
        be the current values that were successfully agreed upon by 
        the iSCSI peers for the connection.  The Datamover layer may 
        use the values of the keys to aid the Datamover operation as 
        it deems appropriate.  The specific keys to be passed in as 
        input qualifiers and the point(s) in time this Operational 
        Primitive is invoked are implementation-dependent. 

         

8.9  Deallocate_Task_Resources 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, ITT 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        By invoking this Operational Primitive, an iSCSI layer 
        requests its local Datamover Layer to deallocate all 
        Datamover-specific resources that earlier may have been 
        allocated for the task identified by the ITT qualifier.  The 
        iSCSI layer uses this Operational Primitive during exception 
        processing when one or more active tasks are to be terminated 
        without corresponding SCSI Response PDUs.  This Primitive 
        MUST be invoked for each active task terminated without a 
        SCSI Response PDU.  This Primitive MUST NOT be invoked by the

     iSCSI layer when a SCSI Response PDU normally concludes a 
     task.  When a SCSI Response PDU normally concludes a task 
     (even if the SCSI Status was not a success), the Datamover 
     layer is assumed to have automatically deallocated all 
     Datamover-specific task resources for that task.  Refer to 
     section 7.2 for a related discussion on the Architectural 
     assumptions on the task-level Datamover resource management,

9  Operational Primitives provided by the iSCSI layer 

        While the iSCSI specification itself does not have a notion 
        of Operational Primitives, any iSCSI layer implementing the 
        iSCSI specification would have to provide the following 
        Operational Primitives to its local Datamover layer.  Thus, 
        any iSCSI protocol implementation compliant with this 
        architecture MUST implement the Operational Primitives 
        described in this section.  These Operational Primitives are 
        invoked by the Datamover layer as appropriate and when the 
        iSCSI connection is Datamover-assisted. Unless otherwise 
        stated, all the following Operational Primitives may be used 
        both on the initiator side and the target side.  In general 
        programming terminology, this set of Operational Primitives 
        may be construed as "up calls". 

         

             1) Control_Notify 

             2) Connection_Terminate_Notify 

             3) Data_Completion_Notify 

             4) Data_ACK_Notify 

         

9.1  Control_Notify 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, an iSCSI control-type 
        PDU. 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        A Datamover layer notifies its local iSCSI layer, via this 
        Operational Primitive, of the arrival of an iSCSI control-
        type PDU from the peer Datamover layer on the remote iSCSI 
        node.  The iSCSI layer processes the control-type PDU as 
        defined in [RFC3720]. 

         

        A target iSCSI layer being notified of the arrival of a SCSI 
        Command is an example of invoking the Control_Notify 
        Operational Primitive.

        Note that implementations may choose to describe the "iSCSI 
        control-type PDU" qualifier in this notification using a 
        Data_Descriptor (section 5.2) and not necessarily one 
        contiguous buffer.   

         

9.2  Connection_Terminate_Notify 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        A Datamover layer notifies its local iSCSI layer on an 
        unsolicited termination or failure of an iSCSI connection 
        providing the Connection_Handle associated with the iSCSI 
        Connection.  The iSCSI Layer MUST consider the 
        Connection_Handle to be invalid upon being so notified.  The 
        iSCSI layer processes the connection termination as defined 
        in [RFC3720].  The Datamover layer MUST deallocate the 
        connection and task resources associated with the terminated 
        connection before notifying the iSCSI layer of the 
        termination via this Operational Primitive.  

         

        A target iSCSI layer being notified of an ungraceful 
        connection termination by the Datamover layer when the 
        underlying Transport Connection is torn down due to receiving 
        a TCP RESET is one example when the 
        Connection_Terminate_Notify Operational Primitive is invoked. 

         

9.3  Data_Completion_Notify 

        Input qualifiers: Connection_Handle, ITT, SN 

        Return Results: Not specified. 

        A Datamover layer notifies its local iSCSI layer on 
        completing the retrieval of the data or upon sending the 
        data, as requested in a prior iSCSI data-type PDU, from/to 
        the peer Datamover layer on the remote iSCSI node via this 
        Operational Primitive.  The iSCSI layer processes the 
        operation as defined in [RFC3720].

   Internet-Draft                     DA            18 October 2006 
    
        SN may be either the DataSN associated with the SCSI Data-In 
        PDU or R2TSN associated with the R2T PDU depending on the 
        SCSI operation.  Note that, for targets, a TTT (see 
        [RFC3720]) could have been specified instead of an SN.  
        However, the considered choice was to leave the SN to be the 
        qualifier for two reasons ­ a) it is generic and applicable 
        to initiators and targets as well as Data-in and Data-out, 
        and b) having both SN and TTT qualifiers for the notification 
        was considered onerous on the Datamover layer, in terms of 
        state maintenance for each completion notification.  The 
        implication of this choice is that iSCSI target 
        implementations will have to adapt to using the ITT-SN tuple 
        in associating the solicited data to the appropriate task, 
        rather than the ITT-TTT tuple for doing the same. 

         

        If Notify_Enable was set in either a Put_Data or a Get_Data 
        invocation, the Datamover layer MUST invoke the 
        Data_Completion_Notify Operational Primitive upon completing 
        that requested data transfer.  If the Notify_Enable was 
        cleared in either a Put_Data or a Get_Data invocation, the 
        Datamover layer MUST NOT invoke the Data_Completion_Notify 
        Operational Primitive upon completing that requested data 
        transfer. 

         

        A Data_Completion_Notify invocation serves to notify the 
        iSCSI layer of the Put_Data or Get_Data completion 
        respectively.  As earlier noted in sections 8.2 and 8.3, 
        specific Datamover protocol definitions may restrict the 
        usage scope of Put_Data and Get_Data, and thus implicitly the 
        usage scope of Data_Completion_Notify. 

         

        A target iSCSI layer being notified of the retrieval of a 
        write data sequence is an example of invoking the 
        Data_Completion_Notify Operational Primitive.

     A target Datamover layer notifies its local iSCSI layer of 
     the arrival of a previously requested data acknowledgement 
     from the peer Datamover layer on the remote (initiator) iSCSI 
     node via this Operational Primitive.  The iSCSI layer 
     processes the data acknowledgement notification as defined in 
     [RFC3720]. 

      

     A target iSCSI layer being notified of the arrival of a data 
     acknowledgement for a certain SCSI Read data PDU is the only 
     example of invoking the Data_ACK_Notify Operational 
     Primitive.

10  Datamover Interface (DI) 

10.1  Overview 

        This chapter describes the interactions model between iSCSI 
        and Datamover layers when the iSCSI connection is Datamover-
        assisted so the iSCSI layer may carry out the following - 

        -  send iSCSI data-type PDUs and exchange iSCSI control-type 
             PDUs, and 

        -  handle asynchronous notifications such as completion of 
             data sequence transfer, and connection failure. 

        This chapter relies on the notion of Operational Primitives 
        (section 5.4) to define DI. 

10.2  Interactions for handling asynchronous notifications 

10.2.1  Connection termination 

        As stated in section 9.2, the Datamover layer notifies the 
        iSCSI layer of a failed or terminated connection via the 
        Connection_Terminate_Notify Operational Primitive.  The iSCSI 
        layer MUST consider the connection as unusable upon the 
        invocation of this Primitive and handle the connection 
        termination as specified in [RFC3720]. 

         

10.2.2  Data transfer completion 

        As stated in section 9.3, the Datamover layer notifies the 
        iSCSI layer of a completed data transfer operation via the 
        Data_Completion_Notify Operational Primitive.  The iSCSI 
        layer processes the transfer completion as specified in 
        [RFC3720]. 

         

10.2.2.1  Completion of a requested SCSI Data transfer 

        The Datamover layer, to notify the iSCSI layer of the 
        completion of a requested iSCSI data-type PDU transfer, uses 
        the Data_Completion_Notify Operational Primitive with the 
        following input qualifiers. 

         

              a) Connection_Handle 



    
    
   Chadalapaka, et al.    Expires April, 2007        [Page 33] 
    


   Internet-Draft                        DA            18 October 2006 
    
              b) ITT: Initiator Task Tag semantics as defined in 
                 [RFC3720] 

              c) SN: DataSN for a SCSI Data-in/Data-out PDU, and R2TSN 
                 for an iSCSI R2T PDU.  The semantics for both types of 
                 sequence numbers are as defined in [RFC3720].  

         

        The rationale for choosing SN is explained in section 9.3. 

        Every invocation of the Data_Completion_Notify Operational 
        Primitive MUST be preceded by an invocation of the Put_Data 
        or Get_Data Operational Primitive with the Notify_Enable 
        qualifier set by the iSCSI layer at an earlier point in time. 

         

10.2.3  Data acknowledgement 

        [RFC3720] allows the iSCSI targets to optionally solicit data 
        acknowledgement from the initiator for one or more Data-in 
        PDUs, via setting of the A-bit on a Data-in PDU. The 
        Data_ACK_Notify Operational Primitive with the following 
        input qualifiers is used by the target Datamover layer to 
        notify the local iSCSI layer of the arrival of data 
        acknowledgement of a previously solicited iSCSI read data 
        acknowledgement.  This Operational Primitive thus is appli-
        cable only to iSCSI targets. 

         

        a) Connection_Handle 

        b) ITT: Initiator Task Tag semantics as defined in [RFC3720] 

        c) DataSN: of the next SCSI Data-in PDU which immediately 
             follows the SCSI Data-in PDU with the A-bit set to which 
             this notification corresponds, with semantics as defined in 
             [RFC3720]. 

         

        Every invocation of the Data_ACK_Notify Operational Primitive 
        MUST be preceded by an invocation of the Put_Data Operational 
        Primitive by the iSCSI target layer with the A-bit set to 1 
        at an earlier point in time.

10.3  Interactions for sending an iSCSI PDU 

        This section discusses the interactions model for sending 
        each of the iSCSI PDUs defined in [RFC3720].  A 
        Connection_Handle (see section 5.3) is assumed to qualify 
        each of these interactions so that the Datamover layer can 
        route it to the appropriate Transport Connection.  The 
        qualifying Connection_Handle is not explicitly listed in the 
        subsequent sections. 

         

        Note that the defined list of input qualifiers represents the 
        semantically required set for the Datamover layer to consider 
        in implementing the Primitive in each interaction described 
        in this section (see section 5.4 for an elaboration).  
        Implementations may choose to deduce the qualifiers in ways 
        that are optimized for the implementation specifics.  Two 
        examples of this are: 

              1. For SCSI Command (section 10.3.1), deducing the 
                 ImmediateDataSize input qualifier from the 
                 DataSegmentLength field of the SCSI Command PDU. 

              2. For SCSI Data-Out (section 10.3.5.1), deducing the 
                 DataDescriptorOut input qualifier from the associated 
                 SCSI Command invocation qualifiers (assuming such state 
                 is maintained) in conjunction with BHS fields of the 
                 SCSI Data-out PDU.   

         

10.3.1  SCSI Command  

        The Send_Control Operational Primitive with the following 
        input qualifiers is used for requesting the transmission of a 
        SCSI Command PDU. 

         

        a) BHS and AHS, if any, of the SCSI Command PDU as defined in 
             [RFC3720] 

        b) DataDescriptorOut: that defines the I/O Buffer meant for 
             Data-out for the entire command, in the case of a write or 
             bidirectional command 

        c) DataDescriptorIn: that defines the I/O Buffer meant for 
             Data-in for the entire command, in the case of a read or 
             bidirectional command

        b) DataDescriptorStatus: that defines the iSCSI buffer which 
              contains the sense and response information for the command

        The Send_Control Operational Primitive with the following 
        input qualifiers is used for requesting the transmission of a 
        Task Management Function Request PDU. 

         

        a) BHS of the Task Management Function Request PDU as defined 
              in [RFC3720] 

        b) DataDescriptorOut: that defines the I/O Buffer meant for 
              Data-out for the entire command, in the case of a write or 
              bidirectional command  (Only valid if Function="TASK 
              REASSIGN" ­ [RFC3720] ] 

        c) DataDescriptorIn: that defines the I/O Buffer meant for

        target is not notified to the iSCSI layer using the 
        Control_Notify Primitive because the solicited SCSI Data-out 
        was not sent by the initiator iSCSI layer as control-type 
        PDUs. 

         

10.4.2.2  SCSI Data-in 

        The arrival of the SCSI Data-in is not notified to the iSCSI 
        layer by the Datamover layer at the initiator, because SCSI 
        Data-in is an iSCSI data-type PDU (see section 5.1).  The 
        iSCSI layer at the initiator however may infer the arrival of 
        the SCSI Data-in when it receives a subsequent notification 
        of the SCSI Response PDU via a Control_Notify invocation.

        While this document does not contemplate the possibility of a 
        Data-in PDU being received at the initiator iSCSI layer, 
        specific Datamover protocols may define how to deal with an 
        unexpected inbound SCSI Data-in PDU that may result in the 
        initiator iSCSI layer receiving the Data-in PDU.  This 
        document leaves the details of handling this error scenario 
        to the specific Datamover protocols, so each may define the 
        appropriate error handling specific to the Datamover 
        environment. 

         

   10.4.2.3  Ready To Transfer (R2T) 

        Because an R2T PDU is an iSCSI data-type PDU (see section 
        5.1) that is not delivered as-is to the initiator iSCSI 
        layer, the arrival of an R2T PDU is not notified to the iSCSI 
        layer by the Datamover layer.  When an iSCSI node sends an 
        R2T PDU to its local Datamover layer, the local and remote 
        Datamover layers transparently bring about the data transfer 
        requested by the R2T PDU. 

         

        While this document does not contemplate the possibility of 
        an R2T PDU being received at the initiator iSCSI layer, 
        specific Datamover protocols may define how to deal with an 
        unexpected inbound R2T PDU that may result in the initiator 
        iSCSI layer receiving the R2T PDU.  This document leaves the 
        details of handling this error scenario to the specific 
        Datamover protocols, so each may define the appropriate error 
        handling specific to the Datamover environment. 

         

10.4.3  Login Request 

        The Control_Notify Operational Primitive is used for 
        notifying the target iSCSI layer of the arrival of a Login 
        Request PDU.  Note that specific Datamover protocols may 
        choose to disallow the standard DA Primitives from being used 
        for the iSCSI Login phase.  When used in conjunction with 
        such Datamover protocols, the arrival of a Login Request 
        necessitating the Control_Notify Operational Primitive 
        invocation is clearly an error scenario, as the Login Request 
        PDU is arriving in the iSCSI full feature phase.  It is 
        outside the scope of this document to specify the resulting

         implementation behavior in this case - [RFC3720] already 
         defines the error handling in this error scenario.  

          

10.4.4  Login Response 

         The Control_Notify Operational Primitive is used for 
         notifying the initiator iSCSI layer of the arrival of a Login 
         Response PDU.  Note that specific Datamover protocols may 
         choose to disallow the standard DA Primitives from being used 
         for the iSCSI Login phase.  When used in conjunction with 
         such Datamover protocols, the arrival of a Login Response 
         necessitating the Control_Notify Operational Primitive 
         invocation is clearly an error scenario, as the Login 
         Response PDU is arriving in the iSCSI full feature phase.  It 
         is outside the scope of this document to specify the

11  Security Considerations 

   11.1  Architectural Considerations 

        DA enables compliant iSCSI implementations to realize a 
        control and data separation in the way they interact with 
        their Datamover protocols.  Note however that this separation 
        does not imply a separation in transport mediums between 
        control traffic and data traffic - basic iSCSI architecture 
        with respect to tasks and PDU relationships to tasks remains 
        unchanged.  [RFC3720] defines several MUST requirements on 
        ordering relationships across control and data for a given 
        task besides a mandatory deterministic task allegiance model 
        - DA does not change this basic architecture (DA has a 
        normative reference on [RFC3720]) nor allow any additional 
        flexibility in compliance in this area.  To summarize, 
        sending bulk data transfers (prompted by Put_Data and 
        Get_Data Primitive invocations) on a different transport 
        medium would be as ill-advised as sending just the Data-
        out/Data-in PDUs on a different TCP connection in RFC 3720-
        based iSCSI implementations.  Consequently, all the iSCSI-
        related security text in [RFC3723] is directly applicable to 
        a DA-enabled iSCSI implementation. 

         

        Another area with security implications is the Datamover 
        connection resource management model which DA defines ­ 
        particularly the Allocate_Connection_Resources Primitive.  An 
        inadvertent realization of this model could leave an iSCSI 
        implementation exposed to denial of service attacks.  As 
        Figure 2 and Figure 3 in section 16.2 illustrate, the most 
        effective countermeasure to this potential attack consists of 
        performing the Datamover resource allocation when the iSCSI 
        layer is sufficiently far along in the iSCSI Login Phase that 
        it is reasonably certain that the peer side is not an 
        attacker.  In particular, if the Login Phase includes a 
        SecurityNegotiation stage, an iSCSI end node MUST defer the 
        Datamover connection resource allocation (i.e. invoking the 
        Allocate_Connection_Resources Primitive) to the 
        LoginOperationalNegotiation stage ([RFC3720]) so that the 
        resource allocation happens post-authentication.  This 
        considerably minimizes the potential for a denial of service 
        attack.

11.2  Wire Protocol Considerations 

     In view of the fact that the DA architecture itself does not 
     define any new wire protocol nor propose modifications to the 
     existing protocols, there are no additional wire protocol 
     security considerations in employing DA itself.  However, a 
     DA-compliant iSCSI implementation MUST comply with all the 
     iSCSI-related requirements stipulated in [RFC3723] and 
     [RFC3720].  Note further that in realizing DA, each Datamover 
     protocol must define and elaborate as appropriate on any 
     additional security considerations resulting from the use of 
     that Datamover protocol. 

      

     All Datamover protocol designers are strongly recommended to 
     refer to [RDDPSEC] for the types of security issues to 
     consider.  While [RDDPSEC] elaborates on the security 
     considerations applicable to an RDDP-based Datamover 
     ([iSER]), the document is representative of the type of 
     analysis of resource exhaustion and the application of 
     countermeasures that needs to be done for any Datamover 
     protocol.

16  Appendix 

16.1  Design considerations for a Datamover protocol 

        This section discusses the specific considerations for RDMA-
        based and RDDP-based Datamover protocols. 

         

        a) Note that the modeling of interactions for SCSI Data-Out 
             (section 10.3.5.1) is only used for unsolicited data 
             transfer. 

        b) The modeling of interactions for SNACK (section 10.3.14, 
             and section 10.4.1) is not expected to be used given that 
             one of the design requirements on the Datamover is that it 
             "guarantees an error-free, reliable, in-order transport 
             mechanism" (section 6).  The interactions for sending and 
             receiving a SNACK are nevertheless modeled in this document 
             because the receiving iSCSI layer can deterministically 
             deal with an inadvertent SNACK.  This also shows the DA 
             designers' intent that DI is not meant to filter certain 
             types of PDUs. 

        c) The onus is on a reliable Datamover (per requirements 
             stated in section 6) to realize end-to-end data 
             acknowledgements via Datamover-specific means.  In view of 
             this, even data-ACK-type SNACKs are unnecessary to be used.  
             Consequently, an initiator may never request sending a 
             SNACK Request in this model assuming that the proactive 
             (timeout-driven) SNACK functionality is turned off in the 
             legacy iSCSI code. 

        d) Note that the current DA model for bootstrapping a 
             Connection_Handle into service ­ i.e. associating a new 
             iSCSI connection with a Connection_Handle ­ clearly implies 
             that the iSCSI connection must already be in full feature 
             phase when the Datamover layer comes into the stack.  This 
             further implies that the iSCSI login phase must be carried 
             out in the traditional "Byte streaming mode" with no 
             assistance or involvement from the Datamover layer. 

         

16.2  Examples of Datamover interactions 

        The figures described in this section provide some examples 
        of the usage of Operational Primitives in interactions 
        between the iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer. The 
        following abbreviations are used in this section.
