Abstract

For bidirectional lightpaths provisioning, in the case of optical nodes
that do not support wavelength conversion, it would be necessary to use
the same wavelength along the route on each direction. In certain 
optical network scenarios, the use of the same wavelength on both 
directions would be advantageous.  For instance, some ROADMs may 
add/drop the same wavelength simultaneously. In other cases, the users'
optical end nodes are equipped with fixed-wavelength transponders. 

This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling for 
bidirectional wavelength lightpaths that require the same wavelength on
both directions. By using an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC4420],
the extensions enable the new type lightpaths to support the low cost 
configuration at users' optical end nodes.

(optical lambdas) lightpath in the data plane.  It may be equipped with

be established across the network.

3. Introduction and Problem Statement

With the Lambda Switch (LSC) support defined in GMPLS [RFC3471] and 
RSVP-TE signaling [RFC3473], by properly configuring the wavelength 
selective switching elements such as ROADMs or OXCs at the transit 
nodes, both unidirectional and bidirectional wavelength (optical 
lambdas) lightpaths can be established in a wavelength-routed network.
To provide high-performance full-duplex transmission links between 
users' optical end nodes (e.g. computers, switches and routers, which 
are equipped with the necessary optical transmitters and responders) 
directly, bidirectional lightpaths should be established between users'
optical end nodes. 

This document considers the various scenarios where bidirectional 
lightpaths would be required for users' direct full-duplex end-end 
communications. By using the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC4420],
new extensions to RSVP-TE signaling are introduced. These extensions
enable the lightpath to support the required configuration to enable the
same wavelength to be used on both directions between the users' optical
end nodes. 

The extensions in this document would be applied to various scenarios. 
For example, only a specific wavelength among the multiplexed 
wavelengths could be added/dropped to an optical end node. In another 
case, some type of ROADMs may add/drop the same wavelength 
simultaneously. In these cases, using the same wavelength on both 
directions is a solution. Another problem that takes into account users'
convenience, avoiding port-remapping, is stated as follows.

3.1 Port-remapping Problem

In the context of CI-incapable [RFC3471] wavelength-routed networks, 
where the nodes in the networks cannot support wavelength conversion, 
the same wavelength on each link along a unidirectional lightpath 
should be reserved.  According to the definition in [RFC3471], a 
bidirectional lightpath can be seen as a pair of unidirectional
lightpaths, which are provisioned along the same route simultaneously
by the RSVP-TE signaling with Upstream Label and Label Set Objects in
the messages [RFC3473]. 
 
A previously defined bidirectional lightpath does not

necessarily require the same wavelength on both directions.  
In consequence, the selection of the upstream and downstream labels 
are independent.  That is to say, when establishing a bidirectional 
wavelength lightpath, the wavelengths on both directions selected 
using RSVP-TE may be different.  This may result in a 
wavelength-routed network specific port-remapping problem at both 
ends of the bidirectional lightpath.  This problem occurs in the 
following situations:

(1) Fixed wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexer like AWGs may be employed
at each node.  Each incoming and outgoing wavelength is with a dedicated
fixed port of AWG. For example, wavelength lambda 1 is on port 1, and 
wavelength lambda 2 is on port 2, and so on. See Fig.3.1.1.

(2) Compared to a wavelength-tunable optical transponder array, low cost
fixed-tuned optical transponder array may be employed at the edge node.
In an optical transponder, the optical responder is bound with the 
transmitter.  Each of the optical transmitters and responders are 
physically connected to one port of AWG or OXC according to the 
configuration. See Fig.3.1.2.

Consider a bidirectional lightpath with different wavelengths on two 
directions. The optical transmitter of which output wavelength is the 
same as the outgoing-wavelength (say lambda 1) is chosen first for 
using the lightpath. Then, the optical responder attached to that 
transmitter should be selected for receiving the incoming wavelength 
(say lambda 2). The responder generally can receive any of different 
wavelengths. Therefore, if another bidirectional lightpath is 
assigned the same outgoing wavelength (lambda 1) but with a different 
incoming wavelength (say lambda 3), the same transmitter and responder 
pair is selected. See Fig.3.1.3.

             +----+  
C. Optical responder R1 can receive optical signals on lambda 3 for 
another bidirectional lightpath.

Fig.3.1.3. Transmitter sends optical signals on the fixed-tuned 
wavelength; the responder can receive data on different wavelengths.

However, the communication using the transponder and the 
bidirectional lightpath with different wavelengths will not succeed 
under the situations (1) and (2) mentioned above. Remember the fixed 
port mapping that each incoming wavelength is fixed on a unique port 
of AWG due to the situation (1), and the optical responder is also 
fixedly connected to a unique port of AWG or OXC due to the situation 
(2). Conversely, the incoming wavelength may change every 
lightpath (see lambda 2 and lambda 3 in the above case) for the same 
outgoing wavelength (lambda 1). The current incoming wavelength 
(lambda 3) is not on the port of AWG to which the optical responder 
connects originally (lambda 2), see Fig. 3.1.4.  To connect the

port-mapping between the optical responder and AWG port.

3.2 Port-remapping with OXC

The port-remapping capability depends on the system configurations 
at users' optical end nodes.  For example, an OXC may be employed 
to switch the incoming wavelength from the port of AWG to the port 
which the optical responder is connected physically, see Fig. 3.2.1.  
However, equipping users' optical end nodes with OXCs introduces 
extra costs.  There exists a trade-off between port-remapping 
capability and cost/system complexity.

Users have various types of optical end node configurations to 
choose from.  Some configurations such as those equipped with OXCs might 
provide flexibility but could be costly and potentially complicated. 
Equally, while other configurations without OXCs might lack the 
flexibility they may be inexpensive and easy to use and maintain.  

4. Avoiding Port-remapping Problem

Which solution will be employed depends on the considerations of the 
flexibility and cost/complexity trade-off.  If users do not have 
port-remapping capability at optical end nodes, then it is 
necessary to avoid the port-remapping, and find a feasible approach 
to provide users full-duplex transmission capability with 
bidirectional lightpath.

4.1 Bidirectional Lightpath using Same Wavelength on Both Directions

A feasible approach is to establish a bidirectional lightpath with 
the same wavelength on both directions.  At the optical end node, 
fixed-tuned transponder array is connected to the proper ports of AWG 
according to the wavelength.  Optical transmitter and responder pair 
connecting the selected outgoing and incoming wavelength ports of AWG 
will be assigned to the bidirectional lightpath.  In this document, 
the bidirectional lightpath with the same wavelength on both 
directions is introduced as a complementary lightpath type.

4.2 Inefficient Alternate Solutions

4.2.1 Unidirectional Lightpaths with the Same Wavelength

Separately establishing two unidirectional lightpaths on different 
directions using the same wavelength between two optical end nodes might 
be an approach to support users' full-duplex transmission requirement.  
The same wavelength requirement could be achieved by sequentially 
scanning the wavelengths' availability on both directions.  Establish 
one-way lightpath first and verify the availability of the same 
wavelength on another lightpath.  If the wavelength is not available 
on both directions, release the former unidirectional lightpath, and 
repeat this process with a next wavelength, until an available 
wavelength is found on both directions.  However, this solution is 
inefficient because it might be time consuming during the scan process 
of the wavelength availability verification. 

4.2.2 Upstream Label Set and Label Set

Another approach is to extent the RSVP-TE signaling by defining an 
Upstream Label Set object, and to select the common free wavelengths 
along the upstream and downstream lightpaths.  Although it inherits 
the idea of Upstream Label from traditional bidirectional LSP, it is 
still not a neat solution and is inefficient.  

The simplest way is to only define an extension to the processing of 
Label Set [RFC3473], and leave the other processes untouched.  The 
issues related to this new functionality including an LSP_ATTRIBUTES 

Xu et al.                   Expires May 2008              [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     draft-xu-rsvpte-bidir-wave-01.txt     November 2007

object defined in [RFC4420] and the new procedure are described in 
the following sections. 

5. Using LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object

To trigger the new functionality at each GMPLS node, it is necessary 
to notify the receiver the new type lightpath request.  One 
multi-purpose flag/attribute parameter container object called 
LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and related mechanism defined in [RFC4420] meet 
this requirement. One bit in Attributes Flags TLV which indicates the 
new type lightpath, say, the bidirectional same wavelength lightpath 
will be present in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  Please refer to 
[RFC4420] for detailed descriptions of the Flag and related issues.

6. Label Set Object and Bidirectional Lightpath

Considering the system configuration mentioned above, it is needed 
to add a new function into RSVP-TE to support bidirectional lightpath 
with same wavelength on both directions.

6.1 Procedure

The lightpath setup procedure is described below:

(1) Ingress node adds the new type lightpath indication in an 
LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  It is propagated in the Path message in the 
same way as that of a Label Set object for downstream;

(2) On reception of a Path message containing both the new type 
lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set object, 
the receiver checks the local LSP database to see if the Label Set 
TLVs are acceptable on both directions jointly.  If there are 
acceptable wavelengths, then copy the values of them into new Label 
Set TLVs, and forward the Path message to the downstream node.  
Otherwise the Path message will be terminated, and a PathErr message 
with a "Routing problem/Label Set" indication will be generated;

(3) On reception of a Path message containing both such a new type 
lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and an Upstream Label 
object, the receiver MUST terminate the Path message using a PathErr 
message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes TLV" and Error Value set 
to the value of the new type lightpath TLV type code;

(4) On reception of a Path message containing both the new type 
lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set object, 
the egress node verifies whether the Label Set TLVs are acceptable, 
if one or more wavelengths are available on both directions, then any 
one available wavelength could be selected.  A Resv message is 
generated and propagated to upstream node;

(5) When a Resv message is received at an intermediate node, if it is a 
new type lightpath, the intermediate node allocates the label to 
interfaces on both directions and update internal database for this 
bidirectional same wavelength lightpath, then configures the local ROADM

Internet-Draft     draft-xu-rsvpte-bidir-wave-01.txt     November 2007

or OXC on both directions.

Except the procedure related to Label Set object, the other processes 
will be left untouched.

7. Backward Compatibility Considerations

Due to the introduction of new processing on Label Set object, it is 
required that each node in the lightpath is able to recognize the new 
type lightpath indication Flag carried by an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object, 
and deal with the new Label Set operation correctly.  It is noted that 
this new extension is not backward compatible.

According to the descriptions in [RFC4420], an LSR that does not 
recognize a TLV type code carried in this object MUST reject the Path 
message using a PathErr message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes 
TLV" and Error Value set to the value of the Attributes Flags TLV type 
code.

An LSR that does not recognize a bit set in the Attributes Flags TLV 
MUST reject the Path message using a PathErr message with Error Code 
"Unknown Attributes Bit" and Error Value set to the bit number of the 
new type lightpath Flag in the Attributes Flags.

The reader is referred to the detailed backward compatibility 
considerations expressed in [RFC4420].

8. Wavelength Assignment Issue

This signaling approach can be used for both combined routing and
wavelength assignment and separate routing and wavelength assignment
approaches, with and without Path Computation Element (PCE) support.
This signaling provides a unified signaling solution for different
scenarios.

a) Given a routing and wavelength assignment solution e.g. derived from
a PCE, an ingress node can put one wavelength label in Label set or a
Suggested label object to specify the wavelength. 

b) Given only routing solution e.g. from a PCE, an ingress node can set
one or more available wavelength label objects in Label set, and let the
egress node resolve the wavelength assignment in a distributed fashion.

c) Because this signaling solution can resolve wavelength assignment
problem itself, even without interaction with a PCE, by using an
explicit route e.g. manually, it is still possible to establish a
bidirectional lightpath. For example, a second lightpath is requested
between the same node pair of the previously established lightpath, e.g.
for quick recovery from failures, bidirectional signaling may negate a
PCE request. LSP set up time may also be reduced. Moreover, compared to
other crank back signaling approaches shown above, for distributed
wavelength assignment, this approach would have a lower blocking
probability and a shorter provisioning time.

Internet-Draft     draft-xu-rsvpte-bidir-wave-01.txt     November 2007

9. Link Bundling Issue

PCE path computation problems may occur when computing bidirectional
lightpaths. In a GMPLS network where multiple component links are
aggregated into a link bundle and advertised as a single bidirectional
TE link, the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) may indicate the
availability of a particular lambda in both directions on the TE link.
However, it may actually be the case that the lambda is only available
in one direction on one component link, and the other direction is only
available on a different component link. In this scenario, creating an
end-to-end path that uses the same lambdas and the same component links
in both directions presents a PCE path computation problem. This
signaling can be used to verify the solution received from PCE. 

10. IANA Considerations 

One bit in Attributes Flags TLV which indicates the new type lightpath,
say, the bidirectional same wavelength lightpath will be present in an
LSP_ATTRIBUTES object. For example, one possible position in Attributes
Flags TLV is suggested to be the 9th bit. The actions for IANA are under
discussion, and will be added to the document in a later draft.

11. Security Considerations

This document adds new procedure related only to Label Set object at 
each node.  It does not introduce any new direct security issues, and 
the reader is referred to the security considerations expressed in 
[RFC3473] and [RFC4420].
