                     Firewall Traversal for WebRTC
                draft-jennings-behave-rtcweb-firewall-04

Abstract

   Traversal of RTP through corporate firewalls has traditionally been
   complex, requiring the deployment of Session Border Controllers
   (SBCs) or wide open pinholes.  This draft proposes a simple technique
   that allows WebRTC based RTP traffic to traverse firewalls without
   complex firewall configuration and without deployment of SBCs or
   other middleboxes.

1.  Problem Statement

   WebRTC [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] based voice and video
   communications systems are becoming far more common inside
   enterprises, which often need voice and video media to traverse the
   enterprise firewall.  This can happen when a device inside the
   firewall such as a web browser or phone is exchanging media with a
   conference bridge or gateway outside the firewall, or it can happen
   when a device inside the firewall is talking to a device in another
   enterprise or behind a different firewall.

   This problem is not unique to WebRTC media of course.  It is common
   practice for enterprise administrators to block outbound UDP through
   the corporate firewall.  This is done for several reasons:

   1.  The lack of any kind of return messages means that there is no
       way to know that the recipient of the UDP traffic really wants
       it.  Infected computers within the enterprise could utilize UDP
       as the source of a DDoS attack.  If the firewall permitted such
       outbound traffic, the enterprise could in effect be a
       contributing source to such an attack.  By blocking UDP, the
       enterprise IT admin ensures that this cannot happen - at least
       not to external targets.

   2.  There have been prior attacks that have utilized UDP as a command
       and control channel for orchestrating DDoS attacks.  At the time,
       UDP had little usage within enterprises (most VoIP was internal
       to the enterprise when it existed at all).  Consequently, infosec
       departments have deemed it safer to block UDP outright in order
       to prevent such further incidents.

   3.  Many IT administrators enable various packet inspection
       operations on traffic flowing through the firewall.  High volume
       UDP traffic - such as voice or video - can be costly to inspect.
       As such, in cases where there is a need for traversal of such
       traffic, IT has preferred to deploy an SBC that, in essence,
       verifies that the traffic is VoIP and authorizes its egress.  The
       IT administrator then enables traffic to/from the SBC through the
       firewall.  In other words, VoIP authorization is delegated to an
       outsourced SBC.

   As more and more IP communications services move to the cloud, there
   is an increased need for VoIP traffic to traverse the enterprise
   firewall.  At the same time, the entire point of a cloud service is
   that it does not require the deployment of on premises
   infrastructure, making SBC-based solutions less desirable.  An
   alternative solution that has been historically used is to enable
   outbound UDP in the firewall to specific IP addresses, corresponding
   to the external service (TURN servers or conference servers) that the
   enterprise wishes to authorize.  With more applications running on
   virtual machines within cloud compute platforms like Amazon EC2, IP
   addresses are decreasingly usable as identifiers for a service.  VMs
   running TURN servers or conferencing servers may be established and
   torn down by the day, hour or even minute, with continuously changing
   IP addresses.  Given the multitenant nature of such providers, IT
   departments are unwilling to whitelist the IP addresses for the
   entire block used by such providers.

   Consequently, there is a growing need for solutions that allow VoIP
   traversal through the corporate firewall that alleviate the concerns
   above.  This issue is further exacerbated by the growing adoption of
   WebRTC by enterprise applications, which provide a ready source of
   RTP traffic which often needs to traverse the firewall.

2.  Solution Requirements

   We believe the solution must meet the following requirements:

   REQ-1: The solution must enable traversal of real-time media without
   requiring deployment of additional media intermediaries on premise
   (e.g., no SBC required)

   REQ-2: The solution must not require the whitelisting of specific
   external IP addresses

   REQ-3: The solution must enable the enterprise to be sure that the
   receiving party of the traffic desires the traffic

   REQ-4: The solution must work with P2P calls between users in
   different enterprises without requiring a TURN server

   REQ-5: The solution must work with cloud services external to the
   enterprise which terminate media on servers, such as conference
   servers, voicemail servers, and so on.

   REQ-6: The solution must not require decryption of either signaling
   or media traffic at the firewall or at any other intermediary

   REQ-7: The solution must allow the IT department to easily make
   policy decisions about which applications are allowed, or not
   allowed, to traverse the firewall

   REQ-8: The solution must not require inspection of every single
   packet that traverses the firewall

   REQ-9: The solution must provide a minimum level of proof that the
   traffic is WebRTC media or data and not something else

   REQ-10: The solution must work with WebRTC traffic.  Note that
   solving this for non-WebRTC is a non-requirement.

3.  Solution Overview

   Many of the reasons for blocking UDP at the corporate firewall have
   their origins in the lack of a three-way handshake for UDP traffic.
   TCP's three-way handshake ensures that the receiving party of the



Patel, et al.          Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               WebRTC Firewall                  March 2016


   connection desires the traffic.  Similarly, HTTP traffic easily
   traverses the firewall since it provides application identification
   information in the URL.

   Consequently, the solution proposed here relies on the ICE
   connectivity checks, which provide a similar handshake and ensure
   consent of the remote party.

   The firewall looks for an initial STUN transaction to a STUN server
   to learn which application is using the port (based on the STUN HOST
   attribute Section 6).  Next the firewall watches the outbound ICE
   connectivity check on that port and allows inbound ICE connectivity
   checks that are going to the same location that sent the outbound
   request and that have the correct random ufrag value that was created
   by the client inside the firewall.  After a successful ICE
   connectivity check, the firewall allows other media to flow on the
   same 5 tuple that had the successful ICE connectivity check.  Timers
   are used to removed the various pinholes created.

   In addition, the initial outbound STUN packets can contain the STUN
   HOST attribute which the firewall can use to make an authorization
   decision on the application.

   The end result is a system where:

   o  STUN packets are only allowed "in" if they know the crypto random
      username generated by a client inside the firewall

   o  STUN packers going "out" can be restricted by policy based on the
      hostname of the STUN server they are using

   o  Non STUN packets are only allowed "in" if they match a 5 tuple
      that a client inside the firewall sent a packet too

   o  Non STUN packets are only allowed "out" if the destination they
      are sending to did a stun consent handshake

4.  Firewall Processing

   The firewall processing is broken into four stages: recognizing STUN
   packets, mapping to an application, making a policy decision as to
   whether each STUN packet should trigger a pinhole to be created, and
   managing the lifetime of any pinholes that are created.

4.1.  Terminology

   The key words defined in [RFC2119] are used in this specification.

   The term 3-tuple is used to refer to IP address, protocol (which is
   always UDP), and port that the firewall sees as the address of the
   client inside the firewall.

   The term 4-tuple is used to refer to 3-tuple plus the ice ufrag that
   was send in the STUN request message for the client inside the
   firewall.

   The term 5-tuple is used to refer to the 3-tuple plus the IP address
   and port of the device outside the firewall.

   When matching a ufrag, if it is a STUN request that came from outside
   the firewall, the two halves of the username on either side of the
   ":" need to be swapped before matching.

4.2.  Recognizing STUN packets

   STUN messages all have a magic cookie value of 0x2112A442 in the 4th
   to 8th byte.  This can be used to quickly filter nearly all UDP
   packets that are not STUN packets.  Many firewalls are capable of
   doing this in hardware.  STUN supports an optional FINGERPRINT
   attribute that provides a 32 bit CRC over the message.

   Option A: Firewalls SHOULD look at outbound UDP packets and if they
   have the correct magic cookie they can classify them as STUN packets.

   Option B: The firewall looks for any outgoing STUN requests to the
   STUN port (3478).  When it finds one, it stores the 3 tuple of the
   source address port and protocol=UDP and for the next 30 seconds
   checks any packets from this 3 tuple to see if they are ICE
   connectivity checks.

   Open Issues:

   o  decide between option A and B.  A requires looking at all UDP
      packets but will likely work better than B.  Most firewalls look
      at all TCP packets so probably not too big of a deal.

   o  MAY, MUST, MUST NOT look at FINGERPRINT - what do we want here.
      If we put MAY or MUST, then browsers MUST include this.  If
      browsers are not required to provide this then I think we are more
      in the MUST NOT category.  If we do not use the fingerprint, there
      will be some small number of false positives.




Patel, et al.          Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               WebRTC Firewall                  March 2016


   o  Should do the analysis to see what harm comes of treating random
      packets as STUN packets.

   o  CJ Proposal: Browsers MUST send the fingerprint when sending STUN
      messages to STUN server but MAY use it when doing ICE connectivity
      checks.  This is to help save bandwidth as Justin Uberti was
      suggesting that change from approximately 50kbps to 100 kbps for
      ICE makes big difference for mobile devices.

4.3.  Application Mapping

   The STUN HOST attribute Section 6 carries the fully qualified domain
   name of the STUN server that is being contacted in the STUN requests.
   So for example, if a browser was on a page such as example.com and
   that page used the WebRTC calls to set up a connection to
   stun.example.com, the STUN request's HOST attribute would have the
   value stun.example.com.  Similarly when contacting a STUN or TURN
   server over TLS or DTLS, the TLS SNI [RFC6066] value provides the
   name of the host.  For systems that provide a unique STUN server name
   for each application, this allows the firewall to map the stun port
   to the application using it and use that for logging and making any
   policy decisions.

   Once the Firewall receives as STUN packet from the inside to the
   outside on a new 3-tuple.  It MUST create an internal record to track
   any additional traffic on this 3-tuple.  If the STUN packets contains
   an HOST attribute then the value it contains is saved in this record
   and referred to as the applications name.  Firewall might wish to put
   the application name in the log files for this 3-tuple.

   It is important to realize that any application inside the firewall
   can lie about the value of the HOST attribute.  However, a web
   browser that is trusted will not allow the Javascript running in the
   web browser to lie about the value of the HOST.

4.4.  Policy decision

   Once the firewall has received a STUN packet from inside the
   firewall, it needs to decide if the packet is acceptable.  For most
   situations the firewall SHOULD accept all outbound STUN packets.
   This is similar to allowing all outbound TCP flows.  Some firewalls
   may choose to look at other factors including the outside UDP port
   and the application name for this 3-tuple.

   In general WebRTC media can be sent on a wide range of UDP ports but
   the two ports that are commonly used are the the RTP port (5004) and
   TURN port (3478).  Some firewalls MAY choose to only allow flows




Patel, et al.          Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               WebRTC Firewall                  March 2016


   where the destination port on the outside of the firewall is one of
   these.

   Some firewalls MAY decide to white or blacklist connections based on
   the application name.

4.5.  Creating the pinhole rules

   Once a STUN packet is accepted, the firewall MUST create a temporary
   rule that causes the firewall to allow any inbound or outbound ICE
   messages on this 4-tuple.  This pinhole MUST to be valid for at least
   5 seconds from the time of creation.

   The firewall keeps track of the STUN transaction ID for all STUN
   requests messages that traverse the 4 tuple along with the 5 tuple
   they were sent on and direction (inbound or outbound).  If the
   firewall sees a STUN Success binding responses, with the matching
   transaction ID, and on the same 5 tuple but in the opposite direction
   as the STUN request, then a valid ICE connectivity check has
   happened.  Then the firewall MUST create a pinhole for this 5 tuple
   that allows any UDP traffic to flow across that 5 tuple.  This
   pinhole MUST to be valid for at least 30 seconds from the time of
   creation.

   The firewall continues watching ICE connectivity checks across this
   5-tuple as described in the previous paragraph and anytime the a
   valid ICE connectivity check happens, this effectively extends the
   lifetime of the pinhole by 30 seconds.  The procedures in [RFC7675]
   will ensure that an ICE connectivity check is done more often than
   every 30 seconds.  This is designed to make things work with behave
   compliant NATs and Firewalls as specified in [RFC4787].

4.6.  Media vs Data Statistics

   WebRTC can send audio and video as well as carry a data channel.
   Confidential data could leave an enterprise by a video camera being
   pointed at a document, but IT departments are often more concerned
   about the data channel.  It is easy for the firewall to separately
   track the amount of RTP media and non-media data for each WebRTC
   flow.  If the first byte of the UDP message is 23, it is non-media
   data; if it is in the range 127 to 192 it is audio or video data.
   More information about this can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes].  Network management systems on
   the firewall can track these two separately which can help identify
   unusual usage.

5.  WebRTC Browsers

   This specification would require browsers to include the FINGERPRINT
   and the HOST attributes in STUN requests to a STUN server used to
   gather candidates for this to work correctly.  Note they MUST not be
   included in STUN requests sent peer to peer or sent to ensure media
   consent.

   Open Issue: how much randomness for ICE ufrag

   o  ICE mandates at least 24 bits of randomness but we could require
      the browsers produce 64 bits of randomness?

   Open Issue: Does adding the HOST reduce user privacy?

   o  Consider the following case.  The user goes to
      https://facebook.com and initiates a call with another Facebook
      user using facebook.com as the name of the STUN server.  The
      domain facebook.com will appear (unencrypted) in the STUN packets
      sent from the browser to Facebook's TURN server.  Anyone along the
      network path could tell that the user is using Facebook's TURN
      server.  However, when the original TLS connection for the HTTP
      was made, the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the TLS of the HTTPS
      connection also revealed facebook.com, largely for the same
      reasons - so that the firewall would be able to see which
      applications are using the network.

   Open Issue: Would only including HOST when it matched the HTTP ORIGIN
   improve privacy?

   o  We could make this so that when used with WebRTC browsers, the
      HOST is only included in the STUN messages when the name of the
      STUN servers matches the HTTP ORIGIN of the web page initiating
      the STUN request.  It is not clear if this would improve privacy
      or not.

6.  STUN HOST attribute

   This specification defines a new STUN attribute called HOST and uses
   the syntax defined in Section 15 of [RFC5389].  This attribute is of
   type comprehension-optional.  The value of the HOST attribute is a
   variable length value.  It MUST contain a UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded
   sequence of characters.

   The HOST attribute identifies the fully qualified domain name of the
   application provider that is serving the WebRTC application and also
   operating the STUN server.  The WebRTC EndPoint MUST include this

   attribute as part of the ICE candidate gathering phase and there MUST
   be only one HOST attribute in a given STUN binding request.

7.  Deployment Advice

7.1.  WebRTC Servers

   WebRTC media servers and TURN servers with public IP address(es) that
   can receive incoming packets from anywhere on the Internet are
   suggested to listen for UDP on ports 5004 for RTP media servers and
   3478 for TURN servers.  UDP destined for port 53 or 123 if often
   allowed by firewalls that otherwise block UDP.

7.2.  Firewall Admins

   Often the approach has been to lock down everything, so that all UDP
   is blocked.  This simply causes applications to do things like embed
   the data in normal looking HTTP or HTTPS requests.  Malware and
   viruses use similar approaches.  Just turning off all UDP results in
   a poor user experience some of the time, which results in users
   moving to applications and devices outside the firewall.  The IT
   department loses the visibility into what is going on and can no
   longer protect its users when their computers become compromised.
   Allowing things that users want to use to work and monitoring them to
   detect when things have gone wrong is very valuable.

8.  Design Consideration

8.1.  Why not just use TCP?

   TODO

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the HOST attribute to the STUN attribute
   registry.  The values for HOST is to be allocated from the expert
   review comprehension-optional range of (0xC000 - 0xFFFF).

                       +-------+------+-----------+
                       | Value | Name | Reference |
                       +-------+------+-----------+
                       | TBD   | HOST | RFCXXXX   |
                       +-------+------+-----------+

   This specification defines the HOST attribute in Section 6.

10.  Security Considerations

   Enterprises have a range of concerns around WebRTC traffic traversal
   of the firewall.  The major concerns that are raised include:

   1.  Unlike TCP, UDP does not have a connection where a device inside
       the firewall has confirmed that it wants to talk to the thing
       outside.

   2.  Incoming UDP pinholes allow out of band packets to be spoofed
       into connecting as there is no equivalent of a TCP sequence
       number to check.

   3.  UDP has been used by malware command and control protocols so we
       block it.

   4.  We do not want enable ways for data to be exfiltrated outside the
       firewall with no monitoring.

   5.  An encrypted data channel in WebRTC can be used to bring malware
       into the company.

   6.  An encrypted media or data channel in WebRTC can be used as a
       command and control channel for malware inside the firewall.

   7.  An encrypted data channel in WebRTC can be used by an outside
       attacker to exfiltrate private files from inside the firewall.

   TODO - Describe to what degree theses are addressed.  Be clear about
   attacks due to Javascript inside the firewall and attacks due to
   executables inside the firewall.

10.1.  Privacy

   Unlike previous version of this draft, we think that using HOST
   instead of ORIGIN minimizes any privacy concerns.  The HOST is
   already known to the operator of the STUN server as they run it.  It
   often contains exactly the same information as the existing STUN
   REALM attribute.  It has roughly the same information as the TLS SNI
   [RFC6066] when STUN is run over DTLS.

11.  Alternate Approaches

11.1.  SDN Control of Firewall

   An alternative ways of solving this problem is for the Web
   Application running in the browser to inform the web site what ports
   and IP addresses it is using then the web site to contact the

   appropriate SDN controller and request the SDN controller tell the
   appropriate firewall what pinholes to open.  This can be made to work
   in some deployments but not all as it is often not clear how to find
   the correct SDN controller or set up a relationship such that the SDN
   controller trusts a website outside the firewall wall enough to let
   it tell the controller to open wholes in the Firewall.

   SDN based approaches should be pursued as well as this approach as
   they compliment each other.

11.2.  Any Cast White List

   Deploying media or TURN servers on a single any-cast IP address also
   makes it easier for firewall administrators to whitelist the address.
   Concerns have been raised that two packets sent from the same host to
   a given any-cast address may get delivered to different servers.
   This is certainly possible in theory but in practice it does not seem
   be happen in limited experiments done so far.

   Many thanks to review from Shaun Cooley, Teh Cheng, and Alissa
   Cooper.

   The definition of HOST STUN attribute was motivated by discussion
   around the draft-ietf-tram-stun-origin document and we want to thank
   Alan Johnston, Justin Uberti, John Yoakum, and Kundan Singh.
