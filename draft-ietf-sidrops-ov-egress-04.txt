               BGP RPKI-Based Origin Validation on Export
                    draft-ietf-sidrops-ov-egress-04

Abstract

   A BGP speaker may perform RPKI origin validation not only on routes
   received from BGP neighbors and routes that are redistributed from
   other routing protocols, but also on routes it sends to BGP
   neighbors.  For egress policy, it is important that the
   classification uses the 'effective origin AS' of the processed route,
   which may specifically be altered by the commonly available knobs
   such as removing private ASs, confederation handling, and other
   modifications of the origin AS.  This document updates [RFC6811].

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.  Introduction

   This document does not change the protocol or semantics of [RFC6811],
   BGP prefix origin validation.  It highlights an important use case of
   origin validation in eBGP egress policies, explaining specifics of
   correct implementation in this context.

   The term 'effective origin AS' as used in this document refers to the
   Route Origin ASN [RFC6811] of the UPDATE to be sent to neighboring
   BGP speakers.

   The effective origin AS of a BGP UPDATE is decided by configuration
   and outbound policy of the BGP speaker.  A validating BGP speaker
   MUST apply Route Origin Validation policy semantics (see [RFC6811]
   Sec 2 and [RFC8481] Sec 4) after applying any egress configuration
   and policy.

   This effective origin AS of the announcement might be affected by
   removal of private ASs, confederation [RFC5065], migration [RFC7705],

   etc.  Any AS_PATH modifications resulting in effective origin AS
   change MUST be taken into account.

   This document updates [RFC6811] by clarifying that implementations
   must use the effective origin AS to determine the Origin Validation
   state when applying egress policy.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI,
   [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), [RFC6482], RPKI-based
   Prefix Validation, [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications,
   [RFC8481].

3.  Egress Processing

   BGP implementations supporting RPKI-based origin validation MUST
   provide the same policy configuration primitives for decisions based
   on validation state available for use in ingress, redistribution, and
   egress policies.  When applied to egress policy, validation state
   MUST be determined using the effective origin AS of the route as it
   will (or would) be announced to the peer.  The effective origin AS
   may differ from that of the route in the RIB due to commonly
   available knobs such as: removal of private ASs, AS path
   manipulation, confederation handling, etc.

   Egress policy handling can provide more robust protection for
   outbound eBGP than relying solely on ingress (iBGP, eBGP, connected,
   static, etc.) redistribution being configured and working correctly -
   better support for the robustness principle.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Configurations may have complex policy where the effective origin AS
   may not be easily determined before the outbound policies have been
   run.  It SHOULD be possible to specify a selective origin validation
   policy to be applied after any existing non-validating outbound
   policies.

   An implementation SHOULD be able to list announcements that were not
   sent to a peer, e.g., because they were marked Invalid, as long as
   the router still has them in memory.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create security considerations beyond those of
   [RFC6811] and [RFC8481].  By facilitating more correct validation, it
   attempts to improve BGP reliability.
