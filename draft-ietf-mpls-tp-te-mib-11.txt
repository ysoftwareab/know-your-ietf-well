INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB              December 18, 2014


1. Introduction

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In
particular, it describes additional textual conventions and managed
objects for Tunnels, Identifiers and Label Switching Router to support
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) MIB modules for transport networks.
MIB modules defined in this document extend the existing MPLS MIB
objects in such a way that they support MPLS-TP but also other MPLS
networks as well. Hence, the MPLS-TP name is not included in the MIB
module name.

As described in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) Management Information
Base (MIB) definition [RFC3812], MPLS traffic engineering is concerned
with the creation and management of MPLS tunnels. This term is a
shorthand for a combination of one or more LSPs linking an ingress and
an egress LSR. Several types of point-to-point MPLS tunnels may be
constructed between a pair of LSRs A and B:

 - Unidirectional with a single LSP (say) from A to B.

 - Associated bidirectional consisting of two separately routed LSPs,
   one linking A to B and the other linking B to A. Together the pair 
   provide a single logical bidirectional transport path.

 - Co-routed bidirectional consisting of an associated bidirectional
   tunnel but with the second LSP from B to A following the reverse
   of the path of the LSP from A to B, in terms of both nodes and
   links.

Tunnels may be either statically configured by management action or
dynamically created using a LSP management protocol.

The existing MPLS TE MIB [RFC3812] and the Generalized Multiprotocol
Label Switching (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Management Information Base
[RFC4802] address only a subset of the combinations of statically and
dynamically configured tunnel types, catering for statically configured
unidirectional tunnels together with dynamically configured
unidirectional and co-routed bidirectional tunnels. They are also
restricted to two end point LSRs identified by IP addresses.

The MPLS-TP TE MIB defined in this document extends the MIB modules
defined in [RFC3812] to cover all six combinations (that is adding
support for statically configured associated and co-routed bidirectional
plus dynamically configured associated bidirectional tunnels). It also
extends support to end points that are identified other than with IP
addresses.

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB              December 18, 2014


This support is provided by a suite of four MIB modules that are to be
used in conjunction with the MIB modules defined in [RFC3812] and the
companion document [RFC3813] for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) tunnel
management.

At the time of writing, SNMP SET is no longer recommended as a way to
configure MPLS networks as was described in [RFC3812].  However, since
the MIB modules specified in this document extend and are intended to
work in parallel with the MIB modules for MPLS specified in [RFC3812],
certain objects defined here are specified with MAX-ACCESS of read-write
or read-create so that specifications of the base tables in [RFC3812]
and the extensions in this document are consistent. Although the
examples described in Section 9 specify means to configure MPLS-TP
tunnels in a similar way to the examples in [RFC3812], this should be
seen as indicating how the MIB values would be returned in the specified
circumstances having been configured by alternative means.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC
3410 [RFC3410].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally accessed
through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the
MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58 [RFC2578], STD 58
[RFC2579] and STD 58 [RFC2580].

4. Motivations

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Management
Information Base (MIB) [RFC3812] provides support for Traffic
Engineering tunnels. In MPLS, the actual transport of packets is
provided by Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  A transport service may be
composed of multiple LSPs. In order to clearly identify the MPLS-TP
service, as defined in [RFC6370], we use the term "MPLS-TP Tunnel" or
simply "tunnel". However, with MPLS-TP, the characteristics of the
tunnels were enhanced. For example, MPLS-TP tunnels, are bidirectional
in nature and could be used with non-IP identifiers for the tunnel end
points. As the existing MPLS-TE-STD-MIB and GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB were
defined mainly to support unidirectional tunnels and signaled co-routed
bidirectional tunnel definitions respectively, these existing MIB
modules are not sufficient to capture all the characteristics of the
tunnels. Hence, enhancing the MIB modules to support MPLS-TP tunnels is
required. As most of the attributes of MPLS Traffic Engineering tunnels
are also applicable to MPLS-TP tunnels, it is optimal to re-use and
extend the existing MIB module definition instead of defining a new MIB
module.

This document defines four additional MIB modules, namely MPLS-TE-EXT-
STD-MIB, MPLS-TC-EXT-STD-MIB, MPLS-ID-STD-MIB and MPLS-LSR-EXT-STD-MIB.
As these additional MIB modules are required for MPLS-TP functionality,
these are all defined in this document, instead of being documented
separately.

5. Feature List

The MIBs in this document satisfy the following requirements and
constraints:

The MIB modules, taken together, support statically configured and
dynamically signaled point-to-point, co-routed bidirectional and
associated bidirectional tunnels.

  - The MPLS tunnels need not be interfaces, but it is possible
    to configure an MPLS TP tunnel as an interface. Same ifType 150,

    as defined in section 8 of [RFC3812], will be used for MPLS-TP
    tunnels as well.

  - The mplsTunnelTable [RFC3812] is also to be used for MPLS-TP
    tunnels.

  - New MPLS-TP specific textual conventions and identifiers are
    required.

  - The mplsTunnelTable is sparsely extended to support MPLS-TP
    tunnel specific objects.

  - A node configuration table (mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable), as 
    detailed in the below section 6.1.2, is used to translate 
    the Global_ID::Node_ID or ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID to 
    the local identifier in order to index mplsTunnelTable.

  - The mplsXCTable is sparsely extended to support MPLS-TP
    XC(Cross Connect) specific objects.

  - The MIB module supports persistent, as well as non-persistent
    tunnels.

6. Outline

Traffic Engineering support for the MPLS-TP tunnels requires the set up
of the co-routed or associated bidirectional tunnel. The tables and MIB
modules that are mentioned in the below subsections support the
functionality described in documents [RFC5654] and [RFC6370].  These
tables support both IP compatible and ITU Carrier Code (ICC) based
tunnel configurations.

The below Figure 1 depicts how the table references are followed in this
MIB.

6.1 MIB Module Extensions

   Four MIB modules are extended to support MPLS-TP tunnels, namely,
   MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB, MPLS-TC-EXT-STD-MIB, MPLS-ID-STD-MIB and MPLS-
   LSR-EXT-STD-MIB. Following section provides the summary of changes. 

6.1.1 Summary of MIB Module changes

     - Node configuration table (mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable) for
       setting the local identifier for Tunnel Ingress and Egress
       identifiers.

     - Node IP map table (mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable) for querying 
       the local identifier for a given Global_ID and Node_ID.

     - Node ICC map table (mplsTunnelExtNodeIccMapTable) for querying 
       the local identifier for a given ICC_Operator_ID and Node_ID.

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB              December 18, 2014


     - Tunnel extension table (mplsTunnelExtTable) for setting up 
       MPLS-TP tunnels with sparse extension of mplsTunnelTable.

     - Textual conventions and object definitions for MPLS-TP Tunnels

     - Cross connect extension table (mplsXCExtTable) for setting up 
       the MPLS-TP LSPs.

   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.

6.2 MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB

   The TE MIB module extensions and details of the tables are described
   in the following sections. 

6.2.1 mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable

   The mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable is used to assign a local identifier
   for a given ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID or Global_ID::Node_ID
   combination as defined in [RFC6923] and [RFC6370] respectively. The
   CC is a string of two characters, each being an uppercase Basic Latin
   alphabetic (i.e., A-Z). The ICC is a string of one to six characters,
   each an upper case Basic Latin alphabetic (i.e., A-Z) or numeric
   (i.e., 0-9). All of the characters are encoded using [T.50] as
   described in [RFC6370].

   In the IP compatible mode, Global_ID::Node_ID, is used to uniquely
   identify a node. For each ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID or
   Global_ID::Node_ID, there is a unique entry in the table representing
   a node.  As the regular TE tunnels use IP address as LSR ID, the
   local identifier should be below the first valid IP address, which is
   16777216[1.0.0.0]. Every node is assigned a local identifier within a
   range of 0 to 16777215. This local identifier is used for indexing
   into mplsTunnelTable as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and
   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId.

   For IP compatible environment, MPLS-TP tunnel is indexed by Tunnel
   Index, Tunnel Instance, Source Global_ID, Source Node_ID, Destination
   Global_ID and Destination Node_ID.

   For ICC based environment, MPLS-TP tunnel is indexed by Tunnel Index,
   Tunnel Instance, Source CC, Source ICC, Source Node_ID, Destination
   CC, Destination ICC and Destination Node_ID.

   As mplsTunnelTable is indexed by mplsTunnelIndex,
   mplsTunnelInstance, mplsTunnelIngressLSRId, and
   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId, the MPLS-TP tunnel identifiers cannot be
   used directly.

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB              December 18, 2014


   The mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable will be used to store an entry for
   ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID or Global_ID::Node_ID with a local
   identifier to be used as LSR ID in mplsTunnelTable.

6.2.2 mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable

   The read-only mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable is used to query the local
   identifier assigned and stored in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for
   a given Global_ID::Node_ID. In order to query the local identifier,
   in the IP compatible mode, this table is indexed with 
   Global_ID::Node_ID. In the IP compatible mode for a TP tunnel, 
   Global_ID::Node_ID is used.

   A separate query is made to get the local identifier of both
   Ingress and Egress Global_ID::Node_ID identifiers. These local
   identifiers are used as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and
   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId, while indexing mplsTunnelTable.

6.2.3 mplsTunnelExtNodeIccMapTable

   The read-only mplsTunnelExtNodeIccMapTable is used to query the local
   identifier assigned and stored in the mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable
   for a given ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID.

   A separate query is made to get the local identifier of both
   Ingress and Egress ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID. These local identifiers
   are used as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId, 
   while indexing mplsTunnelTable.

6.2.4 mplsTunnelExtTable

   This table sparsely extends the mplsTunnelTable in order to support
   MPLS-TP tunnels with additional objects. All the additional
   attributes specific to supporting TP tunnel are contained in this
   extended table and could be accessed with the mplsTunnelTable
   indices.

   The gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable [RFC4802] should be used to provide
   per-tunnel packet performance information for the reverse direction
   of a bidirectional tunnel. It can be seen as supplementing the
   mplsTunnelPerfTable, which augments the mplsTunnelTable.

6.3 MPLS-TC-EXT-STD-MIB

   This MIB module contains textual Conventions for LSPs of MPLS based
   transport networks.

6.4 MPLS-ID-STD-MIB

   This MIB module contains generic object definitions for MPLS Traffic
   Engineering in transport networks.

6.5 MPLS-LSR-EXT-STD-MIB

   This MIB module contains generic object definitions (Cross connect
   extension table - mplsXCExtTable, for setting up the MPLS-TP LSPs
   with sparse extension of mplsXCTable) for MPLS LSRs in transport
   networks.

6.6 The Use of RowPointer

   This document follows the RowPointer usage as described in the
   section 10 of [RFC3812].

   A new RowPointer object, mplsTunnelExtOppositeDirPtr, is added to
   mplsTunnelExtTable of MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB MIB module. This RowPointer
   object points to the opposite direction tunnel entry.

   Two additional RowPointers objects, mplsXCExtTunnelPointer and
   mplsXCExtOppositeDirXCPtr are added to mplsXCExtTable of MPLS-LSR-
   EXT-STD-MIB. The RowPointer mplsXCExtTunnelPointer is read-only
   object used to indicate the back pointer to the tunnel entry. The
   RowPointer mplsXCExtOppositeDirXCPtr object points to the opposite
   direction XC entry. 

   If these RowPointer returns zeroDotZero, it implies that there is no
   entry associated with the RowPointer object.

7. MIB Modules Interdependencies

   This section provides an overview of the relationship between the
   MPLS-TP TE MIB module and other MPLS MIB modules.

   The arrows in the following diagram show a 'depends on'
   relationship. A relationship "MIB module A depends on MIB module B"
   means that MIB module A uses an object, object identifier, or
   textual convention defined in MIB module B, or that MIB module A
   contains a pointer (index or RowPointer) to an object in
   MIB module B.

       Figure 2: MIB modules interdependencies

       Thus:

        -  All the new MPLS extension MIB modules depend on
           MPLS-TC-EXT-STD-MIB.

        -  MPLS-ID-STD-MIB contains references to objects in
           MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812].

        -  MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB contains references to objects in
           MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812].

        -  MPLS-LSR-EXT-STD-MIB contains references to objects in
           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813].

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB              December 18, 2014


   The mplsTunnelExtTable sparsely extends the mplsTunnelTable of
   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812]. This helps in associating the reverse
   direction tunnel information.

   The mplsXCExtTable sparsely extends the mplsXCTable of
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813]. This helps in pointing back to the tunnel
   entry for easy tunnel access from XC entry.

   Note that all of the MIB modules shown above in the figure also
   have a dependency on MPLS-TC-STD-MIB.

8. Dependencies between MIB Module Tables

   The tables in MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB are related as shown on the diagram
   below.  The arrows indicate a reference from one table to another.

     Figure 3: Dependencies between MIB module tables

   An existing mplsTunnelTable uses the mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable
   table to map the Global_ID::Node_ID and/or ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID
   with the local number in order to accommodate in the existing tunnel
   table's ingress/egress LSR-id.

   New mplsTunnelExtTable table provides the reverse direction LSP
   information for the existing tunnel table in order to achieve
   bidirectional LSPs.

   mplsXCExtTable sparsely extends the mplsLsrXCTable to provide
   backward reference to tunnel entry.

9. Example of MPLS-TP Tunnel Setup

   In this section, we provide an example to configure MPLS-TP
   bidirectional tunnels with IP tunnel identifiers. This example
   provides the usage of MPLS-TP Tunnel MIB along with the extended MIB
   modules introduced in this document.

   Do note that a MPLS-TP tunnel could be setup statically as well as
   signaled via control plane. This example considers accessing MIB
   objects on a head-end for a static and signaled MPLS-TP tunnels. This
   section shows the configuration of the forward and reverse direction
   MPLS-TP LSPs that run between East and West and vice-versa. Only
   objects relevant to MPLS-TP tunnels are illustrated here.

   In mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable:

   {
   -- Non-IP Ingress LSR-Id (Index to the table)

     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigLocalId              = 1,

     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigGlobalId             = 1234,
     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigNodeId               = 10,
   -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)

   -- Non-IP Egress LSR-Id (Index to the table)
     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigLocalId              = 2,
     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigGlobalId             = 1234,
     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigNodeId               = 20,
   -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
     mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)
   }

   This will create an entry in the mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for a
   Global_ID::Node_ID. A separate entry is made for both Ingress LSR
   and Egress LSR.

   The following read-only mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable table is
   populated automatically upon creating an entry in
   mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable and this table is used to retrieve
   the local identifier for the given Global_ID::Node_ID.

   In mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable:

   {
   -- Global_ID (Index to the table)
     mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapGlobalId             = 1234,
   -- Node Identifier (Index to the table)
     mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapNodeId               = 10,
     mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapLocalId              = 1

   -- Global_ID (Index to the table)
     mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapGlobalId             = 1234,
   -- Node Identifier (Index to the table)
     mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapNodeId               = 20,
     mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapLocalId              = 2
   }

9.1. Example of MPLS-TP static co-routed bidirectional tunnel setup

   The following denotes the co-routed bidirectional tunnel "head"
   entry.

9.1.1. mplsTunnelEntry

     In mplsTunnelTable:

   {
     mplsTunnelIndex              = 1,
     mplsTunnelInstance           = 1,
   -- Local map number created in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for
   -- Ingress LSR-Id
     mplsTunnelIngressLSRId       = 1,

   -- Local map number created in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for
   -- Egress LSR-Id
     mplsTunnelEgressLSRId        = 2,
     mplsTunnelName               = "TP co-routed bidirectional LSP",
     mplsTunnelDescr              = "East to West",
     mplsTunnelIsIf               = true (1),
   --  RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column
     mplsTunnelXCPointer          =
                                mplsXCLspId.4.0.0.0.1.1.0.4.0.0.0.1,
     mplsTunnelSignallingProto    = none (1),
     mplsTunnelSetupPrio          = 0,
     mplsTunnelHoldingPrio        = 0,
     mplsTunnelSessionAttributes  = 0,
     mplsTunnelLocalProtectInUse  = false (0),
   --  RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column
     mplsTunnelResourcePointer    = mplsTunnelResourceMaxRate.5,
     mplsTunnelInstancePriority   = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopTableIndex      = 1,

     mplsTunnelIncludeAnyAffinity = 0,
     mplsTunnelIncludeAllAffinity = 0,
     mplsTunnelExcludeAnyAffinity = 0,
     mplsTunnelRole               = head (1),
   -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
     mplsTunnelRowStatus          = createAndGo (4)
   }

9.1.2. mplsTunnelExtEntry

   -- An MPLS extension table
   In mplsTunnelExtTable:
   {
     -- This opposite direction tunnel pointer may point to 0.0
     -- if co-routed bidirectional tunnel is managed by single tunnel
     -- entry
     mplsTunnelExtOppositeDirTnlPtr       = 0.0
     -- Set both the Ingress and Egress LocalId objects to TRUE as
     -- this tunnel entry uses the local identifiers.
     mplsTunnelExtIngressLSRLocalIdValid  = true,
     mplsTunnelExtEgressLSRLocalIdValid = true

   }

   We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment
   entries. These are done in [RFC3813] using the mplsInSegmentTable and
   mplsOutSegmentTable.

9.1.3. Forward direction mplsOutSegmentEntry

   For the forward direction,

   In mplsOutSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsOutSegmentIndex          = 0x0000001,
      mplsOutSegmentInterface      = 13, -- outgoing interface
      mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel   = true(1),
      mplsOutSegmentTopLabel       = 22, -- outgoing label

      -- RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column.
      mplsOutSegmentTrafficParamPtr   = 0.0,
      mplsOutSegmentRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)
   }

9.1.4. Reverse direction mplsInSegmentEntry

     For the reverse direction,

 


Venkatesan,  et al.      Expires June 21, 2015                 [Page 17]

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB              December 18, 2014


   In mplsInSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsInSegmentIndex           = 0x0000001
      mplsInSegmentLabel           = 21, -- incoming label
      mplsInSegmentNPop            = 1,
      mplsInSegmentInterface       = 13, -- incoming interface

      -- RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column.
      mplsInSegmentTrafficParamPtr    = 0.0,
      mplsInSegmentRowStatus          = createAndGo (4)
   }

   Next, two cross-connect entries are created in the mplsXCTable of the
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813], thereby associating the newly created
   segments together.

9.1.5. Forward direction mplsXCEntry

   In mplsXCTable:
   {
      mplsXCIndex                = 0x01,
      mplsXCInSegmentIndex       = 0x00000000,
      mplsXCOutSegmentIndex      = 0x00000001,
      mplsXCLspId                = 0x0102 -- unique ID

      -- only a single outgoing label
      mplsXCLabelStackIndex      = 0x00,
      mplsXCRowStatus            = createAndGo(4)

   }

9.1.6. Reverse direction mplsXCEntry

   In mplsXCTable:
   {
      mplsXCIndex                = 0x01,
      mplsXCInSegmentIndex       = 0x00000001,
      mplsXCOutSegmentIndex      = 0x00000000,
      mplsXCLspId                = 0x0102 -- unique ID
      -- only a single outgoing label
      mplsXCLabelStackIndex      = 0x00,
      mplsXCRowStatus            = createAndGo(4)
   }

   This table entry is extended by entry in the
   mplsXCExtTable.  Note that the nature of the 'extends'
   relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the
   mplsXCExtTable has the same index values as the entry in

   the mplsXCTable.

9.1.7. Forward direction mplsXCExtEntry

   In mplsXCExtTable (0x01, 0x00000000, 0x00000001)
   {
     -- Back pointer from XC table to Tunnel table
     mplsXCExtTunnelPointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.1.1.2
     mplsXCExtOppositeDirXCPtr         =
                                 mplsXCLspId.4.0.0.0.1.4.0.0.0.1.1.0
   }

9.1.8. Reverse direction mplsXCExtEntry

   Next for the reverse direction:

   In mplsXCExtTable (0x01, 0x00000001, 0x00000000)
   {
     -- Back pointer from XC table to Tunnel table
     mplsXCExtTunnelPointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.1.1.2
     mplsXCExtOppositeDirXCPtr         =
                                 mplsXCLspId.4.0.0.0.1.1.0.4.0.0.0.1
   }

9.2. Example of MPLS-TP static associated bidirectional tunnel setup

   The MPLS-TP associated bidirectional tunnel is implemented by two
   different unidirectional tunnels [Forward and Reverse LSPs] and these
   are associated together using mplsTunnelExtTable. Two different
   tunnel entries to provide the forward and reverse directions MAY be
   used for co-routed bidirectional tunnels as well.

   The following denotes the associated bidirectional forward tunnel
   "head" entry:

9.2.1. Forward direction mplsTunnelEntry

     In mplsTunnelTable:

   {
     mplsTunnelIndex              = 1,
     mplsTunnelInstance           = 1,
   -- Local map number created in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for
   -- Ingress LSR-Id
     mplsTunnelIngressLSRId       = 1,

   -- Local map number created in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for

9.2.8. Reverse direction mplsInSegmentEntry

   We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment
   entries. These are done in [RFC3813] using the mplsInSegmentTable and
   mplsOutSegmentTable.

   In mplsInSegmentTable:

   Next, two cross-connect entries are created in the mplsXCTable of the
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813], thereby associating the newly created
   segments together.

9.2.9. Reverse direction mplsXCEntry

      mplsXCLabelStackIndex      = 0x00,

      mplsXCRowStatus            = createAndGo(4)
   }

   This table entry is extended by entry in the
   mplsXCExtTable.  Note that the nature of the 'extends'
   relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the
   mplsXCExtTable has the same index values as the entry in
   the mplsXCTable.

9.3. Example of MPLS-TP signaled co-routed bidirectional tunnel setup

   The following denotes the co-routed bidirectional tunnel "head" entry
   and in intermediate and tail-end nodes, the tunnel table and its 
   associated tables are created by the local management subsystem 
   (e.g. agent) when the MPLS TP tunnel is signaled successfully.

14. Security Consideration

   This document follows the security consideration mentioned in the
   section 12 of [RFC3812]. These security considerations are also
   applicable to the MIB objects and tables defined in this draft, which
   are identified as below.

     - The common objects mplsIdGlobalId, mplsIdNodeId, mplsIdCc, and
       mplsIdIcc are used to define the identity of an MPLS-TP node for
       OAM purposes.  If write-access is allowed to these objects it
       offers the possibility for incorrect values to be entered that
       will confuse the information returned by OAM functions and
       possibly prevent OAM from operating correctly.  Furthermore,
       there is the possibility of inducing one node to impersonate
       another with confusing results.


     - mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable, mplsTunnelExtTable and
       mplsXCExtTable collectively contain objects to provision MPLS-TP

       tunnels, tunnel hops, and tunnel resources.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:


     - mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable, mplsTunnelExtTable,
       and mplsXCExtTable collectively show the MPLS-TP tunnel network
       topology characteristics. If an Administrator does not want to
       reveal this information, then these tables should be considered
       sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there
   is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
   and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
   module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826]. Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

15. IANA Considerations

   As described in [RFC4221], [RFC6639] and as requested in the MPLS-TC-
   STD-MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  There are 4 MPLS MIB Modules
   contained in this document, each of the following "IANA
   Considerations" subsections requests IANA for a new assignment under
   the mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a

   Standards Action as specified in [RFC5226].

15.1. IANA Considerations for MPLS-TC-EXT-STD-MIB

   IANA is requested to assign an OID { mplsStdMIB OID } to the MPLS-TC-
   EXT-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

15.2. IANA Considerations for MPLS-ID-STD-MIB
   IANA is requested to assign an OID { mplsStdMIB OID } to the MPLS-ID-
   STD-MIB module specified in this document.

15.3. IANA Considerations for MPLS-LSR-EXT-STD-MIB

   IANA is requested to assign an OID { mplsStdMIB OID } to the MPLS-
   LSR-EXT-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

15.4. IANA Considerations for MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB

   IANA is requested to assign an OID { mplsStdMIB OID } to the MPLS-TE-
   EXT-STD-MIB module specified in this document.
