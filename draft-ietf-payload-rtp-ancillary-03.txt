1.  Introduction

   This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the Society of Motion
   Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Ancillary data (ANC), as
   defined by SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291].  ANC can carry a range of data
   types, including time code, Closed Captioning, and the Active Format
   Description (AFD).

   ANC is generally associated with the carriage of metadata within the
   bit stream of a Serial Digital Interface (SDI) such as SMPTE ST 259
   [ST259], the standard definition (SD) Serial Digital Interface (with
   ANC data inserted as per SMPTE ST 125 [ST125]), or SMPTE ST 292-1
   [ST292], the 1.5 Gb/s Serial Digital Interface for high definition
   (HD) television applications.

   ANC data packet payload definitions for a specific application are
   specified by a SMPTE Standard, Recommended Practice, Registered
   Disclosure Document, or by a document generated by another
   organization, a company, or an individual (an Entity).  When a
   payload format is registered with SMPTE, an application document
   describing the payload format is required, and the registered
   ancillary data packet is identified by a registered data
   identification word.

   This memo describes an RTP payload that supports ANC data packets
   regardless of whether they originate from an SD or HD interface, or
   if the ANC data packet is from the vertical ancillary space (VANC) or
   the horizontal ancillary space (HANC), or if the ANC packet is
   located in the luma (Y) or color-difference (C) channel.  Sufficient
   information is provided to enable the ANC data packets at the output

   of the decoder to be restored to their original locations in the
   serial digital video signal raster (if that is desired).

   It should be noted that the ancillary data flag (ADF) word is not
   specifically carried in this RTP payload.  The ADF may be specified
   in a document defining an interconnecting digital video interface,
   otherwise a default ADF is specified by SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291].

   This ANC payload can be used by itself, or used along with a range of
   RTP video formats.  In particular, it has been designed so that it
   could be used along with RFC 4175 [RFC4175] "RTP Payload Format for
   Uncompressed Video" or RFC 5371 [RFC5371] "RTP Payload Format for
   JPEG 2000 Video Streams."

   The data model in this document for the ANC data RTP payload is based
   on the data model of SMPTE ST 2038 [ST2038], which standardizes the
   carriage of ANC data packets in an MPEG-2 Transport Stream.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  RTP Payload Format for SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary Data

   The format of an RTP packet containing SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary Data is
   shown below:

             Figure 1: SMPTE Ancillary Data RTP Packet Format

   RTP packet header fields SHALL be interpreted as per RFC 3550
   [RFC3550], with the following specifics:

   Timestamp: 32 bits
           The timestamp field is interpreted in a similar fashion to
           RFC 4175 [RFC4175]:

           For progressive scan video, the timestamp SHALL denote the
           sampling instant of the frame to which the ancillary data in
           the RTP packet belongs.  RTP packets MUST NOT include ANC
           data from multiple frames, and all RTP packets with ANC data
           belonging to the same frame MUST have the same timestamp.

           For interlaced video, the timestamp SHALL denote the sampling
           instant of the field to which the ancillary data in the RTP
           packet belongs.  RTP packets MUST NOT include ANC data from
           multiple fields, and all RTP packets belonging to the same
           field MUST have the same timestamp.

           A 90-kHz timestamp SHOULD be used in both cases.  If the
           sampling instant does not correspond to an integer value of
           the clock, the value SHALL be truncated to the next lowest
           integer, with no ambiguity.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload for Ancillary Data           March 2016


   Marker bit (M): 1 bit
           The marker bit set to "1" SHALL indicate the last RTP packet
           containing ANC data for a frame (for progressive scan video)
           or the last RTP packet containing ANC data for a field (for
           interlaced video).

2.1.  Payload Header Definitions

   The ANC RTP payload header fields are defined as:

   Extended Sequence Number: 16 bits
           The high order bits of the extended 32-bit sequence number,
           in network byte order.  This is the same as the Extended
           Sequence Number field in RFC 4175 [RFC4175].

   Length: 16 bits
           Number of octets of the ANC RTP payload, beginning with the
           "C" bit of the first ANC packet data.

   ANC_Count: 8 bits
           This field is the count of the total number of ANC data
           packets carried in the RTP payload.  A single ANC RTP packet
           payload SHALL NOT carry more than 255 ANC data packets.
           If more than 255 ANC data packets need to be carried in a
           field or frame, additional RTP packets carrying ANC data may
           be sent with the same RTP timestamp but with different
           sequence numbers.

   For each ANC data packet in the payload, the following ANC data
   packet header fields MUST be present:

   C: 1 bit
           For HD signals, this flag, when set to "1", indicates that
           the ANC data corresponds to the color-difference channel (C).
           When set to "0", this flag indicates that the ANC data
           corresponds to the luma (Y) channel.  For SD signals, this
           flag SHALL be set to "0".

   Line_Number: 11 bits
           This field contains the line number (as defined in ITU-R
           BT.1700 [BT1700] for SD video or ITU-R BT.1120 [BT1120] for
           HD video) that corresponds to the location of the ANC data
           packet in an SDI raster.  A value of 0x7FF (all bits in the
           field are '1') SHALL indicate that the ANC data is carried
           without a specific line location within the field or frame.

           Note that the lines that are available to convey ANC data are
           as defined in the applicable sample structure specification

           (e.g., SMPTE 274M [ST274], SMPTE ST 296 [ST296], ITU-R BT.656
           [BT656]) and may be further restricted per SMPTE RP 168
           [RP168].

   Horizontal_Offset: 12 bits
           This field defines the location of the ANC data packet in an
           SDI raster relative to the start of active video (SAV).  A
           value of 0 means that the Ancillary Data Flag (ADF) of the
           ANC data packet begins immediately following SAV.  For HD,
           this SHALL be in units of luma sample numbers as specified by
           the defining document of the particular image (e.g., SMPTE
           274M [ST274] for 1920 x 1080 active images, or SMPTE ST 296
           [ST296] for 1280 x 720 progressive active images).  For SD,
           this SHALL be in units of (27MHz) multiplexed word numbers,
           as specified in SMPTE ST 125 [ST125].  A value of 0xFFF (all
           bits in the field are '1') SHALL indicate that the ANC data
           is carried without any specific location within the line.

           Note that HANC space in the digital blanking area will
           generally have higher luma sample numbers than any samples in
           the active digital line.

   An ANC data packet with the header fields Line_Number of 0x7FF and
   Horizontal_Offset of 0xFFF SHALL be considered to be carried without
   any specific location within the field or frame, and in such a case
   the "C" field SHALL be ignored.

   For each ANC data packet in the payload, immediately after the ANC
   data packet header fields, the following data fields MUST be present,
   with the fields DID, SDID, Data_Count, User_Data_Words, and
   Checksum_Word representing the 10-bit words carried in the ANC data
   packet, as per SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291]:

   DID: 10 bits
           Data Identification Word

   SDID: 10 bits
           Secondary Data Identification Word.  Used only for a "Type 2"
           ANC data packet.  Note that in a "Type 1" ANC data packet,
           this word will actually carry the Data Block Number (DBN).

   Data_Count: 10 bits
           The lower 8 bits of Data_Count, corresponding to bits b7
           (MSB) through b0 (LSB) of the 10-bit Data_Count word, contain
           the actual count of 10-bit words in User_Data_Words.  Bit b8
           is the even parity for bits b7 through b0, and bit b9 is the
           inverse (logical NOT) of bit b8.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload for Ancillary Data           March 2016


   R: 2 reserved bits
           R is a field of two reserved bits that MUST be set to zero.

   User_Data_Words: integer number of 10 bit words
           User_Data_Words (UDW) are used to convey information of a
           type as identified by the DID word or the DID and SDID words.
           The number of 10-bit words in the UDW is defined by the
           Data_Count field.

   Checksum_Word: 10 bits
           The Checksum_Word can be used to determine the validity of
           the ANC data packet from the DID word through the UDW.  It
           consists of 10 bits, where bits b8 (MSB) through b0 (LSB)
           define the checksum value and bit b9 is the inverse (logical
           NOT) of bit b8.  The checksum value is equal to the nine
           least significant bits of the sum of the nine least
           significant bits of the DID word, the SDID word, the
           Data_Count word, and all User_Data_Words in the ANC data
           packet.  The checksum is initialized to zero before
           calculation, and any end carry resulting from the checksum
           calculation is ignored.

   word_align: bits as needed to complete 32-bit word
           Word align contains enough "0" bits as needed to complete the
           last 32-bit word of ANC packet's data in the RTP payload.  If
           an ANC data packet in the RTP payload ends aligned with a
           word boundary, there is no need to add any word alignment
           bits.  Word align should be used even for the last ANC data
           packet in an RTP packet.

   When reconstructing an SDI signal based on this payload, it is
   important to place ANC data packets into the locations indicated by
   the ANC payload header fields Line_Number and Horizontal_Offset, and
   also to follow the requirements of SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291] Section 7
   "Ancillary Data Space Formatting (Component or Composite Interface)",
   which include rules on the placement of initial ANC data into allowed
   spaces as well as the contiguity of ANC data packet sequences within
   those spaces in order to assure that the resulting ANC data packets
   in the SDI signal are valid.

   Senders of this payload SHOULD transmit available ANC data packets as
   soon as practical to reduce end-to-end latency, especially if
   receivers will be embedding the received ANC data packet into an SDI
   signal emission.  One millisecond is a reasonable upper bound for the
   amount of time between when an ANC data packet becomes available to a
   sender and the emission of an RTP payload containing that ANC data
   packet.

   ANC data packets with headers that specify specific location within a
   field or frame SHOULD be sent in raster scan order, both in terms of
   packing position within an RTP packet and in terms of transmission
   time of RTP packets.

3.  Payload Format Parameters

   This RTP payload format is identified using the video/smpte291 media
   type, which is registered in accordance with RFC 4855 [RFC4855], and
   using the template of RFC 4288 [RFC4288].

   Note that the Media Type Definition is in the "video" tree due to the
   expected use of SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary Data with video formats.

3.1.  Media Type Definition

   Type name: video

   Subtype name: smpte291

   Required parameters:

      Rate: RTP timestamp clock rate.

   Optional parameters:

      DID_SDID: Data identification and Secondary data identification
      words.

      The presence of the DID_SDID parameters signals that all ancillary
      data packets of this stream are of a particular type or types,
      i.e., labeled with a particular DIDs and SDIDs.  The DID_SDID
      parameter consists of the DID and SDID values in that order
      separated by a comma, with the DID/SDID pair preceded by a '{' and
      followed by a '}'.

      DID and SDID values should be specified in hexadecimal with a "0x"
      prefix (such as "0x61").  For example, EIA 608 Closed Caption data
      would be signalled with the parameter DID_SDID={0x61,0x02}.  If
      DID_SDID is not specified, then the ancillary data stream may
      potentially contain ancillary data packets of any type.

      Multiple DID_SDID parameters may be specified (separated by
      semicolons) to signal the presence of multiple types of ANC data
      in the stream.  DID_SDID={0x61,0x02};DID_SDID={0x41,0x05}, for
      example, signals the presence of EIA 608 Closed Captions as well
      as AFD/Bar Data.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload for Ancillary Data           March 2016


      DID and SDID values of SMPTE Registered ANC packet types can be
      found on the SMPTE Registry for Data Identification Word
      Assignments at:

      http://www.smpte-ra.org/smpte-ancillary-data-smpte-st-291

      DID and SDID values can be registered with SMPTE as per SMPTE ST
      291-1 [ST291].

   Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and binary; see
   Section 4.8 of RFC 4288 [RFC4288].

   Security considerations: See Section 5 of [this RFC]

   Interoperability considerations: Data items in smpte291 can be very
   diverse.  Receivers might only be capable of interpreting a subset of
   the possible data items.  Some implementations may care about the
   location of the ANC data packets in the SDI raster, but other
   implementations may not care.

   Published specification: [this RFC]

   Applications that use this media type: Devices that stream real-time
   professional video, especially those that must interoperate with
   legacy serial digital interfaces (SDI).

   Additional Information: none

   Person & email address to contact for further information: T.
   Edwards <thomas.edwards@fox.com>, IETF Payload Working Group
   <payload@ietf.org>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing, and
   hence is only defined for transfer via RTP RFC 3550 [RFC3550].
   Transport within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.

3.2.  Mapping to SDP

   The mapping of the above defined payload format media type and its
   parameters SHALL be done according to Section 3 of RFC 4855
   [RFC4855].

   o  The type name ("video") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The subtype name ("smpte291") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
      encoding name.

   o  The optional DID_SDID parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute
      as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   A sample SDP mapping for ancillary data is as follows:

   m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 112
   a=rtpmap:112 smpte291/90000
   a=fmtp:112 DID_SDID={0x61,0x02};DID_SDID={0x41,0x05}

   In this example, a dynamic payload type 112 is used for ancillary
   data.  The 90 kHz RTP timestamp rate is specified in the "a=rtpmap"
   line after the subtype.  The RTP sampling clock is 90 kHz.  In the
   "a=fmtp:" line, DID 0x61 and SDID 0x02 are specified (registered to
   EIA 608 Closed Caption Data by SMPTE), and also DID 0x41 and SDID
   0x05 (registered to AFD/Bar Data).

3.3.  Offer/Answer Model and Declarative Considerations

   When offering SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary data over RTP using the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) in an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] or in a
   declarative manner (e.g., SDP in the Real-Time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [RFC2326] or the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974]), the offerer could provide a list of streams available
   with specific DID & SDIDs, and the answerer could specify which
   streams with specific DID & SDIDs it would like to accept.

4.  IANA Considerations

   One media type (video/smpte291) has been defined and needs
   registration in the media types registry.  See Section 3.1

5.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and any applicable RTP profile, e.g., AVP
   [RFC3551].

   To avoid potential buffer overflow attacks, receivers should take
   care to validate that the ANC data packets in the RTP payload are of
   the appropriate length (using the Data_Count field) for the ANC data
   type specified by DID & SDID.  Also the Checksum_Word should be

   checked against the ANC data packet to ensure that its data has not
   been damaged in transit.

   Some receivers will simply move the ANC data packet bits from the RTP
   payload into a serial digital interface (SDI).  It may still be a
   good idea for these "re-embedders" to perform the above mentioned
   validity tests to avoid downstream SDI systems from becoming confused
   by bad ANC data packets, which could be used for a denial of service
   attack.

   "Re-embedders" into SDI should also double check that the Line_Number
   and Horizontal_Offset leads to the ANC data packet being inserted
   into a legal area to carry ancillary data in the SDI video bit stream
   of the output video format.
