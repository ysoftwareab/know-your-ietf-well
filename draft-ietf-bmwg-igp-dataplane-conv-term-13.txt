ABSTRACT
   This document describes the terminology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.   The terminology is to 
   be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through externally 
   observable (black box) data plane measurements.  The terminology 
   can be applied to any link-state IGP, such as ISIS and OSPF.

1. Introduction
   This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.  The motivation and 
   applicability for this benchmarking is provided in [Po07a].  The 
   methodology to be used for this benchmarking is described in [Po07m].  
   The methodology and terminology to be used for benchmarking Route 
   Convergence can be applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [Ca90] 
   and OSPF [Mo98].  The data plane is measured to obtain black-box 
   (externally observable) convergence benchmarking metrics.  The 
   purpose of this document is to introduce new terms required to 
   complete execution of the IGP Route Convergence Methodology [Po07m].  
   These terms apply to IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and IGPs.

   An example of Route Convergence as observed and measured from the 
   data plane is shown in Figure 1.  The graph in Figure 1 shows 
   Forwarding Rate versus Time.  Time 0 on the X-axis is on the far 
   right of the graph.  The Offered Load to the ingress interface of 
   the DUT SHOULD equal the measured maximum Throughput [Ba99][Ma98]
   of the DUT and the Forwarding Rate [Ma98] is measured at the egress 
   interfaces of the DUT.   The components of the graph and the metrics 
   are defined in the Term Definitions section.

3. Term Definitions
   3.1 Convergence Event
        
        Definition:
        The occurrence of a planned or unplanned action in the network 
        that results in a change in the egress interface of the Device
        Under Test (DUT) for routed packets.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Events include link loss, routing protocol session 
        loss, router failure, configuration change, and better next-hop
        learned via a routing protocol.

        Measurement Units:
        N/A

        Issues:        
        None

        See Also:
        Convergence Packet Loss
        Convergence Event Instant

   3.2 Route Convergence

        Definition:
        Route Convergence is the action to update all components of the
        router with the most recent route change(s) including the
        Routing Information Base (RIB) and Forwarding Information Base
        (FIB), along with software and hardware tables, such that
        forwarding is successful for one or more destinations.

        Discussion:
        Route Convergence is required after a Convergence Event.
        Route Convergence can be observed externally by the rerouting
        of data traffic to the next-best egress interface.  Also,
        Route Convergence may or may not be sustained over time.

        Measurement Units:
        N/A

        Issues:
        None

        See Also:

                       IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   3.3 Network Convergence  

        Definition:
        The completion of updating of all routing tables, including the 
        FIB, in all routers throughout the network.

        Discussion:
        Network Convergence requires completion of all Route Convergence
        operations for all routers in the network following a 
        Convergence Event.  Network Convergence can be observed by 
        recovery of System Under Test (SUT) Throughput to equal the 
        offered load, with no Stale Forwarding, and no Blenders 
        [Ca01][Ci03].

        Measurement Units:
        N/A

        Issues:
        None

        See Also:
        Route Convergence
        Stale Forwarding

   3.4 Full Convergence

        Definition:
        Route Convergence for an entire FIB in which complete recovery 
        from the Convergence Event is indicated by the DUT Throughput 
        equal to the offered load.

        Discussion:
        When benchmarking convergence, it is useful to measure
        the time to converge an entire FIB.  For example,
        a Convergence Event can be produced for an OSPF table of 
        5000 routes so that the time to converge routes 1 through 
        5000 is measured.  Full Convergence is externally observable 
        from the data plane when the Throughput of the data 
        plane traffic on the Next-Best Egress Interface equals the 
        offered load.

        Measurement Units:
        N/A

        Issues: None

   3.5  Packet Loss

        Definition:
        The number of packets that should have been forwarded
        by a DUT under steady state (constant) load that were 
        not forwarded due to lack of resources.

        Discussion:
        Packet Loss is a modified version of the term "Frame Loss Rate" 
        as defined in [Ba91].  The term "Frame Loss" is intended for 
        Ethernet Frames while "Packet Loss" is intended for IP packets.  
        Packet Loss can be measured as a reduction in forwarded traffic 
        from the Throughput [Ba91] of the DUT. 

        Measurement units:
        Number of N-octet offered packets that are not forwarded. 

        Issues:  None

        See Also:
        Convergence Packet Loss

   3.6 Convergence Packet Loss

        Definition:
        The number of packets lost due to a Convergence Event
        until Full Convergence occurs.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Packet Loss includes packets that were lost and 
        packets that were delayed due to buffering.  The Convergence 
        Packet Loss observed in a Packet Sampling Interval may or may 
        not be equal to the number of packets in the offered load 
        during the interval following a Convergence Event (see Figure 
        1).

        Measurement Units:
        number of packets

        Issues: None

   3.7 Convergence Event Instant

        Definition:
        The time instant that a Convergence Event becomes observable in 
        the data plane.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Event Instant is observable from the data 
        plane as the precise time that the device under test begins 
        to exhibit packet loss.  

        Measurement Units:
        hh:mm:ss:nnn, where 'nnn' is milliseconds

   3.8 Convergence Recovery Instant

        Definition:
        The time instant that Full Convergence is measured
        and then maintained for an interval of duration equal to 
        the Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time

        Discussion:
        Convergence Recovery Instant is measurable from the data 
        plane as the precise time that the device under test 
        achieves Full Convergence.  

        Measurement Units:
        hh:mm:ss:nnn, where 'nnn' is milliseconds

        Issues:

   3.9 Rate-Derived Convergence Time
        Definition:
        The amount of time for Convergence Packet Loss to persist upon 
        occurrence of a Convergence Event until occurrence of Route 
        Convergence.   

        Rate-Derived Convergence Time can be measured as the time 
        difference from the Convergence Event Instant to the 
        Convergence Recovery Instant, as shown with Equation 1.
        
        Equation 1 -  
          Rate-Derived Convergence Time = 
              Convergence Recovery Instant - Convergence Event Instant. 
              
        Discussion:
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time should be measured at the maximum
        Throughput.  Failure to achieve Full Convergence results in 
        a Rate-Derived Convergence Time benchmark of infinity.

        Measurement Units:
        seconds/milliseconds

        Issues:        
        None

   3.10 Convergence Event Transition
        Definition:
        A time interval observed following a Convergence Event in which
        Throughput gradually reduces to zero.

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Event Transition is best observed for Full 
        Convergence.  The egress packet rate observed during a 
        Convergence Event Transition may not decrease linearly.  Both 
        the offered load and the Packet Sampling Interval influence the 
        observations of the Convergence Event Transition.  For example, 
        even if the Convergence Event were to cause the Throughput 
        [Ba91] to drop to zero there would be some number of packets 
        observed, unless the Packet Sampling Interval is exactly 
        aligned with the Convergence Event.  This is further discussed 
        with the term "Packet Sampling Interval".

   3.11 Convergence Recovery Transition

        Definition:
        The characteristic of a router in which Throughput
        gradually increases to equal the offered load.

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Recovery Transition is best observed for 
        Full Convergence.  The egress packet rate observed during
        a Convergence Recovery Transition may not increase linearly.
        Both the offered load and the Packet Sampling Interval
        influence the observations of the Convergence Recovery
        Transition.  This is further discussed with the term 
        "Packet Sampling Interval".

   3.12 Loss-Derived Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time it takes for Route Convergence to 
        to be achieved as calculated from the Convergence Packet 
        Loss.  Loss-Derived Convergence Time can be calculated 
        from Convergence Packet Loss that occurs due to a 
        Convergence Event and Route Convergence as shown with 
        Equation 2.  

        Equation 2 - 
          Loss-Derived Convergence Time =
                Convergence Packets Loss / Offered Load
                NOTE: Units for this measurement are 
                packets / packets/second = seconds

INTERNET-DRAFT             Benchmarking Terminology for    July 2007
                         IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

        Discussion:
        Loss-Derived Convergence Time gives a better than 
        actual result when converging many routes simultaneously.  
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time takes the Convergence Recovery 
        Transition into account, but Loss-Derived Convergence Time 
        ignores the Route Convergence Recovery Transition because 
        it is obtained from the measured Convergence Packet Loss.  
        
        Ideally, the Convergence Event Transition and Convergence 
        Recovery Transition are instantaneous so that the 
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time = Loss-Derived Convergence Time.
        However, router implementations are less than ideal.
        For these reasons the preferred reporting benchmark for IGP 
        Route Convergence is the Rate-Derived Convergence Time.          
        Guidelines for reporting Loss-Derived Convergence Time are 
        provided in [Po07m].

   3.13 Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time for which Full Convergence is maintained 
        without additional packet loss.  

        Discussion:
        The purpose of the Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time is to 
        produce Convergence benchmarks protected against fluctuation 
        in Throughput after Full Convergence is observed.  The 
        Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time to be used is calculated 
        as shown in Equation 3.

        a. units are packets/pps = sec and

        b. C is a constant.  The RECOMMENDED value for C is 5 as 
        selected from working group consensus.  The value 5 was 
        obtained from RFC 2544 [Ba99] which uses 5 seconds as the 
        recommended time for residual frames and DUT restabilization.

        c. at least one packet per route in the FIB for all 
        routes in the FIB MUST be offered to the DUT per second.

   3.14 Restoration Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time for the router under test to restore
        traffic to the original outbound port after recovery from 
        a Convergence Event.

        Discussion:
        Restoration Convergence Time is the amount of time for routes 
        to converge to the original outbound port.  This is achieved 
        by recovering from the Convergence Event, such as restoring 
        the failed link.  Restoration Convergence Time is measured 
        using the Rate-Derived Convergence Time calculation technique, 
        as provided in Equation 1.  It is possible to have the 
        Restoration Convergence Time differ from the Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Time.

        Measurement Units:
        seconds or milliseconds

   3.15 Packet Sampling Interval

        Definition:  
        The interval at which the tester (test equipment) polls to make 
        measurements for arriving packet flows.

        Discussion: 
        Metrics measured at the Packet Sampling Interval MUST include
        Forwarding Rate and Convergence Packet Loss.


        Measurement Units:
        seconds or milliseconds

        Issues:        
        Packet Sampling Interval can influence the Convergence Graph.
        This is particularly true when implementations achieve Full 
        Convergence in less than 1 second.  The Convergence Event 
        Transition and Convergence Recovery Transition can become 
        exaggerated when the Packet Sampling Interval is too long.  
        This will produce a larger than actual Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Time.  The recommended value for configuration 
        of the Packet Sampling Interval is provided in [Po07m].

   3.17 Neighbor Interface

        Definition:
        The interface on the neighbor router or tester that is 
        directly linked to the DUT's Local Interface.

        Discussion:
        None

   3.19 Preferred Egress Interface

        Definition:
        The outbound interface from the DUT for traffic routed to the 
        preferred next-hop.

        Discussion:
        The Preferred Egress Interface is the egress interface prior 
        to a Convergence Event.

   3.20 Next-Best Egress Interface

        Definition:
        The outbound interface from the DUT for traffic routed to the 
        second-best next-hop.  It is the same media type and link speed
        as the Preferred Egress Interface

        Discussion:
        The Next-Best Egress Interface becomes the egress interface 
        after a Convergence Event.

  3.21 Stale Forwarding

        Definition:
        Forwarding of traffic to route entries that no longer exist 
        or to route entries with next-hops that are no longer preferred.

        Discussion:
        Stale Forwarding can be caused by a Convergence Event and is
        also known as a "black-hole" since it may produce packet loss.
        Stale Forwarding exists until Network Convergence is achieved.

   3.22 Nested Convergence Events

        Definition:
        The occurrence of a Convergence Event while the route 
        table is converging from a prior Convergence Event.  

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Events for a Nested Convergence Event
        MUST occur with different neighbors.  A common 
        observation from a Nested Convergence Event will be 
        the withdrawal of routes from one neighbor while the 
        routes of another neighbor are being installed.
