    Abstract

       It is expected that MPLS-based recovery could become a viable option
       for obtaining faster restoration than layer 3 rerouting. To deliver
       reliable service, however, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS)[1],
       [2] requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the
       traffic carried on the label switched paths (LSPs). This imposes
       certain requirements on the path recovery process [3], and requires
       procedures for the configuration of working and protection paths,
       for the communication of fault information to appropriate switching
       elements, and for the activation of appropriate switchover actions.
       This document specifies a mechanism for path protection switching
       and restoration in MPLS networks.

    1.0  Introduction

    With the migration of real-time and high-priority traffic to IP
    networks, and with the need for IP networks to increasingly carry
    mission-critical business data, network survivability has become
    critical for future IP networks. Current routing algorithms, despite
    being robust and survivable, can take a substantial amount of time, to
    recover from a failure, on the order of several seconds to minutes,
    which can cause serious disruption of service in the interim. This is
    unacceptable for many applications that require a highly reliable
    service, and has motivated network providers to give serious
    consideration to the issue of network survivability.

    Path-oriented technologies, such as MPLS, can be used to support
    advanced survivability requirements and enhance the reliability of
    IP networks. Different from legacy IP networks, MPLS networks
    establish label switched paths (LSPs), where packets with the same
    label follow the same path. This potentially allows MPLS networks to
    pre-establish protection LSPs for working LSPs, and achieve better
    protection switching times than those in legacy IP networks. With
    this objective in mind, the present contribution describes a
    mechanism to protect paths  (or path segments) in MPLS networks.
    Before discussing the specifics of this contribution, we first
    outline the major components of a path protection solution, and
    point out those that are within the scope of this document. A
    complete solution for path protection requires the following
    components:
       (i)  A method for selecting the working and protection paths.
       (ii) A method for signaling the setup of the working and o practical cases of interest: (a)
       when only the end node of a path is responsible for detecting
       faults, and (b) when all the nodes along the path are responsible
       for detecting faults. The main focus of this draft is the
       specification of an efficient fault notification mechanism that
       takes LSP merging into account (irrespective of whether they are
       physically or virtually merged). Switchover and switchback
       mechanisms also are also within the scope of the draft, but
       component (vi) is outside the scope of the draft, so the draft does
       not specify the details of the mechanisms used to detect that a
       fault has been repaired.

    2.0  Motivation and Purpose

       The framework document [3] lays out the various options for MPLS-
       based restoration/recovery. However, candidate approaches
       corresponding to various viable recovery options are still needed.
       Our work on proposing a path protection mechanism for MPLS networks
       is motivated by the belief that path protection (in conjunction with
       local repair) will be needed for truly reliable network operation.
       The purpose of this contribution is to propose a path protection
       mechanism that is:
       (i) fast (compared to Layer 3, with the goal of being comparable to
       SONET),
       (ii) scalable,
       (iii)bandwidth efficient,


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                 [Page 3]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       (iv)allows for path merging (i.e., is merging compatible), and
       (v) works at the MPLS layer (that is, only uses knowledge that is
       commonly available to MPLS routing and signaling modules).

    3.0  Key Features of the Proposed Mechanism

       This contribution describes an MPLS-based path recovery mechanism
       that can facilitate fast protection switching. The mechanism
       currently supports 1:1 protection [3].
       Bypass tunneling is for further study. First, because tunnel setup
       itself is not adequately defined yet, and second, because even
       assuming a tunnel could be setup, in the presence of tunnels (or
       tunneled segments) the mechanism still requires the ability to setup
       bi-directional tunnels, which is not defined yet.  The mechanism has
       several  timers to enable it to inter-work with protection
       mechanisms at other layers. Some of the key features of the
       protection mechanism are:

       -- Special tree structure to efficiently distribute fault and/or
       recovery information.

       Existing published proposals for MPLS recovery have not addressed
       the issue of fault notification in detail. Specifically, none of
       these proposals has discussed how to perform fault notification for
       the label merging case. In this draft, we propose a new fault
       notification structure called the reverse notification tree (RNT),
       which makes fault notification efficient and scalable (we provide
       details of the RNT in subsequent sections).

       -- Lightweight notification mechanism.

       Reliable transport mechanisms, such as TCP, are typically state-
       oriented and therefore difficult to scale. It is also very difficult
       to support point-to-multipoint communications based on reliable
       transport mechanisms. In our scheme, therefore, we use a stateless
       notification mechanism to achieve scalability. The notification is
       based on the transmission of UDP encapsulated IP packets that are
       sent periodically until the nodes responsible for switchover learn
       of the fault. Since no acknowledgements or handshaking between
       adjacent nodes is needed, the mechanism works only with timers and
       does not require the maintenance of state.

       --Minimize delays of a recovery cycle.

       An objective of the mechanism proposed in this draft is to minimize
       the duration of the recovery cycle. Thus a stateless transport
       mechanism together with high priority for control traffic minimizes
       notification delay. Likewise, a simple label merging approach to
       handle the traffic arriving on the working and protection paths



    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                 [Page 4]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       eliminates the need for synchronization (or handshaking) between the
       LSRs at the two ends of a recovery path. .
       -- Work at the MPLS layer (that is, use information available to the
       MPLS signaling and routing modules at the nodes)

       The mechanism is designed to operate using only MPLS constructs and
       the knowledge available to the MPLS modules at the nodes. Therefore,
       the mechanism assumes, by default, that the working and protection
       paths merge at a path merge LSR (PML) within the domain under
       consideration. However, since the mechanism does not depend on the
       path selection method, it also works in settings where a PML does
       not exist, and a path selection algorithm (outside the scope of this
       I-D) determines that the working and protection paths must terminate
       at different egress LSRs. Note, however, that for the path selection
       mechanism to be able to make this determination, it may need
       knowledge beyond that which is commonly available to the MPLS
       modules at a node. This is because determining whether a working
       path can be protected by another path with a different egress LSR
       requires Layer 3 knowledge to ascertain whether the LSR terminating
       the recovery path is acceptable. In the remainder of this document,
       we will focus on the PML case, with the understanding that the non-
       PML case is also supported.

       -- Ability to permit recovery mechanisms at different layers to
       coexist.

       In the evolving IP network infrastructure, recovery will
       increasingly be possible at different layers, and interworking of
       recovery mechanisms at different layers will be needed to ensure
       smooth network operation in the presence of faults. For example,
       optical layer or SONET layer recovery mechanisms could be used to
       recover optical paths or SONET channels. However, these mechanisms
       may initially be limited to ring topologies and may not provide the
       right level of granularity at which recovery might be desired,
       making MPLS-based protection desirable.
       While MPLS-based protection can be faster than IP layer rerouting it
       may be more costly to use (it may need to reserve extra bandwidth
       for example). In certain cases it may become too complicated for
       MPLS protection to be effective (for example, when there are
       multiple faults, or faults on both the working and the protection
       paths), making it necessary for IP layer rerouting to take over. In
       this draft, we assume that MPLS layer protection is used first, and,
       if necessary, recovery may be handed to IP layer rerouting following
       that.

       In addition to the key features outlined above, some other
       characteristics of the mechanism are:

       -- A liveness message to detect faults.

       Although fault detection is outside the scope of this draft, we will
       allow the existence of a generic æælivenessÆÆ message that can
       complement any fault detection mechanism. This liveness message may,


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                 [Page 5]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       for example, be provided as part of an user/control plane OAM
       function, or by an existing Hello message (as the RSVP ôHelloö
       message) with an appropriately set timer value. We do not define
       specific liveness mechanisms in this draft, deferring instead to
       work on OAM in MPLS, which is where we expect such a liveness
       message to be defined.

       Our assumption is that faults fall into different classes, and that
       different faults may be detected and corrected by different layers.
       Some faults (for example, the loss of signal or transmitter faults)
       may be detected and corrected by lower layer mechanisms (such as
       SONET), while others (for example, failure of the reverse link) may
       be detected (but may not be corrected) by lower layers and may be
       communicated to the MPLS layer. Still other faults (such as node
       failures or faults on the reverse link) may not be detected by lower
       layers, and will have to be detected and corrected at the MPLS
       layer.  Therefore, we adopt the liveness message as a complementary
       fault detection mechanism.

       We note that in this draft we confine our discussion of protection
       to a single MPLS domain, and do not consider protection/recovery
       across multiple MPLS domains or across multiple administrative
       boundaries. We note, however, that protection mechanisms in
       different domains may be concatenated, and that (at least initially)
       these mechanisms may work autonomously, across the (possibly)
       multiple points of attachment between two adjacent domains. However,
       coordination of protection mechanisms across multiple domains or
       across multiple transport technologies is currently out of the scope
       of this document.


    4.0 Core MPLS Path Protection Components

       This document assumes the terminology given in[1], [2], [3] , and
       introduces some additional terms. For the convenience of the reader,
       we repeat here some of the terminology from earlier documents.

       Working Path
       The protected path that carries traffic before the occurrence of a
       fault. The working path is the part of the LSP between the PSL and
       the PML (if any) or, in the absence of a PML, between the PSL and an
       egress LSR. A working path is denoted by the sequence of LSRs
       through which it passes. For example, in Fig. 1, the working path
       that starts at LSR 1 and terminates at LSR 7 is denoted by (1-2-3-4-
       6-7).

       Recovery Path
       The path by which traffic is restored after the occurrence of a
       fault. In other words, the path along which traffic is directed by
       the recovery mechanism. The recovery path can either be an
       equivalent recovery path and ensure no reduction in quality of
       service or be a limited recovery path and thereby not guarantee the
       same quality of service (or some other criteria of performance) as
       the working path. A recovery path is also denoted by the sequence of


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                 [Page 6]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       LSRs through which it passes. Again, in Fig. 1, the recovery path
       that starts at LSR 1 and terminates at LSR 7 is denoted by (1-5-7).

       Path Switch LSR (PSL)
       An LSR that is the transmitter of both the working path traffic and
       its corresponding recovery path traffic. The PSL is responsible for
       switching of the traffic between the working path and the recovery
       path. The PSL is the origin of the recovery traffic, but may or may
       not be the origin of the working traffic (that is the working path
       may be transiting the PSL).

       Path Merge LSR (PML)

       An LSR that receives both working path traffic and its corresponding
       recovery path traffic, and either merges their traffic into a single
       outgoing path, or, it is itself the destination, passes the traffic
       on to the higher layer protocols. The PML is the destination of the
       recovery path but may or may not be the destination of the working
       path.

       Intermediate LSR
       An LSR on a working or recovery path that is neither a PSL nor a PML
       for that path.

       FIS (Fault Indication Signal)
       A signal that indicates that a fault along a path has occurred. It
       is relayed by each intermediate LSR to its upstream or downstream
       neighbor, until it reaches an LSR that is set up to perform MPLS
       recovery.

       FRS (Fault Recovery Signal)
       A signal that indicates that a fault along a path has been repaired.
       Like the FIS, it is relayed by each intermediate LSR to its upstream
       or downstream neighbor, until it reaches an LSR that performs a
       switchback to the path for which the FIS was received.

       Liveness Message
       A generic name for any message exchanged periodically between two
       adjacent LSRs that serves as a link probing mechanism. It provides
       an integrity check of the forward and backward directions of the
       link between the two LSRs as well as a check of neighbor liveness.

       Path Continuity Test
       A test that verifies the integrity and continuity of a path or a
       path segment. The details of such a test are beyond the scope of
       this draft. (This could be accomplished, for example, by sending a
       control message along the same links and nodes as those traversed by
       the data traffic.)

    4.1 Reverse Notification Tree

       Since LSPs are unidirectional entities and recovery requires the
       notification of faults to the LSR(s) responsible for switchover to


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                 [Page 7]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       the recovery path, a mechanism must be provided for the fault
       indication and the fault repair notification to travel from the
       point of occurrence of the fault back to the PSL(s). The situation
       is complicated in the following two cases:

       (i) Physically merged LSPs: With label mergingmultiple working paths
       may converge to form a multipoint-to-point tree, with the PSLs as
       the leaves. In this case, therefore, the fault indication and -
       repair notification should be able to travel along a reverse path of
       the working path to all the PSLs affected by the fault. For example,
       in Fig. 1, for a fault along link 34 the affected PSLs are 1 and 9,
       where as for a fault along link 23, the only affected PSL is 1.

       (ii) Virtually merged LSPs: When several LSPs originating at
       different LSRs share a common segment beyond some node, and share a
       common identifier (such as the SESSION ID in RSVP-TE), we call such
       LSPs virtually merged. In this case also, savings in notification
       can be realized by sending a single notification towards the
       affected PSLs along segments shared by the LSPs emanating from these
       PSLs, and allowing the notification to branch out at the merge
       node(s). For example, in Fig. 1, for a failure along link 67 a
       single notification could be sent for working paths 1-2-3-4-6-7 and
       8-9-3-4-6-7 along their common segment 7-6-4-3.  The notification
       would branch out at node 3, which is the node where the LSP from
       node 1 to node 7 and the LSP from node 8 to node 7 merge.

       In both the cases above, an appropriate notification path can be
       provided by the reverse notification tree (RNT which is a point-to-
       multipoint tree that is an exact mirror image of the converged
       working paths, along which the FIS and the FRS travel.  (see Fig.
       1). There are several advantages to using an RNT:

       -- The RNT can be established in association with the working
       path(s), simply by making each LSR along a working path remember its
       upstream neighbor (or the collection of upstream neighbors whose
       working paths converge at the LSR and exit as one). Thus, no
       multicast routing is required. We elaborate more on the RNT in
       Section 3.

       -- Only one RNT is required for all the working paths that merge
       (either physically or virtually) to form the multipoint-to-point
       forward path. The RNT is rooted at an appropriately chosen LSR along
       the common segment of the merged working LSPs and is terminated at
       the PSLs. All intermediate LSRs on the converged working paths share
       the same RNT.
       Therefore, the RNT enables a reduction in the signaling overhead
       associated with recovery. Unlike schemes that treat each LSP
       independently, and require signaling between a PSL and the PML
       individually for each LSP, the RNT allows for only one  (or a small

       Figure 1: Illustration of MPLS protection configuration

    4.2 Protection Domain

       A protection domain is defined as the set of LSRs over which a
       working path and its corresponding recovery path are routed.  Thus,
       a protection domain is bounded by the LSRs that provide the
       switching and (if needed) the merging functions for MPLS protection,
       namely, the PSL and the PML (if present), respectively.
       In other words, a protection domain in bounded by the PSL at one
       end, and by the LSRs that form the end of the working or protection
       path at the other. In general, if the working and protection paths
       do not merge within the MPLS domain, the LSRs at the end of the
       working and protection paths may be egress LSRs. The PSL and the PML
       (alternatively, the end points of the working and protection paths
       within the MPLS domain under consideration) are identified during
       the setting up of an LSP, either via an offline algorithm or by an
       algorithm that runs at the head-end of an LSP to decide the specific
       nodes that the LSP must pass through. (Note that segments of the LSP
       between the PSL and the PML may be loosely routed, as long as the
       PSL and PML are known). Recovery should ideally be performed between
       the source and destination (end-to-end), but in some cases segment
       recovery may be desired (for example, when certain segments are more
       unreliable than others) or may be the only option (due to the
       topology of the network, see Fig. 1). For example, in Fig. 1, the
       working path 8-9-3-4-6-7, can only have protection on the segment 9-
       3-4-6-7.

       Note that when multiple LSPs merge into a single LSP or when
       multiple LSPs that share a common identifier follow the same path
       beyond some node, the working paths corresponding to these LSPs also
       converge. As explained in Section 2.4, an RNT can be used in this
       case for propagating the failure and repair notification back to the
       concerned PSL(s). We can therefore have a situation where different
       protection domains share a common RNT. A protection domain is
       denoted by specifying the working path and the recovery path. For
       example, in Fig. 1, the protection domain bounded by LSR 1 and LSR
       7, is denoted by (1-2-3-4-6-7, 1-5-7).

    4.2.1  Relationship between protection domains with different RNTs

       When protection domains have different RNTs, two cases may arise,
       depending on whether or not any portions of the two domains overlap,
       that is, have nodes or links in common. If the protection domains do
       not overlap, the protection domains are independent (note that by
       virtue of the RNTs in the two domains being different, neither the
       working paths nor the RNTs in the two domains can overlap). In other
       words, failures in one domain do not interact with failures in the
       other domain. For example, the protection domain defined by (9-3-4-
       6-7, 9-10-7) is completely independent of the domain defined by (11-
       13-5-15, 11-13-14-15). As a result, as long as faults occur in
       independent domains, the network shown in Fig. 1 can tolerate


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 10]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       multiple -faults (for example, simultaneous failures on the working
       path in each domain).

       If protection domains with disjoint RNTs overlap,  it implies that
       the protection path of one intersects the working path of the other.
       Therefore, although failures on the working paths of the two domains
       do not affect oneanother, failures on the protection path of one may
       affect the working path of the other and visa versa. For example,
       the protection domain defined by (1-2-3-4-6-7, 1-5-7) is not
       independent of the domain defined by (11-13-5-15, 11-13-14-15) since
       LSR 5 lies on the protection path in the former domain and on the
       working path in the latter domain.

    4.2.2 Relationship between protection domains with the same RNT

       When protection domains have the same RNT, different failures along
       the working paths may affect both paths differently.  As shown in
       Fig. 1, for example, working paths 1-2-3-4-5-7 and 9-3-4-6-7 share
       the same RNT. As a result, for a failure on some segments of the
       working path, both domains will be affected, resulting in a
       protection switch in both (for example, the segment 3-4-6-7 in Fig.
       1). Likewise, for failures on other segments of the working path,
       only one domain may be affected (for example, failure on segment 2-3
       affects only the first working path 1-2-3-4-6-7, where as failure on
       the segment 9-3 affects only the second working path 9-3-4-6-7).

    4.3 Multiple Faults

       We note that transferring the working traffic to the recovery path
       is enough to take care of multiple faults on the working path.
       However, if multiple faults happen such that there is at least one
       failure on both the working and recovery paths, MPLS layer recovery
       may no longer suffice. In this case, the network will either have to
       allow for Layer 3 rerouting or have the PSL inform the administrator
       via an alarm, thus enabling the manual reconfiguration of a
       different working and backup path. (An OAM functionality could
       greatly simplify such communication.) Note that for a PSL to be able
       to generate an alarm, it must also have a mechanism for detecting
       faults on the recovery path, such as a RNT for the recovery path (to
       allow for the fault notification on the recovery path to be
       propagated to the PSL).

    4.4 Timers and Thresholds

       For its proper operation, the protection mechanism described in this
       contribution uses the following timers and thresholds:

    5.0 Configuration

    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000


       In the following sections, we describe the operation of the path
       protection mechanism, and explain the various steps involved with
       reference to Fig. 1.

       Protection configuration consists of two aspects: establishing the
       protection path and creating the reverse notification tree.

    5.1 Establishing a Recovery/Protection Path

       The establishment of the recovery path requires the identification
       of the working path, and hence the protection domain. In most cases,
       the working path and its corresponding recovery path would be
       specified during LSP setup, either via a path selection algorithm
       (running at a centralized location or at an ingress LSR) or via
       administrative configuration. Observe that the specification of the
       path, does not, strictly speaking, require the entire path to be
       explicitly specified. Rather, it requires only that the PSL and PML
       (or in the absence of a PML, the path egress points out of the MPLS
       domain) be specified, with the segments between them being - loosely
       routed, if required. In other words, the path would be established
       between the two nodes at the boundaries of the protection domain via
       (possibly loose) explicit (or source) routing using LDP [4], [5]
       /RSVP [6], [7]signaling (alternatively, via constraint-based
       routing, or using manual configuration).

    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 13]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       PSL: The PSL initiates the working LSP and the recovery LSP. It is
       also responsible for storing information about which LSPs (or
       portions thereof) have protection enabled, and for maintaining a
       binding between outgoing labels specifying the working path and the
       protection/recovery path. The latter enables the switchover to the
       recovery path upon the receipt of a protection switch trigger. The
       PSL also maintains the timers, t4, t4Æ, t5, t6, and the threshold K.

       PML: The PML participates in the setting up of a recovery path as a
       merging LSR. . Therefore, it learns during signaling (or
       configuration) about which working and protection paths are merged
       to the same outgoing LSP. The PML also maintains timers t1, t1',t2,
       t2Æ, t4, t4', t5, t6, and the threshold K.

       Intermediate LSR: An intermediate LSR participates in the setup of
       the  recovery path, either as a normal LSR or as a merging LSR. It
       also maintains timers t1, t1', t2, t2Æ, t4, t4Æ, t5, t6, and the
       threshold K.

    5.2 Creating the RNT

       The RNT is used for propagating the FIS and the FRS, and can be
       created by a simple extension to the LSP setup process. During the
       establishment of the working path, the signaling message carries
       with it the identity (address) of the upstream node that sent it
       (for example, via the path attribute in RSVP). Each LSR along the
       path simply remembers the identity of its immediately prior upstream
       neighbor on each incoming link. Through the neighbor discovery
       mechanism of the routing protocol, each LSR finds the interface
       connecting it to the upstream LSRs. (It is assumed in this draft
       that there is a bi-directional connection between two neighboring
       LSRs, such as a bi-directional SONET link, a bi-directional lower
       layer network link (e.g., an ATM VP), or a pair of bi-directional
       tunnels over an IP subnetwork.) The node then creates an ææinverseÆÆ
       cross-connect table that for each protected outgoing LSP maintains a
       list of the incoming LSPs that merge into that outgoing LSP,
       together with the identity of the upstream node and incoming
       interface that each incoming LSP comes through. Upon receiving an
       FIS, an LSR extracts the labels contained in it (which are the
       labels of the protected LSPs that use the outgoing link that the FIS
       was received on) and checks whether the current LSR is the PSL for
       that LSP. If it is it terminates the FIS.  Otherwise, it consults
       its inverse cross-connect table to determine the identity of the
       upstream nodes that the protected LSPs come from, and creates and
       transmits an FIS to each of them.

       Therefore, based on whether the RNT is implemented at Layer 3 or
       Layer 2, two cases arise:

       If the RNT is implemented by a point-to-multipoint LSP, then the
       working path can be bound to the ingress label and interface of the
       RNT LSP at a LSR. The ingress label and interface can then be used
       as an index into the "inverse" cross-connect table to find the
       egress labels and interfaces of the RNT LSP as shown in Table 2.

    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 14]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       Upon receiving an FIS, an LSR extracts the labels and checks whether
       it is the PSL for that LSP. If it is, it terminates the FIS.
       Otherwise, it consults its inverse cross-connect table to determine
       the outgoing labels and interfaces, performs a label swap and
       forwards the FIS to the appropriate upstream node(s). For example,
       consider Figure 1, and assume that a Layer 2 point-to-multipoint
       RNT, rooted at LSR 7 and extending to LSRs 1 and 9, is bound to the
       multipoint-to-point forward paths starting at LSRs 1 and 8 and
       terminating at LSR 7. Now in case of a fault on link L[4,6], LSR 3
       receives an FIS on the RNT in a labeled packet with label N43. It
       uses this label as an index into its inverse cross-connect table,
       and learns that there are two previous nodes (namely those reachable
       via interfaces I23 and I93 respectively) that the FIS needs to be
       forwarded to. It encapsulates the received FIS into a labeled
       packets with labels N32 and N39, and dispatches them along
       interfaces I23 and I93 respectively.

       If the RNT is implemented by a hop-by-hop Layer 3 mechanism, using,
       for example, UDP packets (with a specific port number to identify
       notification message type), then the egress label and interface of
       the working path can be used as an index into the inverse cross-
       connect table to obtain the IP addresses of the previous hop(s) and
       the associated outgoing interface(s), as illustrated in Table 3. On
       each hop, the FIS carried in the UDP packet carries the label and
       interface of the working path for that hop. Thus, if the receiving
       node is not a PSL, the label and interface in the FIS can be
       extracted and can be used to access the inverse cross-connect table.
       The label and interface used by the working LSP on the hop(s) to the
       upstream node(s) are then inserted into FIS packet(s), and the FIS
       packet(s) transmitted to the appropriate upstream node(s) along the
       interface specified the inverse cross-connect table. Therefore, in
       the hop-by-hop mechanism the FIS packets are not forwarded by a node
       to its previous hops using its default layer 3 forwarding table.
       Rather, these packets are forwarded via the outgoing interface
       extracted from the nodeÆs inverse cross-connect table. As in the
       example above, in case of a fault on link L[4,6], LSR 3 receives an
       FIS from LSR 4 that contains the outgoing label L34 and the outgoing
       interface I34 of the LSP affected by the fault. LSR3 uses these to
       index its inverse cross-connect table (see Table 3), and learns, as
       before, that there are two previous nodes (those reachable via
       interfaces I23 and I93, respectively) that must receive an FIS. It
       then creates two FIS packets as follows. The first, for transmission
       along interface I23, contains the label L23 used by LSR 2 to
       transmit data to LSR 3 along the working LSP. The second, for
       transmission along interface I93, contains the label L93 used by LSR
       9 to transmit data to LSR 3 along the working LSP.

       The roles of the various core protection/recovery components are:

       PSL: The PSL must be able to correlate the RNT with the working and
       recovery paths. To this end, it maintains a table with a list of
       working LSPs protected by an RNT, and the identity of the recovery
       LSPs that each working path is to be switched to in the event of a

    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 15]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       failure on the working path. It need not maintain an inverse cross-
       connect table (for those LSPs and working paths for which it is the
       PSL).

       PML: The PML, in general, has to remember all of its upstream
       neighbors and associate them with the appropriate working paths and
       RNTs. If the PML is also the root of the RNT, it has to associate
       each of its upstream nodes with a working path and RNT, but it need
       not maintain an inverse cross-connect table (for those LSPs and
       working paths for which it is a PML).

       Intermediate LSR: An intermediate LSR has to only remember all of
       its upstream neighbors and associate them with the appropriate
       working paths and RNTs, and has to maintain an "inverse" cross-
       connect table.

    5.3  Engineering a Protection Domain

       For 1:1 protection, the bandwidth (if any) reserved for a
       protection/recovery path should be the same as the bandwidth
       reserved for its corresponding working path. This guarantees the
       same bandwidth for the protected traffic after protection switching.
       If the LSRs on the protection path support excess mode [3], the
       bandwidth reserved on the protection path for protecting high
       priority traffic can be used by other lower priority traffic
       streams. That is, lower priority traffic that has a segment in
       common with the recovery path, use the bandwidth of the recovery
       path, as long as the recovery path is not called into use. When the
       recovery path is pressed into service, the low priority traffic will
       be discarded to allow for the actual working traffic to take its
       place. Also, if delay, jitter or other QoS parameters are to be
       satisfied, the protection path in 1:1 protection should be chosen
       such that these requirements are satisfied.

       Since the volume of signaling traffic (e.g., FIS/FRS messages, or
       liveness messages) is small, in general bandwidth need not be
       reserved for the signaling traffic provided that there exist other
       mechanisms that can ensure that the delay requirements of signaling
       messages are met (by using, for example, the highest priority for
       signaling messages).

       For bypass tunneling protection, multiple working LSPs may share the
       same protection bandwidth by tunneling protection LSPs over a common
       path. This requires that  the working paths of these LSPs be
       disjoint, except at the PSL and PML, so that they can be assumed to
       not all fail at the same time. In this case, the bandwidth reserved
       on the tunnel will be the maximum of all individual paths.
       Otherwise, a bypass tunnel could be created to carry all the backup
       paths, with the bandwidth reserved for the tunnel being the maximum
       bandwidth required over all failure scenarios on the working LSPs.


       3.4 Configuring Timers


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 16]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       The purpose of timers t1/t1' is to control the tradeoff between
       notification delay of the FIS/FRS and the resources consumed when
       sending the FIS/FRS. If t1/t1' is large, it may take a relatively
       long time for the node that initiated the FIS/FRS transmission to
       send the second the FIS/FRS if the first FIS/FRS message is lost,
       thereby increasing notification delay. On the other hand, if t1/t1'
       is small, the repetitive sending of FIS/FRS messages may waste
       bandwidth and processing power because the first message may already
       have reached the PSL(s).

       It is assumed that after t2/t2' it is not necessary to do protection
       at MPLS layer, either because it is no longer useful or because by
       that time an upper layer protection mechanism will have been
       triggered.

       The timers t4/t4' are used to control the frequency of liveness
       messages sent between neighboring LSRs, so their purpose is the same
       as those of timers t1/t1Æ. While frequent exchanges of liveness
       messages can unnecessarily consume network resources, too few
       exchanges may delay the discovery of faults. To accommodate delay
       jitter, t4' may be set at a slightly different value from t4.

       The timers t5/t6 are used to allow lower layer protection to take
       effect before initiating MPLS layer recovery mechanisms (for
       example, an automatic protection switching between fibers that
       comprise a link between two LSRs). Following the detection of a
       fault/fault repair S/FRS packet, respectively. This allows for the
       lower layer protection to take effect and for the LSR to learn this
       through one of several ways: via an indication from a lower layer,
       or by the resumption of the reception of a liveness message, or by
       the lack of LF, LD, PF or PD conditions (see definitions in [3]).

       The threshold K helps to minimize false alarms due to the occasional
       loss of a liveness message, which may occur, for example, either due
       to a temporary impairment in a link or a peer LSR or due to a buffer
       overflow.

    6.0 Fault Detection

       Each LSR must be able to detect certain types of faults, such as PF,
       PD, LF, and LD [3] and propagate an FIS message towards the PSL.
       Here we consider unidirectional link faults, bi-directional (or
       complete) link faults, and node faults.

       Essentially, the node upstream of the fault must be able to
       detect/learn about the fault. This motivates the need for a
       "liveness" message, which allows a node upstream of the fault to
       detect the fault either directly or implicitly. Also, the fault
       detection mechanism must provide the trigger for generating the FIS.
       Broadly, the types of mechanisms that could be triggers for the FIS
       are:
       i)   Lower layer mechanisms


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 17]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       ii)  MPLS-based detection mechanisms, which may be used to detect
            link faults, via a liveness message for example.
       iii) User-plane OAM mechanisms, such as a path continuity test,
            which may be used to detect other faults, such as mis-
            connections (arising from incorrect entries in the label
            forwarding table, for example).

    6.1 Unidirectional Link Fault

       A uni-directional link fault implies that only one direction of a
       bi-directional link has experienced a fault.

    6.1.2 Downlink Fault

       A fault on a link in the downstream direction will be detected by
       the node downstream of the faulty link, either via the PF or PD
       condition being detected at the MPLS layer, or via LF or LD signals
       being propagated to the MPLS layer by the lower layer or via the
       absence of liveness messages. The downstream node will then
       periodically transmit FIS messages to its upstream neighbor (via the
       uplink), which will propagate these further upstream (using its
       inverse cross-connect table) until they eventually reach the
       appropriate PSLs, which will perform the protection switch.

       Therefore, in Fig. 1, if link L34 has a fault, LSR 4 will detect the
       fault via one of the means described above, and start transmitting
       an FIS packet once every t1 time units back to LSR 3 over link L43.
       The traffic in the queues of LSR 4 will continue to be serviced. LSR
       3 in turn will propagate the FIS over the RNT back to LSR 2 and LSR
       9. The actual protection switch will be performed by LSRs 9 and 1,
       t3 time units after the receipt of the first FIS. LSR 4 will stop
       transmitting FIS messages t2 time units after the transmission of
       the first FIS message.

    6.1.3 Uplink Fault

       A fault on a link in the upstream direction will be detected by a
       node upstream of the faulty link, either via a LF or LD being
       detected at the lower layer and propagated to the MPLS layer (if
       there was traffic on this reverse link), or via the PD or PF
       condition being detected at the MPLS layer, or via absence of
       liveness messages. The upstream node will then periodically send out
       FIS messages to the node upstream of it, which in turn will
       propagate these further until eventually the PSL(s) learns of the
       failure and performs the protection switch.

       Therefore, in Fig. 1, if link L43 experiences a fault, LSR 3 will
       detect the fault, and transmit an FIS to nodes 2 and 9. Node 2, in
       turn, will transmit an FIS to node 1, and nodes 1 and 9 will perform
       the actual protection switch

    6.2 Bi-directional link fault or Node Fault


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 18]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       When both directions of the link have a fault (as in the case of a
       fiber cut), nodes at both ends of the link will detect the fault
       either due to the LF or PF signal or due to the absence of liveness
       messages. Both will transmit FIS messages to their upstream nodes.
       However, it is only the node upstream of the failed link whose FIS
       messages will propagate further upstream, eventually reaching the
       appropriate PSLs, which will perform the protection switch to the
       recovery path.

       The case of a node fault is similar, with the node upstream of the
       failed node detecting the failure (due to loss of liveness messages,
       for example) and propagating that information via the FIS message.

       For example in Fig. 1, when both directions of the link between
       nodes 3 and 4 experience a fault (or when node 4has a fault), LSR 3
       will detect this failure via the non-reception of the liveness
       message, and transmit FIS messages to nodes 2 and 9 as before. When
       nodes 1 and 9 receive the FIS message they will perform the
       protection switch after waiting for an interval of t3 time units.

       The roles of the various core protection components in failure
       detection are the same. The PSL, PML, and intermediate LSR must all
       be able to detect PF and PD conditions and/or be able to interpret
       and respond to the LF and LD indications received from the lower
       layers.

    7.0 Fault Notification

       The rapid notification of a fault is effected by the propagation of
       the FIS message along the RNT. Due to the timers built into the
       FIS/FRS propagation mechanism, the transportation of FIS/FRS
       messages does not require a reliable mechanism like TCP.  Any LSR
       may generate an FIS, but a PSL is the only LSR that may terminate
       it.

       For instance, in Fig. 1 if link L23 fails, LSR 3 will detect it and
       transmit a FIS to LSR 2 (after waiting for time T2), its upstream
       neighbor along link L23. The FIS will contain the incoming labels
       (at node 3) of those LSPs on link L23 that have protection enabled.
       Upon receiving the FIS message, LSR 2 will consult its inverse-cross
       connect table and generate an FIS message for LSR 1, which on
       receiving the first FIS packet will wait for time t3 before
       performing a protection switch. The node which initiates the FIS
       will continue to send FIS messages at an interval of t1 until timer
       t2 expires. After t2 expires it is assumed that either upper layer
       protection will be triggered or enough number of FIS messages will
       have been sent to reach the desired reliability in conveying fault
       information to the PSL(s).

       The roles of the various core protection switching components are:

       PSL: The PSL does not generate a FIS message, but must be able to
       detect FIS packets.


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 19]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000

       PML: The PML must be able to generate the FIS packets in response to
       detecting failure, and should transmit them over the RNT. The PML
       begins FIS transmission after continuously detecting a fault for T2
       time units, and does so every t1 time units for a maximum of t2 time
       units.

       Intermediate LSR: An intermediate LSR must be able to
       generate/forward FIS packets, either as a result of continuously
       detecting a fault for T2 time units or in response to a received FIS
       packet. It must transmit these to all its affected upstream
       neighbors as per its inverse cross-connect table. Again, it does so
       every t1 time units for a maximum of t2 time units.

    8.0 Switch Over

       The switch over is the actual switching of the working traffic from
       the working path to the recovery path. This is performed by a PSL,
       t3 time units after the reception of the first FIS packet.

       For example, in Fig. 1, consider protection domain (1-2-3-4-6-7, 1-
       5-7). When link L34 fails, the PSL LSR 1 on learning of the failure
       will perform a protection switch of the protected traffic from the
       working path 1-2-3-4-6-7 to the backup path 1-5-7. Notice that LSR 7
       acts as a protection merge LSR, merging traffic from the working and
       backup paths. Since buffered packets from LSR 4 may continue to
       arrive at LSR 7 even after the protection switch (the dampening
       timer t43at the PSL tends to mitigate this), a short-term
       misordering of packets may happen at LSR 7, until the buffers on the
       working path drain out.

       The role of the core protection components is as follows:

       PSL: Performs the protection switch upon receipt of the FIS message,
       but after waiting for time t3 following the first FIS message.

       PML: The PML automatically merges protection traffic with working
       traffic. For a short period of time this may cause misordering of
       packets, since packets buffered at LSRs downstream of the fault may
       continue to arrive at the PML along the working path.

       Intermediate LSR: The intermediate LSR has no special action.

    9.0 Switch Back

       Switch back or restoration is the transfer of working traffic from
       the recovery path to the working path, once the working path is
       repaired. This may be because the recovery path may be a limited
       recovery path  [3], or because the working path is deemed to be
       preferred  [3] in some respect. Restoration may be automatic or it
       may be performed by manual intervention (or not performed at all).
       In the revertive mode, restoration is performed upon the receipt of
       the FRS message. A path continuity test may be performed to ensure
       the integrity of the entire path before switching. I n the non-
       revertive mode it may be performed by operator intervention.


    Chang et al.             Expires January 2001                [Page 20]
    IETF Draft   A Path Protection Mechanism for MPLS Networks   July 2000


       The role of the core protection components is similar here to what
       it is for protection switching. The PML does not need to do
       anything, unless it was the node that detected the failure, in which
       case it transmits a FRS upstream T8  time units after continuously
       detecting recover signal from lower layer or after detecting
       liveness messages from its peers. The intermediate LSR generates the
       FRS message if it was the node that detected the recovery or
       generates a FRS to relay the restoration status received from a
       downstream node. The PSL performs the restoration switch t3Æ seconds
       after receiving the first FIS message.
