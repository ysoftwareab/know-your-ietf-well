Abstract 
    
   Billing information protocol is a simple protocol that can be used 
   by servers to indicate the charging information incurred due to a 
   specific operation with a client. In many situations a client, like 
   a SIP user agent may need to know the charging information about a 
   specific interaction with the server.  This document defines the 
   BIP (Billing Information Protocol) that can be used as a standard 
   way to share this charging information.  BIP supports simple 
   indication of charging information.  The protocol defines a generic 
   representation on the number of units charged, the charge incurred 
   per unit etc.  This will be useful for implementing services like 
   advice of charge.  The protocol is targeted for VoIP usages, 
   however any generic client-server interaction can use this 
   protocol.

1.Introduction 
    
   It is a standard requirement, in the deployment of commercial 
   client-server applications, that the server can indicate charging 
   information to the client in some format and method. 
    
   With VoIP applications gaining a lot of popularity this requirement 
   becomes very critical.  For example in the case of SIP[1], the user 
   agents may require to be provided with charging information about 
   the call they have placed.  This may be as a supplementary service 
   like "Advice of Charge" or used for pre-paid card services.  There 
   has to be a standard way by which this information is transferred 
   in the network and interpreted by the client.  This document 
   proposes a protocol, the "billing information protocol (BIP)" that 
   can be used to share this information. 
    
   The motivation for this protocol is the requirement for the "advice 
   of charge" service for SIP[1].  However, this protocol is no way 
   constrained to be used only with SIP [1] or to be only used with

   VoIP applications.  It can be used for data applications with 
   little or no modification and can be carried payload by any 
   suitable protocol. 
     
   This document however does not enumerate all the applications of 
   this protocol, which can be identified in various other drafts for 
   this media type.  This document does not define any accounting 
   procedure by which this data is collected and is only meant to 
   carry charging information between entities.  It also does not 
   describe the units of charging.  There has to be a prior 
   understanding on this between the billing entity and the billed 
   entity. 
    
   The billing information may in most of the conditions be rendered, 
   but other handling may be defined suitably by the applications. 
    
   This protocol information is required to be carried in signalling 
   protocols like SIP or HTTP.  This document identifies SIP [1] as a 
   suitable carrier for this protocol.  Other suitable carriers may 
   also be defined by other documents. 
    
2.Definitions 
    
   The following generic definitions are relevant to this document  
    
      Charging information: the data carried by the protocol 
       
      Information header: Header containing some charging element and 
      its value 
    
      Billing entity: The server or entity that generates the billing 
      information 
       
      Billed entity: The client or entity to which the billing 
      information is sent 
    
   The following telephony related definitions are relevant to this 
   document 
    
      Advice Of Charge: The advice of charge allows the served user to 
      be informed of usage-based charging information. This is the 
      typical application that is the motivation for this protocol. 
       
      Reverse Charging: Where a called user is charged rather than the 
      calling user 
    
       
3.Protocol Operation 
    
 
 
Prasanna                  Expires - May 2003                  [Page 4] 
                  BIP: Billing information Protocol          Dec 2002 
 
 
   The protocolÆs singular purpose is to carry charging related data 
   from the billing entity to the billed entity.  The way the data is 
   created or computed is beyond the scope of the protocol.  Though it 
   is expected that the charging information carried is accurate at 
   that point of time, the validity of the charging information is an 
   agreement between the billing entity and the billed entity. 
    
   The information contains a series of information lines.  Each line 
   contains some part of the charging information.  While the most 
   common handling of the charging information by the billed entity 
   may be displaying it to the user, other operations like terminating 
   a call based on the billing data or request of additional currency 
   from the user in the case of a public phone may be performed. 
    
   This protocol just defines how the data is to be carried, various 
   usages of this protocol has to be enumerated in other documents. 
    
   The protocol uses text based encoding and not binary encodings like 
   CDR, as the common application of this protocol shall be to display 
   the charging information to the user. 
    
   The pieces of information to be carried are grouped into four 
   components. 
    
3.1.Charging Background 
    
   The charging information has to mention the kind of charging done 
   and the kind of information carried by this data.  The charging 
   information generated may be intermediate or final.  Intermediate 
   information is generated where the billed entity is required to be 
   fed with the charge information incrementally or periodically.  The 
   charging information can be final, in which case there shall be no 
   update to the charging information. 
    
   The kind of charging done can be classified as free or normal or 
   reverse.  This mentions why the billed entity is getting this 
   information. 
    
3.2.Charge Data 
    
   This forms the key component of the information.  The actual charge 
   information is conveyed either as units charged or currency 
   charged.  The units are pre-negotiated between the billing entity 
   and the billed entity.  If the currency units are mentioned, then 
   the currency can be qualified. 
    
3.3.Additional Charge Information 
    

 
 
Prasanna                  Expires - May 2003                  [Page 5] 
                  BIP: Billing information Protocol          Dec 2002 
 
 
   To qualify the charging information in a better way some additional 
   information can be provided by the billing entity.  This may be 
   additional services for which the billing entity is charging the 
   billed entity or some indication of the duration for which the 
   billed entity is charged. 
    
3.4.Security 
    
   It is highly desirable that the carrier protocol provides the 
   security for the billing information payload.  However to cater to 
   carriers which do not provide any basic security the protocol has 
   provisions for some basic security.  Since data tampering is the 
   most likely security threat, optionally a cryptographic hash of the 
   information can be carried by the protocol. 
    
   The cryptographic hash can be a MD5 (RFC 1321 [14]) of the complete 
   charging information and a secret key shared by the billing entity 
   and the billed entity. 
    
4.Billing Information Protocol Syntax 
    
      The media type follows the conventions of the SIP (RFC 3261 [1]) 
      for information header formatting.  The billing information 
      contains a series of information headers with each of the 
      information header lines terminated by a CRLF. 
          
         billing-information  =  *info-header 
         info-header    =  "header-name" HCOLON header-value *(COMMA 
      header-value) CRLF 
          
      The basic set of information header fields are defined in this 
      document.  However the information elements can be extended 
      adhering to the generic framework of header format defined 
      above. 
       
         The header field formats strictly adhere to the conventions 
         defined for SIP in section 7.3.1 of  RFC 3261.  Each header 
         field consists of a field name followed by a colon (":") and 
         the field value. 
          
               field-name: field-value 
       
      The definitions of headers are defined in Section 5. 
       
      There is no specific requirement for the order in which the 
      information headers should be present in the charging 
      information. 
       
      The header names and the header values are case sensitive.

5.Header Fields 
    
      This section lists the full set of header fields along with 
      notes on syntax, meaning, and usage.  The ABNF [8] definitions 
      for the headers follow the notations on the basis of section 25 
      of SIP (RFC 3261[1]).   
       
      The conditions for the presence of the header fields in the 
      billing information are summarized in Table 1.  The following 
      codes are used in the table. 
       
            c: Conditional; requirements on the header field depend on 
      other fields in the information. 
       
            m: The header field is mandatory. 
       
            o: The header field is optional.

   Table 1: Presence of headers 
    
5.1.Advice-State 
    
      The advice state header field defines the state of the advice of 
   the charge.  The charging information may be liable to be updated.  
   In this case the state of the advice is termed as ôIntermediateö.  
   But if the billing entity knows there is going to be no further 
   updates on the charging information then the charging information 
   may be termed ôfinal. 
    
   This header field MUST be present one and only once per billing 
   information. 
    
   Advice-State =  "Advice-State" HCOLON Advice-States 
   Advice-State = "final" | "intermediate" 
    
   Example: 
   Advice-State: final

5.2.Charge-Type 
    
   This header field defines the type of the charging information.  
   Though there are many kinds of charging, this document formally 
   defines three of them: normal charging, free call and reverse 
   charging. 
    
   This header MUST be present one and only once per billing 
   information. 
    
      While the first two are used for any application, reverse-
      charging is a typical telephony concept. 
       
   Charge-Type = "Charge-Type" HCOLON Charge-Types 
   Charge-Types = "normal" | "reverse" | "free" | other-type 
   other-type = token 
    
   Example: 
   Charge-Type: normal 
    
    
5.3.Charge-Units 
    
   This field provides the number of charge units incurred.  If the 
   Charging Type is not "free" either this field or Currency Units 
   (section 5.4) MUST be present. 
    
   Charge-Units = "Charge-Units" HCOLON 1*DIGIT["." 1*DIGIT] 
    
   Example: 
   Charge-Units = 12.2 
    
    
5.4.Currency-Units 
    
   This field defines the number of currency units incurred when this 
   charging information was generated.  If the Charging Type is not 
   "free" either this field or Currency Units (section 5.3) MUST be 
   present. 
    
   Currency-Units = "Currency-Units" HCOLON 1*DIGIT["." 1*DIGIT] 
    
   Example: 
   Currency-Units = 1.4

5.5.Currency-ID 
    
   This field defines the currency used for charging.  This normally 
   shall be used in conjunction with the Currency Units.  If this 
   field is absent then the default currency as agreed upon by the 
   billed entity and the billing entity shall be used.  However the 
   mechanisms by which this information is shared is outside the scope 
   of this document. 
    
   Currency-Identifier = "Currency-ID" HCOLON quoted-string 
    
     For certain currencies like "Yuan" or "Yen" the symbol may not be 
     a part of the ASCII definition and may required UTF-8 symbols. 
      
   Example: 
   Currency-ID: "Rs." 
   Currency-ID: "$" 
    
5.6.Duration 
    
   This field defines the number of seconds elapsed in the 
   interaction.  Though this can be computed by the client themselves, 
   this timing information serves as a basis on which the charge 
   information could have been calculated. 
    
   Duration = "Duration" HCOLON 1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT] 
    
   Example: 
   Duration: 140 
    
5.7.Bill-ID 
    
   This field can optionally identify this charging information 
   uniquely.  This field may be required for some applications to 
   identify the charging information generated by the same set of 
   billing entity and billed entity but for different interactions. 
    
   Bill-Identifier = "Bill-ID" HCOLON token [ô@ö token] 
    
    
5.8.Service-Type 
    
   If the billing was done for some special service rendered by the 
   billing entity, the service type can be optionally carried by the 
   charging information.  This document defines a small set of 
   services that can be extended.  All these services are typical 
   telephony services. 
    
   Service-Type = "Service-Type" HCOLON Service-Types

   Service-Types = "cfu" | "cfb" | "cfnr" | "ct" | other-services 
   other-services = token 
    
    
     The meanings of the service types are as follows 
     cfu -  Call Forward Unconditional 
     cfb -  Call Forward Busy 
     cfnr - Call Forward No Resposne 
     ct -   Call Transfer 
    
   Example: 
   Service-Type: cfu 
    
5.9.Hash 
    
   This field can optionally provide a cryptographic hash of the 
   charging information and a secret key shared between the billing 
   entity and billed entity. 
    
      The recommended mechanism is  
         MD5( charging information + ô:ö + Shared Secret Key ) 
    
   Hash = "Hash" HCOLON (32LHEX | token )ö;ö Alg-param 
   Alg-param = ôalgorithmö EQUAL (ômd5ö | token) 
    
   Example: 
   Hash: c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b;algorthim=md5

7.IANA considerations 
 
7.1.The "application/bip" mime type 
    
   This draft registers the "application/bip" MIME media type. 
    
         The advice of charge information is text-based.  It follows 
      the recommendations of RFC 2045[10] for the usage of text-based 
      data for MIME. 
         The information elements and the data filled in the billing 
      information are mostly derived from the ETSI specifications for 
      Advice of Charge ([2], [3], [4]) and the ITU-T specification for 
      the Advice of charge([5]). 
       
         This media type is defined by the following information: 
       
         Media type name: application 
         Media subtype name: bip 
         Required Parameters: None 
         Encoding scheme: ASCII 
         Security considerations: See section 9 
    
    
8.Formal Syntax 
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3]. 
    
   The grammar for this mime-type is mostly derived out of the SIP 
   specification (RFC 3261[1]).  The following definitions are derived 
   from the SIP specification (RFC 3261[1])

9.Security Considerations 
    
   Information carried by the Billing Information Protocol may include 
   sensitive customer information, potentially requiring use of 
   encryption. A charging information should not be trusted until it 
   is ensured that it is received through reliable sources.  Since the 
   charging information is carried by various protocols, security 
   mechanisms defined by these protocols to ensure security and 
   authenticity SHOULD be used. 
    
   As a reference, security mechanisms provided in SIP [1] (section 
   26.1.3) can be used as this is appropriate for both the SIP message 
   and the encapsulated charging information. 
    
   It is preferable to receive the billing information over a secure 
   protocol, like SIP over TLS.  Encryption of the billing-information 
   is also considered a good solution.  Some form of cryptographic 
   hashing on the billing information may be used to ensure there is 
   no tampering of the message en-route.  MD5 (RFC 1321[14]) is a good 
   choice.

   However if the carrier protocol is not providing any security 
   mechanism, a cryptographic hash of the charging information along 
   with a shared key SHOULD be carried as a part of the charging 
   information.
