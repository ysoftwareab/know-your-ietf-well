                   Prospective Architecture for SACM

Abstract

   This document describes the high level architecture for Security
   Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM).  The architecture
   identifies the components that provide for the collection, storage,
   dissemination, and evaluation of posture information.  This
   architecture also describes the interfaces and associated operations
   that define the interactions between these components.  This
   information will inform future engineering work around identifying
   existing standards for collecting, storing, disseminating, and
   evaluating endpoint posture information.  This architecture will also
   help in identifying standardization gaps that require new engineering
   effort.

   Security practitioners need to request, analyze, and aggregate
   posture information from disparate sources that use differing means
   to identify endpoints, hardware, software, and configurations.  This
   task is made harder by the large number of different protocols and
   formats needed to bring together all of this information into a
   single view.  This architecture provides a means to automatically
   gather posture data together for standardized dissemination to
   downstream components.  This allows security practitioners that
   leverage this architecture to focus on managing security problems,
   not data.

1.  Introduction

   This document represents some views of the authors but should not be
   considered to be the opinions of them either individually or
   collectively.  The document is designed both to clarify the thinking
   of the authors as well as to create some discussion on what the
   architecture looks like.  As such, it is entirely reasonable that
   section of the document (i.e. the one on the IM) should be combined,
   removed or replaced.  This can be either because they do not belong
   in this document or because they are just wrong.

   Another aim of the document is to clarify what pieces of the work may
   need to be done in the future as this may help clarify some of the
   dicussions are underway or have been completed.  This is the aim of
   the list of protocols associated with a component.  With this, we can
   perhaps start looking at what DM(s) are doing when they are sending
   data.

   Jim: Part of the questions that would need to be addressed before
   publication is the audience of the document.  It is my personal
   feeling that the document should be sufficently complete that it can
   be handed to a person who is not in the community, and they should be
   able to understand all of the pieces and how they interact.

   To manage information system security risk, network operators must
   know the operational state of the endpoints they manage, and must be
   able to assess known vulnerabilities against this operational state
   to understand potential security risks.  This helps the network
   operator to determine which threats a given endpoint might be subject
   to, and supports decision making around actions that mitigate the
   associated risk.  Vulnerability assessment is an example of this type
   of analysis, where endpoint software inventory is compared with known
   vulnerable software versions reported by software vendors and
   vulnerability researchers to determine which endpoints have
   vulnerable software.  Knowledge of vulnerable software on endpoints
   can then drive software patching activities, reducing the attack
   surface of the network.  Additionally, many organizations develop
   compliance requirements based on their understanding of security
   risks.  These compliance requirements, also called policies, define
   what software may be installed on a given endpoint and how that
   software must be configured to achieve a sufficient level of security
   risk reduction for the organization.  In both cases, an organization
   needs to have an up-to-date view of the operational state of the
   endpoints connected to their networks and accessing their information
   systems.

   Understanding the operational state of an endpoint (hereafter
   referred to as "endpoint posture") requires the ability to collect
   and evaluate endpoint posture information as posture changes occur.
   In order to make decisions quickly to prevent, deflect, or mitigate
   an attack, network operators must be able to collect, disseminate,
   and evaluate posture information within narrow timeframes.  Making
   decisions quickly relies on automating posture collection and
   evaluation processes so that network operators can identify
   endpoints, software, and software configurations in a meaningful and
   enduring way that is suitable for trending and longer-term analysis.
   This document describes a suitable architecture that supports
   automated collection, storage, dissemination, and evaluation of
   endpoint posture information.

   Still needs text dealing with other uses.

   There is an IM and a DM.  Some differences between these are found in
   [RFC3444].

2.  SACM Components

   The SACM architecture is made up of a number of different entities
   each of which supports one or more roles.  A picture of what roles
   can exist can be found in Figure 1.

   A description of the different roles in the picture above is as
   follows:

   Authenticator:  is a role that provides authentication services for
      other entities within the architecture.  Entities can interact
      with an authenticator once and be provided with a long term
      credential, such as a certificate, or can be interacted with
      whenever authentiction is needed, such as an EAP server.  Even
      when interacting on a frequent basis, a short term credential such
      as a SAML assertion can be provided.  Interactions with an
      authenticator include:

Internet-Draft      Prospective Architecture for SACM       October 2016


      *  Enrollment: The act of being introduced to the authentication
         system.

      *  Revocation: The act of being removed from the authentication
         system.

      *  Authentication: The act of proving an identity to the
         authentication system matches one that was introduced to it.

   Authorizer:  is a role that provides authorization and access control
      to data and capabilities for an entity within the architecture.
      Frequently, but not always authorizers and authenticators will be
      co-located and administered.  Interactions with an authorizer
      include:

      *  Authorization: An administrative act of adding authorizations
         for an identity.

      *  Revocation: An administrative act of removing authorizations
         for an identity.

      *  Querying: The act of asking if an identity is authorized for
         performing an action or receiving data.

   Directory:  is a role that provides methods to locate where services
      and data can be found in the architecture.  Interactions with a
      directory include:

      *  Publishing: The act of telling a directory what services or
         data can an entity provides.

      *  Unpublishing: The act of removing from a directory a list of
         services or data that an entity provides.

      *  Querying: The act of asking a directory where a service or set
         of data can be found.

      *  Directory Location: The act of finding a directory in the first
         place.

   Data Store:  is a role that provides a repository for data to be
      published into and queried from.  Interactions with a data store
      include:

      *  Publishing: The act of providing data to a data store.

      *  Querying: The act of obtaining data from a data store.

Internet-Draft      Prospective Architecture for SACM       October 2016


      *  Synchronization: The act of two data stores making the data
         they hold consistent.

   SACM Collector:  is a role that obtains data and then publishes it
      into the SACM environment.  A SACM collect will either publish the
      data to a data store, or act as a data store itself.  SACM
      collectors can location and publish data either in response to a
      query, if they act as a data store, on a schedule, or in response
      to some event.  A SACM collector will format data provided to it
      into the SACM Information model, decorating it as necessary, and
      then provide it to the rest of the environment.

   Raw Data Collector:  is a role that is ancillary to the SACM
      architecture rather than being a core component.  Raw data
      collectors gather data which is fed to a SACM collector.  Examples
      of raw data collectors could be NEA components, asset management
      databases (hardware, software or wetware), or network state
      databases such as a DHCP server.

   Aggregator:  is a role that looks at data in the SACM environment,
      combines together pieces of related data and publishes the new
      relationships back into the environment.  An example of what an
      aggregator might do is to look at the information provided by a
      DHCP server along with historic IP address information for a
      machine to determine when records referring to a machine are the
      same one or different ones.

   Evaluator:  is a role that looks a the data in the SACM environment
      along with a set of evaluation criteria, compares the data with
      the criteria and publishes the results of the evaluation back into
      the environment.  Evaluators can look at things as simple as are
      all of the pieces of software on a machine licensed to as
      complicated as comparing data for a network or machine against an
      intrusion report.

   SACM Proxy:  is a role that allows for data to be transfered between
      two different SACM environments.  SACM proxies frequently provide
      the data store role as well so that they can know what data needs
      to be synchronized between the two subsystems.  SACM proxies can
      exist in environments where they are always active, or where only
      intermittent connectivity exists between the two subsystems.

   Policy Management:  is a role that controls different policy
      configurations for the environment.  This includes such things as:
      What to report and who to report it to.  Conditions under which
      automated remediation should automatically be applied.  What the
      priorities are used in performing evaluations and frequencies of
      evaluations.

Internet-Draft      Prospective Architecture for SACM       October 2016


   External Event:  is a role that acts between the SACM environment and
      external non-SACM systems.  One type of interaction that would be
      covered here is dealing with external vulnerability reports.  As
      reports come from external sources, they need to be messaged into
      the correct format for storage in the SACM IM and then supplied to
      evaluators to identify if the vulnerability exists in systems SACM
      monitors.  The same thing can happen in reverse, where
      vulnerabilities or conditions that look like they might be
      vulnerabilities could be reported to an external centeralized
      authority.

   In many cases it is not always clear where a single service falls.  A
   simple example of this is where the NEA protocol would fit into the
   picture.  NEA can be treated either as an internal collector or as an
   external collector depending on what is being collected and how the
   observer feels about the world.  Many of the core things that NEA
   collects today are not directly mapped to the SACM Information Model
   without some massaging, as such it is reasonable to look at this as
   being an external collector with the NEA server being co-resident
   with the SACM External Collector.  This entity would take the NEA
   data, convert it into the SACM IM, and then publish it using one of
   the SACM DMs.  On the other hand, it is also possible that NEA would
   collect data that corresponds directly to a SACM IM and return the
   data already encoded in a SACM DM.  In this case, it would make sense
   to consider the NEA client as being a SACM Internal collector which
   publishes using NEA as the publishing protocol and the ENA server
   being either a proxy or a data store.

2.1.  Combining Roles

   In many cases more than one role will be combined into a single
   entity.  In this section a view of how roles might be combined
   together to provide support as a proxy for the Ice Station Zebra use
   case in [RFC7632].  In this scenario, the enterprise has two
   different SACM sub-systems.  One sub-system is at the main enterprise
   and the other sub-system is at Zebra.  There is not a constant high-
   speed connection between the two sub-systems, instead data is
   exchanged an intermittent, low-speed, high-latency link.

   The proxy role is the one that sits between the two subsystems, that
   is what it is designed for.  Due to the link, one would have two
   different proxies one on either side of the link.  The entity that
   contains the proxy may additionally have the following roles:

   o  Data Store: Placing a data store on the proxy allows for queries
      about devices on the other size to be queued up and synchronized
      across the connection.  Additionally, having a data store for
      those items on the opposite side of the link allows that data



Schaad & Waltermire        Expires May 4, 2017                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Prospective Architecture for SACM       October 2016


      store to specialize on how to optimally synchronize data across
      the link.

   o  Directory Service: Placing a directory service that tells about
      the systems and services on opposite side of the connection allows
      for the ability to filter down the set of registrations that are
      passed over the link.

   o  Authorization Service: The authorizations may be changed for some
      entities based on the location of the service they are asking
      about.  A user may have basically unlimited authorization for the
      local subsystem, but may have limited authorization for the remove
      subsystem.  This rule would apply whether they were at the home
      base or at Zebra.

2.2.  SACM Collection

   The collection of data in the SACM world is one of the major issues
   that needs to be dealt with.  For this reason we drill down into that
   problem here.

   When dealing with just the issue of collcition, the SACM architecture
   can be thought of as having a left-hand side and a right-hand side,
   illustrated by the dotted line in Figure 2.  The left-hand side
   describes how management protocols can be used to allow a Collection
   Controller (CC) to choreograph the collection of endpoint posture
   from a set of target endpoints through posture change subscriptions
   or direct requests, and for endpoints to report posture information
   based on these collection requests.  The left-hand side of the
   architecture is built upon existing endpoint management protocols;
   however, new protocols are needed to separate out the evaluation and
   collection capabilities defined by some of these protocols (e.g.,
   NEA).

                        Figure 2: SACM Architecture

   At the center of the SACM architecture is a CC that spans the left-
   and right-hand sides.  The CC choreographs the collection of posture
   information on the left-hand side, and provides a common view of the
   collected posture for the right-hand side.  Working in this way, all
   Evaluators that consume posture information from a given CC are
   provided a common view of all endpoint posture information collected
   by the CC.  This common view can be accessed by Evaluators who need
   this information for asset management, configuration management, and
   vulnerability management use cases, and collected posture information
   can also be made available to other posture consumers to support
   unforeseen use cases.

   The right-hand side of the SACM architecture defines how posture
   information is shared between components that provide collected
   posture (e.g., a Collection Controller) and components that store,
   evaluate, and use collected posture information on the network.
   Analytical and reporting capabilities need to be able to publish and

   subscribe to posture data feeds from other tools that have the
   required information.  Other capabilities may need to access data
   stores of previously collected, historic posture information.  By
   separating the methods of posture collection from how this
   information is consumed for use, the SACM architecture protects
   endpoints from being overloaded by downstream requests, and posture
   data from unauthorized access.  These benefits support security
   automation by providing improved access to posture information by
   downstream consumers, and allowing downstream components to
   communicate information derived from posture analysis.

   The following subsection discuss the motivations for the SACM
   architecture.

2.2.1.  Use of Existing Management Protocols

   On the left-hand side of the SACM architecture, a number of existing,
   widely deployed endpoint management protocols support the collection
   of posture information from endpoints.  Examples of these protocols
   include: the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3411],
   Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC4741], and the Network
   Endpoint Assessment (NEA) protocol [RFC5209].  These and similar
   protocols provide extension points that allow for new types of
   posture information to be represented and collected over time.  For
   these reasons, integration with existing posture collection protocols
   is a key feature of this architecture.

   A gap in the functionality provided by existing protocols is a
   generalized mechanism to allow external components to drive data
   collection activities through a common, protocol agnostic collection
   interface.  This is a feature supported by the SACM architecture
   through the definition of a common interface on the right-hand side
   that allows the CC to choreograph posture collection through
   implementations of existing management protocols on the left-hand
   side.

2.2.2.  The Need for Collection Choreography

   Collection choreography is the act of managing posture collection
   activities on the left-hand side to produce a common view of
   collected posture information for one or more collection consumers on
   the right-hand side.  Collection choreography is supported in the
   SACM architecture by the Collection Controller (CC) for the following
   reasons:

   Simplification of Collection Clients  Multiple management protocols
         are needed to fullfil posture information collection requests
         across different types of endpoints.  To provide coverage of

         all posture information that may need to be collected, any
         component driving posture collection must be well versed in
         multiple protocols and associated data models.  Developing and
         maintaining this level of protocol support is a heavy burden to
         place on Evaluators.  Additionally, some management solutions
         make use of specialized collection managers or proxies (e.g.,
         mobile device management) that directly communicate with the
         target endpoint(s) on behalf of requesting clients.  Requiring
         evaluators to locate and communicate with these proxies would
         discourage development and adoption of SACM solutions.  The
         SACM architecture reduces the implementation burden on
         Evaluators by making the CC manage which collection services a
         request should be sent to when satisfying a given SACM
         collection request.  This allows Evaluators to focus only on
         identifying and processing the data they request, and not on
         managing the collection process.

   Authenticating, Authorizing, and Controlling Access of Data
   Collection Consumers
            An automated collection system can pose a significant risk
            to an organization if the system can be misused by an
            attacker to gain knowledge of the operational state of
            endpoints.  Once accessed by an attacker, this information
            can be used to attack other hosts or move laterally within a
            network.  For this reason, access to collected endpoint
            posture information must be restricted to authenticated and
            authorized entities.  Different management protocols may
            employ different authentication and authorization schemes.
            Through the use of a shared CC, access can be controlled in
            a way that unifies the underlying authentication,
            authorization, and access control schemes.

      Reducing Performance Impacts on the Target Endpoint  Without a
            common CC, Evaluators would need to directly interact with
            an endpoint to request posture data.  Multiple clients
            operating in this way might request the same posture data
            within a narrow time window, resulting in multiple
            collection operations that can reduce the operational
            performance of the endpoint.  Use of a CC can allow these
            repetitive and duplicative collection operations to be
            optimized.  Working in this way, the CC can compute an
            optimal collection approach, using the appropriate
            management protocols to efficiently collect any needed
            posture data.  This data can be cached by the CC, operating
            as a Data Store, and can be reused within an appropriate
            time window to provide multiple clients with the same
            collected posture information.

   For these reasons a Collection Controller is needed to choreograph
   posture collection within the SACM architecture.

2.2.3.  Collected Information Dissemination

   On the right-hand side of the SACM architecture, once collection has
   been triggered and choreographed, there remains the issue of
   efficiently disseminating the collected posture information to
   consumers.  The collection activity will have yielded information in
   an arbitrary data format, often spread across several formats with
   overlapping and mismatched information.  There is a need for a means
   to package this information in a standardized way such that automated
   systems downstream can consume it without a priori knowledge of the
   source format.

   The SACM architecture needs to support direct request response and
   publish subscribe mechanisms for posture data dissemination.  In
   either case, arbitrary data formats can be processed at collection
   time and re-enveloped by a standardized information description.  The
   downstream consumer needs to only understand the enveloping model to
   process the message containing posture information.  It might also be
   possible to allow the enveloping model to identify multiple formats,
   allowing the consumer to request information from the designated
   source in a specific format it recognizes and supports.

3.  SACM Protocols

   List of protocols:

   Authentication:  A method of doing an entity to authenticate itself
      is required.  Several potential candidates exist for this purpose.
      Among these candidates are X.509 certificates, SAML assertions,
      EAP or GSS-API.

   Authorization:  A standardized method of either querying the
      authorization server or carrying authorization information needs
      to be selected.  Some of the candidates for this would be SAML
      assertions or X.509 attribute certificates.

   Query:  There will exist a standardized method for querying data from
      a repository.  The query protocal needs to do the following
      things:

         Get the required authentication for the quester.  The server
         needs to authenticate both that the requester has the needed
         rights both to make the query and to have access to the data
         involved.

Internet-Draft      Prospective Architecture for SACM       October 2016


         The entities need to negotiate a data model to be used for the
         creation of the query and to express the query in.

         The entities need to negotiate a data model, a serialization
         abstraction and a serialization data format for data to be
         returned in response to a query.

         The ability to specify required meta-data as part of the query
         is a requirement.  As an example, the ability to require that
         the data be collected after a given date and time is required.

         The ability to negotiate the frequency that the data is to be
         returned to the client.  Data may be required as a one time
         event or as an ongoing event.  One time events may be returned
         either immediately, or when the query can be completed as the
         data becomes available.  Ongoing responses can be based on a
         time interval or based on some event happening.  For ongoing
         response, the criteria for specify the frequency of response
         needs to be both negotiated and authorized.

   Response:  There will exist a standardized method for sending data
      from a server to a client.  Data may be sent to a client based
      either on a request for data, a prior request for data or because
      the server decided the client needs the data.  Servers need to do
      the authentication and authorization on the data to be returned at
      a regular basis.

   Directory Register:  There will exist a standardized method for
      registering and unregistering data in a directory service.

   Directory Query:  There will exist a standardized method for querying
      the directory service for supported services.

   Publish:  There will exist a standardized method for publishing data
      into a repository.  The method will:

      *  Verify the identity and authorization of the publisher.

      *  If needed, negotiate the format in which the data is presented.
         This includes the data model, data abstraction and data
         serialization.

      *  Verify that the required meta-data that the publisher must
         provide is present.

      *  Provide repository based meta-data.

Internet-Draft      Prospective Architecture for SACM       October 2016


      Additionally, the repository will potentially trigger events
      within the server for dealing with outstanding requests for data
      or evaluations.

   Synchronization:  There will exist a standardized method for doing
      synchronization between multiple data stores.  This method will:

      *  TBD.

   Collection:  Many different protocols can be used to do collection
      over.  One of these is NEA [RFC5209] which acts as a transport for
      serializations of SACM data models.  The use of NEA as the
      transport satisifes the following requirements:

      *  NEA requires the use of TLS [TLS??] for cryptographic
         protection between the client and the server.

      *  NEA has defined two authentication protocols to run between the
         client and the server.  These are PT-TLS [RFC6876] and PT-EAP
         [RFC7171].  PT-TLS uses X.509 certificates on both the client
         and server side to authenticate each side.  PT-EAP allows for
         EAP [RFC3748] to be used which allows for lighter weight
         registration and authentication to occur.

      *  Authorization is currently of the all or none variety.
         Authorization is done at configuration time.

      *  Discovery is not currently supported by NEA, so the server
         location is configured onto the client.

      to carry SACM information.

4.  Information Model

   The SACM architecture includes a single Information Model to provide
   a consistent view of the data needed to do perform the endpoint
   posture assessment.  Additional IMs may be defined by entities other
   than the IETF which are supersets of the IETF IM.  This is one way
   that companies will be able to differentiate their products from each
   other.  The IM includes not only the data itself, but metadata as
   well.  The meta data includes, but is not limited to:

   o  Who collected or created the data

   o  When the data was collected or created

   o  What data was used to create the data

Internet-Draft      Prospective Architecture for SACM       October 2016


   o  What relationships exist between different data points or
      different versions of the same data point.

5.  Data Model

   The SACM architecture includes a single Data Model defined by the
   IETF.  Additional DMs maybe defined by entities other than the IETF.
   These additional DMs may be either subsets or supersets of the IETF
   SACM DM.  The subset DMs are defined for doing special purpose work
   which does not need the full SACM DM.

   The term DM is used by the SACM group in two different contexts and
   it is useful to discuss those two contexts.  Data Model can refer to
   how the data is arranged within a entity.  In this view of a DM, one
   can use a relational database as the conceptual view of the world.
   The relations in the database reflect the relations between the data
   in the IM.  The use of a relational database is not the only way to
   implement the DM within a process.

   The term DM can also refer to how the data is represented when
   serialized for transport between two entities.  This is the meaning
   that is more usual when looking at the current SACM documents.  This
   is sometimes referred to as the DM in transit.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document is a high level description of the architecture of the
   SACM environment, as such it does not directly specify any security
   problems or requirements.  Security requirements for SACM can be
   found in other documents including the SACM Requirements
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements].
