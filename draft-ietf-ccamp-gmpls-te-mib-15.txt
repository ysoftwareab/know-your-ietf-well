1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] based
   traffic engineering. The tables and objects defined in this document
   extend those defined in the equivalent document for MPLS traffic
   engineering [RFC3812], and management of GMPLS traffic engineering is
   built on management of MPLS traffic engineering.

   The MIB modules in this document should be used in conjunction with
   the companion document [GMPLSLSRMIB] for GMPLS based traffic
   engineering configuration and management.

   Comments should be made direct to the CCAMP mailing list at
   ccamp@ops.ietf.org.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119,

   reference [RFC2119].

1.1. Migration Strategy

   MPLS-TE LSPs may be modeled and managed using the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB
   module [RFC3812].

   LSRs may be migrated to model and manage their TE LSPs using the MIB
   modules in this document in order to migrate the LSRs to GMPLS
   support, or to take advandtage of additional MIB objects defined in
   these MIB modules that are applicable to MPLS-TE.

   The GMPLS TE MIB module (GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB) defined in this document
   extends the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB module [RFC3812] through a series of
   augmentations and sparse augmentations of the MIB tables. The only
   additions are for support of GMPLS or to support the increased
   complexity of MPLS and GMPLS systems.

   In order to migrate from MPLS-TE-STD-MIB support to GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB
   support an implementation needs only to add support for the
   additional tables and objects defined in GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB. The
   gmplsTunnelLSPEncoding may be set to tunnelLspNotGmpls to allow an
   MPLS-TE LSP tunnel to benefit from the additional objects and tables
   of GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB without supporting the GMPLS protocols.

   The companion document for modeling and managing GMPLS based LSRs
   [GMPLSLSRMIB] extends the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB module [RFC3813] with the
   same intentions.

   Textual conventions are defined in [RFC3811] and the
   IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB MIB module.

2. Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the MPLS architecture document
   [RFC3031], from the GMPLS architecture document [RFC3945], and from
   the MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB [RFC3812]. Some frequently used
   terms are described next.

   An explicitly routed LSP (ERLSP) is referred to as a GMPLS tunnel. It
   consists of in-segment(s) and/or out-segment(s) at the egress/ingress
   LSRs, each segment being associated with one GMPLS enabled interface.
   These are also referred to as tunnel segments.

   Additionally, at an intermediate LSR, we model a connection as
   consisting of one or more in-segments and/or one or more
   out-segments. The binding or interconnection between in-segments and
   out-segments in performed using a cross-connect.

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006




   These segment and cross-connect objects are defined in the MPLS Label
   Switch Router MIB (MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB) [RFC3813], but see also the
   GMPLS Label Switching Router MIB (GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB) [GMPLSLSRMIB] 
   for the GMPLS-specific extensions to these objects.

3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4. Outline

   Support for GMPLS traffic-engineered tunnels requires the following
   configuration.

   - Setting up tunnels with appropriate MPLS configuration parameters
     using [RFC3812].
   - Extending the tunnels with GMPLS configuration parameters.
   - Configuring tunnel loose and strict source routed hops.

   These actions may need to be accompanied with corresponding actions
   using [RFC3813] and [GMPLSLSRMIB] to establish and configure tunnel
   segments, if this is done manually. Also, the in-segment and
   out-segment performance tables, mplsInSegmentPerfTable and
   mplsOutSegmentPerfTable [RFC3813], should be used to determine
   performance of the tunnels and tunnel segments although it should be
   noted that those tables may not be appropriate for measuring
   performance on some types of GMPLS links.

4.1. Summary of GMPLS Traffic Engineering MIB Module

   The following tables contain MIB objects for performing the actions
   listed above when they cannot be performed solely using MIB objects
   defined in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812].

   - Tunnel Table (gmplsTunnelTable) for providing GMPLS-specific
     tunnel configuration parameters.



Nadeau and Farrel            Expires October 2006            [Page 4]

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006




   - Tunnel specified, actual, and computed hop tables
     (gmplsTunnelHopTable, gmplsTunnelARHopTable, and
     gmplsTunnelCHopTable) for providing additional configuration of
     strict and loose source routed tunnel hops.
   - Performance and error reporting tables (gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable
     and gmplsTunnelErrorTable).

   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.

   Additionally, the GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB module contains a new
   notification.

   - The GMPLS Tunnel Down Notification (gmplsTunnelDown) should be used
     for all GMPLS tunnels in place of the mplsTunnelDown notification
     defined in [RFC3812]. An implementation must not issue both the
     gmplsTunnelDown and the mplsTunnelDown notifications for the same
     event. As well as indicating that a tunnel has transitioned to
     operational down state, this new notification indicates the cause
     of the failure.

5. Brief Description of GMPLS TE MIB Objects

   The objects described in this section support the functionality
   described in [RFC3473] and [RFC3472] for GMPLS tunnels. The tables
   support both manually configured and signaled tunnels.

5.1. gmplsTunnelTable

   The gmplsTunnelTable extends the MPLS traffic engineering MIB module
   (MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812]) to allow GMPLS tunnels to be created
   between an LSR and a remote endpoint, and existing GMPLS tunnels to
   be reconfigured or removed.

   Note that we only support point-to-point tunnel segments, although
   multi-point-to-point and point-to-multi-point connections are
   supported by an LSR acting as a cross-connect.

   Each tunnel can thus have one out-segment originating at an LSR
   and/or one in-segment terminating at that LSR.

   Three objects within this table utilize enumerations in order to map
   to enumerations that are used in GMPLS signaling. In order to protect
   the GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB module from changes (in particular, extensions)
   to the range of enumerations supported by the signaling protocols,
   these MIB objects use Textual Conventions with values maintained by
   IANA. For further details, see the IANA Considerations section of
   this document.

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006




5.2. gmplsTunnelHopTable

   The gmplsTunnelHopTable is used to indicate additional parameters for
   the hops, strict or loose, of a GMPLS tunnel defined in
   gmplsTunnelTable, when it is established using signaling. Multiple
   tunnels may share hops by pointing to the same entry in this table.

5.3. gmplsTunnelARHopTable

   The gmplsTunnelARHopTable is used to indicate the actual hops
   traversed by a tunnel as reported by the signaling protocol after the
   tunnel is setup. The support of this table is optional since not all
   GMPLS signaling protocols support this feature.

5.4. gmplsTunnelCHopTable

   The gmplsTunnelCHopTable lists the actual hops computed by a
   constraint-based routing algorithm based on the gmplsTunnelHopTable.
   The support of this table is optional since not all implementations
   support computation of hop lists using a constraint-based routing
   protocol.

5.5. gmplsTunnelErrorTable

   The gmplsTunnelErrorTable provides access to information about the
   last error that occurred on each tunnel known about by the MIB. It
   indicates the nature of the error, when and how it was reported and
   can give recovery advice through an admin string.

5.6. gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable

   gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable provides additional counters to measure
   the performance of bidirectional GMPLS tunnels in which packets are
   visible. It supplements the counters in mplsTunnelPerfTable and
   augments gmplsTunnelTable.

   Note that not all counters may be appropriate or available for some
   types of tunnel.

5.7.  Use of 32-bit and 64-bit Counters

   64-bit counters are provided in the GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB module for
   high-speed interfaces where the use of 32-bit counters might be
   impractical. The requirements on the use of 32-bit and 64-bit
   counters (copied verbatim from [RFC2863]) are as follows:

   For interfaces that operate at 20,000,000 (20 million) bits per



Nadeau and Farrel            Expires October 2006            [Page 6]

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006



   second or less, 32-bit byte and packet counters MUST be supported.
   For interfaces that operate faster than 20,000,000 bits/second, and
   slower than 650,000,000 bits/second, 32-bit packet counters MUST be
   supported and 64-bit octet counters MUST be supported.  For
   interfaces that operate at 650,000,000 bits/second or faster, 64-bit
   packet counters AND 64-bit octet counters MUST be supported.

6. Cross-referencing to the gmplsLabelTable

   The gmplsLabelTable is found in the GMPLS-LABEL-STD-MIB module in
   [GMPLSLSRMIB] and provides a way to model labels in a GMPLS system
   where labels might not be simple 32 bit integers.

   The hop tables in this document (gmplsTunnelHopTable, 
   gmplsTunnelCHopTable and gmplsTunnelARHopTable) and the segment 
   tables in the [RFC3813] (mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable) 
   contain objects with syntax MplsLabel.

   MplsLabel (defined in [RFC3811]) is a 32-bit integer that is capable
   of representing any MPLS label and most GMPLS labels. However, some
   GMPLS labels are larger than 32 bits and may be of arbitrary length.
   Further, some labels that may be safely encoded in 32 bits are
   constructed from multiple sub-fields. Additionally, some GMPLS
   technologies support the concatenation of individual labels to
   represent a data flow carried as multiple sub-flows.

   These GMPLS cases require that something other than a simple 32-bit
   integer is made available to represent the labels. This is achieved
   through the gmplsLabelTable contained in the GMPLS-LABEL-STD-MIB
   [GMPLSLSRMIB].

   The tables in this document and [RFC3813] that include objects with
   syntax MplsLabel also include companion objects that are row
   pointers. If the row pointer is set to zeroDotZero (0.0) then object
   of syntax MplsLabel contains the label encoded as a 32-bit integer.
   But otherwise the row pointer indicates a row in another MIB table
   that includes the label. In these cases, the row pointer may indicate
   a row in the gmplsLabelTable.

   This provides both a good way to support legacy systems that
   implement the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812], and a significant
   simplification in GMPLS systems that are limited to a single, simple
   label type.

   Note that gmplsLabelTable supports concatenated labels through the
   use of a label sub-index (gmplsLabelSubindex).

7. Example of GMPLS Tunnel Setup

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006




   This section contains an example of which MIB objects should be
   modified to create a GMPLS tunnel. This example shows a best effort,
   loosely routed, bidirectional traffic engineered tunnel, which spans
   two hops of a simple network, uses Generalized Label requests with
   Lambda encoding, has label recording and shared link layer
   protection. Note that these objects should be created on the
   "head-end" LSR.

   First in the mplsTunnelTable:

   {
     mplsTunnelIndex                = 1,
     mplsTunnelInstance             = 1,
     mplsTunnelIngressLSRId         = 192.0.2.1,
     mplsTunnelEgressLSRId          = 192.0.2.2,
     mplsTunnelName                 = "My first tunnel",
     mplsTunnelDescr                = "Here to there and back again",
     mplsTunnelIsIf                 = true (1),
     mplsTunnelXCPointer            = mplsXCIndex.3.0.0.12,
     mplsTunnelSignallingProto      = none (1),
     mplsTunnelSetupPrio            = 0,
     mplsTunnelHoldingPrio          = 0,
     mplsTunnelSessionAttributes    = recordRoute (4),
     mplsTunnelOwner                = snmp (2),
     mplsTunnelLocalProtectInUse    = false (2),
     mplsTunnelResourcePointer      = mplsTunnelResourceIndex.6,
     mplsTunnelInstancePriority     = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopTableIndex        = 1,
     mplsTunnelPrimaryInstance      = 0,
     mplsTunnelIncludeAnyAffinity   = 0,
     mplsTunnelIncludeAllAffinity   = 0,
     mplsTunnelExcludeAnyAffinity   = 0,
     mplsTunnelPathInUse            = 1,
     mplsTunnelRole                 = head(1),
     mplsTunnelRowStatus            = createAndWait (5),
   }

   In gmplsTunnelTable(1,1,192.0.2.1,192.0.2.2):
   {
     gmplsTunnelUnnumIf             = true (1),
     gmplsTunnelAttributes          = labelRecordingRequired (1),
     gmplsTunnelLSPEncoding         = tunnelLspLambda,
     gmplsTunnelSwitchingType       = lsc,
     gmplsTunnelLinkProtection      = shared (2),
     gmplsTunnelGPid                = lambda,
     gmplsTunnelSecondary           = false (2),
     gmplsTunnelDirection           = bidirectional (1)

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006



     gmplsTunnelPathComp            = explicit(2),
     gmplsTunnelSendPathNotifyRecipientType = ipv4(1),
     gmplsTunnelSendPathNotifyRecipient     = 'C0000201'H,
     gmplsTunnelAdminStatusFlags    = 0,
     gmplsTunnelExtraParamsPtr      = 0.0
   }

   Entries in the mplsTunnelResourceTable, mplsTunnelHopTable and
   gmplsTunnelHopTable are created and activated at this time.

   In mplsTunnelResourceTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelResourceIndex        = 6,
     mplsTunnelResourceMaxRate      = 0,
     mplsTunnelResourceMeanRate     = 0,
     mplsTunnelResourceMaxBurstSize = 0,
     mplsTunnelResourceRowStatus    = createAndGo (4)
   }

   The next two instances of mplsTunnelHopEntry are used to denote the
   hops this tunnel will take across the network.

   The following denotes the beginning of the network, or the first hop.
   We have used the fictitious LSR identified by "192.0.2.1" as our
   example head-end router.

   In mplsTunnelHopTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelHopListIndex         = 1,
     mplsTunnelPathOptionIndex      = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopIndex             = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopAddrType          = ipV4 (1),
     mplsTunnelHopIpv4Addr          = 192.0.2.1,
     mplsTunnelHopIpv4PrefixLen     = 9,
     mplsTunnelHopType              = strict (1),
     mplsTunnelHopRowStatus         = createAndWait (5),
   }

   The following denotes the end of the network, or the last hop in our
   example. We have used the fictitious LSR identified by
   "192.0.2.2" as our tail end router.

   In mplsTunnelHopTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelHopListIndex         = 1,
     mplsTunnelPathOptionIndex      = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopIndex             = 2,
     mplsTunnelHopAddrType          = ipV4 (1),

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006



     mplsTunnelHopIpv4Addr          = 192.0.2.2,
     mplsTunnelHopIpv4PrefixLen     = 9,
     mplsTunnelHopType              = loose (2),
     mplsTunnelHopRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)
   }

   Now an associated entry in the gmplsTunnelHopTable is created to
   provide additional GMPLS hop configuration indicating that the first
   hop is an unnumbered link using explicit forward and reverse labels.

   An entry in the gmplsLabelTable is created first to include the
   explicit label.

   In gmplsLabelTable:
   {
     gmplsLabelInterface            = 2,
     gmplsLabelIndex                = 1,
     gmplsLabelSubindex             = 0,
     gmplsLabelType                 = gmplsFreeformLabel(3),
     gmplsLabelFreeform             = 0xFEDCBA9876543210
     gmplsLabelRowStatus            = createAndGo(4)
   }

   In gmplsTunnelHopTable(1,1,1):
   {
     gmplsTunnelHopLabelStatuses           = forwardPresent(0)
                                                +reversePresent(1),
     gmplsTunnelHopExplicitForwardLabelPtr = gmplsLabelTable (2, 1, 0)
     gmplsTunnelHopExplicitReverseLabelPtr = gmplsLabelTable (2, 1, 0)
   }

   The first hop is now activated:

   In mplsTunnelHopTable(1,1,1):
   {
     mplsTunnelHopRowStatus         = active (1)
   }

   No gmplsTunnelHopEntry is created for the second hop as it contains
   no special GMPLS features.

   Finally the mplsTunnelEntry is activated:

   In mplsTunnelTable(1,1,192.0.2.1,192.0.2.2)
   {
     mplsTunnelRowStatus            = active(1)

        an LSR and a remote endpoint, and existing tunnels to be
        reconfigured or removed.

        Note that only point-to-point tunnel segments are supported,
        although multi-point-to-point and point-to-multi-point
        connections are supported by an LSR acting as a cross-connect.
        Each tunnel can thus have one out-segment originating at this
        LSR and/or one in-segment terminating at this LSR.

        The row status of an entry in this table is controlled by
        mplsTunnelRowStatus in the corresponding entry in
        mplsTunnelTable. When the corresponding mplsTunnelRowStatus has
        value active(1) a row in this table may not be created or
        modified.

        The exception to this rule is the
        gmplsTunnelAdminStatusInformation object, which can be modified
        whilst the tunnel is active."

9. Security Considerations

   It is clear that the MIB modules described in this document in
   association with the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] are potentially useful
   for monitoring of MPLS and GMPLS tunnels. These MIB modules can also
   be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that can
   be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially
   disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB modules
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the gmplsTunnelTable and gmplsTunnelHopTable collectively contain
      objects to provision GMPLS tunnels interfaces at their ingress
      LSRs. Unauthorized write access to objects in these tables, could
      result in disruption of traffic on the network. This is especially
      true if a tunnel has already been established.

   Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their



Nadeau and Farrel            Expires October 2006           [Page 47]

          draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib-15.txt         April 20, 2006



   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the gmplsTunnelTable, gmplsTunnelHopTable, gmplsTunnelARHopTable,
      gmplsTunnelCHopTable, gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable, and the
      gmplsTunnelErrorTable collectively show the tunnel network
      topology and status. If an Administrator does not want to reveal
      this information, then these tables should be considered
      sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
   these MIB modules.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   This document is a product of the CCAMP Working Group.

   This document extends [RFC3812]. The authors would like to express
   their gratitude to all those who worked on that earlier MIB document.
   Thanks also to Tony Zinicola and Jeremy Crossen for their valuable
   contributions during an early implementation, and to Baktha
   Muralidharan, Tom Petch, Dave Thaler and Bert Wijnen for their review
   comments.

   Special thanks to Joan Cucchiara and Len Nieman for their help with

11. IANA Considerations

-- We request that you assign contiguous RFC numbers to the three GMPLS
-- MIB documents.
-- The first number to draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-tc-mib, the second to
-- draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-lsr-mib, and the third to
-- draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib.
-- (Please remove this note prior to publication.)

   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module contained in
   this document under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
   In the future, GMPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB (sic) subtree. IANA has been requested to
   manage that namespace in the SMI Numbers registry [RFC3811]. New
   assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in
   [RFC2434].

11.1. IANA Considerations for GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB XXX } to the
   GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB module specified in this document, and to record
   the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

-- RFC Editor. Please replace XXX above with assigned OID and remove
-- this note

11.2. Dependence on IANA MIB Modules

   Three MIB objects in this MIB module (gmplsTunnelLSPEncoding,
   gmplsTunnelSwitchingType, and gmplsTunnelGPid) use textual
   conventions imported from the IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB. The purpose of
   defining these textual conventions in a separate MIB module is to
   allow additional values to be defined without having to issue a new
   version of this document. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) is responsible for the assignment of all Internet numbers; it
   will administer the values associated with these textual conventions.

   The rules for additions or changes to the IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB are
   outlined in the DESCRIPTION clause associated with its
   MODULE-IDENTITY statement.

   The current versions of the IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB can be accessed from
   the IANA home page at: "http://www.iana.org/".

11.2.1. IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB Definition

   This is a temporary section intended to supply the base definition of
   an IANA MIB module. The normal procedure is that this MIB module is
   moved into the direct control of IANA, at which time this section
   should be deleted from this document.

-- define additional values but these will not be used by this MIB
