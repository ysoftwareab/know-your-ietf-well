Abstract

   When an IP multicast tree needs to pass through an MPLS domain, it is
   advantageous to map the tree to a Point-to-Multipoint or Multipoint-
   to-Multipoint Label Switched Path.  This document specifies a way to

Internet-Draft         In-band signaling with mLDP        September 2008


   provide a one-one mapping between IP multicast trees and Label
   Switched Paths.  The IP multicast control messages are translated
   into MPLS control messages when they enter the MPLS domain, and are
   translated back into IP multicast control messages at the far end of
   the MPLS domain.  The IP multicast control information is coded into
   the MPLS control information in such a way as to ensure that a single
   Multipoint Label Switched Path gets set up for each IP multicast
   tree.

Internet-Draft         In-band signaling with mLDP        September 2008


1.  Introduction

   The mLDP specification [3] describes mechanisms for creating point-
   to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint MP2MP LSPs.  These
   LSPs are typically used for transporting enduser multicast packets.
   However, the mLDP specification [3] does not provide any rules for
   associating particular enduser multicast packets with any particular
   LSP.  Other drafts, like [7], describe applications in which out-of-
   band signaling protocols, such as PIM and BGP, are used to establish
   the mapping between an LSP and the multicast packets that need to be
   forwarded over the LSP.

   This draft describes an application in which the information needed
   to establish the mapping between an LSP and the set of multicast
   packets to be forwarded over it is carried in the "opaque value"
   field of an mLDP FEC element.  When an IP multicast tree (either a
   source-specific tree or a bidirectional tree) enters the MPLS
   network, the IP multicast control messages used to set up the tree
   are translated into mLDP messages.  The (S,G) or (*,G) information
   from the IP multicast control messages is carried in the opaque value
   field of the mLDP FEC message.  As the tree leaves the MPLS network,
   this information is extracted from the FEC element and used to build
   the IP multicast control messages that are sent outside the MPLS
   domain.  Note that although the IP multicast control messages are
   sent periodically, the mLDP messages are not.

   Each IP multicast tree is mapped one-to-one to a P2MP or MP2MP LSP in
   the MPLS network.  This type of service works well if the number of
   LSPs that are created is under control of the MPLS network operator,
   or if the number of LSPs for a particular service are known to be
   limited in number.

1.2.  Terminology


   IP multicast tree :  An IP multicast distribution tree identified by
      an source IP address and/or IP multicast destination address, also
      refered to as (S,G) and (*,G).

Internet-Draft         In-band signaling with mLDP        September 2008


   mLDP :  Multicast LDP.


   Transit LSP :  An P2MP or MP2MP LSP whose FEC element contains the
      (S,G) or (*,G) identifying a particular IP multicast distribution
      tree.


   In-band signaling :  Using the opaque value of a mLDP FEC element to
      signal multicast route information.


   P2MP LSP:  An LSP that has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress
      LSRs.


   MP2MP LSP:  An LSP that connects a set of leaf nodes, acting
      indifferently as ingress or egress.


   MP LSP:  A multipoint LSP, either a P2MP or an MP2MP LSP.


   Ingress LSR:  Source of the P2MP LSP, also referred to as root node.


   Egress LSR:  One of potentially many destinations of an LSP, also
      referred to as leaf node in the case of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs.


   Transit LSR:  An LSR that has one or more directly connected
      downstream LSRs.


2.  In-band signaling for MP LSPs

   Suppose an LSR, call it D, is attached to a network that is capable
   of MPLS multicast and IP multicast, and D receives a PIM Join from
   the IP multicast interface.  The PIM Join identifies a particular IP
   multicast tree.  Suppose that D can determine that the IP multicast
   tree needs to travel through the MPLS network until it reaches some
   other LSR, U. For instance, when D looks up the route to the Source
   or Rendezvous Point (RP) [4] of the IP multicast tree, it may
   discover that the route is a BGP route with U as the BGP next hop.
   Then D may chose to set up a P2MP or MP2MP LSP, with U as root, and
   to make that LSP become part of the IP multicast distribution tree
   identified by the PIM Join.  Note that other methods are possible to
   determine that an IP multicast tree is to be transported across an

   MPLS network using P2MP or MP2MP LSPs.  These methods are out of
   scope of this document.

   Source or RP addresses that are reachable in a VPN context are out
   the scope of this draft.

   In order to send the multicast stream via a P2MP or MP2MP LSP using
   in-band signaling the source and the group will be encoded into an
   mLDP opaque TLV encoding [3].  The type of encoding depends on the IP
   version.  The tree type (P2MP or MP2MP) depends on whether this is a
   source specific or a bidirectional multicast stream.  The root of the
   tree is Ingress LSR that was found during the route lookup on the
   source or RP.  Using this information a mLDP FEC is created and the
   LSP is build towards the root of the LSP.

   When an LSR receives a label mapping or withdraw and discovers it is
   the root of the identified P2MP or MP2MP LSP, then the following
   procedure will be executed.  If the opaque encoding of the FEC
   indicates this is an Transit LSP (indicated by the opaque type), the
   opaque TLV will be decoded and the multicast source and group is
   passed to the multicast code.  If the multicast tree information was
   received via a label mapping, the multicast code will effectively
   treat this as having received a PIM join from the MPLS network.  If
   it was due to a label withdraw, the multicast code will effectively
   treat this as having received a PIM prune from the MPLS network.
   From this point on normal PIM process will occur and multicast
   packets are forwarded to the LSP or pruned from the LSP.

2.1.  Transiting IP multicast source trees

   IP multicast source trees can either be created via PIM operating in
   SSM mode [5] or ASM mode [4] and MUST be transporting across the MPLS
   network using a P2MP LSP.  A Transit LSP may be setup to forward the
   IP multicast traffic across an MPLS core.  If the multicast source is
   reachable in a global table the source and group addresses are
   encoded into the a transit TLV.  Depending on the IP version it is
   either Section 3.1 or Section 3.2.

2.2.  Transiting IP multicast bidirectional trees

   Bidirectional IP multicast trees [6] MUST be transported across a
   MPLS network using MP2MP LSPs.  A bidirectional tree does not have a
   specific source address; only the group address and subnet mask are
   relevant for multicast forwarding.  The RP for the Multicast group is
   used to select the ingress PE and root of the LSP.  How the RP is
   discovered for the multicast group is out the scope of this document.
   The group address is encoded in either Section 3.3 or Section 3.4,
   depending on the IP version.  The subnet mask associated with the

Internet-Draft         In-band signaling with mLDP        September 2008


   bidirectional group is encoded in the Transit TLV.  IP Multicast
   bidirectional state created due to a PIM join typically has a subnet
   mask of 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6.  IP Multicast bidirectional
   state created for a sender only branch has a variable subnet mask
   that is assigned by the RP mapping protocol.

2.3.  Transiting IP multicast shared Trees

   Nothing prevents PIM shared trees from being transported across a
   MPLS core.  However, it is not possible to prune of individual
   sources from the shared tree without the use of an additional out-of-
   band signaling protocol, like PIM.  For that reason transiting Shared
   Trees across a Transit LSP is out the scope of this draft.
