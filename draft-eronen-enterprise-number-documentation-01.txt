Internet-Draft   Enterprise Number for Documentation Use      March 2009


1.  Introduction

   RFC 1065 [RFC1065] (later superceded by [RFC1155] and [RFC2578])
   created a subtree (arc) of object identifiers (OIDs) for identifying
   management objects that are defined unilaterally by a single party,
   such as an enterprise.  The subtree for a particular enterprise
   consists of the prefix "1.3.6.1.4.1.", followed by the Enterprise
   Number assigned for that enterprise.

   Enterprise Numbers are allocated by IANA, and are also known as
   "Private Enterprise Numbers", "Enterprise Codes", and "SMI (Structure
   of Management Information) Network Management Private Enterprise
   Codes".  See [Application] for more information on how to request an
   Enterprise Number from IANA, and [Numbers] for the list of currently
   assigned numbers.

   Enterprise Numbers have also been used for many other purposes than
   OIDs in various protocols; for example:

   o  "STRUCTURED-DATA" identifiers in Syslog [RFC5424]
   o  "Vendor-Specific" RADIUS attributes [RFC2865]
   o  Mobile IPv4 vendor/organization-specific extensions [RFC3115]
   o  User-defined error information in RSVP [RFC5284]
   o  Vendor options in DHCPv4 [RFC3925]
   o  Enterprise-specific information elements in IP Flow Information
      Export (IPFIX) protocol [RFC5101]

   Documents related to these protocols may include examples that
   contain Enterprise Numbers.  To reduce the likelihood of conflict and
   confusion, this document specifies an Enterprise Number for use in
   examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.


2.  Enterprise Number for Documentation Use

   The Enterprise Number 32473 has been allocated for use in examples in
   RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update (has updated) the registration for Enterprise
   Number 32473 to point to this RFC.


4.  Security Considerations

   Allocating an enterprise number for documentation use does not have

   any direct impact on security.


5.  Acknowledgments

   The need for an Enterprise Number for documentation use was
   identified by Rainer Gerhards for the examples in [RFC5424].  The
   authors would also like to thank Michelle Cotton for her help, and
   Alfred Hoenes for his comments.  This document borrows text from
   [RFC5398] and ideas from [RFC4735].
