    1. Introduction 

       This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
       Base (MIB) for use in energy management of devices within or 
       connected to communication networks.  The MIB modules in this 
       document are designed to provide a model for energy management, 
       which includes monitoring for Power State and energy consumption 
       of networked elements.  This MIB takes into account the Energy 
       Management Framework [RFC7326], which, in turn, is based on the 
       Requirements for Energy Management [RFC6988]. 
        
       Energy management can be applied to devices in communication 
       networks. Target devices for this specification include (but are 
       not limited to): routers, switches, Power over Ethernet (PoE) 
       endpoints, protocol gateways for building management systems, 
       intelligent meters, home energy gateways, hosts and servers, 
       sensor proxies, etc. Target devices and the use cases for Energy 
       Management are discussed in Energy Management Applicability 
       Statement [EMAN-AS]. 
        
       Where applicable, device monitoring extends to the individual 
       components of the device and to any attached dependent devices. 
       For example: A device can contain components that are 
       independent from a power-state point of view, such as line 
       cards, processor cards, hard drives.  A device can also have

       dependent attached devices, such as a switch with PoE endpoints 
       or a power distribution unit with attached endpoints. 
        
        
    2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

       For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
       current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
       section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
        
       Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
       termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
       generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
       Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
       mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
       (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
       SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
       RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
        
        
    3. Use Cases 

       Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
       devices are specified in [RFC6988].  The requirements in 
       [RFC6988] cover devices typically found in communications 
       networks, such as switches, routers, and various connected 
       endpoints.  For a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it 
       should also apply to facility meters, power distribution units, 
       gateway proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
       devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
       smart grid.  Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this 
       document are broader than that specified in [RFC6988]. Several 
       use cases for Energy Management have been identified in the 
       "Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement" [EMAN-AS].

    5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Modules 

       This section describes the concepts specified in the Energy 
       Management Framework [RFC7326] that pertain to power usage, with 
       specific information related to the MIB module specified in this 
       document.  This subsection maps concepts developed in the Energy 
       Management Framework [RFC7326]. 
        
       The Energy Monitoring MIB has 2 independent MIB modules, ENERGY-
       OBJECT-MIB and POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB. The first, ENERGY-OBJECT-
       MIB, is focused on measurement of power and energy. The second, 
       POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB, is focused on power quality measurements 
       for Energy Objects. 
        
       Devices and their sub-components can be modeled using the 
       containment tree of the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].  
        
    5.1. Energy Object Tables 

    5.1.1. ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB 

       The ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB module consists of five tables.   

       The first table is the eoMeterCapabilitiesTable.  It indicates 
       the instrumentation available for each Energy Object.  Entries 
       in this table indicate which other tables from the ENERGY-
       OBJECT-MIB and POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB are available for each 
       Energy Object.  The eoMeterCapabilitiesTable is indexed by 
       entPhysicalIndex [RFC6933]. 
        
       The second table is the eoPowerTable.  It reports the power 
       consumption of each Energy Object, as well as the units, sign, 
       measurement accuracy, and related objects.  The eoPowerTable is 
       indexed by entPhysicalIndex. 
        
     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015            [Page 5] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
       The third table is the eoPowerStateTable.  For each Energy 
       Object, it reports information and statistics about the 
       supported Power States.  The eoPowerStateTable is indexed by 
       entPhysicalIndex and eoPowerStateIndex. 
        
       The fourth table is the eoEnergyParametersTable.  The entries in 
       this table configure the parameters of energy and demand 
       measurement collection.  This table is indexed by 
       eoEnergyParametersIndex.  
        
       The fifth table is the eoEnergyTable.  The entries in this table 
       provide a log of the energy and demand information.  This table 
       is indexed by eoEnergyParametersIndex. 
       A "smidump-style" tree presentation of the MIB modules contained 
       in the draft is presented. The meaning of the three symbols is a 
       compressed representation of the object's MAX-ACCESS clause 
       which may have the following values: 
         
                "not-accessible"         ->  "---"  
                "accessible-for-notify"  ->  "--n"  
                "read-only"              ->  "r-n"  
                "read-write"             ->  "rwn"

    5.1.2. POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB 

             
       The POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB module consists of three tables.   

       The first table is the eoACPwrAttributesTable.  It indicates the 
       power quality available for each Energy Object.  The 
       eoACPwrAttributesTable is indexed by entPhysicalIndex [RFC6933]. 
        
       The second table is the eoACPwrAttributesDelPhaseTable.  The 
       entries in this table configure the parameters of energy and

       demand measurement collection.  This table is indexed by 
       eoEnergyParametersIndex.  
        
       The third table is the eoACPwrAttributesWyePhaseTable.  For each 
       Energy Object, it reports information and statistics about the 
       supported Power States.  The eoPowerStateTable is indexed by 
       entPhysicalIndex and eoPowerStateIndex.

    5.2. Energy Object Identity 

       The Energy Object identity information is specified in the 
       ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] primary table, 
     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015           [Page 11] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
       i.e., the eoTable.  In this table, Energy Object context such as 
       domain, role description, and importance are specified.  In 
       addition, the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module specifies the 
       relationship between Energy Objects.  There are several possible 
       relationships between Energy Objects, such as meteredBy, 
       metering, poweredBy, powering, aggregatedBy, and aggregating as 
       defined in the IANA-ENERGY-RELATION-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].  
     

    5.3. Power State 

       An Energy Object may have energy conservation modes called Power 
       States.  Between the ON and OFF states of a device, there can be 
       several intermediate energy saving modes.  Those energy saving 
       modes are called Power States.  
        
       Power States, which represent universal states of power 
       management of an Energy Object, are specified by the 
       eoPowerState MIB object.  The actual Power State is specified by 
       the eoPowerOperState MIB object, while the eoPowerAdminState MIB 
       object specifies the Power State requested for the Energy 
       Object. The difference between the values of eoPowerOperState 
       and eoPowerAdminState indicates that the Energy Object is busy 
       transitioning from eoPowerAdminState into the eoPowerOperState, 
       at which point it will update the content of eoPowerOperState.  
       In addition, the possible reason for change in Power State is 
       reported in eoPowerStateEnterReason.  Regarding 
       eoPowerStateEnterReason, management stations and Energy Objects 
       should support any format of the owner string dictated by the 
       local policy of the organization.  It is suggested that this 
       name contain at least the reason for the transition change, and 
       one or more of the following: IP address, management station 
       name, network manager's name, location, or phone number. 
        
       The MIB objects eoPowerOperState, eoPowerAdminState , and 
       eoPowerStateEnterReason are contained in the eoPowerTable MIB 
       table. 
           
       The eoPowerStateTable table enumerates the maximum power usage 
       in watts for every single supported Power State of each Power 
       State Set supported by the Energy Object.  In addition, 
       PowerStateTable provides additional statistics such as 
       eoPowerStateEnterCount, i.e., the number of times an entity has 
       visited a particular Power State, and eoPowerStateTotalTime, 
       i.e., the total time spent in a particular Power State of an 
       Energy Object.

    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
    5.3.1. Power State Set 

       There are several standards and implementations of Power State 
       Sets.  An Energy Object can support one or multiple Power State 
       Set implementations concurrently.  
        
       There are currently three Power State Sets defined:   
        
         IEEE1621(256) - [IEEE1621] 
         DMTF(512)     - [DMTF] 
         EMAN(768)     - [RFC7326] 
     
       The Power State Sets are listed in [RFC7326] along with each 
       Power State within the Power Set.  The Power State Sets are 
       specified by the PowerStateSet Textual as an IANA-maintained MIB 
       module. The initial version of this MIB module is specified in 
       this document. 

        
    5.4. Energy Object Usage Information 

       For an Energy Object, power usage is reported using eoPower.  
       The magnitude of measurement is based on the 
       eoPowerUnitMultiplier MIB variable, based on the UnitMultiplier 
       Textual Convention (TC). Power measurement magnitude should 
       conform to the IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22 
       [IEC.62053-22] definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System 
       International) units of measure.  Measured values are 
       represented in SI units obtained by BaseValue * 10 raised to the 
       power of the unit multiplier.   
         
       For example, if current power usage of an Energy Object is 3, it 
       could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value of 
       eoPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout 
       the two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, 
       including eoPowerStatePowerUnitMultiplier, 
       eoEnergyUnitMultiplier, and oACPwrAttributesPowerUnitMultiplier. 
        
       In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to 
       know how an eoPower measurement was obtained.  An NMS can use 
       this to account for the accuracy and nature of the reading 
       between different implementations.  eoPowerMeasurementLocal 
       describes whether the measurements were made at the device 
       itself or from a remote source.  The eoPowerMeasurementCaliber 
       describes the method that was used to measure the power and can 
       distinguish actual or estimated values.  There may be devices in 
       the network, which may not be able to measure or report power 
       consumption.  For those devices, the object 
       eoPowerMeasurementCaliber shall report that the measurement 
       mechanism is "unavailable" and the eoPower measurement shall be 
       "0".

       The nameplate power rating of an Energy Object is specified in 
       eoPowerNameplate MIB object. 
        
        
    5.5. Optional Power Usage Attributes  

       The optional POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB module can be implemented to 
       further describe power usage attributes measurement.  The POWER-
       ATTRIBUTES-MIB module is aligned with IEC 61850 7-2 standard to 
       describe AC measurements.   
        
       The POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB module contains a primary table, 
       eoACPwrAttributesTable, that defines power attributes 
       measurements for supported entPhysicalIndex entities, as a 
       sparse extension of the eoPowerTable (with entPhysicalIndex as 
       primary index).  This eoACPwrAttributesTable table contains such 
       information as the configuration (single phase, DEL 3 phases, 
       WYE 3 phases), voltage, frequency, power accuracy, total 
       active/reactive power/apparent power, amperage, and voltage.  
        
       In case of 3-phase power, an additional table is populated with 
       Power Attributes measurements per phase (hence, double indexed 
       by the entPhysicalIndex and a phase index).  This table, 
       describes attributes specific to either WYE or DEL 
       configurations. 
        
       In a DEL configuration, the eoACPwrAttributesDelPhaseTable 
       describes the phase-to-phase power attributes measurements, 
       i.e., voltage.  In a DEL configuration, the current is equal in 
       all three phases.  
        
       In a WYE configuration, the eoACPwrAttributesWyePhaseTable 
       describes the phase-to-neutral power attributes measurements, 
       i.e., voltage, current, active/reactive/apparent power, and 
       power factor. 
        
    5.6. Optional Energy Measurement 

       It is only relevant to measure energy and demand when there are 
       actual power measurements obtained from measurement hardware. If 
       the eoPowerMeasurementCaliber MIB object has values of 
       unavailable, unknown, estimated, or presumed, then the energy 
       and demand values are not useful. 
        
       Two tables are introduced to characterize energy measurement of 
       an Energy Object: eoEnergyTable and eoEnergyParametersTable.  
       Both energy and demand information can be represented via the 
       eoEnergyTable.  Demand information can be represented.  
       The eoEnergyParametersTable consists of the parameters defining

       eoEnergyParametersIndex - an index for the Energy Object, 
       eoEnergyObjectIndex - linked to the entPhysicalIndex of the 
       Energy Object, the duration of measurement intervals in seconds, 
       (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength), the number of successive 
       intervals to be stored in the eoEnergyTable, 
       (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber), the type of measurement 
       technique (eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode), and a sample rate 
       used to calculate the average (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate).  
       Judicious choice of the sampling rate will ensure accurate 
       measurement of energy while not imposing an excessive polling 
       burden. 
         
       There are three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types used for 
       energy measurement collection: period, sliding, and total.  The 
       choices of the three different modes of collection are based on 
       IEC standard 61850-7-4.  Note that multiple 
       eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types MAY be configured 
       simultaneously.  It is important to note that for a given Energy 
       Object, multiple modes (periodic, total, sliding window) of 
       energy measurement collection can be configured with the use of 
       eoEnergyParametersIndex.  However, simultaneous measurement in 
       multiple modes for a given Energy Object depends on the Energy 
       Object capability.  
     
       These three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types are illustrated 
       by the following three figures, for which: 
        
       - The horizontal axis represents the current time, with the 
       symbol <--- L ---> expressing the 
       eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength, and the 
       eoEnergyCollectionStartTime is represented by S1, S2, S3, S4, 
       ..., Sx where x is the value of 
       eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber. 
        
       - The vertical axis represents the time interval of sampling and 
       the value of eoEnergyConsumed can be obtained at the end of the 
       sampling period.  The symbol =========== denotes the duration of 
       the sampling period.

       A eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode type of 'period' specifies non-
       overlapping periodic measurements.  Therefore, the next 
       eoEnergyCollectionStartTime is equal to the previous 
       eoEnergyCollectionStartTime plus 
       eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength. S2=S1+L; S3=S2+L, ...

       A eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode type of 'total' specifies a 
       continuous measurement since the last reset.  The value of 
       eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber should be (1) one and 
       eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength is ignored. 
        
       The eoEnergyParametersStatus is used to start and stop energy 
       usage logging.  The status of this variable is "active" when all 
       the objects in eoEnergyParametersTable are appropriate which in 
       turn indicates if eoEnergyTable entries exist or not. Finally, 
       the eoEnergyParametersStorageType variable indicates the storage 
       type for this row, i.e. whether the persistence is maintained 
       across a device reload. 
        
       The eoEnergyTable consists of energy measurements in 
       eoEnergyConsumed, eoEnergyProvided and eoEnergyStored, the units 
       of the measured energy eoEnergyUnitMultiplier, and the maximum 
       observed energy within a window eoEnergyMaxConsumed, 
       eoEnergyMaxProduced.    
        
       Measurements of the total energy consumed by an Energy Object 
       may suffer from interruptions in the continuous measurement of 
       energy consumption.  In order to indicate such interruptions, 
       the object eoEnergyDiscontinuityTime is provided for indicating 
       the time of the last interruption of total energy measurement.  
       eoEnergyDiscontinuityTime shall indicate the sysUpTime [RFC3418] 
       when the device was reset.  
        
       The following example illustrates the eoEnergyTable and 
       eoEnergyParametersTable: 
        
       First, in order to estimate energy, a time interval to sample 
       energy should be specified, i.e., 
       eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength can be set to "900 seconds" or 
       15 minutes and the number of consecutive intervals over which 
       the maximum energy is calculated 
       (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber) as "10".  The sampling rate 
       internal to the Energy Object for measurement of power usage 
       (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate) can be "1000 milliseconds", as 
       set by the Energy Object as a reasonable value.  Then, the 
       eoEnergyParametersStatus is set to active to indicate that the 
       Energy Object should start monitoring the usage per the 
       eoEnergyTable. 
        
       The indices for the eoEnergyTable are eoEnergyParametersIndex, 
       which identifies the index for the setting of energy measurement 
       collection Energy Object, and eoEnergyCollectionStartTime, which 
       denotes the start time of the energy measurement interval based 
       on sysUpTime [RFC3418].  The value of eoEnergyComsumed is the 
       measured energy consumption over the time interval specified 
       (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Energy Object 
       internal sampling rate (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate).  While 
     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015           [Page 17] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
       choosing the values for the eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength and 
       eoEnergyParametersSampleRate, it is recommended to take into 
       consideration either the network element resources adequate to 
       process and store the sample values, and the mechanism used to 
       calculate the eoEnergyConsumed.  The units are derived from 
       eoEnergyUnitMultiplier.  For example, eoEnergyConsumed can be 
       "100" with eoEnergyUnitMultiplier equal to 0, the measured 
       energy consumption of the Energy Object is 100 watt-hours.  The 
       eoEnergyMaxConsumed is the maximum energy observed and that can 
       be "150 watt-hours". 
        
       The eoEnergyTable has a buffer to retain a certain number of 
       intervals, as defined by eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.   
       If the default value of "10" is kept, then the eoEnergyTable 
       contains 10 energy measurements, including the maximum.   
        
       Here is a brief explanation of how the maximum energy can be 
       calculated.  The first observed energy measurement value is 
       taken to be the initial maximum.  With each subsequent 
       measurement, based on numerical comparison, maximum energy may 
       be updated.  The maximum value is retained as long as the 
       measurements are taking place.  Based on periodic polling of 
       this table, an NMS could compute the maximum over a longer 
       period, e.g., a month, 3 months, or a year. 
     

    5.7. Fault Management 

       [RFC6988] specifies requirements about Power States such as "the 
       current Power State" , "the time of the last state change", "the 
       total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions to 
       each state" etc.  Some of these requirements are fulfilled 
       explicitly by MIB objects such as eoPowerOperState, 
       eoPowerStateTotalTime and eoPowerStateEnterCount.  Some of the 
       other requirements are met via the SNMP NOTIFICATION mechanism.  
       eoPowerStateChange SNMP notification which is generated when the 
       value of oPowerStateIndex, eoPowerOperState, or 
       eoPowerAdminState have changed.  
        
         
    6. Discovery 

       It is probable that most Energy Objects will require the 
       implementation of the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] 
       as a prerequisite for this MIB module.  In such a case, 
       eoPowerTable of the EMAN-ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB is cross-referenced 
       with the eoTable of ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB via 
       entPhysicalIndex.  Every Energy Object MUST implement 
       entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalClass, entPhysicalName and 
       entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].  As the primary 
       index for the Energy Object, entPhysicalIndex is used: It 
     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015           [Page 18] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
       characterizes the Energy Object in the ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB and the 
       POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB MIB modules (this document). 

       The NMS must first poll the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB MIB module 
       [EMAN-AWARE-MIB], if available, in order to discover all the 
       Energy Objects and the relationships between those Energy 
       Objects. In the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module tables, the 
       Energy Objects are indexed by the entPhysicalIndex. 

       From there, the NMS must poll the eoPowerStateTable (specified 
       in the ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB module in this document), which 
       enumerates, amongst other things, the maximum power usage.  As 
       the entries in eoPowerStateTable table are indexed by the  
       Energy Object ( entPhysicalIndex) and by the Power State Set 
       (eoPowerStateIndex), the maximum power usage is discovered per  
       Energy Object, and the power usage per Power State of the Power 
       State Set.  In other words, reading the eoPowerStateTable allows 
       the discovery of each Power State within every Power State Set 
       supported by the Energy Object.               

       The MIB module may be populated with the Energy Object 
       relationship information, which have its own Energy Object index 
       value (entPhysicalIndex). However, the Energy Object 
       relationship must be discovered via the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-
       MIB module.  

       Finally, the NMS can monitor the power attributes with the 
       POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB MIB module, which reuses the 
       entPhysicalIndex to index the Energy Object. 

                                     
    7. Link with the other IETF MIBs 

        
    7.1. Link with the ENTITY-MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB  

       RFC 6933 [RFC6933] defines the ENTITY-MIB module that lists the 
       physical entities of a networking device (router, switch, etc.) 
       and those physical entities indexed by entPhysicalIndex.  From 
       an energy-management standpoint, the physical entities that 
       consume or produce energy are of interest. 
        
       RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
       provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
       value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
       data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
       devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
       entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].  While the focus 
       of the Power, Energy Monitoring and Control MIB is on 
       measurement of power usage of networking equipment indexed by 
       the ENTITY-MIB, this MIB supports a customized power scale for 
     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015           [Page 19] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
       power measurement and different Power States of networking 
       equipment, and functionality to configure the Power States. 
        
       The Energy Objects are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through 
       the entPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the eoTable in the 
       ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].   

       The ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] does not have the ANSI C12.x 
       accuracy classes required for electricity (e.g., 1%, 2%, 0.5% 
       accuracy classes). Indeed, entPhySensorPrecision [RFC3433] 
       represents "The number of decimal places of precision in fixed-
       point sensor values returned by the associated entPhySensorValue 
       object".  The ANSI and IEC Standards are used for power 
       measurement and these standards require that we use an accuracy 
       class, not the scientific-number precision model specified in 
       RFC3433.  The eoPowerAccuracy MIB object models this accuracy.  
       Note that eoPowerUnitMultipler represents the scale factor per 
       IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22 [IEC.62053-22], 
       which is a more logical representation for power measurements 
       (compared to entPhySensorScale), with the mantissa and the 
       exponent values X * 10 ^ Y. 

       Power measurements specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each 
       measured value in watts are used in the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, POE 
       [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.  The same 'UNITS' qualifier 
       is used for the power measurement values.    
        
       One cannot assume that the ENTITY-MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB are 
       implemented for all Energy Objects that need to be monitored.  A 
       typical example is a converged building gateway, which can 
       monitor other devices in a building and provides a proxy between 
       SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
       energy controller.  In such cases, the eoPhysicalEntity value 
       contains the zero value, using the PhysicalIndexOrZero textual 
       convention. 
        
       The eoPower is similar to entPhySensorValue [RFC3433] and the 
       eoPowerUnitMultipler is similar to entPhySensorScale. 
        
        
    7.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE MIB  

       For each entity in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933], the ENTITY-STATE 
       MIB [RFC4268] specifies the operational states (entStateOper: 
       unknown, enabled, disabled, testing), the alarm (entStateAlarm: 
       unknown, underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning, 
       indeterminate) and the possible values of standby states  
       (entStateStandby: unknown, hotStandby, coldStandby, 
       providingService). 
        

     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015           [Page 20] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
       From a power monitoring point of view, in contrast to the entity 
       operational states of entities, Power States are required, as 
       proposed in the Power, Energy Monitoring and Control MIB module.  
       Those Power States can be mapped to the different operational 
       states in the ENTITY-STATE MIB, if a formal mapping is required.  
       For example, the entStateStandby "unknown", "hotStandby", 
       "coldStandby", states could map to the Power State "unknown", 
       "ready", "standby", respectively, while the entStateStandby 
       "providingService" could map to any "low" to "high" Power State. 
        
        
    7.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB 

       Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] provides an energy monitoring 
       and configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  
       RFC 3621 defines a port group entity on a switch for power 
       monitoring and management policy and does not use the 
       entPhysicalIndex index.  Indeed, pethMainPseConsumptionPower is 
       indexed by the pethMainPseGroupIndex, which has no mapping with 
       the entPhysicalIndex.  
        
       If the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the 
       Energy Object eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex contain the 
       pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively. 
       However, one cannot assume that the Power-over-Ethernet MIB is 
       implemented for most or all Energy Objects. In such cases, the 
       eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex values contain the zero 
       value, via the new PethPsePortIndexOrZero and textual 
       PethPsePortGroupIndexOrZero conventions. 
        
       In either case, the entPhysicalIndex MIB object is used as the 
       unique Energy Object index. 
        
       Note that, even though the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] was 
       created after the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433], it does not reuse 
       the precision notion from the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB, i.e., the 
       entPhySensorPrecision MIB object. 
        
         
    7.4. Link with the UPS MIB 

       To protect against unexpected power disruption, data centers and 
       buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).  To 
       protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular 
       subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically lasts only 
       for a finite period of time, until normal power supply is 
       restored.  Planning is required to decide on the capacity of the 
       UPS based on output power and duration of probable power outage.  
       To properly provision UPS power in a data center or building, it 
       is important to first understand the total demand required to 
       support all the entities in the site.  This demand can be

       assessed and monitored via the Power, Energy Monitoring and 
       Control MIB.  

       UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS 
       network.  Implementation of the UPS MIB is useful at the 
       aggregate level of a data center or a building.  The MIB module 
       contains several groups of variables: 

       - upsIdent: Identifies the UPS entity (name, model, etc.).  

       - upsBattery group: Indicates the battery state 
       (upsbatteryStatus, upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining, etc.) 

       - upsInput group: Characterizes the input load to the UPS 
       (number of input lines, voltage, current, etc.). 

       - upsOutput: Characterizes the output from the UPS (number of 
       output lines, voltage, current, etc.) 

       - upsAlarms: Indicates the various alarm events.   

       The measurement of power in the UPS MIB is in volts, amperes and 
       watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts and RMS 
       Amperes. They are not based on the EntitySensorDataScale and 
       EntitySensorDataPrecision of ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB. 

       Both the Power, Energy Monitoring and Control MIB and the UPS 
       MIB may be implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without 
       conflict.  In this case, the UPS device itself is the Energy 
       Object and any of the UPS meters or submeters are the Energy 
       Objects with a possible relationship as defined in [RFC7326]. 
        
    7.5. Link with the LLDP and LLDP-MED MIBs 

       The LLDP Protocol is a Data Link Layer protocol used by network 
       devices to advertise their identities, capabilities, and 
       interconnections on a LAN network.  
        
       The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as 
       LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice 
       applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: capability 
       discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy 
       discovery, location identification discovery, inventory 
       discovery, and power discovery.   
        
       Of particular interest to the current MIB module is the power 
       discovery, which allows the endpoint device (such as a PoE 
       phone) to convey power requirements to the switch.  In power 
       discovery, LLDP-MED has four Type Length Values (TLVs): power 
       type, power source, power priority and power value.  
       Respectively, those TLVs provide information related to the type 
     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015           [Page 22] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
       of power (power sourcing entity versus powered device), how the 
       device is powered (from the line, from a backup source, from 
       external power source, etc.), the power priority (how important 
       is it that this device has power?), and how much power the 
       device needs. 
         
       The power priority specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB] 
       actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]. If 
       the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the exact 
       value from the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over 
       into the lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB]; 
       otherwise the value in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is 
       "unknown". From the Power, Energy Monitoring and Control MIB, it 
       is possible to identify the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621], 
       via the eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex. 
        
       The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to 
       eoPowerMeasurementLocal in indicating if the power for an 
       attached device is local or from a remote device. If the LLDP-
       MED MIB is supported, the following mapping can be applied to 
       the eoPowerMeasurementLocal: lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource 
       fromPSE(2) and local(3) can be mapped to false and true, 
       respectively. 
     

    8. Structure of the MIB 

       The primary MIB object in the energyObjectMib MIB module is the 
       energyObjectMibObjects root. The eoPowerTable table of 
       energyObjectMibObjects describes the power measurement 
       attributes of an Energy Object entity. The identity of a device 
       in terms of uniquely identification of the Energy Object and its 
       relationship to other entities in the network are addressed in 
       [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].  

       Logically, this MIB module is a sparse extension of the 
       ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB]. Thus the 
       following requirements which are applied to [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] are 
       also applicable. As a requirement for this MIB module, [EMAN-
       AWARE-MIB] SHOULD be implemented and as Module Compliance of 
       ENTITY-MIB V4 [RFC6933] with respect to entity4CRCompliance MUST 
       be supported which requires 4 MIB objects: entPhysicalIndex, 
       entPhysicalClass, entPhysicalName and entPhysicalUUID MUST be 
       implemented.  
         
       eoMeterCapabilitiesTable is useful to enable applications to 
       determine the capabilities supported by the local management 
       agent.  This table indicates the energy monitoring MIB groups 
       that are supported by the local management system. By reading 
       the value of this object, it is possible for applications to 
       know which tables contain the information and are usable without

       walking through the table and querying every element which 
       involves a trial-and-error process. 
     
       The power measurement of an Energy Object contains information 
       describing its power usage (eoPower) and its current Power State 
       (eoPowerOperState).  In addition to power usage, additional 
       information describing the units of measurement 
       (eoPowerAccuracy, eoPowerUnitMultiplier), how power usage 
       measurement was obtained  (eoPowerMeasurementCaliber), the 
       source of power measurement (eoPowerMeasurementLocal) and the 
       type of power (eoPowerCurrentType) are described. 
        
       An Energy Object may contain an optional eoEnergyTable to 
       describe energy measurement information over time. 
        
       An Energy Object may contain an optional eoACPwrAttributesTable 
       table (specified in the POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB module) that 
       describes the electrical characteristics associated with the 
       current Power State and usage. 
     
       An Energy Object may also contain optional battery information 
       associated with this entity.

               "IANAPowerState is a textual convention that describes 
               Power State Sets and Power State Set Values an Energy 
               Object supports. IANA has created a registry of Power 
               State supported by an Energy Object and IANA shall 
               administer the list of Power State Sets and Power 
               States. 
                
               The textual convention assumes that Power States in a 
               power state set are limited to 255 distinct values. For 
               a Power State Set S, the named number with the value S * 
               256 is allocated to indicate the Power State set. For a 
               Power State X in the Power State S, the named number 
               with the value S * 256 + X + 1 is allocated to represent 
               the Power State.

    10. Implementation Status  

        
       [Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the 
       reference to [RFC6982] before publication.] 
        
       This section records the status of known implementations of the 
       EMAN-Monitoring MIB at the time of posting of this Internet-
       Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982]. 
           
       The description of implementations in this section is intended 
       to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing 
       drafts to RFCs.

            Maturity:   Prototype based upon early drafts of the MIBs.  
                        We anticipate updating it to more recent  
                        documents as development schedules allow. 
        
            Coverage:   Code was generated to implement all MIB objects  
                        in ENTITY-MIB (Version 4),  
                        ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB,

    10.2. Cisco Systems 

        
            Organization:     Cisco Systems, Inc. 
        
            Maturity:   Prototype based upon early version drafts of  
                        the MIBs. We anticipate updating the MIB  
                        modules as when the drafts are updated.  
        
            Coverage:   Code was generated to implement all MIB objects 
                        in the ENTITY-MIB (Version 4), and  
                        ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB. 
                         
            Implementation experience:  The MIB modules are implemented 
                        on Cisco router platforms to measure and report 
                        router energy measurements. The documents are  
                        implementable.

    11. Security Considerations 

       There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB 
       module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
       create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
       in some network environments. The support for SET operations in 
       a non-secure environment without proper protection opens devices 
       to attack. These are the tables and objects and their 
       sensitivity/vulnerability:  
     
       - Unauthorized changes to the eoPowerOperState (via the 
          eoPowerAdminState ) MAY disrupt the power settings of the 
          differentEnergy Objects, and therefore the state of 
          functionality of the respective Energy Objects. 
       - Unauthorized changes to the eoEnergyParametersTable MAY 
          disrupt energy measurement in the eoEnergyTable table.  
        
       SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
       Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using 
       IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
       allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
       objects in this MIB module. 
     
    <Claise, et. Al>         Expires May 27 2015           [Page 62] 
    Internet-Draft  <Power, Energy Monitoring Control MIB> Nov 27 2014 
     
        
       Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described 
       by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations 
       claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full 
       support for authentication and privacy via the User-based 
       Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm 
       [RFC3826]. Implementations MAY also provide support for the 
       Transport Security Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in combination with a 
       secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353]. 
        
       Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
       RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
       enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
       responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
       an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give 
       access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
       legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) 
       them. 
        
       In certain situations, energy and power monitoring can reveal 
       sensitive information about individuals' activities and habits. 
       Implementors of this specification should use appropriate 
       privacy protections as discussed in Section 9 of RFC 6988 and 
       monitoring of individuals and homes should only occur with 
       proper authorization. 
        
     

    12. IANA Considerations 

       The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned 
       OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 

           Descriptor                   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 

           ----------                   ----------------------- 

           IANAPowerStateSet-MIB           { mib-2 xxx } 

           energyObjectMIB                 { mib-2 yyy } 

           powerAttributesMIB              { mib-2 zzz } 

     
       EDITOR'S NOTE (to be removed prior to publication):  IANA is 
       requested to assign a value for "xxx", "yyy" and "zzz" under the 
       'mib-2' subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers 
       registry.  When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is 
       asked to replace "xxx", "yyy" and "zzz" (here and in the MIB 
       module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.

    12.1. IANAPowerStateSet-MIB module  

       This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained 
       The initial set of Power State Sets are specified in [RFC7326].  
       IANA maintains a Textual Convention PowerStateSet in the 
       IANAPowerStateSet-MIB module, with the initial set of Power 
       State Sets and the Power States within those Power State Sets as 
       proposed in the [RFC7326].  The current version of PowerStateSet 
       Textual convention can be accessed 
       http://www.iana.org/assignments/power-state-sets.  

       New Assignments (and potential deprecation) to Power State Sets 
       shall be administered by IANA and the guidelines and procedures 
       are specified in [RFC7326], and will, as a consequence, update 
       the IANAPowerStateSet Textual Convention. 

    13. Contributors 

       This document results from the merger of two initial proposals. 
       The following persons made significant contributions either in 
       one of the initial proposals or in this document:
