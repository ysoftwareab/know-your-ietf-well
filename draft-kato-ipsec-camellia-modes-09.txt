Internet-Draft  Modes of Operation for Camellia for IPsec    August 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher
   algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, Counter (CTR) mode,
   and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode, as an IKEv2 [1] and
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [2] mechanism to provide
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, and connectionless
   integrity.

   Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camellia
   was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in
   2000.  It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,
   and it has been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.
   Camellia is suitable for implementation in software and hardware,
   offering encryption speed in software and hardware implementations
   that is comparable to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [9].

   Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
   lengths, i.e., the same interface specifications as the AES.
   Therefore, it is easy to implement Camellia based algorithms by
   replacing the AES block of AES based algorithms with a Camellia
   block.

   Camellia has been adopted as one of the three ISO/IEC international
   standard [10] 128-bit block ciphers (Camellia, AES, and SEED).
   Camellia was selected as a recommended cryptographic primitive by the
   EU NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and
   Encryption) project [11] and was included in the list of
   cryptographic techniques for Japanese e-Government systems that was
   selected by the Japanese CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and
   Evaluation Committees) [12].

   Since optimized source code is provided under several open source
   licenses [13], Camellia is also adopted by several open source
   projects (OpenSSL, FreeBSD, Linux, and Firefox Gran Paradiso).

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [3].

   The Camellia web site [13] contains a wealth of information about
   Camellia, including detailed specification, security analysis,
   performance figures, reference implementation, optimized
   implementation, test vectors, and intellectual property information.

   The remainder of this document specifies use of various modes of
   operation for Camellia within the context of IPsec ESP.  For further
   information on how the various pieces of IPsec in general and ESP in
   particular fit together to provide security services, please refer to

2.  The Camellia Cipher Algorithm

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys, block size, and
   rounds.  The following sections contain descriptions of the relevant
   characteristics of Camellia.

2.1.  Key Size

   Camellia supports three key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.
   The default key size is 128 bits, and all implementations MUST
   support this key size.  Implementations MAY also support key sizes of
   192 bits and 256 bits.

   Camellia uses a different number of rounds for each of the defined
   key sizes.  When a 128-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 18
   rounds.  When a 192-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 24
   rounds.  When a 256-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 24
   rounds.

2.2.  Weak Keys

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.

2.3.  Block Size and Padding

   Camellia uses a block size of 16 octets (128 bits).

   Padding requirements are described:

   a) Camellia Padding requirement is specified in [2],
   b) Camellia-CBC Padding requirement is specified in [2],
   c) Camellia-CCM Padding requirement is specified in [5],
   d) ESP Padding requirement is specified in [2].

2.4.  Performance

   Performance figures for Camellia are available at [13].  The NESSIE
   project has reported on the performance of optimized implementations
   independently [11].

Internet-Draft  Modes of Operation for Camellia for IPsec    August 2008


3.  Modes

   NIST has defined seven modes of operation for AES and other FIPS-
   approved ciphers : CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), ECB (Electronic
   CodeBook), CFB (Cipher FeedBack), OFB (Output FeedBack), CTR
   (Counter), CMAC (Cipher-based MAC), and CCM (Counter with CBC MAC).

3.1.  Cipher Block Chaining

   The CBC mode is well defined and well understood for symmetric
   ciphers, and it is currently used for all other ESP ciphers.  This
   document specifies the use of the Camellia cipher in CBC mode within
   ESP.  This mode MUST have an Initialization Vector (IV) size that is
   the same as the block size.  Use of a randomly generated IV prevents
   generation of identical ciphertext from packets that have identical
   data spanning the first block of the cipher algorithm's block size.

   The CBC IV is XORed with the first plaintext block before it is
   encrypted.  Then, for successive blocks, the previous ciphertext
   block is XORed with the current plain text before it is encrypted.
   More information on CBC mode can be obtained in [6].

3.2.  Counter

   Camellia-CTR [15] requires the encryptor to generate a unique per-
   packet value, and communicate this value to the decryptor.  This
   specification calls this per-packet value an IV.  The same IV and key
   combination MUST NOT be used more than once.  The encryptor can
   generate the IV in any manner that ensures uniqueness.  Common
   approaches to IV generation include incrementing a counter for each
   packet and linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs).

   This specification calls for the use of a nonce for additional
   protection against precomputation attacks.  The nonce value need not
   to be secret.  However, the nonce MUST be unpredictable prior to the
   establishment of the IPsec Security Association (SA) using Camellia-
   CTR.

   Camellia-CTR has many properties that make it an attractive
   encryption algorithm for use in high-speed networking.  Camellia-CTR
   uses the Camellia block cipher to behave like a stream cipher.  Data
   is encrypted and decrypted by XORing with the key stream produced by
   Camellia encrypting sequential counter block values.  Camellia-CTR is
   easy to implement, and Camellia-CTR can be pipelined and
   parallelized.  Camellia-CTR also supports key stream precomputation.

   When used correctly, Camellia-CTR provides a high level of
   confidentiality.  Unfortunately, Camellia-CTR is easy to use

   incorrectly.  Being a stream cipher, any reuse of the per-packet
   value, called the IV, with the same nonce and key is catastrophic.  A
   counter block collision immediately leaks information about the
   plaintext in both packets.  For this reason, it is inappropriate to
   use this mode of operation with static keys.  Extraordinary measures
   would be needed to prevent reuse of an IV value with the static key
   across power cycles.  To be safe, implementations MUST use fresh keys
   with Camellia-CTR.  The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) [1] protocol
   can be used to establish fresh keys.  IKE can also provide the nonce
   value.

   With CTR mode, it is trivial to use a valid ciphertext to forge other
   (valid to the decryptor) ciphertexts.  Thus, it is equally
   catastrophic to use Camellia-CTR without a companion authentication
   function.  Implementations MUST use Camellia-CTR in conjunction with
   an authentication function, such as HMAC-SHA256 [16].

3.3.  Counter with CBC-MAC

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode.  In this
   specification, CCM is used with the Camellia [15] block cipher.

   Camellia-CCM [15] has two parameters:

   M  M indicates the size of the integrity check value (ICV).  CCM
      defines values of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 octets; However, to
      maintain alignment and provide adequate security, in IPsec ESP
      only the values 8, 12, and 16 are permitted.  Implementations MUST
      support M values of 8 octets and 16 octets, and implementations
      MAY support an M value of 12 octets.

   L  L indicates the size of the length field in octets.  CCM defines
      values of L from 2 to 8 octets.  This specification only supports
      L = 4 for use with ESP.  Implementations MUST support an L value
      of 4 octets, which accommodates a full Jumbogram [17]; however,
      the length includes all of the encrypted data, which also includes
      the ESP Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields.

   There are four inputs to CCM originator processing:

   key
      A single key is used to calculate the ICV using CBC-MAC and to
      perform payload encryption using CTR mode.  Camellia supports key
      sizes of 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  The default key size
      is 128 bits, and implementations MUST support this key size.
      Implementations MAY also support key sizes of 192 bits and 256
      bits.

Internet-Draft  Modes of Operation for Camellia for IPsec    August 2008


   nonce
      The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the
      parameter L. It is 15-L octets.  Implementations MUST support a
      nonce of 11 octets.  The construction of the nonce is described in
      Section 4.3.4.

   payload
      The payload of the ESP packet.  The payload MUST NOT be longer
      than 4,294,967,295 octets, which is the maximum size of a
      Jumbogram [17]; however, the ESP Padding, Pad Length, and Next
      Header fields are also part of the payload.

   AAD
      CCM provides data integrity and data origin authentication for
      some data outside the payload.  CCM does not allow additional
      authenticated data (AAD) to be longer than
      18,446,744,073,709,551,615 octets.  The ICV is computed from the
      ESP header, Payload, and ESP trailer fields, which is
      significantly smaller than the CCM-imposed limit.  The
      construction of the AAD is described in Section 4.3.5.

   Camellia-CCM requires the encryptor to generate a unique per-packet
   value and to communicate this value to the decryptor.  This per-
   packet value is one of the component parts of the nonce, and it is
   referred to as the IV.  The same IV and key combination MUST NOT be
   used more than once.  The encryptor can generate the IV in any manner
   that ensures uniqueness.  Common approaches to IV generation include
   incrementing a counter for each packet and LFSRs.

   Camellia-CCM employs CTR mode for encryption.  As with any stream
   cipher, reuse of the same IV value with the same key is catastrophic.
   A counter block collision immediately leaks information about the
   plaintext in both packets.  For this reason, it is inappropriate to
   use this CCM with statically configured keys.  Extraordinary measures
   would be needed to prevent reuse of an IV value with the static key
   across power cycles.  To be safe, implementations MUST use fresh keys
   with Camellia-CCM.  The IKEv2 protocol [1] can be used to establish
   fresh keys.

4.  ESP Payload

4.1.  Cipher Block Chaining

   The ESP payload for Camellia-CBC is made up of the IV followed by the
   ciphertext.  Thus, the payload field, as defined in [2], is broken
   down according to the following diagram:

      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
      |                                                               |
      +               Initialization Vector (16 octets)               +
      |                                                               |
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
      |                                                               |
      ~ Encrypted Payload (variable length, a multiple of 16 octets)  ~
      |                                                               |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+

             Figure 1: ESP Payload Encrypted with Camellia-CBC

   The IV field MUST be the same size as the block size of the cipher
   algorithm being used.  The IV MUST be chosen at random, and MUST be
   unpredictable.

   Including the IV in each datagram ensures that each received datagram
   can be decrypted, even when some datagrams are dropped or re-ordered
   in transit.

   To avoid CBC encryption of very similar plaintext blocks in different
   packets, implementations MUST NOT use a counter or other low Hamming-
   distance source for IVs.

4.1.1.  ESP Algorithmic Interactions

   Currently, there are no known issues regarding interactions between
   Camellia-CBC and other aspects of ESP, such as the use of certain
   authentication schemes.

4.2.  Counter

   The ESP payload for Camellia-CBC is made up of the IV followed by the
   ciphertext.  Figure 2 shows the format of the ESP Payload.

             Figure 2: ESP Payload Encrypted with Camellia-CTR

   Initialization Vector
      The Camellia-CTR IV field MUST be 8 octets.  The IV MUST be chosen
      by the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same IV value
      is used only once for a given key.  The encryptor can generate the
      IV in any manner that ensures uniqueness.  Common approaches to IV
      generation include incrementing a counter for each packet and
      LFSRs.  Including the IV in each packet ensures that the decryptor
      can generate the key stream needed for decryption, even when some
      packets are lost or reordered.

   Encrypted Payload
      The encrypted payload contains the ciphertext.  Camellia-CTR mode
      does not require plaintext padding.  However, ESP does require
      padding to 32-bit word-align the authentication data.  The
      padding, Pad Length, and the Next Header MUST be concatenated with
      the plaintext before performing encryption, as described in [2].

   Authentication Data
      Since it is trivial to construct a forgery Camellia-CTR ciphertext
      from a valid Camellia-CTR ciphertext, Camellia-CTR implementations
      MUST employ a non-NULL ESP authentication method.  HMAC-SHA256
      [16] is a likely choice.

4.2.1.  Counter Block Format

   The Camellia-CTR counter block is 128 bits.  Figure 3 shows the
   format of the counter block.

                      Figure 3: Counter Block Format

   The ESP payload fields with Camellia-CTR are as follows:

   Nonce
      The Nonce field is 32 bits.  As the name implies, the nonce is a
      single use value.  That is, a fresh nonce value MUST be assigned
      for each SA.  It MUST be assigned at the establishment of the SA.
      The nonce value needs not to be secret, but it MUST be
      unpredictable prior to the establishment of the SA.

   Initialization Vector
      The IV field is 64 bits.  As described in section 3.1, the IV MUST
      be chosen by the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same
      IV value is used only once for a given key.

   Block Counter
      The block counter field is the least significant 32 bits of the
      counter block.  The block counter begins with the value of one,
      and it is incremented to generate subsequent portions of the key
      stream.  The block counter is a 32-bit big-endian integer value.

   Using the encryption process described in Section 3.2, this
   construction permits each packet to consist of up to:

         (2^32)-1 blocks  =  4,294,967,295 blocks
                          = 68,719,476,720 octets

   This construction can produce enough key stream for each packet
   sufficient to handle any IPv6 jumbogram [17].

4.2.2.  Keying Material

   The minimum number of bits sent from the key exchange protocol to the
   ESP algorithm must be greater than or equal to the key size plus the
   Nonce size.

   The cipher's encryption and decryption key is taken from the first
   128, 192, or 256 bits of the keying material.  The Nonce is taken
   from the next 32 bits of the keying material.

4.3.  Counter with CBC-MAC

   The ESP payload is composed of the IV followed by the ciphertext.
   The payload field, as defined in [2], is structured as shown in
   Figure 4.

             Figure 4: ESP Payload Encrypted with Camellia-CCM

4.3.1.  Initialization Vector

   The Camellia-CCM IV field MUST be 8 octets.  The IV MUST be chosen by
   the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same IV value is used
   only once for a given key.  The encryptor can generate the IV in any
   manner that ensures uniqueness.  Common approaches to IV generation
   include incrementing a counter for each packet and LFSRs.

   Including the IV in each packet ensures that the decryptor can
   generate the key stream needed for decryption, even when some
   datagrams are lost or reordered.

4.3.2.  Encrypted Payload

   The encrypted payload contains the ciphertext.

   Camellia-CCM does not require plaintext padding.  However, ESP does
   require padding to 32-bit word-align the authentication data.  The
   Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields MUST be concatenated with
   the plaintext before performing encryption, as described in [2].
   When padding is required, it MUST be generated and checked in

   accordance with the conventions specified in [2].

4.3.3.  Authentication Data

   Camellia-CCM provides an encrypted ICV.  The ICV provided by CCM is
   carried in the Authentication Data field without further encryption.
   Implementations MUST support ICV sizes of 8 octets and 16 octets.
   Implementations MAY also support a 12-octet ICV.

4.3.4.  Nonce Format

   Each packet conveys the IV that is necessary to construct the
   sequence of counter blocks used by CTR mode to generate the key
   stream.  The Camellia counter block is 16 octets.  One octet is used
   for the CCM Flags, and 4 octets are used for the block counter, as
   specified by the CCM L parameter.  The remaining octets are the
   nonce.  These octets occupy the second through the twelfth octets in
   the counter block.  Figure 5 shows the format of the nonce.

        0                   1                   2                   3

                       Figure 5: Nonce Format of CCM

   The components of the nonce are as follows:

   Salt
      The salt field is 24 bits.  As the name implies, it contains an
      unpredictable value.  That is, a fresh salt value MUST be assigned
      for each SA.  It MUST be assigned at the establishment of the SA.
      The salt value needs not to be secret, but it MUST NOT be
      predictable prior to the establishment of the SA.

   Initialization Vector
      The IV field is 64 bits.  As described in Section 3.1, the IV MUST
      be chosen by the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same
      IV value is used only once for a given key.

   This construction permits each packet to consist of up to:

            2^32 blocks  =  4,294,967,296 blocks

                         = 68,719,476,736 octets

   This construction provides more key stream for each packet than is
   needed to handle any IPv6 Jumbogram [17].

4.3.5.  AAD Construction

   The data integrity and data origin authentication for the Security
   Parameters Index (SPI) and (Extended) Sequence Number fields is
   provided without encrypting them.  Two formats are defined: one for
   32-bit sequence numbers and one for 64-bit extended sequence numbers.
   The format with 32-bit sequence numbers is shown in Figure 6, and the
   format with 64-bit extended sequence numbers is shown in Figure 7.

   Sequence Numbers are conveyed in network byte order.  (Network byte
   order is fully described in Appendix B of RFC 791).

5.  IKEv2 Conventions

   This section describes the transform ID and conventions used to
   generate keying material for use with ENCR_CAMELLIA_CBC,
   ENCR_CAMELLIA_CTR and ENCR_CAMELLIA_CCM using the Internet Key
   Exchange (IKEv2) [1].

5.1.  Keying Material

   The size of KEYMAT MUST be equal or longer than the associated
   Camellia key.  The keying material is used as follows:

   Camellia-CBC with a 128-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is 16 octets.  The
      whole octets are the 128-bit Camellia key.

   Camellia-CBC with a 192-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is 24 octets.  The
      whole octets are the 192-bit Camellia key.

   Camellia-CBC with a 256-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is 32 octets.  The
      whole octets are the 256-bit Camellia key.

   Camellia-CTR with a 128-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR key is 20 octets.  The
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CTR with a 192-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR key is 28 octets.  The
      first 24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CTR with a 256-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR key is 36 octets.  The
      first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CCM with a 128-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 19 octets.  The
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      three octets are used as the salt value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CCM with a 192-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 27 octets.  The
      first 24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      three octets are used as the salt value in the counter block.

Internet-Draft  Modes of Operation for Camellia for IPsec    August 2008


   Camellia-CCM with a 256-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 35 octets.  The
      first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      three octets are used as the salt value in the counter block.

5.2.  Transform Type 1

   For IKEv2 negotiations, IANA has assigned five ESP Transform
   Identifiers for Camellia-CBC, Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM.

         <TBD1> for Camellia-CBC with explicit IV;
         <TBD2> for Camellia-CTR with explicit IV;
         <TBD3> for Camellia-CCM with an 8-octet ICV;
         <TBD4> for Camellia-CCM with a 12-octet ICV; and
         <TBD5> for Camellia-CCM with a 16-octet ICV.

5.3.  Key Length Attribute

   Since Camellia supports three key lengths, the Key Length attribute
   MUST be specified in the IKE exchange [1].  The Key Length attribute
   MUST have a value of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

6.  Security Considerations

   Implementations are encouraged to use the largest key sizes they can,
   taking into account performance considerations for their particular
   hardware and software configuration.  Note that encryption
   necessarily affects both sides of a secure channel, so such
   consideration must take into account not only the client side, but
   also the server.  However, a key size of 128 bits is considered
   secure for the foreseeable future.

   Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM employ CTR mode for confidentiality.
   If a counter block value is ever used for more that one packet with
   the same key, then the same key stream will be used to encrypt both
   packets, and the confidentiality guarantees are voided.

   What happens if the encryptor XORs the same key stream with two
   different packet plaintexts?  Suppose two packets are defined by two
   plaintext byte sequences P_1, P_2, P_3 and Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, then both
   are encrypted with key stream K_1, K_2, K_3.  The two corresponding
   ciphertexts are:

         (P_1 XOR K_1), (P_2 XOR K_2), (P_3 XOR K_3)

         (Q_1 XOR K_1), (Q_2 XOR K_2), (Q_3 XOR K_3)


   If both of these two ciphertexts streams are exposed to an attacker,
   then a catastrophic failure of confidentiality results, because:

         (P_1 XOR K_1) XOR (Q_1 XOR K_1) = P1 XOR Q1
         (P_2 XOR K_2) XOR (Q_2 XOR K_2) = P2 XOR Q2
         (P_3 XOR K_3) XOR (Q_3 XOR K_3) = P3 XOR Q3

   Once the attacker obtains the two plaintexts XORed together, it is
   relatively straightforward to separate them.  Thus, using any stream
   cipher, including Camellia-CTR, to encrypt two plaintexts under the
   same key stream leaks the plaintext.

   Therefore, Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM should not be used with
   statically configured keys.  Extraordinary measures would be needed
   to prevent the reuse of a counter block value with the static key
   across power cycles.  To be safe, implementations MUST use fresh keys
   with Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM.  The IKEv2 [1] protocol can be
   used to establish fresh keys.

   When IKE is used to establish fresh keys between two peer entities,
   separate keys are established for the two traffic flows.  If a
   different mechanism is used to establish fresh keys, one that

Internet-Draft  Modes of Operation for Camellia for IPsec    August 2008


   establishes only a single key to encrypt packets, then there is a
   high probability that the peers will select the same IV values for
   some packets.  Thus, to avoid counter block collisions, ESP
   implementations that permit use of the same key for encrypting and
   decrypting packets with the same peer MUST ensure that the two peers
   assign different salt values to the SA.

   Regardless of the mode used, Camellia with a 128-bit key is
   vulnerable to the birthday attack after 2^64 blocks are encrypted
   with a single key.  Since ESP with Extended Sequence Numbers allows
   for up to 2^64 packets in a single SA, there is real potential for
   more than 2^64 blocks to be encrypted with one key.  Implementations
   SHOULD generate a fresh key before 2^64 blocks are encrypted with the
   same key.  Note that ESP with 32-bit Sequence Numbers will not exceed
   2^64 blocks even if all of the packets are maximum-length Jumbograms.

   No security problem has been found for Camellia [12], [11].
