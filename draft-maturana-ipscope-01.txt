1.  Introduction

   This document defines four scope modifiers to be used in intellectual
   property declarations of resources available in interoperable
   environments, such as Internet.  They help to abstract the ownership
   behavior of these resources.

   We proceed in three steps.  We characterize the semantic of the
   operations applicable on ressources, based on the pair (URI,
   ownership).  Then we determine the modifiers which controls the
   interoperability of resources.  Finally we describe the general
   syntax of the ownership declarations that use these modifiers.

   Four modifiers are defined.  The PUBLIC, PROTECTED and PRIVATE
   modifiers are transpositions of the class programming equivalents.  A
   fourth modifier -- the INTERNET modifier --  works as a no-country
   restriction: it allows the transformation, but does not allow the
   reproduction, of a private resource exhibited in interoperable
   environnments, such as Internet.

   As an exemple, the following declaration illustrates a typical usage
   of the PUBLIC and PRIVATE modifiers.  This declaration asserts that
   OwnerB's private resource (the client resource) is a derivative
   version of OwnerA's public resource (the server resource).

       Private(C) 2004, OwnerB (http://www.client.com)
       & Public(C) 2002-2004, OwnerA (http://www.server.com)
       All rights reserved.


1.1  Intended audience

   No special knowledge is expected from readers.  However, some
   concepts have a background and rely on a vocabulary that is more
   familiar to specialized readers:
   o  Intellectual property rights, as defined for protected works by
      the Berne Convention [BERNE].
   o  Class modifiers such as Public, Private and Protected, as defined
      in Class programming languages; [CPPREF]

1.2  Definitions

   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASED OBJECT (IP OBJECT) is an instance of a
   work, as defined by Berne Convention (Art.  2), and the laws of the
   countries of the Berne Union [BERNE].

   RESOURCE is an IP Object defined unambiguously in an interoperable
   environnment by two properties: an URI and an ownership declaration.

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   More strictly, a resource is an interface defined by the pair (URI,
   ownership) to an IP object available in an interoperable universe

   OWNERSHIP is a resource property, defined by Berne Convention (Art.
   5), and the laws of the countries of the Berne Union [
BERNE].

   URI is a resource property, the Universal Resource Identifier of an
   IP object, defined in [RFC2396].

   SCOPE (OF OWNERSHIP), as used in this document, determines the
   resource behavior in regard of specific operations: exhibition
   (instantiation), execution (performance), reproduction (copy) and
   transformation (derivation).

   SCOPE MODIFIER, is a conventional token attached to an ownership
   declaration, used to alter the behavior of the resource in an
   interoperable environnment.
   The aim of this document is to define and to describe such scope
   modifiers.

   SERVER and CLIENT RESOURCES.  A server resource refers to the
   original resource, which has been reproduced or transformed, to
   create a client resource.
   A client resource is the resulting reproduction or transformation of
   a server resource.
   A version is a client resource, but it designates specifically the
   result of the transformation.

   INTEROPERABILITY is defined as in the IEEE Standard Computer
   Dictionary [IEEE 90].

   INTERNET, is an interoperable environment of resources.
   In this document, INTERNET is also the conventional name of a scope
   modifier.

1.3  Requirement notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Semantics of interoperability

   This first chapter will analyze the semantic of the operations
   applicable on ressources.  Next chapter defines    the scope
   modifiers that alter the behavior of resources; and the last chapter
   describes the general syntax of the ownership declarations.

2.1  An analogy: the logic of classes

   As a starting point, we present an analogy between Resources
   declarations and Class declarations used in class programming
   languages.  This analogy   is not required to understand this
   document.

   Given the "(C) year, author" expression, the legal mention to the
   Country is implicit.  Indeed, we could write:

           "France (C) 2004, I.Robredo"

   In our example, "Country" is a virtual base class, from which we
   derive a special rightsholder class: the class "I.Robredo".  Each
   instance of this Rightsholder class is a concrete IP Object,
   identified unambiguously by an URI.  For example, the URI of a
   manuscript or a song is the title, the author's name and the date.

   The declaration above may be read as follow:

        "France (C) 2004, I.Robredo"

        Is an ownership declaration of an IP object, where:

           France      is the name of the virtual, country base class.
                       Optional. By default, the auhtor's country.

           I.Robredo   is the name of the rightsholder class,
                       derived
                       from the country class (usually the Author's
                       name, but it is not required).

           ... 2004    is an instance of the I.Robredo class. The
                       IP object itself is defined by the 2004 version
                       (along with the title, the author's name, ...).


   An ownership declaration is used when the rigthsholder wants to make
   available an IP Objet in an interoperable environnment, under
   specific conditions of ownership.  This object is called a resource,
   and two properties determines its behavior in the environnment: an

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   URI and a ownership d‰claration.

   Before being available, the resource is unknown and the ownership
   declaration is not even required.  This declaration is really
   required to allow some interoperations on the resource.  In other
   words, the ownership   declaration is used to determine or alter the
   interoperability  properties of the resource.

   In Class programming languages, special modifiers attached to Class
   declarations are used to determine the results of operations on the
   classes and on the object instances.  In other words, these modifiers
   can define the semantics of the relations between classes or between
   objets.  This document shows that similar conventions can be applied
   to the resources exhibited in interoperable environnments, such as
   the Internet.

2.2  Categories of operations

   A resource is defined by a couple of properties: URI and ownership.

   Some relations may be identified between these properties:
   o  The same URI cannot point resources from different rightsholders.
   o  Two URIs may point to either the same or duplicated resources.
   o  Different righstholders cannot control the same URI.

   We resume these logical relations by two questions.  For any
   operation:
   o  Will the operation on resource create a second URI?
   o  Who is the rightsholder of the client resource, if created?

   Four operations are defined as follows (alias names are parenthized):

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


     EXHIBITION  (Instantiation) The Owner instantiates an IP Object
                 by defining its URI and ownership properties.
                 Exhibition of the resource is always accomplished by
                 the rightsholder (for example: the author).

     EXECUTION   (Performance) There is no URI creation. A volatile
                 instance of the IP Object is performed.
                 Whether the performer
                 is the rihgtsholder or another different person, the
                 ownership of this volatile resource remains the
                 same, and belongs to the original rightsholder.

     REPRODUCTION (Copy) A new, persistent URI is created, and the
                 resource exhibited under this new URI is called a
                 "client resource".
                 Whether the underlying object under both URI
                 is the same or a duplicate, the ownership of
                 both server an client resources remains to the same,
                 and belongs to the original rightsholder.

     TRANSFORMATION (Derivation) A new, persistent client resource
                 is created, with a separate property pair (URI,
                 ownership). This client resource is called
                 a "version" of the original server resource.
                 Even whether the rightsholder of both server
                 and client resources is the same person, the
                 ownership attached to the version resource is
                 different from the ownership of the original resource.
                 The ownership declaration on the version is asserted
                 by the exhibitor of the resource.


2.3  Reciprocity and equivalence

   This section is not required to understand this document, and it
   refers explicitely to the 5 first articles of the Berne Convention.
   [BERNE].

   The exhibition and execution operations require some explanations.
   o  Exhibition is a pragmatic equivalent of the verb "creation", which
      is not defined by itself, but it is implied by Berne-A2.2, as a
      work fixed in a form.  Whether a work is published or not
      (Berne-A3,1a), it can be exhibited.
      The word exhibition is a shorthand to describe the instantiation
      of a resource under 2 coordinates: its URI and its ownership
      declaration.  When an IP object is instantiated under the pair
      (URI, ownership declaration), this object becomes accessible and
      it is possible to inter-operate with it.

    [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   o  Execution is a synonym for performance, which is not defined by
      itself, but it is implied by Berne-A3,3: the performance of a
      protected work shall not constitute publication.  We choose the
      word "execution" because it is typically used to describe software
      execution, but it could be used for the recitation of a poetry, or
      to describe the application of this document on Internet resources
      as well.

   Otherness is the key concept to differentiate these two operations:
   the person who executes a resource is not required to be the same
   person who exhibits it.  The exhibitor and the performer of the work
   can be different persons.  For example, given a computer software, we
   say that only the rightsholder can exhibit the source code, while any
   (authorized) person can execute the object code.

   The otherness concept is the basis of two complementary principles:
   reciprocity (Berne-A3 and A5) and equivalence (Berne A2.3) of server
   and client resources.  The only restriction is the potential
   prejudice to the server ownership.
   By definition, the application of these principles is associative,
   and they determines a "follow-up" mechanism of interoperability.  In
   other words, provided that the client and server resources are
   mutually recognized by its rightsholders, the capabilities of both
   client and server are supposed to be equivalent.

   For example, if the source code is exhibited, any reproduction or
   transformation must be exhibited as well, under a different URI, or
   not exhibited at all.
   Similar behavior happens when the ownership are different: allowing
   the transformation of a server resource implies that the client
   resource can be transformed as well.  For reproduction, however, the
   potential prejudice to the original owner is typically invoked to
   restrict this follow-up mechanism.

   This follow-up mechanism determines the rules of inheritance of scope
   modifiers.

3.  Definition of scope modifiers

   In the previous chapter, we analyzed the semantics of
   inter-operations on resources defined by the pair (URI, ownership).
   In this chapter, we define the modifiers which are used to alter the
   resource behaviors.  The general syntax of the ownership declarations
   will be described in the next chapter.

   The comparison of relations between URI and ownership is resumed in
   the following table:


        Operation         | Second URI  Separate
                          | Creation    ownership
        ------------------|--------------------------------
        EXHIBITION        |  No         No
        EXECUTION         |  No         No
                          |
        REPRODUCTION      |  Yes        No
        TRANSFORMATION    |  Yes        Yes
        ----------------------------------------------

   We then extract the second-URI based operations to create the logical
   table of REPRODUCTION and TRANSFORMATION capabilities.  Each entry
   corresponds to four scope modifiers, as shown by the following table:

     If EXECUTION is allowed and you allow...

             REPRODUCTION  TRANSFORMATION | SCOPE is
         ------------------------------------------------
              No            No            |  PRIVATE
              Yes           No            |  PROTECTED
              No            Yes           |  INTERNET
              Yes           Yes           |  PUBLIC
         ------------------------------------------------

   The following table is the same than above, but it is possible to
   read it out in a more natural way.
   The symbols '-' and '+' mean that the operation is denied, or
   allowed, respectively.  The symbol '-' can be read like 'not', while
   the symbol '+' correspond to a silence.

         The resource is | When the resource can be
         ------------------------------------------------
          PRIVATE        | -REPRODUCED and -TRANSFORMED
          PROTECTED      | +REPRODUCED but -TRANSFORMED
          INTERNET       | -REPRODUCED but +TRANSFORMED
          PUBLIC         | +REPRODUCED and +TRANSFORMED

         ------------------------------------------------

    This table shows clearly that the space allocated to the INTERNET
   modifier in the semantics of the interoperability is a logical
   imperative.

3.1  PRIVATE modifier

   The PRIVATE modifier means that no secondary URI, and no separate
   Ownershipis allowed for the resource.  No reproduction, and no
   transformation is allowed.

   By default, the exhibition and the execution of a PRIVATE resource is
   restricted to the rightsholder.

3.2  PROTECTED modifier

   The PROTECTED modifier means that the reproduction of the resource is
   allowed under a client URI, but no separate Ownership is granted.
   Reproduction is allowed, but transformation is forbiden.

   The client resource inherits the same scope than server.  By default,
   it is posible make news reproductions of the client resource.

   A protected resource is typically managed with a license.  For
   example, a license can be used in a collective project which
   encourages the reproduction of the work.  A protected license can
   even create a "mixed scope", by allowing some transformations
   capabilities to resources.

3.3  INTERNET modifier

   The INTERNET modifier means that the transformation of the resource
   is allowed,  but its reproduction is forbiden.

   The INTERNET modifier can be defined as a "country excluder".  This
   exclusion rationale highlihgts the fact that the server resource
   appears just like a private resource under the laws of all countries.
   In other words, the client version cannot be reproduced in no
   country, and its ownership is only recognized by the original
   rightsholder.

   However, a separate ownership exists and the client version inherits
   the same scope than the server resource.  For example, it is not
   possible (even to the original rightsholder) to reproduce the
   transformed version in no country.

   Conceptually, we recall that the traditional ownership is grounded on



Maturana & Robredo     Expires December 30, 2004               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   the country laws.  The Internet scope modifier shows that the
   ownership can be directly enforced by the good will of individuals.
   Under this scope, the reciprocal and equivalent ownership of
   resources is enforced by the otherness of the persons, rather than of
   the countries.

   To resume, the Internet scope has three characteristics:
   o  Regarding the country laws, an Internet server resource works just
      like a PRIVATE resource, with the exception that it is possible to
      create new versions from it.  However, by default no reproduction
      and no execution of these versions are allowed in no country.
   o  Any version SHALL inherit the INTERNET modifier.  The modifier has
      equivalent capabilities than the server resource (section 2.3).
      In other words, multiple versions of the same Internet resource
      can be exhibited by different rightsholders.
   o  All Internet versions SHALL refer, directly or indirectly, to an
      original server resource.  Any operation on a client version
      resource (even its exhibition or execution) may ultimately
      requires the authorization of the original rightsholder.

   The internet resource can be also managed by a license.  for example,
   to authorize the reproduction  of a specific version, based on t
he
   polling of readers.

   Without the INTERNET scope modifier, it would be impossible to
   understand the widest part of the behavior of resources in
   interoperable environnements, such as Internet.

3.4  PUBLIC modifier

   The PUBLIC means that the reproduction and transformation of the
   resource is allowed under a client URI, and a separate Ownership is
   recognized.

   The client resource inherits the same scope than server.  By default,
   the client resource is public.

   PUBLIC scope must not be confused with "public domain".  The
   rightsholder of the public resource keeps the full control on the
   resource.

3.5  Scope inheritance

   The rule of scope inheritance is described in the following table.

   Given 2 resources, server and client, the scope modifier of the
   client declaration SHALL be either the same or a more restrictive

   Notes:
   o  Internet and public client resources can degrade to private
      because they recognize a separate ownership.
   o  In theory, and internet client resource could allow the
      reproduction, without prejudice to the server ownership (Berne
      A-2.2 [BERNE]).  In practice,  allowing the reproduction of a
      client version requires an explicit grant from the original
      rightsholder.
   o  The client of a public resource can freely degrade to any scope.
      This is done without prejudice to server rightsholder, who has
      explicitely allowed the transformation and the reproduction of the
      client resources.

   This document does not define precedence rules for scope modifiers.

4.  Syntax of ownership declarations

   In previous chapters, we analyzed the semantics of interoperability,
   then we defined four scope modifiers for ownership declarations.
   This chapter describes the RECOMMENDED syntax of such declarations.

4.1  Formal declaration

   The formal declaration is a multiline text defined as server or
   client declaration.

   The syntax is based on three possible line types.

   o  Property line.  MUST appear.  It contains the rightsholder's
      declaration of the resource.
   o  Attribution line(s).  SHALL appear in client resource
      declarations.  It refers to the rightsholder's declaration of a
      server resource.
   o  License line.  Optional.  Free text or link that defines specific
      conditions of ownership.

   A server declaration contains a Property line and optionnaly, a
   License line:

      [modifier](C) [date][owner]              (Property line)
      [standard assertion or license link]     (License line)

    A client declaration contains the same lines than the server
   delcaration, plus one or more attribution lines:

      [modifier](C) [date][owner]              (Property line)
      & [modifier](C) [date][owner]            (Attribution line)
      [standard assertion or license link]     (License line)

   Here is an example of a Internet client declaration:

       Internet(C) 2004, ClientOwner (client-owner@clientsite.com)
       & Internet(C) 2004, ServerOwner (server-owner@serversite.com)
       All rights reserved in all countries.


4.2  Property line

   Property line MUST appear for all modifiers.  The Property line is
   composed of:
   o  The scope modifier, from the list:  Private, Protected, Public,
      Internet.

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   o  The (C) symbol.  This symbol may be entered as a parenthized C,
      uppercase or lowercase.
   o  The Date of first exhibition, oftentimes followed by the date of
      the last update
   o  The Name of the resource rightsholder
   o  Any optional information, as the resource URL or the author's
      email address.

               Modifier                 Scope
               -------------------------------------
               (none)                  PRIVATE
               [Private](C)            PRIVATE
               Protected(C)            PROTECTED
               Public(C)               PUBLIC
               Internet(C)             INTERNET
               -------------------------------------

   In a compliant declaration, the (C) symbol MUST follow the scope
   modifier.  The (C) symbol MUST appears even if no modifier is used or
   it is not required by the Country Law.

   Two examples:

       Internet(C) 2004, OwnerName (owner-x@somesite.com)

       Public(C) 2002-2004, OwnerName (owner-x@somesite.com)


4.3  Attribution line

   The Attribution line SHALL be used in an ownership declaration when
   the resource is a transformed version of the original or when
   multiple rightsholders share different rights on it.

   The use of an AMPERSAND sign ('&') in front of Attribution line is
   RECOMMENDED.

   The syntax of Attribution line is otherwise similar to the Property
   line.  For example:

       Internet(C) 2004, OwnerC (http://www.clientC.com)
       & Internet(C) 2002-2004, OwnerB (http://www.client_server.com)
       & Public(C) 2002, OwnerA (http://www.server.org)

   When multiple server resources have been used, or because there are
   multiple rightsholders, the ownership declaration may contains
   multiple attribution lines.  For example:

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004

      & [modifier](C) [date][Worldwide Rightsholder for all languages]
      & [modifier](C) [date][Author who sold the original rights]
      [standard assertion or license link]


4.4  License line

   License line is OPTIONAL and may be used with any modifier to
   override the default behavior of the resource.

   The license line may be multiline and MUST close the ownership
   declaration, after the Property line and the Attribution line(s).

   The license line is a free text that usually rely on conventional
   expressions, as used in the country of the protected resource.

       Private(C) 2004, Owner (http://www.clienttranslation.com)
       All rights reserved

    Here is an other example in French.

       Internet(C) 2004, NomDuClient (http://www.client.fr)
       & Internet(C) 2002-2004, NomDuServeur (http://www.serveur.ca)
       Reproduction interdite

   The license line may refer to a license identified with a separate
   URI.

       Internet(C) 2004, OwnerX (owner-x@somesite.com)
       LGTv1r4: http://www.in3activa.org

5.  Scope modifiers implementation

   After we analyzed the semantics of the interoperability of resources
   based on the pair (URI,ownership), we determined four scope
   modifiers, and proposed a recommended syntax to use the ownership
   declarations.

   As a conclusion to this specification, this
 chapter describes three
   compliant implementations of the scope modifiers.

5.1  Handwritten implementation: the defaut modifier

   The handwritten implementation matches the syntax specification of
   scope modifiers.  For a complete handwritten implementation, please
   read the the previous chapter description.

   However, to follow the common usage in the countries of Berne Union,
   a compliant handwritten implementation SHALL consider the PRIVATE
   modifier as the default modifier.

   The following declaration :

       (C) 2004, RightsHolder ..

   will be interpreted as:

       Private(C) 2004, RightsHolder ...


5.2  HTML implementation: the SCOPE tag

   Scope modifiers are well-suited for automated processing by robots,
   and for dissemination of resources in the internet.  Among the many
   possibilities, we only define the HTML implementation [HTML40],
   because it can be easily adapter to other specifications (XML, RDF,
   etc).

   The RECOMMENDED implementation of this framework with the HTML 4.0
   langage MUST include:
   o  A SCOPE meta tag in the HEAD section, which defines the default
      scope of the resource.
   o  Optionally, one or more scope tags in the body, which override the
      default scope defined in the header.

   The following example describes an protected HTML resource:






Maturana & Robredo     Expires December 30, 2004               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


          <html>
          <head>
           ...
          <meta name  = "scope"
               content   = "internet" >
           ...
          </head>
          <body><pre>
             ...
          </pre></body>
          </html>

   The content attribute defines the default scope of the resource.
   This default scope may be overriden by HTML body tags that define
   specific content boundaries.

   In the following example, we defines a public portion inside the
   default internet scope of the resource.  The two syntax are allowed
   and MUST be recognized by automatic processing:

          <scope content="public"> ... <scope>
     or
          <scope public> ... <scope>


5.3  Dublin Core implementation

   The Dublin Core specification offers a richer layout for scope
   modifiers.  This section describes a possible addition of scope
   modifier to the Dublin core specification [RFC2731].

   The addition is based on a new SCOPE element, to be used along with
   the already defined Rights Element:

         <html>
          <head>
          <title>Le ravissement d'Europe</title>
          <link rel     = "schema.DC"
                href    = "http://purl.org/DC/elements/1.0/">
          <meta name    = "DC.Title"
                content = "Charte in3ActivA de traducteurs...">
          <meta name    = "DC.Creator"
                content = "Robredo, I">
          <meta name    = "DC.Type"
                content = "Contrat">
          <meta name    = "DC.Date"
                content = "2004">
          <meta name    = "DC.Format"
                content = "text/html">
          <meta name    = "DC.Language"
                content = "fr">


          <meta name = "DC.Rights"
                lang   = "fr"
                content= "http://www.in3activa.org/doc/fr/LGT-FR.html">

          <meta name = "DC.Scope"
                content= "Internet">

          </head>
          <body><pre>
             ...
          </pre></body>
          </html>

    This Dublin Core example would imply the following handwritten
   declaration at the end of the resource:

       internet(C) 2004, I.Robredo
       http://www.in3activa.org/doc/fr/LGT-FR.html


5.4  Using licenses

   The scope modifiers provides a powerful, although generic, framework
   for resources.  To enlarge or restrict the scope of the resource
   ownership, the rightsholders may define a license and override the
   default behavior of scope modifiers.

   For example, a license may override the protected scope of software
   resource, and authorize its transformation under specifics

   conditions.

   Conversely, the license of an internet resource can be provided to
   authorize the reproduction in the country of the licensee.  For
   example, the license attached to an internet resource may allow a
   book reproduction to be sold in specific countries, without prejudice
   to the original ownership.

       (C) 2004, I.Maturana for the Spanish version
       &Internet (C) 1999-2004, I.Robredo
       http://www.in3activa.org/doc/fr/LGT-FR.html

   The framework provided by scope modifiers introduces the opportunity
   for rightsholders to create and develop powerful licenses schemas,
   based on the analysis and the simulation of resource behaviors, in
   interoperable environnments, including the Internet.
