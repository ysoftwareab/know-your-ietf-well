                     draft-ietf-lamps-ocsp-nonce-05

Abstract

   This document specifies the updated format of the Nonce extension in
   the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) request and response
   messages.  OCSP is used to check the status of a certificate and the
   Nonce extension is used to cryptographically bind an OCSP response
   message to a particular OCSP request message.  This document updates
   RFC 6960.

1.  Introduction

   This document updates the usage and format of the Nonce extension
   used in OCSP request and response messages.  This extension was
   previously defined in section 4.4.1 of [RFC6960].  [RFC6960] does not
   mention any minimum and maximum length of nonce in the Nonce
   extension.  Lacking limits on the length of nonce in the Nonce
   extension, an OCSP responders that follow [RFC6960] may be vulnerable
   to various attacks like Denial of Service attacks [RFC4732], chosen
   prefix attacks to get a desired signature, and possible evasions
   using the Nonce extension data.  This document specifies a lower
   limit of 1 and an upper limit of 32 to the length of nonce in the
   Nonce extension.  This document updates [RFC6960].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  OCSP Extensions

   The message format for OCSP request and response is defined in
   [RFC6960].  [RFC6960] also defines the standard extensions for OCSP
   messages based on the extension model employed in X.509 version 3

   certificates (see [RFC5280]).  This document only specifies the new
   format for Nonce extension and does not change specification of any
   of the other standard extensions defined in [RFC6960].

2.1.  Nonce Extension

   This section replaces the entirety of the Section 4.4.1 of [RFC6960]
   which describes the OCSP Nonce extension.

   The nonce cryptographically binds a request and a response to prevent
   replay attacks.  The nonce is included as one of the
   requestExtensions in requests, while in responses it would be
   included as one of the responseExtensions.  In both the request and
   the response, the nonce will be identified by the object identifier
   id-pkix-ocsp-nonce, while the extnValue is the value of the nonce.
   If Nonce extension is present then the length of nonce MUST be at
   least 1 octet and can be up to 32 octets.

   A server MUST reject any OCSP request having a nonce in the Nonce
   extension with length of 0 octets or more than 32 octets with the
   malformedRequest OCSPResponseStatus as described in section 4.2.1 of
   [RFC6960].

   The value of the nonce MUST be generated using a cryptographically
   strong pseudorandom number generator (see [RFC4086]).  The minimum
   nonce length of 1 octet is defined to provide backward compatibility
   with older clients that follow [RFC6960].  Newer OCSP clients that
   support this document MUST use a length of 32 octets for the nonce in
   Nonce extension.  OCSP responders MUST accept lengths of at least 16
   octets, and MAY choose to ignore the Nonce extension for requests
   where the length of the nonce is less than 16 octets

      id-pkix-ocsp           OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad-ocsp }
      id-pkix-ocsp-nonce     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp 2 }

      Nonce ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..32))

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of OCSP, in general, are described in
   [RFC6960].  During the interval in which the previous OCSP response
   for a certificate is not expired but the responder has a changed
   status for that certificate, a copy of that OCSP response can be used
   to indicate that the status of the certificate is still valid.
   Including client's Nonce value in the OCSP response makes sure that
   the response is the latest response from the server and not an old
   copy.

Internet-Draft            OCSP Nonce Extension            September 2020


3.1.  Replay Attack

   The Nonce extension is used to avoid replay attacks.  Since the OCSP
   responder may choose to not send the Nonce extension in the OCSP
   response even if the client has sent the Nonce extension in the
   request [RFC5019], an on-path attacker can intercept the OCSP request
   and respond with an earlier response from the server without the
   Nonce extension.  This can be mitigated by configuring the server to
   use a short time interval between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate
   fields in the OCSP response.

3.2.  Nonce Collision

   If the value of nonce used by a client in OCSP request is
   predictable, then an attacker may prefetch responses with the
   predicted nonce and can replay them, thus defeating the purpose of
   using nonce.  Therefore the value of Nonce extension in the OCSP
   request MUST contain cryptographically strong randomness and MUST be
   freshly generated at the time of creating the OCSP request.  Also if
   the length of nonce is too small e.g. 1 octet then an on-path
   attacker can prefetch responses with all the possible values of nonce
   and replay a matching nonce.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not call for any IANA actions.

5.  Changes to Appendix B. of RFC 6960

   This section updates the ASN.1 definitions of the OCSP Nonce
   extension in Appendix B.1 and Appendix B.2 of [RFC6960] The
   Appendix B.1 defines OCSP using ASN.1 - 1998 Syntax and Appendix B.2
   defines OCSP using ASN.1 - 2008 Syntax

5.1.  Changes to Appendix B.1.  OCSP in ASN.1 - 1998 Syntax

   OLD Syntax:

   The definition of OCSP Nonce Extension is not provided in
   Appendix B.1 of [RFC6960] for the ASN.1 - 1998 Syntax.

   NEW Syntax:

       Nonce ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..32))

5.2.  Changes to Appendix B.2 OCSP in ASN.1 - 2008 Syntax

   OLD Syntax:

       re-ocsp-nonce EXTENSION ::= { SYNTAX OCTET STRING IDENTIFIED
           BY id-pkix-ocsp-nonce }


   NEW Syntax:

       re-ocsp-nonce EXTENSION ::= { SYNTAX OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..32))
