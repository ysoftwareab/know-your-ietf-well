Abstract  
 
  This document describes the preferred designs of the PWE3 Control 
  Word, and the PWE3 Payload Type Identifier. The design of these 
  fields is chosen so that an MPLS LSR performing deep packet 
  inspection will not confuse a PWE3 payload with an IP payload.

Conventions used in this document  
     
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

 
1.   Introduction 

  Packets are carried in MPLS label stacks without any protocol 
  identifier. In order for a pseudo wire (PW) [ARCH] to operate 
  correctly over an MPLS PSN that performs deep packet inspection, a 
  PW packet must not appear to the LSR as if it were an IP packet 
  [BCP]. An example of an LSR that performs deep packet inspection is 
  one that is performing equal-cost multiple-path load-balancing 
  (ECMP) [RFC2992]. If ECMP were performed on PWE3 packets, the 
  packets in the PW may not all follow the same path though the PSN. 
  This may result in misordered packet deliver to the egress PE. The 
  inability to ensure that all packets belonging to a PW follow the 
  same path also prevents the PW OAM [VCCV] mechanism from correctly 
  monitoring the PW.  

  This draft specifies how a PW Control Word distinguishes a PW MPLS 
  payload from an IP MPLS payload. 

2.   PWE3 Packet Identification 

  All IP packets [RFC791][RFC1883] start with a version number which 
  is checked by LSRs performing packet inspection. Therefore, PWE3 
  packets carried over an MPLS PSN SHOULD NOT start with the value 4 
  or the value 6 in the first nibble [BCP]. 

  A PW SHOULD employ either the generic PW Control Word described in 
  Section 3, or the PWE3 Payload Type Identifier (PWE3-PTI) described 
  in Section 4. These fields MUST immediately follow the bottom of the 
  MPLS label stack. 

  If the first nibble of a PWE3 packet carried over an MPLS PSN has a 
  value of 0, it starts with a Generic PW Control Word. If the first 
  nibble of a packet carried over an MPLS PSN has a value of 1, it 
  starts with a Payload Type Identifier. The use of any other first 
  nibble value for a PWE3 packet is deprecated. 

3.   Generic PW Control Word 

  The Generic PW Control Word is shown in Figure 1.

  The PW set-up protocol or configuration mechanism determines whether 
  a PW uses a Control Word. Bits 0..3 differ from the first four bits 
  of an IP packet [BCP] and hence provide the necessary MPLS payload 
  discrimination. 

  When a Control Word is used, it SHOULD have the following preferred 
  form: 

 
   0                   1                   2                   3

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       Figure 2: MPLS Preferred Control Word 

  The meaning of the fields of the MPLS Preferred Control Word (Figure 
  2) are as follows: 

  Flags (bits 4 to 7): 

         These bits are available for per payload signalling.  Their 
         definition is encapsulation specific. 

  FRG (bits 8 and 9): 

         These bits are used when fragmenting a PW payload. Their use 
         is defined in [FRAG].  When the PW is of a type that will 
         never need payload fragmentation, these bits may be used as 
         general purpose flags. 

  Length (bits 10 to 15): 

         The length field is used to determine the size of a PW 
         payload that might have been padded to the minimum Ethernet           
         MAC frame size during its transit across the PSN. If the          
         MPLS payload (defined as the CW + the PW payload + any           
         additional PW headers) is less than 46 bytes, the length MUST 
         be set to the length of the MPLS payload.  If the MPLS 
         payload is between 46 bytes and 63 bytes the implementation

INTERNET DRAFT            PWE3 Control Word                 July 2004 
 
         MAY either set to the length to the length of the MPLS 
         payload, or it MAY set it to 0.  If the length of the MPLS 
         payload is greater than 63 bytes the length MUST be set to 0. 

         [EditorÆs note: Both the MUSTs are needed to make the 
         mechanism work, the MAY is for backwards compatibility with 
         deployed systems] 

  Sequence number (Bit 16 to 31): 

         If the sequence number is not used, it is set to zero by the 
         sender and ignored by the receiver.  Otherwise it specifies 
         the sequence number of a packet.  A circular list of sequence 
         numbers is used.  A sequence number takes a value from 1 to 
         65535 (2**16-1). The sequence number window size for packet 
         acceptance is dependent on the parameters of the PSN, and 
         SHOULD be configurable. The mechanism used by the 
         decapsulating PE to (re)acquire the correct sequence number 
         is implementation dependent. 

         If the payload is an OAM packet the sequence number MAY be 
         used to mark the position in the sequence, in which case it 
         has the same value as the last data PDU sent.  The use of the 
         sequence number is optional for OAM payloads. 

4.   PWE3 Payload Type Identifier 

  If technical considerations result in a PW Control Word that could 
  be mistaken for an IP packet, the Control Word SHOULD be preceded by 
  a PWE3 Payload Type Identifier (PWE3-PTI). The PWE3-PTI is defined 
  follows: 

  0                   1                   2                   3 
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |0 0 0 1|     reserved = 0      |          Payload Type         | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  

      Figure 3: PWE3 Payload Type Identifier  

  The meaning of the fields of the PWE3-PTI (Figure 3) are as follows: 

  Payload Type: 
         The PW Type as defined in the IANA PW Type registry 

  Bits 4 to 15 inclusive are reserved for future use and must be zero. 
  Bits 0..3 MUST be 0x01, and hence differ from the first four bits of 
  an IP packet [BCP]. This provides the necessary MPLS payload 
  discrimination.

5.   IANA considerations 

  This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers 
  Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the PW-
  Type, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC 2424]. 

  There is one namespace that requires allocation, the PW-Type value. 

5.1     Definition of Terms 

  The following terms are used here with the meanings defined in BCP 
  26: "name space", "assigned value", "registration". 

  The following policies are used here with the meanings defined in 
  BCP 26: "Private Use", "First Come First Served", "Expert Review", 
  "Specification Required", "IETF Consensus", "Standards Action". 

  NOTE NEED TO UPDATE ABOVE ONCE SECTION IS COMPLETE 

   

5.2     Recommended Registration Policies 

  For registration requests where a Designated Expert should be 
  consulted, an IESG Area Director for the Internet Area should 
  appoint the Designated Expert. 

  For registration requests requiring Expert Review, the PWE3 mailing 
  list should be consulted. 

  PW-Type codes have a range from x to y.  Because a new Packet Type 
  has considerable impact on interoperability, a new PW-Type code 
  requires Standards Action, and should be allocated starting at TBD. 

  PW-Types codes have a range from x to y, and are the scarcest 
  resource in PWE3, thus they must be allocated with care. 

  PW codes k-j may be allocated following Expert Review, with 
  Specification Required. 

  The values v to x are reserved for vendor specific or experimental 
  use. 

6.   Security Considerations 

   No new security issues arise as a result of the work.
