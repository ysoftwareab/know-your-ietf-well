1.  Introduction

   IPv6-IPv4 translators are needed in order to enable communication
   between IPv4 and IPv6 nodes during the IPv4-IPv6 coexistence phase.
   In order to perform the required function, the translator needs to
   represent IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 address space and the IPv6
   addresses in the IPv4 address space.  Now, representing the IPv6
   addresses in the IPv4 address space requires some form of translation
   state that will define the mapping between the original IPv6 address
   and its representation in the IPv4 address space, However, due to the
   abundance of bits in the IPv6 address space, it is possible to
   represent an IPv4 address in the IPv6 Internet by embedding the
   original IPv4 address in the IPv6 address that will serve as its
   representation in the IPv6 address space.

   The IPv6 address representing the IPv4 address will then be formed by
   prepending an IPv6 prefix and optionally appending a suffix.  This
   memo analyzes the different options to form the IPv6 representation
   of an IPv4 address.  This document attempts to describe the
   advantages, shortcomings, required configuration and preferable
   utilization for each option.

2.  Terminology

   o  NAT64: is a translator device that translates communications
      initiated from the IPv6 side towards the IPv4 side.
   o  NAT46: is a translator device that translates communications
      initiated from the IPv4 side towards the IPv6 side.
   o  DNS64: is a DNS-ALG that synthesizes AAAA RRs for IPv6 nodes
      served by a NAT64 box querying for an FQDN that has no AAAA RR but
      does have an A RR associated.

2.1.  PREFIX64

   The IPv6 representation of an IPv4 address will be formed by
   concatenating a prefix, the IPv4 address and optionally a suffix.
   The prefix is called the PREFIX64 and the suffix is called SUFFIX64.
   The resulting IPv6 representation is depicted in the figure below.


      0                                              127
      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
      |  PREFIX64       | IPv4 addr |  SUFFIX64       |
      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   Figure 2.1: IPv6 representation of an IPv4 address

   The NAT64 device will announce a route in the IPv6 network to sink
   packets directed to the IPv4 network.  This route will contain an
   IPv6 prefix that contains part if not all the IPv6 addresses
   representing the IPv4 addresses.  This means that the prefix
   announced can be the PREFIX64 part alone (if the NAT64 is injecting
   an IPv4 default route), or can be the PREFIX64 plus part of the IPv4
   address (if only a part of the IPv4 address space is routed through
   the particular NAT64 box) In addition, the PREFIX64 and the SUFFIX64
   (if used) are used by the DNS64 function to synthesize AAAA RR.  So,
   the PREFIX64 and the SUFFIX64 (if used) are configured for each NAT64
   gateway, and DNS64 function.

3.  Scenarios

   Four transition scenarios have been identified as relevant:
   o  IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network
   o  IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network
   o  An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet
   o  An IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

4.  Types of prefixes considered

   In this section we describe the different prefixes that can be used
   to represent an IPv4 address in the IPv6 address space.  The relevant
   characteristics of the prefix are:
   o  LIR prefix versus Well-Known prefix: In the Well-Known option, the
      most significant bits of the prefix used to represent IPv4
      addresses in the IPv6 address space can come from a special well
      known prefix assigned by IANA for this purpose or they can come
      from the address block that has been assigned to the network that
      is running the translator box.  In the LIR (Local Internet
      Registry) option, each site allocates one prefix of its own IPv6
      address block to represent IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 address
      space.  In the case of a Well-Known prefix, there would be a
      single representation of a public IPv4 address in the IPv6 address
      space, while in the case of the LIR prefix, each network running a
      translator will use a separate representation of the IPv4 address
      space.
   o  Prefix length: The prefix can have different lengths (irrespective
      of whether the prefix is LIR or Well-Known).  One possible choice
      is to have a /96 prefix.  In this case, the IPv6 representation of
      an IPv4 address is simply the prefix concatenated with the IPv4
      address.  Another option is to have a /32 prefix.  In this case,
      the address representing an IPv4 address would be the prefix
      concatenated to the IPv4 address and then a suffix (that can be
      ::).  In this case, all the "relevant" information is located in
      the upper 64 bits, which can be used for routing following the
      IPv6 address architecture guidelines.  Other prefix lengths can be
      also considered, depending on the case.  For instance, using a /40
      prefix would allow to represent an IPv4 /24 as an IPv6 /64.
   o  Other elements being considered include:
      *  IDENT bits: The idea is to stuff a bit pattern in the interface
         identifier part of the IPv6 address that represents an IPv4
         address to mark the address as an IPv6 representation of an
         IPv4 address.  In particular, it is possible to use the IANA
         OUI for IPv4 address representation.
      *  NAT selector bits: The idea here is to include some bits (6-8
         bits) to select the NAT that will be used to route the packets
         towards the IPv4 Internet.  In this way, in the case a site is
         being served by multiple translators, they all can use the same
         prefix while still identifying a given exit route through a
         particular translator.  One way to do this is for those bits to
         be part of the LIR prefix, and give each NAT64 a different LIR
         prefix.  Another way to do this would be to use the Well-Known
         prefix followed by some bit to identify a particular NAT64 box
         (these bits would be managed locally)

      *  Additional information that may be useful to stuff into the
         IPv6 address regarding the IPv4 packet, notably the port
         information, for potential usage with A+P type of proposals.

5.  Analysis

   In this section, we analyze the impact of the prefix type in the
   different scenarios.

5.1.  IPv6 Routing system scalability

   One critical issue to consider when understanding the impact of the
   type of prefix used is related to the scalability of the routing
   system.  Since a goal of the transition is to make IPv4 only-hosts
   reachable by IPv6-only nodes, the IPv6 addresses representing IPv4
   addresses need to be routable in the portion of the IPv6 network
   served by the NAT64 device.  This implies that the PREFIX64 must be
   contained in one of the routes in the IPv6 domain.  One option is to
   use a default route in the IPv6 domain which would obviously cover
   the PREFIX64.  Another option is to inject one or more routes
   covering the PREFIX64.  Thus, depending on the prefix used and the
   scenario considered, the contribution to the IPv6 routing table may
   vary.  In this section we analyze the effect of the different
   possible prefixes in the IPv6 routing system.

   The scenarios described above can be classified in two classes,
   depending on the scope of the routing information injected by the
   translator:
   o  Connecting an IPv4 Network and the IPv6 Internet: In this case,
      the routing information for reaching the IPv6 prefix used to map
      the IPv4 addresses we want to communicate with is injected to the
      whole IPv6 Internet.  There are two of the above scenarios in this
      class, namely:
      *  IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network
      *  An IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet
   o  Connecting an IPv6 network and the IPv4 Internet: In this case,
      the scope of the routing information about the IPv6 prefix that
      represents the IPv4 addresses is limited to the IPv6 network.
      There are two of the above scenarios in this class, namely:
      *  IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network
      *  An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   A scenario falling in the first class (Connecting an IPv4 Network and
   the IPv6 Internet) is depicted in the figure below.  In this case a
   translator box is located in one of the ends of the link between the
   IPv4 site and the IPv6-only ISP.

   Figure: IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network

   Private and overlapped IPv4 addresses

   In the case that the IPv4 site is using private or overlapped IPv4
   addresses (e.g.  [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr]), then the option of
   using a Well-Known prefix for the IPv6 representation is not
   possible, because multiple sites using private addresses would use
   the same IPv6 representation breaking uniqueness of address
   allocation.  In this case, the only option is to use a LIR prefix
   (either allocated to the IPv6 ISP or directly allocated to the end
   site).  It should be noted that in the face of the imminent IPv4
   depletion, this scenario is expected to be fairly common.

   Public addressing

   In the case the IPv4 end site is using public addresses, the usage of
   the Well-Known prefix would not lead into address collision.
   However, it seems that it may have a negative effect on the BGP
   global routing table.  In particular, in the case depicted above, the
   IPv6 ISP would need to inject a route for each non aggregatable IPv4
   address block its customers have (the IPv6 route injected would
   announce the prefix formed by concatenating the Well-Known prefix and
   the IPv4 prefix).  On the other hand, if a LIR prefix is used, the
   ISP would only need to announce its own prefix, which would contain

Internet-Draft             PREFIX64 Comparison                March 2009


   the IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address of its customers.  So,
   again in this case, it seems that the LIR option is preferred.

   For the scenarios in the second class (Connecting an IPv6 network and
   the IPv4 Internet) the routing scalability issue seems much less
   relevant, as the scope of the routing information is limited to the
   IPv6 network.  In this case, it is most likely that a default route
   to the IPv4 Internet is enough and in the case additional routes are
   needed, their scope will be limited to the IPv6 network.  So, in the
   scenarios of this class, other criteria seems to be more relevant
   than this one.

5.2.  Prefix length

   One issue that is worth considering is the one related to IPv6
   address consumption.  In particular, depending on the selected prefix
   length, IPv6 address consumption can become an issue.  If we consider
   the case of the Well-Known prefix, the prefix would be allocated by
   IANA for this particular purpose.  As such, it seems reasonable that
   a short prefix can be obtained for this.  Requesting for a /24 or
   even a few bits shorter seems feasible.  If a prefix shorter than a
   /32 is obtained, the potential benefit is that IPv4 prefixes can be
   represented as IPv6 prefixes that are shorter than 64 bits.  This
   would result in routing based on the upper 64 bits, which is
   compatible with current IPv6 practices.  For instance, if we use a
   /24 for the Well-Known prefix, an IPv4 /24 would result in an IPv6
   /48, which seems somehow equivalent from the routing perspective.

   On the other hand, if we go for the LIR prefix option, then the
   prefix must come out of the IPv6 allocation for the site running the
   translator.  If the site running the translator is an ISP, then
   probably the allocation of the ISP is a /32 or shorter, so, it may be
   possible for the ISP to allocate a somehow short prefix for this,
   maybe a /40.  However, if the translator is run by an end site, which
   normal allocation is a /48, then the LIR prefix for the translator
   should be much longer than that, possibly a /56.  So, in the case the
   site needs to route based on the IPv4 prefix embedded in the IPv6
   address (e.g. in order to access to different parts of the IPv4 space
   through different routes or different NAT64 devices), then it is
   likely that it will need to route on the lower 64 bits of the IPv6
   address.

   According to current specifications, routers must handle routes
   containing prefixes of any valid length, from 0 to 128.  However,
   some users have reported that routers exhibit worse performance when
   routing using long prefixes, in particular when using prefixes longer
   than 80 bits.  This implies that using prefixes shorter than that
   would result in better performance in some cases.

Internet-Draft             PREFIX64 Comparison                March 2009


   Conclusion: a Well-Known prefix seems to allow a site running a NAT64
   to always route in the higher 80 bits, so it seems to provide some
   additional advantage.

5.3.  Referral support

   This section analyzes the impact of the prefix type selected for
   representing the IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 Internet (Pref64::/N) in
   the referral operations.

   A referral operation is when a host A passes the IP address of a Host
   B to a third Host C as application data.  The host Host C will then
   initiate a communication towards the Host B using the IP address
   received.  This is a common operation in some type of applications,
   such as VoIP or peer-to-peer applications.

   In this section, we perform a general analysis of basic referral
   operations.  A more in depth analysis for the case of SIP can be
   found in [I-D.wing-behave-nat64-referrals]

   There are several referral scenarios as described in this table:



             | Host A | Host B | Host C |
   ---------------------------------------
   Scenario 1 |   v6   |   v6   |   v4   |
   ---------------------------------------
   Scenario 2 |   v6   |   v4   |   v6   |
   ---------------------------------------
   Scenario 3 |   v4   |   v6   |   v6   |
   ---------------------------------------
   Scenario 4 |   v6   |   v4   |   v4   |
   ---------------------------------------
   Scenario 5 |   v4   |   v6   |   v4   |
   ---------------------------------------
   Scenario 6 |   v4   |   v4   |   v6   |
   ---------------------------------------

   All the scenarios where Host A and Host C use a different IP version
   require a specific ALG, since the IP address information contained as
   application data must be translated, in order to be meaningful to the
   receiver (these are scenarios 1, 3, 4 and 6).  Scenarios 2 and 5
   could work without ALG.

   In addition, scenarios 1 and 5 where Host C is IPv4 and Host B is
   IPv6 will need some form of static NAT configuration (either the
   stateless translation or manual configuration of bindings) to work



Miyata & Bagnulo       Expires September 10, 2009              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             PREFIX64 Comparison                March 2009


   because they imply an IPv4 node initiating a communication towards an
   IPv6 node.

   Let's consider the scenario 2, which should work in the dynamic
   binding case without ALGs first:

   There are two relevant configurations for scenario 2: when both Host
   A and Host C are using the same NAT64 box to reach Host B and when
   Host A and Host C are using different NAT64 boxes to reach Host C.
   The case where different NAT64 boxes are involved is considered next
   and then we will move to the case where a single NAT64 box is
   involved.

   The case where different NAT64 boxes are involved is depicted next:



                           |
                           |
    Host_A ---(ISP_A)---NAT64--\
                 |         |    >---Host_B (IPB)
    Host_C ---(ISP_B)---NAT64--/
                           |
                           |
        IPv6 Internet      |     IPv4 Internet




   Figure: Referral scenario #2 involving multiple NAT64 boxes

   So, in this case, Host A will be sending Host B's address to Host C
   as application data.  Now, in the eyes of Host A, Host B's address is
   Pref64_1:IPB:suffix (the suffix is optional, depending on whether
   Pref64_1 is 96 bits long or shorter).

   Host C will then receive Pref64_1:IPB:suffix and will try to initiate
   a communication toward host B using that address.

   We now have two options depending on if the prefix Pref64_1 is a
   Well-Known prefix or is a LIR prefix.
   o  LIR prefix: Host C sends a packet towards Pref64_1:IPB:suffix.
      The packet is routed towards Site 1 since Pref64_1 is part of
      site's 1 address block.  Now, Site 1 has 3 options.  Either it
      forwards the packet to the IPv4 internet or drops it (it can drop
      it at the ingress or in the translator box).  This option doesn't
      make economical sense for site 1 to forward the packet towards the
      v4 internet, because if it did so, it would be providing free v6

      to v4 transit.  So, it makes sense for site 1 to drop the packet.
      Now, if Site 1 drops packets addressed to Pref64_1 coming from the
      outside, referrals break.
   o  Well-Known prefix: In this case Pref64_1=Pref64_2=Pref64.  So,
      HostA sends Pref64:IPB_suffix to Host C. Host C now sends a packet
      to Pref64:IPB:suffix.  In this case, the packet will flow through
      whatever route Site2 has to connect to the IPv4 Internet.  In the
      case depicted in the picture, site2 has its own translator, that
      then would announce a route towards Pref64, so the packet will
      flow through the direct route Site2 has to the IPv4 Internet.  So,
      from this analysis, referrals would work if a Well-Known prefix is
      used.

   Figure: Referral scenario #2 involving a single NAT64 box

   This scenario can occur in two different situations.  One situation
   where this can happen is when we are in the IPv6-network-to-IPv4-
   Internet and that both Host A and Host C are in the same site or
   served by the same ISP (which is providing NAT64 services).  The
   other case where this can happen is on the IPv6-Internet-to-An-IPv4-
   network and the IPv4 network is running the NAT64 box.

   In this case, both the Well-Known prefix and the LIR prefix would
   work, cause the is a single IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address
   of Host B involved, cause there is only one NAT64 box involved.

   So, let's consider the scenarios that may require an ALG next.

   Scenarios 1, 3, 4 and 6.

   A general observation about these scenarios is that in the case a
   Well-Known prefix is used, it would be possible for the ALG to
   identify the IPv6 addresses containing an embedded IPv4 address and
   translate it, cause they could identify the Well-Known prefix and



Miyata & Bagnulo       Expires September 10, 2009              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             PREFIX64 Comparison                March 2009


   know that are not general use IPv6 addresses.  If the Pref64 is a LIR
   prefix, it may be possible for the ALG to translate the address in
   the referral, as long as the translator is configured to know that
   this specific prefix is unused to map IPv4 addresses.

   Another possible case is when the application running in Host A and
   Host C supports both IPv6 and IPv4, but that the hosts have only one
   type of connectivity.  In this case, if the application receives an
   IPv6 address, it could extract the IPv4 address and use it if it
   knows there is only IPv4 connectivity available.  Similarly, if the
   application could create an IPv6 address from the IPv4 address and
   use it if it knows there is only IPv6 connectivity available.  So, in
   scenarios 1 and 4, Host A is v6 and Host C is v4.  Let's assume that
   the application performing the referral supports both v4 and v6.  In
   scenarios 1 and 4, Host A would pass an IPv6 address embedding an
   IPv4 address to Host C. Host C has only IPv4 connectivity.  The
   application in Host C could take the IPv6 address and if the well-
   known prefix is used, identify that this is an IPv6 representation of
   an IPv4 address and extract the IPv4 address and use it.  If the LIR
   prefix is used, the application would need to know the LIR prefix to
   be able to do this, which is not true in the general case.  In
   scenarios 3 and 6, Host A is v4, so it will send an IPv4 address.
   Host C is v6 but the application is v4 and v6.  In this case, the
   application can create the IPv6 representation of the received IPv4
   address.  In order to do that, it needs to discover the PREFIX64 used
   for that.  If the well known prefix is used, the prefix can be
   hardcoded in the application.  If the LIR prefix is used, the
   application will need to implement additional tools to discover it.

   So, we can say that a Well Known prefix is more likely to work with
   referral in the case that an ALG is needed than the LIR prefix.  In
   scenarios 1 and 4, referrals are more likely to work with the Well-
   known prefix, even without ALG and in scenarios 3 and 6, referrals
   are likely to require additional tools to discover the LIR prefix if
   this is used.

   Scenario 5

   Host A is v4, host B is v6 and host C is v4

   In this case, we need a representation of Host B in the v4 world.  In
   this case, the Pref64 seems hardly relevant.

   Conclusion: We can say that in some scenarios, the LIR and the Well-
   Known prefix provide a similar support for referrals, while there are
   other scenarios a Well-Known prefix is more likely to work with
   referral that the LIR prefix.

5.4.  Native connectivity preference in communications involving dual
      stack nodes

   When dual stack nodes are involved in the communication, the
   potential issue is that they prefer translated connectivity over the
   native connectivity.  There are multiple ways to try to deal with
   this issue.

   There are two different cases involving dual-stack nodes.
   Communication initiated from a dual stack node towards an IPv4-only
   node and communication initiated from an IPv6-only node towards a
   dual stack node.  We will next consider each one of these cases.

   Communication initiated from an IPv6-only node towards a dual stack
   node

   In this case, the IPv6 only node will query for the FQDN of the dual
   stack node.  The DNS64 function will try first to get the AAAA RR.
   Since there is one available, it will return it and no AAAA RR will
   be synthesized from the A RR of the dual stack node.  However, it
   should be noted that the DNS64 must first try to get the real AAAA RR
   before starting the synthesis, if not, it may result in the
   aforementioned problem.  This case seems orthogonal to the type of
   PREFIX64 used, so it provides no additional criteria on this matter.

   Communication initiated from a dual stack node toward an IPv4 only
   node

   Nodes that have both IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity and are configured
   with an address for a DNS64 as their resolving nameserver may receive
   responses containing synthetic AAAA resource records.  If the node
   prefers IPv6 over IPv4, using the addresses in the synthetic AAAA RRs
   means that the node will attempt to communicate through the NAT64
   mechanism first, and only fall back to native IPv4 connectivity if
   connecting through NAT64 fails (if the application tries the full set
   of destination addresses).  (We are assuming that the IPv4 only node
   has a public IPv4 address, so it can be reached through IPv4 and also
   be reached from the IPv6 Internet using a NAT64.  In the case, the
   IPv4 only host has only a private IPv4 address, then there is no A RR
   so, the only possible connectivity is through the NAT64 and there is
   no issue)

   In order for the node to prefer native connectivity, we can configure
   the PREFIX64 in the RFC3484 policy table.  If a Well-Known prefix is
   used, it can be configured in the default policy table.  If we use a
   LIR prefix, we need a means to properly configure the policy table,
   which is not currently available (only manual configuration is
   currently defined) (see [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-sol] for more on

   this topic).

5.5.  DNSALG configuration

   The DNS64 address rewriting function translates A records to AAAA
   records and needs to know the PREFIX64.  This is straight forward if
   the PREFIX64 is a well-known prefix.

   If the PREFIX64 is the LIR prefix, it needs to be configured into the
   host performing the DNS64 function.  If this is a server, such
   configuration is trivial.  However, an end host would need to learn
   the PREFIX64 automatically (e.g., using DHCP) but DNSSEC would also
   require secure learning of the PREFIX64.  Mechanisms to learn
   PREFIX64 securely, without a pre-shared secret [RFC3118], are still
   being studied.

   The result is that the LIR prefix option requires more tools than the
   Well Known prefix in the IPv6-network-to-IPv4-Internet case.

5.6.  Support for multiple translators

   Consider the following scenario:

   Figure: Multiple translator scenario

   Routing hiccups

   Consider the case host H1 is communicating with host H2 using TCP.
   Suppose that shortest path routing based on hop count is used in the
   IPv6 site.

   If both translators are using the same prefix to represent IPv4
   addresses in the IPv6 Internet, then both NAT64_1 and NAT64_2 would
   announce a route to the prefix in the IGP.  In that case, packets
   from H1 to H2 will flow through NAT64_2.  Suppose now that the
   interface of R3 that is attached to LAN1 goes down.  The result is
   that NAT64_1 is closer from H1 than NAT64_2 in the new topology, so
   packet will flow through NAT64_1.  As a consequence, the established
   TCP connection will break, cause the IPv4 address presented to H2
   will change after packets start flowing through NAT64_1.

   On the other hand, if a different prefix is assigned to each
   translator, then the situation is that each translator will be
   announcing a route to a different prefix so, no matter what changes



Miyata & Bagnulo       Expires September 10, 2009              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft             PREFIX64 Comparison                March 2009


   occur in the intra site routing, the communication will always flow
   through the same NAT64 device as long as there is a path available.

   However, this is not the only scenario to be considered when dealing
   with multiple NAT64 boxes.  Consider next the interaction with the
   DNS64.  In the case there is a single prefix being used by both
   translators, then the task of the DNS64 is simple, it needs to
   synthesize AAAA RR using the prefix.  As long as there is a
   translator working and announcing a route to the prefix, the
   communication will flow.  On the other hand, if there are multiple
   prefixes, then the DNS64 needs to select which prefixes to use when
   synthesizing the AAAA RR.  This may be tricky when one of the
   translators is down.  In that case, using the prefix assigned to that
   translator would prevent the communication.  There are multiple ways
   to deal with this situation.  One option is to allow the DNS64 to
   synthesize multiple AAAA RRs using the different prefixes and
   eventually return them in a round robin order to achieve load
   balancing.  If the translator associated to the first prefix is down,
   then the host would retry with the second address corresponding to
   the alternative translator.  The problem with this approach is that a
   host's different TCP connections would likely go out different
   NAT64s.  And because each NAT64 has a different public IPv4 address,
   the host's different TCP connections now have different IPv4
   addresses -- which most of the IPv4 Internet regards as "different
   identities" (because IPv4 address = identity).  This breaks certain
   applications [e.g., see http://cr.yp.to/ftp/security.html, web
   applications that embed IP addresses in cookies or their
   authorization mechanisms).  Other options would include both
   translators injecting routes to both prefixes, but with different IGP
   weight, or that the DNS64 probes the NAT64 boxes for availability.

   This issue is somehow orthogonal on whether the prefix is Well-Known
   or LIR.  In both cases, it is possible to use a single prefix for
   multiple translators or different prefixes for different translators.
   In any case, this would be achieved by inserting (or not) some subnet
   bits between the prefix and the embedded IPv4 address that would be
   used to identify the translator box.  This issue does have
   implications on some of the different issues considered before.  In
   particular, if a per translator prefix is used, then there is the
   need to configure the prefix in the DNSALG, so the non configuration
   feature of the Well-Known prefix is no longer achieved.

6.  Preliminary conclusion

   Strong conclusion: The LIR prefix seems suitable option for the IPv6-
   Internet-to-an-IPv4-network scenario.

   Weak conclusion: The Well-Known prefix seems to provide some
   advantages over the LIR prefix in the An-IPv6-network-to-IPv4-
   Internet scenario.

7.  Security Considerations

   The PREFIX64 is a critical piece of information when synthesizing
   AAAA RR by the DNS64.  So, the PREFIX64 must be learn in a secure
   fashion by the DNS64.  As we discussed previously, if PREFIX64 is a
   Well-Known prefix it can be hardcoded in the DNS64, but it is a LIR
   prefix, additional means need to be provided to allow DNS64 to learn
   the PREFIX64 to be used in a secure manner.
