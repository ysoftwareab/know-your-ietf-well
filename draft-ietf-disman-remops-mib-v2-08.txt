   Lookup capability is defined in order to enable resolution of either
   an IP address to an DNS name or a DNS name to an IP address at a
   remote host.

   Currently, there are several enterprise-specific MIBs for performing
   remote ping or traceroute operations.  The purpose of this memo is to
   define a standards-based solution to enable interoperability.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines standards-based MIB modules for performing
   specific remote operations.  The remote operations defined by this
   document consist of the ping, traceroute, and lookup functions.

   Ping and traceroute are two very useful functions for managing
   networks.  Ping is typically used to determine if a path exists
   between two hosts, while traceroute shows an actual path.

   Both ping and traceroute yield round-trip times measured in
   milliseconds.  These times can be used as a rough approximation for
   network transit time.

   The lookup functions considered in this document are the equivalents
   of name to address conversion functions such as gethostbyname() /
   gethostbyaddr() and getaddrinfo() / getnameinfo().

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.1.  Ping

   Ping is usually implemented using the Internet Control Message
   Protocol (ICMP) "ECHO" facility.  It is also possible to implement a
   ping capability using alternate methods, some of which are:

   o   Using the UDP echo port (7), if supported.

       This is defined by RFC 862 [RFC862].

   o   Timing an SNMP query.

   o   Timing a TCP connect attempt.

   In general, almost any request/response flow can be used to generate
   a round-trip time.  Often many of the non-ICMP ECHO facility methods
   stand a better chance of yielding a good response (not timing out for
   example) since some routers don't honor Echo Requests (timeout
   situation) or they are handled at lower priority, hence possibly
   giving false indications of round trip times.

   It must be noted that almost any of the various methods used for
   generating a round-trip time can be considered a form of system
   attack when used excessively.  Sending a system requests too often
   can negatively effect its performance.  Attempting to connect to what
   is supposed to be an unused port can be very unpredictable.  There
   are tools that attempt to connect to a range of TCP ports to test
   that any receiving server can handle erroneous connection attempts.

Internet-Draft                 REMOPS MIB                  February 2006


   It also is important to the management application using a remote
   ping capability to know which method is being used.  Different
   methods will yield different response times since the protocol and
   resulting processing will be different.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   ping capability defined within this memo be implemented using the
   ICMP Echo Facility.

1.2.  Traceroute

   Traceroute is usually implemented by transmitting a series of probe
   packets with increasing time-to-live values.  A probe packet is a UDP
   datagram encapsulated into an IP packet.  Each hop in a path to the
   target (destination) host rejects the probe packet (probe's TTL too
   small) until its time-to-live value becomes large enough for the
   probe to be forwarded.  Each hop in a traceroute path returns an ICMP
   message that is used to discover the hop and to calculate a round
   trip time.  Some systems use ICMP probes (ICMP Echo request packets)
   instead of UDP ones to implement traceroute.  In both cases
   traceroute relies on the probes being rejected via an ICMP message to
   discover the hops taken along a path to the final destination.  Both
   probe types, UDP and ICMP, are encapsulated into an IP packet and
   thus have a TTL field that can be used to cause a path rejection.

   Implementations of the remote traceroute capability as defined within
   this memo SHOULD be done using UDP packets to a (hopefully) unused
   port.  ICMP probes (ICMP Echo Request packets) SHOULD NOT be used.
   Many PC implementations of traceroute use the ICMP probe method,
   which they should not, since this implementation method has been
   known to have a high probability of failure.  Intermediate hops
   become invisible when a router either refuses to send an ICMP TTL
   expired message in response to an incoming ICMP packet or simply
   tosses ICMP echo requests altogether.

   The behavior of some routers not to return a TTL expired message in
   response to an ICMP Echo request is due in part to the following text
   extracted from RFC 792 [RFC792]:

   "The ICMP messages typically report errors in the processing of
   datagrams.  To avoid the infinite regress of messages about messages
   etc., no ICMP messages are sent about ICMP messages."

1.3.  Lookup

   The Lookup operation enables remote lookup of addresses for a
   symbolic name as it is, for example, performed by functions
   getnameinfo() or gethostbyaddr() and lookup of symbolic names for a
   addresses as it is, for example, performed by functions getaddrinfo()
   or gethostbyname().  The lookup capability can be used to determine
   the symbolic name of a hop in a traceroute path.

1.4.  Remote Operations

   The MIB modules defined in this document allow a management station
   to initiate ping, traceroute and lookup operations remotely.  The
   basic scenario is illustrated by the following diagram.


             +-------+           +-------+           +-------+
             |       |---------->|       |           |       |
             |       | initiate  |       |---------->|       |
             | Mgmt. | operation |Managed|  perform  |Target |
             |Station| remotely  | Node  | operation | Host  |
             |       |           |       |           |       |
             |       |<----------|       |           |       |
             +-------+  receive  +-------+           +-------+
                       result of
                       operation


   A management station is the local host from which the remote ping,
   traceroute, or Lookup operation is initiated using an SNMP request.
   The Managed Node is a remote host where the MIBs defined by this memo
   are implemented that receives the remote operation via SNMP and
   performs the actual ping, traceroute, or lookup function.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Structure of the MIBs

   This document defines three MIB modules:

   o   DISMAN-PING-MIB

       Defines a ping MIB.



White, Quittek             Expires August 2006                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 REMOPS MIB                  February 2006


   o   DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB

       Defines a traceroute MIB.

   o   DISMAN-NSLOOKUP-MIB

       Provides access to lookup functions for symbolic names and
       addreeses at a remote host, for example provided by functions
       getaddrinfo() / getnameinfo() and gethostbyname() /
       gethostbyaddr().

   The ping and traceroute MIBs are structured to allow creation of ping
   or traceroute tests that can be set up to periodically issue a series
   of operations and generate NOTIFICATIONs to report on test results.
   Many network administrators have in the past written UNIX shell
   scripts or command batch files to operate in fashion similar to the
   functionality provided by the ping and traceroute MIBs defined within
   this memo.  The intent of this document is to acknowledge the
   importance of these functions and to provide a standards-based
   solution.

3.1.  Ping MIB

   The DISMAN-PING-MIB consists of the following components:

   o   pingMaxConcurrentRequests

   o   pingCtlTable

   o   pingResultsTable

   o   pingProbeHistoryTable

3.1.1.  pingMaxConcurrentRequests

   The object pingMaxConcurrentRequests enables control of the maximum
   number of concurrent active requests that an agent implementation
   supports.  It is permissible for an agent either to limit the maximum
   upper range allowed for this object or to implement this object as
   read-only with an implementation limit expressed as its value.

3.1.2.  pingCtlTable

   A remote ping test is started by setting pingCtlAdminStatus to
   enabled(1).  The corresponding pingCtlEntry MUST have been created
   and its pingCtlRowStatus set to active(1) prior to starting the test.
   A single SNMP PDU can be used to create and start a remote ping test.
   Within the PDU, pingCtlTargetAddress should be set to the target
   host's address (pingCtlTargetAddressType will default to ipv4(1)),
   pingCtlAdminStatus to enabled(1), and pingCtlRowStatus to

Internet-Draft                 REMOPS MIB                  February 2006


   createAndGo(4).

   The first index element, pingCtlOwnerIndex, is of type
   SnmpAdminString, a textual convention that allows for use of the
   SNMPv3 View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 3415 [RFC3415], VACM) and
   allows a management application to identify its entries.  The second
   index, pingCtlTestName (also an SnmpAdminString), enables the same
   management application to have multiple requests outstanding.

   Using the maximum value for the parameters defined within a pingEntry
   can result in a single remote ping test taking at most 15 minutes
   (pingCtlTimeOut times pingCtlProbeCount) plus whatever time it takes
   to send the ping request and receive its response over the network
   from the target host.  Use of the defaults for pingCtlTimeOut and
   pingCtlProbeCount yields a maximum of 3 seconds to perform a "normal"
   ping test.

   A management application can delete an active remote ping request by
   setting the corresponding pingCtlRowStatus object to destroy(6).

   The contents of the pingCtlTable is preserved across reIPLs (Initial
   Program Loads) of its agent according the values of each of the
   pingCtlStorageType objects.

3.1.3.  pingResultsTable

   An entry in the pingResultsTable is created for a corresponding
   pingCtlEntry once the test defined by this entry is started.

3.1.4.  pingProbeHistoryTable

   The results of past ping probes can be stored in this table on a per
   pingCtlEntry basis.  This table is initially indexed by
   pingCtlOwnerIndex and pingCtlTestName in order for the results of a
   probe to relate to the pingCtlEntry that caused it.  The maximum
   number of entries stored in this table per pingCtlEntry is determined
   by the value of pingCtlMaxRows.

   An implementation of this MIB will remove the oldest entry in the
   pingProbeHistoryTable of the corresponding entry in the pingCtlTable
   to allow the addition of an new entry once the number of rows in the
   pingProbeHistoryTable reaches the value specified by pingCtlMaxRows
   for the corresponding entry in the pingCtlTable.  An implementation
   MUST start assigning pingProbeHistoryIndex values at 1 and wrap after
   exceeding the maximum possible value as defined by the limit of this
   object ('ffffffff'h).

3.2.  Traceroute MIB

   The DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB consists of the following components:

   o   traceRouteMaxConcurrentRequests

   o   traceRouteCtlTable

   o   traceRouteResultsTable

   o   traceRouteProbeHistoryTable

   o   traceRouteHopsTable

3.2.1.  traceRouteMaxConcurrentRequests

   The object traceRouteMaxConcurrentRequests enables control of the
   maximum number of concurrent active requests that an agent
   implementation supports.  It is permissible for an agent either to
   limit the maximum upper range allowed for this object or to implement
   this object as read-only with an implementation limit expressed as
   its value.

3.2.2.  traceRouteCtlTable

   A remote traceroute test is started by setting
   traceRouteCtlAdminStatus to enabled(1).  The corresponding
   traceRouteCtlEntry MUST have been created and its
   traceRouteCtlRowStatus set to active(1) prior to starting the test.
   A single SNMP PDU can be used to create and start a remote traceroute
   test.  Within the PDU, traceRouteCtlTargetAddress should be set to
   the target host's address (traceRouteCtlTargetAddressType will
   default to ipv4(1)), traceRouteCtlAdminStatus to enabled(1), and
   traceRouteCtlRowStatus to createAndGo(4).

   The first index element, traceRouteCtlOwnerIndex, is of type
   SnmpAdminString, a textual convention that allows for use of the
   SNMPv3 View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 3415 [RFC3415], VACM) and
   allows a management application to identify its entries.  The second
   index, traceRouteCtlTestName (also an SnmpAdminString), enables the
   same management application to have multiple requests outstanding.

   Traceroute has a much longer theoretical maximum time for completion
   than ping. Basically 42 hours and 30 minutes (the product of
   traceRouteCtlTimeOut, traceRouteCtlProbesPerHop, and
   traceRouteCtlMaxTtl) plus some network transit time!  Use of the
   defaults defined within an traceRouteCtlEntry yields a maximum of 4
   minutes and 30 seconds for a default traceroute operation.  Clearly
   42 plus hours is too long to wait for a traceroute operation to
   complete.

Internet-Draft                 REMOPS MIB                  February 2006


   The maximum TTL value in effect for traceroute determines how long
   the traceroute function will keep increasing the TTL value in the
   probe it transmits hoping to reach the target host.  The function
   ends whenever the maximum TTL is exceeded or the target host is
   reached.  The object traceRouteCtlMaxFailures was created in order to
   impose a throttle for how long traceroute continues to increase the
   TTL field in a probe without receiving any kind of response
   (timeouts).  It is RECOMMENDED that agent implementations impose a
   time limit for how long it allows a traceroute operation to take
   relative to how the function is implemented.  For example, an
   implementation that can't process multiple traceroute operations at
   the same time SHOULD impose a shorter maximum allowed time period.

   A management application can delete an active remote traceroute
   request by setting the corresponding traceRouteCtlRowStatus object to
   destroy(6).

   The contents of the traceRouteCtlTable is preserved across reIPLs
   (Initial Program Loads) of its agent according to the values of each
   of the traceRouteCtlStorageType objects.

3.2.3.  traceRouteResultsTable

   An entry in the traceRouteResultsTable is created upon determining
   the results of a specific traceroute operation.  Entries in this
   table relate back to the traceRouteCtlEntry that caused the
   corresponding traceroute operation to occur.  The objects
   traceRouteResultsCurHopCount and traceRouteResultsCurProbeCount can
   be examined to determine how far the current remote traceroute
   operation has reached.

3.2.4.  traceRouteProbeHistoryTable

   The results of past traceroute probes can be stored in this table on
   a per traceRouteCtlEntry basis.  This table is initially indexed by
   traceRouteCtlOwnerIndex and traceRouteCtlTestName in order for the
   results of a probe to relate to the traceRouteCtlEntry that caused
   it.  The number of entries stored in this table per
   traceRouteCtlEntry is determined by the value of
   traceRouteCtlMaxRows.

   An implementation of this MIB will remove the oldest entry in the
   traceRouteProbeHistoryTable of the corresponding entry in the
   traceRouteCtlTable to allow the addition of an new entry once the
   number of rows in the traceRouteProbeHistoryTable reaches the value
   of traceRouteCtlMaxRows for the corresponding entry in the
   traceRouteCtlTable.  An implementation MUST start assigning
   traceRouteProbeHistoryIndex values at 1 and wrap after exceeding the
   maximum possible value as defined by the limit of this object
   ('ffffffff'h).

Internet-Draft                 REMOPS MIB                  February 2006


3.2.5.  traceRouteHopsTable

   The current traceroute path can be stored in this table on a per
   traceRouteCtlEntry basis.  This table is initially indexed by
   traceRouteCtlOwnerIndex and traceRouteCtlTestName in order for a
   traceroute path to relate to the traceRouteCtlEntry that caused it.
   A third index, traceRouteHopsHopIndex, enables keeping one
   traceRouteHopsEntry per traceroute hop.  Creation of
   traceRouteHopsTable entries is enabled by setting the corresponding
   traceRouteCtlCreateHopsEntries object to true(1).

3.3.  Lookup MIB

   The DISMAN-NSLOOKUP-MIB consists of the following components:

   o   lookupMaxConcurrentRequests, and lookupPurgeTime

   o   lookupCtlTable

   o   lookupResultsTable

3.3.1.  lookupMaxConcurrentRequests and lookupPurgeTime

   The object lookupMaxConcurrentRequests enables control of the maximum
   number of concurrent active requests that an agent implementation is
   structured to support.  It is permissible for an agent either to
   limit the maximum upper range allowed for this object or to implement
   this object as read-only with an implementation limit expressed as
   its value.

   The object lookupPurgeTime provides a method for entries in the
   lookupCtlTable and lookupResultsTable to be automatically deleted
   after the corresponding operation completes.

3.3.2.  lookupCtlTable

   A remote lookup operation is initiated by performing an SNMP SET
   request on lookupCtlRowStatus.  A single SNMP PDU can be used to
   create and start a remote lookup operation.  Within the PDU,
   lookupCtlTargetAddress should be set to the entity to be resolved
   (lookupCtlTargetAddressType will default to ipv4(1)) and
   lookupCtlRowStatus to createAndGo(4).  The object lookupCtlOperStatus

   can be examined to determine the state of an lookup operation.  A
   management application can delete an active remote lookup request by
   setting the corresponding lookupCtlRowStatus object to destroy(6).

   An lookupCtlEntry is initially indexed by lookupCtlOwnerIndex, which
   is of type SnmpAdminString, a textual convention that allows for use
   of the SNMPv3 View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 3415 [RFC3415],


White, Quittek             Expires August 2006                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                 REMOPS MIB                  February 2006


   VACM) and also allows for a management application to identify its
   entries.  The lookupCtlOwnerIndex portion of the index is then
   followed by lookupCtlOperationName.  The lookupCtlOperationName index
   enables the same lookupCtlOwnerIndex entity to have multiple
   outstanding requests.

   The value of lookupCtlTargetAddressType determines which lookup
   function to perform.  Specification of dns(16) as the value of this
   index implies that a functions such as getaddrinfo() or
   gethostbyname() should be performed to determine the numeric
   addresses associated with a symbolic name via lookupResultsTable
   entries.  Use of a value of either ipv4(1) or ipv6(2) implies that a
   function such as getnameinfo() or gethostbyaddr() should be performed
   to determine the symbolic name(s) associated with a numeric address
   at a remote host.

3.3.3.  lookupResultsTable

   The lookupResultsTable is used to store the results of lookup
   operations.  The lookupResultsTable is initially indexed by the same
   index elements that the lookupCtlTable contains (lookupCtlOwnerIndex
   and lookupCtlOperationName) but has a third index element,
   lookupResultsIndex (Unsigned32 textual convention), in order to
   associate multiple results with the same lookupCtlEntry.

   A remote host can be multi-homed and can have multiple symbolic (DNS)
   names.  Therefore, a lookup operation can return multiple IP
   addresses and multiple symbolic names.

   If the lookup operation was performed for a certain address, for
   example, by using getnameinfo() or gethostbyaddr(), then entries in
   the lookupResultsTable MUST be made for each host name returned.  If
   the lookup operation identifies one hostname as the host's 'official
   host name', then this name MUST be assigned a lookupResultsIndex of
   1.

   If a lookup operation was performed for a certain symbolic name, for
   example, by using getaddrinfo() or gethostbyname(), then entries in
   the lookupResultsTable MUST be made for each address returned.  The
   entries MUST be stored in the order that they are retrieved.  Values
   assigned to lookupResultsIndex MUST start at 1 and increase in order.

   An implementation SHOULD NOT retain SNMP-created entries in the
   lookupResultsTable across reIPLs (Initial Program Loads) of its
   agent, since management applications need to see consistent behavior
   with respect to the persistence of the table entries that they
   create.

3.4.  Conformance

   Each of the three MIB modules defined in this document has two
   current compliance statements, one for full compliance and one for
   minimum compliance.  The minimum compliance statements are intended
   to be applied to implementation for devices with very limited
   resources.  The main difference between full and minimum compliance
   is that for minimum compliance dynamic creation and deletion of table
   entries is not required while it is required for full compliance.

   In addition, the DISMAN-PING-MIB module and the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB
   modules each have a deprecated compliance statement that was current
   in RFC 2925.  Semantically, the new full compliance statements are
   identical to the deprecated ones.  But some of the object groups used
   in the old compliance statements needed to be split in order to
   support the new minimal compliance statements.

          Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which
          multiple users may need to independently create or
          modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner
          index'.  Such an initial index has a syntax of
          SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a
          securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in
          accordance with a security policy.

          When used in conjunction with such a security policy all
          entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or

          will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column'
          subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index.
          To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the
          table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries
          with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including
          the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask

          modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner

          these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except
          for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the

           A remote lookup operation starts when its entry
           first becomes active(1).  Transitions in and
           out of active(1) state have no effect on the
           operational behavior of a remote lookup
           operation, with the exception that deletion of
           an entry in this table by setting its RowStatus
           object to destroy(6) will stop an active
           remote lookup operation.

           The operational state of a remote lookup operation
           can be determined by examination of its
           lookupCtlOperStatus object."

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in the three MIB
   modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  pingMaxConcurrentRequests
   o  traceRouteMaxConcurrentRequests
   o  lookupMaxConcurrentRequests
      The MIB modules limit their maximum numbers of concurrent requests
      by the values of these objects.  Unauthorized access to them may
      lead to an overload of the managed node and to a disruption of
      other functions of the managed node.

   o  pingCtlTable
   o  traceRouteCtlTable
   o  lookupCtlTable
      All objects in entries of these tables (except index objects) have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create.  Unauthorized access to these
      objects can disturb the measurements controlled by the tables.
      Also, the functions offered by the MIB modules can be misused for
      illegal data retrieval and for attacking other systems by floods
      of ping probes, traceorute probes or lookup requests,
      respectively.

   In general, all three, the ping, traceroute and lookup functions,
   when used excessively are considered a form of system attack.  In the
   case of ping sending a system requests too often can negatively
   effect its performance or attempting to connect to what is supposed
   to be an unused port can be very unpredictable.  Excessive use of the
   traceroute capability can like ping negatively affect system
   performance.  The same applies to excessive use of the lookup
   service, particularly, if the lookup cannot be resolved locally.  In
   insecure environments it is RECOMMENDED that the MIBs defined within
   this memo not be supported.

   o  lookupPurgeTime
      Unauthorized access to this object can lead to results of lookup
      operations being deleted before they are read by a management
      system, if the object is set to 0 or small values close to 0.  If
      otherwise, the object is set to very high values, unauthorized
      access can lead to a high consumption of resources for storing
      lookup results.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or


White, Quittek             Expires August 2006                 [Page 93]

Internet-Draft                 REMOPS MIB                  February 2006


   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  However, the only information that can be
   disclosed without encryption is the configuration and results of
   measurements that are performed by implementations of the MIB
   modules.

   To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security
   administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)
   defined in RFC 3415 [RFC3415] for tables in which multiple users may
   need to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is
   used as an "owner index".  Such an initial index has a syntax of
   SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName
   or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security
   policy.

   All entries in related tables belonging to a particular user will
   have the same value for this initial index.  For a given user's
   entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the
   information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers
   (except for the "column" subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded
   owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of
   the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the
   value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion,
   and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask "wildcarding" the column subidentifier.
   More elaborate configurations are possible.  The VACM access control
   mechanism described above provides control.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
