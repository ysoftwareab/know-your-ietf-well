           Use cases for Remote Attestation common encodings
                   draft-richardson-rats-usecases-03

Abstract

   This document details mechanisms created for performing Remote
   Attestation that have been used in a number of industries.  The
   document intially focuses on existing industry verticals, mapping
   terminology used in those specifications to the more abstract
   terminology used by RATS.

   The document aspires to describe possible future use cases that would
   be enabled by common formats.

1.  Introduction

   The recently chartered IETF RATS WG intends to create a system of
   attestations that can be shared across a multitude of different
   users.

   This document exists as place to collect use cases for the common
   RATS technologies in support of the IETF RATS charter point 1.  This
   document is not expected to be published as an RFC, but remain open
   as a working document.  It could become an appendix to provide
   motivation for a protocol standards document.

   This document will probably not deal with use cases from an end-user
   point of view, but rather on the technology verticals that wish to
   use RATS concepts (such as EAT) in their deployments.  However, the
   end-user use cases for these verticales will be explained.

   End-user use cases that would either directly leverage RATS
   technology, or would serve to inform technology choices are welcome,
   however.

2.  Terminology

   Critical to dealing with and constrasting different technologies is
   to collect terms with are compatible, to distinguish those terms
   which are similar but used in different ways.

   This section will grow to include forward and external references to
   terms which have been seen.  When terms need to be disambiguated they
   will be prefixed with their source, such as "TCG(claim)" or
   "FIDO(relying party)"

   Platform attestations generally come in two categories.  This
   document will attempt to indicate for a particular attestation
   technology falls into this.

2.1.  Static attestations

   A static attestation says something about the platform on which the
   code is running.

2.2.  Session attestations

   A session attestation says something about how the shared session key
   was created.

2.3.  Statements

   The term "statement" is used as the generic term for the semantic
   content which is being attested to.

3.  Requirements Language

   This document is not a standards track document and does not make any
   normative protocol requirements using terminology described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview of Sources of Use Cases

   The following specifications have been convered in this document:

   o  The Trusted Computing Group "Network Attestation System" (private
      document)

   o  Android Keystore

   o  Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance attestation,

   This document will be expanded to include summaries from:

   o  Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module
      (TPM)/Trusted Software Stack (TSS)

   o  ARM "Platform Security Architecture"
      [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token]

   And any additional sources suggested.

5.  Use case summaries

   This section lists a series of cases where an attestation is done.

5.1.  Device Capabilities/Firmware Attestation

   A network operator wants to know the qualities of the hardware and
   software on the machines attached to their network.  The process
   starts with some kind of Root of Trust, performs a series of
   measurements, and expresses this with an attestation as to the
   hardware and firmware/software which is running.  This is a general
   description for which there are many specific use cases.

5.1.1.  Relying on an Attestation Server

   The measurements from a heterogenous network of devices are provided
   to device-specific attestation servers.  The attestation servers know
   what the "golden" measurements are, and perform the appropriate
   evaluations, resulting in attestations that the relying parties can
   depend upon.

5.1.2.  Autonomous Relying Party

   The signed measurements are sent to a relying party which must
   validate them directly.  (It may do so with the help of of a signed
   list of golden values, or some other process).  The relying party
   needs to validate the signed statements directly.

   This may occur because the network is not connected, or even because
   it can not be connected until the equipment is validated.

5.1.3.  Proxy Root of Trust

   A variety of devices provide measurements via their Root of Trust.  A
   server collects these measurements, and (having applied a local
   policy) then creates a device agnostic attestation.  The relying
   party can validate the claims in a standard format.

5.1.4.  network scaling - small

   An entire network of systems needs to be validated (such as all the
   desktops in an enterprise's building).  The infrastructure is in
   control of a single operator and is already trusted.  The network can
   be partitioned so that machines that do not pass attestation can be
   quarantined.  A 1:1 relationship between the device and the relying
   party can be used to maintain freshness of the attestation.

5.1.5.  network scaling - medium

   An entire network of systems needs to be validated: such as all the
   desktops in an enterprise's building, or all the routers at an ISP.
   The infrastructure is not necessarily trusted: it could be subverted,



Richardson, et al.       Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 useful RATS                     July 2019


   and it must also attest.  The devices may be under a variety of
   operators, and may be mutually suspicious: each device may therefore
   need to process attestations from every other device.  An NxM mesh of
   attestations may be untenable, but a system of N:1:M relationships
   can be setup via proxy attestations.

5.1.6.  network scaling - large

   An entire network of systems need to be continuously attested.  This
   could be all of the smartphones on an LTE network, or every desktop
   system in a worldwide enterprise.  The network operator wishes to do
   this in order maintain identities of connected devices more than to
   validate correct firmware, but both situations are reasonable.

5.1.7.  Computation characteristics

   A group of enterprises organized as a consortium seeks to deploy
   computing node s as the basis of their shared blockchain system.
   Each member of the consortium must forward an equal number of
   computing nodes to participate in the P2P network of nodes that form
   the basis of the blockchain system.  In order to prevent the various
   issues (e.g. concentration of hash power, anonymous mining nodes)
   found in other blockchain systems, each computing node must comply to
   a predefined allowable manifest of system hardware, software and
   firmware, as agreed to by the membership of the consortium.  Thus, a
   given computing node must be able to report the (pre-boot)
   configuration of its system and be able to report at an y time the
   operational status of the various components that make-up its system.

   The consortium seeks to have the following things attested: system
   configuration, group membership, and virtualization status.

   This is a peer-to-peer protocol so each device in the consortium is a
   relying party.  The attestation may be requested online by another
   entity within the consortium, but not by other parties.  The
   attestation needs to be compact and interoperable and may be included
   in the blockchain itself at the completion of the consensus
   algorithm.

   The attestation will need to start in a hardware RoT in order to
   validate if the system is running real hardware rather than running a
   virtual machine.

5.2.  Cryptographic Key Attestation

   The relying party wants to know how secure a private key that
   identifies an entity is.  Unlike the network attestation, the relying
   party is not part of the network infrastructure, nor do they

Internet-Draft                 useful RATS                     July 2019


   necessarily have a business relationship (such as ownership) over the
   end device.

5.2.1.  Device Type Attestation

   This use case convinces the relying party of the characteristics of a
   device.  For privacy reasons, it might not identify the actual device
   itself, but rather the class of device.  The relying party can
   understand from either in-band (claims) or out-of-band (model
   numbers, which may be expressed as a claim) whether the device has
   features such as a hardware TPM, software TPM via TEE, or software
   TPM without TEE.  Other details such as the availability of finger-
   print readers or HDMI outputs may also be inferred.

5.2.2.  Key storage attestation

   This use case convinces the relying party only about the provenance
   of a private key by providing claims of the storage security of the
   private key.  This can be conceived as a subset of the previous case,
   but may be apply very specifically to just a keystore.  Additional
   details associated with the private key may be provided as well,
   including limitations on usage of the key.

   Key storage attestations may be consumed by systems provisioning
   public key certificates for devices or human users.  In these cases,
   attestations may be incorporated into certificate request protocols
   (e.g., EST {#rfc7030}, CMP {#rfc4210}, ACME {#rfc8555}, SCEP
   [I-D.gutmann-scep], etc.) and processed by registration authorities
   or certification authorities prior to determining contents for any
   issued certificate.

5.2.3.  End user authorization

   This use case convinces the relying party that the digital signatures
   made by the indicated key pair were done with the approval of the
   end-user operator.  This may also be considered possible subset of
   the device attestation above, but the attestation may be on a case-
   by-case basis.  The nature of the approval by the end-user would be
   indicated.  Examples include: the user unlocked the device, the user
   viewed some message and acknowledge it inside an app, the message was
   displayed to the user via out-of-app control mechanism.  The
   acknowledgements could include selecting options on the screen,
   pushing physical buttons, scanning fingerprints, proximity to other
   devices (via bluetooth beacons, chargers, etc)

Internet-Draft                 useful RATS                     July 2019


5.3.  Geographic attestation

   The relying party wants to know the physical location (on the planet
   earth) of the device.  This may be provided directly by a
   GPS/GLONASS/Galileo module that is incorporated into a TPM.  This may
   also be provided by collecting other proximity messages from other
   device that the relying party can form a trust relationship with.

5.3.1.  I am here

   The simplest use case is the claim of some specific coordinates.

5.3.2.  I am near

   The second use case is the claim that some other devices are nearby.
   This may be absolute ("I am near device X, which claims to be at
   location A"), or just relative, ("I am near device X").  This use
   could use "I am here" or "I am near" claims from a 1:1 basis with
   device X, or use some other protocol.  The nature of how the
   proximity was established would be part of this claim.  In order to
   defeat a variety of mechanisms that might attempt to proxy
   ("wormhole") radio communications, highly precise clocks may be
   required, and there may also have to be attestations as to the
   precision of those clocks.

   An additional example of being near would be for the case where two
   smartphones can establish that they are together by recording a
   common random movement, such as both devices being shaken together.
   Each device may validate the claim from the other (in a disconnected
   fashion), or a third party may validate the claim as the relying
   party.

   This could be used to establish that a medical professional was in
   proximity of a patient with implanted devices who needs help.

5.3.3.  You are here

   A third way to establish location is for a third party to communicate
   directly with the relying party.  The nature of how this trust is
   established (and whether it is done recursively) is outside of the
   scope here.  What is critical is that the identity of "You" can be
   communicated through the third party in a way that the relying party
   can use, but other intermediaries can not view.

5.4.  Connectivity attestation

   The relying party wants to know what devices are connected.  A
   typical situation would be a media owner needing to know what TV
   device is connected via HDMI and if High-bandwidth Digital Content
   Protection (HDCP) is intact.

6.  Technology users for RATS

6.1.  Trusted Computing Group (TCG)

   The TCG is trying to solve the problem of knowing if a networking
   device should be part of a network, if it belongs to the operator,
   and if it is running approriate software.  The work covers most of
   the use cases in Section 5.1.

   This proposal is a work-in-progress, and is available to TCG members
   only.  The goal is to be multi-vendor, scalable and extensible.  The
   proposal intentionally limits itself to:

   o  "non-privacy-preserving applications (i.e., networking, Industrial
      IoT )",

   o  that the firmware is provided by the device manufacturer

   o  that there is a manufacturer installed hardware root of trust
      (such as a TPM and boot room)

   Service providers and enterprises deploy hundreds of routers, many of
   them in remote locations where they're difficult to access or secure.
   The point of remote attestation is to:

   o  identify a remote box in a way that's hard to spoof

   o  report the inventory of software was launched on the box in a way
      that can not be spoofed

   The use case described is to be able to monitor the authenticity of
   software versions and configurations running on each device.  This
   allows owners and auditors to detect deviation from approved software
   and firmware versions and configurations, potentially identifying
   infected devices.

   Attestation may be performed by network management systems.
   Networking Equipment is often highly interconnected, so it's also
   possible that attestation could be performed by neighboring devices.

   Specifically listed to be out of scope for the first generation
   includes: Linux processes, assemblies of hardware/software created by
   end-customers, and equipment that is sleepy.  There is an intention
   to cover some of these are topics in future versions of the
   documents.

   The TCG Attestation leverages the TPM to make a series of
   measurements during the boot process, and to have the TPM sign those
   measurements.  The resulting "PCG" hashes are then available to an
   external verifier.

   The TCG uses the following terminology:

   o  Device Manufacuter

   o  Attester ("device under attestation")

   o  Verifier (Network Management Station)

   o  "Explicit Attestation" is the TCG term for a static (platform)
      statement.

   o  "Implicit Attestation" is the TCG term for a session statement.

   o  Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM), which are signed my device
      manufacturer and integrated into firmware.

   o  Quotes: measured values (having been signed), and RIMs

   o  Reference Integrity Values (RIV)

   o  devices have a Initial Attestation Key (IAK), which is provisioned
      at the same time as the IDevID.

   o  PCR - Platform Configuration Registry (deals with hash chains)

   The TCG document builds upon a number of IETF technologies: SNMP
   (Attestation MIB), YANG, XML, JSON, CBOR, NETCONF, RESTCONF, CoAP,
   TLS and SSH.  The TCG document leverages the 802.1AR IDevID and
   LDevID processes.

6.2.  Android Keystore system

   [keystore] describes a system used in smart phones that run the
   Android operation system.  The system is primarily a software
   container to contain and control access to cryptographic keys, and
   therefore provides many of the same functions that a hardware Trusted
   Platform Module might provide.



Richardson, et al.       Expires January 9, 2020               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                 useful RATS                     July 2019


   The uses described in section Section 5.2 are the primary focus.

   On hardware which is supported, the Android Keystore will make use of
   whatever trusted hardware is available, including use of Trusted
   Execution Environment (TEE) or Secure Element (SE).  The Keystore
   therefore abstracts the hardware, and guarantees to applications that
   the same APIs can be used on both more and less capable devices.

   A great deal of focus from the Android Keystore seems to be on
   providing fine-grained authorization of what keys can be used by
   which applications.

   XXX - clearly there must be additional (intended?) use cases that
   provide some kind of attestation.

   Android 9 on Pixel 2 and 3 can provided protected confirmation
   messages.  This uses hardware access from the TPM/TEE to display a
   message directly to the user, and receives confirmation directly from
   the user.  A hash of the contents of the message can provided in an
   attestation that the device provides.

   In addition, the Android Keystore provides attestation information
   about itself for use by FIDO.

   QUOTE: Finally, the Verified Boot state is included in key
   attestation certificates (provided by Keymaster/Strongbox) in the
   deviceLocked and verifiedBootState fields, which can be verified by
   apps as well as passed onto backend services to remotely verify boot
   integrity

6.3.  Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance

   The FIDO Alliance [fido] has a number of specifications aimed
   primarily at eliminating the need for passwords for authentication to
   online services.  The goal is to leverage asymmetric cryptographic
   operations in common browser and smart-phone platforms so that users
   can easily authentication.

   The use cases of Section 5.2 are primary.

   FIDO specifications extend to various hardware second factor
   authentication devices.

   Terminology includes:

   o  "relying party" validates a claim

   o  "relying party application" makes FIDO Authn calls

   o  "browser" provides Web Authentication JS API

   o  "platform" is the base system

   o  "internal authenticator" is some credential built-in to the device

   o  "external authenticator" may be connected by USB, bluetooth, wifi,
      and may be an stand-alone device, USB connected key, phone or
      watch.

   FIDO2 had a Key Attestation Format [fidoattestation], and a Signature
   Format [fidosignature], but these have been combined into the W3C
   document [fido_w3c] specification.

   A FIDO use case involves a relying party having an attestation on the
   biometric system that identifies a human.  It is the state of the
   biometric system that is being attested to, not the identity of the
   human!

   FIDO does provides a transport in the form of the WebAuthn and FIDO
   CTAP protocols.

   According to [fidotechnote] FIDO uses attestation to make claims
   about the kind of device which is be used to enroll.  Keypairs are
   generated on a per-device _model_ basis, with a certificate having a
   trust chain that leads back to a well-known root certificate.  It is
   expected that as many as 100,000 devices in a production run would
   have the same public and private key pair.  One assumes that this is
   stored in a tamper-proof TPM so it is relatively difficult to get
   this key out.  The use of this key attests to the the device type,
   and the kind of protections for keys that the relying party may
   assume, not to the identity of the end user.

7.  Examples of Existing Attestation Formats.

   This section provides examples of some existing attestation formats.

7.1.  Android Keystore

   Android Keystore attestations take the form of X.509 certificates.
   The examples below package the attestation certificate along with
   intermediate CA certificates required to validate the attestation as
   a certificates-only SignedData message [RFC5652].  The trust anchor
   is available here: [keystore_attestation].

   The attestations below were generated using the generateKeyPair
   method from the DevicePolicyManager class using code similar to the
   following.

7.3.  Yubikey

   As with the Android Keystore attestations, Yubikey attestations take
   the form of an X.509 certificate.  As above, the certificate is
   presented here packaged along with an intermediate CA certificate as
   a certificates-only SignedData message.

   The attestations below were generated using code similar to that
   found in the yubico-piv-tool (https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-piv-
   tool).  Details regarding attestations are here:
   https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/PIV_attestation.html
