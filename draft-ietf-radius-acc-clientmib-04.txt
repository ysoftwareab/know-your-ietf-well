3.  Abstract

This memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS accounting
client functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Management
Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
Internet community.  Using these extensions IP-based management stations
can manage RADIUS accounting clients.

4.  Introduction

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
accounting clients.

Today a wide range of network devices, including routers and NASes, act
as RADIUS accounting clients in order to provide accounting services.
As a result, the effective management of RADIUS accounting clients is of
considerable importance.


5.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

INTERNET-DRAFT        RADIUS Accounting Client MIB      10 February 1999


This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be poduced through the appropriate
translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


6.  Overview

The RADIUS accounting protocol, described in [16], distinguishes between
the client function and the server function. In RADIUS accounting,
clients send Accounting-Requests, and servers reply with Accounting-
Responses. Typically NAS devices implement the client function, and thus
would be expected to implement the RADIUS accounting client MIB, while
RADIUS accounting servers implement the server function, and thus would
be expected to implement the RADIUS accounting server MIB.

However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to perform both
client and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as a
server to one or more RADIUS accounting clients, while simultaneously
acting as an accounting client to one or more accounting servers.  In
such situations, it is expected that RADIUS entities combining client
and server functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.


6.1.  Selected objects
This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table:

(1)  the RADIUS Accounting Server Table contains one row for each
     RADIUS server that the client shares a secret with.

Each entry in the RADIUS Accounting Server Table includes thirteen
columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS client.

9.  Security considerations

There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter
or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP SET
opertions.

There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
sensitive information. These are:

radiusAccServerAddress
          This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS
          accounting server with which the client is communicating. This
          information could be useful in mounting an attack on the
          acounting server, which may contain sensitive financial data.

          This can be used to determine the port number on which the
          RADIUS accounting client is sending. This information could be
          useful in impersonating the client in order to send fraudulent
          data to the accounting server.

It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features

for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network itself
is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as to who on
the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access Control
Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.  Using these security features,
customer/users can give access to the objects only to those principals
(users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete)
them.
