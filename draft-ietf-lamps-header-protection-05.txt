                      Header Protection for S/MIME
                 draft-ietf-lamps-header-protection-05

Abstract

   S/MIME version 3.1 has introduced a feasible standardized option to
   accomplish Header Protection.  However, few implementations generate
   messages using this structure, and several legacy and non-legacy
   implementations have revealed rendering issues at the receiving side.
   Clearer specifications regarding message processing, particularly
   with respect to header sections, are needed in order to resolve these
   rendering issues.  Some mail user agents are also sending and
   receiving cryptographically-protected message headers using a
   different structure.

   In order to help implementers to correctly compose and render email
   messages with Header Protection, this document updates S/MIME Header
   Protection specifications with additional guidance on MIME format,
   sender and receiver processing.

1.  Introduction

   Privacy and security issues regarding email Header Protection in S/
   MIME have been identified for some time.  Most current
   implementations of cryptographically-protected electronic mail
   protect only the body of the message, which leaves significant room
   for attacks against otherwise-protected messages.  For example, lack
   of header protection allows an attacker to substitute the message
   subject and/or author.

   This document describes two different structures for how message
   headers can be cryptographically protected, and provides guidance for
   implementers of MUAs that generate and interpret such messages.  It
   takes particular care to ensure that messages interact reasonably
   well with legacy MUAs.

1.1.  Two Schemes of Protected Headers

   Unfortunately, there are two different schemes for cryptographically-
   protected email headers that may be in use on the Internet today.
   This document addresses them both and provides guidance to
   implementers.

   One scheme is the form specified in S/MIME 3.1 and later, which
   involves wrapping a "message/rfc822" MIME object with a Cryptographic
   Envelope.  This document calls this scheme "Wrapped Message", and it
   is documented in more detail in [RFC8551].  Experience has shown that
   this form does not interact well with some legacy MUAs (see
   Section 1.2).

   Consequently, another form of header protection is produced and
   consumed by some MUAs, where the protected headers are placed
   directly on the Cryptographic Payload, without using an intervening
   "message/*" MIME object.  This document calls this scheme "Injected
   Headers", and it is documented in more detail in
   [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers].

1.2.  Problems with Wrapped Messages

   Several legacy MUAs have revealed rendering issues when dealing with
   a message with headers protected by the Wrapped Message scheme.  In
   some cases the user sees an attachment suggesting a forwarded email
   message, which -- in fact -- contains the protected email message
   that should be rendered directly.  For these cases, the user can
   click on the attachment to view the protected message.  However,
   there have also been reports of email clients displaying garbled
   text, or sometimes nothing at all.  In those cases the email clients
   on the receiving side are (most likely) not fully MIME-capable.

   The following shortcomings have been identified to cause these
   issues:

   *  Broken or incomplete implementations

   *  Lack of a simple means to distinguish "forwarded message" and
      "wrapped message" (for the sake of Header Protection)

   *  Not enough guidance with respect to handling of Header Fields on
      both the sending and the receiving side

1.3.  Problems with Injected Headers

   A legacy MUA dealing with an encrypted message that has some header
   fields obscured using the Injected Headers scheme will not render the
   obscured header fields to the user at all.  A workaround "legacy
   display" mechanism is provided in this document, which some legacy
   MUAs will render to the user, albeit not in the same location that
   the header fields would normally be rendered.  However, some legacy
   MUAs also fail to render the "legacy display" part, leaving the
   obscured header fields hidden from users of those MUAs.

1.4.  Motivation

   Furthermore, the need (technical) Data Minimization, which includes
   data sparseness and hiding all technically concealable information,
   has grown in importance over the past several years.  In addition,
   backwards compatibility must be considered when it is possible to do
   so without compromising privacy and security.

   No mechanism for Header Protection has been standardized for PGP/MIME
   (Pretty Good Privacy) [RFC3156] yet.  PGP/MIME developers have
   implemented ad-hoc header-protection, and would like to see a
   specification that is applicable to both S/MIME and PGP/MIME.

   This document describes the problem statement (Section 2), generic
   use cases (Section 3) and the specification for Header Protection
   (Section 4) with guidance on MIME format, sender and receiver
   processing .

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-header-protection-requirements] defines the
   requirements that this specification is based on.

   This document is in an early draft state and contains a proposal on
   which to base future discussions of this topic.  In any case, the
   final mechanism is to be determined by the IETF LAMPS WG.

1.5.  Other Protocols to Protect Email Headers

   A range of protocols for the protection of electronic mail (email)
   exists, which allows one to assess the authenticity and integrity of
   the email headers section or selected Header Fields from the domain-
   level perspective, specifically DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
   [RFC6376], as used by Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
   and Conformance (DMARC) [RFC7489].  These protocols provide a domain-
   based reputation mechanism that can be used to mitigate some forms of
   unsolicited email (spam).  At the same time, these protocols can
   provide a level of cryptographic integrity and authenticity for some
   headers, depending on how they are used.  However, integrity
   protection and proof of authenticity are both tied to the domain name
   of the sending e-mail address, not the sending address itself, so
   these protocols do not provide end-to-end protection, and are
   incapable of providing any form of confidentiality.

1.6.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.7.  Terms

   The following terms are defined for the scope of this document:

   *  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: cf. [RFC4949], which states: "A
      form of active wiretapping attack in which the attacker intercepts
      and selectively modifies communicated data to masquerade as one or
      more of the entities involved in a communication association."

      Note: Historically, MITM has stood for '_Man_-in-the-middle'.
      However, to indicate that the entity in the middle is not always a
      human attacker, MITM can also stand for 'Machine-in-the-middle' or
      'Meddler-in-the-middle'.

   *  Message: An Email Message consisting of Header Fields
      (collectively called "the Header Section of the message")
      followed, optionally, by a Body; cf. [RFC5322].

      Note: To avoid ambiguity, this document does not use the terms
      "Header" or "Headers" in isolation, but instead always uses
      "Header Field" to refer to the individual field and "Header
      Section" to refer to the entire collection; cf. [RFC5322].

   *  Header Field (HF): cf. [RFC5322] Header Fields are lines beginning
      with a field name, followed by a colon (":"), followed by a field
      body (value), and terminated by CRLF.

   *  Header Section (HS): The Header Section is a sequence of lines of
      characters with special syntax as defined in [RFC5322].  It is the
      (top) section of a Message containing the Header Fields.

   *  Body: The Body is simply a sequence of bytes that follows the
      Header Section and is separated from the Header Section by an
      empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF); cf
      [RFC5322].  It is the (bottom) section of Message containing the
      payload of a Message.  Typically, the Body consists of a (possibly
      multipart) MIME [RFC2045] construct.

   *  MIME Header Fields: Header Fields describing content of a MIME
      entity [RFC2045], in particular the MIME structure.  Each MIME
      Header Field name starts with "Content-" prefix.

   *  MIME Header Section (part): The collection of MIME Header Fields.
      "MIME Header Section" refers to a Header Sections that contains
      only MIME Header Fields, whereas "MIME Header Section part" refers
      to the MIME Header Fields of a Header Section that - in addition
      to MIME Header Fields - also contains non-MIME Header Fields.

   *  Essential Header Fields (EHF): The minimum set of Header Fields an
      Outer Message Header Section SHOULD contain; cf. Appendix C.1.2.5.

   *  Header Protection (HP): cryptographic protection of email Header
      Sections (or parts of it) for signatures and/or encryption

   *  Protection Levels (PL): The level of protection applied to a
      Message, e.g.  'signature and encryption' or 'signature only' (cf.
      Section 3.2).

   *  Protected: Portions of a message that have had any Protection
      Levels applied.

   *  Protected Message: A Message that has had any Protection Levels
      applied.

   *  Unprotected: Portions of a Message that has had no Protection
      Levels applied.

   *  Unprotected Message: A Message that has had no Protection Levels
      applied.

   *  Submission Entity: The entity which executes further processing of
      the Message (incl. transport towards the receiver), after
      protection measures have been applied to the Message.

      Note: The Submission Entity varies among implementations, mainly
      depending on the stage where protection measures are applied: E.g.
      a Message Submission Agent (MSA) [RFC6409] or another
      (proprietary) solution.  The latter is particularly relevant, if
      protection is implemented as a plugin solution.  Some
      implementations may determine the destination recipients by
      reading the To, Cc and Bcc Header Fields of the Outer Message.

   *  Original Message (OrigM): The Message to be protected before any
      protection-related processing has been applied on the sending
      side.  If the source is not a "message/rfc822" Message, OrigM is
      defined as the "virtual" Message that would be constructed for
      sending it as unprotected email.

   *  Inner Message (InnerM): The Message to be protected which has had
      wrapping and protection measures applied on the sending side OR
      the resulting Message once decryption and unwrapping on the
      receiving side has been performed.  Typically, the Inner Message
      is in clear text.  The Inner Message is a subset of (or the same
      as) the Original Message.  The Inner Message must be the same on
      the sending and the receiving side.

   *  Outer Message (OuterM): The Message as provided to the Submission
      Entity or received from the last hop respectively.  The Outer
      Message normally differs on the sending and the receiving side
      (e.g. new Header Fields are added by intermediary nodes).

   *  Receiving User Facing Message (RUFM): The Message used for
      rendering at the receiving side.  Typically this is the same as
      the Inner Message.

   *  Data Minimization: Data sparseness and hiding of all technically
      concealable information whenever possible.

   *  Cryptographic Layer, Cryptographic Payload, Cryptographic
      Envelope, Structural Headers, and MUA are all used as defined in

   *  User-Facing Headers are defined in
      [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers].

   *  Legacy MUA: a MUA that does not understand protected headers as
      described in this document.  A Legacy Non-Crypto MUA is incapable
      of doing any end-to-end cryptographic operations.  A Legacy Crypto
      MUA is capable of doing cryptographic operations, but does not
      understand or generate protected headers.

   *  Wrapped Message: The protected headers scheme that uses the
      mechanism described in [RFC8551], where the Cryptographic Payload
      is a "message/rfc822" or "message/global" MIME object.

   *  Injected Headers: The protected headers scheme that uses the
      mechanism described in [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers],
      where the protected headers are inserted on the Cryptographic
      Payload directly.

   *  Header Confidentiality Policy: documented in Section 4.1.2.2

2.  Problem Statement

   The LAMPS charter contains the following Work Item:

      Update the specification for the cryptographic protection of email
      headers -- both for signatures and encryption -- to improve the
      implementation situation with respect to privacy, security,
      usability and interoperability in cryptographically-protected
      electronic mail.  Most current implementations of
      cryptographically-protected electronic mail protect only the body
      of the message, which leaves significant room for attacks against
      otherwise-protected messages.

   In the following a set of challenges to be addressed:

   [[ TODO: Enhance this section, add more items to the following. ]]

2.1.  Privacy

   *  (Technical) Data Minimization, which includes data sparseness and
      hiding all technically concealable information whenever possible

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


2.2.  Security

   *  Prevent MITM attacks (cf.  [RFC4949])

2.3.  Usability

   *  Improved User interaction / User experience, in particular at the
      receiving side

2.4.  Interoperability

   *  Interoperability with [RFC8551] implementations

3.  Use Cases

   In the following, the reader can find a list of the generic use cases
   that need to be addressed for Messages with Header Protection (HP).
   These use cases apply regardless of technology (S/MIME, PGP/MIME,
   etc.) used to achieve HP.

3.1.  Interactions

   The following use cases assume that at least the sending side
   supports Header Protection as specified in this document.  Receiving
   sides that support this specification are expected to be able to
   distinguish between Messages that use Header Protection as specified
   in this document, and (legacy) Mail User Agents (MUAs) which do not
   implement this specification.

   [[ TODO: Verify once solution is stable and update last sentence. ]]

3.1.1.  Main Use Case

   Both the sending and receiving side (fully) support Header Protection
   as specified in this document.

   The main use case is specified in Section 4.1.

3.1.2.  Backward Compatibility Use Cases

   Regarding backward compatibility, the main distinction is based on
   whether or not the receiving side conforms to MIME according to
   [RFC2046], ff., which in particular also includes Section 2 of
   [RFC2049] on "MIME Conformance".  The following excerpt is
   contextually relevant:






Gillmor, et al.         Expires 28 November 2021               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


     A mail user agent that is MIME-conformant MUST:

     [...]

          -- Recognize and display at least the RFC822 message
          encapsulation (message/rfc822) in such a way as to
          preserve any recursive structure, that is, displaying
          or offering to display the encapsulated data in
          accordance with its media type.

          -- Treat any unrecognized subtypes as if they were
          "application/octet-stream".

     [...]

     An MUA that meets the above conditions is said to be MIME-
     conformant.  A MIME-conformant MUA is assumed to be "safe" to
     send virtually any kind of properly-marked data to users of
     such mail systems, because these systems are, at a minimum,
     capable of treating the data as undifferentiated binary, and
     will not simply splash it onto the screen of unsuspecting
     users.

   [[ TODO: The compatibility of legacy HP systems with this new
   solution, and how to handle issues surrounding future maintenance for
   these legacy systems, will be decided by the LAMPS WG. ]]

3.1.2.1.  Receiving Side MIME-Conformant

   The sending side (fully) supports Header Protection as specified in
   this document, while the receiving side does not support this
   specification.  However, the receiving side is MIME-conformant
   according to [RFC2045], ff. (cf.  Section 3.1.2).

   This use case is specified in Section 4.2.1.

   Note: This case should perform as expected if the sending side
   applies this specification as outlined in Section 4.1.

   [[ TODO: Verify once solution is stable and update last sentence. ]]

3.1.2.2.  Receiving Side Not MIME-Conformant

   The sending side (fully) supports Header Protection as specified in
   this document, while the receiving side does not support this
   specification.  Furthermore, the receiving side is *not* MIME-
   conformant according to [RFC2045], ff. (cf.  Section 3.1.2).

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   This use case is specified in Section 4.2.2.

3.2.  Protection Levels

3.2.1.  In-Scope

   The following Protection Levels are in scope for this document:

   a) Signature and encryption

   Messages containing a cryptographic signature, which are also
   encrypted.

   b) Signature only

   Messages containing a cryptographic signature, but which are not
   encrypted.

3.2.2.  Out-of-Scope

   Legacy implementations, implementations not (fully) compliant with
   this document or corner-cases may lead to further Protection Levels
   to appear on the receiving side, such as (list not exhaustive):

   *  Triple wrap

   *  Encryption only

   *  Encryption before signature

   *  Signature and encryption, but:

      -  Signature fails to validate

      -  Signature validates but the signing certificate revoked

   *  Signature only, but:

      -  with multiple valid signatures, layered atop each other

   These Protection Levels, as well as any further Protection Levels not
   listed in Section 3.2.1 are beyond the scope of this document.

4.  Specification

   This section contains the specification for Header Protection in S/
   MIME to update and clarify Section 3.1 of [RFC8551] (S/MIME 4.0).

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   Note: It is likely that PGP/MIME [RFC3156] will also incorporate this
   specification or parts of it.

   This specification applies to the Protection Levels "signature &
   encryption" and "signature only" (cf.  Section 3.2):

   Sending and receiving sides MUST implement the "signature and
   encryption" Protection Level, which SHOULD be used as default on the
   sending side.

   Certain implementations may decide to send "signature only" Messages,
   depending on the circumstances and customer requirements.  Sending
   sides MAY and receiving sides MUST implement "signature only"
   Protection Level.

   It generally is NOT RECOMMENDED to send a Message with any other
   Protection Level.  On the other hand, the receiving side must be
   prepared to receive Messages with other Protection Levels.

   [[ TODO: Further study is necessary to determine whether - and if yes
   to what extent - additional guidance for handling messages with other
   Protection Levels, e.g. "encryption only" at the receiving side
   should be included in this document. ]]

4.1.  Main Use Case

   This section applies to the main use case, where the sending and
   receiving side (fully) support Header Protection as specified herein
   (cf.  Section 3.1.1).

   Note: The sending side specification of the main use case is also
   applicable to the cases where the sending side (fully) supports
   Header Protection as specified herein, while the receiving side does
   not, but is MIME-conformant according to [RFC2045], ff. (cf.
   Section 3.1.2 and Section 3.1.2.1).

   Further backward compatibility cases are defined in Section 4.2.

4.1.1.  MIME Format

4.1.1.1.  Introduction

   As per S/MIME version 3.1 and later (cf.  [RFC8551]), the sending
   client MAY wrap a full MIME message in a message/RFC822 wrapper in
   order to apply S/MIME security services to these header fields.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   To help the receiving side to distinguish between a forwarded and a
   wrapped message, the Content-Type header field parameter "forwarded"
   is added as defined in [I-D.melnikov-iana-reg-forwarded].

   The simplified (cryptographic overhead not shown) MIME structure of
   such an Email Message looks as follows:

     <Outer Message Header Section (unprotected)>

     <Outer Message Body (protected)>

       <MIME Header Section (wrapper)>

         <Inner Message Header Section>

         <Inner Message Body>

   The following example demonstrates how an Original Message might be
   protected, i.e., the Original Message is contained as Inner Message
   in the Protected Body of an Outer Message.  It illustrates the first
   Body part (of the Outer Message) as a "multipart/signed"
   (application/pkcs7-signature) media type:

   Lines are prepended as follows:

   *  "O: " Outer Message Header Section

   *  "I: " Message Header Section

   *  "W: " Wrapper (MIME Header Section)

        Content-Type: application/pkcs7-signature

        [[base-64 encoded signature]]

        --boundary-AM--

   The Outer Message Header Section is unprotected, while the remainder
   (Outer Message Body) is protected.  The Outer Message Body consists
   of the wrapper (MIME Header Section) and the Inner Message (Header
   Section and Body).

   The wrapper is a simple MIME Header Section with media type "message/
   rfc822" containing a Content-Type header field parameter
   "forwarded=no" followed by an empty line.

   If the source is an Original (message/rfc822) Message, the Inner
   Message Header Section is typically the same as (or a subset of) the
   Original Message Header Section, and the Inner Message Body is
   typically the same as the Original Message Body.

   The Inner Message itself may contain any MIME structure.

   Note: It is still to be decided by the LAMPS WG whether or not to
   recommend an alternative MIME format as described in Appendix C.1.1.1
   (instead of the currently standardized and above defined format).

4.1.2.  Sending Side

   This section describes the process an MUA should use to apply
   cryptographic protection to an e-mail message with header protection.
   We start by describing the legacy message composition process as a
   baseline.

4.1.2.1.  Composing a Cryptographically-Protected Message Without Header
          Protection

   [I-D.dkg-lamps-e2e-mail-guidance] describes the typical process for a
   legacy crypto MUA to apply cryptographic protections to an e-mail
   message.  That guidance and terminology is replicated here for
   reference:

   *  "origbody": the traditional unprotected message body as a well-
      formed MIME tree (possibly just a single MIME leaf part).  As a
      well-formed MIME tree, "origbody" already has structural headers
      ("Content-*") present.

   *  "origheaders": the intended non-structural headers for the
      message, represented here as a list of "(h,v)" pairs, where "h" is
      a header field name and "v" is the associated value.  Note that
      these are header fields that the MUA intends to be visible to the
      recipient of the message.  In particular, if the MUA uses the
      "Bcc" header during composition, but plans to omit it from the
      message (see section 3.6.3 of [RFC5322]), it will not be in
      "origheaders".

   *  "crypto": The series of cryptographic protections to apply (for
      example, "sign with the secret key corresponding to X.509
      certificate X, then encrypt to X.509 certificates X and Y").  This
      is a routine that accepts a MIME tree as input (the Cryptographic
      Payload), wraps the input in the appropriate Cryptographic
      Envelope, and returns the resultant MIME tree as output.

   The algorithm returns a MIME object that is ready to be injected into
   the mail system:

   *  Apply "crypto" to "origbody", yielding MIME tree "output"

   *  For each header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


      -  Add header "h" of "output" with value "v"

   *  Return "output"

4.1.2.2.  Header Confidentiality Policy

   When composing an encrypted message with protected headers, the
   composing MUA needs a Header Confidentialiy Policy.  In this
   document, we represent that Header Confidentiality Policy as a
   function "hcp":

   *  "hcp(name, val_in) --> val_out": this function takes a header
      field name "name" and initial value "val_in" as arguments, and
      returns a replacement header value "val_out".  If "val_out" is the
      special value "null", it mean that the header in question should
      be omitted from the set of headers visible outside the
      Cryptographic Envelope.

   For example, an MUA that only obscures the "Subject" header field by
   replacing it with the literal string "[...]" and does not offer
   confidentiality to any other header fields would be represented as
   (in pseudocode):

   "hcp(name, val_in) --> val_out: if name is 'Subject': return '[...]'
   else: return val_in"

   Note that such a policy is only needed when the end-to-end
   protections include encryption (confidentiality).  No comparable
   policy is needed for other end-to-end cryptographic protections
   (integrity and authenticity), as they are simply uniformly applied so
   that all header fields known by the sender have these protections.

   This asymmetry is an unfortunate consequence of complexities in
   message delivery systems, some of which may reject, drop, or delay
   messages where all headers are removed from the top-level MIME
   object.

   This document does not mandate any particular Header Confidentiality
   Policy, though it offers guidance for MUA implementers in selecting
   one in Section 4.1.3.  Future documents may recommend or mandate such
   a policy for an MUA with specific needs.  Such a recommendation might
   be motivated by descriptions of metadata-derived attacks, or stem
   from research about message deliverability, or describe new
   signalling mechanisms, but these topics are out of scope for this
   document.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


4.1.2.3.  Composing with "Wrapped Message" Header Protection

   To compose a message using "Wrapped Message" header protection, we
   use those inputs described in Section 4.1.2.1 plus the Header
   Confidentiality Policy "hcp" defined in Section 4.1.2.2.  The new
   algorithm is:

   *  For header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

      -  Add header "h" of "origbody" with value "v"

   *  If any of the header fields in "origbody", including headers in
      the nested internal MIME structure, contain any 8-bit UTF-8
      characters (see section section 3.7 of [RFC6532]):

      -  Let "payload" be a new MIME part with one header: "Content-
         Type: message/global; forwarded=no", and whose body is
         "origbody".

   *  Else:

      -  Let "payload" be a new MIME part with one header: "Content-
         Type: message/rfc822; forwarded=no", and whose body is
         "origbody".

   *  Apply "crypto" to "payload", yielding MIME tree "output"

   *  If "crypto" contains encryption:

      -  Create new empty list of header field names and values "newh"

      -  For header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

         o  Let "newval" be "hcp(h, v)"

         o  If "newval" is not "null":

            +  Append "(h,newval)" to "newh"

      -  Set "origheaders" to "newh"

   *  For header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

      -  Add header "h" of "output" with value "v"

   *  Return "output"

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   Note that the Header Confidentiality Policy "hcp" is ignored if
   "crypto" does not contain encryption.  This is by design.

4.1.2.4.  Composing with "Injected Headers" Header Protection

   To compose a message using "Injected Headers" header protection, the
   composing MUA needs one additional input in addition to the Header
   Confidentiality Policy "hcp" defined in Section 4.1.2.2.

   *  "legacy": a boolean value, indicating whether any recipient of the
      message is believed to have a legacy client.  If all recipients
      are known to implement this draft, "legacy" should be set to
      "false".  (How a MUA determines the value of "legacy" is out of
      scope for this document; an initial implementation can simply set
      it to "true")

   The revised algorithm for applying cryptographic protection to a
   message is as follows:

   *  Create a new MIME leaf part "legacydisplay" with header "Content-
      Type: text/plain; protected-headers="v1"" and an empty body.

   *  if "crypto" contains encryption, and "legacy" is "true":

      -  For each header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

         o  If "h" is user-facing (see
            [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers]):

            +  If "hcp(h,v)" is not "v":

               *  Add "h: v" to the body of "legacydisplay".  For
                  example, if "h" is "Subject", and "v" is "lunch
                  plans?", then add the line "Subject: lunch plans?" to
                  the body of "legacydisplay"

   *  If the body of "legacydisplay" is empty:

      -  Let "payload" be MIME part "origbody", discarding
         "legacydisplay"

   *  Else: (body of "legacydisplay" is not empty)

      -  Construct a new MIME part "wrapper" with "Content-Type:
         multipart/mixed"

      -  Give "wrapper" exactly two subparts: "legacydisplay" and
         "origbody", in that order.

      -  Let "payload" be MIME part "wrapper"

   *  For each header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

      -  Add header "h" of MIME part "payload" with value "v"

   *  Set the "protected-headers" parameter on the "Content-Type" of
      "payload" to "v1"

   *  Apply "crypto" to "payload", producing MIME tree "output"

   *  If "crypto" contains encryption:

      -  Create new empty list of header field names and values "newh"

      -  For header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

         o  Let "newval" be "hcp(h, v)"

         o  If "newval" is not "null":

            +  Add "newh[h]" to "newval"

      -  Set "origheaders" to "newh"

   *  For each header name and value "(h,v)" in "origheaders":

      -  Add header "h" of "output" with value "v"

   *  Return "output"

   Note that both new parameters ("hcp" and "legacy") are effectively
   ignored if "crypto" does not contain encryption.  This is by design,
   because they are irrelevant for signed-only cryptographic
   protections.

4.1.2.5.  Choosing Between Wrapped Message and Injected Headers

   When composing a message with end-to-end cryptographic protections,
   an MUA SHOULD protect the headers of that message as well as the
   body.

   An MUA MAY protect the headers of any outbound message using either
   the "Wrapped Message" or the "Injected Headers" style of protection.
   See Section 4.2 for more discussion about reasons to choose one
   mechanism or another.

   [[ TODO: this document should recommend generation of one particular
   scheme by default for new implementers ]]

4.1.3.  Default Header Confidentiality Policy

   An MUA SHOULD have a sensible default Header Confidentiality Policy,
   and SHOULD NOT require the user to select one.

   The default Header Confidentiality Policy SHOULD provide
   confidentiality for the "Subject" header field by replacing it with
   the literal string "[...]".  Most users treat the Subject of a
   message the same way that they treat the body, and they are surprised
   to find that the Subject of an encrypted message is visible.

   [[ TODO: select one of the two policies below the recommended default
   ]]

4.1.3.1.  Minimalist Header Confidentiality Policy

   Accordingly, the most conservative recommended Header Confidentiality
   Policy only protects the "Subject":

   "hcp_minimal(name, val_in) --> val_out: if name is 'Subject': return
   '[...]' else: return val_in"

4.1.3.2.  Strong Header Confidentiality Policy

   Alternately, a more aggressive (and therefore more privacy-
   preserving) Header Confidentiality Policy only leaks a handful of
   fields whose absence is known to increase rates of delivery failure,
   and simultaneously obscures the "Message-ID" behind a random new one:

   "hcp_strong(name, val_in) --> val_out: if name in ['From', 'To',
   'Cc', 'Date']: return val_in else if name is 'Subject': return
   '[...]' else if name is 'Message-ID': return
   generate_new_message_id() else: return null"

   The function "generate_new_message_id()" represents whatever process
   the MUA typically uses to generate a "Message-ID" for a new outbound
   message.

4.1.3.3.  Offering Stronger Header Confidentiality

   A MUA MAY offer even stronger confidentiality for headers of an
   encrypted message than described in Section 4.1.3.2.  For example, it
   might implement an HCP that obfuscates the "From" field, or omits the
   "Cc" field, or ensures "Date" is represented in "UTC" (obscuring the
   local timezone).

   The authors of this document hope that implementers with deployment
   experience will document their chosen Header Confidentiality Policy
   and the rationale behind their choice.

4.1.4.  Receiving Side

   An MUA that receives a cryptographically-protected e-mail will render
   it for the user.

   The receiving MUA will render the message body, a selected subset of
   header fields, and (as described in
   [I-D.dkg-lamps-e2e-mail-guidance]) provide a summary of the
   cryptographic properties of the message.

   Most MUAs only render a subset of header fields by default.  For
   example, few MUAs typically render "Message-Id" or "Received" header
   fields for the user, but most do render "From", "To", "Cc", "Date",
   and "Subject".

   A MUA that knows how to handle a message with protected headers makes
   the following two changes to its behavior when rendering a message:

   *  If it detects that an incoming message had protected headers, it
      renders header fields for the message from the protected headers,
      ignoring the external (unprotected) headers.

   *  It includes information in the message's cryptographic summary to
      indicate the types of protection that applied to each rendered
      header field (if any).

   A MUA that handles protected headers does _not_ need to render any
   new header fields that it did not render before.

4.1.4.1.  Identifying that a Message has Protected Headers

   An incoming message can be identified as having protected headers
   based on one of two signals:

   *  The Cryptographic Payload has "Content-Type: message/rfc822" or
      "Content-Type: message/global" and the parameter "forwarded" has a
      value of "no".  See Section 4.1.4.3 for rendering guidance.

   *  The Cryptographic Payload has some other "Content-Type" and it has
      parameter "protected-headers" set to "v1".  See Section 4.1.4.4
      for rendering guidance.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   Messages of both types exist in the wild, and a sensible MUA should
   be able to handle them both.  They provide the same semantics and the
   same meaning.

4.1.4.2.  Updating the Cryptographic Summary

   Regardless of whether a cryptographically-protected message has
   protected headers, the cryptographic summary of the message should be
   modified to indicate what protections the headers have.

   Each header individually has exactly one the following protections:

   *  "unprotected" (this is the case for all headers in messages that
      have no protected headers)

   *  "signed-only" (bound into the same validated signature as the
      enclosing message, but also visible in transit)

   *  "encrypted-only" (only appears within the cryptographic payload;
      the corresponding external header was either omitted or
      obfuscated)

   *  "encrypted-and-signed" (same as encrypted, but additionally is
      under a validatd signature)

   Note that while the message itself may be "encrypted-and-signed",
   some headers may be replicated on the outside of the message (e.g.
   "Date") Those headers would be "signed-only", despite the message
   itself being "encrypted-and-signed".

   Rendering this information is likely to be complex and messy ---
   users may not understand it.  It is beyond the scope of this document
   to suggest any specific graphical affordances or user experience.
   Future work should include examples of successful rendering of this
   information.

4.1.4.3.  Rendering a Wrapped Message

   When the Cryptographic Payload has "Content-Type" of "message/rfc822"
   or "message/global", and the parameter "forwarded" is set to "no",
   the values of the protected headers are drawn from the headers of the
   Cryptographic Payload, and the body that is rendered is the body of
   the Cryptographic Payload.

4.1.4.3.1.  Example Signed-Only Wrapped Message

   Consider a message with this structure, where the MUA is able to
   validate the cryptographic signature:

   The message body should be rendered the same way as this message:

   C └┬╴multipart/alternative
   D  ├─╴text/plain
   E  └─╴text/html

   It should render header fields taken from part "C".

   Its cryptographic summary should indicates that the message was
   signed and all rendered header fields were included in the signature.

   The MUA SHOULD ignore header fields from part "A" for the purposes of
   rendering.

   Its cryptographic summary should indicates that the message was
   signed and encrypted.  Each rendered header field found in "I" should
   be compared against the header field of the same name from "F".  If
   the value found in "F" matches the value found in "I", the header
   field should be marked as "signed-only".  If no matching header field
   was found in "F", or the value found did not match the value from
   "I", the header field should be marked as "signed-and-encrypted".

4.1.4.4.  Rendering a Message with Injected Headers

   When the Cryptographic Payload does not have a "Content-Type" of
   "message/rfc822" or "message/global", and the parameter "protected-
   headers" is set to "v1", the values of the protected headers are
   drawn from the headers of the Cryptographic Payload, and the body
   that is rendered is the Cryptographic Payload itself.

   It should render header fieldss taken from part "M".

   Its cryptographic summary should indicates that the message was

   It should render headers taken from part "R".

   Its cryptographic summary should indicates that the message was
   signed and encrypted.  As in Section 4.1.4.3.2, each rendered header
   field found in "R" should be compared against the header field of the
   same name from "P".  If the value found in "P" matches the value
   found in "R", the header field should be marked as "signed-only".  If
   no matching header field was found in "P", or the value found did not
   match the value from "R", the header field should be marked as
   "signed-and-encrypted".

4.1.4.4.3.  Do Not Render Legacy Display Part

   As described [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers], a message with
   cryptographic confidentiality protection MAY include a "Legacy
   Display" part for backward-compatibility with legacy MUAs

   The receiving MUA SHOULD avoid rendering the Legacy Display part to
   the user at all, since it is aware of and can render the actual
   Protected Headers.

   If a Legacy Display part is detected, it and its enclosing
   "multipart/mixed" wrapper should be discarded before rendering.

4.1.4.4.3.1.  Legacy Display Detection Algorithm

   A receiving MUA acting on a message SHOULD detect the presence of a
   Legacy Display part and the corresponding "original body" with the
   following simple algorithm:

   *  Check that all of the following are true for the message:

   *  The Cryptographic Envelope must contain an encrypting
      Cryptographic Layer



Gillmor, et al.         Expires 28 November 2021               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   *  The Cryptographic Payload must have a "Content-Type" of
      "multipart/mixed"

   *  The Cryptographic Payload must have exactly two subparts

   *  The first subpart of the Cryptographic Payload must have a
      "Content-Type" of "text/plain" or "text/rfc822-headers"

   *  The first subpart of the Cryptographic Payload's "Content-Type"
      must contain a property of "protected-headers", and its value must
      be "v1".

   *  If all of the above are true, then the first subpart is the Legacy
      Display part, and the second subpart is the "original body".
      Otherwise, the message does not have a Legacy Display part.

4.1.4.4.3.2.  Legacy Display Example

   Consider a message with this structure, where the MUA is able to
   validate the cryptographic signature:

   U └─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="enveloped-data"
      ↧ (decrypts to)
   V  └─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="signed-data"
       ⇩ (unwraps to)
   W   └┬╴multipart/mixed [Cryptographic Payload]
   X    ├─╴text/plain [Legacy Display]
   Y    └┬╴multipart/alternative [Rendered Body]
   Z     ├─╴text/plain
   A'    └─╴text/html

   The message body should be rendered the same way as this message,
   effectively hiding the Legacy Display part ("X") and its wrapper:

   Y └┬╴multipart/alternative
   Z  ├─╴text/plain
   A' └─╴text/html

   It should render headers taken from part "W", following the same
   guidance as in Section 4.1.4.4.2 and Section 4.1.4.3.2 about the
   cryptographic status of each rendered header field.

4.1.4.5.  Affordances for Debugging and Troubleshooting

   Note that advanced users of an MUA may need access to the original
   message, for example to troubleshoot problems with the MUA itself, or
   problems with the SMTP transport path taken by the message.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   A MUA that applies these rendering guidelines SHOULD ensure that the
   full original source of the message as it was received remains
   available to such a user for debugging and troubleshooting.

4.1.4.6.  Composing a Reply to an Encrypted Message with Protected
          Headers

   When composing a reply to an encrypted message with protected
   headers, the MUA is acting both as a receiving MUA and as a sending
   MUA.  Special guidance applies here, as things can go wrong in at
   least two ways: leaking previously-confidential information, and
   replying to the wrong party.

4.1.4.6.1.  Avoid Leaking Encrypted Headers in Reply

   As noted in [I-D.dkg-lamps-e2e-mail-guidance], an MUA in this
   position MUST NOT leak previously-encrypted content in the clear in a
   followup message.  The same is true for protected headers.

   Values from any header field that was identified as either
   "encrypted" or "signed-and-encrypted" based on the steps outlined
   above MUST NOT be placed in cleartext output when generating a
   message.

   In particular, if "Subject" was encrypted, and it is copied into the
   draft encrypted reply, the replying MUA MUST obfuscate the "Subject"
   field in the cleartext header as described above.

   [[ TODO: formally describe how a replying MUA should generate a
   message-specific Header Protection policy based on the cryptographic
   status of the headers of the incoming message ]]

4.1.4.6.2.  Avoid Misdirected Replies to Encrypted Messages with
            Protected Headers

   When replying to a message, the Composing MUA typically decides who
   to send the reply to based on:

   *  the "Reply-To", "Mail-Followup-To", or "From" headers

   *  optionally, the other "To" or "Cc" headers (if the user chose to
      "reply all")

   When a message has protected headers, the replying MUA MUST populate
   the destination fields of the draft message using the protected
   headers, and ignore any unprotected headers.

   This mitigates against an attack where Mallory gets a copy of an
   encrypted message from Alice to Bob, and then replays the message to
   Bob with an additional "Cc" to Mallory's own e-mail address in the
   message's outer header.

   If Bob knows Mallory's certificate already, and he replies to such a
   message without following the guidance in this section, it's likely
   that his MUA will encrypt the cleartext of the message directly to
   Mallory.

4.1.4.7.  Implicitly-rendered Header Fields

   While "From" and "To" and "Cc" and "Subject" and "Date" are often
   explicitly rendered to the user, some header fields do affect message
   display, without being explicitly rendered.

   For example, "Message-Id", "References", and "In-Reply-To" header
   fields may collectively be used to place a message in a "thread" or
   series of messages.

   In another example, Section 4.1.4.6.2 observes that the value of the
   "Reply-To" field can influence the draft reply message.  So while the
   user may never see the "Reply-To" header directly, it is implicitly
   "rendered" when the user interacts with the message by replying to
   it.

   An MUA that depends on any implicitly-rendered header field in a
   message with protected headers SHOULD use the value from the
   protected header, and SHOULD NOT use any value found outside the
   cryptographic protection.

4.1.4.8.  Unprotected Headers Added in Transit

   Some headers are legitimately added in transit, and could not have
   been known to the sender at message composition time.

   The most common of these headers are "Received" and "DKIM-Signature",
   neither of which are typically rendered, either explicitly or
   implicitly.

   If a receiving MUA has specific knowledge about a given header field,
   including that:

   *  the header field would not have been known to the original sender,
      and

   *  the header field might be rendered explicitly or implicitly,

   then the MUA MAY decide to operate on the value of that header field
   from the unprotected header section, even though the message has
   protected headers.

   The MUA MAY prefer to verify that the headers in question have
   additional transit-derived cryptographic protections (e.g., to test
   whether they are covered by a valid "DKIM-Signature") before
   rendering or acting on them.

   Specific examples appear below.

4.1.4.8.1.  Mailing list headers: List-* and Archived-At

   If the message arrives through a mailing list, the list manager
   itself may inject headers (most of which start with "List-") in the
   message:

   *  "List-Archive"

   *  "List-Subscribe"

   *  "List-Unsubscribe"

   *  "List-Id"

   *  "List-Help"

   *  "List-Post"

   *  "Archived-At"

   For some MUAs, these headers are implicitly rendered, by providing
   buttons for actions like "Subscribe", "View Archived Version", "Reply
   List", "List Info", etc.

   An MUA that receives a message with protected headers that contains
   these header fields in the unprotected section, and that has reason
   to believe the message is coming through a mailing list MAY decide to
   render them to the user (explicitly or implicitly) even though they
   are not protected.

   FIXME: other examples of unprotected transit headers?

4.2.1.  Receiving Side MIME-Conformant

   This section applies to the case where the sending side (fully)
   supports Header Protection as specified in this document, while the
   receiving side does not support this specification, but is MIME-
   conformant according to [RFC2045], ff. (cf.  Section 3.1.2 and
   Section 3.1.2.1)

   The sending side specification of the main use case (cf.
   Section 4.1) MUST ensure that receiving sides can still recognize and
   display or offer to display the encapsulated data in accordance with
   its media type (cf.  [RFC2049], Section 2).  In particular, receiving
   sides that do not support this specification, but are MIME-conformant
   according to [RFC2045], ff. can still recognize and display the
   Message intended for the user.

   [[ TODO: Verify once solution is stable and update last sentence. ]]

4.2.2.  Receiving Side Not MIME-Conformant

   This section applies to cases where the sending side (fully) supports
   Header Protection as specified in this document, while the receiving
   side neither supports this specification *nor* is MIME-conformant
   according to [RFC2045], ff. (cf.  Section 3.1.2 and Section 3.1.2.2).

   [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers] describes a possible way to
   achieve backward compatibility with existing S/MIME (and PGP/MIME)
   implementations that predate this specification and are not MIME-
   conformant (Legacy Display) either.  It mainly focuses on email
   clients that do not render emails which utilize header protection in
   a user friendly manner, which may confuse the user.  While this has
   been observed occasionally in PGP/MIME (cf.  [RFC3156]), the extent
   of this problem with S/MIME implementations is still unclear.  (Note:
   At this time, none of the samples in
   [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers] apply header protection as
   specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC8551], which is wrapping as Media
   Type "message/RFC822".)

   Should serious backward compatibility issues with rendering at the
   receiving side be discovered, the Legacy Display format described in
   [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers] may serve as a basis to
   mitigate those issues (cf.  Section 4.2).

   Another variant of backward compatibility has been implemented by pEp
   [I-D.pep-email], i.e. pEp Email Format 1.0.  At this time pEp has
   implemented this for PGP/MIME, but not yet S/MIME.

Appendix A.  Test Vectors

   This section contains sample messages using the different schemes
   described in this document.  Each sample contains a MIME object, a
   textual and diagrammatic view of its structure, and examples of how
   an MUA might render it.

   The cryptographic protections used in this document use the S/MIME
   standard, and keying material and certificates come from
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-samples].

   These messages should be accessible to any IMAP client at
   "imap://bob@header-protection.cmrg.net/" (any password should
   authenticate to this read-only IMAP mailbox).

   You can also download copies of these test vectors separately at
   "https://header-protection.cmrg.net".

   If any of the messages downloaded differ from those offered here,
   this document is the canonical source.

A.1.  Baseline Messages

   These messages offer no header protection at all, and can be used as
   a baseline.  They are provided in this document as a counterexample.
   An MUA implementer can use these messages to verify that the reported
   cryptographic summary of the message indicates no header protection.

A.1.1.  No cryptographic protections over a simple message

   This message uses no cryptographic protection at all.  Its body is a
   text/plain message.

   It has the following structure:

   └─╴text/plain 152 bytes

   Its contents are:

Appendix B.  Additional information

B.1.  Stored Variants of Messages with Bcc

   Messages containing at least one recipient address in the Bcc header
   field may appear in up to three different variants:

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   1.  The Message for the recipient addresses listed in To or Cc header
       fields, which must not include the Bcc header field neither for
       signature calculation nor for encryption.

   2.  The Message(s) sent to the recipient addresses in the Bcc header
       field, which depends on the implementation:

       a) One Message for each recipient in the Bcc header field
       separately, with a Bcc header field containing only the address
       of the recipient it is sent to.

       b) The same Message for each recipient in the Bcc header field
       with a Bcc header field containing an indication such as
       "Undisclosed recipients", but no addresses.

       c) The same Message for each recipient in the Bcc header field
       which does not include a Bcc header field (this Message is
       identical to 1. / cf. above).

   3.  The Message stored in the 'Sent'-Folder of the sender, which
       usually contains the Bcc unchanged from the original Message,
       i.e., with all recipient addresses.

   The most privacy preserving method of the alternatives (2a, 2b, and
   2c) is to standardize 2a, as in the other cases (2b and 2c),
   information about hidden recipients is revealed via keys.  In any
   case, the Message has to be cloned and adjusted depending on the
   recipient.

Appendix C.  Text Moved from Above

   Note: Per an explicit request by the chair of the LAMPS WG to only
   present one option for the specification, the following text has been
   stripped from the main body of the draft.  It is preserved in an
   Appendix for the time being and may be moved back to the main body or
   deleted, depending on the decision of the LAMPS WG.

C.1.  MIME Format

   Currently there are two options in discussion:

   1.  The option according to the current S/MIME specification (cf.
       [RFC8551])

   2.  An alternative option that is based on the former "memory hole"
       approach (cf.  [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers])

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


C.1.1.  S/MIME Specification

   Note: This is currently described in the main part of this document.

C.1.1.1.  Alternative Option Autocrypt "Protected Headers" (Ex-"Memory
          Hole")

   An alternative option (based on the former autocrypt "Memory Hole"
   approach) to be considered, is described in
   [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers].

   Unlike the option described in Appendix C.1.1, this option does not
   use a "message/RFC822" wrapper to unambiguously delimit the Inner
   Message.

   Before choosing this option, the following two issues must be
   assessed to ensure no interoperability issues result from it:

   1.  How current MIME parser implementations treat non-MIME Header
       Fields, which are not part of the outermost MIME entity and not
       part of a Message wrapped into a MIME entity of media type
       "message/rfc822", and how such Messages are rendered to the user.

       [I-D.autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers] provides some examples
       for testing this.

   2.  MIME-conformance, i.e. whether or not this option is (fully)
       MIME-conformant [RFC2045] ff., in particular also Section 5.1. of
       [RFC2046] on "Multipart Media Type).  In the following an excerpt
       of paragraphs that may be relevant in this context:

         The only header fields that have defined meaning for body parts
         are those the names of which begin with "Content-".  All other
         header fields may be ignored in body parts.  Although they
         should generally be retained if at all possible, they may be
         discarded by gateways if necessary.  Such other fields are
         permitted to appear in body parts but must not be depended on.
         "X-" fields may be created for experimental or private
         purposes, with the recognition that the information they
         contain may be lost at some gateways.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


         NOTE:  The distinction between an RFC 822 Message and a body
         part is subtle, but important.  A gateway between Internet and
         X.400 mail, for example, must be able to tell the difference
         between a body part that contains an image and a body part
         that contains an encapsulated Message, the body of which is a
         JPEG image.  In order to represent the latter, the body part
         must have "Content-Type: message/rfc822", and its body (after
         the blank line) must be the encapsulated Message, with its own
         "Content-Type: image/jpeg" header field.  The use of similar
         syntax facilitates the conversion of Messages to body parts,
         and vice versa, but the distinction between the two must be
         understood by implementors.  (For the special case in which
         parts actually are Messages, a "digest" subtype is also
         defined.)

   The MIME structure of an Email Message looks as follows:

     <Outer Message Header Section (unprotected)>

     <Outer Message Body (protected)>

       <Inner Message Header Section>

       <Inner Message Body>

   The following example demonstrates how an Original Message might be
   protected, i.e., the Original Message is contained as Inner Message
   in the Protected Body of an Outer Message.  It illustrates the first
   Body part (of the Outer Message) as a "multipart/signed"
   (application/pkcs7-signature) media type:

   Lines are prepended as follows:

   *  "O: " Outer Message Header Section

   *  "I: " Message Header Section

        --boundary-AM--

   The Outer Message Header Section is unprotected, while the remainder
   (Outer Message Body) is protected.  The Outer Message Body consists
   of the Inner Message (Header Section and Body).

   The Inner Message Header Section is the same as (or a subset of) the
   Original Message Header Section.

   The Inner Message Body is the same as the Original Message Body.

   The Original Message itself may contain any MIME structure.

C.1.2.  Sending Side

   To ease explanation, the following describes the case where an
   Original (message/rfc822) Message to be protected is present.  If
   this is not the case, Original Message means the (virtual) Message
   that would be constructed for sending it as unprotected email.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


C.1.2.1.  Inner Message Header Fields

   It is RECOMMENDED that the Inner Message contains all Header Fields
   of the Original Message with the exception of the following Header
   Field, which MUST NOT be included within the Inner Message nor within
   any other protected part of the Message:

   *  Bcc

   [[ TODO: Bcc handling needs to be further specified (see also
   Appendix B.1).  Certain MUAs cannot properly decrypt Messages with
   Bcc recipients. ]]

C.1.2.2.  Wrapper

   The wrapper is a simple MIME Header Section followed by an empty line
   preceding the Inner Message (inside the Outer Message Body).  The
   media type of the wrapper MUST be "message/RFC822" and MUST contain
   the Content-Type header field parameter "forwarded=no" as defined in
   [I-D.melnikov-iana-reg-forwarded].  The wrapper unambiguously
   delimits the Inner Message from the rest of the Message.

C.1.2.3.  Cryptographic Layers / Envelope

   [[ TODO: Basically refer to S/MIME standards ]]

C.1.2.4.  Sending Side Message Processing

   For a protected Message the following steps are applied before a
   Message is handed over to the Submission Entity:

C.1.2.4.1.  Step 1: Decide on Protection Level and Information
            Disclosure

   The implementation which applies protection to a Message must decide:

   *  Which Protection Level (signature and/or encryption) shall be
      applied to the Message?  This depends on user request and/or local
      policy as well as availability of cryptographic keys.

   *  Which Header Fields of the Original Message shall be part of the
      Outer Message Header Section?  This typically depends on local
      policy.  By default, the Essential Header Fields are part of the
      Outer Message Header Section; cf. Appendix C.1.2.5.







Gillmor, et al.         Expires 28 November 2021              [Page 162]

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   *  Which of these Header Fields are to be obfuscated?  This depends
      on local policy and/or specific Privacy requirements of the user.
      By default only the Subject Header Field is obfuscated; cf.
      Appendix C.1.2.5.

C.1.2.4.2.  Step 2: Compose the Outer Message Header Section

   Depending on the decision in Appendix C.1.2.4.1, the implementation
   shall compose the Outer Message Header Section.  (Note that this also
   includes the necessary MIME Header Section part for the following
   protection layer.)

   Outer Header Fields that are not obfuscated should contain the same
   values as in the Original Message (except for MIME Header
   Section part, which depends on the Protection Level selected in
   Appendix C.1.2.4.1).

C.1.2.4.3.  Step 3: Apply Protection to the Original Message

   Depending on the Protection Level selected in Appendix C.1.2.4.1, the
   implementation applies signature and/or encryption to the Original
   Message, including the wrapper (as per [RFC8551]), and sets the
   resulting package as the Outer Message Body.

   The resulting (Outer) Message is then typically handed over to the
   Submission Entity.

   [[ TODO: Example ]]

C.1.2.5.  Outer Message Header Fields

C.1.2.5.1.  Encrypted Messages

   To maximize Privacy, it is strongly RECOMMENDED to follow the
   principle of Data Minimization (cf.  Section 2.1).

   However, the Outer Message Header Section SHOULD contain the
   Essential Header Fields and, in addition, MUST contain the Header
   Fields of the MIME Header Section part to describe Cryptographic
   Layer of the protected MIME subtree as per [RFC8551].

   The following Header Fields are defined as the Essential Header
   Fields:

   *  From

   *  To (if present in the Original Message)




Gillmor, et al.         Expires 28 November 2021              [Page 163]

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   *  Cc (if present in the Original Message)

   *  Bcc (if present in the Original Message, see also Appendix B.1)

   *  Date

   *  Message-ID

   *  Subject

   Further processing by the Submission Entity normally depends on part
   of these Header Fields, e.g.  From and Date HFs are required by
   [RFC5322].  Furthermore, not including certain Header Fields may
   trigger spam detection to flag the Message, and/or lead to user
   experience (UX) issues.

   For further Data Minimization, the value of the Subject Header Field
   SHOULD be obfuscated as follows:

   * Subject: [...]

   and it is RECOMMENDED to replace the Message-ID by a new randomly
   generated Message-ID.

   In addition, the value of other Essential Header Fields MAY be
   obfuscated.

   Non-Essential Header Fields SHOULD be omitted from the Outer Message
   Header Section where possible.  If Non-essential Header Fields are
   included in the Outer Message Header Section, those MAY be obfuscated
   too.

   Header Fields that are not obfuscated should contain the same values
   as in the Original Message.

   If an implementation obfuscates the From, To, and/or Cc Header
   Fields, it may need to provide access to the clear text content of
   these Header Fields to the Submission Entity for processing purposes.
   This is particularly relevant, if proprietary Submission Entities are
   used.  Obfuscation of Header Fields may adversely impact spam
   filtering.

   (A use case for obfuscation of all Outer Message Header Fields is
   routing email through the use of onion routing or mix networks, e.g.
   [pEp.mixnet].)

Internet-Draft          Header Protection S/MIME                May 2021


   The MIME Header Section part is the collection of MIME Header Fields
   describing the following MIME structure as defined in [RFC2045].  A
   MIME Header Section part typically includes the following Header
   Fields:

   *  Content-Type

   *  Content-Transfer-Encoding

   *  Content-Disposition

   The following example shows the MIME Header Section part of an S/MIME
   signed Message (using application/pkcs7-mime with SignedData):

      MIME-Version: 1.0
      Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=signed-data;
         name=smime.p7m
      Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
      Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=smime.p7m

   Depending on the scenario, further Header Fields MAY be exposed in
   the Outer Message Header Section, which is NOT RECOMMENDED unless
   justified.  Such Header Fields may include e.g.:

   *  References

   *  Reply-To

   *  In-Reply-To

C.1.2.5.2.  Unencrypted Messages

   The Outer Message Header Section of unencrypted Messages SHOULD
   contain at least the Essential Header Fields and, in addition, MUST
   contain the Header Fields of the MIME Header Section part to describe
   Cryptographic Layer of the protected MIME subtree as per [RFC8551].
   It may contain further Header Fields, in particular those also
   present in the Inner Message Header Section.
