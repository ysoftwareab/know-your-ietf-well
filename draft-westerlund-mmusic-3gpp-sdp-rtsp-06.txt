2.  Introduction

   3GPP has specified the Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) that
   uses both RTSP [RFC2326] and SDP [RFC4566]. The service is specified
   in technical specifications TS 26.233 [PSS-233] and TS 26.234 [PSS-
   234] in Release 4 and later releases. The basic service defined in
   Release 4 is enhanced in Release 5 with capability exchange and in
   Release 6 with a number of features, such as adaptation, digital
   rights management, progressive download as well as a streaming
   server file-format defined in [PSS-3GP]. Fast start-up and content
   switching are addressed in Release 7.

   3GPP has also specified the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
   (MBMS) that uses SDP. The IP layer protocols used by this service
   are specified in technical specification TS 26.346 Release 6 [MBMS].
   Release 7 extends the MBMS User Service to also work with unicast
   bearers for interactive and streaming traffic classes.

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008



   In the process of defining these services, there has occasionally
   been the need to extend both SDP and RTSP functionality. These
   extensions have mostly been in the form of SDP attributes and RTSP
   headers and option tags.  3GPP uses the name option tags (like RTSP
   2.0 for what RTSP 1.0 calls option tags, option tag is the name that
   will be used in this document.  The purpose of this informational
   document is to register these SDP and RTSP extensions, in order to
   avoid future conflicts, and also to raise the awareness of their
   existence within IETF.

   This document defines in Section 5.4 three SDP protocol identifiers
   used in MBMS to enable the usage of block-based FEC. The other SDP
   and RTSP extensions registered by this document are not normatively
   defined in this document. Instead the normative definitions are
   referenced by the registrations.

   The document begins with two chapters presenting the different
   extensions of SDP for PSS and MBMS, respectively, followed by a
   section noting that offer/answer considerations are not applicable
   here. The subsequent section presents the extensions of RTSP for
   PSS. The IANA registration of SDP attributes and protocol
   identifiers is given in section 8.1, and the RTSP headers and option
   tags in section 8.2. For normative descriptions of all SDP and RTSP
   extensions we refer to TS 26.234 [PSS-234] and TS 26.346 [MBMS].


3.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes 3GPP-defined extensions to SDP [RFC4566] and
   RTSP [RFC2326] and registers attributes that are normatively defined
   in 3GPP technical specifications 26.234, 26.244 and 26.346 up to the
   referenced versions of the respective documents.

   They have only been defined with the usage within the service that
   defines them in mind. The applicability for usage outside of these
   services has not been considered or addressed. Usage of these
   attributes in other contexts may require further definitions or
   clarifications. For example, all SDP attributes lack offer/answer
   usage rules [RFC3264] which currently makes it impossible to use
   them with offer/answer. Please note that change control of these SDP
   and RTSP extensions belongs to 3GPP.

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008


4.  PSS SDP Extensions

   The PSS specification [PSS-234] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes. They are informatively listed
   below grouped by purpose. The text is intentionally not specific
   enough to allow implementation from this document. The normative
   definition is in the 3GPP technical specification cited.


4.1. Video Buffering attributes

   The following attributes are used to provide parameters for the
   video buffer model provided in Annex G and Section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-
   234]. The attributes were defined in Release 5 as "X-" attributes
   and were at the time not considered for registration. In hindsight,
   however, they should not have been "X-" attributes, and they should
   have been registered, as the registration rules of SDP [RFC4566]
   point out. Changing their names today is impossible due to the
   deployed base of millions of mobile handsets supporting PSS, and
   therefore they are registered in their current form.

   All attributes are defined at media level.

   - The "a=X-predecbufsize" attribute provides the size of the pre-
     decoder buffer in bytes.
   - The "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" attribute provides the time during
     which a receiver should initially buffer, in 90kHz ticks, before
     starting to consume the data in the buffer in order to ensure
     that underflow does not occur, assuming correct data delivery.
   - The "a=X-initpostdecbufperiod" attribute provides the initial
     buffering period, in 90kHz ticks, for the post-decoder buffer
     present in H.263 and MPEG-4 Visual.
   - The "a=X-decbyterate" attribute indicates the maximum peak byte-
     decoding rate used in the verification of the Annex G buffer
     model expressed in bytes per second.
   - The "a=3gpp-videopostdecbufsize" attribute is used to indicate
     the value used in determining the H.264 video post-decoder buffer
     size.

   Note that complete descriptions of these attributes can be found in
   section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-234].


4.2. Video Frame Size attribute

   This media-level attribute provides the receiver with the largest
   picture size a specific H.263 payload type will carry within the
   session. The attribute has the following form (see 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-
   234]):

   "a=framesize:<payload type number> <width>-<height>"

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008




4.3. Integrity Protection Configuration Attributes

   These attributes are all used to configure the integrity-protection
   mechanism defined in Annex K (section K.2.2.1, K.2.2.2 and K.2.2.3)
   of [PSS-234].

   - The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-Integrity-Key" carries the
     integrity key used to derive SRTP master keys for integrity
     protection. They key is protected in different ways depending on
     a method identifier. When using OMA DRM keymanagement, the key is
     encrypted using AES [AES] before it is base64 encoded [RFC4648].
   - The media-level attribute "a=3GPP-SRTP-Config" is used to
     configure SRTP for integrity protection and contains an integrity
     nonce, a key salt used in deriving the SRTP master key from the
     integrity key, and any SRTP configuration parameters, such as the
     integrity tag length.
   - The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-SDP-Auth" is used to carry an
     authentication tag calculated over certain parts of the SDP to
     prevent manipulation of the security attributes.


4.4. The Alternative Attributes

   Two media and one session-level attributes are used in a mechanism
   for providing alternative SDP lines. One or more SDP lines at media
   level can be replaced, if desired, by alternatives. The mechanism is
   backwards compatible in the way that a receiver that does not
   support the attributes will get the default configuration. The
   different alternatives can be grouped using different attributes
   that can be specified hierarchically with a top and a lower level.
   3GPP Release 6 supports grouping based on bit-rate, according to the
   SDP bandwidth modifiers AS and TIAS, and language.

   The SDP attributes (see 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of [PSS-234]) are:
   - The media-level attribute "a=alt:<id>:<SDP-Line>" carries any SDP
     line and an alternative identifier.
   - The media-level attribute "a=alt-default-id:<id>" identifies the
     default configuration to be used in groupings.
   - The session-level attribute "a=alt-group" is used to group
     different recommended media alternatives. Providing aggregated
     properties for the whole group according to the grouping type.
     Language and bit-rate are two defined grouping types.


4.5. Adaptation Attribute

   The media-level SDP attribute "a=3GPP-Adaptation-Support" (see
   5.3.3.5 of [PSS-234]) is defined as part of the negotiation
   procedure of the PSS adaptation mechanism. The attribute carries a



M. Westerlund, P. Frojdh                                      [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008


   single value indicating how often the RTCP "Next Application Data
   Unit" (NADU) APP packet shall be included in sent RTCP compound
   packets. The adaptation mechanism allows the client to provide the
   server with information on the available transmission bit-rate and
   receiver buffer status.


4.6. Quality of Experience Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-QoE-Metrics" (see
   5.3.3.6 of [PSS-234]) is used to negotiate the usage of the quality
   of experience metrics. The included parameters indicate which
   metrics, over which duration there should be measurements, and how
   often reports should be sent.


4.7. Asset Information Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-Asset-Information"
   (see 5.3.3.7 of [PSS-234]) can exist in multiple instances in a
   description and describes different types of asset information. The
   different asset classes defined in Release 6 are: Title,
   Description, Copyright, Performer, Author, Genre, Rating,
   Classification, Keywords, Location, Album, and Recording Year. The
   different assets are described with a BASE64-encoded asset box from
   the 3GP file format [PSS-3GP].


5.  MBMS SDP Extensions

   The MBMS specification [MBMS] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes. They are informatively listed
   below.


5.1. MBMS Bearer Mode Declaration Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-mode" (see 7.3.2.7 of
   [MBMS]) is used to describe MBMS broadcast mode media. The attribute
   may be used at session level to set the default for all media and at
   media level to specify differences between media. However, the
   attribute is never used at session level when the session includes
   MBMS multicast mode media, nor at media level to describe MBMS
   multicast mode media.


5.2. FEC Flow ID Attribute

   The media-level attribute "a=mbms-flowid" (see 8.3.1.9 of [MBMS])
   maps one or more FEC source block flow IDs to their corresponding




M. Westerlund, P. Frojdh                                      [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008


   destination IP addresses and UDP port numbers. It is present in each
   SDP media block for repair packet streams.


5.3. MBMS Repair Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-repair" (see 8.3.1.8
   of [MBMS]) is used to provide FEC repair packets with non-FEC
   specific parameters. For Release 6 one such parameter is defined,
   specifying the required minimum receiver buffer time.


5.4. SDP Protocol Identifiers for FEC

   MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-based FEC for UDP-based
   traffic.  This solution uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
   identify the media streams that use the FEC shim layer. The media
   streams may be either source streams and repair streams. As required
   by SDP [RFC4566] these protocol identifiers are normatively defined
   in this document in accordance with their usage specified by 3GPP.

5.4.1. RTP Protocol Identifiers

   For FEC-protected RTP streams the following two "proto" identifiers
   are defined:

   - UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP
   - UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/SAVP

   They indicate the usage of UDP [RFC0768] with MBMS FEC Source packet
   formats, as defined in Section 8.2.2.4 of [MBMS], that transport RTP
   packets in accordance with the AVP [RFC3551] or SAVP (Secure RTP)
   [RFC3711] profiles, respectively.

   These protocol identifiers SHALL use the FMT space rules that are
   used for RTP/AVP and RTP/SAVP, respectively.


5.4.2. FEC Repair Data Identifier

   A media stream carrying MBMS FEC repair information over UDP
   requires its own "proto" identifier.  Protocol identifier "UDP/MBMS-
   REPAIR" identifies the FEC repair packet containing the protocol
   combination of UDP [RFC0768] and FEC repair payload ID and repair
   symbols as specified in Section 8.2.2.5 of [MBMS]. The FMT string is
   not used and SHALL be set to "*".


5.5. Video Buffering attribute





M. Westerlund, P. Frojdh                                      [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008


   The PSS media-level buffer attribute "a=X-initpredecbufperiod"(See
   Section 4.1) that specifies an initial buffering time is also used
   for MBMS in Release 7. It is mainly intended for video streams, but
   may be used for other media types as well (See Section 8.3.1.1 of
   [MBMS]).

6.  SDP Offer/Answer Consideration

  The usage of the SDP attributes in an Offer/Answer [RFC3264] context
  is not defined. These SDP attributes are defined for being used in a
  declarative context, and for PSS specifically in RTSP [RFC2326]
  context.


7.  PSS RTSP Extensions

   The RTSP extensions for PSS consist of a number of new RTSP headers
   and option tags and a narrowing of URI usage in regards to 3GP
   files. The headers and option tags are informatively described here;
   see [PSS-234] for the normative declaration.

7.1. 3GPP-Link-Char Header

   The "3GPP-Link-Char" header (see 5.3.2.1 of [PSS-234]) is used by
   clients to provide the server with QoS information about the
   wireless link it is currently using. The header can be used to
   provide the server with three different QoS parameters:
   - Guaranteed Bandwidth
   - Maximum Bandwidth
   - Maximum Transfer Delay

   The header may be included in RTSP requests using either of the
   methods SETUP, PLAY, OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER.


7.2. 3GPP-Adaptation Header

   The "3GPP-Adaptation" header (see 5.3.2.2 of [PSS-234]) is used by
   the client to provide the server with adaptation-related parameters
   and to indicate support of the adaptation function. The header
   carries the resource identification as a URI, the client's buffer
   size, and the desired target time.

   The header may be included in requests using the methods SETUP,
   PLAY, OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER. The response to a request using
   this method shall include this header.


7.3. 3GPP-QoE-Metrics Header





M. Westerlund, P. Frojdh                                      [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008


   The "3GPP-QoE-Metrics" header (see 5.3.2.3.1 of [PSS-234]) is used
   to negotiate the usage of the quality of experience (QoE) metrics
   (see Section 11 of [PSS-234]).

   The header may be included in requests and responses using the
   SETUP, SET_PARAMTER, OPTIONS or PLAY method.

7.4. 3GPP-QoE-Feedback Header

   The "3GPP-QoE-Feedback" header (see 5.3.2.3.2 of [PSS-234]) is used
   to carry QoE metrics from the client to the server when it reports,
   which happen either during or at the end of the media delivery.

   The header may be included in requests using the SET_PARAMETER,
   PAUSE, or TEARDOWN method.

7.5. Video buffer Headers

   PSS uses several headers to provide the client with the different
   buffer parameters. They provide the buffer status at the point of a
   stream that a PLAY request plays from. These headers may only be
   used in PLAY responses. See Section 5.3.2.4 and Annex G of [PSS-234]
   for normative definitions.

   The three "x-" headers were defined in 3GPP Release 5. When it was
   realized that they should not have been given "x-" names it was too
   late rename them due to deployment.

   The RTSP headers are:
   - x-predecbufsize
   - x-initpredecbufperiod
   - x-initpostdecbufperiod
   - 3gpp-videopostdecbufsize


7.6. Integrity Protection

   The integrity-protection mechanism defined in PSS Annex K uses the
   "3GPP-Freshness-Token" (See Section K.2.2.4 of [PSS-234]) RTSP
   header to carry a freshness token in DESCRIBE requests.

7.7. RTSP URI extension

   The PSS specification also defines syntax for referencing tracks
   within the "3GP" file format [PSS-3GP]. The 3GP format is based on
   the ISO base media file format and defined in several different
   profiles, including a streaming-server profile, in Release 6.

   This syntax is fully contained within the generic URI syntax defined
   for RTSP URIs. It is only a syntax restriction server manufacturers

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  July 7, 2008


   follow to allow clients or proxies to understand what encodes the
   track number in the URI. This is provided for information only.

   To identify a track within a 3GP file the last URI segment has to
   contain a structure that is <alpha string>=<track nr> (See 5.3.3.1
   of [PSS-234]).

7.8. Fast start-up and content switching

   Release 7 of PSS defines a number of extensions in terms of headers
   and option tags (See Section 5.5 of [PSS-234]) for support of fast
   start-up and switching of content for on-demand and live
   applications built on top of PSS. Clients are enabled to reuse the
   existing RTSP control session and RTP resources while switching to
   new content.

   The RTSP headers are:
   - Switch-Stream
   - SDP-Requested
   - Pipelined-Requests

   The RTSP option tags are:
   - 3gpp-pipelined
   - 3gpp-switch
   - 3gpp-switch-req-sdp
   - 3gpp-switch-stream

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1. SDP Registrations

   IANA is requested to register the SDP attributes listed below in the
   registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters. The
   contact person for this registration is Magnus Westerlund
   (magnus.westerlund@ericsson.com) Phone number +46 8 719 0000.

   SDP Protocol Identifiers ("proto"):

   Name:               UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP
   Long form:          3GPP MBMS FEC protected RTP/AVP over UDP
   Type of name:       proto
   Purpose:            3GPP MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-
                       based FEC for UDP-based traffic.  This solution
                       uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
                       identify the media streams that use the FEC
                       shim layer. This protocol identifier indicates
                       that the FEC protected data is RTP using the
                       AVP profile.

   Long form:          3GPP MBMS FEC protected RTP/SAVP over UDP
   Type of name:       proto
   Purpose:            3GPP MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-
                       based FEC for UDP-based traffic.  This solution
                       uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
                       identify the media streams that use the FEC
                       shim layer. This protocol identifier indicates
                       that the FEC protected data is RTP using the
                       Secure AVP profile (SAVP).

9.  Security Considerations

   SDP attributes are subject to modification by an attacker unless
   they are integrity protected and authenticated. The security
   consideration of the SDP specification [RFC4566] should be reviewed
   in this regard. The registered SDP attributes are vulnerable to
   modification attacks or removal, which may result in problems of
   serious nature, including failure to use service and reduced
   quality.

   The registered RTSP headers are also vunerable to insertion,
   deletion or modification attacks similar to SDP attributes. Also in
   this case it can result in failure of the service or reduced quality
   of streaming content.

   The three SDP protocol indentifiers do not by themselves introduce
   any additional security threats that don't exist for other protocol
   identifiers in SDP. The media stream and the protocols identified by
   the protocol identifier may however contain security issues by
   themselves.
