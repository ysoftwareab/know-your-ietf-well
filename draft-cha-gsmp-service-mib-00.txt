                    Abstract 
                        
                       General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface 
                       protocol between a label switch and a controller, and it provides 
                       connection, configuration, event, performance management and 
                       synchronization. Traditionally, network management services are 
                       classified into five categories: those are configuration, performance, 
                       fault, accounting, and security management. The companion draft 
                       document discussed the implementation complexity of a label switch 
                       and the efficiency of resource usage according to the location of 
                       network management functions. This document defines managed objects 
                       to support network management services in the GSMP interface.

                    1. Introduction 
                        
                       General switch management protocol (GSMP) provides an open interface 
                       that can be used to separate the data forwarder from the routing and 
                       other control plane protocols. GSMP protocol is asymmetric, the 
                       controller being the master and the switch being the slave. GSMP 
                       allows a controller to establish and release connections across the 
                       label switch; manage switch ports; request configuration information; 
                       request and delete reservation of switch resources; and request 
                       statistics. It also allows the label switch to inform the controller 
                       of asynchronous events such as a link going down. GSMP contains an 
                       adjacency protocol, which is used to synchronize states across the 
                       link [1]. 
                        
                       In the beginning, GSMP was intended only for use with ATM switches. 
                       GSMP has been extended to support multiple label types those are ATM, 
                       frame relay, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) generic labels. In 
                       the MPLS system, it is possible to run the routing protocols and 
                       label distribution protocols on a controller while passing data 
                       across a label switch. GSMP provides the switch resource management 
                       mechanism needed in such a scenario [2]. GSMP extensions have been 
                       progressing to support optical switching [3]. In several 
                       organizations, this GSMP protocol has been considering as an open 
                       interface [4]. The open interfaces of these organizations are Switch 
                       Control Interface of Multiservice Switching Forum, Connection Control 
                       and Management interface of IEEE PIN, and Connection Control 
                       Interface of ASON in ITU-T. 
                        
                       This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
                       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
                       The document of gsmp-mib[5] defines managed objects for the GSMP 
                       protocol. It is just a protocol MIB to configure, monitor and 
                       maintain the protocol entity. Traditionally, network management 
                       services are classified into five categories: those are configuration, 
                       performance, fault, accounting, and security management. The 
                       companion draft document discussed the implementation complexity of a 
                       label switch and the efficiency of resource usage according to the 
                       location of network management functions [6]. In particular, this 
                       document describes managed objects to support network management 
                       services in the GSMP interface.   
                        
                        
                    2. The SNMP Management Framework 
                        
                       The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
                       components:

                       *  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571]. 
                     
                       *  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
                          purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
                          Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described in 
                          STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212], and RFC 
                          1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in 
                          STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and RFC 
                          2580[RFC2580]. 
                     
                       *  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
                          first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and is 
                          described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the 
                          SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
                          protocol, is called SNMPv2c and is described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] 
                          and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol 
                          is called SNMPv3 and is described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 
                          [RFC2572], and RFC 2574 [RFC2574]. 
                     
                       *  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
                          first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats are 
                          described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of 
                          operations and associated PDU formats are described in 1905 
                          [RFC1905]. 
                         
                       *  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573], 
                          and the view-based access control mechanism is described in RFC 
                          2575 [RFC2575]. 
                     
                       A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
                       can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. 
                     
                       Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
                       the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
                       defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
                     
                       This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
                       MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
                       translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
                       equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
                       translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
                       information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in

                       This table represents the information of switch configuration. The 
                       entry of this table is mapped with each switch partition.  
                     
                     
                    3.2 gsmpInterfaceConfTable 
                        
                       The entry of this table represents the configuration information of a 
                       single switch port. 
                     
                     
                    3.3 gsmpServiceTable 
                        
                       This table represents the list of services and their associated 
                       parameters, which are supported by the switch.  
                     
                     
                    3.4 gsmpPortServiceMapTable 
                     
                       The entry of this table represents the service lists, which are 
                       supported by the specific port.  
                     
                     
                    3.5 gsmpTrafficParamTable 
                        
                       The gsmpTrafficParamTable contains objects, which specify the traffic 
                       parameters of in-segments and out-segments. Entries in this table are 
                       referred to from gsmpInSegmentTable and gsmpOutSegmentTable. 
                     
                     
                    3.6 gsmpInSegmentTable 
                        
                       This table contains a description of the incoming GSMP segments and 
                       their associated parameters. 
                        
                       The administrative and operational status objects for this table are 
                       used to control the packet transmission on this segment. If either

                       the administrative or operational status object is set to 'down', 
                       this implies that packets will not be forwarded. Likewise, if the 
                       value is set to 'up', this implies that packets are forwarded.  
                     
                     
                    3.7 gsmpOutSegmentTable 
                     
                       This table contains a description of the outgoing GSMP segments and 
                       their associated parameters. 
                        
                       The administrative and operational status objects for this table are 
                       used to control the packet transmission on this segment.  If either 
                       the administrative or operational status object is set to 'down', 
                       this implies that packets will not be forwarded.  Likewise, if the 
                       value is set to 'up', this implies that packets are forwarded. 
                     
                     
                    3.8 gsmpXCTable 
                        
                       A connection is modeled as a cross-connect consisting of one or more 
                       incoming segments (in-segments) and/or one or more outgoing segments 
                       (out-segments) at a switch [7]. The association or interconnection of 
                       the in-segments and out-segments is accomplished by using the 
                       gsmpXCTable. It supports point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and 
                       multipoint-to-point connections. 
                        
                       The administrative and operational status objects for this table are 
                       used to control the packet transmission on this XCEntry.  When the 
                       administrative and operational status objects are set to 'down', this 
                       implies that the specified entry will not forward packets. Likewise, 
                       if the value is set to 'up', this implies that packets will be 
                       forwarded. 
                     
                     
                    3.9 gsmpLabelStackTable 
                        
                       The gsmpLabelStackTable specifies the label stack to be pushed onto a 
                       packet, beneath the top label. Entries on this table are referred to 
                       from gsmpXCTable. This table is not supported in this version.

                       This table contains objects to measure the performance of GSMP 
                       interfaces and is an AUGMENT to gsmpInterfaceConfTable. High capacity

                       This table has objects to measure the performance of a connection. 
                       High capacity counters are provided for objects that are likely to

                    4. Example of Connection Setup 
                     
                       In this section, we provide a brief example of setting up a 
                       connection using the MIB objects described in section 5  While this 
                       example is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is 
                       intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  
                        
                       Suppose that one would like to manually create a bi-directional 
                       connection.  Assume that the connection enters the switch via 
                       interface A with ifIndex 11 and exits the switch via interface B with 
                       ifIndex 12. Let us assume that we do not wish to have a label stack 
                       beneath the top label on the outgoing labeled packets. The following 
                       example illustrates which rows and corresponding objects might be 
                       created to accomplish this. First, the traffic parameter entries must 
                       be set-up for both segments [7]. 
                        
                       In gsmpTrafficParamTable for the incoming direction : 
                       { 
                          gsmpTrafficParamIndex         = 1

                          gsmpTrafficParamRowStatus     = createAndGo(4) 
                       } 
                        
                       In gsmpTrafficParamTable for the outgoing direction : 
                       { 
                          gsmpTrafficParamIndex         = 2 
                          gsmpTrafficParamMaxRate       = 200000 
                          gsmpTrafficParamMeanRate      = 100000 
                          gsmpTrafficParamMaxBurstSize  = 2000

                       }

                       We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment 
                       entries with suitable traffic parameters by pointing to the 
                       appropriate traffic parameter entries that we have just created [7].

                       Next, a cross-connect entry is created thereby associating the newly 
                       created segments together. 
                        
                       In gsmpXCTable :

                       will automatically be populated with the value 1 when these segments
