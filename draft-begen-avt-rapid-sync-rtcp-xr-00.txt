Internet-Draft   Rapid Multicast Synch Report Block Type      March 2009


Abstract

   In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-
   related data.  Due to the dependency in the multicast data, randomly
   joining RTP receivers may not be able to start usefully consuming the
   data upon joining the multicast session, thus, they often experience
   a random synchronization delay.  In order to reduce this delay, an
   auxiliary unicast RTP session that facilitates rapid synchronization
   with the multicast session may be used between a retransmission
   server and RTP receivers.  Yet, due to various random components
   pertaining to the RTP data and networking infrastructure, the
   performance of rapid synchronization may vary.  For quality reporting
   and diagnostics, it is important to collect detailed information from
   the RTP receivers about their rapid synchronization experiences.
   This document addresses this issue by defining a new report block
   type, called Rapid Multicast Synchronization Report Block, within the
   framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR).  This
   document also defines the necessary signaling of the new report block
   type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).

Internet-Draft   Rapid Multicast Synch Report Block Type      March 2009


1.  Introduction

   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control protocol for
   the applications that are using the Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) for media transport [RFC3550].  In addition to providing
   minimal control functionality to RTP entities via sender and receiver
   reports, RTCP also enables a basic level monitoring of RTP sessions.
   More statistically detailed monitoring as well as application-
   specific monitoring is usually achieved through the RTCP Extended
   Reports (XR) [RFC3611].

   In most RTP-based multicast applications such as the ones carrying
   video content, the RTP source sends inter-related data.  That is, the
   RTP application may not be able to decode and present the data in an
   RTP packet before decoding one or more earlier RTP packets and/or
   before acquiring some certain information about the content itself.
   Thus, RTP receivers that are randomly joining the multicast session
   often experience a random synchronization delay.  In order to reduce
   this delay, [I-D.versteeg-avt-rapid-synchronization-for-rtp] proposes
   an approach where an auxiliary unicast RTP session is established
   between a retransmission server and the joining RTP receiver.  Over
   this unicast RTP session, the retransmission server provides all the
   information the RTP receiver needs to rapidly synchronize with the
   multicast session.  However, depending on the variability in the IGMP
   processing times [RFC3376], availability of network resources for
   rapid synchronization and nature of the RTP data itself, not all RTP
   receivers synchronize with the multicast session in the same amount
   of time.  The performance of rapid synchronization may vary not only
   for different RTP receivers but also over time.

   To increase the visibility of the service provider into its network,
   to diagnose slow multicast synchronization issues and to collect the
   synchronization experiences of the RTP receivers, this document
   defines a new report block type, which is called Rapid Multicast
   Synchronization Report Block, within the framework of RTCP XR.  RTP
   receivers that are benefiting from the rapid synchronization method
   described in [I-D.versteeg-avt-rapid-synchronization-for-rtp] may use
   this report every time they join a new multicast RTP session.

   Figure 1: Format for the Rapid Multicast Synchronization Report Block

      BT (8 bits):  Block type that identifies the block format.  Rapid
      Multicast Synchronization Report Block is identified by the
      constant TBD.

      rsvd. (4 bits):  This field is reserved for future definition.  In
      the absence of such definition, the bits in this field MUST be set
      to zero and MUST be ignored by the RTP receiver.

      Status (4 bits):  TBD.

      Block Length (16 bits):  The length of this report block,
      including the header, in 32-bit words minus one.  It MUST be set
      to 3.

      SSRC of the Multicast Session (32 bits):  The SSRC of the
      multicast RTP session that the RTP receiver has joined.

      RTP Extended Seqnum of the First Received Multicast Packet (32
      bits):  The RTP extended sequence number of the first packet
      received from the multicast session.

      IGMP Join Time (32 bits):  Greater of zero or the time difference
      (in ms) between the instant IGMP Join message has been sent and
      the instant the first RTP packet was received from the multicast
      session.

   The semantics of this report block is independent of the payload type
   of the multicast RTP session.

   Editor's note:  More fields can be defined in this XR report to give
   more details about rapid synchronization such as:

   o  Delta time between the rapid synchronization request and the
      arrival of the first unicast packet

   o  Delta time between the rapid synchronization request and the
      arrival of the first multicast packet

   o  Duplicate packet information (duplication due to receiving the
      same packet from both unicast and multicast session)

   Details are TBD.

4.  Session Description Protocol Signaling

   A new parameter is defined for the Rapid Multicast Synchronization
   Report Block to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566].  It has the following syntax within the 'rtcp-xr'
   attribute:

       rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=rtcp-xr:" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

            xr-format = "multicast-join"

            CRLF      = %d13.10

                                 Figure 2

   Refer to Section 5.1 of [RFC3611] for a detailed description and the
   full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3611] apply in this document as
   well.  Additional security considerations are TBD.

   If desired, similar to other RTCP XR reports, the rapid multicast
   synchronization reports MAY be protected by using SRTP and SRTCP
   [RFC3711].

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

   This document (provisionally) assigns the block type value TBD in the
   RTCP XR Block Type Registry to "Rapid Multicast Synchronization
   Report Block."  This document also registers the SDP [RFC4566]
   parameter 'multicast-join' for the 'rtcp-xr' attribute in the RTCP XR
   SDP Parameters Registry.
