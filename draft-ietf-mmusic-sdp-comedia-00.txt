Abstract 
 
   This document describes how to express media transport over 
   connection-oriented protocols using the Session Description Protocol 
   (SDP).  It defines three new protocol identifiers: TCP, TLS and 
   SCTP.  It also defines the syntax and semantics for an SDP 
   "direction" attribute that describes the connection setup procedure.

Introduction 
 
   The Session Description Protocol [SDP] provides a general-purpose 
   format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or 
   invitations. SDP uses an entirely textual data format (the US-ASCII 
   subset of [UTF-8]) to maximize portability among transports.  SDP 
   does not define a protocol, but only the syntax to describe a 
   multimedia session with sufficient information to discover and 
   participate in that session.  Session descriptions may be sent using 
   any number of existing application protocols for transport (e.g., 
   SAP, SIP, RTSP, email, HTTP, etc.). 
    
Motivation 
 
   [SDP] describes two protocol identifiers: RTP/AVP and UDP, both of 
   which are unreliable, connectionless protocols, an appropriate 
   choice for multimedia streams.  There are, however, applications for 
   which the connection-oriented transports such as TCP or SCTP is more 
   appropriate, but [SDP] provides no way to describe a session that 
   uses protocols other than RTP or UDP. 
    
   Connection-oriented protocols introduce a new factor when describing 
   a session: not only must it be possible to express that a protocol 
   will be based on this protocol, but it must also describe the 
   connection setup procedure. 
    
1  Protocol Identifiers 
    
1.1 TCP 
    
   The TCP protocol identifier is similar to the UDP protocol 
   identifier in that it only describes the transport protocol without 
   any connotation as to the upper-layer protocol.  An m= line that 
   specifies TCP must further qualify the protocol using a fmt 
   identifier (see [SDP] Appendix B). 
    
1.2 SCTP 
    
   The SCTP protocol identifier, like TCP above, only describes the 
   transport protocol without any connotation as to the upper-layer 
   protocol.  An m= line that specifies SCTP indicates that media will 
   be transports using the SCTP protocol [SCTP], with an upper-layer 
   protocol specified by the fmt identifier. 
    
1.3 TLS 
    
   The TLS protocol identifier specifies that the session will use the 
   Transport Layer Security protocol [TLS] with an implied transport 
   protocol of TCP.  To describe a media session that uses TLS over 
   TCP, the protocol identifier TLS must be specified in the m= line.   
   An m= line that specifies TLS must further qualify the protocol 
   using a fmt identifier.

2  Direction Attribute 
    
   An important attribute of connection-oriented protocols is the setup 
   procedure.  One endpoint needs to initiate the connection and the 
   other endpoint needs to accept the connection.  The direction 
   attribute is used to describe these roles, and the syntax is as 
   follows: 
    
          a=direction:<role> <source-port> 
    
   The <role> is one of the following: 
    
   passive:    The endpoint will accept an incoming connection. 
    
   active:     The endpoint will initiate an outgoing connection. 
    
   both:       The endpoint will both accept an incoming connection  
               and will initiate an outgoing connection. 
    
   The <source-port> is an optional value that may only be specified in 
   the context of direction:active or direction:both. 
    
2.1 Semantics of direction:passive 
    
   By specifying direction:passive, the endpoint indicates that the 
   port number specified in the m= line is available to accept a 
   connection from the other endpoint. 
 
2.2 Semantics of direction:active 
    
   By specifying direction:active, the endpoint indicates that it will 
   initiate a connection to the port number on the m= line of the other 
   endpoint.  The port number on its own m= line is irrelevant and is 
   to be ignored by the other endpoint.  Nevertheless, since the m= 
   line must contain a valid port number, the endpoint specifying 
   direction:active should specify a port number of 9 (the discard 
   port) on its m= line.  The endpoint must not specify a port number 
   of zero, as that carries other semantics in [SDP]. 
    
   The endpoint may optionally specify the port number from which it 
   will initiate the connection in the <source-port> position on the a= 
   line. 
    
2.3 Semantics of direction:both 
    
   By specifying direction:both, the endpoint indicates that it will 
   both accept a TCP connection on the port number of its own m= line, 
   and that it will also initiate a connection to the port number on 
   the m= line of the other endpoint.  As with direction:active, the 
   endpoint may optionally specify the port number from which it will 
   initiate the connection in the <source-port> position on the a= 
   line.

   Since this attribute describes behavior that is similar to 
   connectionless media descriptions in [SDP], it is the default value 
   for the direction attribute and is therefore optional. 
    
   Endpoints may choose to specify direction:both for one or more of 
   the following reasons: 
    
      1) The endpoint has no preference as to whether it accepts or 
         initiates the connection, and therefore is offering the remote 
         endpoint a choice of connection setup procedures. 

      2) The endpoints intend to use a single connection to transport 
         the media, but it is not known whether firewall issues will 
         prevent either endpoint from initiating or accepting the 
         connection.  Therefore both endpoints will attempt to initiate 
         a connection in hopes that at least one will succeed. 

      3) The endpoints intend to use two connections to transport the 
         media, and one must be initiated by the remote endpoint and 
         the other must be initiated by the local endpoint. 

   If one endpoint specifies either direction:active or 
   direction:passive and the other specifies direction:both, both 
   endpoints must behave as if the latter had specified the inverse 
   direction of the former.  For example, specifying direction:both 
   when the other endpoint specifies direction:active should cause both 
   endpoints to behave as if the former had specified 
   direction:passive.  Conversely, specifying direction:both when the 
   other endpoint specifies direction:passive should cause both 
   endpoints to behave as if the former had specified direction:active. 
    
   If both endpoints specify direction:both then each endpoint must 
   initiate a connection to the port number specified on the m= line of 
   the opposite endpoint.  If only one connection succeeds, then that 
   connection will be used to carry the media.  If both connections 
   succeed but only one was needed (case #2 above), the following rules 
   shall apply: 
    
      a) Each endpoint MUST accept data from either connection. 

      b) Once an endpoint has transmitted data to one of the 
         connections, it MUST use that connection exclusively for 
         transmission. 

      c) Once an endpoint has transmitted AND received data, if one of 
         the connections is determined to be idle, the endpoint MAY 
         close the idle connection. 

3  Source-Port Considerations 
    
   In the cases where the endpoint is initiating the connection, a 
   source port number may optionally be specified on the a= line by 
   that endpoint.  In most environments, the source port number can be

   determined by binding the socket before initiating the connect, as 
   shown in the sample C code below: 
    
   { 
    SOCKET s_id  
    SOCKADDR_IN cli_sin; 
    int namelen; 
    
       // Create the socket 
       s_id = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,IPPROTO_TCP); 
    
       // Bind the socket to any IP address and port 
       bzero((char *)&cli_sin,sizeof(cli_sin)); 
       cli_sin.sin_family      = AF_INET; 
       cli_sin.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY); 
       cli_sin.sin_port        = 0; 
       bind(s_id,(SOCKADDR *)&cli_sin,sizeof(cli_sin)); 
    
       // Find the port number that was bound 
       namelen = sizeof(cli_sin); 
       getsockname(s_id,(SOCKADDR *)&cli_sin,&namelen); 
    
       // Print the port number 
       printf("Source Port = %d\n",ntohs(cli_sin.sin_port)); 
   } 
    
   The motivation for specifying the source port is to allow topologies 
   where one or more endpoints use a single, fixed TCP port for 
   incoming connections.  Non-RTP protocols transported over TCP 
   commonly use this technique.  By specifying the source port, an 
   endpoint avoids a potential ambiguity when more than one session is 
   set up between two endpoints. 
    
   For example, consider two endpoints with IP addresses of 10.1.1.1 
   and 10.1.1.2.  The endpoint at 10.1.1.1 signals the availability of 
   a session on TCP port 2393 (passive).  Before the endpoint at 
   10.1.1.2 has a chance to initiate the connection, events transpire 
   that cause the endpoint at 10.1.1.1 to signal the availability of a 
   separate session that is also found at TCP port 2393 (passive).  
   Shortly thereafter, both entities at 10.1.1.2 initiate connections 
   to 10.1.1.1 on port 2393.   
    
   The problem is this: how does the endpoint at 10.1.1.1 differentiate 
   the two connections?  To which entity at 10.1.1.2 does each 
   connection correspond?  By specifying the source port prior to 
   connecting, the entities at 10.1.1.2 can avoid this ambiguity, 
   because now the endpoint at 10.1.1.1 can simply inspect the port 
   number from which the connection originated to determine which 
   entity has initiated the connection. 
    
   Caution must be exercised when designing systems that rely on this 
   feature, as not all environments are able to determine the source 
   port prior to initiating the connection.

4  Examples 
    
   What follows are a number of examples that show the most common 
   usage of the direction attribute combined with TCP-based media 
   descriptions.  For the purpose of brevity, the main portion of the 
   session description is omitted in the examples and is assumed to be 
   the following: 
    
        v=0 
        o=Me <me@ietf.org> 
        s=Call me using TCP 
        t=0 0 
    
4.1 Example: simple passive/active 
    
   An endpoint at 10.1.1.2 signals the availability of a T.38 fax 
   session at port 54111: 
    
        c=IN IP4 10.1.1.2/127 
        m=image 54111 TCP t38 
        a=direction:passive 
    
   An endpoint at 10.1.1.1 receiving this description responds with the 
   following: 
    
        c=IN IP4 10.1.1.1/127 
        m=image 9 TCP t38 
        a=direction:active 
    
   The endpoint at 10.1.1.1 then initiates the TCP connection to port 
   54111 at 10.1.1.2.  Note that the TCP connection may originate from 
   any port.  The endpoint at 10.1.1.1 could have optionally committed 
   to a source port with a simple modification: 
    
        c=IN IP4 10.1.1.1/127 
        m=image 9 TCP t38 
        a=direction:active 1892 
    
   By adding the "1892" to the a= line, the endpoint at 10.1.1.1 must 
   now use a source port of 1892 when initiating the TCP connection to 
   port 54111 at 10.1.1.2. 
    
4.2 Example: agnostic both 
    
   An endpoint at 10.1.1.2 signals the availability of a T.38 fax 
   session at TCP port 54111, but is also willing to set up the media 
   stream by initiating the TCP connection: 
    
        c=IN IP4 10.1.1.2/127 
        m=image 54111 TCP t38 
        a=direction:both 
    
   The endpoint at 10.1.1.1 has three choices:

      1) It can respond with either of the two direction:active 
         descriptions listed in the previous example.  In this case the 
         endpoint at 10.1.1.1 must initiate a connection to port 54111 
         at 10.1.1.2. 

      2) It can respond with a description similar to the following: 

               c=IN IP4 10.1.1.1/127 
               m=image 54321 TCP t38 
               a=direction:passive 
                
         In this case the endpoint at 10.1.1.2 must initiate a  
         connection to port 54321 at 10.1.1.1. 
         
      3) It can respond with a description that specifies 
         direction:both, which is covered in the next example. 

4.3 Example: redundant both 
    
   An endpoint at 10.1.1.2 uses the same description as the previous 
   example: 
    
        c=IN IP4 10.1.1.2/127 
        m=image 54111 TCP t38 
        a=direction:both 
    
   Unlike the previous example, the endpoint at 10.1.1.1 responds with 
   the following description: 
    
        c=IN IP4 10.1.1.1/127 
        m=image 54321 TCP t38 
        a=direction:both 
    
   This will cause the endpoint at 10.1.1.2 to initiate a connection to 
   port 54321 at 10.1.1.1, and the endpoint at 10.1.1.1 to initiate a 
   connection to port 54111 at 10.1.1.2.  Whichever TCP connection 
   succeeds will be used.  If both succeed, one of the connections may 
   be closed as an optimization, using the rules in section 2.3. 
    
5  Security Considerations 
    
   See [SDP] for security and other considerations specific to the 
   Session Description Protocol in general.  There are no new security 
   considerations introduced by these protocol identifiers and 
   attributes. 
    
6  IANA Considerations 
    
   As recommended by [SDP] Appendix B, the direction attribute 
   described in this document should be registered with IANA, as should 
   the TCP, TLS, and SCTP protocol identifiers.

Appendix A: Direction Attribute Syntax 
    
   This appendix provides an Augmented BNF [ABNF] grammar for 
   expressing the direction attribute for connection setup.  It is 
   intended as an extension to the grammar for the Session Description 
   Protocol, as defined in [SDP].  Specifically, it describes the 
   syntax for the new "connection-setup" attribute field, which MAY be 
   either a session-level or media-level attribute. 
    
   connection-setup =    "direction" ":" direction-spec 
    
   direction-spec =      "passive" | qualified-direction 
    
   qualified-direction = direction-ident | direction-ident port 
    
   direction-ident =     "both" | "active"
