1. Introduction 

   Wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) are based on Wavelength 
   Division Multiplexing (WDM) in which user traffic is carried by data 
   channels of different optical wavelengths. In traditional WDM 
   Networks, each wavelength path is statically configured. With the 
   deployment of Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs), 
   photonic cross-connects (PXCs), and tunable laser, WSONs have become 
   more dynamic, and operators can flexibly set up wavelength paths to 
   carry user traffic.  

   In WSONs where there are no or a limited number of switches capable 
   of wavelength conversion paths must be set up subject to the 
   "wavelength continuity" constraint. This leads to a path computation 
   problem known as routing and wavelength assignment (RWA). In order to 
   perform such computations, it is necessary to collect information 
   about the available wavelengths within the network. 

   [WSON-Frame] provides a framework for applying GMPLS [RFC3945] and 
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture [RFC4655] to the 
   control of WSONs to address the RWA problem. [WSON-Info] describes an 
   information model that specifies the information needed at various 
   points in a WSON in order to compute paths and establish Label 
   Switched Paths (LSPs). Based on the information model of [WSON-Info], 
   [WSON-Encode] provides efficient protocol-independent encodings of 
   the information needed by the RWA process in a WSON. Such encodings 
   can be used to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols.    

   Therefore, in order to enable GMPLS to control WSON networks, this 
   document follows on from [WSON-Info], [WSON-Encode], and [WSON-IGP-
   Eval] to define extensions to the OSPF routing protocol to enhance 
   the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS TE which are defined 
   in [RFC3630], [RFC4202], and [RFC4203]. 

   No consideration of optical impairment routing related information is 
   included in this document. 

2. Node Information 

   According to [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode], the node information 
   about WSON nodes includes Node ID, connectivity matrix, wavelength 
   converter pool information. Except for the Node ID which should 
   comply with Routing Address described in [RFC3630], the other pieces 
   of information are defined in this document. 

   [OSPF-Node] defines a new top TLV named the Node Attribute TLV which 
   carries attributes related to a router/node. Connectivity matrix,

   wavelength converter pool information are attributes associated with 
   a WSON node, so this document defines the following sub-TLVs of Node 
   Attribute TLV: 

   (1)Connectivity matrix sub-TLV 

   (2)Wavelength converter pool information sub-TLV 

2.1. Connectivity Matrix 

   Unlike the packet and TDM networks whose switching devices are 
   symmetric, the switching devices in a WSON are highly asymmetric. 
   Therefore, it is necessary to identify which ingress ports and 
   wavelengths can be connected to (the same wavelength on) a specific 
   egress port. Detailed descriptions of the Connectivity Matrix can be 
   found in the corresponding sections of [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode]. 

   The Connectivity Matrix TLV is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of 
   the Node Attribute TLV. The format of this sub-TLV is defined as 
   follows: 

    

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Connectivity : 8 bits 

       The following values are currently defined. All other values are 
   reserved and SHOULD be transmitted as zero and ignored on receipt.

       Indicates that the switching element is a kind of fixed switching 
   device, so the connectivity matrix represents the potential 
   connectivity matrix. This applies to asymmetric fixed devices or to 
   the fixed part of a "hybrid" device [Switch]. 

       0x02: Switched Connectivity Matrix 

       Indicates that the switching element is a kind of switched device 
   (e.g., ROADM or OXC). The connectivity matrix represents the 
   potential connectivity matrix for an asymmetric switch. 

   Reserved: 24 bits 

       This field is reserved. It SHOULD be set to zero on transmission 
   and MUST be ignored on receipt. 

   Link Set: At least one Link Set MUST be present. Multiple Link Sets 
   MAY be present. Each one has variable length. The Link set is defined 
   in Section 2.2.1.. 

2.1.1. Link Set   

       Link Set identifies a link group and is defined as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3

      :                               :                               : 
      :                               :                               :

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        

   The Link Set is not a kind of sub-TLV and it is just a part of the 
   Connectivity Matrix TLV. (Note that this construct may be reused in 
   the Wavelength Converter Pool information in Section 2.3 in a future 
   version of this document.) 

   Action: 8 bits 

       The following values are currently defined. All other values are 
   reserved.

       0x01: Inclusive List 

       Indicates that one or more link identifiers are included in the 
   Link Set. Each identifies a separate link that is part of the set. 

       0x02: Inclusive Range 

       Indicates that the Link Set defines a range of links.  It 
   contains two link identifiers. The first identifier indicates the 
   start of the range (inclusive). The second identifier indicates the 
   end of the range (inclusive). All links with numeric values between 
   the bounds are considered to be part of the set. A value of zero in 
   either position indicates that there is no bound on the corresponding 
   portion of the range. Note that the Action field could be set to 
   0x02(Inclusive Range) only when unnumbered link identifier is used. 

   Directionality of the Link Set (Dir): 2 bits 

       The following values are currently defined. All other values are 
   reserved.   

       0x01: Bidirectional 

       Indicates that the links in the Link Set are bidirectional. 

      0x02: Incoming 

       Indicates that the links in the Link Set are from the incoming 
   direction with respect to the node advertising the information. 

      0x03: Outgoing 

       Indicates that the links in the Link Set are to the outgoing 
   direction with respect to the node advertising the information. 

   Format: 6 bits 

   This field identifies the format of the link identifier. The 
   following values are currently defined. All other values are reserved. 

      0x01: Link Local Identifier with IPv4 address 

       Indicates that the links in the Link Set are identified by link 
   local identifiers which are IPv4 numbered. All link local identifiers 
   are supplied in the context of the advertising node. 

      0x02: Link Local Identifier with unnumbered interface

       Indicates that the links in the Link Set are identified by link 
   local identifiers which are unnumbered interface IDs. All link local 
   identifiers are supplied in the context of the advertising node. 

   Num Links: 8 bits 

   This field indicates the total number of the links in the Link Set. 

   Reserved: 8 bits  

       This field is reserved. It MUST be set to zero on transmission 
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.  

   Link Identifier: 32 bits for each link 

      If the Format field is set to 0x01 (Link Local Identifier with 
   IPv4 address), the link identifier is the interface IP address used 
   to identify the incoming or outgoing port corresponding to the link. 
   The format of the Link Identifier should comply with the format of 
   the Local/Remote Interface IP Address described in [RFC3630].  

       If the Format field is set to 0x02 (Link Local Identifier with 
   unnumbered interface), the link identifier is unnumbered. 

   An example about Connectivity Matrix representation could be referred 
   to the Section 3.2 of [WSON-Encode]. 

2.2. Wavelength Converter Pool Information 

     TBD. 

3. Link Information 

   The most common link sub-TLVs are already defined in [RFC3630], 
   [RFC4203]. For example, Link ID, Administrative Group, Interface 
   Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD), Link Protection Type, Shared 
   Risk Link Group Information (SRLG), and Traffic Engineering Metric.  

   For WSONs, per [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode], the following 
   additional link sub-TLVs are defined in this document. 

   (1) WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions sub-TLV 

   (2) Wavelength Availability sub-TLV 

   (3) Shared Backup Wavelengths sub-TLV

3.1. WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions 

   In WSONs, there may be wavelength restrictions on a link or port. For 
   example, a WSON link might only be able to support switching some 
   specific wavelengths. These restrictions are distributed by OSPF to 
   be convenient for wavelength path computation. 

   The WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions TLV is a sub-TLV (the type is 
   TBD by IANA) of the Link TLV. The format of this sub-TLV is defined 
   as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3

   RestrictionKind: 8 bits 

       The following values are currently defined. All other values are 
   reserved.   

       0x01: Simple wavelength selective restriction 

       In this case, MaxNumChannels indicates the maximum number of 
   wavelengths permitted on the port, and the accompanying Wavelength 
   Set indicates the specific permitted wavelengths. 

       0x02: Waveband device with a tunable center frequency and 
   passband. 

       In this case, MaxNumChannels indicates the maximum width of the 
   waveband in terms of the channels spacing given in the Wavelength Set. 
   The corresponding wavelength set is used to indicate the overall 
   tuning range. Specific center frequency tuning information can be 
   obtained from dynamic channel in use information. 

   MaxNumChannels indicates the maximum number of channels supported on 
   the port/waveband dependent on the setting of the RestrictionKind 
   field.

   Wavelength Set information is carried as defined in Section 3.4 of 
   [WSON-Encode]. 

3.2. Wavelength Availability Information 

   The requirements for a global semantic for wavelength labels and the 
   corresponding standardized wavelength label can be found in [Lambda-
   Labels]. 

   Because the wavelength continuity along the wavelength Label Switched 
   Path (LSP) should be ensured without wavelength conversion or with 
   wavelength conversion at some switches along the path, the 
   information about wavelength availability and wavelength connectivity 
   is very important when computing a wavelength LSP. For example, if 
   the wavelength label range [lambda 1, lambda 5] of fiber 1 can be 
   connected to the same wavelength label range of fiber 2, but only 
   lambda 3 is available on fiber 2 because other wavelength labels are 
   occupied, lambda 3 must be selected on fiber 1.  

   If the wavelength availability information is not known by the node    
   performing the path computation, then the computation can only be   
   performed at the level of TE links, and wavelength assignment must be   
   resolved locally by the switches on a hop-by-hop basis enhanced by   
   signaling protocol mechanisms used to negotiate label selection.   
   However, this case may be very inefficient in the signaling protocol,   
   and can easily lead to blocking problems where a path is selected for   
   which there is no suitable wavelength availability, unless some or   
   all of the switches along the path are capable of full wavelength   
   conversion. In the general case of limited or no wavelength   
   conversion, information on wavelength availability is essential to    
   perform efficient and accurate path computation.  

   It is possible to consider reporting the statuses of each wavelength 
   on a link using implicit wavelength identification based on the link-
   local knowledge of wavelengths supported and a well-known sequence. 
   However, this information would be of no use in a wider context (i.e., 
   away from the link ends). On the other hand, if the standardized 
   label format described in [Lambda-Labels] is used to identify every 
   wavelength when its status is reported, the wavelength information 
   will be a little larger (or the order of one wavelength label per 
   status advertised). This may have a significant affect on the total 
   information advertised in a network because a WSON link often 
   supports many wavelengths (e.g., 80 or 160 wavelength systems).  

   To minimize the size of information, a bitmap wavelength set is 
   defined in [WSON-Encode] to indicate the wavelength availability 
   information for a fiber, i.e., only one bit is used to indicate the 
 
 
Zhang                  Expires September 2009                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft        OSPF Extensions for WSON              March 2009 
    

   status of a certain wavelength (the wavelength is either available or 
   not available).   

   Note that there are five approaches for Wavelength Set which is used 
   to represent the wavelength availability information described in 
   Section 3.4 of [WSON-Encode]. Considering that the continuity of the 
   available or unavailable wavelength set can be scattered for the 
   dynamic wavelength availability, so it may burden the routing to 
   reorganize the wavelength set information when the Inclusive 
   (/Exclusive) List (/Range) approaches are used to represent 
   wavelength availability information. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED 
   that only the Bitmap Set be used for representation wavelength 
   availability information as follows. 

   The Wavelength Availability  TLV is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by 
   IANA) of the Link TLV. The format of this sub-TLV is defined as 
   follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |          Num Wavelengths      |         Reserved              | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |Grid |  C.S. |     Reserved    |    n  for lowest frequency    |

     :                                                               :

   Type = TBD 

   The three fields (Grid, C.S. and n) are defined in [Lambda-Label]. 

   Num Wavelengths: 8 bits 

       Indicates the number of the wavelengths represented by the bit 
   map.  

   Each bit in the bit map represents a particular frequency with a 
   value of 1/0 indicating whether the frequency is available or not. 
   Bit position zero represents the lowest frequency, while each 
   succeeding bit position represents the next frequency a channel 
   spacing (C.S.) above the previous. The values of the bit map are 
   defined as follows:

       1 = Available  

       0 = Assigned (in use, or failed, or administratively down, or 
   under testing)  

   The valid length of the bit map is clearly Num Wavelengths bits, but 
   the bit map should be padded to make the whole number of the bits in 
   bitmap be the time of 32 bits so that the TLV is a multiple of four 
   bytes. Padded bit SHOULD be set to 0 and MUST be ignored. 

   Bits that do not represent wavelengths (i.e., those in positions (Num 
   Wavelengths - 1) and beyond) SHOULD be set to zero and MUST be 
   ignored.  

3.3. Shared Backup Wavelengths 

   TBD. 

    

4. Procedures for Routing Flooding 

   The advertisement for the node attributes SHOULD comply with the 
   procedures described in [OSPF-Node]. 

   In the WSON networks, the node information can be classified as two 
   kinds: one is static information comparatively such as Node ID, 
   Connectivity Matrix information; the other is dynamic information 
   such as Wavelength Converter Pool Status information. For the static 
   node information, the router announces the static node information in 
   the node attribute TLV which could be advertised during the node 
   starts or periodically for some configurable time (e.g., per hour or 
   several hours). For the dynamic node information, the router 
   announces this information in the separate node attribute TLV which 
   SHOULD be advertised during node starts or when the corresponding 
   node information is changed. 

   For the WSON link information, the procedures for the routing 
   flooding SHOULD comply with [RFC3630], [RFC4203] and the other 
   existing family standards, and there is no extended process for the 
   link attributes advertisement, except that some link sub-TLVs are 
   defined in this document. 

   Note that as with other TE information, an implementation SHOULD take 
   measures to avoid rapid and frequent updates of routing information 
   that could cause the routing network to become swamped. A threshold 
   mechanism MAY be applied such that updates are only flooded when a

   number of changes have been made to the wavelength availability 
   information within a specific time. Such mechanisms MUST be 
   configurable if they are implemented. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other   
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   [RFC3630] says that the top level Types in a TE LSA and Types for 
   sub-TLVs for each top level Types must be assigned by Expert Review, 
   and must be registered with IANA. 

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the sub-TLVs as defined 
   in Sections 2.1, 3.1, and 3.2 as follows: 

6.1. Node Information 

   This document introduces the following sub-TLV of Node Attribute TLV 
   (Value TBD, see [OSPF-Node]) 

   Type   sub-TLV 

   TBD    Connectivity matrix 

6.2. Link Information 

   This document introduces the following sub-TLV of TE Link TLV (Value 
   2) 

   Type   sub-TLV 

   TBD    WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions 

   TBD    Wavelength Availability
