Abstract 

   There is a requirement to use MPLS to provide a network layer to 
   support packet transport services. It is desirable that the operation 
   and maintenance of such an MPLS based packet transport network follow 
   operational models typical in optical transport networks, while 
   providing additional OAM, survivability and other maintenance 
   functions not currently supported by MPLS. This draft presents a 
   framework for an architectural and functional profile of MPLS in 
   order to support packet transport services.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Motivation 

   Transport technologies (e.g. SDH, ATM, OTN) have been designed with 
   specific characteristics: 

   o  Strictly connection oriented 

      Long-lived connections 

      Manually provisioned connections 

   o  High level of protection and availability 

   o  Quality of service 

   o  Extended OAM capabilities 

   The development of MPLS-TP has been driven by carriers needing to 
   evolve SONET/SDH networks to support packet based services and 
   networks. 

   MPLS-TP defines a profile of MPLS targeted at transport applications. 
   This profile specifies the specific MPLS characteristics and 
   extensions required to meet transport requirements. 

1.2. Scope 

   This document specifies the high-level functionality of MPLS-TP 
   required for adding transport-oriented capabilities to MPLS. 

1.3. Terminology 

2. Summary of Requirements 

   This section summarizes the requirements for the MPLS transport 
   profile. Such requirements are specified in more detail in [21], .
   [22] and [23]. 

   Solutions MUST NOT modify the MPLS forwarding architecture, and MUST 
   be based on existing pseudowire and LSP constructs. Point to point 
   LSPs MAY be unidirectional or bi-directional. Bi-directional LSPs 
   MUST be congruent. Point to multipoint LSPs MUST be unidirectional. 

   There MUST NOT be any LSP merging.

   OAM, protection and forwarding of data packets MUST be able to 
   operate without IP forwarding support i.e. it MUST be possible to 
   forward packets solely based on switching the MPLS or PW label. It 
   must also be possible to establish and maintain LSPs and pseudowires 
   both in the absence or presence of a dynamic control plane. When 
   static provisioning is used, there MUST be no dependency on dynamic 
   routing or signaling. 

   LSP and pseudowire monitoring is only achieved through the use of OAM 
   and MUST NOT rely on control plane or routing functions to determine 
   the health of a path. Information from OAM functions is solely 
   responsible for initiating path recovery actions. 

   Mechanisms and capabilities must be able to interoperate with 
   existing MPLS and pseudowire control and forwarding planes. 

3. Transport Profile Overview 

3.1. Architecture 

   The architecture for a transport profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) is based 
   on the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW architectures defined in RFC 3031 [2], 
   RFC 3985 [5]  and [16]. 

   The MPLS-TP forwarding plane is a profile of the MPLS LSP and (MS-)PW 
   forwarding paradigm as detailed in section .3.4.  

   MPLS-TP supports a comprehensive set of OAM and protection-switching 
   capabilities for packet transport applications, similar to existing 
   SONET/SDH OAM and protection, as described in sections .3.5. and .
   3.7.  
   MPLS-TP is operated with centralized Network Management Systems with 
   or without the support of a distributed control plane as described in 
   sections .3.6. and .3.8.  

   MPLS-TP defines mechanisms to differentiate specific packets (e.g. 
   OAM, APS, MCC or SCC) from those carrying user data packets. These 
   mechanisms are described in sections .3.2. and .3.3.  

3.2. Generic-ACH Label (GAL) 

   MPLS-TP requires a mechanism to differentiate specific packets (e.g. 
   OAM) from others, such as normal user-plane ones. This special label 
   is referred to as the 'Generic-ACH Label (GAL)', as defined in [17]. 

   The 'Generic-ACH Label (GAL)' is a generic exception mechanism used 
   firstly to differentiate specific packets (e.g. OAM) from others,

Internet-Draft            MPLS TP Framework                   July 2008 
    

   such as normal user-plane ones, and secondly, to indicate that the 
   Generic Associated Channel Header (GE-ACH) appears immediately after 
   the bottom of the label stack. 

   Note that MPLS-TP OAM packets will not reside immediately after the 
   'Generic-ACH Label (GAL)' but behind the Generic Associated Channel 
   Header (GE-ACH). 

   In MPLS-TP, the 'Generic-ACH Label (GAL)' always appears at the 
   bottom of the label stack (i.e. S bit set to 1). 

3.3. Generic Associated Channel Header(GE-ACH) 

   The MPLS transport profile makes use of a generic associated channel 
   (GE-ACH) to support Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and 
   Security (FCAPS) functions by carrying packets related to OAM, APS, 
   SCC and MCC, over LSPs or PWs, carried in band. The GE-ACH is defined 
   in [18] and it is similar to the PWE3 Associated Channel, which is 
   used to carry OAM packets across pseudowires. The GE-ACH is indicated 
   by a generic associated channel header, similar to the PWE3 VCCV 
   control word, and this is present for all LSPs and PWs making use of 
   FCAPS functions supported by the GE-ACH. 

   The GE-ACH functionality for LSPs SHOULD be limited to only OAM, APS, 
   MCC and SCC channel data. 

   Figure 1 shows the reference model depicting how the control channel 
   is associated with the pseudowire protocol stack, as per RFC 5085 .
   [15].

   PW associated channel messages are encapsulated using the PWE3 
   encapsulation, so that they are handled and processed in the same 
   manner (or in some cases, an analogous manner) as the PW PDUs for 
   which they provide a control channel.

           Figure 2 : MPLS Protocol Stack Reference Model including the 
                          LSP Associated Control Channel 

   LSP associated channel messages are encapsulated using a generic 
   associated control channel header (GE-ACH). The presence of the GE-
   ACH is indicated by the inclusion of an additional 'Generic-ACH Label 
   (GAL)'. This arrangement means that both normal data packets and 
   packets carrying an ACH are carried over LSPs in a similar manner. 
   Note that where a traffic engineered LSP is used the paths will be 
   identical. 

3.4. Forwarding 

   MPLS-TP LSPs use the MPLS label switching operations defined in RFC 
   3031 [2]. The MPLS encapsulation format is as defined in RFC 3032 .
   [3]. Per-platform or the per-interface label space can be selected. 

   MPLS-TP (MS-)PWs support the PW forwarding operations defined in .
   [5]. Standard PW encapsulation mechanisms are applicable for 
   different client layers as defined by the IETF PWE3 WG. 

   MPLS-TP LSPs can be unidirectional or bidirectional point-to-point. 
   As for MPLS, point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP LSPs are unidirectional. 


 
 
<Lastname>             Expires January 7, 2009                 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft            MPLS TP Framework                   July 2008 
    

   The forward and backward directions of bidirectional MPLS-TP LSPs are 
   congruent: they follow the same path and the pairing relationship 
   between the forward and the backward directions is known in each node 
   traversed by bidirectional LSPs. 

   Equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing is not applicable to 
   MPLS-TP LSPs. MPLS-TP LSP merging is prohibited. 

   Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is disabled on MPLS-TP LSPs by default. 

   Both E-LSP and L-LSP are supported in MPLS-TP, as defined in RFC 3270 
   [4]. 

   The Class of Service (CoS) field (former MPLS EXP field) follows the 
   definition and processing rules of [19] and RFC 3270 [4], only the 
   pipe and short-pipe models are supported in MPLS-TP. 

3.5. Operations and Management (OAM) 

   MPLS-TP requires that a set of OAM capabilities is available to 
   perform fault management (e.g. fault detection and localization) and 
   performance monitoring (e.g. signal quality measurement) of the MPLS-
   TP network and the services. 

   The following OAM functions are intended to be supported by MPLS-TP 
   and are intended to be applicable to any layer defined within MPLS-
   TP, i.e. MPLS Section, LSP and PW: 

   o  Continuity Check 

   o  Connectivity verification 

   o  Performance monitoring 

   o  Alarm suppression 

   o  Remote Integrity 

   For all of the above listed functions, (except alarm suppression) 
   both "continuous" and "on-demand" operations are envisaged. 

   Performance monitoring includes means for both "packet loss 
   measurement" and "delay measurement". 

   A requirement has been expressed for MPLS-TP OAM packets share the 
   same fate as of data packets and that a means exists to identify OAM 
   packets. The documents [17] and [18] propose specific mechanisms

Internet-Draft            MPLS TP Framework                   July 2008 
    

   relying on the combination of the 'Generic-ACH Label (GAL)' and 
   Generic Associated Channel Header for MPLS Sections and LSPs and 
   using the Generic Associated Channel Header only for MPLS PWs. 

   MPLS-TP OAM toolset is able to operate without IP functionality and 
   without relying on control and/or management planes. In the case of  
   MPLS-TP deployment with IP functionality, all existing IP-MPLS OAM 
   functions, e.g. LSP-Ping, BFD and VCCV, can be used. 

   OAM mechanisms are able to detect link and node failures and 
   performance degradations and trigger recovery actions, according to 
   the requirements of the service. 

3.6. Control Plane 

   The MPLS Transport Profile utilizes a distributed control plane to 
   enable fast, dynamic and reliable service provisioning in multi-
   vendor and multi-domain environments using standardized protocols 
   that guarantee interoperability. The MPLS-TP control plane is based 
   on the MPLS control plane for pseudowires and the GMPLS control plane 
   for MPLS-TP LSPs, respectively. More specifically, LDP is used for PW 
   signaling and RSVP-TE for LSP signaling. The distributed MPLS-TP 
   control plane provides the following basic functions: 

   o  Signaling 

   o  Routing 

   o  Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation 

   In a multi-domain environment, the MPLS-TP control plane provides 
   different types of interfaces at domain boundaries or within the 
   domains such as UNI, I-NNI, and E-NNI where different policies are in 
   place that control what kind of information is exchanged across these 
   different types of interfaces. 

   The MPLS-TP control plane is capable to activate MPLS-TP OAM 
   functions as described in the OAM section of this document (.3.5. ) 
   e.g. for fault detection and localization in the event of a failure 
   in order to efficiently restore failed transport paths. 

   The MPLS-TP control plane supports all MPLS-TP data plane 
   connectivity patterns that are needed for establishing multiple types 
   of transport paths including protected paths as described in the 
   survivability section (.3.7. ) of this document. Examples of the 
   MPLS-TP data plane connectivity patterns are LSPs utilizing the fast

Internet-Draft            MPLS TP Framework                   July 2008 
    

   reroute backup methods as defined in [6] and ingress-to-egress 1+1 
   or 1:1 protected LSPs. 

   Moreover, the MPLS-TP control plane is capable of performing fast 
   restoration in the event of network failures. 

   The MPLS-TP control plane provides its own survivability features and 
   recovers from control plane failures and degradations using graceful 
   operations. The MPLS-TP control plane is largely decoupled from the 
   MPLS-TP data plane such that failures in the control plane do not 
   impact the control plane and vice versa. 

3.6.1. PW Control Plane 

   An MPLS-TP packet transport network provides many of its transport 
   services in the form of single-segment or multi-segment pseudowires 
   following the PWE3 architecture as defined in [5] and [16] . In 
   this context, the setup and maintenance of single-segment or multi-
   segment pseudowires is based on the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   as per [9]. 

   It shall be noted that multi-segment pseudowire signaling is still 
   work in progress. The control plane supporting multi-segment 
   pseudowires is based on [13]. 

3.6.2. LSP Control Plane 

   MPLS-TP provider edge nodes aggregate multiple pseudowires and carry 
   them across the MPLS-TP network through MPLS-TP tunnels (MPLS-TP 
   LSPs). The generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite already supports 
   packet-switched capable (PSC) technologies and is therefore used as 
   control plane for MPLS-TP transport paths (LSPs). The LSP control 
   plane includes: 

   o  RSVP-TE for signalling 

   o  OSPF-TE for routing 

   RSVP-TE signaling in support of GMPLS as defined in [11] is used for 
   the setup, modification, and release of MPLS-TP transport paths and 
   protection paths. It supports unidirectional, bi-directional and 
   multicast types of LSPs. The route of a transport path is typically 
   calculated in the ingress node of a domain and the RSVP explicit 
   route object (ERO) is utilized for the setup of the transport path 
   exactly following the given route.

   OSPF-TE routing in support of GMPLS as defined in [8] is used for 
   carrying link state information in a MPLS-TP network. 

   For routing scalability reasons, parallel physical links in an MPLS-
   TP network are typically bundled into TE-links as defined in [7] and 
   the OSPF-TE routing protocol disseminates link state information on a 
   TE-link basis. 

3.7. Survivability 

   A wide variety of resiliency schemes have been developed to meet the 
   various network and service survivability objectives. As part of the 
   MPLS/PW paradigms, MPLS FRR [6] provides two methods for local 
   repair using back-up LSP tunnels, while PWE redundancy [14] supports 
   scenarios where the protection for the PW can not be fully provided 
   by the PSN layer (i.e. where the backup PW terminates on a different 
   target PE node than the working PW). Additionally, GMPLS provides a 
   set of control plane driven well known protection and restoration 
   mechanisms [11]. Finally, as part of the transport networks and 
   applications paradigms, APS-based linear and ring protection 
   mechanisms are defined in [10] and [24]. 

   These schemes have different scopes. They are protecting against link 
   and/or node failures and can be applied end-to-end or on a segment of 
   the considered connection. 

   These protection schemes propose different levels of resiliency (e.g. 
   1+1, 1:1, shared). 

   The applicability of any given scheme to meet specific requirements 
   is outside the current scope of this document. 

   MPLS-TP resiliency mechanisms characteristics are listed below 

   o  Linear, ring and meshed protection schemes are supported. 

   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms (protection and restoration), rely on 
      OAM mechanisms to detect and localize network faults or service 
      degenerations. 

   o  APS-based protection mechanisms (linear and ring) rely on MPLS-TP 
      APS mechanisms to coordinate and trigger protection switching 
      actions. 

   o  MPLS-TP recovery schemes are designed to be applicable at various 
      levels (MPLS section, LSP and PW), providing segment and end-to-
      end recovery.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms support means for avoiding race 
      conditions in switching activity triggered by a fault condition 
      detected both at server layer and at MPLS-TP layer. 

   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms can be data plane, control plane or 
      management plane based. 

   o  MPLS-TP allows for revertive and non-revertive behavior 

   o  Multiple resiliency mechanisms can be applied to any connection. 

3.8. Network Management 

   The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP are 
   specified in [23]. It derives from the generic specifications 
   described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [12] for transport technologies. It 
   also leverages on the OAM requirements for MPLS Networks [20] and 
   MPLS-TP Networks [22] and expands on the requirements to cover the 
   modifications necessary for fault, configuration, performance, and 
   security. 

   The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP NE provides the 
   means through which a management system manages the NE. The 
   Management Communication Channel (MCC), realized by the GE-ACH, 
   provides a logical operations channel between NEs for transferring 
   Management information. For the management interface from a 
   management system to a MPLS-TP NE, there is no restriction on which 
   management protocol should be used. It is allowed to provision and 
   manage an end-to-end connection across a network where some segments 
   are create/managed, for examples by Netconf or SNMP and other 
   segments by XML or CORBA interfaces. It is allowed to run maintenance 
   operations on a connection which is independent of the provisioning 
   mechanism. An MPLS-TP NE is not required to offer more than one 
   standard management interface. 

   The Fault Management (FM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-TP NE 
   enable the supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction, 
   and alarm handling of abnormal operation of the MPLS-TP network and 
   its environment. Supervision for transmission (such as continuity, 
   connectivity, etc.), software processing, hardware, and environment 
   are essential for FM. Alarm handling includes alarm severity 
   assignment, alarm suppression/aggregation/correlation, alarm 
   reporting control, and alarm reporting.  

   Configuration Management (CM) provides functions to exercise control 
   over, identify, collect data from, and provide data to MPLS-TP NEs. 
   In addition to general configuration for hardware, software,

   protection switching, alarm reporting control, and date/time setting, 
   the EMF of the MPLS-TP NE also supports the configuration of 
   maintenance entity identifiers (such as MEP ID and MIP ID). The EMF 
   also supports configuration of the OAM parameters as part of 
   connectivity management to meet specific operational requirements, 
   such as whether one-time on-demand or periodically based on a 
   specified frequency. 

   The Performance Management (PM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-
   TP NE supports the evaluation and reporting upon the behaviour of the 
   equipment, NE, and network with the objective of providing coherent 
   and consistent interpretation of the network behaviour, in particular 
   for hybrid network which consists of multiple transport technologies. 
   Packet loss measurement and delay measurement are collected so that 
   they can be used to detect performance degradation. Performance 
   degradation is reported via fault management for corrective actions 
   (e.g. protection switch) and via performance monitoring for Service 
   Level Agreement (SLA) verification and billing. The performance data 
   collection mechanisms should be flexible to be configured to operate 
   on-demand or proactively.
