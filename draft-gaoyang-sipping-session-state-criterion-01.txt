Abstract

   There is debate on the topic of "Commit/Rollback of Offer/Answer on
   Unsuccessful re-INVITE".  The reason of the confusion is some
   application/session usages of offer/answer imply the nest
   transaction(mean transaction theory, not mean sip transaction)
   concept,but whitout unambiguous definition.  This paper reveal the
   concept of nest transactions in current RFC and other well known
   application/session usages.  And then clarify that there is no
   ambiguous state of session modification using current RFC definition.

Internet-Draft       The Criterion of Session State        February 2009


1.  Offer/Answer Usages In Current RFC

1.1.  In RFC3264

   The offer/answer exchange is atomic; if the answer is rejected, the
   session reverts to the state prior to the offer (which may be absence
   of a session).

1.2.  In RFC3312

   Session parameter negotiation using precondition may be combination
   of more than one offer/answer.Session parameter negotiation using
   precondition itself should be atomic.  From transaction(mean
   tranaction theory, not mean sip transaction) ponit of view, it forms
   nested transaction which use a offer/answer pair as a sub-
   transaction.

1.3.  In RFC3261

   If a UA receives a non-2xx final response to a re-INVITE, the session
   parameters MUST remain unchanged, as if no re-INVITE had been issued.
   And this is an intuitionistic(user point of view) requirement for
   rejecting session modification.

   We could conclude from there rules that there are nested transactions
   concept in application level above of offer/answer which use a offer/
   answer pair as a sub-transaction.  And the nested transactions has
   its own semantics of commit/rollback.  So, we should not just talk
   about commit/rollback of session state in offer/answer level when the
   application level has nested transactional semantics of commit/
   rollback.

   And it should be point out that if we just define the commit/rollback
   of session state in offer/answer level for all situation whitout
   considering the application level, we will restrict the application
   level usage of offer/answer in the future.  We should accept the idea
   that the application level usage of offer/answer should be open for
   the future extension.  For Example, in the future we define a complex
   application/session which need negotiation of session parameter using
   offer/answer in many times for one modification.

Internet-Draft       The Criterion of Session State        February 2009


2.  Current well known nested transactions in application level using
    Offer/Answer

2.1.  Precondition

   As RFC3312 defines, a user agent server that receives an offer with
   preconditions SHOULD NOT alert the user until all the mandatory
   preconditions are met;session establishment(/modification) is
   suspended until that moment.  So, any offer/answer pairs for
   reservation state notification is just part of the original session
   modification transaction(nested transaction).  As the precondition
   defined in RFC3312 is session level extention, the semantics of
   commit/rollback of session modification transaction(nested
   transaction) is in session level.  Other application level usage can
   using it as sub-transaction to form more complicated nested
   transaction.  There will be an example later in this text.

2.2.  Intuitionistic(user point of view) requirement for rejecting
      session modification

   There are some cases where it is useful to exchange offer(s)/
   answer(s) even before re-INVITE completes.  The case of adding a new
   media (like adding video to audio only session) which requires
   permission from the peer through some user interaction is one
   example.  Offer/answer pairs forms as sub-transaction of the final
   commit/rollback of modification.

   As RFC3311 defines: However, unlike a re-INVITE, the UPDATE MUST be
   responded to promptly, and therefore the user cannot generally be
   prompted to approve the session changes.  UPDATE did not have the
   nested transactional property in application level.

2.3.  3GPP usage of Offer/Answer to refine(reduce) codec set

   3GPP usage of offer/answer in PRACK/200OK or UPDATE/200OK pair to
   refine(reduce) the codec set, just as part of the modification of
   original session modification.

3.  The Criterion

3.1.  Criterion description

   Using nest transaction theory, when one application/session usages of
   offer/answer failure, it just rollback to the previous commited state
   in its semantics.  It maybe using other application/session usages of
   offer/answer as its sub-transaction, commited state in sub-
   transaction will be discarded.

3.2.  The level of application/session usages of offer/answer in nest
      transaction

   It is open(free) for any new application/session usages of offer/
   answer, but it should define the level of application/session usages
   of offer/answer in nest transaction for itself.  Here, this paper
   point out the level of application/session usages of offer/answer in
   nest transaction for current well konwn application/session using
   Offer/Answer.

   Considering the integrity, we define the root transaction as "Session
   Modification".2.1,2.2,2.3 stand for the application/session using
   Offer/Answer defined in 2.1,2.2,2.3.

   Level definition:

   "Session Modification" contains 2.2;

   2.2 contains 2.1 & 2.3;

   2.1 contains 2.3.

   When starting of the new "Session Modification" before the committing
   of the previous "Session Modification", UA should rollback to
   committed state of the top level of application/session using Offer/
   Answer.  Now, the top level application/session using Offer/Answer is
   2.2.

   The session state before F1 is state1; The session state after F2 is

   the point of F6, the previous commited state in semantics explained
   in 2.2 is state1(although the previous commited state in semantics
   explained in 2.1 is state2''), it should be rollback to state1.

                                 Figure 2

   F7 is the important one: if it is 200OK with answer, it means that
   UAS accept the new modification.  And in session level it is the new
   modification after the one trigged by Re-INVITE, so we have no reason
   to say that the the new successful modification should be commited by
   the signal(2XX of Re-INVITE) associate to the original modification
   request.And in signal level, Re-INVITE and UPDATE is independent
   transaction(SIP).As the new modification commitment and its state
   have nothing to do whit F8, the session state is clear.

   Considering the UAS has the local policy that new modification must

   notify the user, it must send 504 to reject F6.

   The confusing is because of some people hypotheses the relation of
   UPDATE and Re-INVITE.  As the new modification have been committed,
   the original session state without committing should be discarded(the
   previous state of the new modification must be the committed state).

4.3.  Racing condition of 200OK of Re-INVITE and UPDATE

4.3.1.  Problem

   As the new modification commited and its state have nothing to do
   whit F8, the problem of racing condition(200OK of Re-INVITE and
   UPDATE) described in 6.2 of "draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer" does
   not exist.

                                 Figure 3

   But considering the possible failure of F5, there is a new condition:
   F6 before F5, the the previous state of the new modification will be
   state after F6(Re-INVITE modification effected); F6 after F5, the the
   previous state of the new modification will be state before F1(Re-
   INVITE modification discarded).

4.3.2.  Solution in theory

   If UAS have doubt on the state of session, it may reject F5 using
   491/500+retry after.  When receving the ACK of F6(2xx INV), UAS can
   assure the sequence of ACK before UPDATE by CSeq(ACK for 2xx is end
   to end).  Then, the UAS can be sure the previous state of the new
   modification will be state after F6.

4.3.3.  Recommendation of signal flow

   The solution in 4.2 is theoretical, so we recommend another signal
   flow in practice.  And we think that any UA should avoid of getting
   signal flow into a racing condition.

   The Recommendation of signal flow is that when UAC want to send a new
   modification of session during a ongoing Re-INVITE transaction(SIP),
   it should using Re-INVITE after the final response of previous Re-
   INVITE.

   If Re-INVITE is in a pending state(such as ringing, F5), UAC may send
   Cancel request for termination of Re-INVITE(F6).  After F9, UAC send
   the new Re-INVITE request inclue the new modification(F11).
