Abstract

   This document defines requirements for IPv6 nodes.  It is expected
   that IPv6 will be deployed in a wide range of devices and situations.
   Specifying the requirements for IPv6 nodes allows IPv6 to function
   well and interoperate in a large number of situations and
   deployments.

1. Introduction

   The goal of this document is to define a minimal set of functionality
   required for an IPv6 node.  Many IPv6 nodes will implement optional
   or additional features, but all IPv6 nodes can be expected to
   implement the requirements listed in this document.

   The document is written to minimize protocol discussion in this
   document but instead make pointers to RFCs.  In case of any
   conflicting text, this document takes less precedence than the
   normative RFCs, unless additional clarifying text is included in this
   document.

   During the process of writing this document, any issue raised
   regarding the normative RFCs, the consensus is, whenever possible, to
   fix the RFCs and not to add text in this document. However, it may be
   useful to include this information in an appendix for informative
   purposes.

   Although the document points to different specifications, it should
   be noted that in most cases, the granularity of requirements are
   smaller than a single specification, as many specifications define
   multiple, independent pieces, some of which may not be mandatory.

   As it is not always possible for an implementer to know the exact
   usage of IPv6 in a node, an overriding requirement for IPv6 nodes is
   that they should adhere to John Postel's Robustness Principle:

      Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others. [RFC793].

1.1 Scope of this Document

   IPv6 covers many specifications.  It is intended that IPv6 will be
   deployed in many different situations and environments.  Therefore,
   it is important to develop the requirements for IPv6 nodes, in order
   to ensure interoperability.

   This document assumes that all IPv6 nodes meet the minimum
   requirements specified here.

1.2 Description of IPv6 Nodes

   From Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification [RFC-2460] we
   have the following definitions:

      Description of an IPv6 Node




Loughney (editor)                                               [Page 3]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


       - a device that implements IPv6

      Description of an IPv6 router

       - a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to
         itself.

      Description of an IPv6 Host

       - any node that is not a router.

2. Abbreviations Used in This Document

   ATM   Asynchronous Transfer Mode

   AH    Authentication Header

   DAD   Duplicate Address Detection

   ESP   Encapsulating Security Payload

   ICMP  Internet Control Message Protocol

   MIB   Management Information Base

   MTU   Maximum Transfer Unit

   NA    Neighbor Advertisement

   NBMA  Non-Broadcast Multiple Access

   ND    Neighbor Discovery

   NS    Neighbor Solicitation

   NUD   Neighbor Unreachability Detection

   PPP   Point-to-Point Protocol

   ULP   Upper Layer Protocol

3. Sub-IP Layer

   An IPv6 node must follow the RFC related to the link-layer that is
   sending packet.  By definition, these specifications are required
   based upon what layer-2 is used.  In general, it is reasonable to be
   a conformant IPv6 node and NOT support some legacy interfaces.




Loughney (editor)                                               [Page 4]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


   As IPv6 is run over new layer 2 technologies, it is expected that new
   specifications will be issued.  This section highlights some major
   layer 2 technologies and is not intended to be complete.

3.1 RFC2464 - Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks

   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks [RFC-2464] MUST
   be supported for nodes supporting Ethernet interfaces.

3.2 RFC2472 - IP version 6 over PPP

   IPv6 over PPP [RFC-2472] is MUST be supported for nodes that use PPP.

3.3 RFC2492 - IPv6 over ATM Networks

   IPv6 over ATM Networks [RFC2492] is MUSt be supported for nodes
   supporting ATM interfaces.  Additionally, the specification states:

      A minimally conforming IPv6/ATM driver SHALL support the PVC mode
      of operation. An IPv6/ATM driver that supports the full SVC mode
      SHALL also support PVC mode of operation.

4. IP Layer

4.1 General

4.1.1 RFC2460 - Internet Protocol Version 6

   The Internet Protocol Version 6 is specified in [RFC-2460]. This
   specification MUST be supported.

   Unrecognized options in Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination Options
   extensions MUST be processed as described in RFC 2460.

   The node MUST follow the packet transmission rules in RFC 2460.

   Nodes MUST always be able to receive fragment headers. However, if it
   does not implement path MTU discovery it may not need to send
   fragment headers.  However, nodes that do not implement transmission
   of fragment headers need to impose limitation to payload size of
   layer 4 protocols.

   The capability of being a final destination MUST be supported,
   whereas the capability of being an intermediate destination is MAY be
   supported(i.e. - host functionality vs. router functionality).

   RFC 2460 specifies extension headers and the processing for these
   headers.



Loughney (editor)                                               [Page 5]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


      A full implementation of IPv6 includes implementation of the
      following extension headers: Hop-by-Hop Options, Routing (Type 0),
      Fragment, Destination Options, Authentication and Encapsulating
      Security Payload. [RFC2460]

   An IPv6 node MUST be able to process these headers.  It should be
   noted that there is some discussion about the use of Routing Headers
   and possible security threats [IPv6-RH] caused by them.

4.2 Neighbor Discovery

4.2.1 RFC2461 - Neighbor Discovery for IPv6

   Neighbor Discovery is SHOULD be supported.  RFC 2461 states:

      "Unless specified otherwise (in a document that covers operating
      IP over a particular link type) this document applies to all link
      types. However, because ND uses link-layer multicast for some of
      its services, it is possible that on some link types (e.g., NBMA
      links) alternative protocols or mechanisms to implement those
      services will be specified (in the appropriate document covering
      the operation of IP over a particular link type).  The services
      described in this document that are not directly dependent on
      multicast, such as Redirects, Next-hop determination, Neighbor
      Unreachability Detection, etc., are expected to be provided as
      specified in this document.  The details of how one uses ND on
      NBMA links is an area for further study."

   Some detailed analysis of Neighbor discovery follows:

   Router Discovery is how hosts locate routers that reside on an
   attached link. Router Discovery is MUST be supported for
   implementations. However, an implementation MAY support disabling
   this function.

   Prefix Discovery is how hosts discover the set of address prefixes
   that define which destinations are on-link for an attached link.
   Prefix discovery is MUST be supported for implementations. However,
   the implementation MAY support the option of disabling this function.

   Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) MUST be supported for all
   paths between hosts and neighboring nodes. It is not required for
   paths between routers.  It is required for multicast. However, when a
   node receives a unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message (that may
   be a NUD's NS), the node MUST respond to it (i.e. send a unicast
   Neighbor Advertisement).

   Duplicate Address Detection is MUST be supported (RFC2462 section 5.4



Loughney (editor)                                               [Page 6]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


   specifies DAD MUST take place on all unicast addresses).

   Sending Router Solicitation MUST be supported for host
   implementation, but MAY support a configuration option to disable
   this functionality.

   Receiving and processing Router Advertisements MUST be supported for
   host implementation s. However, the implementation MAY support the
   option of disabling this function. The ability to understand specific
   Router Advertisements is dependent on supporting the specification
   where the RA is specified.

   Sending and Receiving Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) MUST be supported. NS and NA messages are required
   for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).

   Redirect Function SHOULD be supported. If the node is a router,
   Redirect Function MUST be supported.

4.3 Path MTU Discovery & Packet Size

4.3.1 RFC1981 - Path MTU Discovery

   Path MTU Discovery [RFC-1981] MAY be supported.  Nodes with a link
   MTU larger than the minimum IPv6 link MTU (1280 octets) can use Path
   MTU Discovery in order to discover the real path MTU. The relative
   overhead of IPv6 headers is minimized through the use of longer
   packets, thus making better use of the available bandwidth.

   The IPv6 specification [RFC-2460] states in chapter 5 that "a minimal
   IPv6 implementation (e.g., in a boot ROM) may simply restrict itself
   to sending packets no larger than 1280 octets, and omit
   implementation of Path MTU Discovery."

   If Path MTU Discovery is not implemented then the sending packet size
   is limited to 1280 octets (standard limit in [RFC-2460]). However, if
   this is done, the host MUST be able to receive packets with size up
   to the link MTU before reassembly. This is because the node at the
   other side of the link has no way of knowing less than the MTU is
   accepted.

4.3.2 RFC2675 - IPv6 Jumbograms

   IPv6 Jumbograms [RFC2675] MAY be supported.

4.4  RFC2463 - ICMP for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)

   ICMPv6 [RFC-2463] MUST be supported.



Loughney (editor)                                               [Page 7]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


4.5 Addressing

   Currently, there is discussion on-going on support for site-local
   addressing.

4.5.1 RFC2373 - IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture

   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC-2373] MUST be supported.
   Currently, this specification is being updated by [ADDRARCHv3].

4.5.2 RFC2462 - IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is defined in [RFC-2462].
   This specification MUST be supported for nodes that are hosts.

   Nodes that are routers MUST be able to generate link local addresses
   as described in this specification.

   From 2462:

      The autoconfiguration process specified in this document applies
      only to hosts and not routers. Since host autoconfiguration uses
      information advertised by routers, routers will need to be
      configured by some other means. However, it is expected that
      routers will generate link-local addresses using the mechanism
      described in this document. In addition, routers are expected to
      successfully pass the Duplicate Address Detection procedure
      described in this document on all addresses prior to assigning
      them to an interface.

   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) MUST be supported.

4.5.3 RFC3041 - Privacy Extensions for Address Configuration in IPv6

   Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC-3041]
   MAY be supported.  Currently, there is discussion of the
   applicability of temporary addresses.

4.5.4 Default Address Selection for IPv6

   Default Address Selection for IPv6 [DEFADDR] SHOULD be supported, if
   a node has more than one IPv6 address per interface or a node has
   more that one IPv6 interface (physical or logical) configured.

   The rules specified in the document are the only MUST to implement
   portion of the architecture.  A node MUST belong to one site. There
   is no requirement that a node be able to belong to more than one.




Loughney (editor)                                               [Page 8]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


   This draft has been approved as a proposed standard.

4.5.5 Stateful Address Autoconfiguration

   Stateful Address Autoconfiguration MAY be supported.  For those IPv6
   Nodes that implement a stateful configuration mechanism such as
   [DHCPv6], those nodes MUST initiate stateful address
   autoconfiguration upon the receipt of a Router Advertisement with the
   Managed address flag set.  In addition, as defined in [RFC2462], in
   the absence of a router, hosts that implement a stateful
   configuration mechanism such as [DHCPv6] MUST attempt to use stateful
   address autoconfiguration.

   For IPv6 Nodes that do not implement the optional stateful
   configuration mechanisms such as [DHCPv6], the Managed Address flag
   of a Router Advertisement can be ignored.  Furthermore, in the
   absence of a router, this type of node is not required to initiate
   stateful address autoconfiguration as specified in  [RFC2462].

4.6 Other

4.6.1 RFC2473 - Generic Packet Tunneling in IPv6 Specification

   Generic Packet Tunneling [RFC-2473] MUST be suppored for nodes
   implementing mobile node functionality or Home Agent functionality of
   Mobile IP [MIPv6].

4.6.2 RFC2710 - Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6

   Multicast Listener Discovery [RFC-2710] MUST be supported by nodes
   supporting multicast applications. A primary IPv6 multicast
   application is Neighbor Discovery (all those solicited-node mcast
   addresses must be joined).

   When MLDv2 [MLDv2] has been completed, it SHOULD take precedence over
   MLD.

5. Transport Layer and DNS

5.1 Transport Layer

5.1.1 RFC2147 - TCP and UDP over IPv6 Jumbograms

   This specification is MUST be supported if jumbograms are implemented
   [RFC-2675].  One open issue is if this document needs to be updated,
   as it refers to an obsoleted document.

5.2 DNS



Loughney (editor)                                               [Page 9]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


   DNS, as described in [RFC-1034], [RFC-1035] and [RFC-1886] MAY be
   supported.  Not all nodes will need to resolve addresses.

5.2.1 RFC2874 - DNS Extensions to Support IPv6 Address Aggregation and
      Renumbering

   DNS Extensions to Support IPv6 Address Aggregation and Renumbering
   MAY be supported.

5.2.2 RFC2732 - Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's

   RFC 2732 is MUST be supported if applications on the node use URL's.

5.3 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [DHCPv6] is MAY be
   supported.

6. IPv4 Support and Transition

   IPv6 nodes MAY support IPv4. However, this document should consider
   the following cases: native IPv6 only; native IPv6 with IPv4
   supported only via tunneling over IPv6; and native IPv6 and native
   IPv4 both fully supported.

6.1 Transition Mechanisms

   IPv6 nodes SHOULD use native address instead of transition-based
   addressing.

6.1.1 RFC2893 - Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers

   If an IPv6 node implement dual stack and/or tunneling, then RFC2893
   MUST be supported.

   This document is currently being updated.

7. Mobility

   Currently, the MIPv6 specification [MIPv6] is nearing completion.
   Mobile IPv6 places some requirements on IPv6 nodes.  This document is
   not meant to prescribe behaviors, but to capture the consensus of
   what should be done for IPv6 nodes with respect to Mobile IPv6.

   Mobile Node functionality MAY be supported.

   Route Optimization functionality SHOULD be supported for hosts.
   Route Optimization is not required for routers.



Loughney (editor)                                              [Page 10]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


   Home Agent functionality is MAY be supported.

8. Security

   This section describes the specification of IPsec for the IPv6 node.
   Other issues that IPsec cannot resolve are described in the security
   considerations.

8.1 Basic Architecture

   Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC-2401] MUST be
   supported.  IPsec transport mode MUST be supported. IPsec tunnel mode
   MUST be supoorted.

   Applying single security association of ESP [RFC-2406] to a packet is
   MUST, although RFC-2401 defines four types of combination of security
   associations that must be supported by compliant IPsec hosts.

   Applying single security association of AH is MUST be supported, if
   AH [RFC-2402] is implemented.

   The following packet type MUST be supported if AH is combined with
   ESP: IP|AH|ESP|ULP.

   The summary of Basic Combinations of Security Associations in section
   4.5 of RFC-2401 is:

   case 1-2 MUST be supported.
   case 1-1 and 1-3 MUST be supported if AH is implemented.
   case 1-4, 1-5, 2-5 and 4 MUST be supported if IPsec tunnel mode is
        implemented.
   case 2-4 is MUST be supported if IPsec tunnel mode and AH is
        implemented.
   case 3 is not applicable to this document.

8.2 Security Protocols

   ESP [RFC-2406] MUST be supported.

   AH [RFC-2402] MUST be supported.  AH is needed if there is data in IP
   header to be protected, for example, an extension header.

   However, in practice, ESP can provide the same security services as
   AH as well as confidentiality, thus there is no real need for AH.

8.3 Transforms and Algorithms

   The ESP DES-CBC Cipher Algorithm With Explicit IV [RFC-2405] is MUST



Loughney (editor)                                              [Page 11]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


   be supported if interoperability is required with old implementations
   supported DES-CBC.  Note, however, the IPsec WG recommends not using
   this algorithm. 3DES-CBC is SHOULD be supported, so that ESP CBC-Mode
   Cipher Algorithms [RFC-2451] MUST be supported.  Note that the IPsec
   WG also recommends not using this algorithm.

   AES-128-CBC [ipsec-ciph-aes-cbc] is MUST be supported. NULL
   Encryption algorithm [RFC-2410] MUST be supported for providing
   integrity service and also for debugging use.

   The use of HMAC-SHA-1-96 within ESP, described in [RFC-2404] MUST be
   supported.  This MUST be used if AH is implemented. The Use of HMAC-
   MD5-96 within ESP, described in [RFC-2403] MUST be supported.  This
   MUST be used if AH is implemented. The "HMAC-SHA-256-96 Algorithm and
   Its Use With IPsec" [ipsec-ciph-sha-256] MUST be supported, but it is
   being discussed in the IPsec WG. An implementer MUST refer to Keyed-
   Hashing for Message Authentication [RFC-2104].

8.4 Key Management Methods

   Manual keying MUST be supported

   Automated SA and Key Management SHOULD be supported for the use of
   the anti-replay features of AH and ESP, and to accommodate on-demand
   creation of SAs, session-oriented keying.

   IKE [RFC-2407, RFC-2408, RFC-2409] MAY be supported for unicast
   traffic.  Note that the IPsec WG is working on the successor to IKE
   [SOI].

9. Router Functionality

   This section defines general considerations for IPv6 nodes that act
   as routers.  It is for future study if this document, or a separate
   document is needed to fully define IPv6 router requirements.
   Currently, this section does not discuss routing protocols.

9.1 General

9.1.1 RFC2711 - IPv6 Router Alert Option

   The Router Alert Option [RFC-2711] is MUST be supported by nodes that
   perform packet forwarding at the IP layer (i.e. - the node is a
   router).

9.1.2 RFC2461 - Neighbor Discovery for IPv6

   Sending Router Advertisements and processing Router Solicitation MUST



Loughney (editor)                                              [Page 12]





Internet-Draft                                          October 31, 2002


   be supported.

10. Network Management

   Network Management, MAY be supported by IPv6 nodes.  However, for
   IPv6 nodes that are embedded devices, network management may be the
   only possibility to control these hosts.

10.1 MIBs

   In a general sense, MIBs are required by the nodes that support a
   SNMP agent.  It should be also noted that these specifications are
   being updated.

10.1.1 RFC2452 - IPv6 Management Information Base for the Transmission
       Control Protocol

11. Security Considerations

   This draft does not affect the security of the Internet, but
   implementations of IPv6 are expected to support a minimum set of
   security features to ensure security on the Internet.  "IP Security
   Document Roadmap" [RFC-2411] is important for everyone to read.

   The security considerations in RFC2401 describes,

      The security features of IPv6 are described in the Security
      Architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC-2401].

   IPsec cannot cover all of security requirement for IPv6 node. For
   example, IPsec cannot protect the node from some kinds of DoS attack.
   The node may need a mechanism of IPv6 packet filtering functionality,
   and also may need a mechanism of rate limitation.

   The use of ICMPv6 without IPsec can expose the nodes in question to
   various kind of attacks including Denial-of-Service, Impersonation,
   Man-in-the-Middle, and others.  Note that only manually keyed IPsec
   can protect some of the ICMPv6 messages that are related to
   establishing communications. This is due to chick en-and-egg problems
   on running automated key management protocols on top of IP. However,
   manually keyed IPsec may require a large number of SAs in order to
   run on a large network due to the use of many addresses during ICMPv6
   Neighbor Discovery.

   An implementer should also consider the analysis of anycast
   [ANYCAST].
