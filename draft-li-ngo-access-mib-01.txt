Internet-Draft        Accessing MIBs using NETCONF             June 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a simple mechanism for accessing the Management
   Information Base (MIB), using the existing NETCONF RPC
   infrastructure.  It defines a set of specific operations for
   accessing the MIB as a capability of NETCONF.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.1.  Motivation

   NETCONF [RFC4741] conceptually partitions its design into four
   layers:

             Layer                      Example
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
        |   Content   |      |     Configuration data      |
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
               |                           |
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
        | Operations  |      | <get-config>, <edit-config> |
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
               |                           |
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
        |     RPC     |      |    <rpc>, <rpc-reply>       |
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
               |                           |
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
        |  Transport  |      |   BEEP, SSH, SSL, console   |
        |   Protocol  |      |                             |
        +-------------+      +-----------------------------+


   Transport Protocol, RPC and Operations layers have already been
   standardized to a degree, while the Content Layer has not been
   standardized yet.  Device vendors have been asked to support NETCONF
   in their products, but there is no standard data definition language
   or standard content for NETCONF at this time.

   SMIv2 [RFC2578] is the IETF-standard for network management data
   modeling, and the MIB is the IETF standard for organizing MIB
   modules.  There are many standard MIB modules, and these have been
   supplemented by many proprietary MIB modules defined by device
   vendors.  Many devices already support a wide range of MIB modules,
   and many network management applications already utilize the
   information modeled in the available MIB modules.

   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP), but RFC1052 [RFC1052] documents the IAB
   decision to use the MIB as the IETF standard for data modeling, and
   the intention of the IETF to permit the MIB to be utilized by
   multiple protocols.

   The netconf community wants to develop a data modeling language with
   structures more complex than SMIv2 permits, and to have the netconf
   protocol support task-oriented RPCs to perform operations, rather
   than a data-oriented protocol, such as SNMP, that has a small number
   of verbs that are designed to directly manipulate data elements.

   While the netconf community works on developing its data modeling
   language and data models, the netconf community has recommended that
   vendors simply use their own proprietary data models, written in an
   XML format.  This approach is a problem for device vendors.  They do
   not know what configuration data they should provide; if they use
   proprietary data, the customer desire for interoperability between
   devices and applications from different vendors cannot be met.  If
   the IETF standardizes an XML-based data model in the near future,
   then there will be little return on the investment for developing a
   proprietary XML-based data model.

   The MIB is a standard data model that most internetworking device
   vendors already support to provide interoperable management for their
   products.  Vendors could use the MIB, expressed in XML, as one type
   of data model for NETCONF.  The libsmi tools already have an option
   to convert MIB modules into corresponding XML Schemas, so this will
   make it easier to use MIB data with netconf.

   This memo proposes a set of RPCs, packaged as a capability, for
   NETCONF to access MIB objects.

2.  XML schemas for MIB definitions

   MIB modules are written using an adapted subset of Abstract Syntax
   Notation One, ASN.1 [refs.asn1] (1988), which is called the Structure
   of Management Information (SMI).  NETCONF encodes configuration data
   in XML [refs.xml], and the data model of NETCONF should be described
   using XML DTD or XML schema [refs.schema] or other XML schema
   language.  At the time of this writing, XML schema is preferred.
   Those MIB modules to be used with NETCONF should be rewritten in XSD,
   and for interoperability the resulting XML schema written by
   different people should have the same format.

   The libsmi toolkit contains an smidump tool, which can transform a
   MIB module into various formats, including an XML schema.  The libsmi
   toolkit has been available for many years, and a number of

   applications already use the smidump XML schemas.  For the sake of
   compatibility, this memo also uses XML schemas generated by smidump.
   The "Using Smidump to Convert MIB to XSD" [refs.mib-convert] expounds
   how the smidump converts a MIB to an XSD.

3.  How This Capability Fits with the SNMP Architecture

   RFC3411 provides an architecture for describing SNMP frameworks.
   There are similarities between the netconf architecture and the
   RFC3411 architecture.

   The Netconf Protocol describes the message format for netconf, which
   is similar to a model in the message processing subsystem described

Internet-Draft        Accessing MIBs using NETCONF             June 2007


   in RFC3412 [RFC3412].  The transport/application mappings of netconf
   are similar to transport models in the Transport Subsystem for SNMP,
   as described in [I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm].

   Having the ability to access the MIB data is similar to an SNMP
   application, as described in RFC3413 [RFC3413].  However, an
   "application" in the SNMP architecture requires input parameters, for
   data addressing, and for access control purposes.

3.1.  Data Addressing

   Within SNMPv3, an individual item of information within an
   administrative domain is addressed by a four-tuple consisting of a
   contextEngineID, a contextName, an object type, and an object
   instance.  The last two elements are typically encoded in an object
   identifier (OID) value.  As of this writing, Netconf does not provide
   the equivalent of this four-tuple.  This memo uses an XML-based
   address that encodes the object type and object instance, derived
   from the equivalent Object Identifier.

   An SNMP version 3 message [RFC3412] carries a scopedPDU - a data
   structure containing a contextEngineID, a contextName, and a protocol
   data unit (PDU) which contains MIB data.  The smidump schemas always
   have a <context> element that includes mandatory attributes to
   identify the SNMP context of the MIB data.

3.2.  Access Control

   Within SNMPv3, an access control model determines who is allowed to
   perform which operations to different data sets of information.  The
   RFC3411 architecture describes a series of parameters that are
   provided to the isAccessAllowed() service primitive to make this
   determination.  The parameters include a securityModel and
   securityName to identify the (possibly-authenticated) principal

   statusInformation =              -- success or errorIndication
       isAccessAllowed(
       IN   securityModel             -- Security Model in use
       IN   securityName              -- principal who wants to access
       IN   securityLevel             -- Level of Security
       IN   viewType                  -- read, write, or notify view
       IN   contextName               -- context containing variableName
       IN   variableName              -- OID for the managed object
            )


   A securityModel is the model within the SNMP security subsystem that
   will provide authentication, integrity checking, encryption, and



Li & Harrington         Expires December 22, 2007               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Accessing MIBs using NETCONF             June 2007


   other security services for SNMP response messages.  Netconf provides
   these services through its transport/application mappings.  Netconf
   does not provide an indicator of which transport mapping will be
   utilized to secure the response message.

   The securityLevel identifies whether authentication and encryption
   services will be used on the response message.  Netconf leaves the
   configuration of authentication and encryption services to the human
   administrator, and does not provide a mechanism-independent indicator
   for the security services provided during transport.  Implicit in
   this design is the assumption that a transport mapping provides a
   constant level of security.  Without an indicator of the services
   provided, access control for netconf cannot be determined based on
   the security properties of the message transport.

   A securityName is a mechanism-independent identifier of the "who" on
   whose behalf SNMP services are provided or processing takes place.
   Netconf provides for the authentication of the "who" on whose behalf
   services are provided or processing takes place, but does not provide
   a mechanism-independent identifier to pass the identity to an access
   control mechanism.

   The viewType is an abstraction for a class of operation; SNMP
   supports read, write, and notify types of operations.  Netconf does
   not yet have a clear description of the types of operations that may
   be supported in the future.  When accessing MIB data with the
   operations described in this memo, a read/write/notify classification
   of operations can be used.

   As described above, the smidump schemas provide mechanisms to
   identify the contextName (context) and instance identifier
   (variableName).

4.  Accessing MIB Capability

4.1.  Description

   The :accessing-mib capability indicates that the server supports MIB
   definitions as data models, and supports retrieving and modifying MIB
   objects in the <running> configuration through the operations
   specified in this memo.

4.2.  Dependencies

   none.

Internet-Draft        Accessing MIBs using NETCONF             June 2007


4.3.  Capability Identifier

   The :accessing-mib capability is identified by the following
   capability string:

   urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:accessing-mib:1.0

4.4.  New Operations

4.4.1.  General NETCONF Operations vs SNMP-specific Operations

   Although the semantics of <mib-get> and <mib-set> operations which
   are proposed in this memo are closely similar to of <get> and <edit-
   config> operations in NETCONF, this memo does not intend to reuse the
   operations in NETCONF.  Because the <mib-get> and <mib-set>
   operations could be freely extended to support the SNMP-specific
   features, for example, the view-based access control model, without
   changing existing NETCONF operations.

4.4.2.  <mib-get>

   Description:

      Retrieve MIB objects from the <running> configuration datastore.
   Attributes:
      max-repetitions:

         The attribute is only applied to subtree filtering.  Entry
         elements in the <config> subtree, such as <ifEntry> and
         <tcpConnEntry>, may contain a "max-repetitions" attribute that
         indicates the maximum number of element instances that the
         client wants to retrieve.  Starting with the given index of the
         entry, the server retrieves an entry instance in
         lexicographical order until either of following conditions
         occurs:
         +  The retrieved number of the entry element instances has
            reached the value of "max-repetitions" attribute.
         +  No more entry element instances are available.
   Parameters:
      filter:

         This parameter specifies the portion of the MIB objects to
         retrieve.  If this parameter is empty, all MIB objects are
         returned.

         The filter element may optionally contain a 'type' attribute.
         This attribute indicates the type of filtering syntax used
         within the filter element.  The default filtering mechanism in

Internet-Draft        Accessing MIBs using NETCONF             June 2007


         this memo is referred to as subtree filtering and is described
         in [RFC4741] Section 6.  The value 'subtree' explicitly
         identifies this type of filtering.

         If the NETCONF peer supports the :xpath capability ([RFC4741]
         Section 8.9), the value 'xpath' may be used to indicate that
         the filter element contains an XPath expression.
   Positive Response:

      If the device was able to satisfy the request, an <rpc-reply> is
      sent.  The <data> section contains the appropriate subset.
   Negative Response:

      An <rpc-error> element is included in the <rpc-reply> if the
      request cannot be completed for any reason. [todo: detail the
      error conditions, and the rpc-error codes that might be returned.]

4.4.3.  <mib-set>

   Description:

      Set MIB objects in the <running> configuration datastore.
   Attributes:
      operation:

         Elements in the <config> subtree may contain an "operation"
         attribute.  The attribute specifies that MIB objects in the
         subtree whose root is identified by the element containing this
         attribute perform the operation.  The attribute MAY appear on
         multiple elements throughout the <config> subtree.  If a MIB
         object locates in multiple overlapped subtrees, which are
         specified different operations, the MIB object perform the
         operation of the smallest subtree.

         If the operation attribute doesn't appear in the <config>
         subtree, all MIB objects in the subtree perform replace
         operation.

         The operation attribute has one of the following values:
         replace:  The MIB objects in the subtree whose root is
            identified by the element containing this attribute replaces
            any related MIB objects in the <running> configuration
            datastore.  This is the default behavior.
         create:  This value is only applied for an entry element.  It
            indicates that create an entry instance as the entry element
            described.
         delete:  This value is only applied for an entry element.  It
            indicates that delete an entry instance as the entry element
            described.

         Although this memo explicitly use the "create" or "delete" verb
         as a value of an "operation" attribute of configuration data in
         a <mib-set> request, the the RowStatus object is still needed.
         Because the RowStatus object is able to temporarily make a
         table entry instance invalid instead of deleting it.  Creating
         and deleting a table entry instance can use either the
         RowStatus object or the "operation" attribute.
   Parameters:
      test-option:

         The test-option element may be specified only if the device
         advertises the :validate capability (Section 8.6).

         The test-option element has one of the following values:

         test-then-set:  Perform a validation test before attempting to
            set.  If validation errors occur, do not perform the <mib-
            set> operation.  This is the default test-option.
         set:  Perform a set without a validation test first.
      error-option:

         The error-option element has one of the following values:
         stop-on-error:  Abort the edit-config operation on first error.
            This is the default error-option.
         continue-on-error:  Continue to process MIB objects on error;
            error is recorded and negative response is generated if any
            errors occur.
         rollback-on-error:  If an error condition occurs such that an
            error severity <rpc-error> element is generated, the server
            will stop processing the edit-config operation and restore
            the specified configuration to its complete state at the
            start of this edit-config operation.  This option requires
            the server to support the :rollback-on-error capability
            described in [RFC4741] Section 8.5.
      config:

         A portion of the MIB tree as defined by a MIB module in XML
         schema.  The contents MUST be placed in an appropriate
         namespace, to allow the device to detect the appropriate MIB
         module.
   Positive Response:

      If the device was able to satisfy the request, an <rpc-reply> is
      sent containing an <ok> element.
   Negative Response:

      An <rpc-error> response is sent if the request cannot be completed
      for any reason.

6.  Security Considerations

   Although this document provides Netconf RPCs to emulate SNMP
   operations to access MIBs, the Netconf protocol does not currently
   have a way to provide the necessary parameters to apply SNMP-based
   access controls.  These parameters are discussed in Section 3.2.

   If implementations are based on implementations of SNMP, then these
   parameters could be provided in an implementation-dependent manner.
   For compatibility, and balanced security, it is RECOMMENDED that such
   implementations provide MIB data access control comparable to the
   View-based Access Control model defined in [RFC3415].

   o  do we need max-repetitions?  It was not kept in the RFC 4088 URI
      format.  Max-repetitions could be useful when retrieving a table
      that contains numerous entries.  The whole table can be retrieved
      by multiple <mib-get> requests.  Otherwise, the size of response
      message will be huge, and it will take a long time to transport
      the message.
   o  Can I xpath filter on arbitrary content?  I assume this is the
      case but that should probably be spelled out (e.g. retrieve all
      interfaces where the name starts with a given prefix - something
      operators find useful).  If this is the case, what is the
      semantics of max-repetitions? an interface is identified by an
      ifIndex in MIBs, not by an interface's name. so it is hard to

      filter interfaces by name or a given prefix. max-repetitions is an
      instruction, not an attribute of data.  It is really a problem
      when it is used in xpath filter.
   o  To complete this work, someone must write a specification how
      smidump actually converts MIB modules to XML schemas so that there
      is agreement how to exchange MIB data.
   o

Appendix B.  Previous Work

   Research was done in the 1990s into integrating SNMP agents with XML-
   based management systems.  The paper [refs.libsmi] discusses some of
   the research that was done.

   The "mibdump" tool is an implementation of the SMI to XML conversion,
   and something that could be connected to a netconf front-end.

   There was a fancy Web wrapper which used xpath to actually select MIB
   data.
