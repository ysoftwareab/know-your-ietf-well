1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes standard definition of MIME types associated 
   with MPEG-4 contents and the guidelines of using them. 
    
   MPEG-4, ISO/IEC 14496, is a standard designed for the representation 
   and delivery of multimedia information over a variety of transport 
   protocols.  It includes interactive scene management, visual and 
   audio representations as well as systems functionality like 
   multiplexing, synchronization, and an object descriptor framework.  
    
   The historical approach for MPEG data is to declare it under "video", 
   and this approach is followed for ISO/IEC 14496.  In addition some 
   MIME types are defined under "audio" and "application" for the 
   streams not belonging to visual presentation. 
    
   Amendment 1 of the ISO/IEC 14496 standard (also known as version 2) 
   includes a standard file type for encapsulating ISO/IEC 14496 data.  
   This file type can be used in a number of ways: perhaps the most 
   important are its use as an interchange format for ISO/IEC 14496 data, 
   its use as a content-download format, and as the format read by 
   streaming media servers. 
    
   These first two uses will be greatly facilitated if there is a 
   standard MIME type for serving these files (e.g. over HTTP). 
    
   The ISO/IEC 14496 standard is broad, and therefore the type of data 
   that may be in such a file can vary. In brief, simple compressed 
   video and audio (using a number of different compression algorithms) 
   can be included; interactive scene information; meta-data about the 
   presentation; references to ISO/IEC 14496 media streams outside the 
   file and so on. Different top-level MIME types are used to identify 
   the type of the contents in the file.

3. Usage of MIME types 
    
3.1 Usage of "video" 
    
   "video" MUST be used for MPEG-4 Visual streams (i.e. video as    
   defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2 (Streamtype = 4) and/or graphics as    
   defined in ISO/IEC 14496-1 (Streamtype = 3)) or MPEG-4 Systems    
   streams that convey information needed for an audio/visual    
   presentation.  
        
3.2 Usage of "audio" 
    
   "audio" MUST be used for MPEG-4 Audio streams (ISO/IEC 14496-3)    
   (Streamtype = 5)) or MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information    
   needed for an audio only presentation.  
        
      
3.3 Usage of "application" 
    
   "application" MUST be used for MPEG-4 Systems streams (ISO/IEC14496-1 
   (all other StreamType values)) that serve other purposes than 
   audio/visual presentation, e.g. in some cases when MPEG-J streams are 
   transmitted.  
    
3.4 MIME types for MP4 file

   Amendment 1 of the ISO/IEC 14496 standard (also known as version 2) 
   includes a standard file type for encapsulating ISO/IEC 14496 data.  
   This file type can be used in a number of ways: perhaps the most 
   important are its use as an interchange format for ISO/IEC 14496 data, 
   its use as a content-download format, and as the format read by 
   streaming media servers. 
    
   These first two uses will be greatly facilitated if there is a 
   standard MIME type for serving these files (e.g. over HTTP). 
    
   The ISO/IEC 14496 standard is broad, and therefore the type of data 
   that may be in such a file can vary. In brief, simple compressed 
   video and audio (using a number of different compression algorithms) 
   can be included; interactive scene information; meta-data about the 
   presentation; references to ISO/IEC 14496 media streams outside the 
   file and so on. 
    
   The MIME types to be assigned to MP4 files SHOULD be "audio/mp4", and 
   "video/mp4" , based on the criteria in 5.1 û 5.3. In either case, 
   these indicate files conforming to the "MP4" specification (ISO/IEC 
   14496-1:2000, systems file format). 
    
   When an MP4 file is served (e.g. over HTTP) or otherwise must be 
   identified by a MIME type, the type "video/mp4" SHOULD be used.  The 
   types "audio/mp4" MAY be used when the ISO/IEC 14496 presentation 
   contained within the MP4 file has no visual presentation and refers 
   to a pure audio presentation. 
    
3.5 MIME types for elementary streams 
    
   When a visual ISO/IEC 14496 ES is served (e.g. over HTTP or 
   otherwise) and must be identified by a MIME type, the type 
   "video/MPEG4-visual" SHALL be used. This MIME type may require 
   optional parameters to carry all necessary information to configure a 
   receiver: therefore no further meta-information (such as that defined 
   by the MP4 file format or by the ISO/IEC 14496 Object Descriptor 
   framework) has to be provided in the data, and the data itself merely 
   represents the media content..  The format of the bit-stream, 
   including timing etc., is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2. 
    
   The payload names used in an RTPMAP attribute within SDP, to specify 
   the mapping of payload number to its definition, also come from the 
   MIME namespace.  Each of the RTP payload mappings defined above has a 
   distinct name.  It is recommended that visual streams be identified 
   under "video", and audio streams be identified under "audio", and 
   otherwise "application" be used. 
    
3.6 MIME types for IOD 
    
 
 
Lim & Singer           Expires - November 2002               [Page 6] 
                   MIME Type Registration for MPEG-4         June 2002 
 
 
   In some cases, the initial object descriptor needs to be identified 
   with a MIME type. In this case, the type "applications/mpeg4-iod" 
   shall be supported, and the type "application/mpeg4-iod-xmt" may be 
   supported. In the latter case, the IOD will be described in an XMT 
   textual format. The InitialObjectDescriptor is defined in sub-clause 
   8.6.3.1 of ISO/IEC 14496-1, and its XMT format is defined in ISO/IEC 
   14496-1:2001 PDAM 2.  
    
    
Security Considerations 
    
   RTP packets using the payload formats referred to in this 
   specification are subject to the security considerations discussed in 
   the RTP specification [iii]. This implies that confidentiality of the 
   media streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression 
   used with this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may 
   be performed on the compressed data so there is no conflict between 
   the two operations. The packet processing complexity of this payload 
   type does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in the receiver 
   side to cause a denial-of-service threat. 
    
   However, it is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, 
   Video, and Systems) to overload the receiver/decoder's buffers which 
   might compromise the functionality of the receiver or even crash it. 
   This is especially true for end-to-end systems like MPEG where the 
   buffer models are precisely defined. 
    
   ISO/IEC 14496 Systems supports stream types including commands that 
   are executed on the terminal like OD commands, BIFS commands, etc. 
   and programmatic content like MPEG-J (Java(TM) Byte Code) and 
   ECMASCRIPT. It is possible to use one or more of the above in a 
   manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash or temporarily make the 
   receiver unavailable.  
    
   Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of the sender and 
   the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant 
   ISO/IEC 14496 streams. 
    
   A security model is defined in ISO/IEC 14496 Systems streams carrying 
   MPEG-J access units which comprises Java(TM) classes and objects. 
   MPEG-J defines a set of Java APIs and a secure execution model. MPEG-
   J content can call this set of APIs and Java(TM) methods from a set 
   of Java packages supported in the receiver within the defined 
   security model. According to this security model, downloaded byte 
   code is forbidden to load libraries, define native methods, start 
   programs, read or write files, or read system properties. 
    
   Receivers can implement intelligent filters to validate the buffer 
   requirements or parametric (OD, BIFS, etc.) or programmatic (MPEG-J,

   ECMAScript) commands in the streams. However, this can increase the 
   complexity significantly.
