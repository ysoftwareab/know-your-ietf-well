  Patch and Fetch Methods for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
                      draft-ietf-core-etch-04

Abstract

   The methods defined in RFC 7252 for the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) only allow access to a complete resource, not to
   parts of a resource.  In case of resources with larger or complex
   data, or in situations where a resource continuity is required,
   replacing or requesting the whole resource is undesirable.  Several
   applications using CoAP will need to perform partial resource
   accesses.

   This specification defines the new CoAP methods, FETCH, PATCH and
   iPATCH, which are used to access and update parts of a resource.

1.  Introduction

   Similar to HTTP, the GET method defined in [RFC7252] for the
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) only allows the specification
   of a URI and request parameters in CoAP options, not the transfer of
   a request payload detailing the request.  This leads to some

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


   applications to using POST where actually a cacheable, idempotent,
   safe request is desired.

   Again similar to the original specification of HTTP, the PUT method
   defined in [RFC7252] only allows to replace a complete resource.
   This also leads applications to use POST where actually a cacheable,
   possibly idempotent request is desired.

   The present specification adds new CoAP methods: FETCH, to perform
   the equivalent of a GET with a request body; and the twin methods
   PATCH and iPATCH, to modify parts of a CoAP resource.

1.1.  FETCH

   The CoAP GET method [RFC7252] is used to obtain the representation of
   a resource, where the resource is specified by a URI and additional
   request parameters can additionally shape the representation.  This
   has been modelled after the HTTP GET operation and the REST model in
   general.

   In HTTP, a resource is often used to search for information, and
   existing systems varyingly use the HTTP GET and POST methods to
   perform a search.  Often a POST method is used for the sole reason
   that a larger set of parameters to the search can be supplied in the
   request body than can comfortably be transferred in the URI with a
   GET request.  The draft [I-D.snell-search-method] proposes a SEARCH
   method that is similar to GET in most properties but enables sending
   a request body as with POST.  The FETCH method defined in the present
   specification is inspired by [I-D.snell-search-method], which updates
   the definition and semantics of the HTTP SEARCH request method
   previously defined by [RFC5323].  However, there is no intention to
   limit FETCH to search-type operations, and the resulting properties
   may not be the same as those of HTTP SEARCH.

   A major problem with GET is that the information that controls the
   request needs to be bundled up in some unspecified way into the URI.
   Using the request body for this information has a number of
   advantages:

   o  The client can specify a media type (and a content encoding),
      enabling the server to unambiguously interpret the request
      parameters in the context of that media type.  Also, the request
      body is not limited by the character set limitations of URIs,
      enabling a more natural (and more efficient) representation of
      certain domain-specific parameters.

   o  The request parameters are not limited by the maximum size of the
      URI.  In HTTP, that is a problem as the practical limit for this



van der Stok, et al.      Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


      size varies.  In CoAP, another problem is that the block-wise
      transfer is not available for transferring large URI options in
      multiple rounds.

   As an alternative to using GET, many implementations make use of the
   POST method to perform extended requests, even if they are
   semantically idempotent, safe, and even cacheable, to be able to pass
   along the input parameters within the request payload as opposed to
   using the request URI.

   The FETCH method provides a solution that spans the gap between the
   use of GET and POST.  As with POST, the input to the FETCH operation
   is passed along within the payload of the request rather than as part
   of the request URI.  Unlike POST, however the semantics of the FETCH
   method are more specifically defined.

1.2.  PATCH and iPATCH

   PATCH is also specified for HTTP in [RFC5789].  Most of the
   motivation for PATCH described in [RFC5789] also applies here. iPATCH
   is the idempotent version of PATCH.

   The PUT method exists to overwrite a resource with completely new
   contents, and cannot be used to perform partial changes.  When using
   PUT for partial changes, proxies and caches, and even clients and
   servers, may get confused as to the result of the operation.  PATCH
   was not adopted in an early design stage of CoAP, however, it has
   become necessary with the arrival of applications that require
   partial updates to resources (e.g.  [I-D.vanderstok-core-comi]).
   Using PATCH avoids transferring all data associated with a resource
   in case of modifications, thereby not burdening the constrained
   communication medium.

   This document relies on knowledge of the PATCH specification for HTTP
   [RFC5789].  This document provides extracts from [RFC5789] to make
   independent reading possible.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

1.4.  Terminology and Acronyms

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC5789] and [RFC7252].

   Specifically, it uses the terms "safe" and "idempotent" as defined in
   Section 5.1 of [RFC7252].  (Further discussion of safe and idempotent
   methods can now be found in Section 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 of [RFC7231],
   respectively; the implications of idempotency of methods on server
   implementations are also discussed in Section 4.5 of [RFC7252].)

2.  FETCH Method

   The CoAP FETCH method is used to obtain a representation of a
   resource, giving a number of request parameters.  Unlike the CoAP GET
   method, which requests that a server return a representation of the
   resource identified by the effective request URI (as defined by
   [RFC7252]), the FETCH method is used by a client to ask the server to
   produce a representation as described by the request parameters
   (including the request options and the payload) based on the resource
   specified by the effective request URI.  The payload returned in
   response to a FETCH cannot be assumed to be a complete representation
   of the resource identified by the effective request URI, i.e., it
   cannot be used by a cache as a payload to be returned by a GET
   request.

   Together with the request options, the body of the request (which may
   be constructed from multiple payloads using the block protocol
   [RFC7959]) defines the request parameters.  With the FETCH method,
   implementations may submit a request body of any media type that is
   defined with the semantics of selecting information from a resource
   in such a FETCH request; it is outside the scope of this document how
   information about media types admissible for the specific resource is
   obtained by the client (although we can hint that form relations
   ([I-D.hartke-core-apps]) might be a preferred way).  It is
   RECOMMENDED that any discovery method that allows a client to find
   out that the server supports FETCH also provides information what
   FETCH payload media types are applicable.

   FETCH requests are both safe and idempotent with regards to the
   resource identified by the request URI.  That is, the performance of
   a fetch is not intended to alter the state of the targeted resource.
   (However, while processing a fetch request, a server can be expected
   to allocate computing and memory resources or even create additional
   server resources through which the response to the search can be
   retrieved.)

   A successful response to a FETCH request is expected to provide some
   indication as to the final disposition of the requested operation.



van der Stok, et al.      Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


   If a successful response includes a body payload, the payload is
   expected to describe the results of the FETCH operation.

   Depending on the response code as defined by [RFC7252], the response
   to a FETCH request is cacheable; the request body is part of the
   cache key.  Specifically, 2.05 "Content" response codes, the
   responses for which are cacheable, are a usual way to respond to a
   FETCH request.  (Note that this aspect differs markedly from
   [I-D.snell-search-method].)  (Note also that caches that cannot use
   the request payload as part of the cache key will not be able to
   cache responses to FETCH requests at all.)  The Max-Age option in the
   response has equivalent semantics to its use in a GET.

   The semantics of the FETCH method change to a "conditional FETCH" if
   the request message includes an If-Match, or If-None-Match option
   ([RFC7252]).  A conditional FETCH requests that the query be
   performed only under the circumstances described by the conditional
   option(s).  It is important to note, however, that such conditions
   are evaluated against the state of the target resource itself as
   opposed to the results of the FETCH operation.

2.1.  Response Codes

   FETCH for CoAP adopts the response codes as specified in sections 5.9
   and 12.1.2 of [RFC7252] as well as additional response codes
   mentioned in Section 2.2.

2.2.  Error Handling

   A FETCH request may fail under certain known conditions.  Beyond the
   conditions already defined in [RFC7252] for GET, noteworthy ones are:

   Malformed FETCH payload:  If a server determines that the payload
      provided with a FETCH request is not properly formatted, it can
      return a 4.00 (Bad Request) CoAP error.  The definition of a
      malformed payload depends upon the CoAP Content-Format specified
      with the request.

   Unsupported FETCH payload:  In case a client sends a payload that is
      inappropriate for the resource identified by the Request-URI, the
      server can return a 4.15 (Unsupported Content-Format) CoAP error.
      The server can determine if the payload is supported by checking
      the CoAP Content-Format specified with the request.

   Unprocessable request:  This situation occurs when the payload of a
      FETCH request is determined as valid, i.e. well-formed and
      supported, however, the server is unable to or incapable of
      processing the request.  The server can return a 4.22



van der Stok, et al.      Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


      (Unprocessable Entity) CoAP error.  In situations when the server
      has insufficient computing resources to complete the request
      successfully, it can return a 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) CoAP
      error (see also below).  In case there are more specific errors
      that provide more insight into the problem, then those should be
      used.

   Request too large:  If the payload of the FETCH request is larger
      than a CoAP server can process, then it can return the 4.13
      (Request Entity Too Large) CoAP error.

   It is possible that other error situations, not mentioned here, are
   encountered by a CoAP server while processing the FETCH request.  In
   these situations other appropriate CoAP status codes can also be
   returned.

2.3.  Option Numbers

   FETCH for CoAP adopts the option numbers as specified in sections
   5.10 and 12.2 of [RFC7252].

   Generally, options defined for GET act in an analogous way for FETCH.
   Two specific cases are called out in the rest of this section.

2.3.1.  The Content-Format Option

   A FETCH request MUST include a Content-Format option (see
   Section 5.10.3 of [RFC7252]) to specify the media type and content
   encoding of the request body.  (Typically, the media type will
   specifically have been designed to specify details for a selection or
   a search on a resource.)

2.3.2.  The ETag Option

   The ETag Option on a FETCH result has the same semantics as defined
   in Section 5.10.6 of [RFC7252].  In particular, its use as a response
   option describes the "tagged representation", which for FETCH is the
   same as the "selected representation".  The FETCH payload is input to
   that selection process and therefore needs to be part of the cache
   key.  Similarly, the use of ETag as a request option can elicit a
   2.03 Valid response if the representation associated with the ETag
   would still be selected by the FETCH request (including its payload).

2.4.  Working with Observe

   The Observe option [RFC7641] can be used with a FETCH request as it
   can be used with a GET request.

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


2.5.  Working with Block

   The Block1 option [RFC7959] can be used with a FETCH request as it
   would be used with a POST request; the Block2 option can then be used
   as with GET or POST.

2.6.  Building FETCH Requests

   One property of FETCH that may be non-obvious is that a FETCH request
   cannot be generated from a link alone, but also needs a way to
   generate the request payload.  Again, form relations
   ([I-D.hartke-core-apps]) may be able to fill parts of this gap.

2.7.  A Simple Example for FETCH

   The FETCH method needs a media type for its payload (as expressed by
   the Content-Format request option) that specifies the search query in
   a similar detail as is shown for the patch payload in the PATCH
   example in Section 3.1.  ([I-D.snell-search-method] invents a "text/
   query" format based on some hypothetical SQL dialect for its
   examples.)

   The example below illustrates retrieval of a subset of a JSON
   [RFC7159] object (the same object as used in Section 3.1).  Using a
   hypothetical media type "application/example-map-keys+json" (with a
   Content-Format ID of NNN - not defined as this is just an example),
   the client specifies the items in the object that it wants: it
   supplies a JSON array giving the map keys for these items.  A
   resource located at "coap://www.example.com/object" can be
   represented by a JSON document that we will consider as the target of
   the FETCH.  The client wants to learn the contents of the single map
   key "foo" within this target:

   {
     "x-coord": 256,
     "y-coord": 45,
     "foo": ["bar","baz"]
   }

               FETCH example: JSON document returned by GET

   The example FETCH request specifies a single top-level member desired
   by giving its map key as the sole element of the "example-map-keys"
   payload:

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


   FETCH CoAP://www.example.com/object
   Content-Format: NNN (application/example-map-keys+json)
   Accept: application/json
   [
     "foo"
   ]

                          FETCH example: Request

   The server returns a subset document with just the selected member:

   2.05 Content
   Content-Format: 50 (application/json)
   {
     "foo": ["bar","baz"]
   }

             FETCH example: Response with subset JSON document

   By the logic of this example, the requester could have entered more
   than one map key into the request payload array and would have
   received a more complete subset of the top-level JSON object that is
   representing the resource.

3.  PATCH and iPATCH Methods

   The PATCH and iPATCH methods request that a set of changes described
   in the request payload is applied to the target resource of the
   request.  The set of changes is represented in a format identified by
   a media type.  If the Request-URI does not point to an existing
   resource, the server MAY create a new resource with that URI,
   depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify
   a null resource) and permissions, as well as other conditions such as
   the degree of control the server gives clients in creating new
   entries in its URI space (see also Section 3.4).  Creation of a new
   resource would result in a 2.01 (Created) Response Code dependent on
   the patch document type.

   Restrictions to a PATCH or iPATCH request can be made by including
   the If-Match or If-None-Match options in the request (see
   Section 5.10.8.1 and 5.10.8.2 of [RFC7252]).  If the resource could
   not be created or modified, then an appropriate Error Response Code
   SHOULD be sent.

   The difference between the PUT and PATCH requests is documented in
   [RFC5789].  When a request is intended to effect a partial update of
   a given resource, clients cannot use PUT while supplying just the
   update, but might be able to use PATCH or iPATCH.

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


   The PATCH method is not safe and not idempotent, as with the HTTP
   PATCH method specified in [RFC5789].

   The iPATCH method is not safe but idempotent, as with the CoAP PUT
   method specified in [RFC7252], Section 5.8.3.

   A client can mark a request as idempotent by using the iPATCH method
   instead of the PATCH method.  This is the only difference between the
   two.  The indication of idempotence may enable the server to keep
   less state about the interaction; some constrained servers may only
   implement the iPATCH variant for this reason.

   PATCH and iPATCH are both atomic.  The server MUST apply the entire
   set of changes atomically and never provide a partially modified
   representation to a concurrently executed GET request.  Given the
   constrained nature of the servers, most servers will only execute
   CoAP requests consecutively, thus preventing a concurrent partial
   overlapping of request modifications.  Resuming, modifications MUST
   NOT be applied to the server state when an error occurs or only a
   partial execution is possible on the resources present in the server.

   The atomicity applies to a single server.  When a PATCH or iPATCH
   request is multicast to a set of servers, each server can either
   execute all required modifications or not.  It is not required that
   all servers execute all modifications or none.  An Atomic Commit
   protocol that provides multiple server atomicity is out of scope.

   A PATCH or iPATCH response can invalidate a cache as with the PUT
   response.  Caching behaviour as function of the successful (2.xx)
   response codes for PATCH or iPATCH are:

   o  A 2.01 (Created) response invalidates any cache entry for the
      resource indicated by the Location-* Options; the payload is a
      representation of the action result.

   o  A 2.04 (Changed) response invalidates any cache entry for the
      target resource; the payload is a representation of the action
      result.

   There is no guarantee that a resource can be modified with PATCH or
   iPATCH.  Servers MUST ensure that a received PATCH body is
   appropriate for the type of resource identified by the target
   resource of the request.

   It is RECOMMENDED that any discovery method that allows a client to
   find out that the server supports one of PATCH and iPATCH also

   and which of the two methods are implemented by the server for each
   of these media types.

   Servers that do not rely on the idempotency of iPATCH can easily
   support both PATCH and iPATCH, and it is RECOMMENDED they do so.
   This is inexpensive to do, as, for iPATCH, there is no requirement on
   the server to check that the client's intention that the request be
   idempotent is fulfilled (although there is diagnostic value in that
   check, so a less-constrained implementation may want to perform it).

3.1.  Simple Examples for PATCH and iPATCH

   The example is taken over from [RFC6902], which specifies a JSON
   notation for PATCH operations.  A resource located at
   coap://www.example.com/object contains a target JSON document.

   JSON document original state:
       {
         "x-coord": 256,
         "y-coord": 45,
         "foo": ["bar","baz"]
       }

   REQ: iPATCH CoAP://www.example.com/object
   Content-Format: 51 (application/json-patch+json)
       [
         { "op":"replace", "path":"x-coord", "value":45}
       ]

   RET: CoAP 2.04 Changed

   JSON document final state:
       {
         "x-coord": 45,
         "y-coord": 45,
         "foo": ["bar","baz"]
       }

   This example illustrates use of an idempotent modification to the
   x-coord member of the existing resource "object".  The 2.04 (Changed)
   response code is conform with the CoAP PUT method.

   The same example using the Content-Format application/merge-
   patch+json from [RFC7396] looks like:

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


   JSON document original state:
       {
         "x-coord": 256,
         "y-coord": 45,
         "foo": ["bar","baz"]
       }

   REQ: iPATCH CoAP://www.example.com/object
   Content-Format: 52 (application/merge-patch+json)
        { "x-coord":45}

   RET: CoAP 2.04 Changed

   JSON document final state:
       {
         "x-coord": 45,
         "y-coord": 45,
         "foo": ["bar","baz"]
       }

   The examples show the use of the iPATCH method, but the use of the
   PATCH method would have led to the same result.  Below a non-
   idempotent modification is shown.  Because the action is non-
   idempotent, iPATCH returns an error, while PATCH executes the action.

3.2.  Response Codes

   PATCH and iPATCH for CoAP adopt the response codes as specified in
   sections 5.9 and 12.1.2 of [RFC7252] and add 4.09 "Conflict" and 4.22
   "Unprocessable Entity" with the semantics specified in Section 3.4 of
   the present specification.

3.3.  Option Numbers

   PATCH and iPATCH for CoAP adopt the option numbers as specified in
   sections 5.10 and 12.2 of [RFC7252].

3.4.  Error Handling

   A PATCH or iPATCH request may fail under certain known conditions.
   These situations should be dealt with as expressed below.

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


   Malformed PATCH or iPATCH payload:  If a server determines that the
      payload provided with a PATCH or iPATCH request is not properly
      formatted, it can return a 4.00 (Bad Request) CoAP error.  The
      definition of a malformed payload depends upon the CoAP Content-
      Format specified with the request.

   Unsupported PATCH or iPATCH payload:  In case a client sends a
      payload that is inappropriate for the resource identified by the
      Request-URI, the server can return a 4.15 (Unsupported Content-
      Format) CoAP error.  The server can determine if the payload is
      supported by checking the CoAP Content-Format specified with the
      request.

   Unprocessable request:  This situation occurs when the payload of a
      PATCH request is determined as valid, i.e. well-formed and
      supported, however, the server is unable to or incapable of
      processing the request.  The server can return a 4.22
      (Unprocessable Entity) CoAP error.  More specific scenarios might
      include situations when:

      *  the server has insufficient computing resources to complete the
         request successfully -- 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) CoAP
         Response Code (see below),

      *  the resource specified in the request becomes invalid by
         applying the payload -- 4.09 (Conflict) CoAP Response Code (see
         below)).

      In case there are more specific errors that provide more insight
      into the problem, then those should be used.

   Resource not found:  The 4.04 (Not Found) error should be returned in
      case the payload of a PATCH request cannot be applied to a non-
      existent resource.

   Failed precondition:  In case the client uses the conditional If-
      Match or If-None-Match option to define a precondition for the
      PATCH request, and that precondition fails, then the server can
      return the 4.12 (Precondition Failed) CoAP error.

   Request too large:  If the payload of the PATCH request is larger
      than a CoAP server can process, then it can return the 4.13
      (Request Entity Too Large) CoAP error.

   Conflicting state:  If the modification specified by a PATCH or
      iPATCH request causes the resource to enter an inconsistent state
      that the server cannot resolve, the server can return the 4.09
      (Conflict) CoAP response.  The server SHOULD generate a payload



van der Stok, et al.      Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Fetch Patch               November 2016


      that includes enough information for a user to recognize the
      source of the conflict.  The server MAY return the actual resource
      state to provide the client with the means to create a new
      consistent resource state.  Such a situation might be encountered
      when a structural modification is applied to a configuration data-
      store, but the structures being modified do not exist.

   Concurrent modification:  Resource constrained devices might need to
      process requests in the order they are received.  In case requests
      are received concurrently to modify the same resource but they
      cannot be queued, the server can return a 5.03 (Service
      unavailable) CoAP response code.

   Conflict handling failure:  If the modification implies the
      reservation of resources or the waiting on conditions to become
      true, leading to a too long request execution time, the server can
      return 5.03 (service unavailable) response code.

   It is possible that other error situations, not mentioned here, are
   encountered by a CoAP server while processing the PATCH request.  In
   these situations other appropriate CoAP status codes can also be
   returned.

4.  The New Set of CoAP Methods

   Adding three new methods to CoAP's existing four may seem like a
   major change.  However, both FETCH and the two PATCH variants fit
   well into the REST paradigm and have been anticipated on the HTTP
   side.  Adding both a non-idempotent and an idempotent PATCH variant
   allows to keep interoperability with HTTP's PATCH method as well as
   the use/indication of an idempotent PATCH if that is possible, saving
   significant effort on the server side.

   Interestingly, the three new methods fit into the old table of
   methods with a surprising similarity in the idempotence and safety
   attributes:

           +------+--------+------+--------+------+------------+
           | Code | Name   | Code | Name   | safe | idempotent |
           +------+--------+------+--------+------+------------+
           | 0.01 | GET    | 0.05 | FETCH  | yes  | yes        |
           | 0.02 | POST   | 0.06 | PATCH  | no   | no         |
           | 0.03 | PUT    | 0.07 | iPATCH | no   | yes        |
           | 0.04 | DELETE |      |        | no   | yes        |
           +------+--------+------+--------+------+------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   This section analyses the possible threats to the CoAP FETCH and
   PATCH or iPATCH methods.  It is meant to inform protocol and
   application developers about the security limitations of CoAP FETCH
   and PATCH or iPATCH as described in this document.

   The FETCH method is subject to the same general security
   considerations as all CoAP methods as described in Section 11 of
   [RFC7252].  Specifically, the security considerations for FETCH are
   closest to those of GET, except that the FETCH request carries a
   payload that may need additional protection.  The payload of a FETCH
   request may reveal more detailed information about the specific
   portions of a resource of interest to the requester than a GET
   request for the entire resource would; this may mean that
   confidentiality protection of the request by DTLS or other means is
   needed for FETCH where it wouldn't be needed for GET.

   The PATCH and iPATCH methods are subject to the same general security
   considerations as all CoAP methods as described in Section 11 of
   [RFC7252].  The specific security considerations for PATCH or iPATCH
   are nearly identical to the security considerations for PUT
   ([RFC7252]); the security considerations of Section 5 of [RFC5789]
   also apply to PATCH and iPATCH.  Specifically, there is likely to be
   a need for authorizing requests (possibly through access control and/
   or authentication) and for ensuring that data is not corrupted
   through transport errors or through accidental overwrites.  The
   mechanisms used for PUT can be used for PATCH or iPATCH as well.

   The new methods defined in the present specification are secured
   following the CoAP recommendations for the existing methods as
   specified in section 9 of [RFC7252].  When additional security
   techniques are standardized for CoAP (e.g., Object Security), these
   are then also available for securing the new methods.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the sub-registry
   "CoAP Method Codes":

                       +------+--------+-----------+
                       | Code | Name   | Reference |
                       +------+--------+-----------+
                       | 0.05 | FETCH  | [RFCthis] |
                       | 0.06 | PATCH  | [RFCthis] |
                       | 0.07 | iPATCH | [RFCthis] |
                       +------+--------+-----------+

   The FETCH method is idempotent and safe, and it returns the same
   response codes that GET can return, plus 4.13 (Request Entity Too
   Large), 4.15 (Unsupported Content-Format), and 4.22 (Unprocessable
   Entity) with the semantics specified in Section 2.2.

   The PATCH method is neither idempotent nor safe.  It returns the same
   response codes that POST can return, plus 4.09 (Conflict) and 4.22
   (Unprocessable Entity) with the semantics specified in Section 3.4.

   The iPATCH method is identical to the PATCH method, except that it is
   idempotent.

   IANA is requested to add the following code to the sub-registry "CoAP
   response codes":

                +------+----------------------+-----------+
                | Code | Name                 | Reference |
                +------+----------------------+-----------+
                | 4.09 | Conflict             | [RFCthis] |
                | 4.22 | Unprocessable Entity | [RFCthis] |
                +------+----------------------+-----------+

   IANA is requested to add entries to the sub-registry "CoAP Content-
   Formats", within the "CoRE Parameters" registry:

       +------------------------------+----------+----+-----------+
       | Media Type                   | Encoding | ID | Reference |
       +------------------------------+----------+----+-----------+
       | application/json-patch+json  |          | 51 | [RFC6902] |
       | application/merge-patch+json |          | 52 | [RFC7396] |
       +------------------------------+----------+----+-----------+

   Editors' note (to be removed by RFC editor): RFC 6902 and RFC 7396
   are not necessary to implement the present specification, not even an
   option for it.  It was just convenient to use the present document to
   register content-format identifiers for them (and they are used in
   examples).  Therefore, these references are correctly classified as
   _informative_.

7.  Change log

   When published as an RFC, this section needs to be removed.

   Version 00 is a composition from draft-vanderstok-core-patch-03 and
   draft-bormann-core-coap-fetch-00 and replaces these two drafts.

   Version 01 added an example for FETCH and is more explicit about some
   response codes and options.
