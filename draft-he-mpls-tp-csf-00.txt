Internet-Draft    Indication of Client Failure in MPLS-TP     July 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document describes a Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport 
   Profile (MPLS-TP) Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) 
   tool to propagate a client failure indication across an MPLS-TP 
   network in case the propagation of failure status in the client layer 
   is not supported.

1. Introduction 

   In transport network OAM functionalities are important and 
   fundamental to ease operational complexity, enhance network 
   availability and meet service performance objectives by efficient and 
   automatic detection, handling, diagnosis and appropriate reporting of 
   defects and performance monitoring. 

   In the case of server layer defects detected in a transport network, 
   normally an AIS/FDI is generated for the downstream client signal as 
   an indication to the downstream network elements that the Client 
   signal is missing due to a server layer defect.  

   In cases where the client service to be carried by MPLS-TP networks 
   does not provide mechanisms to propagate its failure information 
   across MPLS-TP networks (e.g. not needed in the original application 
   of the client signal, the signal was originally at the bottom of the 
   layer stack and it was not expected to be transported over a server 
   layer), while such an indication is needed by the downstream, it is

   necessary that MPLS-TP OAM provides such a tool to help propagate 
   client failure indication to the far end on detection of a failure of 
   the ingress client signal. 

   This document defines a MPLS-TP OAM tool as Client Signal Fail 
   indication (CSF) to propagate client failures and their clearance 
   across a MPLS-TP domain. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]. 

2.1. Terminology 

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in MPLS-TP. 
   The relationship between ITU-T and IETF terminologies on MPLS-TP can 
   be found in [Rosetta stone]. 

       ACH: Associated Channel Header 

       AIS: Alarm Indication Signal 

       CSF: Client Signal Fail indication 

       FDI: Forward Defect Indication 

       LSR: Label Switching Router 

       MEP: Maintenance End Point 

       MIP: Maintenance Intermediate Point 

       OAM: Operations, Administration and Maintenance 

       MPLS-TP: MPLS Transport Profile 

       RDI: Remote Defect Indication 

3. Mechanisms of CSF 

3.1. General  

   Client Signal Fail indication (CSF) provides a function to enable a 
   MEP to propagate a client failure indication to its peer MEP across a

   MPLS-TP network in case the client service itself does not support 
   propagation of its failure status.  

   Packets with CSF information can be issued by a MEP, upon receiving 
   failure information from its client service. Detection rules for 
   client failure events are client-specific and are therefore outside 
   the scope of this document.

                         Figure 1 Use case of CSF 

   Figure 1 depicts a typical connection scenario between two client 
   network elements (Node A and Node D) interconnected through MPLS-TP 
   transport network. Client Node A connects to MPLS-TP Node B and 
   Client Node D connects to MPLS-TP Node C. Node B and C support MPLS-
   TP MEP function. 

   If a failure is detected between Node A and Node B and is taken as a 
   native client failure condition, the MEP function in Node B will 
   initiate CSF signal and it will be sent to Node C through MPLS-TP 
   network. CSF signal will be extracted at Node C as an indication of 
   client signal failure. Further, this may be mapped back into native 
   client failure indication and regenerated towards client Node D. 

   Node B learns the failure between A and B either by direct detection 
   of signal fail (e.g. loss of signal) or by some fault indications 
   between A and B (e.g. RDI, AIS/FDI).  

   If the connection between Node A and B recovers, Node B may stop 
   sending CSF signals to Node C (implicit failure clearance mechanism) 
   or explicitly send failure clearance indication (e.g. by flags in CSF 
   PDU format) to Node C to help expedite clearance of native client 
   failure conditions. 

   Accordingly, Node C will clear client failure condition when no CSF 
   is received (implicit failure clearance mechanism) or upon receiving 
   explicit failure clearance indication. 

   Consideration of client failure clearance is to be added in the 
   following part in the further version of this document.

3.2. Transmission of CSF 

   Upon learning signal failure condition of its client-layer the MEP 
   can immediately start transmitting periodic packets with CSF 
   information. A MEP continues to transmit periodic packets with CSF 
   information until the client-layer signal failure condition is 
   cleared. 

   The period of CSF generation is for further study. 

3.3. Reception of CSF  

   Upon receiving a packet with CSF information a MEP declares a client-
   layer signal fail condition and forwards this as a signal fail 
   indication to its client-layer.  

3.4. Configuration of CSF  

   Specific configuration information required by a MEP to support CSF 
   transmission is the following: 

   CSF transmission period - this is application dependent. For further 
   study. 

   PHB - identifies the per-hop behavior of packet with CSF information. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with CSF information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support CSF functionality. 

4. Frame format of CSF 

   Figure 2 depicts the frame format of CSF. CSF PDUs are encapsulated 
   using the ACH, according to [RFC 5586].
