1.  Introduction

   The ATRAC family of perceptual audio codecs is designed to address
   numerous needs for high-quality, low bit-rate audio transfer.  ATRAC
   technology can be found in many consumer and professional products
   and applications, including MD players, CD players, voice recorders,
   and mobile phones.  

   Recent advances in ATRAC technology allow for multiple channels of
   audio to be encoded in customizable groupings.  This should allow 
   for future expansions in scaled streaming.  To provide the greatest
   flexibility in streaming any one of the ATRAC family member codecs,
   however, this payload format does not distinguish between the codecs
   on a packet level.

   This simplified payload format contains only the basic information
   needed to disassemble a packet of ATRAC audio in order to decode it.
   There is also basic support for fragmentation and redundancy.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [4].

3.  Codec Specific Details

   Early versions of the ATRAC codec handled only two channels of audio
   at 44.1kHz sampling frequency, with typical bit-rates between 66kbps
   and 132kbps.  The latest version allows for a maximum 8 channels of
   audio, up to 96kHz in sampling frequency, and a lossless encoding
   option which can be transmitted in either a scalable (also known as
   High-Speed Transfer mode) or standard (aka Standard mode) format.
   The feasible bit-rate range has also expanded, allowing from a low of
   8kbps up to 1400kbps in lossy encoding modes.

   Depending on the version of ATRAC used, the sample-frame size is
   either 512, 1024 or 2048 samples.  While the lossy and Standard mode
   lossless formats are encoded as sequential single audio frames, 
   High-Speed Transfer mode lossless data comprises two layers -- a 
   lossy base layer and an enhancement layer.
   Although streaming of multi-channel audio is supported depending on
   the ATRAC version used, all encoded audio for a given time period is
   contained within a single frame.  Therefore, there is no interleaving
   nor splitting of audio data on a per-channel basis to be concerned
   with.

4.  RTP Packetization and Transport of ATRAC-Family Streams

4.1  ATRAC Frames

   For transportation of compressed audio data, ATRAC uses the concept
   of frames.  ATRAC frames are the smallest data unit for which timing
   information is attributed.  Frames are octet-aligned by definition.

4.2  Concatenation of Frames

   It is often possible to carry multiple frames in one RTP packet.
   This can be useful in audio, where on a LAN with a 1500 byte MTU, an
   average of 7 complete 64kbps ATRAC frames could be carried in a
   single RTP packet, as each ATRAC frame would be approximately 200
   bytes.  ATRAC frames may be of fixed or variable length.  To
   facilitate parsing in the case of multiple frames in one RTP packet,
   the size of each frame is made known to the receiver by carrying "in
   band" the frame size for each contained frame in an RTP packet.
   However, to simplify the implementation of RTP receivers, it is
   required that when multiple frames are carried in an RTP packet, each
   frame MUST be complete, i.e., the number of frames in an RTP packet
   MUST be integral.

4.3  Frame Fragmentation

   The ATRAC codec can handle very large frames.  As most IP networks
   have significantly smaller MTU sizes than the frame sizes ATRAC can
   handle, this payload format allows for the fragmentation of an ATRAC
   frame over multiple RTP packets.  However, to simplify the
   implementation of RTP receivers, an RTP packet MUST either carry one
   or more complete ATRAC frames or a single fragment of one ATRAC
   frame.  In other words, RTP packets MUST NOT contain fragments of
   multiple ATRAC frames and MUST NOT contain a mix of complete and
   fragmented frames.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-24.txt        May, 2009


4.4  Transmission of Redundant Frames

   As RTP does not guarantee reliable transmission, receipt of data is
   not assured.  Loss of a packet can result in a "decoding gap" at the
   receiver.  One method to remedy this problem is to allow time-shifted
   copies of ATRAC frames to be sent along with current data.  For a
   modest cost in latency and implementation complexity, error
   resiliency to packet loss can be achieved. For further details, see
   section 5.3.2.1, and reference[12].

4.5  Scalable Lossless Streaming (High-Speed Transfer mode)

   As ATRAC supports a variation on scalable encoding, this payload
   format provides a mechanism for transmitting essential data (also
   referred to as the base layer) with its enhancement data in two ways
   -- multiplexed through one session or separated over two sessions.
   In either method, only the base layer is essential in producing audio
   data.  The enhancement layer carries the remaining audio data needed
   to decode lossless audio data.  So in situations of limited
   bandwidth, the sender may choose not to transmit enhancement data yet
   still provide a client with enough data to generate lossily-encoded
   audio through the base layer.

4.5.1  Scalable Multiplexed Streaming

   In multiplexed streaming, the base layer and enhancement layer are
   coupled together in each packet, utilizing only one session as 
   illustrated in Figure 1. 
   The packet MUST begin with base layer, and the two layer types  
   MUST interleave if both of layer exist in a packet (only base or
   enhancement is included in a packet at the beginning of a streaming,
   or during the fragmentation).

   +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
   |Base|Enhancement|--|Base|Enhancement|--|Base|Enhancement| ...
   +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
           N                   N+1                 N+2        : Packet

                Figure 1. Multiplexed structure

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-24.txt        May, 2009


4.5.2  Scalable Multi-Session Streaming

   In multi-session streaming, the base layer and enhancement layer are
   sent over two separate sessions, allowing clients with certain
   bandwidth limitations to receive just the base layer for decoding as
   illustrated in Figure 2.

   In this case, it is REQUIRED to determine which sessions are paired
   together in receiver side. For paired base and enhancement layer
   session, the CNAME bindings in RTCP session MUST be applied using the
   same CNAME to ensure correct mapping to the RTP source.
  
   While there may be alternative methods for synchronization of the
   layers, the timestamp SHOULD be used for synchronizing the base layer
   with its enhancement. The two sessions MUST be synchronized 
   using the information in RTCP SR packets to align the RTP timestamps.

   If the enhancement layer's session data cannot arrive until 
   the presentation time, the decoder MUST decode the Base layer 
   session's data only, ignoring the enhancement layer's data. 


   Session 1:
   +------+  +------+  +------+  +------+
   | Base |--| Base |--| Base |--| Base | ...
   +------+  +------+  +------+  +------+
      N         N+1       N+2       N+3     : Packet


   Session 2:
   +-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
   | Enhancement |--| Enhancement |--| Enhancement | ...
   +-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
         N                N+1              N+2         : Packet

5.  Payload Format

5.1  Global Structure of Payload Format

   The structure of ATRAC Payload is illustrated in Figure 3.
   The RTP payload following the RTP header contains two
   octet-aligned data sections.


   +------+--------------+-----------------------------+
   |RTP   | ATRAC Header |   ATRAC Frames Section      |
   |Header| Section      | (including redundant data)  |
   +------+--------------+-----------------------------+
   < ---------------- RTP Packet Payload ------------- >

     Figure 3. Structure of RTP Payload of ATRAC family

   The first data section is the ATRAC Header, containing just one
   header with information for the whole packet. The second
   section is where the encoded ATRAC frames are stored.  This may
   contain either a single fragment of one ATRAC frame, or one or more
   complete ATRAC frames. The ATRAC Frames Section MUST NOT be empty.
   When using the redundancy mechanism described in section 5.3.2.1, the
   redundant frame data can be included in this section and time stamp 
   MUST be set to the oldest redundant frame's time stamp.

   To benefit from ATRAC's High-Speed Transfer mode lossless encoding
   capability, the RTP payload can be split across two sessions, with
   one transmitting an essential base layer and the other transmitting
   enhancement data.  However in either case, the above structure still
   applies.

   The structure of RTP Standard Header Part is illustrated in Figure 4.

   Version(V): 2 bits
   Set to 2.

   Padding(P): 1 bit
   If the padding bit is set, the packet contains one or more
   additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the
   payload.  The last octet of the padding contains a count of how
   many padding octets should be ignored, including itself.  Padding
   may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes
   or for carrying several RTP packets in a lower-layer protocol data
   unit (see [1]). 

   Extension(X): 1 bit
   Defined by the RTP profile used.

   CSRC count(CC): 4bits
   see RFC 3550[1].

   Marker (M): 1 bit
   Set to 1 if the packet is the first packet after a silence period,
   otherwise it MUST be set to 0. 

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits
   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is
   outside the scope of this document; it is specified by the RTP
   profile under which this payload format is used, or signaled
   dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-24.txt        May, 2009


   sequence number: 16bits
   A sequential number for RTP packet. It ranges from 0 to 65535 and
   repeats itself periodically.

   Timestamp: 32 bits
   A timestamp representing the sampling time of the first sample of 
   the first ATRAC frame in the current RTP packet.  
   When using SDP, the clock rate of the RTP timestamp MUST be 
   expressed using the "rtpmap" attribute. 
   For ATRAC3 and ATRAC Advanced Lossless, the RTP timestamp rate
   MUST be 44100Hz.  For ATRAC-X the RTP timestamp rate is 44100Hz or 
   48000Hz, and it will be selected by out-of-band signaling.

   SSRC: 32bits
   see RFC 3550[1].
   
   CSRC list: 0 to 15 items, 32bits each
   see RFC 3550[1].

5.3 RTP Payload Structure

5.3.1 Usage of ATRAC Header Section

   The ATRAC header section has the fixed length of one byte as 
   illustrated in Figure 5.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |C|FrgNo|NFrames|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   Figure 5. ATRAC RTP Header

   Continuation Flag (C) : 1bit
   The packet which corresponds to the last part of the audio frame data
   in a fragmentation, MUST have this bit to 0, otherwise set to 1.

   Fragment Number (FrgNo): 3 bits
   In the event of data fragmentation, this value is one for the first
   packet, and increases sequentially for the remaining fragmented data
   packets. This value MUST be zero for an unfragmented frame. (Note:
   3 bits is sufficient to avoid Fragment Number rollover given the
   current maximum supported bit-rate in the ATRAC specification.  If
   that changes, the choice of 3 bits for the Fragment Number should be
   revisited.)

   Number of Frames (NFrames): 4 bits
   The number of audio frames in this packet are field value + 1. 
   This allows for a maximum of 16 ATRAC-encoded audio frames per 
   packet, with 0 indicating one audio frame. Each audio frame MUST be 
   complete in the packet if fragmentation is not applied. In case of
   fragmentation, the data for only one audio frame is allowed to be 
   fragmented, and this value MUST be 0.

5.3.2  Usage of ATRAC Frames Section

   The ATRAC Frames Section contains an integer number of complete
   ATRAC frames or a single fragment of one ATRAC frame as 
   illustrated in Figure 6. Each ATRAC frame is preceded by a one-bit 
   flag indicating the layer type and a Block Length field indicating 
   the size in bytes of the ATRAC frame. If more than one ATRAC frame 
   is present, then the frames are concatenated into a contiguous 
   string of bit-flag, Block Length, and ATRAC frame in order of their
   frame number. This section MUST NOT be empty.

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
             Figure 6. ATRAC Frame Section Format

   Layer Type Flag (E): 1 bit
   Set to 1 if the corresponding ATRAC frame is from an enhancement
   layer. 0 indicates a base layer encoded frame.

   Block length: 15 bits
   The byte length of encoded audio data for the following frame. This
   is so that in the case of fragmentation, if only a subsequent packet
   is received, decoding can still occur. 15 bits allows for a maximum

5.3.2.1 Support of redundancy

   This payload format provides a rudimentary scheme to compensate 
   for occasional packet loss. As every packet's timestamp corresponds
   to the first audio frame regardless of whether it is redundant or
   not, and because we know how many frames of audio each packet 
   encapsulates, if two successive packets are successfully transmitted,
   we can calculate the number of redundant frames being sent.  The
   result gives the client a sense of how the server is responding to
   RTCP reports and warns it to expand its buffer size if necessary.
   As an example of using the Redundant Data, refer to Figure 7 and 8.

   In this example, the server has determined that for the next few
   number of packets, it should send the last two frames from the
   previous packet due to recent RTCP reports.  Thus, between packets 
   N and N+1, there is a redundancy of two frames (which the client 
   may choose to dispose of).  The benefit arises when packets N+2 
   and N+3 do not arrive at all, after which eventually packet N+4 
   arrives with successive necessary audio frame data.

5.3.2.2  Frame Fragmentation

   Each RTP packet MUST contain either an integer number of ATRAC
   encoded audio frames (with a maximum of 16), or one ATRAC frame
   fragment.  In the former case, as many complete ATRAC frames as can
   fit in a single path-MTU SHOULD be placed in an RTP packet.  However,
   if even a single ATRAC frame will not fit into a complete RTP packet,
   the ATRAC frame MUST be fragmented.

   The start of a fragmented frame gets placed in its own RTP packet
   with its Continuation bit (C) set to one, and its Fragment Number
   (FragNo) set to one.  As the frame must be the only one in the 
   packet, the Number of Frames field is zero.  Subsequent packets are 
   to contain the remaining fragmented frame data, with the Fragment 
   Number increasing sequentially and the Continuation bit (C) 
   consistently set to one. As subsequent packets do not contain any new
   frames, the Number of Frames field MUST be ignored. The last packet
   of fragmented data MUST have the Continuation bit (C) set to zero.

   Packets containing related fragmented frames MUST have identical
   timestamps. Thus, while the Continuous bit and Fragment Number fields
   indicate fragmentation and a means to reorder the packets, the
   timestamp can be used to determine which packets go together."

7.  Payload Format Parameters

   Certain parameters will need to be defined before ATRAC family
   encoded content can be streamed.  Other optional parameters may also
   be defined to take advantage of specific features relevant to certain
   ATRAC versions.  Parameters for ATRAC3, ATRAC-X, and ATRAC Advanced
   Lossless are defined here as part of the media subtype registration
   process.  A mapping of these parameters into the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) (RFC 4566) [2] is also provided for applications that
   utilize SDP. These registrations use the template defined in RFC 
   4288 [5] and follow RFC 4855 [6].

   The data format and parameters are specified for real-time transport
   in RTP.

7.1  ATRAC3 Media type Registration

   The media subtype for the Adaptive TRansform Codec version 3 (ATRAC3)
   uses the template defined in RFC 4855 [6].

   Note, any unknown parameter MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Type name:  audio

   Subtype name:  atrac3

   Required parameters:
   rate:  Represents the sampling frequency in Hz of the original
   audio data.  Permissible value is 44100 only.

   baseLayer:  Indicates the encoded bit-rate in kbps for the audio 
   data to be streamed.  Permissible values are 66, 105 and 132.

   Optional parameters:

   ptime: see RFC4566[2]

   maxptime: see RFC4566[2]
   The frame length of ATRAC3 is 1024/44100 = 23.22...(ms), and
   fractional value may not be applicable for the SDP definition. 
   So the the value of the parameter MUST be a multiple of 24(ms)
   considering safe transmission.
   If this parameter is not present, the sender MAY encapsulate 
   a maximum of 6 encoded frames into one RTP packet, in streaming 
   of ATRAC3.

   maxRedundantFrames:  The maximum number of redundant frames that may
   be sent during a session in any given packet under the redundant
   framing mechanism detailed in the draft.  Allowed values are integers
   in the range of 0 to 15, inclusive.  If this parameter is not used, a
   default of 15 MUST be assumed. 

   Encoding considerations:  This media type is framed and contains 
   binary data.

   Security considerations:  This media type does not carry active
   content. See Section 9 of this document.

   Interoperability considerations: none

7.2  ATRAC-X Media type Registration

   The media subtype for the Adaptive TRansform Codec version X 
   (ATRAC-X) uses the template defined in RFC 4855 [6].

   Note, any unknown parameter MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Type name:  audio

   Subtype name:  atrac-x

   Required parameters:
   rate:  Represents the sampling frequency in Hz of the original
   audio data.  Permissible values are 44100 and 48000.

   baseLayer:  Indicates the encoded bit-rate in kbps for the audio 
   data to be streamed.  Permissible values are 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 
   160, 192, 256, 320 and 352.

   channelID:  Indicates the number of channels and channel layout
   according to the table1 in Section 7.4.  Note that this layout is
   different from that proposed in RFC 3551 [3].  However, as 
   channelID = 0 defines an ambiguous channel layout, the channel 
   mapping defined in Section 4.1 of [3] could be used. Permissible 
   values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

   Optional parameters:

   ptime:    see RFC4566[2]

   maxptime: see RFC4566[2]
   The frame length of ATRAC-X is 2048/44100 = 46.44...(ms) or 
   2048/48000 = 42.67...(ms), but fractional value may not be applicable
   for the SDP definition. So the value of the parameter MUST be a 
   multiple of 47(ms) or 43(ms) considering safe transmission.

   of ATRAC-X.

   maxRedundantFrames:  The maximum number of redundant frames that 
   may be sent during a session in any given packet under the redundant
   framing mechanism detailed in the draft. Allowed values are integers
   in the range 0 to 15, inclusive.  If this parameter is not used, a
   default of 15 MUST be assumed.

   delayMode:  Indicates a desire to use low-delay features, in which
   case the decoder will process received data accordingly based on 
   this value. Permissible values are 2 and 4.

7.3  ATRAC Advanced Lossless Media type Registration

   The media subtype for the Adaptive TRansform Codec Lossless version
   (ATRAC Advanced Lossless) uses the template defined in RFC 4855 [6].

   Note, any unknown parameter MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Type name:  audio

   Subtype name:  atrac-advanced-lossless

   Required parameters:
   rate:  Represents the sampling frequency in Hz of the original
   audio data.  Permissible value is 44100 only for High-speed transfer
   mode. Any value of 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000, 64000, 88200,
   96000, 176400 and 192000 can be used for Standard mode.

   baseLayer:  Indicates the encoded bit-rate in kbps for the base 
   layer in High-Speed Transfer mode lossless encodings.  
   For Standard lossless mode this value MUST be 0.
   The Permissible values for ATRAC3 baselayer are 66, 105 and 132.
   For ATRAC-X baselayer, they are 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 
   320 and 352.
  
   blockLength: Indicates the block length. In High-speed Transfer 
   mode, the value of 1024 and 2048 is used for ATRAC3 and ATRAC-X 
   based ATRAC Advanced Lossless streaming, respectively.
   Any value of 512, 1024 and 2048 can be used for Standard mode.

   channelID:  Indicates the number of channels and channel layout
   according to the table1 in Section 7.4.  Note that this layout is
   different from that proposed in RFC 3551 [3]. However, as channelID
   = 0 defines an ambiguous channel layout, the channel mapping defined
   in Section 4.1 of [3] could be used in this case. Permissible values
   are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

   ptime:    see RFC4566[2]

   maxptime: see RFC4566[2]
   In streaming of ATRAC Advanced Lossless, multiple frames cannot be 
   transmitted in a single RTP packet, as the frame size is large. 
   So it SHOULD be regarded as the time of one encoded frame in both of 
   the sender and the receiver side. The frame length of ATRAC Advanced
   Lossless is 512/44100 = 11.6...(ms), 1024/44100 = 23.22...(ms) or
   2048/44100 = 46.44...(ms), but fractional value may not be applicable
   for the SDP definition. So the the value of the parameter MUST be 
   12(ms), 24(ms) or 47(ms) considering safe transmission.

   Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and contains 
   binary data.

   content. See Section 9 of this document.

   Interoperability considerations: none
   Published specification: 
        ATRAC Advanced Lossless Standard Specification[11] 

   Applications that use this media type:

7.5  Mapping Media type Parameters into SDP

   The information carried in the Media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [2], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the ATRAC family of codecs, the
   following mapping rules according to the ATRAC codec apply:

7.5.1  For Media subtype ATRAC3

   o  The Media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name

   o  The Media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  ATRAC3 supports only mono or stereo signals,
      so a corresponding number of channels(0 or 1) MUST also be 
      specified in this attribute.

   o  The "baseLayer" parameter goes in SDP "a=fmtp".  This parameter
      MUST be present. "maxRedundantFrames" may follow, but if no value
      is transmitted, the receiver SHOULD assume a default value of
      "15".

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

7.5.2  For Media subtype ATRAC-X

   o  The Media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name

   o  The Media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  This SHOULD be followed by the "sampleRate"
      (as the RTP clock rate), and then the actual number of channels
      regardless of the channelID parameter.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the Media type string as a
      semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.  The
      "baseLayer" parameter MUST be the first entry on this line.  
      The "channelID" parameter MUST be the next entry. The receiver 
      MUST assume a default value of "15" for "maxRedundantFrames".

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-24.txt        May, 2009


7.5.3  For Media subtype ATRAC Advanced Lossless

   o  The Media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name

   o  The Media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  This MUST be followed by the "sampleRate"
      (as the RTP clock rate), and then the actual number of channels
      regardless of the channelID parameter.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the Media type string as a
      semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs. 
      On this line, the parameters "baseLayer" and "blockLength" 
      MUST be present in this order.
      The value of "blockLength" MUST be one of 1024 and 2048, for
      using ATRAC3 and ATRAC-X as baselayer, respectively.
      If "baseLayer=0" (means standard mode), "blockLength" MUST be one
      of either 512, 1024, or 2048. The "channelID" parameter MUST be 
      the next entry .  The receiver MUST assume a default value of "15"
      for "maxRedundantFrames".

7.6  Offer-Answer Model Considerations

   Some options for encoding and decoding ATRAC audio data will require
   either or both of the sender and receiver to comply with certain
   specifications.  In order to establish an interoperable transmission
   framework, an Offer-Answer negotiation in SDP MUST observe the
   following considerations. (See reference [14].):

7.6.1  For All Three Media Subtypes

   o  Each combination of the RTP payload transport format configuration
      parameters (baseLayer and blockLength, sampleRate, channelID) is
      unique in its bit-pattern and not compatible with any other
      combination.  When creating an offer in an application desiring to
      use the more advanced features (sample rates above 44100kHz, more
      than two channels), the offerer SHOULD also offer a payload type
      containing only the lowest set of necessary requirements.
      If multiple configurations are of interest to the application 
      they may all be offered.

   o  The parameters "maxptime" and "ptime" will in most cases not
      affect interoperability, however the setting of the parameters can
      affect the performance of the application.  The SDP offer-answer
      handling of the "ptime" parameter is described in RFC3264.  
      The "maxptime" parameter MUST be handled in the same way.

7.6.2  For Media subtype ATRAC3

   o  In response to an offer, downgraded subsets of "baseLayer" are
      possible.  However for best performance, we suggest the answer
      contain the highest possible values offered.






















Hatanaka, et al.                                               [Page 26]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-24.txt        May, 2009


7.6.3  For Media subtype ATRAC-X

   o  In response to an offer, downgraded subsets of "sampleRate",
      "baseLayer", and "channelID" are possible. For best performance,
      an answer MUST NOT contain any values requiring further 
      capabilities than the offer contains, but it SHOULD provide values
      as close as possible to those in the offer.

   o  The "maxRedundantFrames" is a suggested minimum.  This value MAY
      be increased in an answer (with a maximum of 15), but MUST NOT be
      reduced.

   o  The optional parameter "delayMode" is non-negotiable.  If the
      Answerer cannot comply with the offered value, the session MUST be
      deemed inoperable.

7.6.4  For Media subtype ATRAC Advanced Lossless

   o  In response to an offer, downgraded subsets of "sampleRate",
      "baseLayer", and "channelID" are possible.  For best performance,
      an answer MUST NOT contain any values requiring further 
      capabilities than the offer contains, but it SHOULD provide values
      as close as possible to those in the offer.

   o  There are no requirements when negotiating "blockLength", other
      than that both parties must be in agreement.

   o  The "maxRedundantFrames" is a suggested minimum.  This value MAY
      be increased in an answer (with a maximum of 15), but MUST NOT be
      reduced.

   o  For transmission of scalable multi-session streaming of ATRAC 
      Advanced Lossless content, the attributes of media stream 
      identification, group information and decoding dependency between
      base layer stream and enhancement layer stream MUST be signaled
      in SDP by offer/answer model. In this case, the attribute of 
      "group", "mid" and "depend" followed by appropriate parameter MUST
      be used in SDP[7][8] in order to indicate layered coding 
      dependency. The attribute of "group" followed by "DDP" parameter
      is used for indicating relationship between the base and the 
      enhancement layer stream with decoding dependency. Each stream is
      identified by "mid" attribute, and the dependency of enhancement 
      layer stream is defined by "depend" attribute, as the enhancement
      layer is only useful when the base layer is available. Examples
      for signaling ATRAC Advanced Lossless decoding dependency are 
      described in section 7.8 and 7.9.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-24.txt        May, 2009


7.7  Usage of declarative SDP

   In declarative usage, like SDP in RTSP [15] or SAP [16], the
   parameters MUST be interpreted as follows:

   o  The payload format configuration parameters (baseLayer,
      sampleRate, channelID) are all declarative and a participant MUST
      use the configuration(s) provided for the session. More than one 
      configuration may be provided if necessary by declaring multiple
      RTP payload types, however the number of types SHOULD be kept 
      small.

   o  Any "maxptime" and "ptime" values SHOULD be selected with care to
      ensure that the session's participants can achieve reasonable
      performance.

   o  The attribute of "mid", "group" and "depend" MUST be used for
      indicating relationship and dependency of the base layer and 
      the enhancement layer in scalable multi-session streaming of ATRAC
      ADVANCED LOSSLESS content, as described in 7.6, 7.8 and 7.9.

7.9  Example Offer-Answer Exchange

   The following Offer/Answer example shows how a desire to stream
   multi-channel content is turned down by the receiver, who answers
   with only the ability to receive stereo content:

   Offer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 98 99
   a=rtpmap:98 ATRAC-X/44100/6
   a=fmtp:98 baseLayer=320; channelID=5
   a=rtpmap:99 ATRAC-X/44100/2
   a=fmtp:99 baseLayer=160; channelID=2

   Answer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 99
   a=rtpmap:99 ATRAC-X/44100/2
   a=fmtp:99 baseLayer=160; channelID=2

   The following Offer/Answer example shows the receiver answering with
   a selection of supported parameters:

   Offer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97 98 99
   a=rtpmap:97 ATRAC-X/44100/2
   a=fmtp:97 baseLayer=128; channelID=2
   a=rtpmap:98 ATRAC-X/44100/6
   a=fmtp:98 baseLayer=128; channelID=5
   a=rtpmap:99 ATRAC-X/48000/6
   a=fmtp:99 baseLayer=320; channelID=5

   Answer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97 98
   a=rtpmap:97 ATRAC-X/44100/2
   a=fmtp:97 baseLayer=128; channelID=2
   a=rtpmap:98 ATRAC-X/44100/6
   a=fmtp:98 baseLayer=128; channelID=5

   The following Offer/Answer example shows an exchange in trying to
   resolve using ATRAC-Advanced-Lossless.  The offer contains three
   options: multi-session High-Speed Transfer mode, multiplexed High-
   Speed Transfer mode, and Standard mode.

   Note that payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in 
   upper case.  Media subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.  
   These names are case-insensitive in both places.  Similarly, 
   parameter names are case-insensitive both in Media types and in 
   the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Three new Media subtypes, for audio/ATRAC3, audio/ATRAC-X, 
   audio/ATRAC-ADVANCED-LOSSLESS are requested to be registered 
   (see Section 7).

9.  Security Considerations

   The payload format as described in this document is subject to the
   security considerations defined in RFC3550 [1] and any applicable
   profile, for example RFC 3551 [3]. Also the security of media type
   registration MUST be taken into account as described in section 5 of
   RFC 4855[6]. 

   The payload for ATRAC family consists solely of compressed audio 
   data to be decoded and presented as sound, and the standard 
   specifications of ATRAC3, ATRAC-X and ATRAC Advanced Lossless[9][10]
   [11] strictly define the bit stream syntax and the buffer model in
   decoder side for each codec. So they can not carry "active content"
   that could impose malicious side-effects upon the receiver, and 
   they does not cause any problem of illegal resource consumption in 
   receiver side, as far as the bit streams are conforming to their
   standard specifications.

   This payload format does not implement any security mechanisms of 
   its own. Confidentiality, integrity protection, and authentication
   have to be provided by a mechanism external to this payload format,
   e.g., SRTP RFC3711[13].

10. Considerations on Correct Decoding

10.1 Verification of the Packets

   Verification of the received encoded audio packets MUST be performed 
   so as to ensure correct decoding of the packets. As a most primitive 
   implementation, the comparison of the packet size and payload length 
   can be taken into account. If the UDP packet length is longer than 
   the RTP packet length, the packet can be accepted, but the extra
   bytes MUST be ignored. In case of receiving shorter UDP packet or
   improperly encoded packets, the packets MUST be discarded.

10.2 Validity Checking of the Packets

   Also validity checking of the received audio packets MUST be 
   performed. It can be carried out by decoding process, as ATRAC 
   format is designed so that the validity of data frames can be 
   determined by decoding algorithm. The required decoder response to 
   a malformed frame is to discard the malformed data and conceal the 
   errors in the audio output until a valid frame is detected and 
   decoded. This is expected to prevent crashes and other abnormal 
   decoder behavior in response to errors or attacks.
