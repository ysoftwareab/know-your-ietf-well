Abstract

This document describes a single way to perform both Mobile-IPv4  
and 802.11  authentication and key exchanges. Diameter Mobile-IPv4
Application can be used to consumate message sequences for both
802.11 and Mobile IPv4. If 802.11 pre-authentication is not done 
then it is possible to replace the currently proposed 802.1x 
Authentication/key-exchange with  Diameter Mobile-IPv4 Application.


1.  Overview and Rationale

In the 802.11 wireless lan [WiFi] network an 802.11 client connects to an
802.11 Access Point (AP) at the link layer. 802.11 provides a mechanism to 
achieve handoffs between AP's and the client. A 802.11 client first 
authenticates and then associates with one AP. When the 802.11 client 
decides that it is better to move to a second AP, it can do a  
re-association  with the second AP. 

Similarly when a Mobile-IPv4 (MIP4) client moves from subnet to subnet, it
seeks a Foreign Agent (FA) situated in the subnet and registers with the FA. 
The IP packet sent in Registration Message has the Home IP address as the 
source, and the  destination address can be the FA's IP address or the "All 
Mobility Agents" multicast address 224.0.0.11.  The FA then responds with 
Registration Reply message. The Registration Message also includes 
Authentication Extensions. A significant hurdle in deployment of MIPv4 has 
been the distributon and management of the security association between MN-HA,
FA-HA, and MN-FA.  Recently a method, Diameter Mobile IP v4 Application 
(DIMPA), has been suggested by which all these 3 different keys can be 
generated dynamically from a single shared secret between the MN and a 
AAA agent [DIMPA]. This DIMPA provides in addition to its core 
accounting functionality.

As mentioned in a previous draft [SIMIP], there is substantial overlap 
between  what 802.11 and MIPv4 do during their respective registration 
phases. As pointed out in that draft it is possile to nest these operations 
and thus reduce the number of messages that need to be exchnaged between 
the MN and the infrastructre.  The same issues of overlapping work between 
the 802.11i authentication phase and DIMPA registration arises. 

The situation of non co-located FA is primarily considered here, although a 
discussion of co-located FA is also provided. Here we will only 
consider 802.11 infrastructure mode networks. 

2. 802.11 Network Architecture.

A hypothetical IP over 802.11 network is shown in the following figure. 
The mobile client, MN, can move from subnet X1 to X3 and from AP2 to AP3. 

			[FA1]-[AAAF1]
 			  |        
	...	[AP1]-------[X1]-|
[MN]...       	  |		|	
		[AP2]----		|----[X]----->  [HA]---[AAAH]
 					|	
		[AP3/FA3]---[X3]-|
                     |
                   [AAAF3]

[MN] - Mobile Node
[FA] - Foreign Agent
[HA] - Home Agent
[AAAH/F] - Home/Foreign AAA Agent
[AP] - Access Point
[X]  - IP Router
...  - 802.11 link 
---  - 802.3  link

					Figure 1: 802.11 Network with AAA Agents

When the MN moves from AP1 to AP2, it first Authenticates with AP2 and then 
Dissociates with AP1 at the 802.11 link layer.  As the move from AP1 to AP2 
occurs within the same subnet, hence the MN is still served by the same FA 
and the same AAAF. When the MN moves from AP2 to AP3  it is served by a 
different set of FA and AAAF, FA3 and AAAF3 respectively.

3.  Message Sequence

The following figure  shows the what happens when MN  moves from AP2 to 
AP3. During the AP1 to AP2 handoff, the MN is in same subnet, hence  MIPv4 
registration is not required, although 802.1x key-exchange is required.
Figure 2 depits the messages exchanged between the MN and the infrastructure.
Here the AAAF is assumed  to be  a RADIUS entity in addition to being a 
DIAMETER [DIM] entity.  This particular figure depicts the situation
when 802.11 pre-authentication is not done. 

We will first consider the scenario when 802.11 pre-authentication is 
not done [WiFiTGi]. Then we will discuss the scenario with 
pre-authentication.

4. No 802.11 Pre-authentication

On the surface it looks like the 802.1x based authentication/key-exchange 
and  DMIPA share a number of common messages.   Both message sequences 
do authentication of the MN first and then do key exchanges.  So it should
be possible to combine both of them into a single message sequence. In a 
previous draft [SIMIP], it was suggested MIPv4 registration messages can be 
carried as Information Elements (IE) in 802.11 Association/Reassociation frames.  
Here the same IE's can be used. DIMPA provides an Attribute Value Pair (AVP) 
called the MIP-MN-AAA-Auth AVP, which identifies the MN's security association
with the Home AAA agent (AAAH). The MIP-MN-AAA-Auth AVP is constructed
from the MIPv4 Registration Request containing the  Mobile IP Authentication 
extension with the MN-AAA Authentication subtype [MIPCR,DMIPA]. DIMPA constructs
all the MIPv4 keys and distribute them.  So it is a simple incremental task for
DIMPA to generate one more key (RC4 40 or 104 bit for TKIP [WiFiTGi]) to share 
between MN an AP. The following figure, Figure 3., shows a message sequence 
for using DIMPA for both 802.11 and MIPv4 authentication and key-exchange.

To be added.

6. New IE, AVP, Mobile IP Extensions

6.1 New Information Elements in 802.11 Management Frames

No new IE is required except those mentioned in [SIMIP]. 

6.2 New Diameter AVP's

A new Diameter AVP is defined for the AP-to-MN key, MIP-AP-to-MN Key. 


6.3 Mobile IP Extensions 

No new Mobiel IP Extension is required, but a new sub-type, MN-AP 
Authentication sub-type is defined.
 
7. Mobile Entity Implications

There are some implications for the different mobile entities involved.

7.1 Implications for MN

The MN should be capable of passing the MIPv4 information to the 802.11 
driver and vice-versa. At the instant the MN is ready to send an 
Association Request it should be able to access the MN's Mobile-IPv4 
attributes. Similarly, when the MN receives an Association Response there
should be a mechanism to change the Mobile-IPv4 attributes in MN. 

7.2 Implications for 802.11 AP

The 802.11 AP should be able to extract/include the MIPv4-802.11 IE's. 

7.3 Implications for FA

To be added

7.4 Implications for AAAH

To be added

7.5 Implications for AAAF

To be added

8. Co-located FA

To be added.

9. Miscellanious
