1.  Introduction

   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs) have been specified in
   [RFC8520].  As the RFC states, the goal of MUD is to provide a means
   for end devices to signal to the network what sort of access and
   network functionality they require to properly function.

   Schemes that rely on connectivity to bootstrap the network might be
   flaky if that connectivity is not present, potentially preventing the
   device from working correctly in the absence of Internet
   connectivity.  Moreover, even in environments that do provide
   connectivity it is unclear how continued operation can occur when the
   manufacturer's server is no longer available.

   While [RFC8520] contemplates the use of CoAP [RFC7252] in the form of
   CoAP URLs, it does not explain how MUDs can be used in a CoAP
   network.  Moreover, in CoAP the MUD file can be hosted on the CoAP
   endpoint itself, instead of hosting it on a dedicated MUD File
   Server.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  MUD Architecture

   MUDs are defined in [RFC8520] and are composed of:

   o  A URL that can be used to locate a description;

   o  the description itself, including how it is interpreted; and

   o  a means for local network management systems to retrieve the
      description;

   o  which is retrieved from a MUD File Server.

   In a MUD scenario, the end device is a "Thing" that exposes a "MUD
   URL" to the network.  Routers or Switches in the path that speak MUD
   can forward the URL to "MUD Managers" that query a "MUD file server"
   and retrieve the "MUD File" from it.  After processing, the "MUD
   Manager" applies an access policy to the IoT Thing.

                    Figure 1: Current MUD Architecture

   The general operation consists on a Thing emitting the MUD as a URL
   using DHCP, LLDP or through 802.1X, then a Switch or Router will send

   the URI to some IoT Controlling Entity.  That Entity will fetch the
   MUD file from a Server on the Internet over HTTP.

   MUDs can be used to mitigate DDOS attacks to and from devices, for
   example by prohibiting unauthorized traffic to and from IoT devices.
   MUD also prevents devices from becoming the attacker, as that would
   require the device to send traffic to an unauthorized destination.
   Overall MUDs can be used to automatically permit the device to send
   and receive only the traffic it requires to perform its intended
   function.

   This is indeed an important subject as trustworthy IoT operations is
   a recurring topic in the IETF [RFC8576].

2.1.  Problems

   The biggest issue with this architecture is that if the MUD File
   server is not available at a given time, no Thing can actually join
   the network.  Relying on a single server is generally not a good
   idea.  The DNS name may point to a load balancer group, but then that
   would require added infrastructure and complexity.

   Another potential issue is that MUD files seem to be oriented to
   classes of devices and not specific device instances.  It could be
   that during bootstrapping or provisioning different devices of the
   same class have different properties and thus different MUD files,
   more granularity would be preferable.  This could be achieved by
   creating per-device MUD files on the server, but that mechanism does
   not seem to have been currently specified.

   This brings us to the third problem, which is that the MUD file is
   somewhat static on a web server and out of the usual interaction
   patterns towards a device.  In CoAP properties that are intrinsic to
   a device (e.g. sensing information) or configuration information
   (e.g. lwm2m objects used for management) are hosted by the device
   too, even if they could be replicated by a cloud server.

3.  MUD architecture using CoAP

   [RFC8520] allows a Thing to use the CoAP protocol scheme on the MUD
   URL.  In this document we modify slightly the architecture.  The
   components are:

   o  A URL using the "coaps://" scheme that can be used to locate a
      description;

   o  the description itself, including how it is interpreted, which is
      now hosted and linked from "/.well-known/core" and

   o  a means for local network management systems to retrieve the MUD
      description

   o  which is hosted by the Thing itself acting as CoAP MUD File
      Server.

                  Figure 2: Self-hosted MUD Architecture

3.1.  Problems

   This design has some problems of its own.  The main being that, if
   DHCP is restricted in the network, the device may not be able to
   advertise a functional MUD URL ([RFC8520] Section 1.9).

4.  Finding a policy: MUD URL advertisement

   A CoAP endpoint will emit a URL that uses the CoAP scheme [RFC7252].
   This URL serves both to classify the device type and to provide a
   means to locate a policy file, as specified on [RFC8520].

4.1.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

   [RFC8520] specifies a new MUD URL DHCP Option that carries the MUD
   URL to the DHCP Server.  The functioning is the same as specified on
   [RFC8520].

   If the DHCP Server cannot provide a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address, the
   device may use a temporary IPv6 link-local address as base URI (e.g.
   "coaps://[FE80::AB8]/mud/light-class").  As link local is not a

   globally addressable address, the MUD Manager will only be able to
   reach the device if it is in the same network as the device.

   TBD : IPv4, coap://, ...

4.2.  Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

   IPv6 hosts do not require DHCP to get access to the default gateway.
   [RFC4861] can also be used to advertise the MUD URL.

   TBD : Figure out how these work - Neighbor Solicitation (type 135) -
   Neighbor Advertisement (type 136) - Redirect (type 137)

4.2.1.  NDP on 6LoWPANs

   LoWPANs are characterized as lossy, low-power, low-bit-rate, short-
   range; with many nodes saving energy with long sleep periods.  For
   that reason vanilla NDP [RFC4861] might not be the most desiderable
   solution in such networks and optimizations like the ones provided by
   [RFC6775] are required.

   TBD : Figure out how these work

4.3.  Stateless autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

   [RFC4862] specifies how to create and auto configure link-local
   addresses during system startup.

   TBD : Figure out how these work

5.  CoAP Operations

   Things can expose MUDs as any other resource.  MUD Managers can send
   a GET requests to a CoAP server for "/.well-known/core" and get in
   return a list of hypermedia links to other resources hosted in that
   server.  Among those, it will get the path to the MUD file, for
   example "/mud" and Resource Types like "rt=mud".

5.1.  Discovery

5.1.1.  Resource Directory

   By using [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], devices can register a
   MUD file on the Resource Directory and use it as a MUD repository
   too.  Making it discoverable with the usual RD Lookup steps.

   Lookup will use the resource type "rt=mud", the example in Link-
   Format [RFC6690] is:

   The same example in CoRAL ([I-D.ietf-core-coral],

        rd-item <coap://[2001:db8:3::102]/mud/lock> { rt "mud" }
        rd-item <coap://[2001:db8:3::103]/mud/light> { rt "mud" }

5.1.2.  Multicast

   [RFC7252] registers one IPv4 and one IPv6 address each for the
   purpose of CoAP multicast.  All CoAP Nodes can be addressed at
   "224.0.1.187" and at "FF0X::FD".  Multicast could also be used to
   discover all Manufacturer descriptions in a subnet.

   The example in Link-Format [RFC6690] is:

   GET coap://[FF0X::FE]/.well-known/core?rt=mud

   The same example in CoRAL ([I-D.ietf-core-coral],
   [I-D.hartke-t2trg-coral-reef]) is:

   REQ: GET coap://[FF0X::FE]/.well-known/core?rt=mud

5.1.3.  Direct MUD discovery

   Using [RFC6690] using CoRE Link Format, a CoAP endpoint could attempt
   to configure itself based on another Thing's MUD.  For that reason it
   might fetch directly the MUD file from the device.  It would start by
   finding if the endpoint has a MUD.  The example in Link-Format
   [RFC6690] is:

   REQ: GET coap://[2001:db8:3::123]:5683/.well-known/core?rt=mud

   RES: 2.05 Content

        </mud/light>;rt=mud

   In CoRAL ([I-D.ietf-core-coral], [I-D.hartke-t2trg-coral-reef]):

   REQ: GET coap://[2001:db8:3::123]:5683/.well-known/core?rt=mud
        Accept: TBD123456 (application/coral+cbor@identity)

   RES: 2.05 Content
        Content-Format: TBD123456 (application/coral+cbor@identity)

        rd-item </mud/light> { rt "mud" }

   Once the client knows that there is a MUD file under "/mud/lightmud",
   it can decide to follow the presented links and query it.

   REQ: GET coap://[2001:db8:3::123]:5683/mud/light
   RES: 2.05 Content

        [{MUD Payload in SENML}]

   In CoRAL ([I-D.ietf-core-coral], [I-D.hartke-t2trg-coral-reef]):

   REQ: GET coap://[2001:db8:3::123]:5683/mud/light

   RES: 2.05 Content

        [{MUD Payload in SENML}]

   The device may also observe the MUD resource using [RFC7641],
   directly subscribing to future network configuration changes.

6.  MUD File

   TBD.  Behaviors that are specific of CoAP should be here.

6.1.  Serialization

   TBD.  Write about SenML/CBOR MUDs.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

   Things will expose a MUD file that has to be be signed both by the
   MUD author and by the device operator.  Security Considerations
   present on Section 4.1 of [RFC8576].

   We might want to use BRSKI or another similar mechanism.

   Optionally the device could advertise localhost on the URL with the
   path to the MUD.  When the network has the IP it'd append the path to
   it in order to fetch the MUD.

   If the host part is always dynamically computed how are bootstrap /
   attachment schemes that depend on certs (EAP) work?

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: rt=mud should be registered.
