 Deprecation of MIB Module NAT-MIB (Managed Objects for Network Address
                           Translators (NAT))
             draft-perrault-behave-deprecate-nat-mib-v1-06

Abstract

   This memo deprecates MIB module NAT-MIB, a portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) previously defined in RFC 4008 for devices
   implementing Network Address Translator (NAT) function.  A companion
   document defines a new version, NAT-MIB-V2, which responds to
   deficiencies found in module NAT-MIB and adds new capabilities.

   This document obsoletes RFC 4008.  All RFC 4008 MIB objects are
   included in this version unchanged with only the STATUS changed to
   deprecated.

Status of This Memo

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   RFC Editor NOTE: please replace all occurences of RFCyyyy with the
   number assigned to this document, and all occurences of RFCzzzz with
   the number assigned to [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib-v2].

   This memo deprecates a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB), MIB module NAT-MIB, for devices implementing the Network
   Address Translator (NAT) function.  New implementations are
   encouraged to base themselves upon the second version of this MIB
   module, NAT-MIB-V2, defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib-v2].  NAT
   types and their characteristics are defined in [RFC2663].
   Traditional NAT function, in particular is defined in [RFC3022].
   Neither NAT-MIB nor NAT-MIB-V2 addresses firewall functions and
   neither can be used for configuring or monitoring them.

   Section 2 provides references to the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) management framework, which was used as the basis for

   the original MIB module definition and its deprecation.  Section 3
   provides motivation for the deprecation of module NAT-MIB and its
   replacement by module NAT-MIB-V2.  Section 4 has the complete NAT-MIB
   module definition, with the STATUS of all objects changed to
   deprecated.  Section 5 describes security considerations relating to
   NAT-MIB, basically relying on the security considerations in
   [RFC4008] and [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib-v2].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].

3.  Motivation For Deprecating NAT-MIB

   This section provides the motivation for deprecating the NAT-MIB
   module and its replacement by a new version.

3.1.  Deprecated Features

   All objects defined in [RFC4008] have been marked with "STATUS
   deprecated" for the following reasons:

   Writability:  Experience with NAT has shown that implementations vary
      tremendously.  The NAT algorithms and data structures have little
      in common across devices, and this results in wildly incompatible
      configuration parameters.  Therefore, few implementations were
      ever able to claim full compliance.

      Lesson learned: the MIB should be read-only as much as possible.

   Exposing configuration parameters:  Even in read-only mode, many
      configuration parameters were exposed by [RFC4008] (e.g.
      timeouts).  Since implementations vary wildly in their sets of

Internet-Draft          Deprecation of NAT MIB v1              July 2015


      configuration parameters, few implementations could claim even
      basic compliance.

      Lesson learned: the NAT MIB's purpose is not to expose
      configuration parameters.

   Interfaces:  Objects from [RFC4008] tie NAT state with interfaces
      (e.g. the interface table, the way map entries are grouped by
      interface).  Many NAT implementations either never keep track of
      the interface or associate a mapping to a set of interfaces.
      Since interfaces are at the core of [RFC4008], many NAT devices
      were unable to have a proper implementation.

      Lesson learned: NAT is a logical function that may be independent
      of interfaces.  Do not tie NAT state with interfaces.

   NAT service types:  [RFC4008] used four categories of NAT service:
      basicNat, napt, bidirectionalNat, twiceNat.  These are ill-defined
      and many implementations either use different categories or do not
      use categories at all.

      Lesson learned: do not try to categorize NAT types.

   Limited transport protocol set:  The set of transport protocols was
      defined as: other, icmp, udp, tcp.  Furthermore, the numeric
      values corresponding to those labels were arbitrary, without
      relation to the actual standard protocol numbers.  This meant that
      NAT implementations were limited to those protocols and were
      unable to expose information about DCCP, SCTP, etc.

      Lesson learned: use standard transport protocol numbers.

3.2.  Desirable New Features

   A number of desirable new features have been identified that are not
   present in NAT-MIB.  See the latter part of
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib-v2] Section 2.

4.  Definitions

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580],
   [RFC2863], [RFC3411], and [RFC4001].  It also refers to information
   in RFCs [RFC0792], [RFC4443], and [RFC3413].

               "The end-point entity (source or destination) in
                inbound or outbound sessions (i.e., first packets) that
                may be translated by an address map entry.

                Session direction (inbound or outbound) is
                derived from the direction of the first packet
                of a session traversing a NAT interface.
                NAT address (and Transport-ID) maps may be defined
                to effect inbound or outbound sessions.

                Traditionally, address maps for Basic NAT and NAPT are
                configured on a public interface for outbound sessions,
                effecting translation of source end-point.  The value of
                this object must be set to outboundSrcEndPoint for
                those interfaces.

                Alternately, if address maps for Basic NAT and NAPT were
                to be configured on a private interface, the desired
                value for this object for the map entries
                would be inboundSrcEndPoint (i.e., effecting translation
                of source end-point for inbound sessions).

                If TwiceNAT were to be configured on a private
                interface, the desired value for this object for the map
                entries would be a bitmask of inboundSrcEndPoint and
                inboundDstEndPoint.

5.  Security Considerations

   All objects in this MIB module have been deprecated.  As a result,
   security considerations in [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib-v2] apply
   instead.  Amongst other matters, these considerations cover the case
   where both this MIB module and NAT-MIB-V2 are present.  In fact, such
   a situation is unlikely because [RFC4008], as a MIB module oriented
   toward configuration, was overtaken by events and saw little
   implementation.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned object identifier 123 to the natMIB module, with
   prefix iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2 in the Network Management
   Parameters registry [SMI-NUMBERS].

   IANA is requested to mark that identifier as DEPRECATED and to update
   the reference from [RFC4008] to the present document.
