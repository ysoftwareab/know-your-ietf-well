  Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance for DNSSEC
                  draft-ietf-dnsop-algorithm-update-06

Abstract

   The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in
   order to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non-
   existence.  To ensure interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS
   authoritative servers, it is necessary to specify a set of algorithm
   implementation requirements and usage guidelines to ensure that there
   is at least one algorithm that all implementations support.  This
   document defines the current algorithm implementation requirements
   and usage guidance for DNSSEC.  This document obsoletes [RFC6944].

1.  Introduction

   The DNSSEC signing algorithms are defined by various RFCs, including
   [RFC4034], [RFC5155], [RFC5702], [RFC5933], [RFC6605], [RFC8080].
   DNSSEC is used to provide authentication of data.  To ensure
   interoperability, a set of "mandatory-to-implement" DNSKEY algorithms
   are defined.  This document obsoletes [RFC6944].

1.1.  Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance

   The field of cryptography evolves continuously.  New stronger
   algorithms appear and existing algorithms are found to be less secure
   then originally thought.  Therefore, algorithm implementation
   requirements and usage guidance need to be updated from time to time
   to reflect the new reality.  The choices for algorithms must be
   conservative to minimize the risk of algorithm compromise.

1.2.  Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels

   The mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should already be
   available in most implementations of DNSSEC by the time it is made
   mandatory.  This document attempts to identify and introduce those
   algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement status.  There is no
   guarantee that algorithms in use today will become mandatory in the
   future.  Published algorithms are continuously subjected to
   cryptographic attack and may become too weak, or even be completely
   broken, before this document is updated.

   This document only provides recommendations with respect to
   mandatory-to-implement algorithms or algorithms so weak that
   recommendation cannot be recommended.  Any algorithm listed in the
   [DNSKEY-IANA] and [DS-IANA] registries, but not mentioned in this
   document, MAY be implemented.  For clarification and consistency, an
   algorithm will be specified as MAY in this document only when it has
   been downgraded.

   Although this document's primary purpose is to update algorithm
   recommendations to keep DNSSEC authentication secure over time, it
   also aims to do so in such a way that DNSSEC implementations remain
   interoperable.  DNSSEC interoperability is addressed by an
   incremental introduction or deprecation of algorithms.

   [RFC2119] considers the term SHOULD equivalent to RECOMMENDED, and
   SHOULD NOT equivalent to NOT RECOMMENDED.  The authors of this
   document have chosen to use the terms RECOMMENDED and NOT
   RECOMMENDED, as this more clearly expresses the recommendations to
   implementers.

   It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm will be performed
   gradually.  This provides time for various implementations to update
   their implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable.  Unless
   there are strong security reasons, an algorithm is expected to be
   downgraded from MUST to NOT RECOMMENDED or MAY, instead of to MUST
   NOT.  Similarly, an algorithm that has not been mentioned as
   mandatory-to-implement is expected to be introduced with a
   RECOMMENDED instead of a MUST.

   Since the effect of using an unknown DNSKEY algorithm is that the
   zone is treated as insecure, it is recommended that algorithms
   downgraded to NOT RECOMMENDED or lower not be used by authoritative
   nameservers and DNSSEC signers to create new DNSKEY's.  This will
   allow for deprecated algorithms to become less and less common over
   time.  Once an algorithm has reached a sufficiently low level of
   deployment, it can be marked as MUST NOT, so that recursive resolvers
   can remove support for validating it.

   Recursive nameservers are encouraged to retain support for all
   algorithms not marked as MUST NOT.

1.3.  Document Audience

   The recommendations of this document mostly target DNSSEC
   implementers, as implementations need to meet both high security
   expectations as well as high interoperability between various vendors
   and with different versions.  Interoperability requires a smooth
   transition to more secure algorithms.  This perspective may differ
   from from that of a user who wishes to deploy and configure DNSSEC
   with only the safest algorithm.  On the other hand, the comments and
   recommendations in this document are also expected to be useful for
   such users.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   RSAMD5 is not widely deployed and there is an industry-wide trend to
   deprecate MD5 usage.

   RSASHA1 and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 are widely deployed, although zones
   deploying it are recommended to switch to ECDSAP256SHA256 as there is
   an industry-wide trend to move to elliptic curve cryptography.
   RSASHA1 does not support NSEC3.  RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 can be used with
   or without NSEC3.

   DSA and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 are not widely deployed and vulnerable to
   private key compromise when generating signatures using a weak or
   compromised random number generator.

   RSASHA256 is in wide use and considered strong.

   RSASHA512 is NOT RECOMMENDED for DNSSEC Signing because it has not
   seen wide deployment, but there are some deployments hence DNSSEC
   Validation MUST implement RSASHA512 to ensure interoperability.
   There is no significant difference in cryptographics strength between
   RSASHA512 and RSASHA256, therefore it is discouraged to use
   RSASHA512, as it will only make deprecation of older algorithms
   harder.  People that wish to use a cryptographically stronger
   algorithm should switch to elliptic curve cryptography algorithms.

   ECC-GOST (GOST R 34.10-2001) has been superseded by GOST R 34.10-2012
   in [RFC7091].  The GOST R 34.10-2012 hasn't been standardized for use
   in DNSSEC.

   ECDSAP256SHA256 provides more cryptographic strength with a shorter
   signature length than either RSASHA256 or RSASHA512.  ECDSAP256SHA256
   has been widely deployed and therefore it is now at MUST level for
   both validation and signing.  It is RECOMMENDED to use deterministic
   digital signature generation procedure of the ECDSA ([RFC6979]) when
   implementing ECDSAP256SHA256 (and ECDSAP384SHA384).

   ECDSAP384SHA384 shares the same properties as ECDSAP256SHA256, but
   offers a modest security advantage over ECDSAP256SHA256 (192 bits of
   strength versus 128 bits).  For most DNSSEC applications,
   ECDSAP256SHA256 should be satisfactory and robust for the foreseeable
   future, and is therefore recommended for signing.  While it is
   unlikely for a DNSSEC use case requiring 192-bit security strength to
   arise, ECDSA384SHA384 is provided for such applications and it MAY be
   used for signing in these cases.

   ED25519 and ED448 use Edwards-curve Digital Security Algorithm
   (EdDSA).  There are three main advantages of the EdDSA algorithm: It
   does not require the use of a unique random number for each
   signature, there are no padding or truncation issues as with ECDSA,
   and it is more resilient to side-channel attacks.  Furthermore, EdDSA
   cryptography is less prone to implementation errors ([RFC8032],
   [RFC8080]).  It is expected that ED25519 will become the future

   RECOMMENDED default algorithm once there's enough support for this
   algorithm in the deployed DNSSEC validators.

3.2.  DNSKEY Algorithm Recommendation

   Operation recommendation for new and existing deployments.

   Due to industry-wide trend to move to elliptic curve cryptography,
   the ECDSAP256SHA256 is RECOMMENDED DNSKEY algorithm for use by new
   DNSSEC deployments, and users of RSA based algorithms SHOULD upgrade
   to ECDSAP256SHA256.

3.3.  DS and CDS Algorithms

   Recommendations for Delegation Signer Digest Algorithms [DNSKEY-IANA]
   These also apply to the CDS RRTYPE as specified in [RFC7344]

   +--------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------+
   | Number | Mnemonics       | DNSSEC Delegation | DNSSEC Validation |
   +--------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------+
   | 0      | NULL (CDS only) | MUST NOT [*]      | MUST NOT [*]      |
   | 1      | SHA-1           | MUST NOT          | MUST              |
   | 2      | SHA-256         | MUST              | MUST              |
   | 3      | GOST R 34.11-94 | MUST NOT          | MAY               |
   | 4      | SHA-384         | MAY               | RECOMMENDED       |
   +--------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------+

   [*] - This is a special type of CDS record signaling removal of DS at
                          the parent in [RFC8078]

   NULL is a special case, see [RFC8078]

   SHA-1 is still in wide use for DS records, so validators MUST
   implement validation, but it MUST NOT be used to generate new DS and
   CDS records.  (See Operational Considerations for caveats when
   upgrading from SHA-1 to SHA-256 DS Algorithm.)

   SHA-256 is in wide use and considered strong.

   GOST R 34.11-94 has been superseded by GOST R 34.11-2012 in
   [RFC6986].  The GOST R 34.11-2012 hasn't been standardized for use in
   DNSSEC.

   SHA-384 shares the same properties as SHA-256, but offers a modest
   security advantage over SHA-384 (384-bits of strength versus
   256-bits).  For most applications of DNSSEC, SHA-256 should be
   satisfactory and robust for the foreseeable future, and is therefore
   recommended for DS and CDS records.  While it is unlikely for a

   DNSSEC use case requiring 384-bit security strength to arise, SHA-384
   is provided for such applications and it MAY be used for generating
   DS and CDS records in these cases.

3.4.  DS and CDS Algorithm Recommendation

   Operation recommendation for new and existing deployments.

   The SHA-256 is RECOMMENDED DS and CDS algorithm.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security of cryptographic systems depends on both the strength of
   the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of the keys used
   with those algorithms.  The security also depends on the engineering
   of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are no non-
   cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the overall system.

   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of DNSSEC, specifically with the selection of
   "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
   this document as MUST or RECOMMENDED to implement are not known to be
   broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far leads
   us to believe that they are likely to remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this isn't necessarily forever, and it
   is expected that new revisions of this document will be issued from
   time to time to reflect the current best practices in this area.

   Retiring an algorithm too soon would result in a zone signed with the
   retired algorithm being downgraded to the equivalent of an unsigned
   zone.  Therefore, algorithm deprecation must be done very slowly and
   only after careful consideration and measurement of its use.

5.  Operational Considerations

   DNSKEY algorithm rollover in a live zone is a complex process.  See
   [RFC6781] and [RFC7583] for guidelines on how to perform algorithm
   rollovers.

   DS algorithm rollover in a live zone is also a complex process.
   Upgrading algorithm at the same time as rolling the new KSK key will
   lead to DNSSEC validation failures, and users MUST upgrade the DS
   algorithm first before rolling the Key Signing Key.
