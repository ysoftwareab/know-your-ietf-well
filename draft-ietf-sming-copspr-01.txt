Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
   1. Introduction 
    
   This memo presents an SMIng language extension that supports the 
   mapping of SMIng definitions of identities, classes, and their 
   attributes to dedicated definitions of nodes and tables for 
   application in the Policy Based Management framework [RAP-FRWK] 
   using COPS-PR [COPS-PR]. 
    
   Section 2 introduces basics of the Policy Based Management using 
   COPS-PR. 
    
   Section 3 defines how SMIng data types are mapped to the data types 
   supported by the COPS-PR protocol. It introduces some new ASN.1 
   definitions, which are used to represent new SMIng base types such 
   as floats in the COPS-PR protocol. 
    
   Section 4 describes the semantics of the COPS-PR mapping extensions 
   for SMIng.  
    
   Section 5 presents the formal SMIng specification of the extension.  
    
   Section 6 contains a SMIng module that defines data types that are 
   specific to the COPS-PR mapping.  
    
2. Policy Based Management using COPS-PR 
    
   COPS [COPS] is a query/response protocol that allows policy servers 
   to communicate policy decisions to network devices. A Policy server 
   is a PDP (Policy Decision Point) and a network device (policy 
   client) is a PEP (Policy Enforcement Point).  
    
   COPS supports two models for policy control: Outsourcing and 
   Configuration.  
    
   Outsourcing model addresses the kind of events at the PEP that 
   require an instantaneous policy decision. In the outsourcing model, 
   the PEP delegates responsibility to a PDP to make decisions on its 
   behalf.  
    
   In the configuration model, the PDP proactively provision the PDP 
   with the necessary policy information, so that decisions are made or 
   actions are taken right at the PEP. The provisioning may be 
   performed in bulk (e.g., entire router QoS configuration) or in 
   small portions (e.g., updating a access filter on a network device). 
    
   COPS Usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR) protocol describes how 
   base COPS protocol is used for provisioning (configuration model).  
    
   In COPS-PR, policy requests describe the PEP and its configurable 
   parameters. If a change occurs in the parameters, an updated request 
   is sent. Decisions are not necessarily mapped directly to requests, 
   and are issued mostly when the PDP responds to external events or 
   PDP events such as policy updates.

   The data carried by COPS-PR is in the form of a tree structured 
   information store known as Policy Information Base (PIB). The PIB is 
   a conceptual tree namespace of Provisioning Classes (PRCs) and 
   Provisioning Instances (PRIs). There may be multiple instances 
   (PRIs) of any PRC. The tree is shown in the figure below. 
    
             -------+-------+----------+---PRC--+--PRI  
                    |       |          |        +--PRI  
                    |       |          |  
                    |       |          +---PRC-----PRI  
                    |       |  
                    |       +---PRC--+--PRI  
                    |                +--PRI  
                    |                +--PRI  
                    |                +--PRI  
                    |                +--PRI  
                    |  
                    +---PRC---PRI

   PIB modules are written using an adapted subset of SNMP's Structure 
   of Management Information (SMI) [SMIV2]. This structure of Policy 
   Provisioning Information is defined in [SPPI]. 
    
3. SMIng Data Type Mappings  
    
   The SMIng base types are mapped to the COPS-PR base types according 
   to the following table:  
    
              SMIng Data Type    COPS-PR Base Type       Comments 
              ---------------    -----------------       --------

       section 6. 
    
   (2) This type is encoded according to the ASN.1 type with the same 
       name defined in Section 3.1. Please note that SPPI does not  
       have an opaque data type. This is a protocol mapping and COPS-PR 
       can carry the types defined in Section 3.1. 
    
   (3) Counters are mapped to their respective Unsigned Integer types. 
    
   (4) This type is encoded according to the ASN.1 type with the same 
       name defined in Section 3.1.Please note that SPPI does not have 
       an opaque data type. 
    
    
3.1 ASN.1 Definitions 
    
   The ASN.1 [ASN1] type definitions below introduce data types that 
   are used to map new SMIng base types into the set of ASN.1 types 
   supported by the COPS-PR protocol.  
    
    
   IETF-SMING-COPSPR-MAPPING DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN 
    
   Opaque ::= 
       [APPLICATION 4] 
           IMPLICIT OCTET STRING 
    
   Float32 
       [APPLICATION 12] 
           IMPLICIT OCTET STRING (SIZE (4)) 
    
   Float64 
       [APPLICATION 13] 
           IMPLICIT OCTET STRING (SIZE (8)) 
    
   Float128 
       [APPLICATION 14] 
           IMPLICIT OCTET STRING (SIZE (16)) 
   END 
    
   The definitions of the floating-point types Float32, Float64 and 
   Float128 are consistent with the same definitions in [SNMP-MAP]. 
    
    
4. Semantics of COPS-PR mappings 
    
   All the statements in the COPS-PR mapping are explained in this 
   section. Please note that a majority of the statements are similar 
   to the statements that are in SMIng to SNMP mapping [SNMP-MAP] as 
   the SPPI definition for use in COPS-PR is very similar to SMI 
   definition for SNMP. 
    
4.1. The copspr Extension Statement

Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
    
   The 'copspr' statement is the main statement of the COPS-PR mapping 
   specification. It gets one or two arguments: an optional lowercase 
   identifier that can specify a node that represents the module's 
   identity, and a mandatory statement block that contains all details 
   of COPS-PR mapping. A single SMIng module must not contain more than 
   one 'copspr' statement. 
    
4.2. The oid Statement 
    
   The copspr's 'oid' statement, which must be present, if the 'copspr' 
   statement contains a module identifier and must be absent otherwise, 
   gets one argument that specifies the object identifier value that is 
   assigned to the module's identity node. 
    
4.3. The clienttype Statement 
    
   The copspr's 'clienttype' statement, which must be present, 
   identifies one or more categories of provisioning data for which 
   this PIB module defines provisioning information.  For use with the 
   COPS-PR protocol, the individual categories are mapped to COPS 
   Client Types [COPS-PR]. The categories are identified either: 
    
     - Via the keyword "all", indicating the PIB module defines 
   provisioning information relevant for all COPS client-types, or 
    
     - As a list of named-number enumerations, where each number, which 
   must be greater than zero, identifies a COPS client-type.  The 
   namespace for these named numbers is global and therefore the labels 
   should be assigned consistently across PIB modules.  At present 
   time, no more than one named-number enumeration should be specified. 
    
4.4. The node Statement 
    
   The 'node' statement is used to name and describe a node in the 
   object identifier tree, without associating any class or attribute 
   information with this node. This may be useful to group definitions 
   in a sub-tree of related management information, or to uniquely 
   define a SMIng 'identity' to be referenced in attributes of type 
   Pointer.  The 'node' statement gets two arguments: a lower-case node 
   identifier and a statement block that holds detailed node 
   information in an obligatory order. 
    
   See the 'nodeStatement' rule of the SMIng grammar (Section 5) for 
   the formal syntax of the 'node' statement. 
    
4.4.1. The node's oid Statement 
    
   The node's 'oid' statement, which must be present, gets one 
   argument, which specifies the object identifier value that is 
   assigned to this node. 
    
4.4.2. The node's represents Statement

Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
    
   The node's 'represents' statement, which need not be present, makes 
   this node represent an SMIng identity, so that objects of type 
   Pointer can reference that identity. The statement gets one argument 
   that specifies the identity name. 
    
4.4.3. The node's status Statement 
    
   The node's 'status' statement, which need not be present, gets one 
   argument, which is used to specify whether this node definition is 
   current or historic. The value 'current' means that the definition 
   is current and valid. The value 'obsolete' means the definition is 
   obsolete and should not be implemented and/or can be removed if 
   previously implemented.  While the value 'deprecated' also indicates 
   an obsolete definition, it permits new/continued implementation in 
   order to foster interoperability with older/existing 
   implementations.  
    
   If the 'status' statement is omitted, the status value 'current' is 
   implied.  
    
4.4.4. The node's description Statement 
    
   The node's 'description' statement, which need not be present, gets 
   one argument, which is used to specify a high-level textual 
   description of this node.  
    
   It is RECOMMENDED to include all semantics and purposes of this 
   node. 
    
4.4.5. The node's reference Statement 
    
   The node's 'reference' statement, which need not be present, gets 
   one argument, which is used to specify a textual cross-reference to 
   some other document, either another module which defines related 
   definitions, or some other document which provides additional 
   information relevant to this node.  
    
4.4.6. Usage Example 
    
       node   zeroDotZero { 
           oid         0.0; 
           represents  IETF-SMING::null; 
           description "A value used for null identifiers."; 
       }; 
    
4.5. The prc Statement 
    
   The 'prc' statement is used to define the mapping of one or more 
   classes to a single COPS-PR PRC (PRovisioning Class). Provisioning 
   class instances are called PRIs. The 'prc' statement gets two 
   arguments: a lower-case PRC identifier and a statement block that

Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
   holds detailed mapping information of this PRC in an obligatory 
   order. 
    
   See the 'prcStatement' rule of the SMIng grammar (Section 5) for the 
   formal syntax of the 'prc' statement.  
    
4.5.1. The prc's oid Statement 
    
   The prc's 'oid' statement, which must be present, gets one argument, 
   which specifies the object identifier value that is assigned to this 
   PRC. 
    
4.5.2. The prc's anyindex Statement 
    
   The prc's 'anyindex' statement consists of three types of index 
   statement that define the type of the PRC. This statement must be 
   present and only one type of index is allowed in a PRC definition. 
   The three types of index statements are described below.  
    
4.5.2.1. The pibindex Statement 
    
   The 'pibindex' statement is included in definition of a base PRC. It 
   takes one argument that identifies the attribute that is of type 
   'InstanceId'. 
    
   InstanceId identifies a particular instance of a PRC. InstanceId is 
   a typedef described in section 6. As every base PRC definition, 
   except one that uses augments or extends, must have an InstanceId 
   attribute, it is added as the first attribute of the base PRC. 
   Hence, it is not included in the SMIng COPS-PR mapping definition 
   below in section 5. A PRC that augments or extends will not have 
   this InstanceId. 
    
4.5.2.2. The augments Statement 
    
   The 'augments' statement is included in definition of a augmented 
   PRC. This PRC definition augments a base PRC definition. It takes 
   one argument that identifies the class that it augments. 
    
4.5.2.3. The extends Statement 
    
   The 'extends' statement is included in definition of a sparsely 
   augmented PRC. This PRC definition sparsely augments a base PRC 
   definition. It takes one argument that identifies the class that it 
   sparsely augments. 
    
   For more detailed explanation of usage of the above three index 
   statements, please see [SPPI]. 
    
4.5.3. The prc's implements Statement 
    
   The prc's 'implements' statement, which must be present at least 
   once, makes this PRC contain columnar objects that are defined by a

Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
   given class. It gets two arguments: the class being implemented and 
   a statement block that holds detailed information on the attributes 
   of that class being implemented in an obligatory order. 
    
   It is possible to apply multiple implements statements to a single 
   prc statement, each specifying a class. However, to add new 
   attributes (that are added after a revision) from a class that is 
   already implemented, it is possible to have multiple implements 
   statements specifying the same class. This is needed to preserve the 
   order of attributes existing prior to addition of the new 
   attributes. 
    
4.5.3.1. The implements' implobject Statement 
    
   The 'implobject' statement, which must be present at least once, 
   adds the single attribute of the class as a columnar object in the 
   PRC. It gets one argument: the class attribute being implemented. 
   Optionally, the attribute can be qualified with either a 
   'pibreference' statement or 'pibtag' statement.  
    
4.5.3.1.1. The implobject's pibreference Statement 
    
   The 'pibreference' statement, which need not be present, is used to 
   qualify the attribute as a 'ReferenceId'. For details about 
   ReferenceId, please see section 6. It gets one argument, which is 
   the name of the prc that is referenced by this pointer. 
    
4.5.3.1.2. The implobject's pibtag Statement 
    
   The 'pibtag' statement, which need not be present, is used to 
   qualify the attribute as a 'TagReference'. For details about 
   TagReference, please see section 6. This statement gets one 
   argument, which is the name of the attribute in another class, which 
   MUST be of type 'TagId'. For details about TagId, please see section 
   6. Note that the SMIng currently does not support syntax to define 
   groups of instances of a class contained as an attribute in another 
   class. The TagId and TagReference semantics allow us to do that, and 
   this mapping includes that ability. 
    
4.5.4. The prc's status Statement 
    
   The prc's 'status' statement, which need not be present, gets one 
   argument, which is used to specify whether this PRC definition is 
   current or historic. The value 'current' means that the definition 
   is current and valid. The value 'obsolete' means the definition is 
   obsolete and should not be implemented and/or can be removed if 
   previously implemented.  While the value 'deprecated' also indicates 
   an obsolete definition, it permits new/continued implementation in 
   order to foster interoperability with older/existing 
   implementations. 
    
   PRCs SHOULD NOT be defined as 'current' if one or more of their 
   classes are 'deprecated' or 'obsolete'. Similarly, they SHOULD NOT

   be defined as 'deprecated' if one or more of their classes are 
   'obsolete'.  Nevertheless, subsequent revisions of used class 
   definition cannot be avoided, but SHOULD be taken into account in 
   subsequent revisions of the local module. 
    
   If the 'status' statement is omitted the status value 'current' is 
   implied. 
    
4.5.5. The prc's description Statement 
    
   The prc's 'description' statement, which must be present, gets one 
   argument, which is used to specify a high-level textual description 
   of this PRC. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED to include all semantic definitions necessary for 
   the implementation of this PRC. 
    
4.5.6. The prc's reference Statement 
    
   The prc's 'reference' statement, which need not be present, gets one 
   argument which is used to specify a textual cross-reference to some 
   other document, either another module which defines related 
   definitions, or some other document which provides additional 
   information relevant to this prc statement. 
    
4.5.7. The prc's pibaccess Statement 
    
   The prc's 'pibaccess' statement, which must be present, defines what 
   kind of access is appropriate for the PRC.  The value for the 
   pibaccess MUST be one of the following four choices: 
    
   - The value "install" is used to indicate a PRC, which a PDP can 
     install in the PEP as provisioning information. 
    
   - The value "notify" is used to indicate a PRC for which the PEP 
     must notify the PDP of all its instances and attribute values of 
     that PRC. 
    
   - The value "install-notify" is used to indicate the type 
     of PRC which has both characteristics: "install" and "notify". 
    
   - The value "report-only" is used to indicate a PRC which has 
     neither the "install" characteristic nor the "notify"  
     characteristic.  However, instances of such a PRC may be included 
     in synchronous/asynchronous reports generated by the PEP. 
     (Note: PRCs having the "install" and/or "notify" characteristics 
     may also be included in reports generated by the PEP.) 
    
4.5.8. The prc's piberrors Statement 
    
   The prc's 'piberrors' statement, which need not be present, lists 
   one or more potential reasons for rejecting an install or a removal 
   of an instance of the PRC.  Each reason consists of a named-number

   enumeration, where the number represents a PRC-specific error-code 
   to be used in a COPS protocol message, as the Sub-Error Code, with 
   the Error-Code set to priSpecificError (see [COPS-PR]).  The 
   semantics of each named-number enumeration should be described in 
   the prc's description statement. 
    
   The numbers listed in 'piberrors' must be greater than zero and less 
   than 65536.  If this clause is not present, an install/remove can 
   still fail, but no PRC-specific error is available to be reported. 
    
4.5.9. Usage Example 
    
   prc filterTable { 
       oid filterClasses.1; 
       pibindex filterPrid; 
       implements Filter { 
           object name; 
           object packets; 
           object bytes; 
       }; 
       description 
           "A generic filter PRC."; 
   };  
    
   Note that the 'filterPrid' is the PRC's instance identifier of type 
   'InstanceId', and is packaged as the first attribute. 
    
4.6. The group Statement 
    
   The 'group' statement is used to define a group of arbitrary nodes 
   in the object identifier tree.  It gets two arguments: a lower-case 
   group identifier and a statement block that holds detailed group 
   information in an obligatory order.  
    
   The primary application of groups are compliance statements. 
    
   See the 'groupStatement' rule of the SMIng grammar (Section 5) for 
   the formal syntax of the 'group' statement.  
    
4.6.1. The group's oid Statement 
    
   The group's 'oid' statement, which must be present, gets one 
   argument which specifies the object identifier value that is 
   assigned to this group.  
    
4.6.2. The group's members Statement 
    
   The group's 'members' statement, which must be present, gets one 
   argument which specifies the list of nodes by their identifiers to 
   be contained in this group. The list of nodes has to be comma-
   separated and enclosed in parenthesis. 
    
4.6.3. The group's status Statement

Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
    
   The group's 'status' statement, which need not be present, gets one 
   argument which is used to specify whether this group definition is 
   current or historic. The value 'current' means that the definition 
   is current and valid.  The value 'obsolete' means the definition is 
   obsolete and the group should no longer be used.  While the value 
   'deprecated' also indicates an obsolete definition, it permits 
   new/continued use of this group.  
    
   If the 'status' statement is omitted the status value 'current' is 
   implied. 
    
4.6.4. The group's description Statement 
    
   The group's 'description' statement, which must be present, gets one 
   argument which is used to specify a high-level textual description 
   of this group.  It is RECOMMENDED to include any relation to other 
   groups. 
    
4.6.5. The group's reference Statement 
    
   The group's 'reference' statement, which need not be present, gets 
   one argument which is used to specify a textual cross-reference to 
   some other document, either another module which defines related 
   groups, or some other document which provides additional information 
   relevant to this group.  
    
4.6.6. Usage Example 
    
   group frwkPrcSupportGroup { 
       oid           frwkBasePibGroups.1; 
       members       (frwkPrcSupportSupportedPrc, 
                      frwkPrcSupportSupportedAttrs, 
                      frwkPrcSupportMaxPris); 
       description 
           "A collection of object from the frwkPrcSupportTable." 
   }; 
    
4.7. The compliance Statement 
    
   The 'compliance' statement is used to define a set of compliance 
   requirements. It gets two arguments: a lower-case compliance 
   identifier and a statement block that holds detailed compliance 
   information in an obligatory order.  
    
   See the 'complianceStatement' rule of the SMIng grammar (Section 5) 
   for the formal syntax of the 'compliance' statement.  
    
4.7.1. The compliance's oid Statement 
    
   The compliance's 'oid' statement, which must be present, gets one 
   argument which specifies the object identifier value that is 
   assigned to this compliance statement.

Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
    
4.7.2. The compliance's status Statement 
    
   The compliance's 'status' statement, which need not be present, gets 
   one argument which is used to specify whether this compliance 
   statement is current or historic. The value 'current' means that the 
   definition is current and valid. The value 'obsolete' means the 
   definition is obsolete and no longer specifies a valid definition of 
   conformance.  While the value 'deprecated' also indicates an 
   obsolete definition, it permits new/continued use of the compliance 
   specification. 
    
   If the 'status' statement is omitted the status value 'current' is 
   implied. 
    
4.7.3. The compliance's description Statement 
    
   The compliance's 'description' statement, which must be present, 
   gets one argument which is used to specify a high-level textual 
   description of this compliance statement. 
    
4.7.4. The compliance's reference Statement 
    
   The compliance's 'reference' statement, which need not be present, 
   gets one argument which is used to specify a textual cross-reference 
   to some other document, either another module which defines related 
   compliance statements, or some other document which provides 
   additional information relevant to this compliance statement. 
    
4.7.5. The compliance's mandatory Statement 
    
   The compliance's 'mandatory' statement, which need not be present, 
   gets one argument which is used to specify a comma-separated list of 
   one or more groups (Section 4.6) of objects and/or notifications 
   enclosed in parenthesis. These groups are unconditionally mandatory 
   for implementation. 
    
   If the PEP or PDP [RAP-FRWK] claims compliance to a PIB module then 
   it must implement each and every object within each group listed the 
   'mandatory' statement(s) of the compliance statement(s) of that 
   module. 
    
4.7.6. The compliance's optional Statement 
    
   The compliance's 'optional' statement, which need not be present, is 
   repeatedly used to name each group which is conditionally mandatory 
   for compliance to the module. It can also be used to name 
   unconditionally optional groups.  A group named in an 'optional' 
   statement MUST be absent from the correspondent 'mandatory' 
   statement. The 'optional' statement gets two arguments: a lower-case 
   group identifier and a statement block that holds detailed 
   compliance information on that group.

Internet Draft           SMIng COPSPR Mapping                July 2001 
 
 
   Conditionally mandatory groups include those which are mandatory 
   only if a particular protocol is implemented, or only if another 
   group is implemented. The 'description' statement specifies the 
   conditions under which the group is conditionally mandatory. 
    
   A group which is named in neither a 'mandatory' statement nor an 
   'optional' statement, is unconditionally optional for compliance to 
   the module. 
    
   See the 'optionalStatement' rule of the SMIng grammar (Section 5) 
   for the formal syntax of the 'optional' statement. 
    
4.7.6.1. The optional's description Statement 
    
   The optional's 'description' statement, which must be present, gets 
   one argument which is used to specify a high-level textual 
   description of the conditions under which this group is 
   conditionally mandatory or unconditionally optional. 
    
4.7.7. The compliance's refine Statement 
    
   The compliance's 'refine' statement, which need not be present, is 
   repeatedly used to specify each object for which compliance has a 
   refined requirement with respect to the module definition.  The 
   object must be present in one of the conformance groups named in the 
   correspondent 'mandatory' or 'optional' statements. The 'refine' 
   statement gets two arguments: a lower-case identifier of an object 
   and a statement block that holds detailed refinement information on 
   that object.  
    
   See the 'refineStatement' rule of the SMIng grammar (Section 5) for 
   the formal syntax of the 'refine' statement. 
    
4.7.7.1. The refine's installtype Statement 
    
   The refine's 'installtype' statement, which need not be present, 
   gets one argument that is used to provide a refined type for the 
   correspondent object. Type restrictions may be applied by appending 
   subtyping information according to the rules of the base type. See 
   [SMING] for SMIng base types and their type restrictions. 
    
4.7.7.2. The refine's pibminaccess Statement 
    
   The refine's 'pibminaccess' statement, which need not be present, 
   gets one argument that is used to specify the minimal level of 
   access that the correspondent object must implement in the sense of 
   its original 'access' statement. Hence, the refine's 'access' 
   statement MUST NOT specify a greater level of access than is 
   specified in the correspondent object definition. 
    
   An implementation is compliant if the level of access it provides is 
   greater or equal to the minimal level in the refine's 'pibminaccess'

   statement and less or equal to the maximal level in the object's 
   'pibminaccess' statement.  
    
4.7.7.3. The refine's description Statement 
    
   The refine's 'description' statement, which must be present, gets 
   one argument which is used to specify a high-level textual 
   description of the refined compliance requirement. 
    
4.7.8. Usage Example

7. Security Considerations 
    
   This document presents an extension of the SMIng data definition 
   language that supports the mapping of SMIng data definitions so that 
   they can be used with the Policy Based Management framework using 
   COPS-PR. The language extension and the mapping itself have no 
   security impact on the Internet.  
    
8. Acknowledgements 
    
   Since SPPI is very similar to SMIv2, some paragraphs and phrases are 
   directly taken from the SMIng mappings to SNMP Internet Draft [SNMP-
   MAP]. Thanks to the authors of [SNMP-MAP].
