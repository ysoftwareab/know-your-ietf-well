Abstract

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely deployed to
   monitor, control and (sometimes also) configure network elements.
   Even though the SNMP technology is well documented, it remains
   relatively unclear how SNMP is used in practice and what typical SNMP
   usage patterns are.

   This document proposes to carry out large scale SNMP traffic
   measurements in order to develop a better understanding how SNMP is
   used in real world production networks.  It describes the motivation,
   the measurement approach, and the tools and data formats needed to
   carry out such a study.

   This document was produced within the IRTF's Network Management
   Research Group (NMRG) and represents the consensus of all of the
   active contributors to this group.

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) was introduced in the
   late 1980s [RFC1052] and has since then evolved to what is known
   today as the SNMP version 3 Framework (SNMPv3) [RFC3410].  While SNMP
   is widely deployed, it is not clear what protocol versions are being
   used, which protocol features are being used, how SNMP usage differs
   in different types of networks or organizations, which information is
   frequently queried, and what typical SNMP interactions patterns occur
   in real world production networks.

   There have been several publications in the recent past dealing with
   the performance of SNMP in general [SM99][Mal02][Pat01], the impact
   of SNMPv3 security [DSR01][CT04], or the relative performance of SNMP
   compared to Web Services [PDMQ04][PFGL04].  While these papers are
   generally useful to better understand the impact of various design
   decisions and technologies, some of these papers lack a strong
   foundation because authors typically assume certain SNMP interaction
   patterns without having experimental evidence that the assumptions
   are correct.  In fact, there are many speculations how SNMP is being
   used in real world production networks and performance comparisons
   are based on limited test cases, but no systematic measurements have
   been performed and published so far.

   Many authors use the ifTable of the IF-MIB [RFC2863] or the
   tcpConnTable of the TCP-MIB [RFC4022] as a starting point for their
   analysis and comparison.  Despite the fact that there is no evidence
   that operations on these tables dominate SNMP traffic, it is even
   more unclear how these tables are read and which optimizations are
   done (or not done) by real world applications.  It is also unclear
   what the actual traffic trade-off between periodic polling and more
   aperiodic bulk data retrieval is.  Furthermore, we do not generally
   understand how much traffic is devoted to standardized MIB objects
   and how much traffic deals with proprietary MIB objects and whether
   the operation mix between these object classes differs between
   different operational environments (e.g., backbone networks, access
   networks, enterprise networks).

   This document describes an effort to collect SNMP traffic traces in
   order to find answers to some of these questions.  It describes the
   tools that have been developed to allow network operators to collect
   traffic traces and to share them with research groups interested in
   analyzing and modeling network management interactions.

   While the SNMP trace collection and analysis effort was initiated by
   the research community, it should be noted that network operators can
   benefit from the SNMP measurements too.  Several new tools are being
   developed as part of this effort that can be used to capture and

   analyze the traffic generated by management stations.  This resulting
   information can then be used to improve the efficiency and
   scalability of management systems.

   This is an informational document, produced within the IRTF's Network
   Management Research Group (NMRG) and represents the consensus of all
   of the active contributors to this group.

2.  Measurement Approach

   This section outlines the process of doing SNMP traffic measurements
   and analysis.  The process consists of the following five basic
   steps:

   1.  Capture raw SNMP traffic traces in pcap packet capture files [1].

   2.  Convert the raw traffic traces into a structured machine and
       human readable format.  A suitable XML schema has been developed
       for this purpose which captures all SNMP message details.  In
       addition, another more compact comma separated values (CSV)
       format has been developed which only keeps key information about
       SNMP messages.

   3.  Filter the converted traffic traces to hide or anonymize
       sensitive information.  While the filtering is conceptually a
       separate step, filtering may actually be implemented as part of
       the previous data conversion step for efficiency reasons.

   4.  Submit the filtered traffic traces to a repository from where
       they can be retrieved and analyzed.  Such a repository may be
       public, it may be under the control of a research group, or it
       may be under the control of a network operator who commits to run
       analysis scripts on the repository on behalf of researchers.

   5.  Analyze the traces by creating and executing analysis scripts
       which extract and aggregate information.

   Several of the steps listed above require the involvement of network
   operators supporting the SNMP measurement projects.  In many cases,
   the filtered XML and CSV representation of the SNMP traces will be
   the interface between the researchers writing analysis scripts and
   the operators involved in the measurement activity.  It is therefore
   important to have a well defined specification of these interfaces.

   This section provides some advice and concrete hints how the steps
   listed above can be carried out efficiently.  Some special tools have
   been developed to assist network operators and researchers so that
   the time spent on supporting SNMP traffic measurement projects is
   limited.  The following sections describe the five steps and some
   tools in more detail.

2.1.  Capturing Traffic Traces

   Capturing SNMP traffic traces can be done using packet sniffers such
   as tcpdump [2], wireshark [3], or similar applications.  Some care
   must be taken to specify pcap filter expressions that match the SNMP



Schoenwaelder            Expires August 15, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


   transport endpoints used to carry SNMP traffic (typically 'udp and
   (port 161 or port 162)').  Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure
   that full packets are captured, that is packets are not truncated
   (tcpdump option -s 0).  Finally, it is necessary to carefully select
   the placement of the capturing probe within the network.  Especially
   on bridged LANs, it is important to ensure that all management
   traffic is captured and that the probe has access to all virtual LANs
   carrying management traffic.  This usually requires placing the
   probe(s) close to the management system(s) and to configure dedicated
   monitoring ports on bridged networks.  Some bridges have restrictions
   concerning their monitoring capabilities and this should be
   investigated and documented where necessary.

   It is recommended to capture at least a full week of data.  Operators
   are encouraged to capture traces over even longer periods of time.
   Tools such as tcpslice [2] or pcapmerge [4] can be used to split or
   merge pcap trace files as needed.

   Several operating systems can offload some of the TCP/IP processing
   such as the calculation of transport layer checksum to network
   interface cards.  Traces that include traffic to/from a capturing
   interface which supports TCP/IP offloading can include incorrect
   transport layer checksums.  The simplest solution is of course to
   turn checksum offloading off while capturing traces (if that is
   feasible without loosing too many packets).  The other solution is to
   correct or ignore checksums during the subsequent conversion of the
   raw pcap files.

   It is important to note that the raw pcap files should ideally be
   kept in permanent storage (e.g., compressed and encrypted on a CD ROM
   or DVD).  To verify measurements, it might be necessary to go back to
   the original pcap files if, for example, bugs in the tools described
   below have been detected and fixed.

   For each captured trace, some meta data should be recorded and made
   available.  The meta data should include information such as where
   the trace was collected, when it was collected, contact information,
   the size of the trace, any known special events, equipment failures,
   or major infrastructure changes during the data collection period and
   so on.  It is also extremely useful to provide a unique
   identification.  There are special online services such as DatCat [5]
   where meta data can be stored and which provide unique identifiers.

2.2.  Converting Traffic Traces

   Raw traces in pcap format must be converted into a format that is
   human readable while remaining also machine readable for efficient
   post-processing.  Human readability makes it easy for an operator to



Schoenwaelder            Expires August 15, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


   verify that no sensitive data is left in a trace while machine
   readability is needed to efficiently extract relevant information.

   The natural choice here is to use an XML format since XML is human as
   well as machine readable and there are many tools and high-level
   scripting language application programming interfaces (APIs) that can
   be used to process XML documents and to extract meaningful
   information.  However, it should be noted that XML is also pretty
   verbose which increases processing overhead.  In particular, the
   usage of XML streaming APIs is strongly suggested since APIs that
   require an in memory representation of XML documents do not handle
   large traces well.

   Section 4.1 of this document defines a RELAX NG schema [OASISRNG] for
   representing SNMP traffic traces in XML.  The schema captures all
   relevant details of an SNMP message in the XML format.  Note that the
   XML format retains some information about the original ASN.1/BER
   encoding to support message size analysis.

   A lightweight alternative to the full blown XML representation based
   on comma separated values (CSV) is defined in Section 4.2.  The CSV
   format only captures selected parts of SNMP messages and is thus more
   compact and faster to process.

   As explained in the previous sections, analysis programs which
   process raw pcap files should have an option to ignore incorrect
   checksums caused by TCP/IP offloading.  In addition, analysis
   programs which process raw pcap files should be able to perform IP
   reassembly for SNMP messages that got fragmented at the IP layer.

   The snmpdump [6] package has been developed to convert raw pcap files
   into XML and CSV format.  The snmpdump program reads pcap, XML, or
   CSV files as input and produces XML files or CSV files as output.
   Specific elements can be filtered as required to protect sensitive
   data.

2.3.  Filtering Traffic Traces

   Filtering sensitive data (e.g., access control lists or community
   strings) can be achieved by manipulating the XML representation of an
   SNMP trace.  Standard XSLT processors (e.g., xsltproc [7]) can be
   used for this purpose.  People familiar with the scripting language
   Perl might be interested in choosing a suitable Perl module to
   manipulate XML documents [8].

   The snmpdump program, for example, can filter out sensitive
   information, e.g., by deleting or clearing all XML elements whose
   name matches a regular expression.  In addition, data type specific



Schoenwaelder            Expires August 15, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


   anonymization transformations that maintain lexicographic ordering
   for values that appear in instance identifiers [HS06] can be applied.
   Note that anonymization transformations are often bound to an
   initialization key and depend on the data being anonymized in an
   anonymization run.  As a consequence, users must be careful when they
   merge data from independently anonymized traces.  More information
   about network traffic trace anonymization techniques can be found in
   [XFA02], [FXAM04], [PAPL06], and [RW07].

2.4.  Storing Traffic Traces

   The raw pcap traces as well as the XML / CSV formatted traces should
   be stored in a stable archive or repository.  Such an archive or
   repository might either be maintained by research groups (e.g., the
   NMRG) or by network operators or both.  It is of key importance that
   captured traces are not lost or modified as they may form the basis
   of future research projects and may also be needed to verify
   published research results.  Access to the archive might be
   restricted to those who have signed some sort of a non-disclosure
   agreement.

   While this document recommends that raw traces should be kept, it
   must be noted that there are situations where this may not be
   feasible.  The recommendation to keep raw traces may be ignored for
   example to comply with data protection laws or to protect a network
   operator from being forced to provide the data to other
   organizations.

   Lossless compression algorithms embodied in programs such as gzip or
   bzip2 can be used to compress even large trace files down to a size
   where they can be burned on DVDs for cheap long-term storage.

   It must be stressed again that it is important to keep the original
   pcap traces in addition to the XML / CSV formatted traces since the
   pcap traces are the most authentic source of information.
   Improvements in the tool chain may require to go back to the original
   pcap traces and to rebuild all intermediate formats from them.

2.5.  Analyzing Traffic Traces

   Scripts that analyze traffic traces must be verified for correctness.
   Ideally, all scripts used to analyze traffic traces would be
   publically accessible so that third parties can verify them.
   Furthermore, sharing scripts will enable other parties to repeat an
   analysis on other traffic traces and to extend such analysis scripts.
   A common versioned repository for analysis scripts might be useful to
   establish.

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


   Due to the availability of XML parsers and the simplicity of the CSV
   format, trace files can be processed with tools written in almost any
   programming language.  However, in order to facilitate a common
   vocabulary and to allow operators to easily read scripts they execute
   on trace files, it is suggested that analysis scripts are written in
   scripting languages such as Perl using suitable Perl modules to
   manipulate XML documents [8].  Using a scripting language such as
   Perl instead of system programming languages such as C or C++ has the
   advantage to reduce development time and to make scripts more
   accessible to operators who may want to verify scripts before running
   them on trace files which potentially contain sensitive data.

   It should be noted here that the snmpdump tool provides an API to
   process SNMP messages in C/C++.  While the coding of trace analysis
   programs in C/C++ should in general be avoided for code readability,
   verifiability and portability reasons, using C/C++ might be the only
   option to deal with very large traces efficiently.

   It should be noted that any results produced by analyzing a trace
   must be interpreted in the context of the trace.  The nature of the
   network, the attachment point used to collect the trace, the nature
   of the applications generating SNMP traffic, or the events that
   happened while the trace was collected clearly influence the result.
   It is therefore important to be careful when drawing general
   conclusions based on a potentially (too) limited data set.

3.  Analysis of Traffic Traces

   This section discusses several questions that can be answered by
   analyzing SNMP traffic traces.  The questions raised in the following
   subsections are meant to be illustrative and no attempt has been made
   to provide a complete list.

3.1.  Basic Statistics

   Basic statistics cover things such as

   o  protocol version used,

   o  protocol operations used,

   o  message size distribution,

   o  error message type frequency, or

   o  usage of authentication and encryption mechanisms.

   In addition, the OID names of the objects manipulated can be
   categorized into OID subtrees, for example to identify
   'standardized', 'proprietary', and 'experimental' objects.

3.2.  Periodic vs. Aperiodic Traffic

   SNMP is used to periodically poll devices as well as to retrieve
   information on request of an operator or application.  The periodic
   polling leads to periodic traffic patterns while the on demand
   information retrieval causes more aperiodic traffic patterns.  It is
   worthwhile to understand what the relationship is between the amount
   of periodic and aperiodic traffic.  In addition, it will be
   interesting to research whether there are multiple levels of
   periodicity at different time scales.

   The periodic polling behavior may dependent on the application and
   the polling engine it uses.  For example, some management platforms
   allow applications to specify how long polled values may be kept in a
   cache before it is polled again.  Such optimizations needs to be
   considered when analyzing traces for periodic and aperiodic traffic.

3.3.  Message Size and Latency Distributions

   SNMP messages are size constrained by the transport mappings used and
   the buffers provided by the SNMP engines.  For the further evolution
   of the SNMP framework, it would be useful to know what the actual
   message size distributions are.  In addition, it would be useful to



Schoenwaelder            Expires August 15, 2008               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


   understand the latency distributions, especially the distribution of
   the processing times by SNMP command responders.  Some SNMP
   implementations approximate networking delays by measuring request-
   response times and it would be useful to understand to what extent
   this is a viable approach.

   Some SNMP implementations update their counters from the underlying
   instrumentation following adaptive algorthms, not necessarily
   periodically, and not necessarily on-demand.  The granularity of
   internal counter updates may impact latency measurements and should
   be taken into account.

3.4.  Concurrency Levels

   SNMP allows management stations to retrieve information from multiple
   agents concurrently.  It will be interesting to identify what the
   typical concurrency level is that can be observed on production
   networks or whether management applications prefer more sequential
   ways of retrieving data.

   In addition, it will be interesting to analyze how many redundant
   requests coming from applications are processed almost simultaneously
   by a device.

3.5.  Table Retrieval Approaches

   Tables can be read in several different ways.  The simplest and most
   inefficient approach is to retrieve tables object-by-object in
   column-by-column order.  More advanced approaches try to read tables
   row-by-row or even multiple-rows-by-multiple-rows.  In addition, the
   retrieval of index elements can be suppressed in most cases or only a
   subset of columns of a table are retrieved.  It will be useful to
   know which of these approaches are actually used on production
   networks.

3.6.  Trap-Directed Polling - Myths or Reality?

   SNMP is built around a concept called trap-directed polling.
   Management applications are responsible to periodically poll SNMP
   agents to determine their status.  SNMP agents can in addition send
   traps to notify SNMP managers about events so that SNMP managers can
   adopt their polling strategy and basically react faster than normal
   polling would allow to do.

   Analysis of SNMP traffic traces can identify whether trap-directed
   polling is actually deployed.  In particular, the question that
   should be addressed is whether SNMP notifications lead to changes in
   the short-term polling behavior of management stations.  In



Schoenwaelder            Expires August 15, 2008               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


   particular, it should be investigated to what extent SNMP managers
   use automated procedures to track down the meaning of the event
   conveyed by an SNMP notification.

3.7.  Popular MIB Definitions

   An analysis of object identifier prefixes can identify the most
   popular MIB modules and the most important object types or
   notification types defined by these modules.  Such information would
   be very valuable for the further maintenance and development of these
   and related MIB modules.

3.8.  Usage of Obsolete Objects

   Several objects from the early days have been obsoleted because they
   cannot properly represent today's networks.  A typical example is the
   ipRouteTable which was obsoleted because it was not able to represent
   classless routing, introduced and deployed on the Internet in 1993.
   Some of these obsolete objects are still mentioned in popular
   publications as well as research papers.  It will be interesting to
   find out whether they are also still used by management applications
   or whether management applications have been updated to use the
   replacement objects.

   Depending on the data recorded in a trace, it might be possible to
   determine the age of devices by looking at values of objects such as
   sysObjectID and sysDecr [RFC3418].  The age of a device can then be
   taken into consideration when analyzing the use of obsolete and
   deprecated objects.

3.9.  Encoding Length Distributions

   It will be useful to understand the encoding length distributions for
   various data types.  Assumptions about encoding length distributions
   are sometimes used to estimate SNMP message sizes in order to meet
   transport and buffer size constraints.

3.10.  Counters and Discontinuities

   Counters can experience discontinuities [RFC2578].  A widely used
   discontinuity indicator is the sysUpTime scalar of the SNMPv2-MIB
   [RFC3418], which can be reset through a warm start to indicate
   counter discontinuities.  Some MIB modules introduce more specific
   discontinuity indicators, e.g., the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime of the

   these objects are actually used by management applications to handle
   discontinuity events.

3.11.  Spin Locks

   Cooperating command generators can use advisory locks to coordinate
   their usage of SNMP write operations.  The snmpSetSerialNo scalar of
   the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is the default course-grain coordination
   object.  It will be interesting to find out whether there are command
   generators which coordinate themselves using these spin locks.

3.12.  Row Creation

   Row creation is an operation not natively supported by the protocol
   operations.  Instead, conceptual tables supporting row creation
   typically provide a control column which uses the RowStatus textual
   convention defined in the SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579] module.  The RowStatus
   itself supports different row creation modes, namely createAndWait
   (dribble-mode) and createAndGo (one-shot mode).  In addition,
   different approaches can be used to derive the instance identifier if
   it does not have special semantics associated.  It will be useful to
   study which of the various row creation approaches are actually used
   by management applications on production networks.

   with SNMP messages.  The format is specified in RELAX NG compact
   notation [OASISRNC].  Freely available tools such as trang [9] can be
   used to convert RELAX NG compact syntax to other XML schema
   notations.

4.2.  CSV Representation

   The comma separated values (CSV) format has been designed to capture
   only the most relevant information about an SNMP message.  In
   situation where all information about an SNMP message must be
   captured, the XML format defined above must be used.  The CSV format
   uses the following fields:

   1.   Time-stamp in the format seconds.microseconds since 1970, for
        example "1137764769.425484".

   2.   Source IP address in dotted quad notation (IPv4), for example
        "192.0.2.1", or compact hexadecimal notation (IPv6), for example
        "2001:DB8::1".

   3.   Source port number represented as a decimal number, for example
        "4242".

   4.   Destination IP address in dotted quad notation (IPv4), for
        example "192.0.2.1", or compact hexadecimal notation (IPv6), for
        example "2001:DB8::1".

   5.   Destination port number represented as a decimal number, for
        example "161".

   6.   Size of the SNMP message (a decimal number) counted in octets,
        for example "123".  The size excludes all transport, network,
        and link-layer headers.

   7.   SNMP message version represented as a decimal number.  The
        version 0 stands for SNMPv1, 1 for SNMPv2c, and 3 for SNMPv3,
        for example "3".

   8.   SNMP protocol operation indicated by one of the keywords get-
        request, get-next-request, get-bulk-request, set-request, trap,
        snmpV2-trap, inform-request, response, report.

   9.   SNMP request-id in decimal notation, for example "1511411010".

   10.  SNMP error-status in decimal notation, for example "0".

   11.  SNMP error-index in decimal notation, for example "0".

   12.  Number of variable-bindings contained in the varbind-list in
        decimal notation, for example "5".

   13.  For each varbind in the varbind list, three output elements are
        generated

Internet-Draft          SNMP Traffic Measurements          February 2008


        1.  Object name given as object identifier in dotted decimal
            notation, for example "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0".  Object names are
            separated by commas.

        2.  Object base type name or exception name, that is one of the
            following: null, integer32, unsigned32, counter32,
            counter64, timeticks, ipaddress, octet-string, object-
            identifier, opaque, no-such-object, no-such-instance, and
            end-of-mib-view.

        3.  Object value is printed as a number if the underlying base
            type is numeric.  An IPv4 addresses is rendered in the
            dotted quad notation and an IPv6 address is rendered in the
            usual hexadecimal notation.  An octet string value is
            printed in hexadecimal format while an object identifier
            value is printed in dotted decimal notation.  In case of an
            exception, the object value is an empty string.

   Note that the format does not preserve the information needed to
   understand SNMPv1 traps.  It is therefore recommended that
   implementations are able to convert the SNMPv1 trap format into the
   trap format used by SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, according to the rules
   defined in [RFC3584].  The activation of trap format conversion
   should be the user's choice.

   The following example shows an SNMP trace file in CSV format
   containing an SNMPv1 get-next-request message for the OID
   1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3 (sysUpTime) and the response message returned by the
   agent.  (Note that the example uses backslash line continuation marks
   in order to fit the example into the RFC format.  Backslash line
   continuations are not part of the CSV format.)

5.  Security Considerations

   SNMP traffic traces usually contain sensitive information.  It is
   therefore necessary to (a) remove unwanted information and (b) to
   anonymize the remaining necessary information before traces are made
   available for analysis.  In addition, it is recommended to encrypt
   traces when they are archived.

   Implementations that generate XML traces from raw pcap files should
   have an option to suppress or anonymize values.  Note that instance
   identifiers of tables also include values and it might therefore be
   necessary to suppress or anonymize (parts of) the instance
   identifiers.  Similarly, the packet and message headers typically
   contain sensitive information about the source and destination of
   SNMP messages as well as authentication information (community
   strings or user names).

   Anonymization techniques can be applied to keep information in traces
   which could otherwise reveal sensitive information.  When using
   anonymization, values should only be added when the underlying data
   type is known and an appropriate anonymization transformation is
   available (filter-in principle).  For values appearing in instance
   identifiers, it is usually desirable to maintain the lexicographic
   order.  Special anonymization transformations which preserve this
   property have been developed, although their anonymization strength
   is usually reduced compared to transformations that do not preserve
   lexicographic ordering [HS06].
