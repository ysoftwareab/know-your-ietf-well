  1. Introduction
 
   Mobile IP [X] specifies a protocol for a node to receive packets 
   destined to its home IP address even when the node is not present in 
   its home network. It specifies registration request (RRQ) and 
   response (RRP) messages between the mobile node and a Home Agent. The 
   HA then receives packets on behalf of the mobile node and tunnels the 
   packets to the present location of the mobile node. The RRQ and RRP 
   messages must be authenticated using key shared by the mobile node 
   and its home agent. 
    
   In some cases, such as cases where nodes connecting to the network do 
   not have a Mobile IP stack but require mobility services, the network 
   may have to rely on a proxy (called the Proxy Mobile Node, PMN) to 
   generate the registration requests and process the registration 
   responses on behalf of the node. To ensure Mobile IP compatible 
   behavior, the control packets from the PMN must be sent via the 
   current subnet of the mobile node. So the MIP control packets 
   generated by the PMN are tunneled via an assistant function that 
   resides in the current subnet of the mobile node (located say in a 
   foreign agent or an access point). Thus the PMN (and the PMN-HA key) 
   can reside in a single/secure location even as the mobile nodes moves 
   from one subnet to another 
    
      This document describes a scheme by which a proxy mobile node can 
   obtain the keys to generate registration requests and validate the 
   response from the Home agent.

  2. Terminology and Assumptions 
    

    
   Mobile Node (MN) (peer) 
      
     The entity that includes EAP peer functionality as described by 
     [EAP3748] and keying frameworks [EAPKEY], with the exception that 
     mobile node may not have a direct link to the EAP pass-through 
     authenticator. In this document we may use the terms MN and EAP 
     peer interchangeably. MN is the entity whose records are kept at 
     the AAA server and is authorized for various network services. 
    
   Proxy Mobile Node (PMN): 
    
     An entity in that generates RRQs on behalf of a mobile node and 
     processes the RRPs. PMN is also the entity that is final key 
     holder for the PMIP Key. 
    
   Proxy MIP key (PMIP key): 
    
     A key that is shared between the Proxy Mobile Node (PMN) and the 
     home agent and is used to generate the Mobile-Home-Authentication 
     extension to be included in Mobile IP registration requests (RRQ) 
     and/or responses (RRP). 
 
   MN-AAA key 
     The MN-AAA key is the basis for the creation of all the keys that 
     are created dynamically between MN and its mobility agents. MN-AAA 
     key is used for calculation of the authenticator field inside an 
     MN-AAA-Authentication extension [RFC3012bis04] included in a 
     Mobile IP registration request for the home agent and verified by 
     the home AAA server. The details of Mobile IPv4 key bootstrapping 
     are covered in [RFC3957] and [RADIUS-MIP]. Note that this key is 
     different from a possible PMN-AAA key, that may be established 
     between PMN and the AAA server (if needed). 
 
   Home agent (HA) 
     A Mobile IP Home Agent that is responsible for generating and 
     keeping a binding between mobile node home address and its care of 
     address. 
 
   EAP server 
      
     EAP server is the entity that engages in EAP method exchange and 
     terminates the EAP authentication method with peer as defined in 
     [EAP3748]. EAP server is capable of generating and exporting 
     relevant EAP keys as defined in [EAP-KEY].

   Home AAA server 
    
     HAAA server is the entity that is the main point of trust and 
     authorization (AAA) in the administrative domain, and maintains 
     peer information and possibly keying information.  The AAA server 
     relies on EAP server for execution of EAP-method authentications. 
    
   EAP pass-through Authenticator 
    
     The pass-through authenticator is the entity between a peer and a 
     backend EAP server that is passing through EAP Request and Response 
     messages ([RFC3748]) without understanding their data content.  It 
     can understand EAP success and failure messages.  The authenticator 
     may not necessarily be the terminating point for the physical 
     access link to the peer. 
      
   AAA client 
     The first AAA entity (from mobile node side), that engages in AAA 
     protocol conversation with the AAA infrastructure leading to the 
     home AAA server. This entity is also responsible for encapsulating 
     EAP messaging inside AAA protocol messages (RADIUS, [RFC3579] or 
     Diameter). The logical AAA client is not responsible for 
     understanding EAP messaging, however, it is the physical entity 
     that receives any transported master keys produced as part EAP 
     keying process, if the transport is performed through AAA 
     protocols. According to current EAP keying documentation AAA layer 
     entities are to delete the transported keys and this may mean a 
     logical AAA client will not have an authority to act as a key 
     holder. 
    
   Key holder 
      
     This entity is the one that holds the master key received from AAA 
     server and possibly performs further key derivations and 
     distribution functions for access nodes. In WiMAX architecture, the 
     authenticator function is split between a key holder that receives 
     the master keys from the AAA server and key receiver that also 
     performs EAP relay function. In this document we assume the key 
     holder is part of authenticator that receives the PMIP-key (also 
     the AAA client) and use authenticator and key holder definitions 
     interchangeably. 
      
   
  3.  Overview 
    

   The objective for a PMIP keying solution is to establish a shared key 
   between the PMN and HA so that they are able exchange authenticated 
   MIP registration messages.  

 
 
Nakhjiri et. al.         Expires - June 2006                 [Page 4] 

                                                                       
 
 
   Our basic idea is to enable the AAA server derive a PMIP key and 
   transport the key to the PMN in conjunction with the EAP access 
   network authentication. So that the PMN can generate authenticated 
   Mobile IP registration requests (RRQ) towards the HA by using the 
   PMIP key as message authentication key.  
   When a HA receives its first registration request corresponding to a 
   mobile node from the PMN, the HA can obtain the corresponding key 
   from the AAA. 
   Note that this requires the AAA server to cache the PMIP key or 
   related keying material and later retrieve the key for delivery to HA 
   upon request.  
    
   The following diagram provides a summary of the entities in the 
   system, the flow of PMIP keying material to the PMN and the Home 
   Agent and the data path from the Home agent to the MN via a optional 
   foreign Agent.

   The operation is as follows (shown in Figure 2) 
        . During network entry the mobile node (MN) performs an EAP 
           authentication with the EAP server collocated with home AAA server 
           via the pass-through authenticator.  
        . After successful EAP authentication, the home AAA server after 
           examining the MN service policies and/or possibly receiving 
           specific requests (through initial AAA requests) for Proxy Mobile 
           IP service, authorizes the MN for Proxy Mobile IP service. Upon 
           this authorization, the AAA server (acting as AAA layer in EAP 
           framework) requests a specific AMSK for proxy Mobile IP application 
           from the EAP layer. The EAP layer at AAA server based on the 
           request from the AAA layer calculates the PMIP-AMSK from the EMSK 
           as follows:

     PMIP AMSK = PRF (EMSK, MN_ID |Authenticator_ID| "PMIP Application 
     Key"| Key length)  
    
        . Note that Home Agent ID is not used in the key binding to allow 
           flexibility towards alternative dynamic home agent assignments.

        . The AAA server has now access to the PMIP-AMSK and can either use 
           the PMIP-AMSK to generate the PMIP-key (PMN-HA key) or send the 
           PMIP-AMSK to the authenticator/ AAA client to do so instead. The 
           latter alternative however may cause problems if the EAP Keying 
           framework [EAPKEY] requires the AAA entities to delete all 
           transported keys (including AMSKs) after transport, as the AAA 
           server later needs to supply this to HA later upon request. 
           Therefore, we recommend the AAA server to calculate the PMIP-key 
           from the PMIP-AMSK locally as one of the following alternatives: 
                                      
          PMIP-key=Truncate(PMIP-AMSK, required PMIP-key length) 
                                      
                PMIP-key=PRF(PMIP-AMSK, other information) 
        . When the AAA server calculates the PMIP-key from the PMIP AMSK, the 
           PMIP-key is then sent securely to the AAA client using appropriate 
           AAA protocol mechanisms (RADIUS attributes or Diameter AVP) 
           following or around the same time as when an EAP success is being 
           sent to the EAP peer through the EAP pass-through authenticator. 
           Typically the pass-through authenticator is collocated with the AAA 

 
 
Nakhjiri et. al.         Expires - June 2006                 [Page 6] 

                                                                       
 
 
           client, so the EAP success and the PMIP-Key may be sent through the 
           same AAA message, assuming proper and secure key wrapping 
           mechanisms are provided for that message. At any rate the AAA 
           client function will pass the PMIP-key to the authenticator for 
           storage. 
        . In WiMAX operation it is expected that the AAA server may also 
           needs to also provide proper authorization information for the 
           802.16e access link, mobile node network operation (e.g. an 
           assigned Home Address information, HoA and other entities, such the 
           Proxy Mobile Node for performing Proxy Mobile IP service, including 
           necessary authorizations for the PMN (e.g. IP address for a Home 
           Agent, HA, if available), as well as other necessary information 
           such as key lifetimes, and possible SPI information. This 
           information is sent through the AAA protocol to the AAA client 
           function to the final destination. The life time for PMIP-key and 
           related PMIP authorization must never exceed the life time of the 
           EAP session.  
        . The authenticator co-located with the AAA client will access the 
           PMIP-Key and other related information and passes the key to the 
           Proxy Mobile Node (PMN) function. It is possible for the PMN and 
           the authenticator to be physically collocated to avoid compromise 
           of the PMIP key due to additional transfers. It is possible that 
           the PMN function is in another entity physically separate (such as 
           inside a base station or foreign agent) from the authenticator, in 
           which case, care must be taken in transferring the PMIP-key to the 
           PMN.  
        . When the PMN generates a registration request (RRQ) it uses the 
           PMIP key to create the Mobile-Home Authentication Extension (MHAE) 
           to authenticate the registration request to the HA. 
        . When a HA receives a registration request, if it does not have the 
           SPI/keys corresponding to the security association with the PMN, it 
           queries the AAA server via an AAA Request message.  
        . The AAA server validates the request and sends the PMIP key (PMN-HA 
           key) corresponding to the requesting HA in a AAA Response message. 
        . After receiving the PMIP key, the HA validates the MHAE in RRQ, and 
           processes the RRQ and generates a registration response with a 
           valid authentication extension using the same PMN-HA key.

   Note: An alternative method for generation of PMIP-key has been 
   suggested as follows: 
   Instead of generating the PMIP-key from PMIP-AMSK directly, it has 
   been suggested to use the PMIP-AMSK to derive a so called PMN-AAA key 
   that can be used to bootstrap the PMIP-key through direct 
   interactions between the PMN (rather than the mobile node) and AAA 
   server at a later time using [RFC3957]. We will cover a short 
   description of this method in an appendix. 
 
    
  4. Security considerations 
    

   The PMN may be co-located with the authenticator itself or may reside 
   separately. In any case the PMIP or PMIP-AAA key must be securely 
   provided from the authenticator function to the PMN function. The 
   protocol between the PMN and the authenticator is beyond the scope of 
   this document. 
 
   It should be noted that, peer mobility may result in need of handover 
   between the physical entities the PMN is associated with. In such 
   cases, to avoid the security issues with compromise of PMIP-key and 
   to avoid the need for new interactions with the backend server, the 
   initial PMN, so called PMN anchor will hold on to the PMIP-key and 
   will perform any needed PMIP security functions in interacting with 
   other Mobile IP entities.

    Appendix A Use of PMIP-AMSK as PMN-AAA key 
    
   This section describes an second alternative to bootstrapping the 
   Proxy Mobile IP keys using the PMIP-AMSK derived from EAP 
   authentication as PMN-AAA key. According to this proposal the PMN-AAA 
   key is used instead of the MN-AAA key in the process defined in 
   [RFC3957] and [RADIUS-MIP] to bootstrap PMN-HA key through the AAA 
   server. In this method:  
        . The AAA server after receiving the PMIP-AMSK from the EAP layer 
           (following EAP authentication) calculates a PMN-AAA key from the 
           PMIP-AMSK through a straightforward method (PMN-AAA key=PRF( PMIP-
           AMSK, other PMIP info)) and sends a copy of PMN-AAA and sends 
           another copy to the authenticator through the AAA client. 
        . The authenticator passes the PMN-AAA key to the PMN for further 
           PMIP key bootstrapping with the AAA server. 
        . When the PMN needs to send a registration request to the HA, since 
           the PMN does not have access to the PMN-HA key, it indicates the 
           need for PMN-HA key by including an MN-AAA Authentication extension 
           in the RRQ submitted to HA, where the PMN-AAA key is used for 
           calculation of the authenticator field within the extension. When 
           the HA receives an RRQ with MN-AAA AE, it needs to refer to the AAA 
           server for retrieval of a PMN-HA key. It should be noted that this 
           method would require the AAA server to have access to a copy 
           (generate and/or store) of the PMN-AAA key for verification of MN-
           AAA Authentication extension, when the AAA server receives the RRQ 
           submitted by the HA later on. 
        . Upon verification of the MN-AAA AE and access to MN profile, the 
           AAA calculates a PMIP-nonce (PMN-HA nonce) and a corresponding 
           PMIP-key (PMN-HA key), using the PMN-AAA key and procedures defined 
           in [RFC3957], and sends the nonce to the PMN in the clear and the 
           encrypted PMIP-key to the HA. 
   The authors believe that due to the transitive security associations 
   provided between the AAA server and PMN (through AAA server-AAA 
   client/ authenticator SA and authenticator-PMN SA), the nonce 
   creation is unnecessarily complex. Furthermore, RFC3957 will still

   require the HA to query AAA server for retrieval of the PMIP key and 
   furthermore, it requires distribution of nonces to the PMN even 
   though the PMN may be a trusted by the authenticator.
