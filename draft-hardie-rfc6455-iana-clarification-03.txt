Internet-Draft         RFC6455 IANA clarification              June 2016


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6455] section 11.5 sets up a Subprotocol Name Registry at IANA
   and directs IANA to use First Come First Serve registration
   procedures as set out in [RFC5226].  The reuse of this registry by
   other protocols has indicated that some clarification of the
   instructions to IANA would be useful.

2.  Clarified instructions

   The tokens registered in the Websockets sub-protocol registry created
   by RFC 6455 Section 11.5 are matched using case-sensitive string
   match.  IANA is, however, instructed to decline registrations in the
   registry which differ only as to case, in order to minimize potential
   confusion among different registered versions.  For other useful
   advice on avoiding collision, registrants are encouraged to consult
   the non-normative section 1.9 of RFC 6455.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an update to registry policy, not a protocol.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document is, in its entirety, a clarification of the registry
   policy for the Websockets sub-protocol name registry.  As part of
   this clarification, IANA is requested to list both this document and
   RFC 6455 as references for the Websockets sub-protocol registry.  In
   addition, IANA is requested to include the following note under the
   registry's Registration Procedures: "Please see Section 2 of RFC
   XXXX, which clarifies that registrations which differ from existing
   registrations only by case will be refused."

   document shepherd.
