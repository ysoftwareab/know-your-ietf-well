1. Abstract 
    
   This document gives examples of SIP call flows for T.38 Internet fax 
   communications (SIP, the Session Initiation Protocol is defined in 
   RFC2543 [2] and T.38 is an ITU-T Recommendation [3]).  Elements in 
   these call flows include SIP User Agents, SIP Proxy Servers, and 
   Gateways to the PSTN (Public Switch Telephone Network). 
   This document introduces best current practices for T.38 fax calls: 
   a call starts with audio capabilities, and, upon fax tone detection, 
   T.38 fax capabilities are negotiated.  The T.38 fax call scenarios 
   include the detection of T.38 fax transmission by the receiving 
   side, or the emitting side, or both (in the latter case, a 'glare' 
   effect may appear).  The current version of this document only 
   covers the case when the fax tone is detected by the receiving side 
   (other cases were left for discussion and may be included in the 
   future).  Call flow diagrams and message details are shown.  A list 
   of IANA defined SDP attribute names for T.38 is summarized in 
   section 5.

3. Overview 
    
   The call flows shown in this document complements the overall SIP 
   call flow Internet Draft [5].  It is the intent of the authors to 
   merge these T.38 specific call flows into the main I-D. 
   The current version of this document deals primarily with T.38 over 
   UDPTL (T.38 fax calls over TCP using SIP may be added in the future;  
   the call flows would use the same principles with different media 
   descriptions). 
   These T.38 call flows were developed in the design of carrier-class 
   SIP Telephony products supporting voice and real-time fax traffic. 
   It is the hope of the authors that this document will be useful for 
   the SIP community, SIP implementors of T.38 fax products, designers. 
   These call flows are based on the current version 2.0 of SIP in 
   RFC2543[6], the ITU-T T.38 Amendment 2 [7] and a SG8 liaison to 
   IANA. 
    
 
3.1.  General Assumptions 
    
   T.38 fax gateways may detect various fax tones (CNG, CED, etc.) or 
   flag sequence (like Preamble) and pass these in the audio RTP 
   streams before they are detected.  Once detected by the DSP, T.38 
   fax gateways switch from audio to fax mode and initiate a T.38 fax 
   packet transmission. 
    
   These best current practices apply with both "Network Gateway" and  
   "Enterprise Gateway". 
    
    
3.2 Legend for Message Flows 
    
   The legend defined [5] also applies in this document.  
   Dashed lines (---) represent control messages that are mandatory to   
   the call scenario. These control messages can be SIP or PSTN 
   signaling. 
   Double dashed lines (===) represent media paths between network 
   elements. 
   Messages with parenthesis around name represent optional control 
   messages. 
   Messages are identified in the Figures as F1, F2, etc.  This 
   references the message details in the table that follows the Figure. 
   Comments in the message details are shown in the following form: 
    
       /* Comments. */

3.3 Internet Fax gateways and fax handling assumptions 
    
   The handling of fax transmission depends on the nature of the 
   gateways.  There are 2 distinct cases: 
         . The Internet fax gateway supports fax communications only. 
   The Internet fax gateway always initiates a SIP call with T.38 SDP 
   capabilities (this is typically the case of Internet Fax Terminals, 
   also called Internet-aware fax terminals or the case of gateways 
   statically configured to support T.38 fax calls only) 
         . The IP telephony gateway supports voice, fax and voice-band 
   date communications.  In this case, the IP telephony gateway 
   initiates a voice call with audio SDP cap, and, upon fax detection, 
   the switch-over to T.38 fax capabilities is triggered. 
   In the rest of this document, we deal with the second case which is 
   more general. 
    
   Three possible ways exist for detecting a fax communication and 
   modifying a SIP session to allow T.38 fax: 
    
   1. On the emitting gateway (the one sending the fax), a CNG tone is 
   detected and triggers the fax channel initiation. However the CNG 
   tone is optional.  
    
   2. On the receiving gateway (the one receiving the fax), a CED tone 
   is generated and triggers the fax channel initiation. The CED tone 
   is also optional.  
      The authors of this document believe this second option is the 
   preferred one and MUST be supported by SIP Internet Fax gateways. 
    
   3. On the receiving gateway, no CED tone is present, so the Preamble 
   flag sequence triggers the fax channel initiation.  The Preamble is 
   always present and follows the CED tone when CED is present.  
      The authors of this document believe this third option should be 
   the method used in the absence of the CED tone. It MUST be supported 
   by SIP implementations. 
    
    
   In conclusion, several conditions can trigger fax detection.  The 
   authors of this document recommend detection of a fax transmission 
   on the receiving side of the fax call by recognizing the CED tone if 
   CED is present or the Preamble flag sequence if and only if CED is 
   not present.  Even if the emitting side detects a fax (CNG tone), it 
   MUST not initiate the switch over.  The receiving side MUST initiate 
   the re-INVITE with proper SDP description to support fax 
   communications. 
    
   If a SIP session starts with audio capabilities, then ôswitchö to 
   fax capabilities, it must switch back to audio mode after fax 
   transmission or it must be terminated. 
    
 
4  T.38 Fax Call (fax detection on receiving side) 
    
  
Mule, et al.                                                         3 

                         SIP T.38 Call Flows             October 2000 
 
 
4.1 Fax transmission 
   This section represents the SIP call flow for a T.38 fax session 
   between 2 Internet telephony gateways or Internet fax terminals. A 
   call starts with audio capabilities, then the session is modified to 
   t38 fax mode (t.38/udptl).  The mechanism for supporting T.38 in SIP 
   & SDP is detailed in T.38 Annex D [8], a temporary document that 
   proposes an amendment to T.38 describing SIP call establishment 
   procedures.  
    
   Scenario: 
   1. A SIP INVITE is sent to the called party requesting a voice 
   connection per RFC2543; our scenario involves 1 SIP proxy. An audio 
   connection is established; 
   2. Upon detection of CED tone or Preamble by the terminating 
   gateway, a second SIP INVITE request is sent to the emitting gateway 
   to modify the parameters of the session to allow a T.38 fax 
   connection. This INVITE request has the same CALL-ID as the existing 
   voice call but a higher Cseq number and an SDP message body 
   detailing T.38 capabilities; 
   3. It is suggested that the voice pipe be muted while the fax 
   session is in progress.  Upon successful acknowledgments, T.38 IFP 
   fax packets are sent/received on different UDP ports than the one 
   used for audio RTP; 
   4. Once the fax transmission is terminated, audio capabilities are 
   ôrestoredö or the call is terminated. 
    
    
4.2. Sequence Diagram 
   In our example, we illustrate the fact that Internet telephony 
   gateways may use multiple network interfaces for signaling and/or 
   media streaming or one network interface with multiple IP addresses.   
   Typically, our example shows: 
      - one interface for SIP signaling  
   (ingress gateway = ift.here.com, egress gateway = iftgw.there.com) 
      - one or multiple interface(s) for media transport: 
   (ingress gateway = iftmg.here.com, egress gateway = iftmg.there.com) 
   A proxy is acting as a pure SIP signaling proxy (ss1.wcom.com).

6. Considerations 
    
   In this section, we log the open items for discussion: 
    
6.1. Level of requirements:  
   The fax detection on receiving side: SHOULD/MUST, are gateways 
   allowed to trigger SIP session modifications on emitting fax side? 
   The authors recommend that T.38 Internet fax gateways MUST trigger  
    
6.2. Negotiation of UDP ports for T.38 transmission 
   When switching to T.38 mode, Internet fax gateways specify a new set 
   of parameters for the media connection in SDP.  Some gateways may 
   choose the UDP/RTP port used in audio mode for UDP/UDPTL/T.38 
   traffic.  Some gateways may choose to open a new UDP port for 
   UDPTL/T.38 fax (and keep the previous UDP/RTP port open for the 
   switch back to audio). 
   SDP provides the mechanism to precisely define in SIP all cases: 
   - if an Internet Fax gateway desires to re-use the UDP/RTP port for 
   UDP/UDPTL/T.38, put 1 ôm=ö line in the re-INVITE. 
          m=image <original_RTP_port> udptl t38 
   - if an Internet Fax gateway desires to release the RTP port and 
   open a new UDP port for T.38:  
          m=image <new_UDP_port> udptl t38 
   - if an Internet Fax gateway desires to keep the RTP port for future 
   use in the session and open a new UDP port for T.38, we need to 
   repeat the RTP/AVP port:  
          m=audio <original_RTP_port> RTP/AVP 0 
          m=image <new_UDP_port> udptl t38 
    
6.3. To Do List: 
   - Add more call flows based on mailing list discussions (glare 
   effect when both sides initiate a switch over) 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
 
   The security mechanisms provided in RFC2543 apply: message 
   authentication can be performed on SIP INVITEs and BYE.
