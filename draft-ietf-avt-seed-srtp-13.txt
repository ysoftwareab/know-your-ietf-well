1. Introduction 

   This document describes the use of the SEED [RFC4269] block cipher 
   algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] 
   for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol 
   (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the control traffic for RTP, the 
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550]. 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED is a Korean National Industrial Association standard and is 
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial 
   services that are operated on wired and wireless communications. 

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed 
   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts 
   since 1998. The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the 
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has a 16-round Feistel structure.  

1.2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Cryptographic Transforms 

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics 
   including mode, key size, weak keys, and block size. The following 
   sections contain descriptions of the relevant characteristics of  
   SEED. 

   SEED does not have any restrictions for modes of operation that are 
   used with this block cipher. We define three modes of running SEED, 
   (1) SEED in Counter Mode, (2) SEED in Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) Mode 
   and (3) SEED in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) Mode. 

2.1. Counter 

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption, which 
   it refers to as AES-CM. SEED counter mode is defined in a similar 
   manner, and is denoted as SEED-CTR. The plaintext inputs to the block 
   cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and the block cipher outputs are 
   processed as in AES-CM. The only difference in the processing is that 
   SEED-CTR uses SEED as the underlying encryption primitive. When SEED-
   CTR is used, it MUST be used only in conjunction with an 
   authentication function. 

2.1.1. Message Authentication/Integrity: HMAC-SHA1 

   HMAC-SHA1 [RFC2104], as defined in section 4.2.1 of [RFC3711], SHALL 
   be the default message authentication code to be used with SEED-CTR. 
   The default session authentication key-length SHALL be 160 bits, the 
   default authentication tag length SHALL be 80 bits, and the 
   SRTP_PREFIX_LENGTH SHALL be zero for HMAC-SHA1. For SRTP, smaller 
   values are NOT RECOMMENDED, but MAY be used after careful 
   consideration of the issues in section 7.5 and 9.5 of [RFC3711].  

2.2. Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode  
   [RFC3610]. In this specification, CCM used with the SEED block  
   cipher is denoted as SEED-CCM. 

   Section 3.3 of [RFC3711] defines procedures to construct or to 
   authenticate and decrypt SRTP packet. The sender performs Step 7 
   before Step 5 and the receiver performs the second half of Step 5 
   (performs verification) after Step 6. This means that authentication 
   is performed on the plaintext rather than the ciphertext. This 
   applies equally to SRTCP. 

   All SRTP packets MUST be authenticated and encrypted. Unlike SRTP, 
   SRTCP packet encryption is optional (but authentication is

Internet-Draft                SEED-SRTP                   June 9, 2009 
    

   mandatory). A sender can select which packets to encrypt, and 
   indicates this choice with a 1-bit encryption flag (located in the 
   leftmost bit of the 32-bit word that contains the SRTCP index). 

      SEED-CCM has two parameters: 

      M   M indicates the size of the authentication tag. In SRTP, a 
          full 80-bit authentication-tag SHOULD be used and 
          implementation of this specification MUST support M values of 
          10 octets. 

      L   L indicates the size of the length field in octets. The number 
          of octets in the nonce MUST be 12, i.e., L is 3. 

      SEED-CCM has four inputs: 

      Key 

         A single key is used to calculate the authentication tag using 
         CBC-MAC and to perform payload encryption using counter mode. 
         SEED only supports a key size of 128 bits. 

      Nonce 

         The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the 
         parameter L. It is 15-L octets. L equals 3 and hence the nonce 
         size equals 12 octets. 

      Plaintext 

         In case of SRTP, the payload of the RTP packet and the RTP 
         padding and RTP pad count field (if the latter two fields are 
         present). 

         In case of SRTCP, when the encryption flag is set to 1, the 
         Encrypted Portion described in Fig.2 of [RFC3711] is treated as 
         plaintext. When the encryption flag is set to 0, the plaintext 
         is zero-length.

      Additional Authentication Data (AAD) 

         In case of SRTP, the header of the RTP packet including 
         contributing source (CSRC) identifier (if present) and the RTP 
         header extension (if present). 

         In case of SRTCP, when the encryption flag is set to 0, the 
         Authentication Portion described in Fig.2 of [RFC3711] is 
         treated as AAD. When the encryption flag is set to 1, the first 
         8-octets, the encryption flag and SRTCP index are treated as 
         AAD. 

   SEED-CCM accepts these four inputs and returns a ciphertext field. 

2.3. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) 

   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both 
   confidentiality and data origin authentication [GCM]. GCM used with 
   the SEED block cipher is denoted as SEED-GCM. 

   SEED-GCM has four inputs: a key, a plaintext, a nonce and an 
   additional authenticated data (AAD) all described in section 2.2. 

   The bit length of the tag, denoted t, is 12, and an authentication 
   tag with a length of 12 octets (96 bits) is used. 

3. Nonce Format for CCM and GCM 

3.1. Nonce for SRTP 

   The nonce for SRTP SHALL be formed in the following way: 

         Nonce = (16 bits of zeroes || SSRC || ROC || SEQ) XOR Salt 

   The 4-octet SSRC and the 2-octet SEQ SHALL be taken from the RTP 
   header. The 4-octet ROC is from the cryptographic context. The 12-
   octet Salt SHALL be produced by the SRTP Key Derivation Function. 

3.2. Nonce for SRTCP 

   The nonce for SRTCP SHALL be formed in the following way: 

         Nonce = (16 bits of zeroes || SSRC || 16 bits of zeroes || 
                  SRTCP index) XOR Salt 

   The 4-octet SSRC SHALL be taken from the RTCP header and The 31-bit 
   SRTCP index (packed zero-filled, right justified into a 4-octet

   field) is from each packet. The 12-octet Salt SHALL be produced by 
   the SRTP Key Derivation Function. 

4. Key Derivation: SEED-CTR PRF 

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines the AES-128 counter mode key 
   derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF". The SEED-CTR 
   PRF is defined in a similar manner, but with each invocation of AES 
   replaced with an invocation of SEED. 

   The currently defined PRF, keyed by the 128-bit master key, has input 
   block size m = 128 and can produce n-bit outputs for n up to 2^23. 
   SEED-PRF_n(k_master, x) SHALL be SEED in Counter Mode as described in 
   section 2.1, applied to key k_master, and IV equal to (x*2^16), and 
   with the output keystream truncated to the n first (left-most) bits. 

5. Mandatory-to-implement Transforms 

   "Mandatory-to-implement" means conformance to the specification, and 
   that Table 1 does not supersede a similar table in Section 5 of 
   [RFC3711]. An RTP implementation that supports SEED, it MUST 
   implement the modes listed in Section 5.

   Table 1: Mandatory-to-implement and optional transforms in SRTP and 
   SRTCP. 

6. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only 
   an exhaustive search for the key. For further security  
   considerations, the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL]. 

   See [RFC3610] and [GCM] for security considerations regarding the CCM 
   and GCM Modes of Operation, respectively. In the context of SRTP, the 
   procedures in [RFC3711] ensure the critical property of non-reuse of 
   counter values.

7. IANA Considerations 

   [RFC4568] defines SRTP "crypto suites". In order to allow SDP to 
   signal the use of the algorithms defined in this document, IANA will 
   register the following crypto suites into the subregistry for SRTP 
   crypto suites under the SRTP transport of the SDP Security 
   Descriptions: 

      srtp-crypto-suite-ext = "SEED_CTR_128_HMAC_SHA1_80"/                       
                              "SEED_128_CCM_80" / 
                              "SEED_128_GCM_96" /
