Abstract

    This document describes a media type (application/rdf+xml) for use
    with the XML serialization of the Resource Description Framework
    (RDF).  RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by
    facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  RDF
    provides common structures that can be used for interoperable data
    exchange and follows the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) design
    principles of interoperability, evolution, and decentralization.

1. Introduction

    RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by
    facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  RDF
    provides common structures that can be used for interoperable data
    exchange and follows the W3C design principles of interoperability,
    evolution, and decentralization.

    While the RDF data model [2] can be serialized in many ways, the W3C
    has defined the RDF/XML syntax [1] to allow RDF to be serialized in
    an XML format.  The application/rdf+xml media type allows RDF
    consumers to identify RDF/XML documents so that they can be processed
    properly.

2. application/rdf+xml Registration

    This is a media type registration as defined in Multipurpose Internet
    Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures [7]

       MIME media type name: application

       MIME subtype name: rdf+xml

       Required parameters: none

       Optional parameters: charset

          Same as charset parameter of application/xml.

       Encoding considerations:

          Same as charset parameter of application/xml.

       Security considerations:

          Security considerations include many of those described in
          section 10 of RFC 3023 [5] and more, due to the semantic nature
          of RDF.  RDF documents may make assertions about anything and
          it is expected that future work with Digital Signature and "Web
          of Trust" will make it more clear how to build secure RDF
          systems.

       Interoperability considerations:

          It is recommended that RDF documents follow the newer RDF/XML
          Syntax Grammar [1] as opposed to the older RDF Model and Syntax
          specification [4].

          RDF is intended to allow common information to be exchanged
          between disparate applications.  A basis for building common
          understanding is provided by a formal semantics [3], and
          applications that use RDF should do so in ways that are
          consistent with this.

       Published specification: see RDF/XML Syntax Grammar [1] and RDF:
       Concepts and Abstract Syntax [2] and the older RDF Model and
       Syntax [4]

       Applications which use this media type:

          RDF is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported
          by a range of Web user agents and authoring tools.

       Additional information:

          Magic number(s): none

             Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently
             identify RDF, RDF documents will have the sequence "http://
             www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" to identify the RDF
             namespace.  This will usually be towards the top of the
             document.

          File extension(s): .rdf

          Macintosh File Type Code(s): "rdf "

          More information may be found on the RDF website: <http://
          www.w3.org/RDF/>

       Intended usage: COMMON

       Author/Change controller:

          The RDF specification is a work product of the World Wide Web
          Consortium.  The W3C and the W3C RDF Core Working Group have
          change control over the specification.

3. Fragment Identifiers

    The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments
    in an RDF document.

    Section 4.1 of the URI specification [6] notes that the semantics of
    a fragment identifier (part of a URI after a "#") is a property of
    the data resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and
    interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type
    of the retrieval result.

    In RDF, the thing identified by a URI with fragment identifier does
    not necessarily bear any particular relationship to the thing
    identified by the URI alone.  This differs from some readings of the
    URI specification [6], so attention is recommended when creating new
    RDF terms which use fragment identifiers.

    More details on RDF's treatment of fragment identifiers can be found
    in the section "Fragment Identifiers" of the RDF Concepts document
    [2].

4. Historical Considerations

    This media type was reserved in RFC 3023 [5], saying:

       RDF documents identified using this MIME type are XML documents
       whose content describes metadata, as defined by [RDF].  As a
       format based on XML, RDF documents SHOULD use the '+xml' suffix
       convention in their MIME content-type identifier.  However, no
       content type has yet been registered for RDF and so this media
       type should not be used until such registration has been
       completed.


5. IANA Considerations

    This document calls for registration of a new MIME content-type,
    according to the registration template in section 2.

6. Acknowledgements

    Thanks to Dan Connolly for writing the first version of this draft
    [9], to Andy Powell for reminding us we needed one, to Marshall Rose
    for his xml2rfc [10] converter, and to Graham Klyne, Jan Grant, and
    Dave Beckett for their helpful comments on early versions of this
    document.
