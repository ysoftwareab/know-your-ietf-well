Abstract

   This document defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol [1] to
   allow mobility management for the interface between a radio network
   and a packet data network in the third generation cdma2000 network.

   Mobile IP requires link layer connectivity between the Mobile Node
   and the Foreign Agent. This draft proposes a protocol for achieving
   this when the physical layer terminates at a point distant from the
   FA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000 networks where
   the physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and the
   FA resides inside a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). The
   PDSN is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating
   the link layer to the Mobile Node. A RNN is responsible for relaying
   the link layer protocol between a Mobile Node and its corresponding
   PDSN.

   The interface between the RNN and the PDSN is called the RP
   interface. This interface requires mobility management for handling
   handoff from one RNN to another without interrupting end to end
   communication. It also requires the support of the link layer
   protocol encapsulation.

   In above figure 1, the PDSN will be responsible for establishing,
   maintaining, and terminating the link layer to the Mobile Node. It
   initiates the authentication, authorization, and accounting for the
   Mobile Node and optionally, securely tunnels to the Home Agent.

   The RNN is responsible for mapping the Mobile Node identifier
   reference to a unique link layer identifier used to communicate with
   the PDSN. RNN validates the Mobile Station for access service and
   manages the physical layer connection to the Mobile Node.


4. Mobile IP Extensions

   This section describes extensions to the Mobile IP protocol for the
   RP interface within the third generation cdma2000 network.

4.1 Registration Request

   In a cdma2000 network, the mobile node initiates a connection by
   sending a call setup indication to the RNN across the radio network.
   When this indication is received by a RNN, a Registration Request
   will be sent from the RNN to the PDSN to setup a new RP session.

   A RNN MUST send a Registration Request with the GRE encapsulation
   and the reverse tunneling bit set. The Home Address field is set to
   zero. The Home Agent field will be assigned to the IP address of the
   PDSN and the Care-of Address field will be assigned to the IP
   address of RNN.

   When a Registration Request is received by a PDSN, the information
   from the Session Specific Extension (see next section) will be used
   to identify a RP session. When a registration is accepted, a GRE
   tunnel will be created for this Mobile Node.

   The fields of the Registration Request message are shown below:

       0                   1                   2                   3

                        the ones described in RFC2002. Specifically,
                        the MN-HA Authentication extension as described
                        in RFC2002 MUST be included along with this

        Length          This is a one octet field and it indicates the
                        length (in bytes) of the extension, NOT
                        including the Type and Length fields.

        Protocol Type
                       This is a two octet field. It indicates the type
                       of the protocol to be tunneled across the RP
                       interface. It is same as the Protocol Type field
                       in the GRE header.

        Key             This is a four octet value assigned by the RNN
                       and inserted in every GRE frame across the RP
                       interface during user data tunneling.

        Reserved       This is a two octet field. It is not used and is
                       set to zero.

        MN Connection ID
                        This is a two octet field and it is used to
                        differentiate the multiple sessions from the
                        same Mobile Node. It is locally unique to a
                        Mobile Node.

        MN ID Type
                        This is a two octet field and it indicates the
                        type of the following Mobile Node ID value.

        MN ID Length
                       This is a one octet field and it indicates the
                       length (in bytes) of the following Mobile Node
                       ID field.

        MN ID           This is the Mobile Node ID, which is globally
                       unique. It is used to uniquely identify a Mobile
                       Node.

   This extension MUST be included in the Registration Request and
   Registration Update (see section 4.5) messages. It will be included
   before the MN-HA Authentication extension in the Registration
   Request message and before the Registration Update Authentication
   Extension in the Registration Update message.

   The MN ID and the MN Connection ID together will uniquely identify a
   Mobile Session.

4.3 Registration Reply

   The Registration Reply will be sent by a PDSN following the
   procedure as described in [1]. The Home Address field will be the

4.4 Registration Update/Acknowledge

   Two new messages are defined to support PDSN initiated RP tunnel
   tear down and to speed up resource reclamation on the RNN.

   The Registration Update message is used for notification of the
   change of the registration associated with a call. It shall be sent
   by the PDSN to the previous RNN when a RNN to RNN handoff happens.

   Both messages are sent with UDP using well-known port number 434.

         131 sending node failed authentication
         133 identification mismatch
         134 poorly formed Registration Update


4.5 Registration Update Authentication Extension

   The Registration Update Authentication extension is used to
   authenticate the Registration Update and Registration Acknowledge
   messages. It has the same format and default algorithm support
   requirements as the authentication extension defined for Mobile IP
   protocol [1], but with a different type (40).  The authenticator
   value is computed from the stream of bytes including the shared
   secret, the UDP payload all prior extensions in their entirety, and
   the type and length of this extension, but not including the
   authenticator field itself nor the UDP header. The secret used for
   computing the authenticator field is shared between the RN and PDSN.
   This extension is required in both Registration Update and
   Registration Acknowledge messages.

4.6 Summary

   The extensions to Mobile IP include enabling the GRE encapsulation
   and reverse tunneling during Registration. A new extension called
   Session Specific Extension is defined and is mandatory in both
   Registration Request and Registration Update messages. The Home
   Address field MUST be set to zero in the Registration Request,
   Registration Reply, Registration Update and Registration Acknowledge
   messages.

   Two new messages (Registration Update/Acknowledge) are defined to
   support the RP session disconnection in order to speed up resource
   reclamation.


5.0 GRE Encapsulation

   GRE encapsulation as described in [3] shall be supported during user
   data transmission. A new protocol type might be required to support
   the link layer protocol defined for the third generation cdma2000
   network. The Key field shall be required and its value shall be same
   as the one from the Session Specific Extension as described above.
   The sequence number may be required, depending on the requirement of
   the protocol encapsulated within the GRE frame.

   During traffic tunneling, the sender will insert the Key value from
   the Registration Request message into the Key field of the GRE
   header. The receiver will use the Key value from the GRE header to
   decide where to forward the user data.

6.0 IANA Considerations

   The numbers for the Mobile IP Session Specific Extension (section
   4.2)and Registration Update Authentication Extension (section 4.5)
   are taken from the numbering space defined for Mobile IP extensions
   defined in RFC 2002 [1] as extended in RFC 2356 [4]. The numbering
   for the extensions SHOULD NOT conflict with values specified in the
   Internet Draft for the Mobile IP Network Address Identifier
   Extension[5], the Internet Draft for Mobile IP Challenge/Response
   Extensions[6] or the Internet Draft for Route Optimization [7]. The
   values specified for Status field, listed in section 4.4, MUST NOT
   conflict with any other code or status values listed in RFC 2002[1],
   RFC2344[2], or RFC2356[4], or the above mentioned Internet Drafts
   [5], [6] and [7]. They are to be taken from the space of error
   values conventionally associated with rejection by the home agent
   (i.e. 128-255).

7.0 Security Considerations

   The protocol presented in this draft is designed for use over a
   protected, private network between RNN and PDSN. Pre-arranged
   security associations in the style of Mobile IPv4 are assumed to
   exist among every (RNN, PDSN) pair that will form an RP connection.
   Also, it is assumed that the session specific information is
   authenticated by means outside the scope of this draft.

   Several potential vulnerabilities exist if these assumptions are not
   met. First, if the network connecting the RNN and PDSN is accessible
   to an attacker, user traffic may be intercepted and/or spoofed if
   there are no other end-to-end security mechanisms in place. Second,
   the Mobile IP control messages must be authenticated, to prevent
   tunnel setup and tear down by unauthorized parties. Mobile IP
   Authentication Extensions are used to provide this additional
   protection for control messages. Finally, if session specific
   information is not authenticated, a denial-of-service attack is
   possible if a RNN unknowingly sends a registration request to the
   PDSN with a spoofed session specific extension. The PDSN would then
   send an explicit tunnel tear down to the previous RNN, causing user
   traffic to be misdirected to the new RNN. This would cause a loss of
   service and possibly interception of traffic, depending on what
   other security measures are in place.
