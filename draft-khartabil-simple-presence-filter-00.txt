Abstract 
    
   The Presence event package for the SIP events framework describes 
   the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions 
   and notifications of user presence. The document details how 
   watchers can subscribe for notifications of all authorised and 
   available presence information about the presentity. The document 
   does not describe a mechanism of how filtering of presence 
   information can be achieved. 
     
   This document defines a presence filter package for the Event 
   Notification Filtering Architecture. The package provides the 
   mechanism whereby a watcher can specify the presence event filtering

1.0 Terminology 
    
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED" "MAY", 
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [12]. 
    
   The document uses the terms as defined in [1], [2] and [3]. 
    
2.0 Introduction 
    
   User presence is defined as the ability to express willingness and 
   ability of a user to communicate with other users on the network 
   [2]. 
    
   SIP event notification is described in [4]. It defines a general 
   framework for sending subscriptions and receiving notifications in 
   SIP based systems.  It introduces the concept of event packages, 
   which are concrete applications of the general event framework to a 
   specific usage of events.  An event package for user presence is 
   defined in [2]. 
    
   Filtering is a mechanism for controlling the content of event 
   notifications [5]. Additionally the subscriber may specify the rules 
   for when a notification should be sent to it.   
    
   The filtering mechanism is expected to be particularly valuable to 
   users of mobile wireless access devices. The characteristics of the 
   devices typically include high latency, low bandwidth, low data 
   processing capabilities, small display, and limited battery power. 
   Such devices can benefit from the ability to filter the amount of 
   information generated at the source of the event notification.  
    
   It is stated in [2] that the notifier (Presence Agent) may send a 
   NOTIFY at any time, but typically it is sent when the state of the 
   presentity changes. It also states that the notifications would 
   contain the complete and current presence state of the presentity 
   authorized for a certain subscriber to see. The format of such 
   presence information is named Presence Information Data Format 
   (PIDF), as defined in [3]. 
    
   This document presents a mechanism for the filtering of the PIDF 
   based presence information. The document specifically describes how 
   the subscriber is able to both limit the content and indicate more 
   specifically the prefered content of the notifications using XML and 
   Xpath [15] technologies. It also describes how the presence agent 
   (PA) functions when generating notifications by taking into account 
   filters, authorisation rules and default functionality of the 
   presence service. 
    
   The presence specific filtering solution presented here is 
   compatible with the Presence Event Package [2].

   Requirements for the Presence filter criteria can be found from two 
   drafts: 
    
   The 3GPP Presence requirements document [14] sets the following 
   requirement: "It must be possible for a watcher to select certain 
   elements from the presence information that he wants (or does not 
   want) to receive in notifications for." 
    
   The filter requirements draft [5] presents the following case: "A 
   watcher wishes to get to know presentity's availability and 
   willingness for messaging (e.g. IM and MMS)." 
    
   Events Notification RFC [4] and the SIMPLE working group both 
   identify filtering work as potential work. 
    
2.1 Motivation For Using XML 
    
   When trying to select the schema and protocol for defining the 
   filter criteria, it can be found that there are several alternatives 
   available. The best practice is to modularise the problem and work 
   on smaller modules (the protocol and the filter information schema). 
   The selection of the schema for defining the filter criteria 
   requires a readable syntax with enough flexibility to define the 
   semantics. 
    
   Among the multiple possibilities (i.e. XML, Perl, TCL, etc), XML 
   provides a generic framework where a schema for the filter logic 
   including a namespace allowing the definition of the filter 
   criteria. Thus, an XML schema provides an extensible mechanism where 
   the logic required for the filtering functionality can be built. XML 
   provides extensibility based on "namespaces" associated with a 
   globally unique URI. 
    
   The XML also enables the use of Xpath [15] for referencing items in 
   an XML document (which is in the case of Presence in the format of 
   the PIDF). 
   In addition, by using XML the need for reliance on the transport 
   protocol in order to interpret the filter criteria can be 
   eliminated.  
    
    
3.0 Presence Package Specific Filters 
    
   This section describes the technologies and information needed to 
   provide a filter specification relevant to presence filtering. 
    
    
3.1 Package ID  
    
   The package ID is æpresenceÆ or ôpresence.listö. This ID is carried 
   in the event-header of the SUBSCRIBE as well as within the XML 
   document carrying filter criteria. 
 
Khartabil, et. al.                                            [Page 4] 

Internet Draft        Congestion Safety and C-I             July 2002 
 
 
    
    
3.3 Transport mechanism 
    
   Transportation of the filter criteria to the server is achieved by 
   inserting the filter XML document in the body of a SIP SUBSCRIBE 
   request. Alternatively, the document can be uploaded to the server 
   using a transport specific for data manipulation. 
    
3.4 Structure of XML-Encoded Presence Filter Criteria 
    
   Presence Filter Criteria is an XML document [7] that MUST be well-
   formed and SHOULD be valid. Presence Filter Criteria XML documents 
   MUST have the XML declaration and it SHOULD contain an encoding 
   declaration in the XML declaration e.g. "<?XML version='1.0' 
      encoding='UTF-8'?>". This specification makes use of XML 
   namespaces for identifying the XML schema of the Presence Filter 
   Criteria documents and document fragments.  
    
   The namespace identifier for elements defined by this specification 
   is a URN [8], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [9] 
   and extended by [10]. This urn is: 
    
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-pres-filter+xml. 
    
   This namespace declaration indicates the namespace on which the 
   filter criteria are based on. 
    
3.4.1 The <ev-filter-set> Root Element 
    
   The root element of the filter criteria is <ev-filter-set>. The <ev-
   filter-set> MAY have a 'pkgdef' attribute that defines the 
   'Presence' or 'presence.list' as package for the filter criteria. 
    
   The <ev-filter-set> root element MUST contain the namespace 
   mentioned above. This element MUST contain one or more <ev-filter> 
   elements.    
    
3.4.2 The <ev-filter> Element 
    
   The <ev-filter> element is used to specify the content of an 
   individual filter.  
    
   <ev-filter> MUST have an 'id' attribute. The value of the 'id' 
   attribute MUST be unique within the <ev-filter-set> root element. 
   <ev-filter> MUST have an 'uri' attribute. The value of the 'uri' 
   attribute is the URI of the PRESENTITY or URI of the set of 
   presentities from whom presence information is requested. 
    
   The URI of the PRESENTITY is useful in cases where the ælistÆ 
   template package [6] is used with æpresenceÆ package and different 
   filter criteria are defined for one or more members of the 
   presence.list. 
 
Khartabil, et. al.                                            [Page 5] 

Internet Draft        Congestion Safety and C-I             July 2002 
 
 
    
   The <ev-filter> element MUST contain a <what> element. 
    
   OPEN ISSUE: The solution for defining conditions when notifications 
   are triggered is defined in future versions of this document. 
    
    
3.4.3 The <what> Element 
    
   The <what> element is used to specify the content to be delivered to 
   the WATCHER. It does not specify the exact content but rules that 
   are used to construct that information.  
    
   The <what> element MUST contain the 'report' attribute. The value of 
   the 'report' is either 'default' or 'list-selected'. The 'default' 
   value means that also all the values of the selected PIDF XML 
   attributes and elements are delivered. The 'list-selected' means 
   that only the selected items are delivered. Note that all the 
   namespace definitions related to the delivered content are always 
   delivered. 
    
    
3.4.3.1 Defining the delivered content 
    
   It must be possible in the filter criteria to be able to select 
   presence attributes and/or tuples of the default presence 
   information format [3]. It must also be possible to reference 
   presence information of any extensions as the PIDF allows extensions 
   to be defined as own namespaces. 
    
   A general way to reference any items (PIDF XML elements and 
   attributes) of the presence information is to be specified. The 
   referencing mechanism should support hierarchy of the items since 
   there may be several nested PIDF XML elements and attributes in the 
   presence information. 
    
   The preferred presence information is indicated using the 
   capabilities of XPath [15]. The XPath clause is stated in the value 
   of the <What> element. The items addressed with the XPath are 
   indicated with the expanded name which means that the URI of the 
   presence information namespace is included in addition to the 
   reference to the presence information item. 
    
 
5.0 Client and server operation 
    
5.1 Client Operation 
    
5.1.1 SUBSCRIBE Bodies 
    
   SIP entities compliant with this specification MUST support content-
   type æapplication/simple-pres-filter+xmlÆ.

5.1.2 Subscriber Generating SUBSCRIBE requests 
    
   This section presents additional functionalities required from the 
   subscriber when filters are used in SUBSCRIBE requests bodies. 
   Normal operations as defined in [2] are then followed. 
    
   As defined in [2], a SUBSCRIBE for presence MAY contain a body. This 
   body, as defined in this document, would serve the purpose of 
   filtering. Honouring of these filters is at the policy discretion of 
   the PA. 
    
   No content in the body of a SUBSCRIBE indicates to the PA that no 
   filter is being requested; so that the PA is instructed to send all 
   NOTIFY requests including presence states that its own policy 
   allows. 
    
   If present, the body MUST be of MIME-Type æapplication/simple-pres-
   filter+xmlÆ. 
    
5.1.2.1 To-Header vs. Filter URI 
    
   The Event package "presence" in Event-header of the SUBSCRIBE 
   request specifies that the filter rules apply to the presence 
   information of the URI indicated in filter, or the URI present in 
   the To-header if no URI is indicated in the filter. 
    
   If the template package ôlistö is used with ôpresenceö in the 
   SUBSCRIBE, and no presentity URI is indicated by the filter, the 
   filter rules apply to all the URIs that result from a lookup, by the 
   Presence Agent, on the URI present in the To-header if no presentity 
   URI is indicated in the filter. 
    
   If the template package ôlistö is used with ôpresenceö in the 
   SUBSCRIBE, and the URI indicated by the filter in a presence list 
   URI, the filter rules apply to all the URIs that result from a 
   lookup, by the Presence Agent, on the URI in the filter. 
    
   If the template package ôlistö is used with ôpresenceö in the 
   SUBSCRIBE, and the presentity URI indicated by the filter in for one 
   presentity whoÆs URI is one of the URIs that result from a lookup, 
   by the PA, on the URI in the To-header, the filter rules apply to 
   that particular presentity. All other presence documents sent to the 
   rest of the presentities are not affected by the filter. For 
   example, if the To-header in a SUBSCRIBE has the URI 
   sip:mybuddies@mydomain.com, and the URI in the filter is 
   sip:bob@otherdomain.com, the filter only applied to 
   bob@otherdomain.com. 
    
   If the template package ôlistö is used with ôpresenceö in the 
   SUBSCRIBE, and the presentity URI indicated by the filter in for one 
   presentity whoÆs URI is NOT one of the URIs that result from a 
   lookup, by the PA, on the URI in the To-header, the filter rules do 
   not apply to that any particular presentity and are ignored. All 
 
Khartabil, et. al.                                            [Page 7] 

Internet Draft        Congestion Safety and C-I             July 2002 
 
 
   presence documents sent to the presentities are not affected by the 
   filter. 
    
   Multiple filter criteria MAY be included in one SUBSCRIBE. This is 
   achieved by including multiple <ev-filter> elements. 
    
   A SUBSCRIBE request destined to a presence list MAY include multiple 
   filter criteria specific to individual presentities in that presence 
   list. This is achieved by including multiple <ev-filter> elements 
   with differing URIs for presentities in each of those elements. This 
   presentity specific filter overrides any presence list specific 
   filter, if any. Presence list specific filter may or may not include 
   a URI. 
    
    
    
    
5.1.2.2 Changing The Filter Criteria Within A Dialog 
 
   The client MAY reset or change the filter criteria by re-issuing a 
   new SUBSCRIBE request within the existing dialog. The SUBSCRIBE 
   provides the "replace" semantics. This means that all filters are 
   replaced. A SUBSCRIBE within the exiting dialogs that does not 
   contain a filter is assumed to be removing all filter criteria. 
    
   As mentioend earlier, If the template package ôlistö is used with 
   ôpresenceö in the SUBSCRIBE, the rules apply to all the URIs that 
   result from a lookup, by the Presence Agent, on the URI in the 
   filter criteria. A watcher may override a filter for an individual 
   presentity, that is part of the presence list subscribed to earlier, 
   by issuing a new SUBSCRIBE within the existing dialog. The new 
   filter includes 2 <ev-filter> elemets, one for that presentity who 
   filter criteria needs changing, and the other for the presence list 
   (to avoid the replacement of the original filter criteria). 
    
    
5.1.2.3 Subscriber Interpreting SIP responses 
    
   The SUBSCRIBE request will be confirmed with a final response. 200-
   class responses indicate that the subscription has been accepted, 
   and that a NOTIFY will be sent immediately. A 200 response indicates 
   that the subscription has been accepted, the user is authorized to 
   subscribe to presence and that the filter is accepted.  A 202 
   response merely indicates that the subscription has been understood, 
   the content type has been accepted, and that authorization may or 
   may not have been granted. A 202 response also indicates that the 
   filter has not been accepted yet. The acceptation of the filter MAY 
   arrive in a subsequent NOTIFY. 
    
   Non-200 class final responses indicate that no subscription or 
   dialog has been created, and no subsequent NOTIFY message will be 
   sent.  All non-200 class responses have the same meanings and 
   handling as described in RFC 3261 [11] and RFC 3265[4]. 
 
Khartabil, et. al.                                            [Page 8] 

Internet Draft        Congestion Safety and C-I             July 2002 
 
 
   Specifically, a 415 response indicates that the MIME-type 
   æapplication/simple-pres-filter+xmlÆ is not understood by the 
   server. A 488 response indicates that the content (filter) is 
   understood but some aspects of it were either not understood or not 
   accepted. 
    
    
5.1.3 Subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests 
    
   If a 2xx response was returned for the SUBSCRIBE, the NOTIFY that 
   follows MAY contain a body that describes the presence state of the 
   resource after the filter has been applied. 
    
   If the NOTIFY indicates that a subscription has been terminated [4], 
   the subscription is assumed to be terminated. Behaviour in such 
   events is also described in [4]. 
    
   If the subscription is indicated as active, NOTIFY requests are 
   handled as described in [2] and [4].  
    
5.2 Server Operation 
    
5.2.1 NOTIFY Bodies 
    
   SIP entities compliant with this specification MUST support content-
   type æapplication/simple-pres-filter+xmlÆ. 
    
5.2.2 Notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests 
    
   This section present addition functionalities required from the 
   notifier when filters are used in SUBSCRIBE requests bodies. Normal 
   operations as defined in [2] are then followed. 
    
   If 2 <ev-filter> elements address the same presentity, 488 error 
   response is returned. 
    
   The presence agent will examine the content-type header and will 
   return a 415 response if it does not understand content-type 
   æapplication/simple-pres-filter+xmlÆ. 
    
   If the presence agent accepts the content-type, it then starts 
   parsing the body. It returns a 488 response if the body is 
   understood but some aspects of the contents (filter) were not 
   understood and accepted. A warning header in the response may give a 
   better indication why the filters are not supported.  
    
    
   A 200-class responses indicate that the subscription has been 
   accepted, and that a NOTIFY will be sent immediately. A 200 response 
   indicates that the subscription has been accepted, the user is 
   authorized to subscribe to presence and that the filter is accepted.  
   A 202 response merely indicates that the subscription has been 
   understood, and that authorization may or may not have been granted. 
 
Khartabil, et. al.                                            [Page 9] 

Internet Draft        Congestion Safety and C-I             July 2002 
 
 
   A 202 response also indicates that the filter has not been accepted 
   yet. The acceptation of the filter MAY arrive in a subsequent 
   NOTIFY. 
    
5.2.2 Notifier Generation of NOTIFY requests 
    
   Upon receiving the SUBSCRIBE with the filtering rules, the Presence 
   Agent SHOULD retain the filter as long as the subscription persists. 
   The filter SHOULD persist as long as the subscription is active. The 
   filter MAY be incorporated within an existing subscription (an 
   active dialog) by sending a re-SUBSCRIBE that includes the filter in 
   the body. 
    
   If the response sent to the SUBSCRIBE was a 202, and the 202 was 
   chosen because the filter could not be accepted in time, the NOTIFY 
   MAY be used to terminate the subscription if the filter was not 
   found acceptable. 
    
   As described in [2], the NOTIFY message MAY contain a body that 
   describes the presence state of the resource. This body is in a 
   format listed in the Accept header of the SUBSCRIBE, or the presence 
   specific default æapplication/cpim-pidf+xmlÆ if the Accept header is 
   omitted. 
    
5.2.2.1 Generating NOTIFY Contents 
    
   The input to the filter is a PIDF document [3] derived according to 
   the normal functionality defined in [2]. 
    
   The content is filtered according to the XPath expression. The XPath 
   expression indicates the delivered PIDF XML elements and/or 
   attributes. Prefixes of the namespaces of the items of the PIDF XML 
   document to be filtered must be expanded before applying the filter 
   to the items.   
    
   The 'report' attribute indicates whether the values of the selected 
   items are delivered or not. If the value of the æreportÆ is "only-
   selected" the XPath expression directly states the delivered 
   content. In case the value of the 'report' is "default" all the 
   values and attributes of the selected elements are delivered. In 
   addition to the selected contents also the namespaces of all the 
   selected presence information items are conveyed. 
    
    
   5.2.3 Handling of abnormal cases 
    
   In case of an unvalid filter definition û the filter XML document is 
   not aligned with the filter XML schema, the presence agent rejects 
   the SUBSCRIBE request with a 488. If the subscription was accepted 
   with a 202 response and the filter is being evaluated after that, a 
   NOTIFY with a subscription-state of terminated is sent. An event-
   reason-value of ôbadfilterö MAY be included. 
    
 
Khartabil, et. al.                                           [Page 10]

   The above paragraph introduces an extension to the event-reason-
   value of subexp-params. The value, as shown above, is ôbadfilterö. 
    
   In case of an errorneous XPath clause in the filter definition the 
   presence agent either ignores the filter definition or terminates 
   the subscription. 
    
   In case of indication of empty content by the XPath clause the 
   presence agent functions according to the normal procedure for the 
   content filtering described in this document. 
    
6.0 IANA Considerations 
    
   A new content type "application/simple-pres-filter+xml" is defined 
   to represent an XML MIME for the filter criteria of Presence. 
    
   A new event-reason-value ôbadfilterö is defined to represent a the 
   event where a filter is not well formed and not accpeted. 
    
   This specification follows the guidelines of RFC3023 [12]. 
    
   OPEN ISSUE: IANA registration template must be added later. 
    
(Note/Reminder: We must add IANA registration template for this) 
    
    
7.0 Examples  
    
   This chapter describes two use cases where the presence information 
   filtering solution is utilised. In the first use case the watcher is 
   intrested in getting messaging specific information of a certain 
   presentity. In the second use case the watcher is intrested in 
   getting information about the communication means and contact 
   addresses the presentity is currently available for communication 
   on. 
    
   Below is the Presentity's presence information in PIDF. It includes 
   two tuples: one for the instant messaging and another for the voice 
   related information.

7.1 Subscriber requests messaging related information 
    
   The subscriber initiates a subscription to the presentity's 
   messaging (MMS, IM and SMS) related presence information. The 
   subscription includes the content limiting filter. 
    
   The filtered content is indicated with the Xpath expression. This 
   Xpath expression selects all the upper, lower and paraller level 
   PIDF XML elements that match the criteria. That criteria are: 
   Description elements whoÆs value begins with "MMS", "SMS" or "IM". 
   The 'default' value of the report attribute states that also the 
   PIDF XML attributes related to the selected PIDF XML elements and 
   values of the selected PIDF XML elements are requested to be 
   included. 
    
   In this case, the notification includes the contents of the tuple 
   that has the value "IM" in its callerprefs element's description 
   sub-element.

7.2 Subscriber fetches information about "open" communication means 
    
   The subscriber makes a subscription to the presentity's available 
   communication means. The subscription includes the content limiting 
   filter.  
    
   The filtered content is indicated with the Xpath expression. This 
   Xpath expression selects all the upper, lower and paraller level 
   PIDF XML elements that match the criteria. That criteria are: the 
   <basic> element's value is "Open". There is also need to indicate 
   that only the tuples which have contact address information are 
   selected. The 'default' value of the report attribute states that

   also the PIDF XML attributes related to the selected PIDF XML 
   elements and values of the selected PIDF XML elements are requested 
   to be included. 
    
   In this case the notification returns the contents of the tuple that 
   has value is "open" û the voice related information in its status 
   element's basic sub-element.

9.0 Security Requirements 
    
   The presence of filters in the body in a SIP message has a 
   significant effect on the ways in which the request is handled at a 
   server. As a result, it is especially important that messages 
   containing this extension be authenticated and authorized. 
    
   Processing of requests and looking up filter criteria requires set 
   operations and searches, which can require some amount of 
   computation. This enables a DOS attack whereby a user can send 
 
Khartabil, et. al.                                           [Page 16] 

Internet Draft        Congestion Safety and C-I             July 2002 
 
 
   requests with substantial numbers messages with large contents, in 
   the hopes of overloading the server. To counter this, the server 
   SHOULD only allow filters with no more than about 20 rules. 
    
   Requests can reveal sensitive information about a UAÆs capabilities. 
   If this information is sensitive, it SHOULD be encrypted using SIP 
   S/MIME capabilities. 
    
   All presence related security measures discussed in [2] MUST be 
   followed.
