 Generic Application Programming Interface (API) for Sliding Window FEC
                                 Codes
                  draft-roca-nwcrg-generic-fec-api-01

Abstract

   This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface
   (API) for sliding window FEC codes.  This API is meant to be
   compatible with any sliding window FEC code.  It defines the core
   procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e.,
   implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer
   aspects that are the responsibility of the application or protocol
   making use of the codec.  As a consequence, this is not an API for a
   FEC Scheme since certain mechanisms that must be defined by any FEC
   Scheme (e.g., signalling and FEC Payload IDs) are the responsibility
   of the caller instead of being addressed by the codec.  A goal of
   this document is to pave the way for a future open-source
   implementation of such codes, another goal is to simplify the
   development of content delivery protocols that rely on sliding window
   FEC codes for robust transmissions.

1.  Introduction

   Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) codes are a key element of
   communication systems, used to efficiently recover from packet losses
   during content delivery sessions.  Among the FEC codes working at the
   network and higher layers, one can broadly distinguish block codes
   and sliding window codes.  Block FEC codes require the data flow
   coming from the application to be segmented into blocks of a
   predefined maximum size, before generating a certain number of repair
   packets.  With the second type of FEC codes, an encoding window
   continuously slides over the set of source data and repair packets
   are generated at any time by computing for instance a linear
   combination of data present in the encoding window.  This fondamental
   difference seriously impacts the way they can be used by a content
   delivery protocol or application.

   This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface
   (API) for sliding window FEC codes.  This API is meant to be usable
   by any sliding window FEC code and FEC Scheme independently of the
   protocol that may rely on it.  This API defines the core procedures
   and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the
   FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the
   responsibility of the application making use of the codec.

   leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the
   application making use of the codec.  For instance, those restricted
   to end-to-end use-cases as well as those compatible with in-network
   re-encoding use-cases.  Additionaly, this API is not impacted by the
   intra-flow versus inter-flow nature of the use-case, nor is it
   impacted by the single-path versus multi-paths nature of the use-
   case, since those are usage considerations under the responsibility
   of the caller.

   A goal of this document is to pave the way for a future open-source
   implementation of such codes.

3.  AL-FEC Codes and Mechanisms Considered by the Generic API

   This generic FEC API is meant to be used with:

   o  sliding window codes, that manage an encoding window (of fixed or
      variable size) that slides over the set of source symbols at the
      sender.  On the opposite, block codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, LDPC,
      Raptor(Q)) are out of scope;
   o  codes that are restricted to use-cases that involve a single
      encoding point and a single decoding point (i.e., FEC operations
      are carried out either within the end-hosts or middle-boxes), as
      well as codes that can be used with use-cases that involve in-
      network re-coding operations;
   o  use-cases that are limited to an intra-flow coding (simple case),
      as well as use-cases that involve inter-flow coding.  This second
      case is more complex to address (e.g., with questions such as how
      to identify a packet of a flow?) however this is the
      responsibility of the application or protocol using this codec and
      not the codec itself.  This aspect is therefore transparent to the
      API;
   o  use-cases that are limited to single-path communications and use-
      cases that consider multi-path communications.  Here also this is
      a usage consideration that is transparent to the API;
   o  use-cases that involve a dynamic adaptation of the codec
      parameters (e.g., its code rate because the communication path
      losses is known thanks to feedbacks and an appropriate strategy
      can be defined);
   o  fixed code rate or not FEC codes, including rateless codes where
      the number of repair symbols that can be generated is huge (in
      theory illimited);
   o  ideal (MDS) or non ideal (non-MDS) codes.  However most of the
      time, sliding window codes are non-ideal codes, meaning that
      slightly more than l repair symbols may be required to recover all
      the l lost source symbols;

   A key question is to determine what mechanisms are included in the
   codec and what mechanisms are left to the responsibility of the
   caller (i.e., an application or a protocol making use of this codec).
   More precisely, an FEC Scheme (such as the RLC FEC Scheme [RLC] in
   case of FECFRAME [fecframe-ext]) defines all the internal code
   details in order to enable interoperable implementations, but also
   signaling considerations that are essential to use them in a specific
   context.

3.1.  Mechanisms Considered or Ignored by the API

   Applying FEC in a given use-case to improve robustness involves many
   mechanisms.  However they are not all the responsibility of the codec
   and can be instead implemented within the application or protocol
   that uses the codec.  For instance the following mechanisms are
   considered out of scope of the API, being implemented by the caller,
   without any impact on the codec:

   o  code rate adjusment (e.g., thanks to communication path
      experienced loss feedback);
   o  signaling header creation / parsing (TBC, see discussion below);
   o  packet management;
   o  packet transmission / reception;
   o  tunnel management (if any);
   o  congestion control;
   o  selective ACK creation / parsing;
   o  memory management;

   The following mechanisms are within scope of the API:

   o  session management (sender and receiver);
   o  encoding window management (sender and receiver): XXX: TO BE
      DISCUSSED;
   o  set/get/compute coding coefficient (sender and receiver);
   o  build coded symbol (sender);
   o  decode with received source or repair symbol (receiver);

4.  Generic API Proposal

A.3.  Cedric API proposal

   For DRAGONCAST/DragonNet/GardiNet (<https://gitlab.inria.fr/GardiNet/
   liblc/>):

   o  an API could be globally pretty similar;
   o  there is a maintained set of symbols of the "codec" where online
      Gaussian Elimination is performed.  But this same set, is used to
      also re-code packets for generation.  For this to work, one uses
      as pivot the highest index (instead of the lowest in standard
      RREF), in order to avoid adding symbols with higher indices in the
      decoding process.
   o  another set of differences would be that the protocol has more
      control over the coding process than our current codec proposal.
      The reason is that DRAGONCAST (re)codes for several neighbors, and
      in such scenario, there is no "obvious" decision that can be made,
      for instance:

      *  which source symbols (indices) should be present in a generated
         packet: -> tradeoff: helping the maximum number of nodes
         (emphasis on "new" undecoded source symbol indices) -vs-
         helping the neighbor which is the most late in the decoding
         process (emphasis on "old" source symbols)
      *  which symbols should be kept in the decoding process (or
         dropped): -> tradeoff: helping coding by keeping old symbols
         (be able to generate symbols for late neighbors) vs keeping up
         with decoding (and never throwing away a new symbol with high
         indices).  (I.  Amdouni discussed such issues in
         <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amdouni-nwcrg-cisew-00> for
         instance).
   o  In the current implementation, the packet generation process is
      done in the protocol which directly "peeks" in the set of symbols
      in the codec, and creates a linear combination with the ones that
      suits it.
   o  Technically the callbacks from the "codec" are:

      *  notification of a source symbol is decoded;
      *  notification that the set of symbols is full (protocol can
         remove symbols it sees fits, especially decoded symbols);
      *  for the "over-the-air" reflashing application, the codec can
         ask the protocol if an already removed source symbol is
         available (on the assumption that it has been written somewhere
         else);
