Abstract 

   This document gives a short high-level overview of several
   practical experiments performed with mobile networks using Mobile
   IPv6-based NEMO extensions in the context of the IST OverDRiVE
   project.  Laboratory experiments include simple and nested mobile
   networks in a pure IPv6 environment while "field" experiments
   demonstrated continuous IPv6 vehicular connectivity over two
   publicly deployed IPv4 networks: 2.5G (GPRS) and Wireless LAN
   802.11b deployed around and inside a metropolitan area.

1. IST OverDRiVE Project

  Work Package 3 of the European research project OverDRiVE [3] aims
  at developing IPv6 protocol mechanisms to support mobility of hosts,
  as well as of networks, that are deployed in vehicular
  environments. The scenarios envision that future vehicular
  environments in trains, ships or vehicles provide on-line
  information to the driver and passengers; provide even access to the
  vehicular communication components from the outside world
  (e.g. allow for software downloads be pushed to car computers). All
  electronic devices deployed in a vehicle (PCs, head screens, engine
  computers and sensors) are connected together with IPv6 protocols,
  and to the IPv6 Internet; the connection is realized either directly
  or through other IPv4 tunneling and gatewaying means.

  The project has defined a set of scenarios which should be supported
  by a mobility (and security) solution [8]. The following two major
  characteristics are valid for all scenarios:

    - Session continuity while changing the point of attachment to the
      Internet.

    - Reachability of the mobile nodes regardless of the current point
      of attachment.

  Thus, several functional scenarios become relevant:

    - Moving of an Intra-Vehicular Area Network (IVAN): the IVAN moves
      homogeneously (network entities stay together) using a mobile
      router to provide the Internet connectivity for nodes within the
      IVAN.

    - Moving into an IVAN with a mobile device. The mobile host moves
      into an IVAN and changes its WMAN connection to a WLAN
      connection, or its UMTS connection to a Bluetooth connection.

Internet Draft           OverDRiVE Experiments             23 June 2003

    - Moving within an IVAN: in a larger IVAN (e.g. in a train)
      topological hierarchies might be used, involving more than one
      fixed (with respect to IVAN) or mobile router. Mobile nodes can
      move around inside the IVAN connecting to the appropriate access
      router inside the IVAN.

2. Laboratory Experiments

  Several laboratory experiments in a pure IPv6 network were performed
  with mobile hosts and mobile networks.  The correspondent nodes used
  were local streaming servers and other servers connected on other
  parts of the worldwide IPv6 Internet.  In some scenarios more than
  one Local Fixed Node and one Correspondent Node were used; for
  example, in some scenarios there is an additional Mobile Host, or
  there are two mobile networks each hosting a Local Fixed Node.
  During all experiments, the mobility management messaging was not
  interrupting the end-to-end communication between these entities,
  even if several changes in Care-of Address were occuring.  The
  end-t-end communications were happening between the LFN and the CN,
  or between two LFN's, or between one MH and one LFN, or between one
  MH and one CN.

  A simple mobile network is composed of one Mobile Router and one
  Local Fixed Node, see Figure 1.  The mobile network is initially
  attached at home and moves subsequently to Access Router AR1 and
  AR2.

  Figure 2 depicts another setting with one Mobile Router, one Mobile
  Host, same Home Agent.  In a first scenario, the mobile network
  starts at home and then moves under AR1 and AR2.  The Mobile Host
  stays at home.

  Related to the same figure, another scenario, the mobile network and
  the mobile hosts are first placed at home and then the mobile host
  moves under the mobile network.  Subsequently the mobile network
  moves together with the mobile host under AR1 and AR2.

  And still with the same figure, yet another scenario; everything is
  at home, then MH moves under AR1, then the mobile network moves too
  under AR1; then MH moves towards the mobile network and, finally,
  the mobile network moves to AR2.

  link.

  In other experiments there were two Home Agents and two Mobile
  Routers (one Home Agent for one mobile network), but on different

3. "Field" Experiments

  "Field" experiments were performed in a typical deployment of
  wireless networks.  The home network was provided by Motorola Labs
  in Paris.  The access networks include IPv4 networks deployed by
  three operators operators (Bouygues Telecom and Orange in France,
  and TMN in Portugal).  Another access network (Wixos) offers
  Wireless LAN 802.11b connectivity and is experimentally being
  deployed in a large metropolitan area.  All these access networks
  are outside the scope of the IST OverDRiVE project and were used in
  a completely transparent manner.

3.2 Mobile Network

  An OverDRiVE Mobile Network, sometimes referred to as an 'IVAN' in
  the project deliverables is an enhancement of a mobile network that
  is defined in [7].  Some of the extensions include access control
  mechanisms as well as inclusion of special entities named "Front
  Boxes".  The segment made of a Mobile Router and a Local Fixed Node
  exclusively runs IPv6 protocols (no IPv4 at all).  All connections
  between all entities in the experimental Mobile Network are wireless
  connections (there is not any form of Ethernet cable).

  A mobile network that was used during the "field" experiments
  included a laptop Mobile Router and a laptop Local Fixed Nodes, as
  well as several Front Boxes.

  Front boxes are entities connected to the Mobile Router to
  differentiate between mobility management tasks and particular link
  layer/tunnelling functionalities. For example, a GPRS Front Box
  establishes a GPRS connection (i.e. establishes a PPPv4 connection
  to the GPRS SGSN), configures an IPv4 interface and establishes a
  tunnel through a NAT box to an IPv6 network.  When the PPP
  connection is torn down (for example when a vehicle enters a
  non-covered area, such as a tunnel) this exception is local to the
  Front Box and does force a interface and associated routes to
  disappear on the Mobile Router. Firstly, this separate behaviour
  offers deterministic means of diagnostic and evaluation. Secondly,
  this allows the conveyance of IPv6 packet (e.g. Router
  Advertisements) over various publicly available wireless network
  towards the Mobile Router, thus measurements and tests in real life
  environments can be performed.

  The Wireless LAN Front Box offers a similar service when a Wireless
  LAN Access Network is used.

  Similarly, the within the OverDRiVE project the develodevelopment of
  a ps a DVB-T Front Box is in progress. This work is performed in
  Work Package 2 of the project.

  As mentioned earlier, the Front Boxes offer services of traversing
  NAT boxes.  Since each Front Box connects to a private IPv4 address
  space, a special mechanism for NAT traversal is used that includes
  "opening" of tunnels as well as maintaining "state" in the NAT boxes
  with periodic UDP packets.  Once UDPv4 tunnels are open and

Lach, et al.             Expires December 2003                 [Page 6]

Internet Draft           OverDRiVE Experiments             23 June 2003

  maintained, IPv6 packets are tunneled through the UDP/IPv4 tunnel.
  One consequence of this is that the egress interface of the Mobile
  Router only interacts with IPv6 packets.

  In one practical scenario, the mobile network was first connected to
  the home network outside the metropolitan area, then moved on the
  highway, then entered a metropolitan area hotspot, then went out of
  the hotspot and entered again another hotspot.  During all this
  trajectory, a continuous IPv6 connection was maintained between the
  Local Fixed Node and a Correspondent Node connected on the IPv6
  Internet (neither on the home network nor on the access networks).

  In another practical scenario, the Local Fixed Node running
  exclusively IPv6 protocols, browsed a World Wide Web IPv4 site by
  using a v6-to-v4 conversion service that is connected to the IPv6
  Internet.

3.3 Home Network

  The home network is designed to offer IPv6 Home Agent services for
  Mobile Nodes (both Mobile Hosts and Mobile Routers).  The home
  network is connected to the IPv4 Internet as well as to the IPv6
  Internet.  The Home Agent is a one-interface machine that runs
  Mobile IPv6 [5] with NEMO extensions [4].

  The home network also offers special IPv4 tunneling endpoints for
  connections opened by a Mobile Router when it is connected to any of
  the public networks.  These connections are passed through special
  Front Boxes, part of the mobile network.

3.4 GPRS Networks

  All GPRS access networks used in these experiments offer IPv4 access
  with a private addressing scheme.  They distribute private
  non-routable addresses (10.x.y.z) over a PPP connection, seemingly
  with DHCP servers.  Each of these networks is connected to the
  Internet with NAT boxes.  The three NAT services each corresponding
  to one public access network behave in a different manner related to
  the level of Translation of various fields in the IPv4 packets.  For
  example, with some access networks it is possible to "ping" from the
  private area towards the "public" Internet, while with others it is

3.5 Wixos: an 802.11b Metropolitan Network

  During the month of June 2003, the Wixos network was available for
  public experimentation.  For more information about the Wixos
  network see [6].  Disclaimer: none of the participants in the IST
  OverDRiVE project are affiliated, or represent, in any legal or
  other way the Wixos Network.  The Wixos network was used as a public
  access network.

  The network offers IPv4 access in several "hotspot" areas.  Most of

  the hotspots are not overlapping (in terms of wireless coverage).
  The IPv4 network offers private non-routable IPv4 addresses.  The
  network was not using, at the time of testing, any form of Mobile
  IPv4; an address acquired in one hotspot is not valid under another
  hotspot.

4. Conclusions and Future Work

  Further tests within the OverDRiVE Work Package 2 will include
  continuous streaming of multicast sessions for nodes in the mobile
  network.
