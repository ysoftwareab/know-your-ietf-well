Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
   MIB)for use with network management protocols in the Internet 
   community. In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects 
   for SNMP-based management of DHCP functionality within CableHome 1.0 
   and compliant residential gateways [16]  
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
   SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP 
   framework and existing SNMP standards. 
    
   This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet 
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be 
   addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@ietf.org 
   and/or the author.

1. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
        o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].  
 
        o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events 
             for the purpose of management. The first version of this 
             Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 
             and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 
             [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The second version, called SMIv2, 
             is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] 
             and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].  
 
        o    Message protocols for transferring management information. 
             The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called 
             SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second 
             version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an 
             Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and 
             described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].  The third

Internet Draft    Cable Gateway Configuration MIB        October 2002
 
             version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
             described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 
             [12].  
 
        o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. 
             The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU 
             formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set 
             of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
             described in RFC 1905 [13].  
 
        o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 
             [14] and the view-based access control mechanism described 
             in RFC 2575 [15].  
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
   MIB. 
    
2. Glossary 
    
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from the 
   documents associated with the CableHome 1.0 Specification [16]. 
    
2.1 Cable Gateway Device 
    
   A cable gateway device passes data traffic between the cable 
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and 
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's 
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the WAN 
   and LAN, the cable gateway device provides several services including 
   a DHCP client and a DHCP server [RFC2131], a TFTP server [RFC1350], 
   management services as enabled by SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent compliant with 
   the RFCs listed in Section 1, and security services including 
   stateful packet inspection firewall functionality and software code 
   image verification using techniques described in [RFC3280].  
    
2.2 Portal Services

Internet Draft    Cable Gateway Configuration MIB        October 2002
 
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. The 
   Portal Services set of functions is described in [16]. 
    
2.3 LAN IP Device 
    
   A LAN IP Device is representative of a typical IP device expected to 
   reside on home networks, and is assumed to contain a TCP/IP stack as 
   well as a DHCP client. 
    
2.4 WAN Management (WAN-Man) Address 
    
   WAN Management Addresses are intended for network management traffic 
   on the cable network between the network management system and the PS 
   element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP address 
   space. 
    
2.5 WAN Data (WAN-Data) Address 
    
   WAN Data Addresses are intended for subscriber application traffic on 
   the cable network and beyond, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices 
   and Internet hosts. Typically, these addresses will reside in public 
   IP address space. 
    
2.6 LAN Translated (LAN-Trans) Address 
    
   LAN Translated Addresses are intended for subscriber application and 
   management traffic on the home network between LAN IP Devices and the 
   PS element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP 
   address space, and can typically be reused across subscribers. 
    
2.7 LAN Passthrough (LAN-Pass) Address 
    
   LAN Passthrough Addresses are intended for subscriber application 
   traffic, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices and Internet hosts, 
   on the home network, the cable network, and beyond. Typically, these 
   addresses will reside in public IP address space. 
    
2.8 Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) 
    
   A logical element residing within the PS that encapsulates DHCP 
   functionality within a Cable Gateway Device. This includes both DHCP 
   client as well as DHCP server capabilities. 
    
3. Overview 
    
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
   DHCP client and server functionality within CableHome compliant

   Residential Gateways (RG).  The specification is derived from the 
   CableHome 1.0 Specification [16].  
    
   The DHCP client within a Cable Gateway will acquire one or more 
   addresses from WAN based DHCP servers. Collectively, these are  
   known as WAN addresses. These addresses are used for both management 
   traffic (WAN management addresses) and data traffic (WAN data 
   addresses) to and from the WAN side of the residential gateway. 
    
   The DHCP server within a Cable Gateway will provide private addresses 
   to LAN IP Devices. These addresses will be translated to and from one 
   of the WAN IP addresses for traffic that enters or exits the LAN, and 
   are and collectively known as LAN Translated Addresses. 
    
   There are a number of logical functional elements used to describe 
   Cable Gateway configuration functionality. 
    
        o    The Portal Services (PS) logical element is the functional 
             entity that aggregates all specified Cable Gateway 
             capabilities.  
 
        o    The Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) logical element is the 
             functional entity that embodies the Cable Gateway DHCP 
             capabilities.  
 
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB is structured into three groups: 
    
        o    The cabhCdpBase group provides baseline and information 
             for RG DHCP client and server functionality, including 
             reset information, counts for WAN addresses acquired, and 
             counts for LAN addresses served.  
 
        o    The cabhCdpAddr group provides information about 
             dynamically acquired and served addresses within the RG, 
             and includes the following tables:  
 
                -   cabhCdpLanAddrTable: information and reservations 
                    for  addressees served to the LAN 
                -   cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable: WAN address acquisition 
                    information 
                -   cabhCdpWanDataAddrServerTable: WAN based DNS server 
                    information 
    
        o    The cabhCdpServer group provides information about the RG 
             DHCP service (address pool range, subnet information, RG 
             Based server info, etc).

3.2 Cable Gateway Configuration System Description 
    
   The functional element which encapsulated DHCP functionality within 
   the Cable Gateway is known as the Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP).  
    
   The CDP operating assumptions include: 
    
        o    LAN IP Devices implement a DHCP client as defined by  [RFC 
             2131].  
 
        o    The cable network provisioning system implements a DHCP 
             server as defined by [RFC 2131].  
 
        o    If the cable network provisioning system's DHCP server 
             supports DHCP Option 61 (client identifier option),the 
             WAN-Man and all WAN-Data IP interfaces can share a common 
             MAC address.  
 
        o    LAN IP Devices may support various DHCP Options and BOOTP 
             Vendor Extensions, allowed by [RFC 2132].  
 
   The following design guidelines drive the capabilities defined for 
   the CDP: 
    
        o    CableHome addressing mechanisms will be MSO controlled, 
             and will provide MSO knowledge of and accessibility to 
             CableHome network elements and LAN IP Devices.  
  
        o    CableHome address acquisition and management processes 
             will not require human intervention (assuming that a 
             user/household account has already been established).  
 
        o    CableHome address acquisition and management will be 
             scalable to support the expected increase in the number of 
             LAN IP devices.  
 
        o    It is preferable for LAN IP Device addresses to remain the 
             same after events such as a power cycle or Internet 
             Service Provider switch.  
 
        o    CableHome will provide a mechanism by which the number of 
             LAN IP Devices in the LAN-Trans realm can be monitored and 
             controlled.  
 
        o    In home communication will continue to work as provisioned 
             during periods of Headend address server outage. 
             Addressing support will be provided for newly added LAN IP 
             Devices and address expirations during remote address 
             server outages.

        o    IP addresses will be conserved when possible (both 
             globally routable addresses and private cable network 
             management addresses).  
 
3.2.1 Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) System Description 
    
   The Cable Gateway DHCP Portal is the logical entity that is 
   responsible for CableHome addressing activities. The CDP address 
   request and address allocation responsibilities within the CableHome 
   environment include: 
    
        o    IP address assignment, IP address maintenance, and the 
             delivery of configuration parameters (via DHCP) to LAN IP 
             Devices in the LAN-Trans Address Realm. 
  
        o    Acquisition of a WAN-Man and zero or more WAN-Data IP 
             addresses and associated DHCP configuration parameters for 
             the Portal Services (PS) element. 
 
        o    Provide information to the CableHome Name Portal (CNP) in 
             support of LAN IP Device host name services. 
    
   The PS maintains two hardware addresses, one of which is to be used 
   to acquire an IP address for management purpose, the other could be 
   used for the acquisition of one or more IP address(es) for data. To 
   prevent hardware address spoofing, the PS does not allow either of 
   the two hardware addresses to be modified. 
    
   The Portal Services element requires an IP Address on the home LAN 
   for its role on the LAN as a router (see Section 8, Packet Handling 
   and Address Translation), DHCP Server (CDS), and DNS Server). For 
   each of these three Portal Service Element server and router 
   functions, a LAN IP address is saved in the PS database. Each can be 
   accessed via a different MIB object, which are listed below: 
    
        o    Router (default gateway) Address cabhCdpServerRouter 
        o    Domain Name Server (DNS) Address cabhCdpServerDnsAddress 
        o    Dynamic Host Configuration Server (DHCP) (CDS) Address 
             cabhCdpServerDhcpAddress 
    
   The default value of cabhCdpServerRouter is 192.168.0.1. The default 
   values of cabhCdpServerDnsAddress and cabhCdpServerDhcpAddress are 
   equal to the value of cabhCdpServerRouter. The CDP capabilities are 
   embodied by two functional elements residing within the CDP: 
    
        o    the Cable Gateway DHCP Server (CDS)  
        o    the Cable Gateway DHCP Client (CDC).

   The CDC exchanges DHCP messages with the DHCP server in the cable 
   network (WAN Management address realm) to acquire an IP address and 
   DHCP options for the PS, for management purposes. The CDC could 
   alsoexchange DHCP messages with the DHCP server in the cable network 
   (WANData address realm) to acquire zero or more IP address(es) on 
   behalfof LAN IP Devices in the LAN-Trans realm. The CDS exchanges 
   DHCP messages with LAN IP Devices in the LAN-Trans realm, and assigns 
   private IP addresses, grants leases to, and could provide DHCPoptions 
   to DHCP clients within those LAN IP Devices. LAN IP Devices in the 
   LAN-Pass realm receive their IP addresses, leases, and DHCP options 
   directly from the DHCP server in the cable network. The CDP simply 
   bridges DHCP messages between the DHCP server in the cable network 
   and LAN IP Devices in the LAN-Pass realm. The following figure 
   illustrates these concepts.

3.2.1.1 Cable Gateway DHCP Server (CDS) System Description 
    
   The CDS is a standard DHCP server as defined in [RFC 2131], and 
   responsibilities include: 
    
        o    The CDS assigns addresses to and delivers DHCP 
             configuration parameters to LAN IP Devices receiving an 
             address in the LAN-Trans address realm. The CDS learns 
             DHCP options from the NMS system and provides these DHCP 
             options to LAN IP Devices. If DHCP options have not been 
             provided by the NMS system (for example when the PS boots

             during a cable outage), the CDS relies on built-in default 
             values (DefVals) for required options. 
     
        o    The CDS is able to provide DHCP addressing services to LAN 
             IP Devices, independent of theWAN connectivity state. 
 
        o    The number of addresses supplied by the CDS to LAN IP 
             Devices is controllable by the NMS system. The behavior of 
             the CDS when a cable operator settable limit is exceeded 
             is also configurable via the NMS. Possible CDS actions 
             when the limit is exceeded include (1) assign a LAN-Trans 
             IP address and treat the WAN to LAN CAT interconnection as 
             would normally occur if he limit had not been exceeded and 
             (2) do not assign an address to requesting LAN IP devices. 
             An address threshold  setting of 0 indicates the maximum 
             threshold possible for the LAN-Trans IP address pool 
             defined by the pool "start" (cabhCdpLanPoolStart ) and 
             "end" (cabhCdpLanPoolEnd )values. 
 
        o    In the absence of time of day information from the Time of 
             Day (ToD) server, the CDS uses the PS default starting 
             time of 0 (January 1, 1970), updates the Expire Time for 
             any active leases in the LAN-Trans realm to re-synchronize 
             with DHCP clients in LAN IP Devices, and maintains leases 
             based on that starting point until the PS synchronizes 
             with the Time of Day server in the cable network. 
 
        o    During the PS Boot process, the CDS remains inactive until 
             activated by the PS. 
 
        o    If the PS Primary Packet-handling mode 
             (cabhCapPrimaryMode)as been set to Passthrough AND the PS 
             provisioning process has completed (as indicated by 
             cabhPsDevProvState = pass(1)), then the CDS is disabled. 
    
   LAN IP Devices may receive addresses that reside in the LAN-Pass 
   realm. As shown in Figure 7-2, LAN-Pass address requests are served 
   by the WAN addressing infrastructure, not the PS. LAN-Pass addressing 
   processes will occur when the PS is configured to operate in 
   Passthrough Mode or Mixed Bridging/Routing Mode. In these cases, DHCP   
   interactions will take place directly between LAN IP Devices and 
   Headend servers, and CableHome does not specify the process. 
    
   Throughout this document, the terms Dynamic Allocation and Manual  
   Allocation are used as defined in [RFC 2131]. The CDS Provisioned 
   DHCP Options, cabhCdpServer objects in the CDP MIB, are DHCP Options 
   That can be provisioned by the NMS, and are offered by the CDS to LAN 
   IP devices assigned a LAN-Trans address. CDS Provisioned DHCP 
   Options, cabhCdpServer objects, persist after a PS power cycle and

   the NMS system can establish, read, write and delete these objects. 
   CDS Provisioned DHCP Options, cabhCdpServer objects, are retained 
   during periods of cable outage and these objects are offered to LAN 
   IP devices assigned a LAN-Trans address during periods of cable 
   outage. The CDC persistent storage of DHCP options is consistent with 
   [RFC 2131] section 2.1. The default values of CDS Provisioned DHCP 
   Options, cabhCdpServer objects, are defined and the NMS can reset the  
   CDS Provisioned DHCP Options, cabhCdpServer objects, to their default 
   values, by writing to the cabhCdpSetToFactory MIB object. 
    
   The CDS Address Threshold (cabhCdpLanTrans) objects contain the event 
   control parameters used by the CDS to signal the CMP to generate a 
   notification to the Headend management system, when the number of 
   LAN-Trans addresses assigned by the CDS exceeds the preset threshold. 
    
   The Address Count (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) object is a value  
   indicating the number of LAN-Trans addresses assigned by the CDS that  
   have active DHCP leases. 
    
   The Address Threshold (cabhCdpLanTransThreshold) object is a value  
   indicating when a notification is generated to the Headend management 
   system. The notification is generated when the CDS assigns an address 
   to the LAN IP Device that causes the Address Count  
    (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) to exceed the Address Threshold  
    (cabhCdpLanTransThreshold). 
    
   The Threshold Exceeded Action (cabhCdpLanTransAction) is the action 
   taken by the CDS while the Address Count (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) 
   exceeds the Address Threshold (cabhCdpLanTransThreshold). If the 
   Threshold Exceeded Action (cabhCdpLanTransAction) allows address  
   assignments after the count is exceeded, the notification is  
   generated each time an address is assigned. The defined actions are 
   a) assign a LAN-Trans address as normal, and b) do not assign an 
   address to the next requesting LAN IP Device. 
    
   The Address Count (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) continues to be updated 
   during periods of cable outage. The CDS MIB also contains the Address  
   Pool Start (cabhCdpLanPoolStart) and Address Pool End  
   (cabhCdpLanPoolEnd) parameters. These parameters indicate the range 
   of addresses in the LAN-Trans realm that can be assigned by the CDS 
   to LAN IP Devices. 
    
   The CDP LAN Address Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) contains the list of  
   parameters associated with addresses allocated to LAN IP Devices with 
   LAN-Trans addresses. These parameters   include: 
    
         1. The Client Identifiers [RFC 2132] section 9.14  
            (cabhCdpLanAddrClientID)

Internet Draft    Cable Gateway Configuration MIB        October 2002 
 
         2. The LAN IP address assigned to the client 
            (cabhCdpLanAddrIp) 
 
         3. An indication that the address was allocated either 
            manually or dynamically (via the CDP)(cabhCdpLanAddrConfig) 
    
    
   The CDS stores information about the identification of a LAN IP  
   Device in the object cabhCdpLanAddrClientID. The first priority for 
   the value to be stored in this object is the Client ID value passed 
   by the LAN IP Device in DHCP Option 61, Client Identifier. If no 
   value is passed in Option 61, the CDS stores the value passed in the 
   chaddr field of the DHCP DISCOVER message issued by the LAN IP 
   Device. 
    
   The CDS creates a CDP Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) entry when it  
   allocates an IP address to a LAN IP Device. The CDS can create CDP 
   Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) entries during periods of cable outage. 
    
   The CDP Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) maintains a DHCP lease time for  
   each LAN IP Device. 
    
   NMS-provisioned CDP Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) entries are retained 
   during periods of cable outage and persist across a PS power-cycle 
    
3.2.1.1 Cable Gateway DHCP Client (CDC) System Description 
    
   The CDC is a standard DHCP client as defined in [RFC 2131], and  
   responsibilities include: 
    
        o    The CDC makes requests to Headend DHCP servers for the 
             acquisition of addresses in the WANMan and may make 
             requests to Headend DHCP servers for the acquisition of 
             addresses in the WAN-Data address realms. The CDC also 
             understands and acts upon a number of CableHome DHCP 
             configuration parameters. 
  
        o    The CDC supports acquisition of one WAN-Man IP address and 
             zero or more WAN-Data IP addresses. 
 
        o    The CDC supports the Vendor Class Identifier Option (DHCP 
             option 60), the Vendor Specific Information option (DHCP 
             Option 43), and the Client Identifier Option (DHCP option 
             61). 
 
        o    In the default case, the CDC will acquire a single IP 
             address for simultaneous use by theWAN-Man and WAN-Data IP 
             interfaces. In order to minimize changes needed to 
             existing Headend DHCP servers, the use of a Client

             Identifier (DHCP option 61) by the CDC is not required in 
             this default case. 
    
   The CDP supports various DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions, 
   allowed by [RFC 2132]. 
    
   The Vendor Class Identifier Option (DHCP option 60) defines a 
   CableLabs device class. For CableHome 1.0, the Vendor Class 
   Identifier Option will contain the string "CableHome1.0", to identify 
   a CableHome 1.0 Portal Services (PS) logical element, whenever the 
   CDC requests a WAN-Man or WAN-Data address. 
    
   The Vendor Specific Information option (DHCP Option 43) further 
   identifies the type of device and its capabilities. It describes the 
   type of component that is making the request (embedded or standalone, 
   CM or PS), the components that are contained in the device (CM, MTA, 
   PS, etc.), the device serial number, and also allows device specific 
   parameters. {add reference to CH spec and the DHCP options table} 
    
   The WAN-Data IP Address count parameter of the CDP MIB 
   (cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount) is the number of IP address leases the 
   CDC is required to attempt to acquire for the WAN side of NAT and 
   NAPT mappings. The default value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount is 
   zero, which means that, by default, the CDC will acquire only a WAN-
   Man IP address. 
    
3.2.1.1.1 Cable Gateway DHCP Client Option 61 
    
   The CableHome PS element can have one or more WAN IP addresses  
   associated with a one or more link layer (e.g. MAC) interfaces. 
   Therefore, the CDC cannot rely solely on a MAC address as a unique 
   client identifier value. 
    
   CableHome allows for the use of the Client Identifier Option (DHCP 
   option 61), [RFC 2132] section 9.14, to uniquely identify the logical 
   WAN interface associated with a particular IP address. 
    
   The PS is required to have two hardware addresses: one to be used to 
   uniquely identify the logical WAN interface associated with the WAN- 
   Man IP address (WAN-Man hardware address) and the other to be used to 
   uniquely identify the logical WAN interface associated with WAN-Data 
   IP addresses (WAN-Data hardware address). 
    
3.2.1.1.2 WAN Address Modes 
    
   In order to enable compatibility with as many cable operator 
   provisioning systems as possible, the CDC will support the following 
   configurable WAN Address Modes:

Internet Draft    Cable Gateway Configuration MIB        October 2002 
 
        o    WAN Address Mode 0:  
             The PS Element makes use of a single WAN IP Address, 
             acquired via DHCP using the WAN-Man hardware address. The 
             PS Element has one WAN-Man IP Interface and zero WAN-Data 
             IP Interfaces. This Address Mode is only applicable when 
             the PS Primary Packet-handling Mode (cabhCapPrimaryMode) 
             is set to Passthrough (refer to Section 8.3.2). The cable 
             operator's Headend DHCP server typically needs no software 
             modifications to support this Address Mode. In WAN Address 
             Mode 0, the  value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount is zero. 
              
        o    WAN Address Mode 1:  
             The PS Element makes use of a single WAN IP Address, 
             acquired via DHCP using the WAN-Man hardware address. The 
             PS Element has one WAN-Man IP Interface and one WAN-Data 
             IP Interface. These two Interfaces share a single, common 
             IP address. This Address Mode is only applicable when the 
             PS Primary Packet- handling Mode (cabhCapPrimaryMode) is 
             set to NAPT. The cable operator's Headend DHCP server 
             typically needs no software modifications to support this 
             Address Mode. In WAN Address Mode 1, the value of 
             cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount is zero. 
              
        o    WAN Address Mode 2:  
             The PS Element acquires a WAN-Man IP address using the 
             unique WAN-Man hardware address, and is subsequently 
             configured by the NMS to request one or more unique WAN-
             Data IP  Address(es). The PS Element will have one WAN-Man 
             and one or more WAN-Data IP Interface(s). All WAN-Data IP 
             addresses will share a common hardware address that is 
             unique from the WAN- Man hardware address. The two or more 
             Interfaces (one WAN-Man and one or moreWAN-Data) each has 
             its own, unshared IP address. The CDP is configured by the 
             cable operator to operate in WAN Address Mode 2 by writing 
             a nonzero value to cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, via the PS 
             Configuration File or an SNMP set-request. This Address 
             Mode is applicable when the PS Primary Packet-handling 
             Mode (cabhCapPrimaryMode) is set to NAPT or NAT. The cable 
             operator's Headend DHCP server might need software 
             modification to include support for Client IDs (DHCP 
             Option 61) so that it can assign multiple IP addresses to 
             the single WAN-Data hardware address. 
    
   There are four potential scenarios for WAN-Data IP addresses: 
    
         1. The PS is configured to request zero WAN-Data IP addresses. 
            No WAN-Data Client IDs are needed. 
 
Jones                      Expires March 2003               [Page 13]

Internet Draft    Cable Gateway Configuration MIB        October 2002 
 
         2. The PS is configured to request one or more WAN-Data IP 
            addresses and there are no MSO-configured 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries in the CDP MIB. The PS 
            is required to auto-generate as many unique WAN-Data Client 
            IDs as the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount. 
 
         3. The PS is configured to request one or more WAN-Data IP 
            addresses and there are at least as many MSOconfigured 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries as the value of 
            cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, i.e., the MSO has provisioned 
            enough WAN-Data Client ID values. The PS does not auto-
            generate any Client IDs. 
 
         4. The PS is configured to request one or more WAN-Data IP 
            addresses and there are fewer MSO-configured 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries than the value of 
            cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, i.e., the MSO has provisioned 
            some but not provisioned enough WAN-Data Client ID values. 
            The PS is required to auto-generate enough additional 
            unique WAN-Data Client IDs to bring the total number of 
            unique WAN-Data Client IDs to the value of 
            cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount. 
    
   If the cable operator desires for the PS to acquire one or more WAN- 
   Data IP addresses, that are distinct from the WAN-Man IP address, the 
   procedure is as follows. For all WAN Address Modes, the PS first 
   requests a WAN-Man IP address using the WAN-Man hardware address. The 
   procedure described below assumes the PS has already acquired a WAN- 
   Man IP address: 
    
         1. The cable operator optionally provisions the PS with unique 
            specific Client IDs, by writing values to the 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries of the CDP MIB's 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable, via the PS Configuration File or 
            SNMP set-request message(s). 
  
         2. The cable operator configures the CDP to operate in WAN 
            Address Mode 2 by writing cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount to a 
            nonzero value through the PS Configuration File or SNMP 
            set-request message. 
 
         3. After the CDP has been configured to operate inWAN Address 
            Mode 2 as described in step 2), the PS checks to see if 
            Client ID values have been provisioned by the NMS as 
            described in step 1). If a number of Client ID values 
            greater than or equal to the value of 
            cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount have been provisioned, the PS 
            uses these values in DHCP Option 61 when requesting the 
            WAN-Data IP address(es). If Client ID values have not been

Internet Draft    Cable Gateway Configuration MIB        October 2002 
 
            provisioned, i.e., if the cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId 
            entries do not exist, or if the number of Client ID values 
            provisioned is less than the value of 
            cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, the PS  generates a number of 
            unique Client ID values such that in combination with the 
            provisioned Client IDs, the total number of unique Client 
            IDs equals the value of  cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount. The PS 
            generates Client ID values by using the WAN-Data hardware 
            address alone for the first requested WAN-Data IP address, 
            and by concatenating the WAN- Data hardware address with a 
            count that is 8 bits in length for the second and all 
            subsequentWAN-Data IP addresses. If no Client IDs have been 
            provisioned by the NMS, the first 8-bit Count value is 0x02 
            (indicating the second requestedWAN-Data IP address), the 
            second count value is 0x03, and so on.  
    
            Example for the case when no Client IDs have been 
            provisioned by the network management system: 
    
               Given WAN-Data hardware address 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD 
    
                 PS-generated Client ID for the first requested WAN-
                 Data IP address: 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD 
                  
                 PS-generated Client ID for the second requested WAN-
                 Data IP address: 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD02 
                  
                 PS-generated Client ID for the third requested WAN-
                 Data IP address: 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD03 
                  
                 PS-generated Client ID for the nth requested WAN-Data 
                 IP address: 0xCDCDCDCDCDCDn (n=<0xFF) 
    
           If some Client IDs have been provisioned by the NMS but the 
           number is less than the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, 
           the PS generates additional Client IDs as needed to bring 
           the total number of Client IDs to the value of 
           cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount. The PS will generate these 
           additional Client IDs values by appending an 8-bit count 
           value to the WAN-Data hardware address, starting with 0x02, 
           unless that would duplicate a provisioned Client ID. If the 
           Client IDs provisioned by the NMS follow the same format 
           (hardware address with 8-bit count value), the PS is 
           required to use a unique count value so as to not duplicate 
           a provisioned Client ID. 
            
           Example for the case when Client IDs have been provisioned 
           by the NMS (three provisioned Client ID values,         
           cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount = 5):

                  First provisioned Client ID for the first WAN-Data IP

            cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries to the end of the 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable. 
  
         5. The PS (CDC) requests (repeating the DHCP DISCOVER process 
            as needed) as many unique WAN-Data IP addresses as the 
            value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount specifies, using the 
            WAN-Data hardware address in the chaddr field of the DHCP 
            message and the Client ID value(s) from step 3) in DHCP 
            Option 61, beginning with the first 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entry of the 
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable. The CDC is not permitted to 
            request more WAN-Data IP addresses than the value of 
            cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, even if the number of provisioned 
            Client IDs is greater than the value of  
            cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable.

7. Security Considerations 
 
   This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public 
   Internet access for a cable data service subscriber, via a DOCSIS 
   cable modem.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects 
   represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large 
   number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the  
   cabhPsDevConfigFile and cabhPsDevConfigHash may allow an end-user to

   increase their service levels, change the permitted IP address  
   leases, or affect other end-users in either a positive or negative  
   manner. 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
      o   The Cable Gateway Device may have its Portal Services software  
          changed by the actions of the management system.  An improper  
          software load may result in substantial vulnerabilities and                 
          the loss of the ability of the management system to control  
          the cable modem. 
    
      o   The device may be reset by setting cabhPsDevResetNow =  
          true(1). This causes the device to reload its configuration  
          files as well as eliminating all previous non-persistent 
          network management settings. As such, this may provide a 
          vector for attacking the system. 
      
   This MIB does not affect confidentiality of services on a Cable  
   Gateway device.  Since a CableLabs CableHome-compliant Cable Gateway 
   Device accesses the Internet through a DOCSIS compliant cable modem,  
   the privacy mechanism defined for a DOCSIS cable modem in [18]  
   is a mechanism by which a Cable Gateway device could be ensured 
   confidentiality of service. 
    
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model [12]  and the View-based Access 
   Control Model [15] is recommended. 
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
    (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
    (change/create/delete) them.
