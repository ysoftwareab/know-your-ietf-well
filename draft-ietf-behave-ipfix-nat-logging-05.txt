           IPFIX Information Elements for logging NAT Events
                 draft-ietf-behave-ipfix-nat-logging-05

Abstract

   Network operators require NAT devices to log events like creation and
   deletion of translations and information about the resources that the
   NAT device is managing.  The logs are essential in many cases to
   identify an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious
   attacks and for various other purposes of accounting.  Since there is
   no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices
   log the information using proprietary formats and hence it is
   difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a consistent
   way to log the data makes it difficult to write the collector
   applications that would receive this data and process it to present
   useful information.  This document describes the formats for logging
   of NAT events.

1.  Terminology

   The usage of the term "NAT device" in this document refer to any
   NAT44 and NAT64 devices.  The usage of the term "collector" refers to
   any device that receives the binary data from a NAT device and
   converts that into meaningful information.  This document uses the
   term "Session" as it is defined in [RFC2663] and the term BIB as it
   is defined in [RFC6146].  The usage of the term Information Element
   (IE) is defined in [RFC7011].

   The IPFIX Information elements that are NAT specific are created with
   NAT terminology.  In order to avoid creating duplicate IE's, IE's
   that are reused if they convey the same meaning.  However, that
   causes confusion in terminology used in NAT specific terms and IPFIX
   IE's.  Any non-IPFIX terminology used to convey NAT events are
   described in this section.

   The document uses the term timestamp for the Information element
   which defines the time when an event is logged, this is the same as
   IPFIX term observationTimeMilliseconds as described in [IPFIX-IANA].
   Since observationTimeMilliseconds is not self explanatory for NAT
   implementors, this document uses the term timeStamp.

2.  Introduction

   The IPFIX Protocol [RFC7011] defines a generic push mechanism for
   exporting information and events.  The IPFIX Information Model
   [IPFIX-IANA] defines a set of standard Information Elements (IEs)
   which can be carried by the IPFIX protocol.  This document details
   the IPFIX Information Elements(IEs) that MUST be logged by a NAT
   device that supports NAT logging using IPFIX.  The document will
   specify the format of the IE's that SHOULD be logged by the NAT
   device and all the optional fields.  The fields specified in this
   document are gleaned from [RFC4787] and [RFC5382].

   This document and [I-D.behave-syslog-nat-logging] are written in
   order to standardize the events and parameters to be recorded, using
   IPFIX [RFC7011] and SYSLOG [RFC5424]respectively.  The intent is to
   provide a consistent way to log information irrespective of the
   mechanism that is used.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Scope

   This document provides the information model to be used for logging
   the NAT events including Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) events.  This
   document focuses exclusively on the specification of IPFIX IE's.
   [RFC7011] provides guidance on the choices of the transport protocols
   used for IPFIX and their effects.  This document does not provide
   guidance on the transport protocol like TCP, UDP or SCTP that is to
   be used to log NAT events.  The log events SHOULD NOT be lost but the
   choice of the actual transport protocol is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   The existing IANA IPFIX IEs registry [IPFIX-IANA] already has
   assignments for most of the NAT logging events.  This document uses
   the allocated IPFIX IE's and will request IANA for the ones that are
   defined in this document but not yet allocated.

   This document assumes that the NAT device will use the existing IPFIX
   framework to send the log events to the collector.  This would mean
   that the NAT device will specify the template that it is going to use
   for each of the events.  The templates can be of varying length and
   there could be multiple templates that a NAT device could use to log
   the events.

   The implementation details of the collector application is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   The optimization of logging the NAT events is left to the
   implementation and is beyond the scope of this document.

4.  Applicability

   NAT logging based on IPFIX uses binary encoding and hence is very
   efficient.  IPFIX based logging is recommended for environments where
   a high volume of logging is required, for example, where per-flow
   logging is needed or in case of Carrier Grade NAT.  However, IPFIX
   based logging requires a collector that processes the binary data and
   requires a network management application that converts this binary
   data to a human readable format.

5.  Event based logging

   An event in a NAT device can be viewed as a state transition as it
   relates to the management of NAT resources.  The creation and
   deletion of NAT sessions and bindings are examples of events as it
   results in the resources (addresses and ports) being allocated or
   freed.  The events can happen either through the processing of data
   packets flowing through the NAT device or through an external entity
   installing policies on the NAT router or as a result of an
   asynchronous event like a timer.  The list of events are provided in
   Section 4.1.  Each of these events SHOULD be logged, unless they are
   administratively prohibited.  A NAT device MAY log these events to
   multiple collectors if redundancy is required.  The network
   administrator will specify the collectors to which the log records
   are to be sent.

   A collector may receive NAT events from multiple CGN devices and MUST
   be able to distinguish between the devices.  Each CGN device should
   have a unique source ID to identify themselves.  The source ID is
   part of the IPFIX template and data exchange.

   Prior to logging any events, the NAT device MUST send the template of
   the record to the collector to advertise the format of the data
   record that it is using to send the events.  The templates can be
   exchanged as frequently as required given the reliability of the
   connection.  There SHOULD be a configurable timer for controlling the
   template refresh.  NAT device SHOULD combine as many events as
   possible in a single packet to effectively utilize the network
   bandwidth.

5.1.  Logging of destination information

   Logging of destination information in a NAT event has been discussed
   in [RFC6302] and [RFC6888].  Logging of destination information
   increases the size of each record and increases the need for storage
   considerably.  It increases the number of log events generated
   because when the same user connects to a different destination, it
   results in a log record per destination address.  Logging of
   destination information also results in the loss of privacy and hence
   should be done with caution.  However, this draft provides the
   necessary fields to log the destination information in cases where
   they should be logged.

5.2.  Information Elements

   The templates could contain a subset of the Information Elements(IEs)
   shown in Table 1 depending upon the event being logged.  For example
   a NAT44 session creation template record will contain,

   {sourceIPv4Adress, postNATSourceIPv4Address, destinationIpv4Address,
   postNATDestinationIPv4Address, sourceTransportPort,
   postNAPTSourceTransportPort, destinationTransportPort,
   postNAPTDestTransportPort, internalAddressRealm, natEvent, timeStamp}

   An example of the actual event data record is shown below - in a
   human readable form

   {192.168.16.1, 201.1.1.100, 207.85.231.104, 207.85.231.104, 14800,
   1024, 80, 80, 0, 1, 09:20:10:789}

   A single NAT device could be exporting multiple templates and the
   collector MUST support receiving multiple templates from the same
   source.

   The following is the table of all the IE's that a NAT device would
   need to export the events.  The formats of the IE's and the IPFIX IDs
   are listed below.  Some of the IPFIX IE's are not assigned yet, and
   hence the detailed description of these fields are requested in the

   The Quota exceeded events are generated when the hard limits set by
   the administrator has reached or exceeded.  The following table shows
   the sub event types for the Quota exceeded or limits reached event.
   The events that can be reported are the Maximum session entries limit
   reached, Maximum BIB entries limit reached, Maximum session/BIB
   entries per user limit reached and maximum subscribers or hosts limit
   reached.

5.5.  Threshold reached Event types

   The following table shows the sub event types for the threshold
   reached event.  The administrator can configure the thresholds and
   whenever the threshold is reached or exceeded, the corresponding
   events are generated.  The main difference between Quota Exceeded and
   the Threshold reached events is that, once the Quota exceeded events
   are hit, the packets are dropped or mappings wont be created etc,
   whereas, the threshold reached events will provide the operator a
   chance to take action before the traffic disruptions can happen.  A
   NAT device can choose to implement one or the other or both.

   The address pool high threshold event will be reported when the
   address pool reaches a high water mark as defined by the operator.
   This will serve as an indication that the operator might have to add
   more addresses to the pool or an indication that the subsequent users
   may be denied NAT translation mappings.

   The address and port mapping high threshold event is generated, when
   the number of ports in the configured address pool has reached a
   configured threshold.

   The per-user address and port mapping high threshold is generated
   when a single user uses more address and port mapping than a
   configured threshold.

   |              Threshold Exceeded Event Name              | Values |

   |      Address and port mapping high threshold event      |      3 |
   |  Address and port mapping per user high threshold event |      4 |

5.6.  Templates for NAT Events

   The following is the template of events that will be logged.  The
   events below are identified at the time of this writing but the set
   of events is extensible.  Depending on the implementation and
   configuration various IE's specified can be included or ignored.

5.6.1.  NAT44 create and delete session events

   These events will be generated when a NAT44 session is created or
   deleted.  The template will be the same, the natEvent will indicate
   whether it is a create or a delete event.  The following is a
   template of the event.

   The destination address and port information is optional as required
   by [RFC6888].  However, when the destination information is
   suppressed, the session log event contains the same information as
   the BIB event.  In such cases, the NAT device SHOULD NOT send both
   BIB and session events.

   This event will be generated when a NAT device runs out of global
   IPv4 addresses in a given pool of addresses.  Typically, this event
   would mean that the NAT device won't be able to create any new
   translations until some addresses/ports are freed.  This event SHOULD
   be rate limited as many packets hitting the device at the same time
   will trigger a burst of addresses exhausted events.

   The following is a template of the event.  Note that either the NAT

5.6.10.  Port block allocation and de-allocation

   This event will be generated when a NAT device allocates/de-allocates
   ports in a bulk fashion, as opposed to allocating a port on a per
   flow basis.

   portRangeStart represents the starting value of the range.

   portRangeEnd represents the ending value of the range.

   NAT devices would do this in order to reduce logs and potentially to
   limit the number of connections a subscriber is allowed to use.  In
   the following Port Block allocation template, the portRangeStart and
   portRangeEnd MUST be specified.

   It is up to the implementation to choose to consolidate log records
   in case two consecutive port ranges for the same user are allocated
   or freed.

6.  Encoding

6.1.  IPFIX

   This document uses IPFIX as the encoding mechanism to describe the
   logging of NAT events.  However, the information that is logged
   SHOULD be the same irrespective of what kind of encoding scheme is
   used.  IPFIX is chosen because is it an IETF standard that meets all
   the needs for a reliable logging mechanism.  IPFIX provides the
   flexibility to the logging device to define the data sets that it is
   logging.  The IEs specified for logging MUST be the same irrespective
   of the encoding mechanism used.

   review and comments.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The following information elements are requested from IANA IPFIX
   registry.

   Name : natInstanceId

   Description: This Information Element identifies an Instance of the
   NAT that runs on a NAT middlebox function after the packet passed the
   Observation Point.

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned32

   Data Type Semantics: identifier

   Reference:

   See RFC 791 [RFC791] for the definition of the IPv4 source address
   field.  See RFC 3022 [RFC3022] for the definition of NAT.  See RFC
   3234 [RFC3234] for the definition of middleboxes.

   Name: internalAddressRealm

   Description: This Information Element represents the internal address
   realm where the packet is originated from or destined to.  By
   definition, a NAT mapping can be created from two address realms, one
   from internal and one from external.  Realms are implementation
   dependent and can represent a VRF ID or a VLAN ID or some unique

   Description: This Information Element identifies the threshold type
   that is reported by the event.  There are different types of
   thresholds as describer in Table 4.

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned32

   Data Type Semantics: identifier

   Reference:

9.  Management Considerations

   This section considers requirements for management of the log system
   to support logging of the events described above.  It first covers
   requirements applicable to log management in general.  Any additional
   standardization required to fullfil these requirements is out of
   scope of the present document.  Some management considerations is
   covered in [I-D.behave-syslog-nat-logging].  This document covers the
   additional considerations.

9.1.  Ability to collect events from multiple NAT devices

   An IPFIX collector MUST be able to collect events from multiple NAT
   devices and be able to decipher events based on the sourceID in the
   IPFIX header.

9.2.  Ability to suppress events

   The exhaustion events can be overwhelming during traffic bursts and
   hence SHOULD be handled by the NAT devices to rate limit them before
   sending them to the collectors.  For eg. when the port exhaustion
   happens during bursty conditions, instead of sending a port
   exhaustion event for every packet, the exhaustion events SHOULD be
   rate limited by the NAT device.

10.  Security Considerations

   None.
