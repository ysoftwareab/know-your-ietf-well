Abstract 
    
   This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event 
   package to carry device information including device status and 
   device profile. Device status refers to a set of dynamic attributes 
   that describe device's operating state, availability, and location 
   information etc. Device profile on the other hand refers to a 
   limited set of static attributes including device type, name, format 
   type of status information, and model etc. of a particular device.

   Device status information is particularly important to monitoring 
   applications where a user agent would be able to monitor the status 
   of a SIP device from a remote location and be notified of the 
   changes of status.

1.   Introduction 
    
   The  Session  Initiation  Protocol  (SIP)  [1]  specific  event 
   notification mechanism provides a user agent with a way to subscribe 
   to and receive notifications of events within a SIP networks. SIP 
   also has the notion of event package. An event package is an 
   instantiation of a generalized event framework where a set of state 
   information to be reported by a notifier to a subscriber. Here we 
   define  an  event  package  for  device  status  and  device  profile 
   information. This event package can be used by a user agent who 
   would like to monitor the status of network attached SIP devices 
   from a remote location and be notified of the changes of status.  
    
   This document does not define a common format for device status 
   information. The format of device status information should be 
   vendor specific. Instead, we define a common format for device 
   profile information, which has an attribute that defines the vendor 
   specific format type of the device status information to be used for 
   that particular device. This event package defines a mechanism by 
   which a user agent can retrieve device profile information and then 
   use the format type of the device status information to request 
   status  notifications.  While  focus  of  the  current  draft  is  to 
   retrieve device status information, it can easily be extended to 
   include user, application or network or any other profiles for a 
   device. 
    
   This package is particularly important to retrieve the operating 
   status, availability, and location etc. of SIP devices. In order to 
   retrieve the operating status of a SIP device, a user agent will 
   first subscribe for the common device profile information of the SIP 
   device. In the notification message, the user agent will receive the 
   profile of the SIP device, which contains the name of vendor 
   specific device status format. The user agent will then subscribe 
   for the vendor specific device status attributes that correspond to 
   the status of the SIP device and in response notification events 
   will  be  generated  to  the  user  agent  with  the  values  of  the 
   attributes the user has subscribed for. The specific detail of this 
   event package and the sequence of operation are described in the 
   later part of this document.

2.   Terminology and Conventions 
    
   Device: A software or hardware appliance, which is represented by a    
SIP UA  
    
   Device Status: A set of dynamic attributes describing the operating 
   state, availability, and location information etc. of a device. 
    
   Device Profile: A limited set of static attributes including device 
   type, name, format of status information and model etc. of a 
   particular device to be used for identification purposes. 
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD 
   NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to 
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].  
    
    
3.   Scope and Limitations 
     
   Status information of a device is primarily the operating state, 
   availability and location of the device.  It is not the intent of 
   this draft to encode all these as status attributes and provide a 
   common format for all kind of devices.  In fact it would be very 
   difficult to define a single comprehensive ontology for all kinds of 
   Network-attached devices. The vendors can define their own device 
   specific status format. It is possible that a number of devices with 
   similar category MAY have the same status format. Even though we do 
   not define a common format for device status information but in this 
   document we define a basic set of static attributes that are common 
   to all kind of devices such as device name, type, manufacturer name, 
   name of the format of mode etc which we refer to as device profile 
   information.

4.   Event Package Definition 
    
   This section provides the details for defining a SIP specific event 
   package as defined in Section 5.4 of [2]. 
    
    
4.1. Event Package Name 
    
   The specification of SIP specific event package [2] requires event 
   package definition to specify the name of the Package. The token 
   name of this event package is:  
    
   "device-info" 
    
   This value appears in the event header present in SUBSCRIBE and 
   NOTIFY requests. 
    
   Example: 
    
   Event: device-info 
 
 
4.2. Event Package Parameters 
    
   No package specific Event header parameters are defined for this 
   event package. 
 
 
4.3. SUBSCRIBE Bodies 
    
   The SIP event specification [2] requires definitions of subscribe 
   bodies. The SUBSCRIBE message for device profile information does 
   not contain any body. A SUBSCRIBE for vendor defined device status 
   information MAY contain a body. The body will primarily be used for 
   the filtering of subscription. The definition of such subscription 
   body is outside the scope of this document. If the SUBSCRIBE message 
   does not contain any body then the default filtering policy will be 
   adopted. The rules for default filtering policy is as follows: 
    
     o Notifications are generated every time when there is a change 
        in the state of device status information. 
    
     o Notifications usually do not contain full state. They rather 
        indicate the state that has changed. However, notification 
        triggered from a response of SUBSCRIBE message will contain 
        full device status information.

Internet Draft               device-info             October 24, 2004 
    
    
4.4. SUBSCRIBE Duration 
    
   The  subscription  for  device  profile  information  is  a  one-time 
   subscription as device profile contains only static information and 
   does not change over time.  This one-time subscription is necessary 
   to find out vendor specific MIME type definition of device status 
   information, which can be used for subsequent subscription for 
   device status. So the "expires" header of SUBSCRIBE message for 
   device  profile  information  will  specify  "0"  duration  which  is 
   basically a fetch operation for device profile information. 
    
   Once,  device  profile  information  is  retrieved  using  the  fetch 
   operation, a subsequent SUBSCRIBE message should be sent to retrieve 
   device status information with "Accept" header indicating the vendor 
   specific MIME type name for the device status information. The event 
   package name for both device profile and status information is the 
   same, which is "device-info". A notifier can easily determine which 
   MIME type is requested from this subscription by looking at the 
   "Accept" header. The vendor specific MIME type name for device 
   status  information  will  be  contained  in  the  device  profile 
   information. The duration of subscription for device specific status 
   information May range from minutes to several hours. Subscriptions 
   in hours are more typical and recommended. The default subscription 
   duration for device status information is 1 hour. 
 
  
4.5. NOTIFY Bodies 
    
   The SIP specific event specification [2] requires package definition 
   to specify a set of allowed body types in NOTIFY message. RFC 3265 
   [2] also requires to specify the default value to be used when there 
   is no Accept header in the SUBSCRIBE request.  
    
   The body of notification message for a response to SUBSCRIBE message 
   for  device  profile  information  will  contain  Mime  Type  content 
   "application/device-profile+xml". As we are defining a single event 
   package for both device profile and device status information, the 
   determination of type of information is requested can be made by 
   looking at the Accept header of SUBSCRIBE message. As the Accept 
   header is being used to differentiate between data types, in order 
   to  implement  this  event  package  the  use  of  Accept  header  is 
   mandatory.  
    
4.6. Notifier Processing of Subscribe Requests 
    
   This section describes the processing to be performed by the 
   notifier upon receipt of a SUBSCRIBE request for the device-info 
   event package.

Internet Draft               device-info             October 24, 2004 
    
    
4.6.1.    Authentication 
    
   The contents of a device-info document contain sensitive information 
   about the devices in a SIP domain. Therefore, a notifier MUST 
   authenticate all subscription requests. This authentication can be 
   done using any of the mechanisms defined in RFC 3261 [4] and other 
   authentication extensions. 
    
4.6.2.    Authorization  
    
   A notifer MUST NOT accept a subscription unless authorization has 
   been provided for the device. Authorization may have been provided 
   ahead of time using any of the local access control mechanisms.  
    
4.7. Notifier Generation of Notify Requests 
    
   RFC 3265 describes the formatting and structure of NOTIFY messages. 
   However, packages are required to provide detailed information on 
   when to send a NOTIFY, how to compute the state of the resource, how 
   to generate neutral or fake state information, and whether state 
   information is complete or partial. This section describes this 
   information for device information event package. 
    
   A notifier MAY send a notify at any time. Typically, it will send 
   one at any time device status changes. The times at which NOTIFY is 
   sent for a particular subscriber, and the contents of the body in 
   that notification, are subject to any rules specified by the 
   authorization policy that governs the subscription.  
  
   In the case of a pending subscription, when final authorization is 
   determined, a NOTIFY can be sent.  If the result of the 
   authorization decision was success, a NOTIFY SHOULD be sent and 
   SHOULD contain a complete device status document with the device∆s 
   current status information.  If the subscription is rejected, a 
   NOTIFY MAY be sent. As described in RFC 3265, the Subscription-State 
   header field indicates the state of the subscription. 
 
   The body of the NOTIFY MUST be sent using one of the types listed in 
   the Accept header field in the most recent SUBSCRIBE request, or 
   using the type "application/device-profile+xml" if no Accept header 
   field was present. 
    
   Notifiers will typically act as Event State Compositors (ESC) and 
   thus, will learn the device-information event state via PUBLISH 
   requests sent from the user's Event Publication Agent (EPA) when the 
   user changes one of those settings.

Internet Draft               device-info             October 24, 2004 
    
    
   For reasons of privacy, it will frequently be necessary to encrypt 
   the contents of the notifications.  This can be accomplished using 
   S/MIME.  The encryption can be performed using the key of the 
   subscriber as identified in the From field of the SUBSCRIBE request. 
    
   Similarly, integrity of the notifications is important to 
   subscribers.  As such, the contents of the notifications MAY provide 
   authentication and message integrity using S/MIME.  Since the NOTIFY 
   is generated by the notifier, which may not have access to the key 
   of the device represented by the device-profile, it will frequently 
   be the case that the NOTIFY is signed by a third party.  It is 
   RECOMMENDED that the signature be by an authority over the domain to 
   which the device is connected. In other words, for a user 
   sip:user@abc.com, the signator of the NOTIFY SHOULD be the authority 
   for example.com. 
    
4.8. Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests 
    
   RFC 3265 leaves it to event packages to describe the process 
   followed by the subscriber upon receipt of a NOTIFY request, 
   including any logic required to form a coherent resource state. 
    
   In this specification, each NOTIFY request contains either no 
   Device-profile document, or a document representing one or more 
   device-profile related data.  Within a dialog, the device-profile 
   document in the NOTIFY request with the highest CSeq header field 
   value is the current one.  When no document is present in that 
   NOTIFY, the device-profile document present in the NOTIFY with the 
   next highest CSeq value is used. 
    
4.9. Rate of Notifications 
    
RFC 3265 requires each package to specify the maximum rate at 
which notifications can be sent. 
    
Device-profile notifiers SHOULD NOT generate notifications for a single 
device at a rate of more than once every five seconds. 
    
    
4.10.     State Agents 
      
RFC 3265 requires each package to consider the role of state agents in 
the package, and if they are used, to specify how authentication and 
authorization are done. 
    
This detail will be provided the next revision of this document.

8.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This memo calls for IANA to:  
   -  Register a new event package as per [2]. 
   -  Register a new MIME content-type application/device-profile+xml, 
      per [9], 
   -  Register a new XML namespace URN for device profile information 
      per [6].

9.   Security Considerations 
    
   The status information of a network-attached device MAY contain 
   sensitive information and hence a security mechanism is needed to 
   protect the content of status information document. We will consider 
   only securing the entire status document as element by element is 
   not required for the particular usage of the status document. Device 
   specific status information will be defined using MIME type by 
   individual  vendors  of  device  manufacturer.  S/MIME  [9]  provides 
   several security properties i.e., confidentiality, integrity and 
   authentication. S/MIME also provides end-to-end security. We do not 
   see any instance where device specific status information defined by 
   vendors needs to be modified in the middle by a proxy or a server 
   while communicating between two peers. So it is appropriate to use 
   S/MIME to provide end-to-end security.
