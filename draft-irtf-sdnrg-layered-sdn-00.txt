                Cooperating Layered Architecture for SDN
                    draft-irtf-sdnrg-layered-sdn-00

Abstract

   Software Defined Networking proposes the separation of the control
   plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its logical
   centralization on a control entity.  Most of the network intelligence
   is moved to this functional entity.  Typically, such entity is seen
   as a compendium of interacting control functions in a vertical, tight
   integrated fashion.  The relocation of the control functions from a
   number of distributed network nodes to a logical central entity
   conceptually places together a number of control capabilities with
   different purposes.  As a consequence, the existing solutions do not
   provide a clear separation between transport control and services
   that relies upon transport capabilities.

   This document describes a proposal named Cooperating Layered
   Architecture for SDN.  The idea behind that is to differentiate the
   control functions associated to transport from those related to
   services, in such a way that they can be provided and maintained
   independently, and can follow their own evolution path.

1.  Introduction

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) proposes the separation of the
   control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its
   logical centralization on a control entity.  A programmatic interface
   is defined between such entity and the network nodes, which
   functionality is supposed to perform traffic forwarding (only).
   Through that interface, the control entity instructs the nodes
   involved in the forwarding plane and modifies their traffic
   forwarding behavior accordingly.

   Most of the intelligence is moved to such functional entity.
   Typically, such entity is seen as a compendium of interacting control
   functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion.

   This approach presents a number of issues:

   o  Unclear responsibilities between actors involved in a service
      provision and delivery.

   o  Complex reuse of functions for the provision of services.

   o  Closed, monolithic control architectures.

   o  Difficult interoperability and interchangeability of functional
      components.

   o  Blurred business boundaries among providers.

   o  Complex service/network diagnosis and troubleshooting,
      particularly to determine which segment is responsible for a
      failure.

   The relocation of the control functions from a number of distributed
   network nodes to another entity conceptually places together a number
   of control capabilities with different purposes.  As a consequence,
   the existing solutions do not provide a clear separation between
   services and transport control.

Internet-Draft          Layered SDN Architecture              March 2016


   This document describes a proposal named Cooperating Layered
   Architecture for SDN (CLAS).  The idea behind that is to
   differentiate the control functions associated to transport from
   those related to services, in such a way that they can be provided
   and maintained independently, and can follow their own evolution
   path.

   Despite such differentiation it is required a close cooperation
   between service and transport layers and associated components to
   provide an efficient usage of the resources.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  Transport: denotes the transfer capabilities offered by a
      networking infrastructure.  The transfer capabilities can rely
      upon pure IP techniques, or other means such as MPLS or optics.

   o  Service: denote a logical construct that make use of transport
      capabilities.  This document does not make any assumption on the
      functional perimeter of a service that can be built above a
      transport infrastructure.  As such, a service can be an offering
      that is offered to customers or be invoked for the delivery of
      another (added-value) service.

   o  SDN intelligence: refers to the decision-making process that is
      hosted by a node or a set of nodes.  The intelligence can be
      centralized or distributed.  Both schemes are within the scope of
      this document.  The SDN intelligence relies on inputs form various
      functional blocks such as: network topology discovery, service
      topology discovery, resource allocation, business guidelines,
      customer profiles, service profiles, etc.  The exact decomposition
      of an SDN intelligence, apart from the layering discussed in this
      document, is out of scope.

   Additionally, the following acronyms are used in this document.

      SLA: Service Level Agreement

3.  Architecture overview

   Current operator networks support multiple services (e.g., VoIP,
   IPTV, mobile VoIP, critical mission applications, etc.) on a variety
   of transport technologies.  The provision and delivery of a service
   independently of the underlying transport capabilities requires a
   separation of the service related functionalities and an abstraction
   of the transport network to hide the specificities of underlying
   transfer techniques while offering a common set of capabilities.

   Such separation can provide configuration flexibility and
   adaptability from the point of view of either the services or the
   transport network.  Multiple services can be provided on top of a
   common transport infrastructure, and similarly, different
   technologies can accommodate the connectivity requirements of a
   certain service.  A close coordination among them is required for a
   consistent service delivery (inter-layer cooperation).

   This document focuses particularly on:

   o  Means to expose transport capabilities to external services.

   o  Means to capture service requirements of services.

   o  Means to notify service intelligence with underlying transport
      events, for example to adjust service decision-making process with
      underlying transport events.

   o  Means to instruct the underlying transport capabilities to
      accommodate new requirements, etc.

   An example is to guarantee some Quality of Service (QoS) levels.
   Different QoS-based offerings could be present at both service and
   transport layers.  Vertical mechanisms for linking both service and
   transport QoS mechanisms should be in place to provide the quality
   guarantees to the end user.

   CLAS architecture assumes that the logically centralized control
   functions are separated in two functional blocks or layers.  One of
   the functional blocks comprises the service-related functions,
   whereas the other one contains the transport-related functions.  The
   cooperation between the two layers is considered to be implemented
   through standard interfaces.

   Figure 1 shows the CLAS architecture.  It is based on functional
   separation in the NGN architecture defined by the ITU-T in [Y.2011].

   Two strata of functionality are defined, namely the Service Stratum,
   comprising the service-related functions, and the Transport Stratum,
   covering the transport ones.  The functions on each of these layers
   are further grouped on control, management and user (or data) planes.

            Figure 1: Cooperating Layered Architecture for SDN

   In the CLAS architecture both the control and management functions
   are the ones logically centralized in one or a set of SDN
   controllers, in such a way that separated SDN controllers are present

   in the Service and Transport strata.  Furthermore, the generic user
   or data plane functions included in the NGN architecture are referred
   here as resource plane functions.  The resource plane in each stratum
   is controlled by the corresponding SDN controller through a standard
   interface.

   The SDN controllers cooperate for the provision and delivery of
   services.  There is a hierarchy in which the Service SDN controller
   requests transport capabilities to the Transport SDN controller.
   Furthermore, the Transport SDN controller interacts with the Service
   SDN controller to inform it about events in the transport network
   that can motivate actions in the service layer.

   The Service SDN controller acts as a client of the Transport SDN
   controller.

   Despite it is not shown in the figure, the Resource planes of each
   stratum could be connected.  This will depend on the kind of service
   provided.  Furthermore, the Service stratum could offer an interface
   towards external applications to expose network service capabilities
   to those applications or customers.

   This document does assume that SDN techniques can be enabled jointly
   with other distributed means (e.g., IGP).

3.1.  Functional strata

   As described before, the functional split separates transport-related
   functions from service-related functions.  Both strata cooperate for
   a consistent service delivery.

   Consistecy is determined and characterized by the service layer.

   Communication between these two components could be implemented using
   a variety of means (such as
   [I-D.boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-protocol], Intermediate-
   Controller Plane Interface (I-CPI) [ONFArch], etc).

3.1.1.  Transport stratum

   The Transport stratum comprises the functions focused on the transfer
   of data between the communication end points (e.g., between end-user
   devices, between two service gateways, etc.).  The data forwarding
   nodes are controlled and managed by the Transport SDN component.  The
   Control plane in the SDN controller is in charge of instructing the
   forwarding devices to build the end to end data path for each
   communication or to make sure forwarding service is appropriately
   setup.  Forwarding may not be rely on the sole pre-configured

Internet-Draft          Layered SDN Architecture              March 2016


   entries; dynamic means can be enabled so that involved nodes can
   build dynamically routing and forwarding paths.  Finally, the
   Management plane performs management functions (i.e., FCAPS) on those
   devices, like fault or performance management, as part of the
   Transport stratum capabilities.

3.1.2.  Service stratum

   The Service stratum contains the functions related to the provision
   of services and the capabilities offered to external applications.
   The Resource plane consists of the resources involved in the service
   delivery, such as computing resources, registries, databases, etc.
   The Control plane is in charge of controlling and configuring those
   resources, as well as interacting with the Control plane of the
   Transport stratum in client mode for requesting transport
   capabilities for a given service.  In the same way, the Management
   plane implements management actions on the service-related resources
   and interacts with the Management plane in the Transport stratum for
   a cooperating management between layers.

3.1.3.  Recursiveness

   Recursive layering can happen in some usage scenarios in which the
   Transport Stratum is itself structured in Service and Transport
   Stratum.  This could be the case of the provision of a transport
   services complemented with advanced capabilities additional to the
   pure data transport (e.g., maintenance of a given SLA [RFC7297]).

3.2.  Plane separation

   The CLAS architecture leverages on the SDN proposition of plane
   separation.  As mentioned before, three different planes are
   considered for each stratum.  The communication among these three
   planes (and with the corresponding plane in other strata) is based on
   open, standard interfaces.

3.2.1.  Control Plane

   The Control plane logically centralizes the control functions of each
   stratum and directly controls the corresponding resources.  [RFC7426]
   introduces the role of the control plane in a SDN architecture.  This
   plane is part of an SDN controller, and can interact with other
   control planes in the same or different strata for accomplishing
   control functions.

Internet-Draft          Layered SDN Architecture              March 2016


3.2.2.  Management Plane

   The Management plane logically centralizes the management functions
   for each stratum, including the management of the Control and
   Resource planes.  [RFC7426] describes the functions of the management
   plane in a SDN environment.  This plane is also part of the SDN
   controller, and can interact with the corresponding management planes
   residing in SDN controllers of the same or different strata.

3.2.3.  Resource Plane

   The Resource plane comprises the resources for either the transport
   or the service functions.  In some cases the service resources can be
   connected to the transport ones (e.g., being the terminating points
   of a transport function) whereas in other cases it can be decoupled
   from the transport resources (e.g., one database keeping some
   register for the end user).  Both forwarding and operational planes
   proposed in [RFC7426] would be part of the Resource plane in this
   architecture.

4.  Required features

   A number of features are required to be supported by the CLAS
   architecture.

   o  Abstraction: the mapping of physical resources into the
      corresponding abstracted resources.

   o  Service parameter translation: translation of service parameters
      (e.g., in the form of SLAs) to transport parameters (or
      capabilities) according to different policies.

   o  Monitoring: mechanisms (e.g. event notifications) available in
      order to dynamically update the (abstracted) resources' status
      taking in to account e.g. the traffic load.

   o  Resource computation: functions able to decide which resources
      will be used for a given service request.  As an example,
      functions like PCE could be used to compute/select/decide a
      certain path.

   o  Orchestration: ability to combine diverse resources (e.g., IT and
      network resources) in an optimal way.

   o  Accounting: record of resource usage.

   o  Security: secure communication among components, preventing e.g.
      DoS attacks.

5.  Communication between SDN Controllers

   The SDN Controller residing respectively in the Service and the
   Transport Stratum need to establish a tight coordination.  Mechanisms
   for transfer relevant information for each stratum should be defined.

   From the Service perspective, the Service SDN controller needs to
   easily access transport resources through well defined APIs to access
   the capabilities offered by the Transport Stratum.  There could be
   different ways of obtainign such transport-aware information, i.e.,
   by discovering or publishing mechanisms.  In the former case the
   Service SDN Controller could be able of handling complete information
   about the transport capabilities (including resources) offered by the
   Transport Stratum.  In the latter case, the Transport Stratum exposes
   available capabilities e.g. through a catalog, reducing the amount of
   detail of the underlying network.

   On the other hand, the Transport Stratum requires to properly capture
   Service requirements.  These can include SLA requirements with
   specific metrics (such as delay), level of protection to be provided,
   max/min capacity, applicable resource constraints, etc.

   The communication between controllers should be also secure,
   preventing denial of service.

6.  Deployment scenarios

   Different situations can be found depending on the characteristics of
   the networks involved in a given deployment.

6.1.  Full SDN environments

   This case considers the fact that the networks involved in the
   provision and delivery of a given service have SDN capabilities.

6.1.1.  Multiple Service strata associated to a single Transport stratum

   A single Transport stratum can provide transfer functions to more
   than one Service strata.  The Transport stratum offers a standard
   interface to each of the Service strata.  The Service strata are the
   clients of the Transport stratum.  Some of the capabilities offered
   by the Transport stratum can be isolation of the transport resources
   (slicing), independent routing, etc.

6.1.2.  Single service stratum associated to multiple Transport strata

   A single Service stratum can make use of different Transport strata
   for the provision of a certain service.  The Service stratum
   interfaces each of the Transport strata with standard protocols, and
   orchestrates the provided transfer capabilities for building the end
   to end transport needs.

6.2.  Hybrid environments

   This case considers scenarios where one of the strata is legacy
   totally or in part.

6.2.1.  SDN Service stratum associated to a legacy Transport stratum

   An SDN service stratum can interact with a legacy Transport stratum
   through some interworking function able to adapt SDN-based control
   and management service-related commands to legacy transport-related
   protocols, as expected by the legacy Transport stratum.  The SDN
   controller in the Service stratum is not aware of the legacy nature
   of the underlying Transport stratum.

6.2.2.  Legacy Service stratum associated to an SDN Transport stratum

   A legacy Service stratum can work with an SDN-enabled Transport
   stratum through the mediation of and interworking function capable to
   interpret commands from the legacy service functions and translate
   them into SDN protocols for operating with the SDN-enabled Transport
   stratum.

6.3.  Multi-domain scenarios in Transport Stratum

   The Transport Stratum can be composed by transport resources being
   part of different administrative, topological or technological
   domains.  The Service Stratum can yet interact with a single entity
   in the Transport Stratum in case some abstraction capabilities are
   provided in the transport part to emulate a single stratum.

   Those abstraction capabilities constitute a service itself offered by
   the Transport Stratum to the services making use of it.  This service
   is focused on the provision of transport capabilities, then different
   of the final communication service using such capabilities.

   In this particular case this recursion allows multi-domain scenarios
   at transport level.

   Multi-domain situations can happen in both single-operator and multi-
   operator scenarios.  Multi-operator scenarios will be addressed in
   future versions of the document.

   In single operator scenarios a multi-domain or end-to-end abstraction
   component can provide an homogeneous abstract view of the underlying
   heterogeneous transport capabilities for all the domains.
