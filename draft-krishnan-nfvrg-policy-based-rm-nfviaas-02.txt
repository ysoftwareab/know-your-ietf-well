                              and Scheduling

             draft-krishnan-nfvrg-policy-based-rm-nfviaas-02

Abstract

   One of the goals of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is to
   offer the NFV infrastructure as a service to other SP customers -
   this is called NFVIaaS. Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployment in
   this paradigm will drive support for unique placement policies,
   given VNF's stringent service level specifications (SLS) required by
   customer SPs. Additionally, NFV DCs often have capacity, energy and
   other constraints - thus, optimizing the overall resource usage
   based on policy is an important part of the overall solution. The
   purpose of this document is to depict an architectural framework for
   policy based resource placement and scheduling in the context of
   NFVIaaS.

Internet-Draft NFVIaaS Policy Resource Placement & Scheduling  May 2015

1. Introduction

   One of the goals of NFV [ETSI-NFV-WHITE] is to offer the NFV
   infrastructure as a service to other SP customers - this is called
   NFVIaaS [ETSI-NFV-USE-CASES]. In this context, it may be desirable
   for a Service Provider to run virtual network elements (e.g.,
   virtual routers, virtual firewalls, and etc. - these are called
   Virtual Network Functions - VNF) as virtual machine instances inside
   the infrastructure of another Service Provider. In this document, we
   call the former a customer SP and the latter an NFVIaaS SP.

   There are many reasons for a customer SP to require the services of
   an NFVIaaS SP, including: to meet performance requirements (e.g.,
   latency or throughput) in locations where the customer SP does not
   have physical data center presence, to allow for expanded customer
   reach, regulatory requirements, and etc.

   As VNFs are virtual machines, their deployment in such NFVIaaS SPs
   would share some of the same placement restrictions (i.e., placement
   policies) as those intended for Cloud Services. However, VNF
   deployment will drive support for unique placement policies, given
   VNF's stringent service level specifications (SLS) required/imposed
   by customer SPs. Additionally, NFV DCs often have capacity, energy
   and other constraints - thus, optimizing the overall resource usage
   based on policy is an important part of the overall solution.

   The purpose of this document is to depict an architectural framework
   for policy based resource placement and scheduling in the context of
   NFVIaaS.

2. NFVIaaS Architectural Framework for Policy Based Resource Placement
   and Scheduling

   The policy engine performs policy-based resource placement and
   scheduling of Virtual Machines (VMs) in support for NFVIaaS. It
   determines optimized placement and scheduling choices based on the
   constraints specified in the policy. Figure 1 depicts the NFVIaaS
   Architectural Framework for Policy Based resource placement and
   scheduling.

   In one instantiation of this architecture, the policy engine would
   interface with the Measurement Collector to periodically retrieve
   instantaneous per-server CPU utilization, which it would then use to
   compute a table of per-server average CPU utilization. In an
   alternative instantiation of this architecture, the measurement
   collector could itself compute per-server average CPU utilization.
   The latter approach reduces overhead, since it avoids too frequent

   pulling of stats from Ceilometer. The policy engine evaluates such
   policies based on an event trigger or a based on a programmable
   timer.

   Other average utilization parameters such as VM CPU utilization, VM
   Memory utilization, VM disk read IOPS etc. could be used by the
   policy engine to enforce other types of placement policies.

3. System Analysis in a OpenStack Framework

   Consider an NFVIaaS SP that owns a multitude of mini NFV data
   centers managed by OpenStack [OPENSTACK] where,

   -  The Policy Engine function is performed by OpenStack Congress
     [OPENSTACK-CONGRESS-POLICY-ENGINE]

   -  The Measurement Collector function is performed by OpenStack
     Celiometer [OPENSTACK-CELIOMETER-MEASUREMENT]

   Exemplary Mini NFV DC configuration:

   An exemplary mini NFV DC configuration is depicted below.

   -  There are 210 physical servers in 2U rack server configuration
   spread over 10 racks.

   -  There are 4 types of physical servers each with a different
   system configuration and from a particular manufacturer. It is
   possible that the servers are from the same or different
   manufacturer. For the purpose of this example, server type 1 is
   described further. Server type 1 has 32 virtual CPUs and 128GB DRAM
   from manufacturer x. Assume 55 physical servers of type 1 per mini
   NFV DC.

   -  There are 2 types of instances large.2 and large.3, which are
   described in the table below. Each parameter has a minimum guarantee
   and a maximum usage limit.

   |--------|----------------- |-------------------|---------------|

   |Instance|Virtual CPU Units |Memory (GB)        |Minimum/Maximum|

   |Type    |Minimum Guarantee |Minimum Guarantee  |Physical Server|

   |        |/Maximum Usage    |/Maximum Usage     |Utilization (%)|

   |--------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|

   |large.2 |     0/4          |    0/16           |  0/12.5       |

   |large.3 |     0/8          |    0/32           |  0/25         |

   |--------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|

                     Table 1: NFVIaaS Instance Types

   For the purpose of this example, the Mini NFV DC topology is
   considered static -- the above topology, including the network
   interconnection, is available through a simple file-based interface.

   Policy 1 (an exemplary NFV policy):

   Policy 1 is an exemplary NFV policy. In a descriptive language,
   Policy 1 is as follows - "For physical servers of type 1, there can
   be at most only one physical server with average overall utilization
   less than 50%."

   The goal of this policy is to address the energy efficiency
   requirements described in the ETSI NFV Virtualization Requirements
   [ETSI-NFV-REQ].

   Various Module Interactions for Policy 1:

   The various module interactions with respect the architectural
   framework in Figure 1 for Policy 1 is described below.

   The policy calls for the identification of servers by type.
   OpenStack Congress would need to support server type, average CPU
   utilization, and be able to support additional performance
   parameters (in the future) to support additional types of placement
   policies. OpenStack Congress would run the policy periodically or
   based on events such as deleting/adding VMs etc. Initially, we could
   use a periodic timer based approach. In case OpenStack Congress
   detects a violation, it determines optimized placement and
   scheduling choices so that the policy is not violated.

   OpenStack Congress could interface with OpenStack Celiometer to
   periodically retrieve instantaneous per-server CPU utilization,
   which it would then use to compute a table of per-server average CPU
   utilization. Alternatively, OpenStack Celiometer could itself
   compute per-server average CPU utilization which could be used by
   OpenStack Congress.

   The proposed module interactions in this NFVIaaS placement policy
   example are as depicted in the architectural framework in Figure 1.

   A key goal of Policy 1 above is to ensure that servers are not kept
   under low utilization, since servers have a non-linear power profile
   and exhibit relatively higher power wastage at lower utilization.
   For example, in the active idle state as much as 30% of peak power
   is consumed. At the physical server level, instantaneous energy
   consumption can be accurately measured through IPMI standard. At a
   customer instance level, instantaneous energy consumption can be
   approximately measured using an overall utilization metric, which is
   a combination of CPU utilization, memory usage, I/O usage, and
   network usage. Hence, the policy is written in terms of overall
   utilization and not power usage.

Internet-Draft NFVIaaS Policy Resource Placement & Scheduling  May 2015

   For an exemplary maximum usage scenario, 53 physical servers could
   be under peak utilization (100%), 1 server (server-a) could be under
   partial utilization (50%) with 2 instances of type large.3, and 1
   server (server-b) could be under partial utilization (37.5%) with 3
   instances of type large.2.

   When one of the large.3 instances mapped to server-a is deleted from
   physical server type 1, Policy 1 will be violated, since the overall
   utilization of server-a falls to 25%.

   OpenStack Congress, on detecting the policy violation, uses various
   constraint based placement techniques to find the new placement(s)
   for physical server type 1 to address the policy violation.
   Constrained based placement will be explored in a convex
   optimization framework [CONVEX-OPT]; some of the algorithms which
   would be considered are linear programming [LINEAR-PROGRAM], branch
   and bound [BRANCH-AND-BOUND], interior point methods, equality
   constrained minimization, non-linear optimization etc.

   Various new placement(s) are described below.

   1) New placement 1: Move 2 instances of large.2 to server-a. Overall
   utilization of server-a - 50%. Overall utilization of server-b -
   12.5%.

   2) New placement 2: Move 1 instance of large.3 to server-b. Overall
   utilization of server-a - 0%. Overall utilization of server-b -
   62.5%.

   3) New placement 3: Move 3 instances of large.2 to server-a. Overall
   utilization of server-a - 62.5%. Overall utilization of server-b -
   0%.

   New placements 2 and 3 could be considered optimal, since they
   achieve maximal bin packing and open up the door for turning off
   server-a or server-b and maximizing energy efficiency.

   To detect violations of Policy 1, an example of a classification
   rule is expressed below in Datalog, the policy language used by
   OpenStack Congress.

   Database table exported by the Resource Placement and Scheduler for
   Policy 1:

   The database table exported by the Resource Placement and Scheduler
   for Policy 1 is below.

   server_utilization (physical_server, overall_util)

   -  Each database entry has the physical server and the calculated
   average overall utilization.

   Policy 1 (in Datalog [DATALOG] policy language):

   Policy 1 in a Datalog policy language is as follows.

   error (physical_server) :-

   nova [OPENSTACK-NOVA-COMPUTE]: node (physical_server, "type1"),

   resource placement and scheduler: server_utilization
   (physical_server, overall_util < 50)
