Internet Draft              Entity Sensor MIB            August 15, 2002


2.  Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes managed objects for extending the Entity MIB
(RFC2737) to provide generalized access to information related to
physical sensors, which are often found in networking equipment (such as
chassis temperature, fan RPM, power supply voltage).

4.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and

Internet Draft              Entity Sensor MIB            August 15, 2002


        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

5.  Overview

There is a need for a standardized way of obtaining information related
to the physical sensors which are commonly found in networking
equipment. Information such as the current value of the sensor, the
current operational status, and the data units precision associated with
the sensor, should be represented in a consistent manner for any type of
sensor.

Physical sensors are represented in the Entity MIB with entPhysicalEntry
and an entPhysicalClass value of 'sensor(8)'.  The information provided

Internet Draft              Entity Sensor MIB            August 15, 2002


in the ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB module (defined in this document) defines a
sparse augmentation of the entPhysicalTable, for entries which represent
physical sensors.

5.1.  Terms

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [RFC2119]

5.2.  Relationship to the Entity MIB

The MIB objects defined in this document provide a sparse augmentation
to the entPhysicalTable in the Entity MIB, for entries for which the
associated entPhysicalClass object is equal to 'sensor(8)'.  An agent is
expected to maintain an entSensorEntry with the same entPhysicalIndex
value for each entPhysicalEntry representing a physical sensor.
Therefore, implementation of the entityPhysicalGroup is required for
agents which implement the Entity Sensor MIB.

5.3.  Relationship to General Thresholding Mechanisms

There are no specialized sensor value thresholding mechanisms defined in
this MIB module.  Instead, it is recommended that a generalized
thresholding MIB, such as the mechanisms defined by the Alarm and Events
groups of the Remote Network Monitoring MIB [RFC2819], be used for this
purpose.

6.  MIB Structure

The Entity Sensor MIB contains a single group called the
entitySensorValueGroup, which provides objects to convey the current
value and status of a physical sensor.

The entitySensorValueGroup contains a single table, called the
entSensorTable, which provides a small number of read-only objects:

entSensorType
     This object identifies the type of data units associated with the
     sensor value.

entSensorScale
     This object identifies the (power of 10) scaling factor associated
     with the sensor value.

Internet Draft              Entity Sensor MIB            August 15, 2002


entSensorPrecision
     This object identifies the number of decimal places of precision
     associated with the sensor value.

entSensorValue
     This object identifies the current value of the sensor.

entSensorOperStatus
     This object identifies the current operational status of the sensor
     (as it's known to the agent).

entSensorUnitsDisplay
     This object provides a textual description of the data units
     represented by the entSensorType and entSensorScale objects.

entSensorValueTimeStamp
     The object identifies the value of sysUpTime at the time the agent
     last updated the information in the entry.  This object is only
     relevant if the agent uses a polling implementation strategy,
     (i.e., the associated entSensorValueUpdateRate object is greater
     than zero).

entSensorValueUpdateRate
     This object indicates the nature of the agent implementation of the
     entSensorEntry, and contains the (possibly estimated) number of
     milliseconds that elapse between polling updates of the information
     in the associated entry. The value zero indicates that the agent
     always return current data for the entry (as opposed to the data as
     it was at the last polling interval).

            The value 'nonoperational(3)' indicates that the agent
            believes the sensor is broken.  The sensor could have a hard
            failure (disconnected wire), or a soft failure such as out-
            of-range, jittery, or wildly fluctuating readings."

12.  Security Considerations

There is one managed object in this MIB that may contain sensitive
information. This is:

     entSensorValue

This object may expose the values of particular physical sensors for a
device.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
