Abstract

   This draft defines extension to the SCTP Socket API draft[1] for
   Congestion Handling. SCTP Protocol has been widely accepted by the
   VoIP forum. SIGTRAN protocols (M3UA/SUA/M2UA/M2PA etc) provide
   procedures for handling congestion notification from the SCTP Stack
   layer.

   This draft provides mechanism for SCTP applications to enable/
   disable notification of congestion indications over SCTP Socket
   Interface. This draft suggests notification to application at onset
   and abatement of congestion.

1. Introduction

   SCTP protocol is the transport layer protocol for the SIGTRAN and
   other VoIP protocols. Many of these protocols provide protocol
   procedures on receiving congestion notification from SCTP layer.
   This draft therefore proposes an interface for SCTP layer to notify
   its application for buffer congestion.

   This draft provides an interface for the application to enable
   congestion notification in the SCTP Stack. The draft also provides
   an interface for SCTP Stack layer to notify its application for send
   or receive buffer congestion. The interface provided for the
   application is in accordance with the IETF draft Sockets API
   Extensions for Stream Control Transmission Protocol[1].

2. Conventions

   This section lists the data types for the congestion extension to
   the socket draft.

                        for Congestion Handling

2.1 Data Types

   Data types are in accordance with the IETF draft for Sockets API
   Extensions for Stream Control Transmission Protocol[1]. Data types
   for congestion notifications are mentioned in later sections of this
   draft.

3. SCTP Congestion Event and Notification

   SCTP applications need to understand and process congestion event on
   notification from SCTP Stack. The detection of this event is on per
   association basis.

   If the application wants to receive the congestion notification, it
   sets appropriate socket option for SCTP congestion. When a
   notification arrives, recvmsg() returns the notification in the
   application-supplied data buffer via msg_iov, and sets
   MSG_NOTIFICATION in msg_flags.

   The delivery of notification with the data is as per IETF draft for
   Sockets API Extensions for Stream Control Transmission Protocol[1].

3.1 Changes in SCTP Notification Structure

   The notification structure is as per the IETF draft for Sockets API
   Extensions for Stream Control Transmission Protocol[1]. The element
   Ùsn_cong_eventˆ as shown below would be added to the union
   sctp_notification.

   union sctp_notification {
   struct {
          uint16_t sn_type;             /* Notification type. */
          uint16_t sn_flags;
          uint32_t sn_length;
          } sn_header;
   ‡‡
   ‡‡
   struct sctp_congestion_event  sn_cong_event;
   };

   sn_type field can additionally have value as

   SCTP_CONGESTION_EVENT: This notification indicates that the SCTP
   Stack layer has encountered or has abated the send/receive buffer
   congestion.

                        for Congestion Handling

   If the congestion is because of send buffers, the application in
   this case can slower the rate at which it is transmitting data or
   increase the number of transmit buffers.

   If the congestion is because of the receive buffers, this indicates
   that the rate of receiving messages from the peer is more than the
   rate at which application is reading data from the SCTP Stack.

3.2 SCTP_CONGESTION_EVENT

   When the SCTP Stack encounters buffer congestion for an association,
   this notification is given to the user.

   struct sctp_congestion_event {
              uint16_t sce_type;
              uint16_t sce_flags;
              uint32_t sce_length;
              uint16_t sce_buffer_type;
              uint16_t sce_cong_levl;
              uint16_t sce_buffer_levl;
              sctp_assoc_t sce_assoc_id;
          };

   sce_type: 16 bits (unsigned integer)

   It should be SCTP_CONGESTIION_EVENT.

   sce_flags: 16 bits (unsigned integer)

   Currently unused.

   sce_length: 32 bits (unsigned integer)

   This field is the total length of the notification data, including
   the notification header.

   sce_buffer_type: 16 bits (unsigned integer)

   This field indicates the type of buffer that is experiencing a
   change in congestion level. The type of buffer includes:

   Buffer Type                   Description
   ----------------              -----------
   SCTP_RECV_BUFFERS             Indicates Receive Buffers have
                                 encountered or abated congestion.

   SCTP_SEND_BUFFERS             Indicates Send Buffers have been
                                 encountered or abated congestion.

                        for Congestion Handling

   sce_cong_levl: 16 bits (unsigned integer)

   This field indicates the congestion level encountered by the SCTP
   Stack. This parameter can have following values

   Congestion Level              Description
   ----------------              -----------
   SCTP_CONGESTION_LEVL_0        Indicates no congestion.

   SCTP_CONGESTION_LEVL_1        Indicates congestion level 1 has
                                 reached.

   SCTP_CONGESTION_LEVL_2        Indicates congestion level 2 has
                                 reached.

   SCTP_CONGESTION_LEVL_3        Indicates congestion level 3 has
                                 reached.

   sce_buffer_levl: 16 bits (unsigned integer)

   This field indicates the buffer occupancy of the association
   corresponding to the congestion indication.

   sce_assoc_id : sizeof (sctp_assoc_t)

   The association id field, holds the identifier for the association.
   All notifications for a given association have the same association
   identifier.  For one-to-one style socket, this field is ignored.

4. SCTP Socket Options for Congestion

   This section describes the socket options that the application will
   have to invoke to enable or disable congestion notification to the
   application.

   For the one-to-many style sockets, an sctp_assoc_t structure
   (association ID) is used to identify the association instance that
   the operation affects.  So it must be set when using this style.

   The socket options are

   SCTP_RECV_CONGINFO
   SCTP_SEND_CONGINFO

   Both the options are Read and Write.

                        for Congestion Handling

4.1 Receive Congestion Parameters (SCTP_RECV_CONGINFO)

   This protocol parameter is used to configure the congestion level
   for the receive buffers.

   The following structure is used to access or modify the parameters

   struct sctp_conginfo {
          sctp_assoc_t           sci_assoc_id;
          sctp_cong_level_info   sci_level_1;
          sctp_cong_level_info   sci_level_2;
          sctp_cong_level_info   sci_level_3;
      };

   sci_level_1 ° percentage of bytes utilized of the receive buffer for
   onset and abatement of congestion level 1.

   sci_level_2 ° percentage of bytes utilized of the receive buffer for
   onset and abatement of congestion level 2.

   sci_level_3 ° percentage of bytes utilized of the receive buffer for
   onset and abatement of congestion level 3.

   sci_assoc_id   - (one-to-many style socket) This is filled in the
   application, and identifies the association for this query. If this
   parameter is '0' (on a one-to-many style socket), then the change
   effects the entire endpoint.

   struct sctp_cong_level_info {
          uint8_t                scil_onset;
          uint8_t                scil_abate;
      };

   scil_onset ° Indicates onset threshold level of the specified
   congestion region. This indicates the percentage of bytes of the
   receive buffer used in order for the congestion level to be raised
   from a lower level to a higher level.

   scil_abate ° Indicates abate threshold level of the specified
   congestion region. This indicates the percentage of bytes used of
   the receive buffer in order for the congestion level to be reduced
   from the current level to the lower level. This needs to be less
   than or equal to the percentage specified in scil_onset of the same
   level.

   In order to avoid hysteresis of congestion level change, it is
   advisable to set the scil_onset higher than the scil_abate of the
   same level.

                        for Congestion Handling

   All parameters are specified in terms of percentage of bytes used
   for an association. A value of 0, when modifying the parameters
   indicates that the current value should not be changed.

   For the level specified, the SCTP stack will give an indication to
   the application when the indicated percentage of bytes is occupied.

   To access or modify these parameters, the application should call
   getsockopt() or setsockopt() respectively with the option name
   SCTP_RECV_CONGINFO.

4.2 Send Congestion Parameters (SCTP_SEND_CONGINFO)

   This protocol parameter is used to configure the congestion level
   for the receive buffers.

   The following structure is used to access or modify the parameters

   struct sctp_conginfo {
          sctp_assoc_t           sci_assoc_id;
          sctp_cong_level_info   sci_level_1;
          sctp_cong_level_info   sci_level_2;
          sctp_cong_level_info   sci_level_3;
      };

   sci_level_1 ° percentage of bytes utilized of the send buffer for
   onset and abatement of congestion level 1.

   sci_level_2 ° percentage of bytes utilized of the send buffer for
   onset and abatement of congestion level 2.

   sci_level_3 ° percentage of bytes utilized of the send buffer for
   onset and abatement of congestion level 3.

   sci_assoc_id   - (one-to-many style socket) This is filled in the
   application, and identifies the association for this query. If this
   parameter is '0' (on a one-to-many style socket), then the change
   effects the entire endpoint.

   struct sctp_cong_level_info {
          uint8_t                scil_onset;
          uint8_t                scil_abate;
      };

   scil_onset ° Indicates onset threshold level of the specified
   congestion region. This indicates the percentage of bytes used in
   order for the congestion level to be raised from a lower level to a
   higher level.

                        for Congestion Handling

   scil_abate ° Indicates abate threshold level of the specified
   congestion region. This indicates the percentage of bytes used in
   order for the congestion level to be reduced from the current level
   to the lower level. This needs to be less than or equal to the
   percentage specified in scil_onset of the same level.

   In order to avoid hysteresis of congestion level change, it is
   advisable to set the scil_onset higher than the scil_abate of the
   same level.

   All parameters are specified in terms of percentage of bytes used
   for an association. A value of 0, when modifying the parameters
   indicates that the current value should not be changed.

   For the level specified, the SCTP stack will give an indication to
   the application when the indicated percentage of bytes is occupied.

   To access or modify these parameters, the application should call
   getsockopt() or setsockopt() respectively with the option name
   SCTP_SEND_CONGINFO.

4.3 Error Codes

   Following error codes would be returned if invalid values of the
   congestion level are specified.

   1.EINVLVL1PARAMS ° If the onset and abate values of the congestion
   level 1 are invalid with respect to the other congestion levels.

   2.EINVLVL2PARAMS ° If the onset and abate values of the congestion
   level 2 are invalid with respect to the other congestion levels.

   3.EINVLVL3PARAMS ° If the onset and abate values of the congestion
   level 3 are invalid with respect to the other congestion levels.

5. Subscribing Congestion Notification

   Application can subscribe to the SCTP Congestion Notification by
   invoking the following option

   1. SCTP_RECV_CONGESTION_NOTIFICATION (sctp_recv_congestion_event)
   2. SCTP_SEND_CONGESTION_NOTIFICATION (sctp_send_congestion_event)

   To enable these notifications, application will have to register for
   these events using setsockopt() function. Following change will be
   required in the sctp_event_subscribe structure to subscribe to these
   notifications.

   struct sctp_event_subscribe{

                        for Congestion Handling

   ‡‡
   ‡‡
   uint8_t sctp_recv_congestion_event;
   uint8_t sctp_send_congestion_event;
   };

   sctp_recv_congestion_event - Setting this flag to 1 will enable the
   reception of receive buffers congestion event notifications.
   Setting the flag to 0 will disable receive buffers congestion event
   notifications.

   sctp_send_congestion_event - Setting this flag to 1 will enable the
   reception of transmit buffers congestion event notifications.
   Setting the flag to 0 will disable transmit buffers congestion event
   notifications.

   When the application subscribes to the recv/send congestion event,
   the congestion levels are initialised with system dependent default
   values.

   Implementation can sent to the default value of the congestion level
   1 to be 40%, level 2 to be 60% and level 3 to be 80% of the
   Send/Receive buffer occupancy. These values can be modified using
   socket options as explained in section 4.

6. Implementation Details

   The buffer utilisation for an association is divided into multiple
   congestion regions as shown in the figure below.

   The level 0 is a no-congestion region. Congestion indication with
   level 0 indicates system is not congested.

   Corresponding to every congestion region, there is a Onset threshold
   value and Abate threshold value.

   When the stack memory usage increases from the low congestion region
   to the higher congestion region, the SCTP layer will give the
   congestion notification for the Onset threshold value reached for
   the higher congestion region.

   When the stack memory usage decreases from the higher congestion
   region to the lower congestion region, then SCTP layer will give the
   congestion notification for the Abate threshold value reached for
   the lower congestion region.
