  1. Introduction 


       This specification supplements [RFC 3279], 
       "Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 
       Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and 
       Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" and 
       extends the list of algorithms defined for use in 
       the Internet PKI. This document specifies 
       algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 [X.690] encoding 
       rules for DSA and ECDSA digital signatures in 
       certificates and CRLs when using one of the SHA2 
       hash algorithms (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and 
       SHA-512) as the hash algorithm. 

       This specification defines the contents of the 
       signatureAlgorithm, signatureValue and signature 
       fields within Internet X.509 certificates and CRLs 
       when these objects are signed using DSA or ECDSA 
       with a SHA2 hash algorithm. These fields are more 
       fully described in [RFC 5280]. 

       This document profiles material presented in the 
       "Secure Hash Standard" [FIPS 180-3], "Public Key 
       Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: 
       The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Standard 
       (ECDSA)" [X9.62], and the "Digital Signature 
       Standard" [FIPS 186-3].    
        
       Algorithm identifiers and encoding rules for RSA, 
       DSA and ECDSA when used with SHA-1 are specified 
       in [RFC 3279]. Algorithm identifiers and encoding 
       rules for RSA when used with SHA2 hash algorithms 
       are specified in [RFC 4055].  

  2. One-way Hash Functions 

       This section identifies four additional hash 
       algorithms for use with DSA and ECDSA in the 
       Internet X.509 certificate and CRL profile [RFC 
       5280].

  Internet-Draft          DSA/ECDSA               March 2009 
  

       SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 produce a 
       224-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit and 512-bit "hash" of 
       the input respectively and are fully described in 
       the Federal Information Processing Standard 180-3 
       [FIPS  180-3]. 

       The listed one-way hash functions are identified 
       by the following object identifiers (OIDs):  

           id-sha224  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-
           iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) 
           organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 
           nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 4 } 

           id-sha256  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-
           iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) 
           organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 
           nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 1 } 

           id-sha384  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-
           iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) 
           organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 
           nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 2 } 

           id-sha512  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-
           iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) 
           organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 
           nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 3 } 

       When one of these OIDs appears in an 
       AlgorithmIdentifier, all implementations MUST 
       accept both NULL and absent parameters as legal 
       and equivalent encodings. 

  3. Signature Algorithms 

       Certificates and CRLs conforming to [RFC 5280] may 
       be signed with any public key signature algorithm. 
       The certificate or CRL indicates the algorithm 
       through an identifier, which appears in the 
       signatureAlgorithm field within the Certificate or 
       CertificateList. This algorithm identifier is an 
       OID and has optionally associated parameters. This 
       section denotes algorithm identifiers and 
       parameters that MUST be used in the 
       signatureAlgorithm field in a Certificate or 
       CertificateList.

       Signature algorithms are always used in 
       conjunction with a one-way hash function. This 
       section identifies OIDs for DSA and ECDSA with 
       SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. The 
       contents of the parameters component for each 
       signature algorithm vary; details are provided for 
       each algorithm. 

       The data to be signed (e.g., the one-way hash 
       function output value) is formatted for the 
       signature algorithm to be used. Then, a private  
       key operation (e.g., DSA encryption) is performed 
       to generate the signature value. This signature 
       value is then ASN.1 encoded as a BIT STRING and 
       included in the Certificate or CertificateList in 
       the signature field. More detail on how digital 
       signatures are generated can be found in [FIPS 
       186-3]. 

       Entities that validate DSA signatures MUST support 
       SHA-224 and SHA-256. Entities that validate ECDSA 
       signatures MUST support SHA-224 and SHA-256 and 
       should support SHA-384 and SHA-512.    

       3.1  DSA Signature Algorithm 

       The DSA is defined in the Digital Signature 
       Standard (DSS) [FIPS 186-3]. DSA was developed by 
       the U.S. Government, and can be used in 
       conjunction with a SHA2 one-way hash function such 
       as SHA-224 or SHA-256. DSA is fully described in 
       [FIPS 186-3]. 

       [FIPS 186-3] specifies four size-choices for a DSA 
       key pair of the form (public key size, private key 
       size) in bits. The four choices are (1024, 160), 
       (2048, 224), (2048, 256), and (3072, 256). More  
       information can be found in [FIPS 186-3]. For the 
       remainder of this specification, each and every 
       key pair of the DSA key pairs is referred to by 
       the size of its public key. 

       DSA key pairs of 1024 and 2048 bits may be used 
       with SHA-224. DSA key pairs of any of the four 
       sizes may use SHA-256. The following are the OIDs 
       of the DSA digital signature algorithm when used 
       with SHA-224 or SHA-256.

  Internet-Draft          DSA/ECDSA                 March 2009 
  

       When SHA-224 is used, the OID is: 

           id-dsa-with-sha224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { 
           joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) 
           organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) algorithms(4) 
           id-dsa-with-sha2(3) 1 }. 

       When SHA-256 is used, the OID is: 

           id-dsa-with-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { 
           joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) 
           organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) algorithms(4) 
           id-dsa-with-sha2(3) 2 }. 

       The DSA key pair of 3072 bits provides 128 bits of 
       security and provides the most security among all 
       the four sizes of DSA key pairs. More information 
       on security strength assessments of DSA and other 
       cryptographic algorithms can be found in [SP 800-
       57]. A digital signature algorithm has the same 
       security strength as its asymmetric key algorithm 
       like DSA or ECDSA only if its hashing algorithm 
       has at least the same security strength as the 
       asymmetric key algorithm. Therefore, a 128-bit 
       security strength hashing algorithm which is SHA-
       256 will be sufficient to build a 128-bit security 
       strength DSA digital signature algorithm when the 
       DSA key pair of 3072 bits is used. Therefore, it 
       is only needed to specify DSA with SHA-224 and 
       SHA-256 because SHA-256 provides sufficient 
       security for using with any DSA key pair of any of 
       the four size choices. More information on 
       security strengths of the hash functions SHAs 
       specified in [FIPS 180-3] and the digital 
       signature algorithms specified in [FIPS 186-3] can 
       be found in [SP 800-107] and [SP 800-57]. 

       When the id-dsa-with-sha224 or id-dsa-with-sha256 
       algorithm identifier appears in the algorithm 
       field as an AlgorithmIdentifier, the encoding 
       SHALL omit the parameters field. That is, the 
       AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one 
       component, the OID id-dsa-with-sha224 or id-dsa-
       with-sha256.  

       Encoding rules for DSA signature values are 
       specified in [RFC 3279]. For completeness, this 
       information is repeated below:

  Internet-Draft          DSA/ECDSA                March 2009 
  

       When signing, the DSA algorithm generates two 
       values commonly referred to as r and s. To easily 
       transfer these two values as one signature, they 
       SHALL be ASN.1 encoded using the following ASN.1  
       structure: 

            Dss-Sig-Value  ::=  SEQUENCE  { 
                                            r  INTEGER, 
                                            s  INTEGER   
                                          }. 
        
       The DSA parameters in the subjectPublicKeyInfo 
       field of the certificate of the issuer SHALL apply 
       to the verification of the signature. 

       3.2  ECDSA Signature Algorithm 

       The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm 
       (ECDSA) is defined in, "Public Key Cryptography 
       for the Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic 
       Curve Digital Signature Standard (ECDSA)" [X9.62]. 
       The ASN.1 OIDs used to specify that an ECDSA 
       signature was generated using SHA-224, SHA-256, 
       SHA-384 or SHA-512 are respectively:    
        
           ecdsa-with-SHA224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
           iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-
           62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 1 
           } 

           ecdsa-with-SHA256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
           iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-
           62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 2 
           } 

           ecdsa-with-SHA384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
           iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-
           62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 3 
           } 

           ecdsa-with-SHA512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
           iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-
           62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 4 
           } 

       When the ecdsa-with-SHA224, ecdsa-with-SHA256, 
       ecdsa-with-SHA384 or ecdsa-with-SHA512 algorithm 
       identifier appears in the algorithm field as an 
       AlgorithmIdentifier, the encoding MUST omit the 
       parameters field. That is, the AlgorithmIdentifier 
          
  Dang, et al.    Expires September 6, 2009          [Page 7] 
  
  Internet-Draft          DSA/ECDSA                March 2009 
  

       SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, the OID 
       ecdsa-with-SHA224, ecdsa-with-SHA256, ecdsa-with-
       SHA384 or ecdsa-with-SHA512.   

       Conforming CA implementations MUST specify the 
       hash algorithm explicitly, using the OIDs 
       specified above, when encoding ECDSA/SHA2 
       signatures in certificates and CRLs. 

       Conforming client implementations that process 
       ECDSA signatures with any of the SHA-2 hash 
       algorithms when processing certificates and CRLs 
       MUST recognize the corresponding OIDs specified 
       above.  

       [X9.62] has defined additional OIDs for the ECDSA 
       signature algorithm. 

       Encoding rules for ECDSA signature values are 
       specified in [RFC 3279]. For completeness, this 
       information is repeated below:  

       When signing, the ECDSA algorithm generates two 
       values commonly referred to as r and s. To easily 
       transfer these two values as one signature, they 
       MUST be ASN.1 encoded using the following ASN.1  
       structure: 

            Ecdsa-Sig-Value  ::=  SEQUENCE { 
                                            r  INTEGER, 
                                            s  INTEGER 
                                           }. 
        
       The elliptic curve parameters in the 
       subjectPublicKeyInfo field of the certificate of 
       the issuer MUST be applied to the verification of 
       the signature. The subjectPublicKeyInfo field must 
       be compliant with requirements for Subject Public 
       Key Information field in [Elliptic].

  5. Security Considerations 


       This specification supplements [RFC 3279]. This 
       document covers the DSA and ECDSA algorithms with 
       SHA2 hash functions and the associated 
       considerations.  
        
       The appropriate use of the hash functions in terms 
       of the algorithm strengths and expected time 
       frames for secure use as defined by NIST can be 
       found in Special Publications (SPs) 800-78-1 [SP 
       800-78-1], 800-57 [SP 800-57] and 800-107 [SP 800-
       107].    
          
       FIPS 186-3 fully specifies the DSA digital 
       signature algorithm and defines security 
       requirements for the DSA and ECDSA digital 
       signature algorithms; details can be found in 
       [FIPS 186-3]. ECDSA is fully specified in [X9.62]. 
       [FIPS 186-3] also specifies three types of 
       elliptic curves for use in conjunction with one of 
       the described hash functions: curves over prime 
       fields, curves over binary fields, and Koblitz 
       curves (anomalous binary curves). FIPS 186-3 
       provides a table listing the uses and time periods 
       for each algorithm and key size combinations for 
       various applications. The DSA and ECDSA private 
       keys must be generated from pseudorandom functions 
       whose security strengths meet or exceed the 
       desired security strengths for the digital 
       signature algorithms. Guidelines on building these 
       NIST-approved pseudorandom functions can be found 
       in SP 800-90 [SP 800-90]. The hash functions must 
       meet or exceed the desired security strengths of 
       the digital signature algorithms. More guidelines 
       can be found in SP 800-57 [SP 800-57] and SP 800-
       107 [SP 800-107].

       The one-way hash algorithms discussed in this 
       document, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 
       each have a recommended lifetime when used in 
       combination with a digital signature algorithm. 
       NIST provides information on the appropriate time 
       periods for which each combination should be used 
       based upon the security needs of the service and 
       information being protected in NIST Special 
       Publication 800-57. A table outlines the year in 
       which NIST deems it is no longer safe to use 
       specific combinations of key lengths and 
       algorithms of various strengths for RSA, DSA, and 
       ECDSA. NIST also provides Recommendation for using 
       NIST-approved hash algorithms in the digital 
       signature applications in [SP 800-107].  
          
       The Special Publication 800-57 also provides 
       guidelines for key management to be used by both 
       developers and system administrators. The document 
       covers the aspects of key management from 
       algorithm selection and key sizes with associated 
       key usage period to key usage (preventing key 
       overlap), the compromise of keys and keying 
       material, and key destruction. Specific guidelines 
       are offered for key usage periods such as the 
       lifetime of a private signature key may be shorter 
       than the lifetime of the public verification key 
       for practical applications. The specification also 
       provides recommendations on the number of years 
       various key types should be used such as public 
       and private signature keys, public and private 
       authentication keys, etc.  
        
       NIST Special Publication 800-78-1 also lists time 
       frames for the use of combined hash algorithms and 
       digital signature algorithms for specific key 
       types, but differentiates some security 
       requirements between digital signature and 
       authentication keys. The recommendation for the 
       size of digital signature keys and key management 
       keys is more restrictive than that of 
       authentication keys, because they are used to 
       protect data for longer periods of time.  
       Therefore, the transition dates to larger key 
       sizes are earlier in general. Guidelines for the 
       protection of domain parameters, initialization 
       vectors (IVs), and per message secret numbers for 
       use with digital signature algorithms, DSA and 
       ECSDA are provided in [FIPS 186-3]. An assurance

       of integrity should be obtained prior to using all 
       keying material for the generation of digital 
       signatures using DSA and ECDSA. Recommendation for 
       Obtaining Assurances for Digital Signature 
       Applications can be found in [SP 800-89]. The 
       purpose of this is to ensure the keying material 
       is in the proper format, the domain parameters are 
       valid, the possession of the private key, the 
       validity of the public key, and that the request 
       is coming from an authorized source.   
          
       Certificate Authorities (CAs) that issue 
       certificates using the DSA and ECDSA algorithms 
       for key generation SHOULD adhere to the 
       recommended security guidelines for key management 
       in the NIST Special Publication 800-57. When 
       signing a digital signature certificate, a CA 
       should use the same or greater size hash function 
       than the hash function in the digital signature 
       algorithm in the certificate.
