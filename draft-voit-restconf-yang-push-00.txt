        Restconf subscription and HTTP push for YANG datastores
                    draft-voit-restconf-yang-push-00

Abstract

   This document defines Restconf subscription and push mechanisms to
   continuously stream information from YANG datastores over HTTP.
   These mechanisms allow client applications or operations support
   systems to request custom sets of updates from a YANG datastore.
   This document also specifies how to stream updates over HTTP without
   Restconf.  In either case, updates are pushed by a datastore to a
   receiver per a subscription policy, without requiring continuous
   requests.

1.  Introduction

   Requirements for subscriptions to YANG datastores are defined in
   [pub-sub-reqs].  Mechanisms to support YANG subscriptions and
   datastore object push over a NETCONF are defined in
   [netconf-yang-push].  Restconf support of subscriptions, with HTTP
   transport of pushed updates is also needed by the market.  This
   document provides such a specification.

   Key benefits of pushing data via HTTP include:

   o  Ability to configure static subscriptions on a Publisher




Voit, et al.             Expires April 15, 2016                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                Restconf Push                 October 2015


   o  Ability for the Publisher to initiate communications with the
      Receiver

   o  Ability of a Subscriber to be different from the Receiver

   There are also additional benefits which can be realized when pushing
   updates via HTTP/2 [RFC7540]:

   o  Subscription multiplexing over independent HTTP/2 streams

   o  Stream prioritization

   o  Stream dependencies

   o  Flow control on independent streams

   o  Header compression

   These additional benefits will address issues resulting from head-of-
   line blocking and relative subscription priority.

   To maximize transport independence of YANG subscription methods, this
   document reuses many capabilities of [netconf-yang-push][] including:

   o  Operations for creating, modifying and deleting subscriptions

   o  Syntax and parameters for negotiating the subscription

   o  YANG data model to manage subscriptions

   o  Mechanisms to communicate subscription filters and data streams

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Datastore: a conceptual store of instantiated management information,
   with individual data items represented by data nodes which are
   arranged in hierarchical manner.

   Dynamic YANG Subscription: Subscription negotiated with Publisher via
   create, modify, and delete control plane signaling messages.

   Publisher: an entity responsible for distributing subscribed YANG
   object data per the terms of a Subscription.  In general, a Publisher

Internet-Draft                Restconf Push                 October 2015


   is the owner of the YANG datastore that is subjected to the
   Subscription.

   Receiver: the target where a Publisher pushes updates.  In many
   deployments, the Receiver and Subscriber will be the same entity.

   Static YANG Subscription: A Subscription installed via a
   configuration interface.

   Subscriber: An entity able to request and negotiate a contract for
   push updates from a Publisher.

   Subscription: A contract between a Subscriber and a Publisher,
   stipulating which information the Receiver wishes to have pushed from
   the Publisher without the need for further solicitation.

   Subscription Update: Set of data nodes and object values pushed
   together as a unit and intended to meet the obligations of a single
   subscription at a snapshot in time.

3.  Solution

   This document specifies mechanisms that allow subscribed information
   updates to be pushed from a YANG datastore.  Subscriptions may either
   be initiated via requests by Subscribers, or statically configured on
   a Publisher.  As in [netconf-yang-push], Publisher must respond to a
   subscription request explicitly positively or negatively.  Negative
   responses will include information about why the Subscription was not
   accepted, in order to facilitate converging on an acceptable set of
   Subscription parameters.

   Once a Subscription has been established, updates are pushed to the
   Receiver until the Subscription terminates.  Based on parameters
   within the Subscription, these updates can be streamed immediately as
   any subscribed objects change, or sent periodically.

3.1.  Subscription Model

   Subscriptions use the base data model from [netconf-yang-push].  This
   model is extended with several optional parameters for Subscription
   Priority and Subscription Dependency.  These parameters allow a
   Subscriber or other configuration interface to assert how it prefers
   the Publisher allocate resources when handling multiple
   Subscriptions.  These parameters are intended to be used in
   conjunction with the transport layer.  Specifically, when a new
   Subscription is being established with an underlying transport is
   HTTP/2, these parameters may be directly mapped into HTTP/2 to

   prioritize transport and to assist with flow control of individual
   streams.

3.2.  Subscription states at Publisher

   Below is the state machine for the Publisher.  It is important to
   note that a Subscription doesn't exist at the Publisher until it is
   accepted and made active.  The assertion of a <create-subscription>
   by a Subscriber is insufficient for that asserted subscription to be
   externally visible via this state machine.

   Subscription states at Publisher

                    .-------.
                    | start |
                    '-------'
                        |
                     create
                        |
                        |   .----------modify-------------.
                        v   v                              '
                  .-----------.                      .-----------.
       .--------. |           |------>suspend------->|           |
     modify      '|  active   |                      | suspended |
       '--------->|           |<----reactivate<------|           |
                  '-----------'                      '-----------'
                        |                                  |
                     delete                             delete
                        |                                  |
                        v                                  |
                    .-------.                              |
                    |  end  |<-----------------------------'
                    '-------'

   Of interest in this state machine are the following:

   o  Successful <create-subscription> or <modify-subscription> actions
      must put the subscription into an active state.

   o  Failed <modify-subscription> actions will leave the subscription
      in its previous state, with no visible change to any streaming
      updates.

   o  A <delete-subscription> action will delete the entire
      subscription.

3.3.  Mechanisms for Subscription Establishment and Maintenance

   On a Publisher, it must be possible to instantiate a Subscription via
   dynamic Subscriber signaling, as well as via Static configuration.

   Dynamic YANG Subscriptions are signaled Subscriptions aimed at the
   running datastore and are unable to impact the startup configuration.
   They should always terminate when there is loss of transport session
   connectivity between the Publisher and Receiver.

   Static Subscriptions are applied via an operations interface to the
   startup and running configurations.  Loss or non-availability of
   transport session connectivity will place the Subscription into the
   suspended state.  Logic beyond the scope of this specification will
   dictate when any particular Subscription should be reactivated.
   There are three models for Subscription establishment and
   maintenance:

   1.  Dynamic YANG Subscription: Subscriber and Receiver are the same

   2.  Static YANG Subscription

   3.  Dynamic YANG Subscription: Subscriber and Receiver are different

   The first two are described in this section.  The third is described
   in Appendix A.  This third option can be moved into the body of this
   specification should the IETF community desire.  In theory, all three
   models may be intermixed in a single deployment.  Figure 2 shows such
   a scenario.

3.3.1.  Dynamic YANG Subscription: Subscriber and Receiver are the same

   With all Dynamic YANG Subscriptions, as with [netconf-yang-push] it
   must be possible to configure and manage Subscriptions via signaling.
   This signaling is transported over [restconf].  Once established,
   streaming Subscription Updates are then delivered via Restconf SSE.

3.3.2.  Static YANG Subscription

   With a Static YANG Subscription, all information needed to establish
   a secure object push relationship with that Receiver must be
   configured via a configuration interface on the Publisher.  This
   information includes all the <create-subscription> information
   identified in section 3.3.1.  This information also includes the
   Receiver address, encoding selection, and any security credentials
   required to establish TLS between the Publisher and Receiver.
   Mechanisms for locally configuring these parameters are outside the
   scope of this document.

   With this information, the Publisher will establish a secure
   transport connection with the Receiver and then begin pushing the
   streaming updates to the Receiver.  Since Restconf might not exist on
   the Receiver, it is not desirable to require that updates be pushed
   via Restconf.  In place of Restconf, a TLS secured HTTP Client
   connection must be established with an HTTP Server located on the
   Receiver.  Subscription Updates will then be sent via HTTP Post
   messages to the Receiver.

   Post messages will be addressed to HTTP augmentation code on the
   Receiver capable accepting and responding to Subscription Updates.
   At least the initial Post message must include the URI for the
   subscribed resource.  This URI can be retained for future use by the
   Receiver.

   After successful receipt of an initial Subscription Update for a
   particular Subscription, this augmentation should reply back with an
   HTTP status code of 201 (Created).  Further successful receipts
   should result in the return of code of 202 (Accepted).  At any point,
   receipt of any status codes from 300-510 with the exception of 408
   (Request Timeout) should result in the movement of the Subscription
   to the suspended state.  A sequential series of multiple 408
   exceptions should also drive the Subscription to a suspended state.

   Security on an HTTP client/Publisher can be strengthened by only
   accepting Response code feedback for recently initiated HTTP POSTs.

   Figure 3 depicts this message flow.

           |<----------------------------->|

   If HTTP/2 transport is available to a Receiver, the Publisher should
   also:

   o  point individual Subscription Updates to a unique HTTP/2 stream
      for that Subscription,

   o  take any subscription-priority and provision it into the HTTP/2
      stream priority, and

   o  take any subscription-dependency and provision it into the HTTP/2
      stream dependency.

3.4.  Negotiation of Subscription Policies

   When using signaling to create a Dynamic YANG Subscription,
   negotiable parameters will include the same negotiable parameters
   defined within [netconf-yang-push].

   Additionally, negotiation may also include Subscription Priority.  A
   Publisher may accept a Subscriber asserted Priority, as well as
   rejecting a subscription with a hint at what priority might be
   accepted.

3.5.  Support for Periodic and On-change

   Implementations must support periodic and/or on-change subscriptions
   as defined in [netconf-yang-push].

Internet-Draft                Restconf Push                 October 2015


3.6.  Filters and Streams

   Implementations must support filters and streams as defined in
   [netconf-yang-push].

3.7.  Authorization

   Same authorization model for data as [netconf-yang-push] will be
   used.  This includes functions of the Netconf Access Control Model
   [RFC6536] applied to objects to be pushed via Restconf.

   A Subscription (including a Static YANG Subscription) may only be
   established if the Subscriber or some entity statically configuring
   via the Publisher's operational interface has read access to the
   target data node.

3.8.  Subscription Multiplexing

   When pushed directly over HTTP/2, it is expected that each
   Subscription Update will be allocated a separate Stream.  The will
   enable multiplexing, and address issues of Head-of-line blocking with
   different priority Subscriptions.

   When pushed via Restconf over HTTP/2, different Subscriptions will
   not be mapped to independent HTTP/2 streams.  When Restconf specifies
   this mapping, it should be integrated into this specification.

   Even without HTTP/2 multiplexing, it is possible that updates might
   be delivered in a different sequence than generated.  Reasons for
   this might include (but are not limited to):

   o  different durations needed to create various Subscription Updates,

   o  marshalling and bundling of multiple Subscription Updates for
      transport, and

   o  parallel HTTP1.1 sessions

   Therefore each Subscription Update will include a microsecond level
   timestamp to ensure that a receiver understands the time when a that
   update was generated.  Use of this timestamp can give an indication
   of the state of objects at a Publisher when state-entangled
   information is received across different subscriptions.  The use of
   the latest Subscription Update timestamp for a particular object
   update can introduce errors.  So when state-entangled updates have
   inconsistent object values and temporally close timestamps, a
   Receiver might consider performing a 'get' to validate the current
   state of objects.

3.9.  Push Data Stream and Transport Mapping

   Transported updates will contain data for one or more Subscription
   Updates.  Each transported Subscription Update notification contains
   several parameters:

   o  A global subscription ID correlator, referencing the name of the
      Subscription on whose behalf the notification is sent.

   o  Data nodes containing a representation of the datastore subtree
      containing the updates.  The set of data nodes must be filtered
      per access control rules to contain only data that the subscriber
      is authorized to see.

   o  An event time which contains the time stamp at publisher when the
      event is generated.

3.9.1.  Pushing Subscription Updates via Restconf

   Subscribers can dynamically learn whether a RESTCONF server supports
   yang-push.  This is done by issuing an HTTP request OPTIONS, HEAD, or
   GET on the stream push-update.  E.g.:

   GET /restconf/data/ietf-restconf-monitoring:restconf-state/
            streams/stream=yang-push HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/yang.data+xml

   If the server supports it, it may respond

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/yang.api+xml
   <stream xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-monitoring">

   Subscribers can determine the URL to receive updates by sending an
   HTTP GET request for the "location" leaf with the stream list entry.
   The stream to use for yang push is the push-update stream.  The
   location returned by the publisher can be used for the actual
   notification subscription.  Note that different encodings are
   supporting using different locations.  For example, he subscriber
   might send the following request:

   GET /restconf/data/ietf-restconf-monitoring:restconf-state/
            streams/stream=yang-push/access=xml/location HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/yang.data+xml

   The publisher might send the following response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/yang.api+xml
      <location
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-monitoring">
           https://example.com/streams/yang-push-xml
      </location>

   To subscribe and start receiving updates, the subscriber can then
   send an HTTP GET request for the URL returned by the publisher in the
   request above.  The accept header must be "text/event -stream".  The
   publisher handles the connection as an event stream, using the Server
   Sent Events[W3C-20121211] transport strategy.

   The publisher MUST support as query parameters for a GET method on
   this resource all the parameters of a subscription.  The only
   exception is the encoding, which is embedded in the URI.  An example
   of this is:

   // subtree filter = /foo
   // periodic updates, every 5 seconds
   GET /mystreams/yang-push?subscription-id=my-sub&period=5&
              xpath-filter=%2Fex:foo[starts-with("bar"."some"]

   Should the publisher not support the requested subscription, it may
   reply:

   To modify a subscription, the subscriber issues another GET request
   on the provided URI using the same subscription-id as in the original
   request.  For example, to modify the update period to 10 seconds, the
   subscriber may send:

   GET /mystreams/yang-push?subscription-id=my-sub&period=10&
          subtree-filter=%2Ffoo'

   To delete a subscription, the subscriber issues a DELETE request on
   the provided URI using the same subscription-id as in the original
   request

   DELETE /mystreams/yang-push?subscription-id=my-sub

5.  Security Considerations

   Subscriptions could be used to intentionally or accidentally overload
   resources of a Publisher.  For this reason, it is important that the
   Publisher has the ability to prioritize the establishment and push of
   updates where there might be resource exhaust potential.  In
   addition, a server needs to be able to suspend existing subscriptions
   when needed.  When this occurs, the subscription status must be
   updated accordingly and the clients are notified.

   A Subscription could be used to retrieve data in subtrees that a
   client has not authorized access to.  Therefore it is important that
   data pushed via a Subscription is authorized equivalently with
   regular data retrieval operations.  Data being pushed to a client
   needs therefore to be filtered accordingly, just like if the data
   were being retrieved on-demand.  The Netconf Authorization Control
   Model [RFC6536] applies.

   One or more Publishers could be used to overwhelm a Receiver which
   doesn't even support subscriptions.  Therefore Updates MUST only be
   transmittable over Encrypted transports.  Clients which do not want
   pushed data need only terminate or refuse any transport sessions from
   the Publisher.

   One or more Publishers could overwhelm a Receiver which is unable to
   control or handle the volume of Updates received.  In deployments
   where this might be a concern, transports supporting per-subscription
   Flow Control and Prioritization (such as HTTP/2) should be selected.

   Another benefit is that a well-behaved Publisher implementation is
   that it is difficult to a Publisher to perform a DoS attack on a
   Receiver.  DoS attack protection comes from:

   o  the requirement for trust of a TLS session before publication,

   o  the need for an HTTP transport augmentation on the Receiver, and

   o  that the Publication process is suspended when the Receiver
      doesn't respond.

Appendix A.  Dynamic YANG Subscription when the Subscriber and Receiver
             are different

   The methods of Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 can be combined to enable
   deployment models where the Subscriber and Receiver are different.
   Such separation can be useful with some combination of:

   o  An operator wants any Subscriptions immediately deleted should TLS
      connectivity be lost.  (I.e., Subscriptions don't default into a
      'Suspended' state on the Publisher.)

   o  An operator wants the Publisher to include highly restrictive
      capacity management and security mechanisms outside of domain of
      existing operational or programmatic interfaces.

   o  Restconf is not desired on the Receiver.

   o  The Publisher doesn't want to maintain Restconf subscriptions with
      many Receivers.

   To do this, first the necessary information must be signaled as part
   of the <create-subscription>.  This includes all the information
   described in section 3.3.2, with the exception of the security
   credentials.  (It is assumed that any security credentials required
   for establishing any transport connections are pre-provisioned on all
   devices.)

   Using this set of Subscriber provided information, the same process
   described within section 3.3.2 will be followed.  There is one
   exception.  When an HTTP status code is 201 is received by the
   Publisher, it will inform the Subscriber of Subscription
   establishment success via its Restconf connection.

   After successful establishment, if the Subscriber wishes to maintain
   the state of Receiver subscriptions, it can simply place a separate
   on-change Subscription into the "Subscriptions" subtree of the YANG
   Datastore on the Publisher.

   Putting it all together, the message flow is:

Appendix B.  End-to-End Deployment Guidance

   Several technologies are expected to be seen within a deployment to
   achieve security and ease-of-use requirements.  These are not
   necessary for an implementation of this specification, but will be
   useful to consider when considering the operational context.

B.1.  Call Home

   Pub/Sub implementations should have the ability to transparently
   incorporate lower layer technologies such as Call Home so that secure
   TLS connections are always originated from the Publisher.  There is a
   Restconf Call home function in [call-home].  For security reasons,
   this should be implemented as desired.

B.2.  TLS Heartbeat

   Unlike NETCONF, HTTP sessions might not quickly allow a Subscriber to
   recognize when the communication path has been lost from the
   Publisher.  To recognize this, it is possible for a Receiver (usually
   the subscriber) to establish a TLS heartbeat [RFC6520].  In the case
   where a TLS heartbeat is included, it should be sent just from
   Receiver to Publisher.  Loss of the heartbeat should result in the
   Subscription being terminated with the Subscriber (even when the

   Subscriber and Receiver are different).  The Subscriber can then
   attempt to re-establish the subscription if desired.  If the
   Subscription remains active on the Publisher, future receipt of
   objects associated with that (or any other unknown) subscription ID
   should result in a <delete-subscription> being returned to the
   Publisher from the Receiver.

B.3.  Putting it together

   If Subscriber and receiver are same entity then subscriber can direct
   send create_subscription message to publisher.  Once the subscription
   moved to accepted state, the receiver can use Server Sent Events
   [W3C-20121211] transport strategy to subscriber event notifications
   for the data as defined in[restconf].
