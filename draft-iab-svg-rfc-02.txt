1.  Introduction

   Over the last few years the RFC Editor has worked with the Internet
   community to develop specifications for changes in the format of
   RFCs.  An outline of the resulting specifications was published as
   [RFC6949] in May 2013.  Since then a Design Team has been working
   with the RFC Editor to flesh out those specifications.  One aspect of
   the changes is to allow line drawings in RFCs; [RFC6949] says

      "Graphics may include ASCII art and a more complex form to be
      defined, such as SVG line art [SVG].  Color and grayscale will not
      be accepted.  RFCs must correctly display in monochromatic black-
      and-white to allow for monochrome displays, black-and-white
      printing, and support for visual disabilities."

   SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has been developed by W3C, the World
   Wide Web Consortium; its current standard is SVG 1.1 Full
   [W3C.REC-SVG11-20110816].  This document defines SVG 1.2 RFC, an SVG
   profile (i.e. a subset of SVG) that is suitable for RFC line
   drawings.

   Note that in RFCs, the text provides normative descriptions of
   protocols, systems, etc.  Diagrams may be used to help explain
   concepts more clearly, but they provide supporting detail, and should
   not be considered to be complete specifications in themselves.

Internet-Draft     SVG Drawings for RFCs: SVG 1.2 RFC      February 2016


   The details (particularly any vocabularies) described in this
   document are expected to change based on experience gained in
   implementing the RFC production center's toolset.  Revised documents
   will be published capturing those changes as the toolset is
   completed.  Other implementors must not expect those changes to
   remain backwards-compatible with the details described in this
   document.

2.  SVG 1.2 RFC: An SVG profile for RFCs

   As a starting point for SVG 1.2 RFC, the Design Team decided to use
   SVG 1.2 Tiny [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222].  SVG 1.2 Tiny is an SVG
   subset intended to be implemented on small, mobile devices such as
   cellphones and smartphones.  That should allow RFCs to be rendered
   well on such devices, especially those that have small screens.
   However, RFCs are self-contained documents that do not change once
   they are published.  The use of SVG drawings in RFCs is intended to
   allow authors to create drawings that are simple to produce, and
   easier to understand than our traditional 'ASCII Art' ones.  In
   short, we are also trying to improve access to the content in RFCs,
   so SVG drawings need to be kept as simple as possible.

   Appendix A (below) provides a complete RELAX NG Compact (rnc) schema
   for SVG 1.2 RFC.  It is derived from the SVG 1.2 schema, and is the
   formal definition of SVG 1.2 RFC.  The remainder of this section
   gives a simplified - i.e. easier to read and dunderstand - overview
   of SVG 1.2 RFC.

   SVG can provide a complete User Interface, but within RFCs, all we
   need are simple diagrams that do not change once the RFC is
   published.  Therefore, SVG RFC does not allow anything from the
   following sections in SVG Tiny 1.2 [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222]:

   12  Multimedia
   13  Interactivity
   15  Scripting
   16  Animation
   18  Metadata
   19  Extensibility

   Note that SVG Tiny 1.2 elements may have many properties or
   attributes that are needed to support aspects of the above sections.
   Those are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.

   Considering the other sections in SVG Tiny 1.2
   [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222]:

    9 Basic Shapes

   10 Text
        Everything in these sections is allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.

   11 Painting: Filling, Stroking, Colors and Paint Servers
        Anything relating to 'color' is not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC,
        everything else is allowed.  This is a requirement documented in
        [RFC6949].

   14 Linking
        SVG Tiny 1.2 allows internationalized IRIs in references.  In
        SVG 1.2 RFC such links must be ASCII only.  That should not
        cause problems, since one can just use the URI form of any IRI.
        Authors should try to use links only to URIs that are long-term
        stable.


   17 Fonts
        SVG 1.2 RFC only allows 'serif', 'sans-serif' and 'monospace'
        generic font families from the WebFonts facility, described in
        CSS 2.1, [W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607], section 15, Fonts.  In
        particular, the SVG 'font' element is not allowed.

2.1.  Elements, properties and attributes allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC

   Elements, properties and attributes selected for SVG 1.2 RFC from
   [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222].

  In the list below, elements and properties are listed on the
  left,and their allowed values are given in parentheses on the
  right.

  <color> is the list of allowed colors, a black-and-white
          subset of the SVG color names.

  <style> is a set of CSS attributes that are commonly used (by SVG
          drawing applications).  They are not part of SVG Tiny 1.2,
          but are included here for compatibility.  Note that
          - There is no guarantee that any renderer will implement
            all the CSS attributes a drawing application may use.
          - Authors will need to consider the compatibility of their
            drawings with rendering devices.

  Elements:

    svg              (version=1.2, baseProfile=tiny, width, viewBox,
                      preserveAspectRatio, snapshotTime, height,

3.  How to create SVG drawings

   Many drawing packages can be used to create SVG drawings, for example
   Open Source packages Inkscape and Dia.  Be aware that such packages
   may use SVG elements or attributes that are not allowed in SVG 1.2
   RFC.

   o  For example, the 'marker' attribute is often used to place symbols
      such as arrowheads on lines, but 'marker' is not allowed in SVG

Internet-Draft     SVG Drawings for RFCs: SVG 1.2 RFC      February 2016


      1.2 Tiny or SVG 1.2 RFC.  In such cases one has to draw the
      arrowhead in another, simpler way.

   o  SVG clip paths are used to define a shape; objects outside that
      shape become invisible.  The 'clipPath' element is not allowed in
      SVG 1.2 Tiny or SVG 1.2 RFC.

   Diagrams produced with these packages may contain elements, their
   attributes or properties, or values of attributes or properties that
   are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.  We will need to provide a tool to
   strip out anything that is not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC, or to replace
   disallowed values, e.g., 'sans-serif' for 'Sans' as values for 'font-
   family'.  Experience with a simple test version of a tool for this
   has shown that such deletion and replacement can be effective for
   making SVG files from drawing packages conform to SVG 1.2 RFC,
   without visibly changing the diagrams they produce.

   The tool described above can also be used by Authors simply to check
   that their diagrams conform to SVG 1.2 RFC.  To help with this, if
   visible changes do occur, the tool should produce a list of non-
   allowed keywords and the context in which they were found.

   To include a diagram into an RFC, the xml2rfc (v3) tool will need to
   provide a way to include SVG drawings in Internet Drafts, as
   described in [XML2RFCv3] sections 2.5 and 2.67.

4.  Accessibility Considerations

   One of the long-term goals for RFCs is to make them more accessible,
   e.g. to sight-impaired readers.  For diagrams, it would be useful for
   authors to provide alternative forms of the diagram, so that voice-
   reading software could be used to 'talk through' the diagram.  Simply
   reading the SVG code for a complex diagram seems unlikely to work.

   SVG 1.2 RFC allows SVG's 'title' and 'desc' elements.  'title'
   provides a brief text caption for an SVG object (much like a figure
   caption), and 'desc' provides a longer text description of what the
   object actually represents.  As well, the SVG 'role' attribute can be
   used to indicate to a browser how an SVG object is to be interpreted.
   Good suggestions on how to use these elements are given in
   [SVG-ACCESS-TIPS].

   ARIA is a W3C Recommendation for using SVG to create 'Accessible Rich
   Internet Applications.'  A helpful introduction to ARIA is provided
   by [SVG-ARIA-PRIMER], while [SVG-USING-ARIA] gives examples of how to
   use ARIA to enhance SVG accessibility.

5.  Examples of diagrams common in RFCs

   Another way to create SVG drawings is to write programs to draw them.
   For example, using python and its svgwrite module is a pleasant
   environment (for those who like writing code); this section presents
   a few examples of diagrams created in this way.  Note that they are
   merely examples of typical diagrams from RFCs.

   The SVG diagrams for this section can be seen at
   [This-I-D-with-SVG-included] along with an html version of this draft
   that includes the SVG diagrams.

5.1.  Packet Layout Diagrams

   Example: Figure 3 from [RFC0793].

5.2.  Sequence Diagrams (1)

   Example: Figure 6 from [ExpTrustedProxy].

5.3.  Sequence Diagrams (2)

   Example: Figure 3 from [RFC4321].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
   values in existing registries; no IANA action is required.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the RSE and the Design Team members for their helpful
   comments and suggestions for SVG 1.2 RFC, as well as from the wider
   IETF community.

8.  Revision History [RFC Editor please delete]

   version -02, 25 Feb 16:
      Changed the example metalanguage by removing the metalanguage
      code.  The svg diagrams remain, as examples of diagrams that have
      appeared in earlier RFCs.

   version -01, 26 Jan 16:
      rnc schema changed to use Joe Hildebrand's version, github:
      "rename title element *reference* to svgTitle, in order to allow
      combination with XML2RFC schema.  Note: XML element name does not
      change."

Appendix A.  RELAX NG Compact (rnc) Schema for SVG 1.2 RFC

   The following rnc schema can be used to check whether an svg file
   conforms to SVG 1.2 RFC.  For example, if this schema were contained
   in a file called SVG-1.2-RFC.rnc, the following command will test
   whether svg file diagram.svg is a conformant SVG 1.2 RFC drawing.
