2. Abstract 
    
   Future optical networks will consist of optical crossconnects (OXCs) 
   that may be configured with links consisting of a number of user 
   bearer channels and an associated control channel.  This document 
   specifies a link management protocol (LMP) that runs between 
   neighboring OXCs and will be used for both link provisioning and 
   fault isolation.  A unique feature of LMP is that it is able to 
   isolate faults in both opaque and transparent networks, independent 
   of the encoding scheme used for the bearer channels. LMP will be 
   used to maintain control channel connectivity, verify bearer channel 
   connectivity, and isolate link, fiber, or channel failures within 
   the optical network.

3. Introduction 
    
   Future optical networks will consist of optical crossconnects (OXCs) 
   that use the MPLS control plane to dynamically provision optical 
   trails and to provide network survivability using protection and 
   restoration techniques.  A pair of OXCs may be connected by a number 
   of fibers, and each fiber may be used to transmit multiple 
   wavelengths if DWDM is used.  Furthermore, multiple fibers and/or 
   multiple wavelengths may be combined into a single logical link, 
   where we follow the convention of [2] and define a link as a logical 
   relationship associating a control channel with zero or more user 
   bearer channels. 
    
   This document specifies a link management protocol (LMP) that runs 
   between neighboring OXCs and will be used for both link provisioning 
   and fault isolation.  The intent of this document is to lay the 
   foundation for the protocol, and as this document progresses, the 
   messages referenced herein will be explicitly defined.  We do 
   propose, however, that the messages are IP encoded so that the link 
   level encoding becomes an implementation agreement and is not part 
   of LMP specifications. 
    
   In this document, we will follow the naming convention of [3] and 
   use OXC to refer to all categories of optical crossconnects, 
   irrespective of the internal switching fabric.  We distinguish 
   between crossconnects that have electronic cores, called digital 
   crossconnects (DXCs), and those that are all-optical, called 
   photonic crossconnects (PXCs) - referred to as pure crossconnects in 
   [3], because the transparent nature of PXCs introduces new 
   restrictions for monitoring and managing the data channels (see [4] 
   for proposed extensions to MPLS for performance monitoring in 
   photonic networks).  The LMP that we propose, however, can be used 
   for any type of OXC, enhancing the functionality of traditional DXCs 
   while enabling PXCs to intelligently interoperate in heterogeneous 
   optical networks. 
    
   Due to the transparent nature of PXCs, traditional methods can no 
   longer be used to monitor and manage links.  LMP has been designed 
   to address issues faced in managing links in a network with PXCs.  
   In addition, since LMP does not dictate the actual transport 
   mechanism, this protocol can be implemented on both PXCs and DXCs to 
   allow interoperability.  A requirement for LMP is that each link has 
   an associated bi-directional control channel and that free bearer 
   channels must be opaque (i.e., able to be terminated); however, once 
   a bearer channel is allocated, it may become transparent.  There is 
   no requirement that the control channel and bearer channels share 
   the same medium; however, the control channel must terminate on the 
   same two nodes that the bearer channels span.  LMP consists of four 
   types of functions: a Hello exchange is used to verify and maintain 
   control-channel and link connectivity between neighboring OXCs; link 
   verification is used to verify bearer channel connectivity and 
   exchange Label mappings; a LabelSummary exchange is used to 
   synchronize Label matching and correlate link properties; and a

   fault localization technique is used to isolate link and channel 
   failures and initiate protection and restoration techniques. 
    
   The organization of the remainder of this document is as follows.  
   In Section 4, we discuss the role of the control channel and the 
   Hello exchange in maintaining link connectivity.  The link 
   verification procedure is discussed in Section 5.  In Section 6, we 
   show how the LMP will be used to isolate link and channel failures 
   within the optical network. 
    
4. Control channel management 
    
   To establish a link between two OXCs, a control channel must first 
   be configured.  The control channel can be used to exchange MPLS 
   control-plane information such as link provisioning and fault 
   isolation information (implemented using a messaging protocol such 
   as LMP, proposed in this draft), path management and label 
   distribution information (implemented using a signaling protocol 
   such as RSVP-TE [5] or CR-LDP [6]), and topology and state 
   distribution information (implemented using traffic engineering 
   extended protocols such as OSPF [7] and IS-IS [8]).  We require a 
   control channel be associated with each link. We do not specify the 
   exact implementation of the control channel, but rather we assign a 
   (fiber, wavelength) pair to each control channel for identification 
   purposes.  This allows the control channel implementation to 
   encompass both in-band and out-of-band mechanisms including the case 
   where the control channel is transmitted separately from the 
   associated bearer channel(s) of a link, either on a separate 
   wavelength or a separate fiber. 
    
   The control channel of a link can be either explicitly configured or 
   automatically selected, however, for the purpose of this document we 
   will assume the control channel is explicitly configured.  A control 
   channel will be assigned a (fiber, wavelength) pair for 
   identification purposes.  Note that for in-band signaling, a bearer 
   channel could be allocated to the same (fiber, wavelength) pair as 
   the control channel; however, this is not true when the control 
   channel is transmitted separately from the bearer channels.  In 
   addition to a primary control channel, an ordered list of backup 
   control channels can also be specified. 
    
   For LMP, it is essential that a control channel is always available 
   for a link, and in the event of a control channel failure, an 
   alternate (or backup) control channel must be made available to 
   reestablish communication with the neighboring OXC.  If the control 
   channel cannot be established on the primary (fiber, wavelength) 
   pair, then a backup control channel should be tried.  Of course, 
   alternate control channels can (and should) be pre-configured, 
   however, coordinating the switchover of the control channel to an 
   alternate channel is still an important issue.  Specifically, if the 
   control channel fails but the node is still operational (i.e., the 
   bearer channels are still passing user data), then both the local 
   and remote nodes should switch to an alternate control channel.

4.1. Hello protocol 
    
   Once a control channel is configured between two OXCs, a Hello 
   protocol will be used to establish and maintain connectivity between 
   the OXCs and to detect link failures.  The Hello protocol of LMP is 
   intended to be a lightweight keep-alive mechanism that will react to 
   control channel failures rapidly so that IGP Hellos are not lost and 
   the associated link-state adjacencies are not removed.  Furthermore, 
   the RSVP Hello of [5] is not needed since the LMP Hellos will detect 
   link layer failures. 
    
   The Hello protocol will consist of a single unicast Hello message 
   that is periodically sent along the control channel to the adjacent 
   OXC.  Each Hello message will contain two sequence numbers: the 
   first will be the sequence number (SendSeqNum) for this Hello 
   message and the second will be the sequence number (RecSeqNum) of 
   the last Hello message received along the link from the adjacent 
   OXC.  The sequence number in the Hello message starts at 1 and 0 is 
   used to indicate a node reset.  When a node is brought up (either 
   through a regular boot or through a reboot), the value of SendSeqNum 
   will be reset to 0.  Having sequence numbers in the Hello messages 
   provide a two-fold service.  First, the remote OXC will detect that 
   a node has rebooted if the SendSeqNum is 0.  If this occurs, the 
   remote node will indicate its knowledge of the reboot by setting 
   RecSeqNum=0 in the Hello messages that it sends and will wait to 
   receive a Hello message with SendSeqNum=1 before proceeding with 
   bearer channel verification.  Second, by including the RecSeqNum in 
   Hello packets, the local node will know which Hello packets the 
   remote node has received. This is important because the local node 
   will behave differently to messages based on which Hello messages 
   the remote node is responding to.  For example, if the local node 
   has rebooted and receives a message with a RecSeqNum value that is 
   not equal to 0, the local node should discard the message and wait 
   until it receives a Hello message with RecSeqNum=0 indicating that 
   the remote node knows it has rebooted. 
    
5. Verifying link connectivity 
    
   In this section, we describe the mechanism used to verify the 
   physical connectivity of the bearer channels.  This will be done 
   initially when a link is established, and subsequently, on a 
   periodic basis for all free bearer channels on the link.  A unique 
   characteristic of all-optical PXCs is that the data being 
   transmitted over a bearer channel is not terminated at the PXC, but 
   instead passes through transparently.  This characteristic of PXCs 
   poses a challenge for validating the connectivity of the bearer 
   channels since shining unmodulated light through a bearer channel 
   may not result in received light at the next PXC.  This is because 
   there may be terminating (or opaque) elements, such as DWDM 
   equipment, in between the PXCs.  Therefore, to ensure proper 
   verification of bearer channel connectivity, we require that until 
   the bearer channels are allocated, they must be opaque.  
   Furthermore, we assume that the architecture of the OXC is designed 
   so that messages can be sent and received over any bearer channel.  
 
Lang/Mitra et al                                              [Page 4] 

Internet Draft        draft-lang-mpls-lmp-00.txt            March 2000 

   Note that this requirement is trivial for DXCs since each channel 
   (bearer or control) is received electronically before being 
   forwarded to the next DXC, but that in PXCs this is an additional 
   requirement. 
    
   To interconnect two OXCs, a link must be added between them, and at 
   a minimum, the link must contain a control channel spanning the two 
   OXCs.  Optionally, the attributes of a link may include the 
   protection mechanism for the control channel, a list of bearer 
   channels, and the protection mechanism for each bearer channel. 
    
   As part of the link verification protocol, the control channel is 
   first verified, and connectivity maintained, using the Hello 
   protocol discussed in Section 4.1.  Once the control channel has 
   been established between the two OXCs, bearer channel connectivity 
   is verified by exchanging Ping-type Test messages over all of the 
   bearer channels specified in the link.  It should be noted that all 
   messages except for the Test message are exchanged over the control 
   channel and that Hello messages continue to be exchanged over the 
   control channel during the bearer channel verification process.  The 
   Test message is sent over the bearer channel that is being verified.  
   Bearer channels are tested in the transmit direction as they are 
   uni-directional, and as such, it may be possible for both OXCs to 
   exchange the Test messages simultaneously. 
    
   To initiate the link verification process, the local OXC first sends 
   a BeginVerify message over the control channel to indicate that the 
   node will begin sending Test messages across the bearer channels of 
   a particular link.  The BeginVerify message contains the number of 
   bearer channels that are to be verified and, for each bearer 
   channel, the local RSVP Label object, represented as a (fiber, 
   lambda) pair as defined in [9].  When the remote OXC receives a 
   BeginVerify message and it is ready to receive Test messages, it 
   sends a BeginVerifyAck message back to the local OXC.  When the 
   local OXC receives a BeginVerifyAck message from the remote OXC, it 
   will begin transmitting periodic Test messages over the specified 
   bearer channels.  The Test message will include the Label object for 
   the associated channel.  The remote OXC will return a TestStatus 
   (Success or Failure) message in response for each bearer channel and 
   will expect a TestStatusAck message from the local node to confirm 
   receipt. 
    
   The local (transmitting) node will send a given Test message 
   periodically on the corresponding bearer channel until it receives a 
   correlating TestStatusSuccess or TestStatusFailure message on the 
   control channel from the remote (receiving) node.  The remote node 
   will send a given TestStatusSuccess or TestStatusFailure message 
   periodically on the control channel until it receives a correlating 
   TestStatusAck message on the control channel from the local node.  
   Message correlation is done using the local node's (fiber, lambda) 
   pair. 
    
   When the Test message is detected at the remote OXC, the Label is 
   recorded and mapped to the remote OXCÆs Label for that channel.  The 
 
Lang/Mitra et al                                              [Page 5] 

Internet Draft        draft-lang-mpls-lmp-00.txt            March 2000 

   remote OXC then sends a TestStatusSuccess message over the control 
   channel to the local OXC indicating that the Test message was 
   detected and the physical connectivity of the bearer channel has 
   been verified. The TestStatusSuccess message includes both the local 
   and remote OXCs Label objects for the bearer channel.  When the 
   TestStatusSuccess message is received, the local OXC marks the 
   channel as UP, sends a TestStatusAck message to the remote OXC, and 
   begins testing the next bearer channel.  If, however, the Test 
   message is not detected at the remote node within an observation 
   period (specified by a timeout value), the remote OXC will send a 
   TestStatusFailure message over the control channel indicating that 
   the verification of the physical connectivity of the bearer channel 
   has failed.  When the local OXC receives a TestStatusFailure 
   message, it will mark the channel as FAILED, send a TestStatusAck 
   message to the remote OXC, and begin testing the next bearer 
   channel.  When all the bearer channels on the list have been tested, 
   the local OXC will send an EndVerify message to indicate that 
   testing has been completed on this link.  An EndVerifyAck is sent as 
   a response. 
    
   Both the local and remote nodes will maintain the complete list of 
   Label mappings for correlation purposes, especially in the event of 
   a node reboot. 
    
   There is also a LabelSummary message that can be exchanged at any 
   time by the two OXCs.  This message contains all the Label 
   associations for a particular link.  In addition, each Label [i.e., 
   (fiber, lambda) pair] may have one or more associated protection 
   Labels defined for local (span) M:N protection.  If the LabelSummary 
   message received from a remote OXC is accepted and the Label objects 
   match the local Label associations, then the remote local protection 
   definitions are updated and a LabelSummaryAck message is 
   transmitted.  Otherwise a LabelSummaryNack message will be 
   transmitted, indicating which Label associations are not correct.  
   If a LabelSummaryNack message is received, the link verification 
   process should be repeated for all mismatched free bearer channels; 
   if an allocated bearer channel has a label mismatch, it should be 
   flagged and verified when it becomes free. 
 
5.1. Example of link verification 
    
   The figure below shows an example of the link verification scenario 
   executed when a link between OXC A and OXC B is added.  In this 
   example, the link will consist of a bi-directional control channel 
   (indicated by a "c") and three free bearer channels (each 
   transmitted along a separate fiber).  The verification process is as 
   follows:  OXC A sends a BeginVerify message to OXC B indicating it 
   will begin verifying the bearer channels of the link.  OXC B 
   receives the BeginVerify message and returns the BeginVerifyAck 
   message to OXC A.  When OXC A receives the BeginVerifyAck message, 
   it begins transmitting periodic Test messages with the Label object 
   (Fiber 1, 0xffff) across the fiber; the special value of 0xffff for 
   the lambda indicates the whole fiber [9].  When OXC B receives the 
   Test messages, it maps OXC AÆs (Fiber 1, 0xffff) to its own Label of

   (Fiber 10, 0xffff) and transmits a TestStatusSuccess message back to 
   OXC A along the control channel.  The TestStatusSuccess message will 
   include both the local and remote Label objects for the bearer 
   channel, i.e., (Fiber 1, 0xffff) (Fiber 10, 0xffff).  The process is 
   repeated until all of the bearer channels are verified.  At that 
   point, OXC A will send an EndVerify message to OXC B to indicate 
   that testing is complete and OXC B will respond with an EndVerifyAck 
   message.

6. Fault localization 
    
   In this section, we describe a mechanism to rapidly isolate link or 
   bearer channel failures in an optical network.  As before, we assume 
   that a bi-directional control channel is always available for inter-
   node communication and that the control channel spans a single hop 
   between two neighboring OXCs.  The case where a control channel is 
   no longer available between two nodes is beyond the scope of this 
   draft.  The mechanism used to rapidly isolate link and bearer 
   channel failures is designed to work for unidirectional optical 
   trails, and can be easily extended to work for bi-directional 
   trails; however, for the purposes of this document, we only discuss 
   the operation when the optical trails are uni-directional. 
    
   A link connecting two OXCs consists of a control channel and a 
   number of bearer channels.  If bearer channels fail between two 
   OXCs, a mechanism must be used to rapidly locate the failure so that 
   appropriate protection/restoration mechanisms can be initiated.  An 
   important implication of using PXCs is that traditional methods used 
   by DXCs to monitor the health of allocated bearer channels may no 
   longer be appropriate since PXCs are transparent to the data bit-
   rate and format.  Instead, fault detection is delegated to the 
   physical layer (i.e., loss of light or optical monitoring of the 
   data) instead of the layer 2 or layer 3. 
 
Lang/Mitra et al                                              [Page 7] 

Internet Draft        draft-lang-mpls-lmp-00.txt            March 2000 

    
6.1. Fault detection 
 
   As mentioned earlier, fault detection must be handled at the layer 
   closest to the failure; for optical networks, this is the physical 
   (optical) layer.  One measure of fault detection at the physical 
   layer is simply detecting loss of light (LOL).  Other techniques for 
   monitoring optical signals are still being developed and will not be 
   further considered in this document.  However, it should be clear 
   that the mechanism used to locate the failure is independent of the 
   mechanism used to detect the failure, but simply relies on the fact 
   that a failure is detected in the optical layer. 
    
6.2. Fault localization mechanism 
 
   If bearer channels fail between two PXCs, the power monitoring 
   system in all of the downstream nodes will detect LOL and indicate a 
   failure.  As part of the fault localization, a monitoring window can 
   be used in each node to determine if a single bearer channel has 
   failed or if multiple bearer channels have failed. 
    
   As part of the fault localization, a downstream node that detects 
   bearer channel failures across a link will send a Channel_Fail 
   message to its upstream neighbor (bundling together the notification 
   of all of the failed bearer channels) and the node will put the 
   ports associated with the failed bearer channels into the standby 
   state.  An upstream node that receives the Channel_Fail message will 
   correlate the failure to see if there is a failure on the 
   corresponding input and output ports for the optical trail(s).  If 
   there is also a failure on the input channel(s) of the upstream 
   node, the node will return a Channel_Fail_Ack message to the 
   downstream node (bundling together the notification of all the 
   channels), indicating that it too has detected a failure.  If, 
   however, the fault is CLEAR in the upstream node (i.e., there is no 
   LOL on the corresponding input channels), then the upstream node 
   will have localized the failure and will return a Channel_Fail_Nack 
   message to the downstream node, and initiate protection/restoration 
   procedures. 
    
   As part of the Channel_Fail_Nack message, a Notify object may be 
   included when M:N span protection is provided.  The Notify object 
   will be used to coordinate channel switchover and will include one 
   or more sub-objects depending on the number of channels that need to 
   be switched.  Each sub-object will include a Label pair where the 
   first Label corresponds to the failed bearer channel and the second 
   Label corresponds to the protection bearer channel to be switched 
   to.  The protection channels may be preconfigured (using the verify 
   link procedure of Section 5) or they may be dynamically selected by 
   the OXC on the transmit side.

6.3. Examples of fault localization 
 
   In Fig. 2, a sample network is shown where four OXCs are connected 
   in a linear array configuration.  The control channels are bi-
   directional and are labeled with a "c".  All optical trails are uni-
   directional going left to right. 
    
   In the first example [see Fig. 2(A)], there is a failure on a single 
   bearer channel between PXC2 and PXC3.  Both PXC3 and PXC4 will 
   detect the failure and each node will send a Channel_Fail message to 
   the corresponding upstream node (PXC3 will send a message to PXC2 
   and PXC4 will send a message to PXC3).  When PXC3 receives the 
   Channel_Fail message from PXC4, it will correlate the failure and 
   return a Channel_Fail_Ack message back to PXC4.  Upon receipt of the 
   Channel_Fail_Ack message, PXC4 will move the associated ports into a 
   standby state. When PXC2 receives the Channel_Fail message from 
   PXC3, it will correlate the failure, verify that it is CLEAR, 
   localize the failure to the bearer channel between PXC2 and PXC3, 
   and send a Channel_Fail_Nack message back to PXC3. 
    
   In the second example [see Fig. 2(B)], there is a failure on three 
   bearer channels between PXC3 and PXC4.  In this example, PXC4 has 
   correlated the failures and will send a bundled Channel_Fail message 
   for the three failures to PXC3.  PXC3 will correlate the failures, 
   localize them to the channels between PXC3 and PXC4, and return a 
   bundled Channel_Fail_Nack message back to PXC4. 
    
   In the last example [see Fig. 2(C)], there is a failure on the 
   tributary channel of the ingress node (PXC1) to the network.  Each 
   downstream node will detect the failure on the corresponding input 
   ports and send a Channel_Fail message to the upstream neighboring 
   node.  When PXC2 receives the message from PXC3, it will correlate 
   the Channel_Fail message and return a Channel_Fail_ACK message to 
   PXC3 (PXCs3 and 4 will also act accordingly).  Since PXC1 is the 
   ingress node to the optical network, it will correlate the failure 
   and localize the failure to the bearer channel between itself and 
   the network element outside the optical network.

      Figure 2:  We show three types of bearer channel failures 
                 (indicated by ## in the figure):  (A) a single bearer 
                 channel fails between two PXCs, (B) three bearer 
                 channels fail between two PXCs, and (C) a single 
                 bearer channel fails on the tributary input of PXC 1.  
                 The control channel connecting two PXCs is indicated 
                 with a "c".
