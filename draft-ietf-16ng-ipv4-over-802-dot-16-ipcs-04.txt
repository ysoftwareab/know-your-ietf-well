Abstract

   IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband
   access.  IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service specific
   convergence sublayers for transmitting upper layer protocols.  The
   packet CS (Packet Convergence Sublayer) is used for the transport of
   all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE 802.3
   (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.1Q (VLAN).  The IP-specific part of the
   Packet CS enables the transport of IPv4 packets directly over the

Internet-Draft        IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IP CS         October 2008


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802_16] is a connection oriented access technology
   for the last mile.  The IEEE 802.16 specification includes the PHY
   and MAC details.  The MAC includes various convergence sublayers (CS)
   for transmitting higher layer packets including IPV4 packets
   [RFC5154].

   The scope of this specification is limited to the operation of IPv4
   over the IP-specific part of the packet CS (referred to as "IPv4 CS"
   or simply "IP CS" in this document).

   This document specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting
   IPv4 [RFC0791] packets over the IP CS of IEEE 802.16.  This document
   also specifies the MTU and address assignment method for the IEEE
   802.16 based networks using IP CS.

   This document also discusses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and
   Multicast Address Mapping whose operation is similar to any other
   point-to-point link model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5154].


3.  Typical Network Architecture for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16

   The network architecture follows what is described in [RFC5154] and
   [RFC5121].  In a nutshell, each MS is attached to an Access Router
   (AR) through a Base Station (BS), a layer 2 entity.  The AR can be an
   integral part of the BS or the AR could be an entity beyond the BS
   within the access network.  IPv4 packets between the MS and BS are
   carried over a point-to-point MAC transport connection which has a
   unique connection identifier (CID).  The packets between BS and AR
   are carried using L2 tunnel (typically GRE tunnel) so that MS and AR
   are seen as layer 3 peer entities.  At least one L2 tunnel is
   required for each MS, so that IP packets can be sent to MSs before
   they acquire IP addresses.  From the layer 3 perspective, MS and AR
   are connected by a point-to-point link.  The figure below illustrates
   the network architecture for convenience.

     Figure 1: Typical Network  Architecture for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16

   The above network model serves as an example and is shown to
   illustrate the point to point link between the MS and the AR.  The L2
   tunnel is not required if BS and AR are integrated into a single box.

3.1.  IEEE 802.16 IPv4 Convergence sub-layer support

   As described in [RFC5154] section 3.3., an IP specific subpart
   classifier carries either IPv4 or IPv6 payloads.  In this document,
   we are focussing on IPv4 over IP Convergence sublayer.

   The convergence sublayer maintains an ordered "classifier table".
   Each entry in the classifier table includes a classifier and a target
   CID.  In case of IP convergence sub-layer, the base-station performs
   the mapping between CID or service-flow ID and a corresponding GRE
   key for a particular IP-CS session.  Also the classification takes
   place in Access Router based on the GRE key per service-flow and/or
   IP-address of the MS.

   The other classifiers in Packet CS are IPv6 CS and Ethernet CS
   [RFC5154].  The classifiers used by IP CS, enable the differentiation
   of IPv4 and IPv6 packets and their mapping to specific transport
   connections over the air interface.

   The figure below shows the IPv4 user payload over IP transport over
   the packet CS of IEEE 802.16:

4.  IPv4-CS link in 802.16 Networks

   In this document we have defined IPv4 CS link as a point-to-point
   link between the MS and the AR using a set of service flows
   consisting of MAC transport connections between a MS and BS, and L2
   tunnel(s) between between a BS and AR.  It is recommended that a
   tunnel be established between the AR and a BS based on 'per MS' or
   'per service flow' (An MS can have multiple service flows each of
   which are identified by a unique service flow ID).  Then the
   tunnel(s) for an MS, in combination with the MS's MAC transport
   connections, forms a single point-to-point link.  Each MS belongs to
   a different link and is assigned an unique IPv4 address per
   recommendations in [RFC4968].  In summary:

   o  IPv4-CS uses the IPv4 header fields to classify the packets and
      map to appropriate CID.
   o  Point-to-point link between MS and AR is established.

4.1.  IPv4-CS link establishment

   In order to enable the sending and receiving of IPv4 packets between
   the MS and the AR, the link between the MS and the AR via the BS
   needs to be established.  This section explains the link
   establishment procedures following section 6.2 of [RFC5121].  Steps
   1-4 are same as indicated in 6.2 of [RFC5121].  In step 5, support
   for IPv4 is indicated.  In step 6, an initial service flow is created

   that can be used for exchanging IP layer signaling messages, e.g.
   address assignment procedures using DHCP.

   The address assignment procedure depends on the MS mode - i,e.
   whether it is acting as a Mobile IPv4 client or a Proxy Mobile IP
   client or a Simple IP client.  In the most common case, the MS
   requests an IP address using DHCP.

4.2.  Frame Format for IPv4 Packets

   IPv4 packets are transmitted in Generic IEEE 802.16 MAC frames in the
   data payloads of the 802.16 PDU ( see section 3.2 of [RFC5154] ).

4.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

      The MTU value for IPv4 packets on an IEEE 802.16 link is
   configurable.  The default MTU for IPv4 packets over an IEEE 802.16
      link SHOULD be 1500 bytes.    In some deployments, BS and AR are
   separate entities; an encapsulation may be used    to transport IPv4
   packets between the BS and AR.  In those cases the overhead    of
   encapsulation may be considered in the link MTU configuration.

   Note, if a deployment configures the 802.16 link MTU less than 1500,
   then 1500 byte packets from the MS will be dropped at the link-layer
   silently; the legacy IPv4 client implementations do not determine the
   link MTU by    default before sending packets, while the DHCP servers
   are required    to provide the MTU information only when requested.
   Please see    Appendix C.  for the default MTU value in WiMAX [WMF]
   deployed networks.

   This document recommends that a deployment should ensure that no
   packet loss    happens at the L2 level over  IPV4 CS link-MTU, due to
   mismatch in default MTU    and the configured link MTUs.

      However, it is strongly recommended that an IPv4 CS client host
   configure    the link-MTU before initiating the IP-level packet
   exchange.    The following paragraph discusses different approaches
   through which    the IPv4 CS client finds out the available link-MTU
   value.  The discovery    and configuration of a proper link MTU value
   ensures adequate usage of    the network bandwidth and resource.

   o  The IEEE is currently revising 802.16 (see 802.16Rev2 [802_16REV2]
      ) to reproduce capabilities to inform the Service Data Unit or MAC
      MTU in the IEEE 802.16 SBC-REQ/SBC-RSP phase, such that future
      IEEE 802.16 compliant clients can configure the negotiated MTU
      size for IP-CS link.  However, the implementation must communicate
      the negotiated MTU value to the IP layer to adjust the IP Maximum
      payload size for proper handling of fragmentation.  Note that this
      method is useful only when MS is directly connected to the BS.

   o  Configuration and negotiation of MTU size at the network-layer by
      using DHCP interface MTU option [RFC2132].

   This document recommends that all future implementations of IPv4 and
   IPv4-CS clients SHOULD implement DHCP interface MTU option [RFC2132]
   in order to configure its interface MTU according to the access
   network in order to maximize the capacity of the bandwidth of the
   network.  Thus the IPv4 stack should have capability to adjust the
   MTU value based on the DHCP response.

   In the absence of DHCP MTU configuration, the client node (MS) has
   two alternatives: 1) use the default MTU (1500 bytes) or 2) determine
   the MTU by the methods described in [802_16REV2].

   Additionally, the clients are encouraged to run PMTU[RFC 1191] or
   PPMTUD[RFC 4821].  However, PMTU mechanism has inherent problems of
   packet loss due to ICMP messages not reaching the sender and IPv4
   routers not fragmenting the packets due to DF bit being set in the IP
   packet.  The above mentioned path MTU mechanisms will take care of
   the MTU size between the MS and its correspondent node across
   different flavors of convergence layers in the WiMAX networks and
   other types of IP networks.


5.  Subnet Model and IPv4 Address Assignment

   The Subnet Model recommended for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16 using IP CS is
   based on the point-to-point link between MS and AR [RFC4968], hence
   each MS shall be assigned an address with 32bit prefix-length or
   subnet-mask.  The point-to-point link between MS and AR is achieved
   using a set of IEEE 802.16 MAC connections (identified by CIDs) and a
   L2 tunnel (usually a GRE tunnel) per MS between BS and AR.  If the AR
   is co-located with the BS then the set of IEEE 802.16 MAC connections
   between the MS and BS/AR represent the point-to- point connection.

5.1.  IPv4 Unicast Address Assignment and Router Discovery

   DHCP [RFC2131] SHOULD be used for assigning IPv4 address for the MS.
   DHCP messages are transported over IEEE 802.16 MAC connection to and
   from the BS and relayed to the AR.  In case DHCP server does not
   reside in the AR, the AR SHOULD implement DHCP relay Agent [RFC1542].
   Please refer to the MTU section of this document for requirements of
   DHCP interface-MTU option for the new IPv4 CS MS implementation.

   Although DHCP is the recommended method of address assignment, it is
   possible that the MS could be a pure Mobile-IPv4 [RFC3344] device or
   Wimax Mobile-IPv4 client which will be offered an IP-address from its
   home-network after success-ful Mobile-IP [RFC3344] registration.  In

Internet-Draft        IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IP CS         October 2008


   such situation, the mobile-client implementation SHOULD use the
   default link MTU in order to avoid any link-layer packet loss due to
   larger than supported packet size in the IP CS link.

   Router discovery messages [RFC1256] contain router solicitation and
   router advertisements.  The Router solicitation messages (multicast
   or broadcast) are directly delivered to AR via BS from the MS through
   the point-to-point link.  The BS SHOULD map the all-router multicast
   nodes or broadcast nodes for router discovery to the AR's IP-address
   and delivered directly to the AR.  Similarly for router-advertisement
   to the all-node multicast nodes will be either unicasted to each MS
   by the BS separately or put onto a multicast connection to which all
   MSs are listening to.  If no multicast connection exists, and the BS
   does not have the capability to aggregate and de-aggregate the
   messages from and to the MS hosts, then the AR implementation must
   take care of sending unicast messages to the corresponding individual
   MS hosts within the set of broadcast or multicast recipients.
   However, this specification simply assumes that the multicast service
   is provided.  How the multicast service is implemented in IEEE 802.16
   Packet CS network, is out of scope of this document.

   The 'Next-hop' IP-address of the IP CS MS is always the IP-address of
   the AR, because MS and AR are attached with a point-to-point link.

5.2.  Address Resolution Protocol

   The IP CS does not allow for transmission of ARP [RFC0826] packets.
   Furthermore, in a point-to-point link model, address resolution is
   not needed.

5.3.  IP Multicast Address Mapping

   IPv4 multicast packets are carried over the point-to-point link
   between the AR and the MS (via the BS).  The IPv4 multicast packets
   are classified normally at the IP CS if the IEEE 802.16 MAC
   connection has been setup with a multicast IP address as a
   classification parameter for the destination IP address.  The IPv4
   multicast address may be mapped into multicast CID defined in IEEE
   802.16 specification, but the mapping mechanism at the BS or
   efficiency of using multicast CID as opposed to simulating multicast
   by generating multiple unicast messages are out of scope of this
   document.  However, it has been studied that the use of multicast CID
   for realizing multicast transmissions reduces transmission efficiency
   when the multicast group is small, due to the nature of wireless
   network(IEEE 802.16) [ETHCS].

6.  Handling Multicast and Broadcast packets in IPv4 CS

   In the IP-CS link model, two different approaches can work - 1) BS
   maps the multicast or Broadcast IP-addresses into different multicast
   CIDs of the MSs or 2) AR maps the multicast IP-addresses to different
   unicast IP-addresses and send the packets directly to each MS
   separately.

   However as mentioned earlier, handling a mechanism of multicast or
   broadcast IP CS packets are out of scope of this document.  Please
   refer to Appendix section for some thoughts and suggestions.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies transmission of IPv4 packets over IEEE 802.16
   networks with IPv4 Convergence Sublayer and does not introduce any
   new vulnerabilities to IPv4 specifications or operation.  The
   security of the IEEE 802.16 air interface is the subject of
   [IEEE802_16].  In addition, the security issues of the network
   architecture spanning beyond the IEEE 802.16 base stations is the
   subject of the documents defining such architectures, such as WiMAX
   Network Architecture [WMF].


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Multiple Convergence Layers - Impact on Subnet Model

   Two different MSs using two different convergence sublayers (e.g. an
   MS using Ethernet CS only and another MS using IP CS only) cannot
   communicate at data link layer and requires interworking at IP layer.
   For this reason, these two nodes must be configured to be on two
   different subnets.  For more information refer [RFC4840].


Appendix B.  Sending and Receiving IPv4 Packets

   IEEE 802.16 MAC is a point-to-multipoint connection oriented air-
   interface, and the process of sending and receiving of IPv4 packets
   is different from multicast capable shared medium technologies like
   Ethernet.

   Before any packets being transmitted, IEEE 802.16 transport
   connection must be established.  This connection consists of IEEE
   802.16 MAC transport connection between MS and BS and an L2 tunnel
   between BS and AR.  This IEEE 802.16 transport connection provides a
   point-to-point link between MS and AR.  All the packets originated at
   the MS always reach AR before being transmitted to the final
   destination.

   IPv4 packets are carried directly in the payload of IEEE 802.16
   frames when the IPv4 CS is used.  IPv4 CS classifies the packet based
   on upper layer (IP and transport layers)header fields to put the
   packet on one of the available connections identified by the CID.
   The classifiers for the IPv4 CS are source and destination IPv4
   addresses, source and destinations ports, Type-of-Service and IP

   protocol field.  The CS may employ Packet Header Suppression (PHS)
   after the classification.

   The BS tunnels the packet that has been received on a particular MAC
   connection to the AR.  BS reconstructs the payload header if the PHS
   is in use before the packet is tunneled to the AR.  Similarly the
   packets received on a tunnel interface from the AR, would be mapped
   to a particular CID using IPv4 classification mechanism.

   AR performs normal routing for the packets that it receives and
   forwards the packet based on its forwarding table.  However the DHCP
   relay agent in the AR, MUST maintain the tunnel interface on which it
   receives DHCP requests, so that it can relay the DHCP responses to
   the correct MS.  One way of doing this is to have a mapping between
   MAC address and Tunnel Identifier.


Appendix C.  Wimax IPCS MTU size

      WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) forum has
   defined a    network architecture[WMF] where IPV4 CS is supported for
   transmission of    IPV4 packets between MS and BS over the IEEE
   802.16 link.    The addressing and operation of IPV4CS described in
   this    document are applicable to the WiMAX networks as well.  The
   WiMAX    forum [WMF] has specified the Max SDU size as 1522 octets.
   However,    it specifies that IP-payload in WiMAX architecture[WMF]
   is 1400 bytes.

      Hence if a IPV4-CS MS is configured with 1500 bytes it will have
   to be    communicated by the access router(AR) about the default link
   MTU    (1400 bytes) in WiMAX network.  However, currently in IPv4
   client    architecture a node is not required to ask for MTU option
   in its DHCP    messages nor an IPv4 router-advertisement can inform
   the node about    the link MTU.  An IPV4CS client is not capable of
   doing ARP probing either    to find out the link MTU.  Thus current
   specifications of WiMAX    network access routers cannot communicate
   its link MTU to the IPV4CS    MS.  On the other hand, it is
   imperative for an MS to know the link    MTU size if it is not the
   default MTU value for de-facto standard in    order to successfully
   send packets in the network towards the first    hop.  Some
   implementations with IEEE 802.16 layer 2 support, should    be able
   to sense IPV4CS WiMAX network and adjust their MTU size
   accordingly, however this document does not make any assumptions on
      this requirement.

   Thus, WiMAX MS nodes should use this default (1400) MTU value per the
   current specification [WMF].  However, due to reasons specified in
   section 4.3 above, it is strongly recommended that future WiMAX MS

   nodes support a default MTU of 1500 bytes, and that they implement
   MTU negotiation capabilities as mentioned in this document.


Appendix D.  Thoughts on handling multicast-broadcast IP packets

   Although this document does not directly specify details of multicast
   or broadcast packet handling, here are some suggestions:

   While uplink connections from the MSs to the BS provide only unicast
   transmission capabilities, downlink connections can be used for
   multicast transmission to a group of MSs as well as unicast
   transmission from the BS to a single MS.  For all-node IP-addresses,
   the AR or BS should have special mapping and the packets should be
   distributed to all active point-to-point connections by the AR or by
   the BS.  All-router multicast packets and any broadcast packets from
   a MS will be forwarded to the AR by the BS.  If BS and MS are co-
   located, then the first approach is more useful.  If the AR and BS
   are located separately then the second approach SHOULD be
   implemented.  An initial capability exchange message should be
   performed between BS and AR (if they are not co-located) to determine
   who would perform the distribution of multicast/broadcast packets.
   Such mechansim should be part of L2 exchange during the connection
   setup and is out of scope of this document.  In order to save energy
   of the wireless end-devices in the IEEE 802.16 wireless network, it
   is recommened that the multicast and broadcast from network side to
   device side should be reduced.  Only DHCP, IGMP, Router-advertisemnet
   packets are allowed on the downlink for multicast and broadcast IP-
   addresses.  Other protocols using multicast and broadcast IP-
   addresses should be permitted through local AR/BS configuration.
