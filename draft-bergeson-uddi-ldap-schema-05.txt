1. Introduction 
    
   This document defines "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol" 
   [LDAPv3] schema elements to represent the core data structures 
   identified in "Universal Description Discovery and Integration" 
   version 3 [UDDIv3] information model. This includes: a 
   businessEntity, a businessService, a bindingTemplate, a tModel, a 
   publisherAssertion and a Subscription.  Portions of [UDDIv3] are 
   repeated here for clarity. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
   All schema definitions are provided using [RFC2252] descriptions, 
   line-wrapped for readability only. 
    
    
3. Representation of UDDI Data Structures 
    
   The information that makes up a registration in a UDDI registry 
   consists of these data structure types.  This division by 
   information type provides simple partitions to assist in the rapid 
   location and understanding of the different information that makes 
   up a registration.

   The individual instance data managed by a UDDI registry are 
   sensitive to the parent/child relationships found in the schema.  A 
   businessEntity object contains one or more unique businessService 
   objects.  Similarly, individual businessService objects contain 
   specific instances of bindingTemplate, which in turn contains 
   information that includes pointers to specific instances of tModel 
   objects. 
    
   It is important to note that no single instance of a core schema 
   type is ever "contained" by more than one parent instance.  This 
   means that only one specific businessEntity object (identified by 
   its unique key value) will ever contain or be used to express 
   information about a specific instance of a businessService object 
   (also identified by its own unique key value). 
    
3.1 businessEntity 
    
   The businessEntity object represents all known information about a 
   business or entity that publishes descriptive information about the 
   entity as well as the services that it offers.  The businessEntity 
   is the top-level container that accommodates holding descriptive 
   information about a business or entity.  Service descriptions and 
   technical information are expressed within a businessEntity by a 
   containment relationship. 
    
3.1.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A businessEntity is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiBusinessKey, uddiAuthorizedName, uddiOperator, 
   uddiDiscoveryURLs, uddiName, uddiDescription, uddiIdentifierBag, 
   uddiCategoryBag, and uddiv3DigitalSignature, along with 
   corresponding v3 keys viz. uddiv3BusinessKey, as defined in section 
   5.  A businessEntity may contain zero or more instances of 
   uddiContact and uddiBusinessService.   
    
   The mandatory attribute, uddiBusinessKey, contains the unique 
   identifier for a given instance of a businessEntity. 
    
   businessEntity's definition is given in Section 6.  
    
3.2 businessService 
    
   The businessService instances represent a logical business service.  
   Each businessService object is the logical child of a single 
   businessEntity object.  Each businessService element contains 
   descriptive information in business terms outlining the type of 
   technical services found within each businessService instance. 
    
   In some cases, businesses would like to share or reuse services, 
   e.g. when a large enterprise publishes separate businessEntity

   structures.  This can be established by using the businessService 
   instance as a projection to an already published businessService. 
    
3.2.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A businessService is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiBusinessKey, uddiServiceKey, uddiName, uddiDescription, 
   uddiCategoryBag, uddiIsProjection, and uddiv3DigitalSignature, along 
   with corresponding v3 keys viz. uddiv3BusinessKey & 
   uddiv3ServiceKey, as defined in section 5. A businessService may 
   contain zero or more instances of uddiBindingTemplate.  The 
   mandatory attribute, uddiServiceKey, contains the unique identifier 
   for a given instance of a businessService. 
    
   businessService's definition is given in Section 6. 
    
3.3 bindingTemplate 
    
   Technical descriptions of Web services are accommodated via 
   individual contained instances of bindingTemplate objects.  These 
   instances provide support for determining a technical entry point or 
   optionally support remotely hosted services, as well as a 
   lightweight facility for describing unique technical characteristics 
   of a given implementation.  Support for technology and application 
   specific parameters and settings files are also supported. 
    
   Since UDDI's main purpose is to enable description and discovery of 
   Web Service information, it is the bindingTemplate that provides the 
   most interesting technical data. With UDDIv3, bindingTemplates also 
   can have categorization information. 
    
   Each bindingTemplate instance has a single logical businessService 
   parent, which in turn has a single logical businessEntity parent. 
    
3.3.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A bindingTemplate is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiBindingKey, uddiServiceKey, uddiDescription, uddiAccessPoint, 
   uddiHostingRedirector, uddiCategoryBag and uddiv3DigitalSignature, 
   along with corresponding v3 keys viz. uddiv3ServiceKey and 
   uddiv3BindingKey, as defined in section 5.  A bindingTemplate may 
   contain zero or more instances of uddiTModelInstanceDetails.  The 
   mandatory attribute, uddiBindingKey, contains the unique identifier 
   for a given instance of a bindingTemplate. 
    
   BindingTemplate's definition is given in Section 6. 
    
3.4 tModel 
    

  
Bergeson,Boogert & Nanjundaswamy      Internet-Draft                 4 











                         LDAP Schema for UDDI             January 2005 
 
 
   The tModel object takes the form of keyed metadata (data about 
   data).  In a general sense, the purpose of a tModel within the UDDI 
   registry is to provide a reference system based on abstraction.  
   Thus, the kind of data that a tModel represents is pretty nebulous.  
   In other words, a tModel registration can define just about 
   anything, but in the current revision, two conventions have been 
   applied for using tModels: as sources for determining compatibility 
   and as keyed namespace references. 
    
   The information that makes up a tModel is quite simple.  There's a 
   key, a name, an optional description, and a Uniform Resource Locator 
   [URL] that points somewhere--presumably somewhere where the curious 
   can go to find out more about the actual concept represented by the 
   metadata in the tModel itself. 
    
3.4.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A tModel is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiTModelKey, uddiAuthorizedName, uddiOperator, uddiName, 
   uddiDescription, uddiOverviewDescription, uddiOverviewURL, 
   uddiIdentifierBag, uddiCategoryBag, uddiIsHidden, and 
   uddiv3DigitalSignature, along with corresponding v3 key viz. 
   uddiv3tModelKey, as defined in section 5. A tModel may also contain 
   a uddiHidden to logically delete a tModel.  The mandatory attribute, 
   uddiTModelKey, contains the unique identifier for a given instance 
   of a tModel. 
    
   tModel's definition is given in Section 6. 
    
3.5 publisherAssertion 
    
   Many businesses, like large enterprises or marketplaces, are not 
   effectively represented by a single businessEntity, since their 
   description and discovery are likely to be diverse.  As a 
   consequence, several businessEntity instances can be published, 
   representing individual subsidiaries of a large enterprise or 
   individual participants of a marketplace.  Nevertheless, they still 
   represent a more or less coupled community and would like to make 
   some of their relationships visible in their UDDI registrations.  
    
3.5.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A publisherAssertion is represented in the directory by the 
   attributes uddiFromKey, uddiToKey, uddiKeyedReference, and uddiUUID, 
   and uddiv3DigitalSignature, as defined in section 5.  The mandatory 
   attribute, uddiUUID, contains the unique identifier for a given 
   instance of a publisherAssertion. 
    
   publisherAssertion's definition is given in Section 6.

3.6 Operational Information: 
 
   With UDDIv3, the operational information associated with the core 
   UDDI data structures is maintained in a separate OperationalInfo 
   structure, so that the digital signature specified by the publisher 
   remains valid.  
    
   The operationalInfo structure is used to convey the operational 
   information for the UDDIv3 core data structures, that is, the 
   businessEntity, businessService, bindingTemplate and tModel 
   structures. UDDIv3 OperationalInfo consists of 5 elements: created. 
   Modified, modifiedIncludingChildren, nodeId and authorizedName. 
    
   Depending on the specific UDDIv3 core data structure, the 
   operationalInformation is represented in the directory as a 
   combination of  implicit LDAP Standard Operational attributes: 
   createTimestamp and modifyTimestamp, and the following explicit 
   attributes: uddiAuthorizedName, uddiv3EntityCreationTime, 
   uddiv3EntityModificationTime and uddiv3NodeId. 
    
    
4. Attribute Type Definitions 
    
   Note that OIDs for the attribute types in this document have not 
   been assigned.  All OIDs are in brackets, <OID-TBD>, as a 
   placeholder until real OIDs are assigned. 
    
4.1 uddiBusinessKey 
    
   Used in uddiBusinessEntity and uddiBusinessService.   
    
   The uddiBusinessKey is the unique identifier for a given instance of 
   an uddiBusinessEntity. The attribute is optional for businessService 
   instances contained within a fully expressed parent that already 
   contains a businessKey value. 
    
   If the businessService instance is rendered into Extensible Markup 
   Language [XML] and has no containing parent that has within its data 
   a businessKey, the value of the businessKey that is the parent of 
   the businessService is required to be provided.  This behavior 
   supports the ability to browse through the parent-child 
   relationships given any of the core elements as a starting point. 
   The businessKey may differ from the publishing businessEntity's 
   businessKey to allow service projections.

   ) 
    
4.2 uddiAuthorizedName 
    
   The uddiAuthorizedName is the recorded name of the individual that 
   published the uddiBusinessEntity or uddiTModel data.  This data is 
   generated by the controlling operator and should not be supplied 
   within save_business operations.  
    
   With UDDIv3, this attribute is part of the ÊoperationalInformation∆ 
   meta-data associated with core data structures.

     SINGLE-VALUE 
   ) 
    
4.3 uddiOperator 
    
   The uddiOperator is the certified name of the UDDI registry site 
   operator that manages the master copy of the uddiBusinessEntity or 
   uddiTModel. The controlling operator records this data at the time 
   data is saved. This data is generated and should not be supplied 
   within save_business or save_tModel operations. 
    
   With UDDIv3, this field is no longer used - it is replaced by the 
   nodeId (uddiv3NodeId) attribute that is part of the 
   ÊoperationalInformation∆ meta-data.

4.4 uddiName 
    
   Used in uddiBusinessEntity, uddiBusinessService and uddiTModel. 
    
   These are the human readable names recorded for the 
   uddiBusinessEntity, uddiBusinessService, or uddiTModel, adorned with 
   a unique xml:lang value to signify the language that they are 
   expressed in. Name search is provided via find_business, 
   find_service, or find_tModel calls. 
    
   The publishing of several names, e.g. for romanization purposes, is 
   supported. In order to signify the language that the names are

   expressed in, they carry unique xml:lang values. Not more than one 
   name element may omit specifying its language. Names passed in this 
   way will be assigned the default language code of the registering 
   party. This default language code is established at the time that 
   publishing credentials are established with an individual Operator 
   Site. If no default language is provisioned at the time a publisher 
   signs up, the operator can adopt an appropriate default language 
   code. 
    
   With UDDIv3, multiple values with the same language code are 
   permitted.

   The xml:lang value precedes the name value with the "#" character 
   used as the separator. 
    
4.5 uddiDescription 
    
   The uddiDescription is an optional repeating element of one or more 
   descriptions. One description is allowed per national language code 
   supplied. With UDDIv3, there is no restriction on the number of 
   descriptions or on what xml:lang value that they may have.

   The xml:lang value precedes the name value with the "#" character 
   used as the separator. 
    
4.6 uddiDiscoveryURLs 
    
   This is a list of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that point to 
   alternate, file based service discovery mechanisms. Each recorded 
   uddiBusinessEntity structure is automatically assigned a URL that 
   returns the individual uddiBusinessEntity structure. URL search is 
   provided via find_business call. 
    
   The uddiDiscoveryURLs attribute is used to hold pointers to URL 
   addressable discovery documents. The expected retrieval mechanism 
   for URLs referenced in the data within this structure is via

   Hypertext Transfer Protocol [HTTP] HTTP-GET operation. The expected 
   return document is not defined. Rather, a framework for establishing 
   convention is provided, and two such conventions are defined within 
   UDDI behaviors. It is hoped that other conventions come about and 
   use this structure to accommodate alternate means of discovery. 
   With UDDIv3, a new convention is defined with useType as "homepage". 
   Further, a UDDIv3 server need not generate/add a discoveryURL 
   itself, since this can invalidate the digital signature of signed 
   Business Entity saved by publishers.

   ) 
    
   The useType value precedes the URL value with the "#" character used 
   as the separator. 
    
4.7 uddiUseType 
    
   The uddiUseType is used to describe the type of contact or address 
   in freeform text. Suggested examples for contact include "technical 
   questions", "technical contact", "establish account", "sales 
   contact", etc.  Suggested examples for address include 
   "headquarters", "sales office", "billing department", etc.

4.8 uddiPersonName 
    
   The uddiPersonName should list the name of the person or name of the 
   job role that will be available behind the contact. Examples of 
   roles include "administrator" or "webmaster".  
    
   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.4.8 NAME 'uddiPersonName'

     SINGLE-VALUE 
   ) 
    
   With UDDIv3, uddiPersonName becomes multi-valued and each name can 
   have an xml:lang attribute. The xml:lang value precedes the name 
   value with the "#" character used as the separator.

4.9 uddiPhone 
    
   Used to hold telephone numbers for the contact. This element can be 
   adorned with an optional uddiUseType attribute for descriptive 
   purposes. If more than one phone element is saved, uddiUseType 
   attributes are required on each.

   With UDDIv3, the sortCode attribute is deprecated because of the 
   guarantee of preserving the document Order. 
 
4.12 uddiTModelKey 
    
   The uddiTModelKey is the unique identifier for a given instance of 
   an uddiTModel. 
    
   It is also used in a KeyedReference and in Address structures. When 
   used with a keyed reference, this is the unique key to identify a 
   value-set and implies that the keyName keyValue pair in an 
   uddiIdentifier or uddiCategory Bag,are to be interpreted by the 
   value set referenced by the tModelKey.  
    
   When used with Addressline elements, implies that the keyName 
   keyValue pair given by subsequent uddiAddressLine elements are to be 
   interpreted by the address structure associated with the tModel that 
   is referenced.

4.13 uddiAddressLine 
    
   The uddiAddressLine contains the actual address in freeform text. If 
   the address element contains a uddiTModelKey, these uddiAddressLine 
   elements are to be adorned each with an optional keyName keyValue 
   attribute pair. Together with the uddiTModelKey, keyName and 
   keyValue qualify the uddiAddressLine in order to describe its 
   meaning. 
    
   The uddiAddressLine elements contain string data with a line length 
   limit of 80 character positions. Each uddiAddressLine element can be 
   adorned with two optional descriptive attributes, keyName and 
   keyValue. Both attributes must be present in each address line if a 
   uddiTModelKey is assigned to the address structure. By doing this, 
   the otherwise arbitrary use of address lines becomes structured. 
   Together with the address' uddiTModelKey, keyName and keyValue 
   virtually build a uddiKeyedReference that represents an address line 
   qualifier, given by the referenced uddiTModel.  
    
   When no uddiTModelKey is provided for the address structure, the 
   keyName and keyValue attributes can be used without restrictions, 
   for example, to provide descriptive information for each 
   uddiAddressLine by using the keyName attribute. Since both the 
   keyName and the keyValue attributes are optional, address line order

   The keyName, keyValue, and addressData of this attribute are 
   separated by "#", (e.g. "#"<keyName>"#"<keyValue>"#"<addressData>).  
   The addressData is the only required portion of the attribute. 
    
4.14 uddiIdentifierBag 
    
   The uddiIdentifierBag element allows uddiBusinessEntity or 
   uddiTModel structures to include information about common forms of 
   identification such as D-U-N-S_ numbers, tax identifiers, etc. This 
   data can be used to signify the identity of the uddiBusinessEntity, 
   or can be used to signify the identity of the publishing party. 
   Including data of this sort is optional, but when used greatly 
   enhances the search behaviors exposed via the find_xx messages 
   defined in the UDDI Version 2.0 API Specification [UDDI]. For a full 
   description of the structures involved in establishing an identity, 
   see UDDI Version 2.0 Data Structure Specification - Appendix A:

4.15 uddiCategoryBag 
    
   The uddiCategoryBag element allows uddiBusinessEntity, 
   uddiBusinessService and uddiTModel structures to be categorized 
   according to any of several available taxonomy based classification 
   schemes. Operator Sites automatically provide validated 
   categorization support for three taxonomies that cover industry 
   codes (via NAICS), product and service classifications (via UNSPC) 
   and geography (via ISO 3166). Including data of this sort is 
   optional, but when used greatly enhances the search behaviors

   The tModel, keyName, and keyValue of this attribute are separated by 
   "#", (e.g. <tModel>"#"<keyName>"#"<keyValue>).  The keyValue is the 
   only required portion of the attribute. 
    
   With UDDIv3, uddiBindingTemplates also supports the uddiCategoryBag 
   element and they can also be categorized according to any of several 
   available taxonomy based classification schemes. 
    
4.16 uddiKeyedReference 
    
   The uddiKeyedReference is a general-purpose attribute for a name-
   value pair, with an additional reference to a tModel.

   The tModel, keyName, and keyValue of this attribute are separated by 
   "#", (e.g. <tModel>"#"<keyName>"#"<keyValue>).  The keyValue is the 
   only required portion of the attribute. With UDDIv3, the tModelKey 
   also becomes mandatory part of the attribute.  
    
   Also, UDDIv3 defines KeyedReferenceGroups for CategoryBags. A 
   keyedReferenceGroup contains a tModelKey and a simple list of 
   KeyedReference structures. The uddiKeyedReference attribute will 
   support KeyedReferenceGroups by suffixing the tModelKey for 
   KEyedReferenceGroup to each of the keyedReference values associated 
   with the group. 
   e.g. to represent a keyedReference group containing a list of 2 
   keyed references, the attribute will hold the following 2 strings as 
   its values: 
   tModelKey1#KeyName1#KeyValue1#KeyedReferenceGroup1_tModelKey 
   tModelKey2#KeyName2#KeyValue2#KeyedReferenceGroup1_tModelKey 
    
    
4.17 uddiServiceKey 
    
   This is the unique key for a given uddiBusinessService. When saving 
   a new uddiBusinessService structure, pass an empty uddiServiceKey

   value. This signifies that a UUID value is to be generated. To 
   update an existing uddiBusinessService structure, pass the UUID 
   value that corresponds to the existing service. If an uddiServiceKey 
   is received via an inquiry operation, the key values may not be 
   blank. When saving a new or updated service projection, pass the 
   uddiServiceKey of the referenced uddiBusinessService structure. 
    
   This attribute is optional when the uddiBindingTemplate data is 
   contained within a fully expressed parent that already contains a 
   uddiServiceKey value. If the uddiBindingTemplate data is rendered 
   into XML and has no containing parent that has within its data a 
   uddiServiceKey, the value of the uddiServiceKey that is the ultimate 
   containing parent of the uddiBindingTemplate is required to be 
   provided. This behavior supports the ability to browse through the 
   parent-child relationships given any of the core elements as a 
   starting point.

   value. This signifies that a UUID value is to be generated. To 
   update an existing uddiBindingTemplate, pass the UUID value that

4.19 uddiAccessPoint 
    
   The uddiAccessPoint element is an attribute-qualified pointer to a 
   service entry point. The notion of service at the metadata level 
   seen here is fairly abstract and many types of entry points are 
   accommodated. A single attribute is provided named URLType. 
    
   Required attribute qualified element8. This element is a text field 
   that is used to convey the entry point address suitable for calling

   a particular Web service. This may be a URL, an electronic mail 
   address, or even a telephone number. No assumptions about the type 
   of data in this field can be made without first understanding the 
   technical requirements associated with the Web service.

     SINGLE-VALUE 
   ) 
    
   The URLType value precedes the accessPoint value by a separating 
   '#'. 
    
   With UDDIv3,the ÊURLType∆ attribute is replaced by a ÊUseType∆ 
   attribute. Using this UseType attribute, the accessPoint attribute 
   can model a hostingRedirector or support indirection to indicate the 
   accesspoint is specified within a remotely hosted WSDL document.   
    
   For a UDDIv3 registry that needs support UDDIv2 clients, the 
   attribute must allow representing the URLType and UseType values 
   independently.  
    
   The UDDIv3 spec specifies the following logic for mapping values 
   between URLType and UseType: If an entity is saved with the v3 
   namespace and a v2 inquiry is made, the URLType will be returned as 
   "other". In the case when a v3 inquiry is made on an entity 
   published with the v2 namespace, the v3 useType attribute will be 
   returned as "endPoint". 
    
   For implementations that need to explicitly model both forms, the 
   recommended format is as follows: v2URLType#v3UseType#Address 
    
4.20 uddiHostingRedirector 
    
   The uddiHostingRedirector element is used to designate that a 
   uddiBindingTemplate entry is a pointer to a different 
   uddiBindingTemplate entry. The value in providing this facility is 
   seen when a business or entity wants to expose a service description 
   (e.g. advertise that they have a service available that suits a 
   specific purpose) that is actually a service that is described in a 
   separate uddiBindingTemplate record. This might occur when a service 
   is remotely hosted (hence the name of this element), or when many 
   service descriptions could benefit from a single service 
   description. 
    
   The uddiHostingRedirector element has a single attribute and no 
   element content. The attribute is a uddiBindingKey value that is

   suitable within the same UDDI registry instance for querying and 
   obtaining the uddiBindingDetail data that is to be used. 
    
   More on the uddiHostingRedirector can be found in the appendices for 
   the UDDI Version 2.0 API Specification. 
    
   Required element if uddiAccessPoint not provided. This element is 
   adorned with a uddiBindingKey attribute, giving the redirected 
   reference to a different uddiBindingTemplate. If you query a 
   uddiBindingTemplate and find a uddiHostingRedirector value, you 
   should retrieve that uddiBindingTemplate and use it in place of the 
   one containing the uddiHostingRedirector data.

   With UDDIv3, the hostingRedirector is a deprecated element, since 
   its functionality is now covered by the accessPoint. For backward-
   compatibility, it can still be used, but it is not recommended. 
    
4.21 uddiInstanceDescription 
    
   This is an optional repeating element. This is one or more language 
   qualified text descriptions that designate what role a uddiTModel 
   reference plays in the overall service description.

   The uddiInstance Parms is an Optional element of the uddiInstance. 
   Used to contain settings parameters or a URL reference to a file 
   that contains settings or parameters required to use a specific 
   facet of a uddiBindingTemplate description. If used to house the 
   parameters themselves, the suggested content is a namespace 
   qualified XML string ˚ using a namespace outside of the UDDI schema. 
   If used to house a URL pointer to a file, the suggested format is 
   URL that is suitable for retrieving the settings or parameters via 
   HTTP-GET.

4.24 uddiOverviewURL 
    
   This is an optional element. This string data element is to be used 
   to hold a URL reference to a long form of an overview document that 
   covers the way a particular uddiTModel specific reference is used as 
   a component of an overall web service description. The recommended 
   format for the overviewURL is a URI that is suitable for retrieving 
   the actual overview document with an HTTP GET operation, for 
   example, via a Web browser.

   With UDDIv3, uddiOverviewURL becomes multi-valued, to allow 
   representing multiple OverviewDocs within a single InstanceDetail 
   element. 
    
   Modeling multiple OverviewDocs within an InstanceDetail element: 
   In UDDIv3, InstanceDetails element in TmodelInstanceInfo can have

   overviewURL, we can make both OverviewDoc and OverviewURL multi-

   valued. And have a Êgroup ID∆ Prefix to each value (to group 
   OverviewDescriptions and OverviewURL).  
    
   An example is shown below: 
        Overview Description                            OverviewURL 
        1#xml:lang#overviewDescription1         1#UseType#overviewURL

        3#xml:lang#overviewDescription1 
        3#xml:lang#overviewDescription2 
        4#xml:lang#overviewDescription1 
    
   This implies that OverviewDoc1 has 3 overview descriptions and an 
   overviewURL. OverviewDoc2 has only an overviewURL. OverviewDoc3 has 
   only 2 overviewDescriptions. OverviewDoc4 also has 1 overview 
   description and an overviewURL.

   This is the unique UDDIv3 identifier for a given instance of an 
   uddiTModel. 
    
   A uddiTModel will include the uddiTModelKey (the v2 form) for unique 
   identification by UDDIv2 clients. The uddiTModelKey (41-char) will 
   also be the LDAP naming attribute for the uddiTModel entry. The

   The tModelKey is also used in a KeyedReference and in Address 
   structures. At all places, where a tModelKey is used as a reference 
   to tModel, the v3 form of the tModel key (viz. uddiv3TModelKey) will 
   be the form used, since using the v2 form key will require 
   translating it to the v3 key by the UDDI Server and this may 
   invalidate the digital signature of the entity.  
    
4.35 uddiv3DigitalSignature 
    
   The UDDIv3 v3 schema supports signing of the following UDDI elements 
   using ÊXML-Signature Syntax and Processing∆ (see 
   http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/). 
   ..businessEntity 
   ..businessService 
   ..bindingTemplate 
   ..tModel 
   ..publisherAssertion 
    
   This uddiv3DigitalSignature attribute holds the digital signature 
   for the corresponding UDDI entity.

   A Signature element SHOULD be generated according to the required 
   steps of "Core Generation" in XML-Signature Syntax and Processing. 
   The signature should be calculated on the top level element that 
   will be stored by the registry as a result of the Publication API 
   call. This element, referred to as the data object in the 
   XMLSignature and Syntax specification, is the businessEntity element 
   for save_business API calls, the businessService element for 
   save_service API calls, the bindingTemplate for save_binding 
   API calls, the tModel for save_tModel API calls and the 
   publisherAssertion for set_publisherAssertions and 
   add_publisherAssertion API calls.  
    
   The signature should be generated on the elements before they are 
   added to the body of an API call. Also, according to the signature 
   generation, all children of the element being signed are included in 
   the generation of the signature unless first excluded by application 
   of a transform. Due to the containment of service projections as 
   businessService elements within a businessEntity element, this also 
   means that changes to the projected service will render a signature 
   of the businessEntity containing the projection invalid, unless a 
   businessService element representing a service projection is 
   excluded using a transform. 
    
   Due to the location of the sequence of Signature elements within an 
   element that is to be signed, the signature is "enveloped". As a 
   result of the enveloping of the signature, it is necessary to apply 
   at least one transformation on the signed entity to exclude the 
   signature or signature(s). The transformation selected by a 
   publisher or the XML Signature tool is specified in a Transform 
   element inside the Signature element.

   This attribute is used to maintain the last modification time for a 
   UDDI entity. It is needed in context of maintaining the 
   modifiedIncludingChildren element. When a child entity (e.g. 
   uddiBindingTemplate) is updated, the parent entity (e.g. 
   uddiBusinessService) LDAP timestamp also gets updated. The 
   uddiv3EntityModificationTime attribute saves the last modification 
   time of the parent entity (uddiBusinessService in this case).

   The following attribute definitions define attributes related to 
   modeling of UDDIv3 subscription related entities in LDAP directory. 
    
   Subscription provides clients, known as subscribers, with the 
   ability to register their interest in receiving information 
   concerning changes made in a UDDI registry. These changes can be 
   scoped based on preferences provided with the request. The 
   uddiv3Subscription object class is used to model registered UDDIv3 
   Subscriptions.  
    
4.38 uddiv3SubscriptionKey 
    
   This is the unique UDDIv3 identifier for a given instance of a 
   uddiv3Subscription entity.

   This attribute contains the UDDIv3 Subscription Filter, specified as 
   part of the save_subscription API i.e. the Inquiry API specified as 
   filtering criteria with a registered subscription. The filtering 
   criteria limits the scope of a subscription to a subset of registry 
   records. The get_xx and find_xx APIs are all valid choices for use 
   as a subscriptionFilter. Only one of these can be chosen for each 
   subscription.

   This is the unique UDDIv3 identifier for a given instance of a core 
   UDDI data structure that is to be logged as an Obituary Entry 
   uddiv3EntityObituary. When a core UDDIv3 entity is deleted and there 
   is an active subscription registered against this UDDI entity, an 
   Obituary entry is created, in which the v3 key of the deleted entry 
   is logged as part of the uddiv3EntityKey attribute.

   This attribute is used to log the original Creation Time for a UDDI 
   Entity that is deleted, in the uddiv3EntityObituary entry.  
    
   It is also used in uddiBusinessService and uddiBindingTemplate. A 
   Move BS operation needs to delete and recreate BT sub-tree due to 
   lack of support for moving a sub-tree in many LDAPv3 servers. This 
   attribute is used to save the original creation time of the BT 
   during a Move BS.

8. Security Considerations 
    
   Storing UDDI data into the directory enables the data to be examined 
   and used outside the environment in which it was originally created.  
   The directory entry containing the UDDI data could be read and 
   modified within the constraints imposed by the access control 
   mechanisms of the directory. With UDDIv3 [UDDIv3], publishers can 
   digitally sign UDDI Entities enabling registry clients to validate 
   the integrity of entries read from the UDDIv3 registry by verifying 
   the digital signature. 
    
   Each UDDI Entity has an uddiAuthorizedName attribute which contains 
   an LDAP DN identifying the publisher/owner. The referenced LDAP 
   object can provide the public key of the signer to a registry client 
   for integrity validation of the UDDI Entity.   
    
   Other general LDAP [LDAPv3] security considerations apply. Some of 
   the UDDI attributes like AccessPoints for services may contain 
   sensitive information. Use of strong authentication mechanisms and 
   data integrity/confidentiality services [RFC2829][RFC2830] is 
   advised. 
    
    
9. IANA Considerations 
 
   Refer to RFC 3383, "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) 
   Considerations for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)" 
   [RFC3383].
