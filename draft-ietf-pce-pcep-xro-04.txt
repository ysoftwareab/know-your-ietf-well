   Abstract 
    
   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path 
   computation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol 
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. 
    
   When a Path Computation Client (PCC) requests a PCE for a route, it 
   may be useful for the PCC to specify, as constraints to the path 
   computation, abstract nodes, resources, and Shared Risk Link Groups 
   (SRLGs) that are to be explicitly excluded from the computed route. 
   Such constraints are termed route exclusions.

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity 
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a 
   network graph, and applying computational constraints. A Path 
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be 
   computed. 
    
   When a PCC requests a PCE for a route, it may be useful for the PCC 
   to specify abstract nodes, resources, and Shared Risk Link Groups 
   (SRLGs) that are to be explicitly excluded from the route. 
    
   For example, disjoint paths for inter-domain LSPs may be computed by 
   cooperation between PCEs, each of which computes segments of the 
   paths across one domain. In order to achieve path computation for a 
   secondary (backup) path, a PCE may act as a PCC to request another 
   PCE for a route that must be node/link/SRLG disjoint from the 
   primary (working) path. Another example is where a network operator 
   wants a path to avoid specified nodes for administrative reasons, 
   perhaps because the specified nodes will be out-of-services in the 
   near future. 
    
   [RFC4657] specifies generic requirements for a communication 
   protocol between PCCs and PCEs. Generic constraints described in 
   [RFC4657] include route exclusions for links, nodes, and SRLGs. That 
   is, the requirement for support of route exclusions within the PCC-
   PCE communication protocol is already established. 
    
   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication 
   protocol between PCCs and PCEs and is defined in [PCEP]. This 
   document presents PCEP extensions to satisfy the requirements for 
   route exclusions as described in Sections 5.1.4 and 5.1.16 of 
   [RFC4657]. 
    
   Note that MPLS-TE and GMPLS signaling extensions for communicating 
   route exclusions between network nodes for specific Label Switched 
   Paths (LSPs) are described in [RFC4874]. Route exclusions may be 
   specified during provisioning requests for specific LSPs by setting 
   the mplsTunnelHopInclude object of MPLS-TE-STD-MIB defined in 
   [RFC3812] to false (2). 
    
2. Protocol Procedures and Extensions 
    
   This section describes the procedures adopted by a PCE handling a 
   request for path computation with route exclusions received from a 
   PCC, and defines how those exclusions are encoded. 
    
   There are two types of route exclusion described in [RFC4874]. 
    
   1. Exclusion of certain abstract nodes or resources from the whole 
      path. This set of abstract nodes is referred to as the Exclude

      Route List. 
    
   2. Exclusion of certain abstract nodes or resources between a 
      specific pair of abstract nodes present in an explicit path. Such 
      specific exclusions are referred to as an Explicit Route 
      Exclusion. 
    
   This document defines protocol extensions to allow a PCC to specify 
   both types of route exclusions to a PCE on a path computation 
   request. 
    
   A new PCEP object, the Exclude Route Object (XRO), is defined to 
   convey the Exclude Route List. The existing Include Route Object 
   (IRO) in PCEP [PCEP] is modified by introducing a new IRO subobject, 
   the Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS), to convey Explicit 
   Route Exclusions. 
    
2.1.  Exclude Route Object (XRO) 
    
 2.1.1. Definition 
    
   The XRO is OPTIONAL and MAY be carried within PCReq and PCRep 
   messages.  
    
   When present in a PCReq message, the XRO provides a list of network 
   resources that the PCE is requested to exclude from the path that it 
   computes. Flags associated with each list member instruct the PCE as 
   to whether the network resources must be excluded from the computed 
   path, or whether the PCE should make best efforts to exclude the 
   resources from the computed path. 
    
   The XRO MAY be used on a PCRep message that carries the NO-PATH 
   object (i.e., one that reports a path computation failure) to 
   indicate the set of elements of the original XRO that prevented the 
   PCE from finding a path.  
    
   The XRO MAY also be used on a PCRep message for a successful path 
   computation when the PCE wishes to provide a set of exclusions to be 
   signaled during LSP setup using the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC4874].  
    
   The XRO Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA (recommended 
   value=17)

   Flags: 16 bits - The following flags are currently defined: 
    
     F (Fail - 1 bit): when set, the requesting PCC requires the  
     computation of a new path for an existing TE LSP that has failed. 
     If the F bit is set, the path of the existing TE LSP MUST be  
     provided in the PCReq message by means of an RRO object defined in  
     [PCEP]. This allows the path computation to take into account the  
     previous path and reserved resources to avoid double bandwidth  
     booking should the TED have not yet been updated or the  
     corresponding resources not be yet been released. This will  
     usually be used in conjunction with the exclusion from the path  
     computation of the failed resource that caused the LSP to fail. 
    
   Subobjects. The XRO is up made of one or more subobject(s). An XRO 
   with no subobjects MUST NOT be sent and SHOULD be ignored on receipt. 
    
   In the following subobject definitions a set of fields have 
   consistent meaning as follows: 
    
      X 
        The X-bit indicates whether the exclusion is mandatory or  
        desired. 0 indicates that the resource specified MUST be  
        excluded from the path computed by the PCE. 1 indicates that 
        the  
        resource specified SHOULD be excluded from the path computed by 
        the PCE, but MAY be included subject to PCE policy and the  
        absence of a viable path that meets the other constraints and  
        excludes the resource.

        5              SRLG 
    
      Length 
        The length of the subobject including the Type and Length 
          fields. 
    
      Prefix Length 
        Where present, this field can be used to indicate a set of 
         addresses matching a prefix. If the subobject indicates a  
         single address, the prefix length MUST be set to the full  
         length of the address. 
    
      Attribute 
        The Attribute field indicates how the exclusion subobject is to 
        be interpreted. 
    
        0 Interface 
          The subobject is to be interpreted as an interface or set of 
           interfaces. All interfaces identified by the subobject are 
          to 
           be excluded from the computed path according to the setting  
           of the X-bit. This value is valid only for subobject types 1,  
           2, and 3. 
    
        1 Node 
           The subobject is to be interpreted as a node or set of nodes.  
           All nodes identified by the subobject are to be excluded 
         from  
           the computed path according to the setting of the X-bit. 
         This  
           value is valid only for subobject types 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
    
        2 SRLG 
           The subobject identifies an SRLG explicitly or indicates all  
           of the SRLGs associated with the resource or resources  
           identified by the subobject. Resources that share any SRLG  
           with those identified are to be excluded from the computed  
           path according to the setting of the X-bit. This value is  
           valid for all subobjects.

 2.1.2. Processing Rules 
    
   A PCC builds an XRO to encode all of the resources that it wishes 
   the PCE to exclude from the path that it is requested to compute. 
   For each exclusion, the PCC clears the X-bit to indicate that the 
   PCE is required to exclude the resources, or sets the X-bit to 
   indicate that the PCC simply desires that the resources are excluded. 
   For each exclusion, the PCC also sets the Attribute field to 
   indicate how the PCE should interpret the contents of the exclusion 
   subobject. 
    
   When a PCE receives a PCReq message it looks for an XRO to see if 
   exclusions are required. If the PCE finds more than one XRO it MUST 
   use the first one in the message and MUST ignore subsequent 
   instances. 
    
   If the PCE does not recognize the XRO it MUST return a PCErr message 
   with Error-Type "Unknown Object" as described in [PCEP]. 
    
   If the PCE is unwilling on unable to process the XRO it MUST return 
   a PCErr message with the Error-Type "Not supported object" and 
   follow the relevant procedures described in [PCEP]. 
    
   If the PCE processes the XRO and attempts to compute a path, it MUST 
   adhere to the requested exclusions as expressed in the XRO. That is,

   the returned path MUST NOT include any resources encoded with the X-
   bit clear, and SHOULD NOT include any with the X-bit set unless 
   alternate paths that match the other constraints expressed in the 
   PCReq are unavailable. 
    
   When a PCE returns a path in a PCRep it MAY also supply an XRO. An 
   XRO in a PCRep message with the NO-PATH object indicates that the 
   set of elements of the original XRO prevented the PCE from finding a 
   path. On the other hand, if an XRO is present in a PCRep message 
   without a NO-PATH object, the PCC SHOULD apply the contents using 
   the same rules as in [RFC4874] and the PCC or a corresponding LSR 
   SHOULD signal an RSVP-TE XRO to indicate the exclusions that 
   downstream LSRs should apply. This may be particularly useful in 
   per-domain path computation scenarios [RFC5152].  
    
    
2.2.  Explicit Route Exclusion 
    
 2.2.1. Definition 
    
   Explicit Route Exclusion defines network elements that must not or 
   should not be used on the path between two abstract nodes or 
   resources explicitly indicated in the Include Route Object (IRO) 
   [PCEP]. This information is encoded by defining a new subobject for 
   the IRO. 
    
   The new IRO subobject, the Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS), 
   has type defined by IANA (see Section 3.). The EXRS contains one or 
   more subobjects in its own right. An EXRS MUST NOT be sent with no 
   subobjects, and if received with no subobjects MUST be ignored. 
    
   The format of the EXRS is as follows: 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3

         receipt. 
    
   The EXRS subobject may carry any of the subobjects defined for 
   inclusion in the XRO by this document or by future documents. The 
   meanings of the fields of the XRO subobjects are unchanged when the 
   subobjects are included in an EXRS, except that scope of the 
   exclusion is limited to the single hop between the previous and 
   subsequent elements in the IRO. 
    
 2.2.2. Processing Rules 
    
   A PCC that supplies a partial explicit route to a PCE in an IRO MAY 
   also specify explicit exclusions by including one or more EXRSes in 
   the IRO.  
    
   If a PCE parses an IRO in a received PCReq message and encounters an 
   EXRS and does not recognize the subobject it MUST respond with a 
   PCErr message using the Error-Type "Unrecognized IRO subobject" and 
   set the Error-Value to the subobject type code of the EXRS. 
    
   If a PCE parses an IRO and encounters an EXRS that it recognizes, 
   but detects an EXRS subobject that it does not recognize it MUST act 
   according to the setting of the X-bit in the subobject. If the X-bit 
   is clear, the PCE MUST respond with a PCErr with Error-Type 
   "Unrecognized EXRS subobject" and set the Error-Value to the EXRS 
   subobject type code (see Section 4). If the X-bit is set, the PCE 
   MAY respond with a PCErr as already stated or MAY ignore the EXRS 
   subobject: this choice is a local policy decision. 
    
   If a PCE parses an IRO and encounters an EXRS subobject that it 
   recognizes, it MUST act according to the requirements expressed in 
   the subobject. That is, if the X-bit is clear, the PCE MUST NOT 
   produce a path that includes any resource identified by the EXRS 
   subobject in the path between the previous abstract node in the IRO 
   and the next abstract node in the IRO. If the X-bit is set, the PCE 
   SHOULD NOT produce a path that includes any resource identified by 
   the EXRS subobject in the path between the previous abstract node in 
   the IRO and the next abstract node in the IRO unless it is not 
   possible to construct a path that avoids that resource while still 
   complying with the other constraints expressed in the PCReq message. 
    
   A successful path computation reported in a PCRep message MUST 
   include an ERO to specify the path that has been computed as 
   specified in [PCEP]. That ERO MAY contain specific route exclusions 
   using the EXRS as specified in [RFC4874]. 
    
   If the path computation fails and a PCErr is returned with a NO-PATH 
   object, the PCE MAY include an IRO to report the hops that could not

   be complied with as described in [PCEP], and that IRO MAY include 
   EXRSes. 
    
    
    
3. Exclude Route with Confidentiality 
    
3.1.  Exclude Route Object (XRO) Carrying Path Key  
    
 3.1.1. Definition 
    
   In PCE-based inter-domain diverse path computation, an XRO may be 
   used to find a backup (secondary) path. A sequential path 
   computation approach may be applied for this purpose, where a 
   working (primary) path route is computed first and a backup path 
   route that must be a node/link/SRLG disjoint route from the working 
   path is then computed [INTER-DOMAIN-REC-ANA]. Backward Recursive 
   Path Computation (BRPC) may be used for inter-domain path 
   computation [BRPC].  
    
   In some cases of inter-domain computation (e.g., where domains are 
   administered by different service providers), confidentiality must 
   be kept. For primary path computation, to preserve confidentiality, 
   instead of explicitly expressing the computed route, Path Key 
   Subobjects (PKSs) [PCE-PATH-KEY] are carried in the Explicit Route 
   Object (ERO) in the PCRep Message. 
    
   Therefore, during inter-domain diverse path computation, it may be 
   necessary to request diversity from a path that is not fully known 
   and where a segment of the path is represented by a PKS. This means 
   that a PKS may be present as a subobject of the XRO on a PCReq 
   message.  
    
   The format and definition of PKS when it appears as an XRO subobject 
   are as defined in [PCE-PATH-KEY], except for the definition of L bit. 
   The L bit of the PKS subobject in the XRO is defined as follows.  
    
   L 
     The L bit MUST be ignored. 
    
 3.1.2. Processing Rules 
    
   Consider that BRPC is applied for both working and backup path 
   computation in a sequential manner. First, PCC requests PCE for the 
   computation of a working path. After BRPC processing has completed, 
   the PCC receives the results of the working-path computation 
   expressed in an ERO in a PCRep message. The ERO may include PKSs if 
   certain segments of the path are to be kept confidential.

          Extensions to PCEP for Route Exclusions   March 2008 
    
   For backup path computation, when the PCC constructs a PCReq Message, 
   it includes the entire working-path in the XRO so that the computed 
   path is node/link disjoint from the working path. The XRO may also 
   include SRLGs to ensure SRLG diversity from the working path. If the 
   working path ERO includes PKS subobjects, these are also included in 
   the XRO to allow the PCE to ensure diversity. 
    
   A set of PCEs for backup path computation may be the same as ones 
   for working path computation, or they may be different.  
    
   - Identical PCEs 
    
      In the case where the same PCEs are used for both path 
   computations, the processing is as follows. During the process of 
   BRPC for backup path computation, a PCE may encounter a PKS as it 
   processes the XRO when it creates a virtual path tree (VPT) in its 
   own domain. The PCE retrieves the PCE-ID from the PKS, recognizes 
   itself, and converts the PKS into a set of XRO subobjects which it 
   uses for the local calculation to create the VPT. The XRO subobjects 
   created in this way MUST NOT be shared with other PCEs. Other 
   operations are the same as BRPC. 
    
   - Different PCEs 
    
      In the case where a set of PCEs for bakup path computation is 
   different from the ones used for working path computation, the 
   processing is as follows. If a PCE encounters a PKS in an XRO when 
   it is creating a virtual path tree in its own domain, the PCE 
   retrieves the PCE-ID from the PKS and sends a PCReq message to the 
   identified PCE to expand the PKS. The PCE computing the VPT treats 
   the path segment in the response as a set of XRO subobjects in 
   performing its path computation. The XRO subobjects determined in 
   this way MUST NOT be shared with other PCEs.  
    
4. IANA Considerations 
    
  4.1. PCEP Objects 
    
   The "PCEP Parameters" registry contains a subregistry "PCEP Objects". 
   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from this 
   registry.

   [PCEP] and removed from this document. 
    
      12      Unrecognized EXRS subobject 
    
5. Manageability Considerations 
    
   A MIB module for management of the PCEP is specified in a separate 
   document. This MIB module allows examination of individual PCEP 
   messages, in particular requests, responses and errors.  
    
   The MIB module MUST be extended to include the ability to view the 
   route exclusion extensions defined in this document. 
    
   Several local policy decisions should be made at the PCE. Firstly, 
   the exact behavior with regard to desired exclusions must be 
   available for examination by an operator and may be configurable. 
   Second, the behavior on receipt of an unrecognized XRO or EXRS 
   subobject with the X-bit set should be configurable and must be 
   available for inspection. The inspection and control of these local 
   policy choices may be part of the PCEP MIB module. 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   The new exclude route mechanisms defined in this document allow 
   finer and more specific control of the path computed by a PCE. Such 
   control increases the risk if a PCEP message is intercepted,

   modified, or spoofed. Therefore, the security techniques described 
   in [PCEP] are considered more important. 
    
   Note, however, that the roue exclusion mechanisms also provide the 
   operator with the ability to route around vulnerable parts of the 
   network and may be used to increase overall network security.
