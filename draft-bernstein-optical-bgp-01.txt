1  Introduction 
    
   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has received much attention 
   recently for use as a control plane for non-packet switched 
   technologies.  In particular, optical technologies have a need to 
   upgrade their control plane as reviewed in reference [2]. Many

   different optical switching and multiplexing technologies exist and 
   more are sure to come.  For the purposes of this draft we only 
   consider non-packet (i.e. circuit switching) forms of optical 
   switching.   
   As the requirements for and extensions to interior gateway protocols 
   such as OSPF and IS-IS have begun to be investigated in the single 
   area case, e.g., reference [3], we consider the requirements that 
   optical networking and switching impose in the inter-domain case.  
   By inter-domain in this draft we consider inter-area, inter-layer, 
   and inter-vendor partitioning of routing and possibly other 
   possibilities for partitioning routing in addition to administrative 
   inter-domain (inter-carrier) partitioning. Comparisons of these 
   requirements to existing functionality in BGP, multi-area OSPF and 
   hierarchical PNNI will be made. 
   In particular, optical routing needs to provide for path diversity, 
   switching capabilities, transport capabilities and impairments, and 
   bandwidth/resource status reporting.  
   To add to the concreteness of these considerations we try to 
   illustrate them with one or more specific examples from a particular 
   optical networking layer or technology. This is not to reduce the 
   generality of the requirement but to facilitate the understanding of 
   the requirement or concept.

2  Background  
    
   The motivation for inter domain routing in optical networks (circuit 
   switched) is very similar to that in the case of IP datagram 
   routing. 
         
        1. Distribute "reachability" information throughout an   
           internetwork. An internetwork consists of an interconnected 
           set of networks under different routing and/or 
           administrative domains.

        2. Maintain a clear separation between distinct administrative 
           or routing domains. 
         
        3. Provide "information hiding" on the internal structure of 
           the distinct administrative or routing domains. 
         
        4. Limit the scope of interior gateway routing protocols. This 
           is for security, scalability reliability and policy reasons. 
         
        5. Provide for address/route aggregation. 
    
2.1 Major Differences between Optical and IP datagram Routing 
    
   Let us first review the major difference between routing for optical 
   (circuit switched networks) and IP datagram networks.  In IP 
   datagram networks packet forwarding is done on a hop-by-hop basis 
   (no connection established ahead of time).  While circuit switched 
   optical networks end to end connections must be explicitly 
   established based on network topology and resource status 
   information.  This topology and resource status information can be 
   obtained via routing protocols. Note that the routing protocols in 
   the circuit switch case are not involved with data (or bit) 
   forwarding, i.e., they are not "service impacting", while in the IP 
   datagram case the routing protocols are explicitly involved with 
   data plane forwarding decisions and hence are very much service 
   impacting.  
    
   This does not imply routing is unimportant in the optical case, only 
   that its service impacting effect is secondary.  For example, 
   topology and resource status inaccuracies will affect whether a new 
   connection can be established (or a restoration connection can be 
   established) but will not (and should not) cause an existing 
   connection to be torn down. 
    
   This tends to lead to a slightly different view towards 
   incorporating new information fields (objects, LSA, etc.) into 
   optical routing protocols versus IP routing protocols.  In the 
   optical circuit case, any information that can potentially aid in 
   route computations or be used in service differentiation may be 
   incorporated into the route protocol, as either a standard element 
   or a vendor specific extension.  Whether a route computation 
   algorithm uses this information and whether two route computation 
   algorithms use this information in the same way doesn’t matter since 
   the optical connections are explicitly routed (although perhaps 
   loosely). The optical route computation problem is really a 
   constraint-based routing problem. The basic route calculation is an 
   atomic service that occurs, for a given connection, in a single 
   network element. (In the case of loose explicit routing some details 
   may be filled in by other NE’s.) This means that, even in a 
   heterogeneous optical network, NEs from different vendors need not 
   use the same algorithm.  
    
  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 4] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   Another difference - clear, hard blocking prevails in the optical 
   world while some level of overloading is ok in the IP world, i.e., 
   statistical multiplexing is not available with optical circuits.  
   This also manifests itself in the commitment of the protection (or 
   restoration) bandwidth. In a packet-based network although the 
   protection path can be setup prior to any fault, the resources along 
   the protection path are not used until the failure occurs.  In 
   circuit-based networks a protection path generally implies a 
   committed resource. Such a basic difference restricts the direct 
   applicability of some of the traffic engineering mechanisms used in 
   a packet-based network to a circuit-based network. 
 
2.2 Reachability  
    
   The main goal of path selection (route computation) is to find the 
   best path(s) between a set of <source, destination> pairs satisfying 
   a given set of constraints and possibly network optimality 
   conditions. To aid in performing such path computation routing 
   protocols carry information related to the topology of the 
   network(characteristics of the links, nodes, subnetworks and 
   domains).  
 
   Associated with a subnetwork we can ask what systems can be reached 
   via this subnetwork.  These systems can be nodes within the network, 
   end systems (clients) to the network, or other subnetworks.  Now 
   this reachability information isn't too valuable unless there is at 
   least one known path to reach that subnetwork.  
 
2.3 Capability and Capacity Advertisement 
    
2.3.1   Subnetwork Capability Advertisement 
    
   In addition to understanding what systems are directly reachable via 
   a subnetwork it can be important to know about the capabilities or 
   features offered by the subnetwork. Subnetwork information we will 
   want to know includes: 
        1. Switching capabilities 
        2. Protection Capabilities 
        3. Available Capacity 
        4. Reliability Measures (if available) 
         
   Examples: 
   1.  For example, in the SONET realm, one subnetwork may switch down 
       to an STS-3c granularity while another switches down to an STS-1 
       granularity.  Understanding what types of signals within a 
       SDH/SONET multiplex structure can be switched by a subnetwork is 
       important.  Similar examples of granularity in switching apply 
       to the waveband case. 
   2.  Some networking technologies, particularly SONET/SDH, provide a 
       wide range of standardized protection technologies. But not all 
       subnetworks will offer all protection options.  For example, a 
       2/4-F BLSR based subnetwork could offer extra data traffic, ring 
       protected traffic and non-preemptible unprotected traffic, 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 5] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
       (NUT)[4], while a mesh network might offer shared SONET line 
       layer linear protection and some form of mesh protection. 
   3.  Capacity information can be tricky to represent for an entire 
       subnetwork. More than likely a subnetwork that provides a 
       "transit" service would offer some type of summarized 
       topological model from which capacity constrained routing 
       decisions could be made. 
   4.  Some subnetworks may be in locations that have lower incidences 
       of link failure.  Such information could be helpful in computing 
       routes to statistically "share the pain".                                     
 
   The type of regeneration (if any) done at the NNI by each subnetwork 
   will also need to be known. There are several reasons for this: 
   1. When entering or leaving an all-optical subnetwork, the 
   impairment budget available for the next subnetwork will depend on 
   this; 
   2. The routing process needs to be sensitive to the costs associated 
   with "island-hopping". 
    
   This last point needs elaboration. It is extremely important to 
   realize that, at least in the short to intermediate term, the 
   resources committed by a single routing decision can be very 
   significant: The equipment tied up by a single coast-to-coast OC-192 
   can easily have a first cost of $10**6, and the holding times on a 
   circuit once established is likely to be measured in months. 
   Carriers will expect the routing algorithms used to be sensitive to 
   these costs. Simplistic measures of cost such as the number of 
   "hops" are not likely to be acceptable. 
    
   Taking the case of an all-optical island consisting of an "ultra 
   long-haul" system embedded in an OEO network of electrical fabric 
   OLXC's as an example: It is likely that the ULH system will be 
   relatively expensive for short hops but relatively economical for 
   longer distances. It is therefore likely to be deployed as a sort of 
   "express backbone". In this scenario a carrier is likely to expect 
   the routing algorithm to balance OEO costs against the additional 
   costs associated with ULH technology and route circuitously to make 
   maximum use of the backbone where appropriate. Note that the metrics 
   used to do this must be consistent throughout the routing domain if 
   this expectation is to be met.  
 
 
2.3.2   End System Capabilities 
    
   While properties of the subnetwork are very important when trying to 
   decide which subnetwork to use to access a system (in the case of 
   multi-homing), end systems also posses a wide variety of 
   capabilities.  Throwing end system capabilities such as a systems 
   ability to support SONET/SDH virtual concatenation for distribution 
   into a routing protocol seems inappropriate since it counters the 
   ability to summarize.  If detailed end-system information is needed 
   by another end system then a directory service or some type of 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 6] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   direct query between the end systems that does not impact the 
   network seems more appropriate. 
    
2.4 Diversity in Optical Routing  
 
   There are two basic demands that drive the need to discover diverse 
   routes for establishing optical paths: 
        1. Reliability/Robustness 
        2. Bandwidth capacity. 
    
   Many times multiple optical connections are set up between the same 
   end points. An important constraint on these connections is that 
   they must be diversely routed in some way [5].  In particular they 
   could be routed over paths that are link diverse, i.e., two 
   connections do not share any common link. Or the more stringent 
   constraint that the two paths should be node diverse, i.e., the two 
   paths do not traverse any common node.  
     
   Additionally, insufficient bandwidth may exist to set up all the 
   desired connection across the same path (set of links) and hence we 
   need to know about alternative (diverse) ways of reaching the 
   destination that may still have unused capacity. 
 
   "Diversity" is a relationship between lightpaths. Two lightpaths are 
   said to be diverse if they have no single point of failure. In 
   traditional telephony the dominant transport failure mode is a 
   failure in the interoffice plant, such as a fiber cut inflicted by a 
   backhoe.  
    
   Data network operators have relied on their private line providers 
   to ensure diversity and so IP routing protocols have not had to deal 
   directly with the problem. GMPLS makes the complexities handled by 
   the private line provisioning process, including diversity, part of 
   the common control plane and so visible to all.  
    
   Diversity is discussed in the IPO WG document [6]. A key associated 
   concept, "Shared Risk Link Groups", is discussed in a number of 
   other IETF (refs) and OIF (refs) documents.  Some implications for 
   routing that are drawn in [6] are: 
     . Dealing with diversity is an unavoidable requirement for 
        routing in the optical layer.  It requires dealing with 
        constraints in the routing process but most importantly 
        requires additional state information – the SRLG relationships 
        and also the routings of any existing circuits from which the 
        new circuit is to be diverse – to be available to the routing 
        process. 
    
     . At present SRLG information cannot be self-discovered. Indeed, 
        in a large network it is very difficult to maintain accurate 
        SRLG information. The problem becomes particularly daunting 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 7] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
        whenever multiple administrative domains are involved, for 
        instance after the acquisition of one network by another, 
        because there normally is a likelihood that there are diversity 
        violations between the domains. It is very unlikely that 
        diversity relationships between carriers will be known any time 
        in the near future. 
 
    - Considerable variation in what different customers will mean by 
   acceptable diversity should be anticipated. Consequently we suggest 
   that an SRLG should be defined as follows: (i) It is a relationship 
   between two or more links, and (ii) it is characterized by two 
   parameters, the type of compromise (shared conduit, shared ROW, 
   shared optical ring, etc.) and the extent of the compromise (e.g., 
   the number of miles over which the compromise persisted). This will 
   allow the SRLG’s appropriate to a particular routing request to be 
   easily identified. 
    
2.4.1   Generalizing Link Diversity 
 
   Optical networks may posses a number of hierarchical signaling 
   layers.  For example two routers interconnected across an optical 
   network may communicate with IP packets encapsulated within an STS-
   48c SONET path layer signal.  Within the optical network this STS-
   48c signal may be multiplexed at the SONET line layer into an OC-192 
   line layer signal.  In addition this OC-192 may be wavelength 
   division multiplexed onto a fiber with other OC-192 signals at 
   different wavelengths (lambdas).  These WDM signals can then be 
   either lambda switched, wave band switched or fiber switched.  Hence 
   when we talk about diversity we need to specify the layer to which 
   we are referring.  In the previous example we can talk about 
   diversity with respect to the SONET line layer, wave bands, and/or 
   optical fibers.  A similar situation arises when we consider the 
   definition of node diversity.  For example are we talking with 
   respect to a SONET path layer switch or an optical switch or 
   multiplexer? 
 
     The Shared Risk Link Group concept in reference [7] generalizes 
   the notion of link diversity (general list of numbers).  First it's 
   useful with respect to major outages (cable cuts, natural disasters) 
   to have a few more types of diversity defined: 
    
        1. Cable (conduit) diversity (allows us to know which fibers 
           are in the same cable (conduit).  This helps avoid sending 
           signals over routes that are most vulnerable to "ordinary" 
           cable cuts (technically known as backhoe fades). 
         
        2. Right of Way (ROW) diversity.  This helps avoid sending 
           signals over routes that are subject to larger scale 
           disasters such as ship anchor drags, train derailments, etc. 
         
        3. Geographic Route diversity. This type of diversity can help 
           one avoid sending signals over routes that are subject to 
           various larger scale disasters such as earthquakes, floods, 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 8]

           tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.  A route could be approximately 
           described by a piecewise set of latitude/longitude or UTM 
           coordinate pairs. 
         
   We also have a form of link abstraction/summarization via the link 
   bundling concept [8]. 
    
2.4.2   Generalizing Node Diversity 
    
   The concept of a node abstraction associated with GMPLS appears in 
   reference [14] where it is used to generalize the concept of an 
   explicitly routed path.  In this case an abstract node can be a set 
   of IP addresses or an AS number. From the point of view of node 
   diverse routing specific concepts of interest include: 
     1. Nodes, i.e., individual switching elements.  
     2. Switching centers, i.e., a central office or exchange site. 
     3. Cities, or towns that contain more that one switching center. 
     4. Metro areas, or counties 
     5. States,  
     6. Countries, or  
     7. Geographic Regions 
    
   For example, although rumors of California's eventual slide into the 
   Pacific Ocean have been greatly exaggerated, some telecommunications 
   customers might prefer their Asia-bound traffic to egress at diverse 
   US west coast locations such as Washington State, Oregon and/or 
   California. 
 
3  Applications of Optical Inter Domain Routing  
 
3.1 Inter-Area Routing 
   Inter-area routing refers to a situation where the network that is 
   to be partitioned into areas is under the control of one 
   administrative entity. The main reasons for this partitioning in 
   optical networks stem from scalability, inter-vendor 
   interoperability, legacy equipment interoperability, and inter-layer 
   partitioning. 
    
3.1.1   Inter-Area Scalability 
   As networks grow it is useful to partition a routing domain into 
   areas where limited or summarized information is shared between 
   areas. This reduces the overhead of information exchange across the 
   network as a whole, and reduces the convergence time of routing 
   protocols within a particular area.  
    
   When the topology within the area is approximated then signaling and 
   call processing at the area border must specify an approximated 
   (loose) route and the border node must then translate this to a 
   precise route through the area.  Hence there is some linkage between 
   multi-domain connection control and inter-area/inter-domain routing. 
    
   Notes: This might also be valid in a multi domain case where there 
   is trust between domains. This might arise, e.g., after one network

   is acquired by another but not yet physically integrated; or between 
   Metro and Core providers that are closely tied.  One definition 
   needing further refinement is that of "administrative entity" in the 
   ON case. 
    
3.1.2   Inter-vendor Inter-area 
   Another example occurs when interoperability between two different 
   optical vendors is desired.  Vendors may use different protocols as 
   the primary option between their own devices, adding specialized 
   features or optimizing their performance based on their choice of 
   protocol.  Although one option is to force both vendors to adopt a 
   new common protocol another is to only require a minimum subset of 
   reachability/topology information to be shared between them. 
    
   Notes: A common model is that carriers tend to buy clusters of 
   equipment from a common vendor. For example, it is unlikely that 
   there will be a mixture of XXX, YYY, and ZZZ optical switches in the 
   same subnetwork. 
 
3.1.3   Legacy Interoperability Inter-area 
    
   A very important subcase of inter-vendor/inter-area is where some 
   optical subnetworks (read: lots of existing installations) may not 
   run a routing protocol at all, e.g., they rely strictly on EMS-based 
   topology discovery/resource management.  In this case it may be 
   necessary to establish a "route proxy" to represent the sub-network 
   and allow for interoperability with other subnetworks. Key in this 
   case is the fact that we can't get the network elements in these 
   subnetworks to run a distributed route protocol. However, we can 
   have a separate software entity with access to the appropriate 
   information, proxy routing information for this entire subnetwork.  
 
   The basic advantage here is that even though the vendor specific 
   element management system (EMS) knows the topology of its 
   subnetwork, it is better that information be exchanged automatically 
   between adjoining areas (to avoid errors) via a neighbor 
   discovery/link verification protocol such as those suggested in LMP 
   [9], OIF-UNI [10], or G.disc [11]. Now these protocols will furnish 
   basic node and port mapping information between the neighbor pairs 
   but will need to supply additional information to let us know that 
   these two elements belong to separate "vendor areas".

                         Figure 3-1: Route Proxy 
    
   Figure 3-1 shows an example of two areas with inter-connected NEs.  
   Assume that neither of these areas runs a distributed routing 
   protocol or desires to expose the details of its topology.  Instead 
   they may exchange routing proxy addresses through the neighbor 
   discovery protocol, and then exchange routing information between 
   route proxies. The functions of the route proxy would include: (a) 
   direct reachability exchange -- what NEs can be reached directly 
   from this area --, (b) verification of area connectedness -- how the 
   two areas are inter-connected should be understood by both -- (also 
   other areas), (c) area topology exchange and updates (possibly 
   summarized topology), and (d) topology updates concerning other 
   areas.

                 Figure 3-2: Route Proxy to Distributed Case 
    
   Figure 3-2 shows a case where one area runs a route proxy and the 
   other area runs a distributed routing protocol.  Once again a 
   neighbor discovery procedure between area border NE's could be used 
   to advertise route proxy address.   
    
   Flooding and summarization mechanisms could be applied by the route 
   proxy as if it is a switching system.  Since this is optical rather 
   than IP routing, signaling would be carried by a control channel 
   between the route proxy and the neighboring system, rather than 
   being carried over the data link. 
    
3.1.4   Inter-Layer Partitioning  
    
   In this situation the entities to be included in the route protocol 
   all fall within the same administrative domain. However, the network 
   is partitioned into sub-networks that operate at different switching 
   layers. Not all the information from one layer is necessary or 
   relevant to another layer.  Hence, in this case, the flow of routing 
   information between the layers may be asymmetric and also 
   summarized. For example, between transparent optical switches and 
   SDH/SONET path (VC) layer switches, not all the information at the 
   SONET layer is relevant to the optical layer. In addition optical 
   networks may keep a lot more physical layer information (such as the 
   properties of every optical amplifier on a WDM span) that is of no 
   use to the SONET layer.  One again this promotes scalability, but 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 12] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   also simplifies the implementation by reducing inter-layer 
   information transfer to that which is actually useful. 
    
   Let us look at the kind of information that a lower network layer 
   could make use of from its client (upper layer) subnetworks.  In 
   deciding where to place subnetwork connections in a given layer 
   network it is very useful to have a view of the current higher layer 
   traffic matrix [12] being satisfied and higher layer traffic trend 
   measurements over time.  Although we can somewhat see this in higher 
   layer resource status changes over time, this represents a link 
   level view when we really desire the trend (change in time) of the 
   traffic matrices between sites.  How this information gets 
   distributed is an open issue. Currently individual nodes in a GMPLS 
   network know only about connections that they source or sink. 
    
   Now looking the other way is initially simpler, i.e., it is easier 
   to ask: what can a higher layer use for path selection from a lower 
   layer. The first item that springs into mind is diversity 
   information. Note from earlier discussions that there may be 
   multiple layers of diversity information. For example in setting up 
   a SONET STS-1 path we can talk about SONET line layer diversity but 
   also about WDM fiber diversity. Other types of information maybe 
   useful to share but may be very layer specific. 
    
    
    
3.2 Classical Inter-Domain (Inter-Carrier)  
    
   In this case we are talking about dealing with outside entities, 
   i.e., between service providers.  There may be a range of levels of 
   trust here; for example there might be some level of trust between 
   two providers that have formed a marketing alliance or have some 
   other form of business relationship. In general, however, trust can 
   not be assumed. In this case, all the concerns of revealing too much 
   information about one's network come into play.  However, not 
   revealing enough, say about diversity capabilities may also lead 
   customers elsewhere. Also there are some other security issues not 
   seen before. For example, in route distribution one carrier might 
   not be inclined to pass on routing information that could point the 
   way to competitive alternatives. This impacts the methods for route 
   updates, etc. 
 
   With the interest in bandwidth trading [13] we can also look at this 
   as an advertisement of network connectivity and capability with of 
   course any "warts" covered up. This would include reliance on other 
   carrier for fibers or lambdas.  Also a fair amount of details such 
   as "unused capacity" would not be advertised since this maybe 
   financially sensitive information. 
    
   Private line pricing today is based primarily on the service itself 
   (bandwidth, end-points, etc.) and the holding time, and there is no 
   reason to expect that this will change. When multiple service 
   providers are involved the algorithm for dividing up the revenue 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 13] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   stream (which can be quite large even for a single connection) must 
   be explicit by connect time. This could be done off-line or could be 
   done at connect time. In either case, the entity or entities doing 
   the routing will need to take provider pricing structures into 
   account whenever there is a choice between providers that needs to 
   be made. The routing logic could do this explicitly if the prices 
   are captured in the advertised metrics or some other advertised 
   data; alternatively it could be done by some sort of policy control, 
   as it is today by BGP. 
    
   The essence of bandwidth trading is the existence of competing price 
   structures that are known to the entity deciding which competitor to 
   use.  It is possible to create plausible bandwidth trading scenarios 
   involving the UNI, the NNI, or both. If the NNI is involved, these 
   price structures will need to be established across it. The 
   situation is further complicated by the fact that bandwidth trading 
   could be realized using any one of a number of business models, each 
   with its own information requirements. To give two examples: If an 
   auction model were used the buyer might repeatedly broadcast the 
   lowest bid received to date and solicit lower bids from the 
   competing providers. On the other hand, if there were a more formal 
   market the providers might post their asking prices in some public 
   fashion and a buyer would be matched by some third party with the 
   lowest offer. 
     
   In the inter-carrier case notions of hierarchy seem rather 
   sensitive, i.e., he who controls the summarization and advertisement 
   may have an undue advantage over competitors.  In addition, a 
   "bandwidth aggregator" may want to advertise capabilities that he 
   has put together via deals with multiple carriers... 
    
   Notes: We can attempt to extend the SRLG concept to links between 
   ASs but we will need the two ASs to agree on the meaning and number 
   of the list of 32 bit integers that comprise the SRLG, i.e., 
   previously the SRLG concept was one of AS scope.  And this is also 
   where things get tricky since it may not be possible to distinguish 
   diverse routes based upon differing path vectors (i.e., AS number 
   traversal list).  The reason for this is due the fact that many 
   carriers "fill out" their networks by renting either dark fiber or 
   "lambdas" from a WDM system and hence although the path vectors may 
   be AS diverse they may not even be fiber diverse. 
    
   Hence there is a need for sharing of diversity information or 
   constraints between ASs when setting up diverse connections across 
   multiple ASs.  This gets us somewhat into a quandary over which 
   information needs to be public and how to coordinate its 
   distribution.  In this sense geographic link information may be the 
   simplest and least contentious to get various players to disclose 
   and standardize. 
    
   Notes:  (1) The real issue is consistency between the cloud/AS’s 
   since in many cases they are sharing conduit, ROW, etc.  Getting 
   this to happen could be very problematic. It would be preferable to 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 14] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   see a diversity option that doesn’t require this. For example, 
   ensure that there is diversity within each cloud and then do 
   restoration separately within each cloud. (2)  See the definition of 
   SRLG in the Carrier Requirements – an equivalence class of links, 
   the extent of violation, and the level. (3) Flexibility in defining 
   the level of violation seems very desirable – these historically 
   have drifted in time. There are many others – eg, if the shared 
   resources are SPRING protected that’s less of a problem than 
   otherwise. 
    
   Notes: Participation in the inter-domain network carries constraints 
   on the carriers. First, in order to participate, each provider 
   network MUST be willing to advertise the destinations that are 
   reachable through his network at each entry point and advertise the 
   formats available. Without providing such information, there is 
   little motivation to participate since it is unlikely that others 
   will be able to access services of which they are not aware. Second, 
   every participating carriers MUST agree to fairly include the 
   information made available by every other carrier so that each 
   carrier has an equal opportunity to provide services. There may be 
   specific exceptions, but the carrier claiming those exceptions MUST 
   advertise the exceptions themselves. In this manner, other carriers 
   that might otherwise be aware of distant services can be prompted to 
   seek those services manually.  Note a combination of minimal 
   required information transferred with deferral to the originating 
   subnetwork along with some basic security mechanisms such as 
   integrity and non-repudiation may be useful in helping organizations 
   to "play nice". 
    
3.3 Multi-Domain Connection Control 
    
   MPLS’ loose routing capability allows one to specify a route for an 
   optical connection in terms of a sequence of optical AS numbers.  
   This, for example, is handled via RSVP-TE’s abstract node concept 
   [14]. Currently there is nothing in the GMPLS signaling 
   specification that differentiates between intra AS boundaries, i.e., 
   between two neighbor optical LSRs in the same AS, and inter AS 
   boundaries, i.e. between two neighbor optical LSRs in different ASs.  
   Note that these same notions can apply to separate routing domains 
   within an AS. There may, however, be some useful reasons for 
   differentiating these two cases: 
    
         1. Separation of signaling domains, 
         2. Separation of protection domains. 
    
   While routing protocols (used for their topology information) in the 
   optical case are not "service impacting", signaling protocols most 
   certainly are.  It is desirable to build some type of "wall" between 
   optical ASs so that faults in one that lead to "signaling storms" do 
   not get propagated to other ASs.  Note that the same motivation 
   applies for isolating other kinds of clouds, like vendors specific 
   ones. 
    
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 15] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   The natural situation where "signaling storms" would be most likely 
   to arise is during network restoration signaling, i.e., signaling to 
   recover connections during major network outages, e.g., natural 
   disasters etc. In this case it may be very advantageous to break up 
   general source reroute forms of restoration into per domain segments 
   or to start reroute at domain boundaries rather than all the way 
   back at the originating node. Note that this has the advantage of 
   reducing the need for globally consistent SRLG’s. (See earlier SRLG 
   comment.) Such a capability requires some loose coordination between 
   the local, intermediate and global protection mechanisms [15].  This 
   is typically implemented via hold off timers, i.e., one layer of 
   protection will not attempt restoration until a more fundamental 
   (local) form has been given a chance to recover the connection [15].  
    
   In other words, prevention of restoration related signaling storms 
   may require the breaking up of a large network into multiple 
   signaling (and hence routing) domains. These domains could be within

4  Multiple Layers of Routing 
 
4.1 Layers in Transport Networks  
    
   In transport networks layering is a part of the multiplex and OA&M 
   structure of the signals, playing a role in multiplexing, monitoring 
   and general link management.  Layering in the transport network is 
   defined in fairly abstract terms in [G.805] and the concepts are 
   applied to SDH in [G.803].  As explained in a recent ITU SG15 
   document (WD45 Q.14/15) not all the layers in the transport network 
   are of interest to the control plane, or to routing in particular.  
    
   Some layers may not contain active switching elements, however this 
   does not mean that information flow concerning a non-switching layer 
   is not valuable in routing. For example in [GB-WDM-SRLG] static WDM 
   layer information was used to set the SRLGs for SONET lines (i.e., 
   information passed around by a link state protocol operating at the 
   SONET line layer). It should be noted that much of the information 
   available from non-switching layers relates to performance 
   monitoring and fault management. Hence work in this area within 
   CCAMP should take into account this layered approach. 
    
   Note that this is distinct from the layer idea used in the 7-layer 
   OSI model or IP layer model. In the IP model, the term Layer means 
   that, for example, the Application Layer entity requests services 
   for delivering a message to an entity on another computer and it 
   contacts the Transport Layer service, which in turn contacts the 
   Internet Layer. Lower layers are successively contacted until an 
   end-to-end service is provided. A key concept is that the 
   Application Layer cannot (or rather should not) contact the Internet 
   Layer directly. In this model all the "layers" discussed in this 
   document would lie in the "physical layer" (from an IP perspective).

   For concreteness we first give a overview of routing at two of the 
   various layers of interest in the optical network, transparent 
   optical and SONET/SDH.  We then discuss information sharing between 
   layers in general and with the IP layer in particular.  
 
4.2 Optical Physical Layer Routing  
    
   Routing in the optical layer is in general more than just finding a 
   path that has the available wavelength. Besides possible distance 
   and cost optimization and the diversity requirements as described in 
   section 4.2, there are constraints arising from the design of new 
   software controllable network elements as well as constraints in 
   domains of transparency, i.e., all optical networks. Here, we 
   summarize the main constraints in the two categories. See reference 
   [16] for more detailed discussions. 
    
4.2.1   Reconfigurable Network Elements 
   Besides OLXCs, there are other software reconfigurable elements on 
   the horizon, specifically tunable lasers and receivers and 
   reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (OADM’s).  These 
   elements are illustrated in the following simple example, which is 
   modeled on announced Optical Transport System (OTS) products:

         Figure 4-1: An OTS With OADM's - Functional Architecture 
    
   In Fig. 4-1, the part that is on the inner side of all boxes labeled 
   "A" defines an all-optical subnetwork. Boxes labeled "A" provide 
   adaptation function that transform the incoming optical channel into 
   the physical wavelength to be transported through the subnetwork as 
   well as possible multiplexing function using either electrical or

   optical TDM. These may result in the following constraints on 
   routing: 
     - The adaptation function may force groups of input channels to be 
       delivered together to the same distant adaptation function. 
     - Only adaptation functions whose lasers/receivers are tunable to 
       compatible frequencies can be connected. 
     - The switching capability of the OADM’s may also be constrained.  
       For example: 
          o There may be some wavelengths that can not be dropped at 
            all. 
          o There may be a fixed relationship between the frequency 
            dropped and the physical port on the OADM to which it is 
            dropped. 
          o OADM physical design may put an upper bound on the number 
            of adaptation groupings dropped at any single OADM. 
    
4.2.2   Wavelength Routed All-Optical Networks 
    
   The optical networks presently being deployed may be called "opaque" 
   [17]: each link is optically isolated by transponders doing O/E/O 
   conversions. They provide regeneration with retiming and reshaping, 
   also called 3R, which eliminates transparency to bit rates and frame 
   format. These transponders are quite expensive and their lack of 
   transparency also constrains the rapid introduction of new services.  
   Thus there are strong motivators to introduce "domains of 
   transparency" - all-optical subnetworks - larger than an OTS, where 
   signal passes through the domain optically. There are two unique 
   types of constraints on routing: one that is due to limited (or no) 
   wavelength conversion, and the other that is due to physical 
   impairments. 
    
   Within an all-optical domain, "wavelength conversion" (changing the 
   wavelength of a connection) is still expensive and not yet practical 
   without an OEO conversion.  Therefore it is important to understand 
   the routing implications of limited (or no) wavelength conversion. 
   This requires us to look at what is called the "Routing and 
   Wavelength Assignment (RWA) Problem" [18]: Given one or more 
   connections that need to be established in an all-optical domain, 
   determine the routes over which each connection should be routed and 
   also assign each connection a color. If the routes are already 
   known, the problem is called the "Wavelength Assignment (WA) 
   Problem".  
    
   As domains of transparency get larger and bit rates of 10 Gb/sec and 
   higher become common physical impairments including amplifier 
   spontaneous emission (ASE), polarization mode dispersion (PMD), and 
   others may become a routing issue. We consider a single domain of 
   transparency. Additionally due to the proprietary nature of DWDM 
   transmission technology, we assume that the domain is either single 
   vendor or architected using a single coherent design philosophy, 
   particularly with regard to the management of impairments. 
   Specifically: 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 18] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
     . ASE noise which accumulates imposes a limit on the maximum 
        number of spans for the transparent segment in a lightpath, 
        which is bit rate dependent: the higher the bit rate the fewer 
        the spans.  A span refers to a segment between two optical 
        amplifiers.  
     . PMD imposes a limit on the maximum transmission distance for 
        the transparent segment that is inversely proportional to the 
        square of the bit rate of the signal. For typical installed 
        fibers the limits are 400km and 25km for bit rates of 10Gb/s 
        and 40Gb/s, respectively. With newer fibers assuming PMD 
        parameter of 0.1 ps/.km, the limits are 10000km and 625km, 
        respectively. 
     . Crosstalk and effective passband narrowing due to filtering 
        effects can be treated approximately as a constraint on the 
        maximum allowable number of OADMs/OXCs in the transparent 
        segment of the lightpath. 
     . Other impairments including chromatic dispersion, nonlinear 
        impairments are assumed to be treated at the transmission 
        system level and/or as additional system margin on OSNR 
        (optical signal to noise ratio).   
    
4.2.3   More Complex Networks 
   An optical network composed of multiple domains of transparency 
   optically isolated from each other by OEO devices (transponders) is 
   more plausible. A network composed of both "opaque" (optically 
   isolated) OLXC's and one or more all-optical "islands" isolated by 
   transponders is of particular interest because this is most likely 
   how all-optical technologies are going to be introduced. We now 
   consider the complexities raised by these alternatives. 
    
   The first requirement for routing in a multi-island network is that 
   the routing process needs to know the extent of each island. There 
   are several reasons for this: 
     . When entering or leaving an all-optical island, the 
        regeneration process cleans up the optical impairments 
        discussed. 
     . Each all-optical island may have its own bounds on each 
        impairment. 
     . The routing process needs to be sensitive to the costs 
        associated with "island-hopping". 
 
   The first-order implications for GMPLS seem to be: 
     . Information about island boundaries needs to be advertised. 
     . The routing algorithm needs to be sensitive to island 
       transitions and to the connectivity limitations and impairment 
       constraints particular to each island. 
     . The cost function used in routing must allow the balancing of 
       transponder costs, OXC and OADM costs, and line haul costs 
       across the entire routing domain. 
    
   Several distributed approaches to multi-island routing seem worth 
   investigating:

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
     . Advertise the internal topology and constraints of each island 
        globally; let the ingress node compute an end-to-end strict 
        explicit route sensitive to all constraints and wavelength 
        availabilities. In this approach the routing algorithm used by 
        the ingress node must be able to deal with the details of 
        routing within each island. 
     . Have the EMS or control plane of each island determine and 
        advertise the connectivity between its boundary nodes together 
        with additional information such as costs and the bit rates and 
        formats supported. As the spare capacity situation changes, 
        updates would be advertised. In this approach impairment 
        constraints are handled within each island and impairment-
        related parameters need not be advertised outside of the 
        island. The ingress node would then do a loose explicit route 
        and leave the routing and wavelength selection within each 
        island to the island. 
     . Have the ingress node send out probes or queries to nearby 
        gateway nodes or to an NMS to get routing guidance. 
    
4.3 SDH/SONET layer Routing  
    
   An overview of link state intra domain routing applied to SONET/SDH 
   networks can be found in reference [3]. We will give a very short 
   review here with an emphasis on the multiple-layer aspects. 
     
4.3.1   Switching Capabilities 
    
   The main switching capabilities that characterize a SONET/SDH end 
   system and thus get advertised into the link state route protocol 
   are: the switching granularity, supported forms of concatenation, 
   and the level of transparency. 
    
4.3.2   Switching Granularity 
    
   The signals switched in SONET/SDH can be divided in to two main 
   categories: lower order signals and higher order signals as shown in 
   Table 2. 
    
   Table 2.  SDH/SONET switched signal groupings. 
    
         Signal Type    SDH                       SONET 
    
         Lower Order    VC-11, VC-12, VC-2        VT-1.5 SPE, VT-2 SPE, 
                                                  VT-3 SPE, VT-6 SPE 
    
         Higher         VC-3, VC-4                STS-1 SPE 
         Order          VC-4-Xc (concatenated)    STS-Nc SPE (concat.) 
    
   For transport across a SONET network the lower order signals must be 
   multiplexed into a non-concatenated higher order signal. Hence a 
   higher order "connection" is required between "lower order" switches 
   before the lower order traffic can be switched. 
    
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 20] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   A network element capable of switching one type of lower order 
   signal is not required to support switching of all the other types 
   of lower order signals and a similar notion holds true for the 
   higher order signals.  Hence there is a need to distribute the 
   switching capabilities (granularity) of a node on one end of a link. 
    
4.3.3   Protection 
    
   SONET and SDH networks offer a variety of protection options at both 
   the SONET line (SDH multiplex section) and SONET/SDH path level.  
   This means that we can protection mechanisms directly for the lower 
   order or higher order switching layers defined in the previous 
   section, i.e., the SONET line (SDH MS) techniques protect the higher 
   order signals on a per line layer link basis.  While the path layer 
   protection mechanisms protect either the lower order signals on a 
   per higher order link basis or the higher order signals on a 
   subnetwork connection basis. 
    
   Standardized SONET line level protection techniques include Linear 
   1+1 and Linear 1:N automatic protection switching (APS) and both 
   two-fiber and four-fiber bi-directional line switched rings (BLSRs). 
   At the path layer, SONET offers uni-directional path switched ring 
   protection. Both ring and 1:N line protection also allow for "extra 
   traffic" to be carried over the protection line when that line is 
   not being used, i.e., when it is not carrying traffic for a failed 
   working line. These protection methods are summarized in Table 5.

       ring)                              networks. 
    
    
   It may be desirable to route some connections over lines that 
   support protection of a given type, while others may be routed over 
   unprotected lines, or as "extra traffic" over protection lines. Also 
   to assist in the configuration of these various protection methods 
   it can be extremely valuable to advertise the link protection 
   attributes in the route protocol.  For example suppose that a 1:N 
   protection group is being configured via two nodes.  One must make 
   sure that the lines are "numbered the same" with respect to both end 
   of the connection or else the APS (K1/K2 byte) protocol will not 
   operate correctly. 
    
4.3.4   Available Capacity Advertisement 
    
   Internal to each SDH/SONET LSR interface, a table is maintained 
   indicating each signal allocated in the multiplex structure. This 
   internal table is the most complete and accurate view of the link 
   usage and available capacity. 
    
   This information needs to be advertised in some way to all the other 
   SONET/SDH switches/multiplexers in the same domain for use in path 
   computation. There is a trade off to be reached concerning: the 
   amount of detail in the available capacity information to be 
   reported via a link state routing protocol, the frequency or 
   conditions under which this information is updated, the percentage 
   of connection establishments that are unsuccessful on their first 
   attempt, the extent to which network resources can be optimized.  
   There are different levels of summarization that are being 
   considered today for the available capacity information. At one 
   extreme all signals that are allocated on an interface could be 
   advertised, or on the other extreme, a single aggregated value of 
   the available bandwidth could be advertised. It makes the most sense 
   to keep at least the bandwidth reporting for the lower order and 
   higher order signals separate since these are working at different 
   layers in the multiplex hierarchy. 
    
   Consider first the relatively simple structure of SONET and its most    
   common current and planned usage. DS1s and DS3s are the signals most    
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 22] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   often carried within a SONET STS-1.  Either a single DS3 occupies    
   the STS-1 or up to 28 DS1s (4 each within the 7 VT groups) are    
   carried within the STS-1. With a reasonable VT1.5 placement    
   algorithm within each node it may be possible to just report on    
   aggregate bandwidth usage in terms of number of whole STS-1s    
   (dedicated to DS3s) used and the number of STS-1s dedicated to    
   carrying DS1s allocated for this purpose.  This way a network    
   optimization program could try to determine the optimal placement of    
   DS3s and DS1s to minimize wasted bandwidth due to half-empty STS-1s    
   at various places within the transport network.  
    
   Similarly consider the set of super rate SONET signals (STS-Nc). If 
   the links between the two switches support flexible concatenation 
   then the reporting is particularly straightforward since any of the 
   STS-1s within an STS-M can be used to comprise the transported STS- 
   Nc.  However, if only standard concatenation is supported then 
   reporting gets trickier since there are constraints on where the 
   STS-1s can be placed.  
 
    
4.4 Layer Integration  
 
   As previously discussed, there are multiple layers of signals 
   included in what in the IP model one would call the Physical Layer. 
   One could separate the layers by creating sublayers in the Physical 
   Layer.  For example, sublayers in the Physical Layer might be, top 
   to bottom: LOVCs, HOVCs, and Lambdas. If a system supports only one 
   of the three, then isolation of the sublayers is a given; it's 
   geographical. But there are systems which will support more than one 
   physical sublayer, therefore, it is necessary to establish whether 
   or not there is a need to isolate the sublayers in the same manner. 
   Or put another way is there a reason to "integrate" the sublayers 
   for the purposes of routing (topology dissemination). 
    
   If they are isolated, then there will be separate topological models 
   for each sublayer: one mesh for the LOVC, one for the HOVC, one for 
   the Lambda, and possibly others. The appropriate way to access a 
   sublayer is via the use of sublayer SAPs (service access points). 
   For example, in this way, one may find that use of Lambdas is more 
   efficient because each sublayer can assess the availability of 
   services at its own layer before searching for coarser-granularity 
   services. On the other hand, the control plane must accommodate 
   three separate routing protocols, or at least three separate 
   instances of the same routing protocol, all operating at both intra 
   and inter-domain level.  
    
   Section 4.4.2, herein, states "For transport across a SONET network, 
   the lower order signals must be multiplexed into a non-concatenated 
   higher order signal." Given that this is true, LOVCs are not routed 
   independently, but only as tributaries of HOVCs. In addition in the 
   SDH hierarchy there is a signal, VC3, that can be treated 
   (multiplexed) as either a LOVC or a HOVC.  With this tight and

   somewhat confused coupling of these layers it may beneficial to 
   sometimes combine them into the same route protocol instance.  
    
   Use of the terms LOVC and HOVC infers that all of the services to be 
   supported by inter-domain routing are those formally associated with 
   the terms in SONET and SDH standards. However, among the optical 
   systems emerging in today’s market are rate and format independent 
   systems, which claim to offer services that do not rely on SONET/SDH 
   framing. Their intent is to support Ethernet, ATM, and OTN framing 
   without the need for electronics specifically targeted at the signal 
   of interest. The question arises whether or not to include these 
   "clear channel" services as a separate sublayer of the Physical 
   Layer.  
    
   The alternative to separate routing protocols per sublayer is the 
   original notion behind GMPLS routing and the forwarding adjaciency 
   concept [19]. Rather than separating the route protocols into 
   separate layers (or sublayers) with distinct topologies, each ONE 
   would advertise the services it can provide, along with its topology 
   information. For example, a ONE (optical network element) might 
   advertise that it carries a route to node A with STS-N service and 
   clear-channel lambda service and carries multiple routes to node B 
   with STS-N service. It might, alternatively, advertise its entire 
   network with summarized link capacity information for every included 
   link. Neighboring carriers would, implicitly, be allowed to 
   summarize that information for internal advertisement via its IGP. 
   Further consideration could be given to a query service, where a 
   carrier advertises the geographical area it serves without detailed 
   reachability or capacity information. A second carrier desiring 
   service could query the first carrier as to reachability for a 
   specific destination, and the first carrier would respond with 
   availability and capacity information. 
 
   Integrating multiple layers into the same routing protocol instance 
   leaves us fewer routing protocols to manage. The downside of this is 
   that more information must be exchanged via this routing protocol 
   and more network elements participate in this single instance of the 
   routing protocol which can lead to scalability concerns. If the 
   equipment working on the different sublayers comes from different 
   vendors there would be little incentive to integrate multiple layers 
   into the routing protocol for a single layer product.   
   Regardless of whether multiple layers are integrated into the same 
   routing protocol instance it can be very useful to share information 
   between layers as illustrated by the following examples: 
    
    
        o Drop side links between layers: Capabilities of the links 
          that are between the (client and server) layers need to be 
          propagated into the routing protocol. 
        o Summarize link capabilities: Summarizing the server layer 
          capabilities in the client layer will reduce the amount of 
          information required for multi-layer constraint based path 
          computation.

        o Send only that are required: Sending only the capabilities 
          that are useful in the constraint path computation in the 
          client layer. 
    
    
4.5 Interaction with IP Layer Routing  
    
   The applicability of IP-based routing protocols has, over the years, 
   been constantly expanded to increasingly more circuit-oriented 
   layers. The community began with pure datagram routing, gradually 
   expanded to cover virtual-circuit switched packet routing (for e.g., 
   MPLS), and is finally looking at the application of routing 
   protocols to real circuit switching, e.g. the optical layer. 
    
   However, as pointed out earlier in this document, it is not clear 
   that the different layers should necessarily share the same instance 
   of the IP routing protocols. Indeed, there may be significant 
   reasons for not doing so. For example, IP-layer reachability 
   information is not particularly useful for the optical layer, so it 
   seems an overkill to burden the optical equipment with storing and 
   distributing that information. (It is an extra expense on memory and 
   processing for information that the optical layer does not really 
   care about, so there is little incentive for a vendor to want to do 
   so.) Likewise, information on physical plant (fibers, conduits, 
   ducts) diversity, which is crucial at the optical transport layer, 
   is very unlikely to be used directly by the IP layer. So, it would 
   be quite wasteful of resources to burden the IP layer routing with 
   distributing and manipulating this information. 
    
   Thus, the extent of interaction or integration with IP layer routing 
   (if any) requires careful consideration. 
    
5  Existing Routing Protocol Applicability 
    
   Here we look at the applicability of OSPF, PNNI and BGP to various 
   aspects of the general optical inter domain routing problem.  All 
   protocols provide reachability information. The questions to be 
   investigated are how they deal with partitioning the network, 
   diverse routing, summarized/abstracted topology information sharing, 
   and suitability for the inter-carrier environment. 
    
5.1 OSPF Applicability  
    
   [THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION] 
   Notes: Interested here in OSPF areas their capabilities and 
   limitations. 
    
   For example in OSPF [RFC2328, section 3] no topology information is 
   shared between areas only summarized address information. A key 
   property of OSPF areas is that all areas must be attached to the 
   "backbone" area in some manner, either via physical links or virtual 
   links.  

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 25] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   How much topology information gets lost in the virtual link case? An 
   ABR connected to the backbone via a virtual link will know the 
   topology of the backbone (via virtual link) and the (at least) two 
   non-backbone areas that it is connected to. By being connected to 
   the back bone we find out reachability.  Each ABR advertises its 
   directly attached areas into the backbone. Note that it doesn't seem 
   possible to discern the area structure from the summary LSAs. Notes: 
   we could obtain via a backbone router on the network info to 
   identify all the ABRs [Check this] then go to each of these ABRs get 
   their link state route tables and put together a complete picture of 
   the network.  It  would, however be nice to get updates from the 
   areas as to major changes (i.e., bandwidth info) without polling. 
    
   Notes: draft-kompella-mpls-multiarea-te-01.txt has some analysis. 
   They look at the issue of who knows what, the fact that ABRs know 
   about topology of all areas that they connect, they use "crankback" 
   like methods to pick another ABR in case of failure.  They don't hit 
   the diversity case.  
    
5.2 PNNI Routing 
 
   The routing portion of ATM's Private Network-to-Network Interface 
   (PNNI) [20] is a link state routing protocol like OSPF and IS-IS 
   with a general inter-area hierarchy capability. We explore the 
   characteristics of PNNI here because, as a link-state protocol, it 
   was designed at the outset with several features that are attractive 
   in a connection-oriented network: 
        1. Distribution of topology information, 
        2. Distribution of resource (bandwidth) status information, 
        3. Establishment of hierarchical groups, 
    
   In addition, PNNI routing was designed to work with PNNI signaling 
   which is very similar in functionality to the traffic engineering 
   capable forms of GMPLS (MPLS) signaling (label distribution 
   protocols). In particular PNNI signaling is based upon: 
        1. Source routing (exact and loose forms), 
        2. Crankback and Alternate Routing. 
   A brief summary of PNNI routing capabilities and a brief assessment 
   of its applicability to the Optical Inter-Domain Routing problem 
   follows. 
    
5.2.1   PNNI overview 
    
   PNNI routing supports the provisioning of the network into a 
   hierarchy that can include up to 104 levels. The PNNI Hierarchy 
   starts at the lowest level where the lowest-level nodes are 
   organized into "peer groups", a generalization of OSPF's area 
   concept. A peer group is a collection of nodes, each of which 
   exchanges information with other members of the group so that all 
   members of the group maintain an identical view of the group. Each 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 26] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   peer group is identified with a "peer group identifier," which is 
   provisioned when the network is configured. Each peer group elects a 
   "peer group leader" through a system of provisioned priorities and 
   arbitrated using the NSAP addresses of the nodes. This system is 
   applied at each successively higher layer in the hierarchy. The peer 
   group leader is also known as the "logical group node" and it 
   represents the peer group in the next higher layer in the hierarchy. 
    
   Information is fed in both the upward and downward directions in the 
   hierarchy. The logical group node feeds reachability and topology 
   aggregation information upward. Reachability information includes a 
   summary of the addresses that are reachable through this peer group. 
   Topology aggregation includes the information needed to route into 
   and through this peer group. In the downward direction, the logical 
   group node feeds information that gives the lower-level nodes 
   knowledge of how to route to all destinations reachable within the 
   routing domain. Completion of the hierarchy is achieved by creating 
   ever higher levels until the entire network is encompassed in a 
   single peer group. 
    
   As discussed above, topology and reachability information is 
   distributed throughout the network so that the every switch in the 
   domain maintains a consistent picture of the network. Information is 
   exchanged among the peer groups and between each peer group and the 
   group immediately above it in the hierarchy. At the lowest level in 
   the hierarchy, the nodes exchange Hello packets with immediate 
   neighbors to determine local state information. Each node bundles 
   the information it collects from Hellos into a "PNNI Topology State 
   Element" (PTSE) and the PTSEs are reliably flooded throughout the 
   peer group. The flooding continues until every node in the domain 
   has a consistent picture of the network. As previously discussed, 
   PTSEs are fed downward to the next lower level in the hierarchy. 
    
   Nodes actively taking part in PNNI routing are addressed using ATM 
   End System Addresses, which are modeled after NSAP addresses. PNNI 
   router addresses include a prefix that specifies the Peer Group 
   Identifier. Peer group identifiers are encoded using 14 octets: a 1 
   octet level indicator followed by 13 octets of identifier 
   information. The value of the level indicator must be between 0 and 
   104. The value set in the identifier information field must be 
   encoded with the 104-n right-most bits set to zero, where n is the 
   level. The identifier information is formatted left-to-right in a 
   hierarchical manner. The structure of the hierarchy is defined by 
   the peer group identifiers. Address assignment has a hierarchy that, 
   for proper scaling, should generally correspond to the topological 
   hierarchy. This will allow address summarization where an address 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 27] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   prefix represents reachability to all addresses that begin with the 
   stated prefix. When summarizing reachable addresses for 
   advertisement, addresses that are exceptions are described by longer 
   prefixes. 
    
   PNNI signaling works with the topology and resource status 
   information provided by PNNI routing via source route control. The 
   precise name for this in PNNI signaling is a Designated Transit 
   Lists (DTL), where the ingress switch decides the entire path across 
   the PNNI routing domain. The DTL consists of a list of Node IDs 
   and/or Port IDs traversing the peer group. To get across specific 
   peer groups, the first node (a border node) in each peer group 
   selects the specific path, in detail, across the local peer group. 
   Since the ingress node uses currently available information, there 
   are occasions when a path being processed according to a DTL may be 
   blocked along the route. When a route cannot be processed according 
   to the DTL, it is "cranked back" to the creator of that DTL, with an 
   indication of a problem. This node may choose an alternate path for 
   the route or it may crank the route back further. 
    
5.2.2   PNNI Optical Applicability 
    
   As we saw PNNI routing has a general hierarchy and was designed to 
   work with an explicit source routed signaling protocol. This 
   resulted in a couple of key properties. First, no specific path 
   computation is tied with PNNI routing or even included within the 
   specification. Second, due to the fact that the routes must be 
   computed outside of the routing protocol, even as we move up the 
   peer group (generalized area) hierarchy, the link state nature of 
   the protocol is preserved. In particular we still get topology and 
   resource status information, albeit at an increasingly coarser 
   level. Hence, information needed for diverse routing is still 
   available even at the inter-area (higher order peer group) level.  
    
   Other items to note are the automated set up of control channels 
   between peer group leaders, i.e., logical nodes at the next layer up 
   in the hierarchy and a process where peer group leaders can be 
   changed (due to failures or maintenance). Peer groups at a common 
   hierarchical level can be connected arbitrarily; the notion of Area 
   0 does not apply in PNNI as it does in OSPF. 
 
   PNNI was not originally intended for use in an inter-carrier 
   environment. It was originally intended for use in a private ATM 
   network in a network-to-network or a node-to-network capacity. While 
   PNNI provides summarization, it does not provide the means to "hide" 
   the topology of a peer group. In addition, its topology 
   summarization capability is limited to the "complex node

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   representation" which includes "exceptions". While this hub-spoke 
   plus extensions is a bit better than an unstructured "blob" model, 
   in the inter-carrier case we may wish to give more information than 
   a single complex node but not have any of the "lower peer groups" 
   actually share information.  A typical example maybe the 
   representation of the network in terms of city pairs visited and 
   services offered, but not detailed link information (number of links 
   between city pairs or available capacity). 
    
5.3 BGP Applicability 
 
   The most basic functionality that we need to know about is which end 
   systems are attached to each area or domain.  In addition, we need 
   at least one method for reaching each domain or area if we are to 
   set up an optical circuit. 
    
5.3.1   Pick One! (route that is) 
    
   With datagram routing we need to pick one route to a destination and 
   make sure this choice is consistent throughout the AS.  In 
   particular BGP specifically reduces the number of choices according 
   to the following rule [21]: 
    
        Fundamental to BGP is the rule that an AS advertises to its 
        neighboring AS's only those routes that it uses. This rule 
        reflects the "hop-by-hop" routing paradigm generally used by 
        the current Internet. 
    
   In the optical circuits case we are not using a "hop-by-hop" routing 
   paradigm.  Hence it seems that BGP constrains our knowledge of 
   diverse routes in the optical case.  This hits a major difference in 
   use between the optical and IP datagram forwarding cases.  In the 
   optical case we are really interested in topology information that 
   allows an optical connection path to be computed based on whatever 
   criteria is desired for that connection.  In the IP datagram case we 
   are interested in a consistent set of routes for use in hop-by-hop 
   forwarding.  Hence the optical case has tended to favor link state 
   protocols since they furnish raw topology information that can be 
   used in computing routes as opposed to distance vector protocols 
   whose output is a set of routes (without necessarily providing 
   complete topology information). 
    
5.3.2   Reachability: Via Optical BGP like functionality 
    
   BGP is "the" reachability protocol.  The Update message contains a 
   path (AS_PATH) that furnished at least one possible route to reach 
   the destinations summarized (via prefixes) in the Network Layer 
   Reachability Information (NRLI) field.  Note that the NEXT_HOP 
   attribute can be used in terms of the next optical hop (rather than 
   IP hop).  Hence as it stands BGP can be used for arbitrary optical 
   reachability. The BGP sessions are set up via the IPCC addresses (IP 
   routable) but the information exchanged pertains to the optical 
   network not the IP control channel network. 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 29] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
    
   One of the first issues that arises in such an approach is that not 
   all optical end systems are the same, i.e., they support different 
   types of signals (TDM, lambdas, etc...). It has been suggested that 
   the BGP communities attribute [RFC1997] can be used to differentiate 
   optical equipment (end systems) with different types of termination 
   capabilities.  For example to differentiate a 10Gbps WAN interface 
   (where the data is carried in SONET OC-192 framing) from an OC-192 
   interface terminating an STS-192c SONET signal (carrying POS or 
   other types of payload such as GFP).  This can also be used to 
   differentiate the packet switch capable systems from the non-packet 
   switch (hasn't Kireeti or Yakov written something on this with MPLS 
   and BGP?) 
    
   Also can we use the communities attribute to indicate the path is 
   also compatible with the end systems capabilities.  What about an 
   STS-3c granularity end system, would we want to indicate this via a 
   communities attribute of some value and then have the AS_PATH 
   attribute be a valid AS_PATH along switches of STS-3c granularity. 
   Or consider the STS-1 granularity case. 
    
   Do we have a forwarding adjacency concept defined yet in the inter-
   domain case?  For example a DWDM lambda connecting two SONET LTE 
   boxes.  Or an OEO-PXC-OEO type of switch connecting two SONET LTEs. 
    
   To promote optical interworking a common set of attributes and their 
   meanings could be defined.  [This seems like a good project. But how 
   much are communities attributes used? And how is their meaning 
   shared between ASs?] 
     
5.3.3   Integrated with IP BGP? 
   Given the fairly modest initial demands of the emerging routing 
   controlled optical network on a BGP implementation and its 
   management, it is reasonable to ask if there is any benefit to 
   integrate this optical layer routing information with the IP layer 
   routing information?  An optical subnetwork using the communities 
   attributes to differentiate optical equipment from IP equipment and 
   various types of optical equipment would just filter out all 
   communities not of interest (right?).  And hence the IP/Optical BGP 
   integration would stop there?  There isn't too much written on using 
   communities attribute besides [RFC1998]? 
     
5.3.4   Policy Mechanisms  
 
   BGP-4 [22] provides a number of policy mechanisms that relate to how 
   routing information is used and disseminated. In particular the E-
   BGP border router model keeps distinct the routing information 
   received from each of a border routers autonomous systems external 
   peers (Adj-RIBs-In -- Adjacent Routing Information Base In), the 
   routing information that the Autonomous System (AS) itself is using 
   (Loc-RIB -- Local Routing Information Base), and the routing 
   information that the AS forwards onto its external peers (Adj-RIBs-
   Out -- Adjacent Routing Information Base Out).  Via this model one 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 30] 

                  draft-bernstein-optical-bgp-01.txt         July 2001 
 
 
   can develop policies with regards to which routes get chosen for use 
   in the AS, i.e., which routes from the Adj-RIBs-In are chosen to 
   populate the Loc-RIB. One also develops policies concerning what 
   routing information gets advertised to external peers, i.e., which 
   routes from Loc-RIB gets exported to each of the Adj-RIBs-Out. 
    
   The choice of which routes get imported for local routes generally 
   is concerned with the "quality" of those advertising the routes 
   since not too much else is known (besides the AS path vector). In 
   deciding which routes to advertise to external peers "transit 
   policies", i.e., whose traffic is allowed to transit this AS is the 
   prime consideration.  
    
   In the MPLS and in particular the explicitly routed optical case we 
   have a very strong additional policy mechanism, that of connection 
   admission control (CAC). Although an optical AS probably shouldn’t 
   advertise transit capabilities that it doesn’t wish to support, CAC 
   during connection establishment will be the final arbiter of any 
   transit policy.  In addition, some areas that are being addressed by 
   policies in the IP datagram case such as load balancing are much 
   easier to implement via CAC and/or explicit routing.  
    
   Notes: Seems like a key choice is when policies are applied. One 
   choice is CAC – do it at connection establishment. This seems to 
   force crankback however: If a request goes thru multiple AS’s A->B-
   >C-> … and C doesn’t do business with A, for example. Or with 2 
   domains A, B B might not want to let A use up last slot to some 
   destination. This suggests that at least in this case policy could 
   be applied by updated advertisements; if B decides it doesn’t want 
   any external AS using some particular link it advertises a changed 
   connectivity or metric. 
    
6  Conclusion 
    
   This draft highlighted some of the considerations for an inter-
   domain route protocol for use in optical internetworking.  The main  
   differences between optical routing and datagram routing were 
   highlighted.  Additional requirements to be addressed in an optical 
   inter-domain route protocol were discussed and several applications 
   of inter-domain routing were highlighted.  A summary of optical 
   sublayer specific routing information was furnished for both the 
   transparent optical sublayer and the SONET/SDH sublayer.  Finally a 
   review of the applicability of several existing route protocols to 
   the optical inter-domain route problem was given.
