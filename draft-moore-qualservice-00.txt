1. Abstract

   This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications
   that do not have resource requirements that are readily quantifiable
   per the standard Intserv token-bucket model (qualitative
   applications). We introduce the 'qualitative' service-type. This
   service-type can be used in conjunction with RSVP signaling to
   manage the allocation of network resources to traffic originating
   from qualitative applications. This mode of RSVP usage is
   particularly applicable to networks that combine differentiated
   service (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP signaling [intdiff].

2. Motivation

   Using standard RSVP/Intserv signaling, applications running on hosts
   issue requests for network resources by communicating the following
   information to network devices:

                    draft-moore-qualservice-00.txt          June, 1999


   1. A requested service level (Guaranteed or Controlled Load).
   2. The quantity of resources required at that service level.
   3. Classification information by which the network can recognize
      specific traffic (filterspec).
   4. Policy/identity information indicating the user and/or the
      application for which resources are required.

   In response, standard RSVP aware network nodes choose to admit or
   deny a resource request. The decision is based on the availability
   of resources along the relevant path and on policies. Policies
   define the resources that may be granted to specific users and/or
   applications. When a resource request is admitted, network nodes
   install classifiers that are used to recognize the admitted traffic
   and policers that are used to assure that the traffic remains within
   the limits of the resources requested.

   Standard RSVP/Intserv is not suitable for qualitative applications
   because these applications are unable to quantify the resources they
   require from the network. Since the required resources cannot be
   quantified, network nodes cannot determine whether sufficient
   resources exist to accommodate an application's traffic and standard
   Intserv style admission control cannot be applied.

   Diff-serv QoS mechanisms are better suited for qualitative
   applications. Nodes in a diff-serv network are typically provisioned
   to classify arriving packets to some small number of behaviour
   aggregates (BAs) [diffarch]. Treatment is applied on a per-BA basis.
   This provisioning tends to be 'open-loop' with respect to end-user
   traffic flows in the sense that there is no signaling between hosts
   and the network. Instead, the network administrator uses a
   combination of heuristics, measurement and experience to provision
   the network devices to handle aggregated traffic, with no
   deterministic knowledge of the volume of traffic that will arrive at
   any specific node.

   In applying diff-serv mechanisms to manage qualitative traffic,
   network administrators are faced with two challenges:

   1. Provisioning - network administrators need to anticipate the
      volume of traffic likely to arrive at each network node for each
      diff-serv BA. If the volume of traffic arriving is likely to
      exceed the capacity available for the BA claimed, the network
      administrator has the choice of increasing the capacity for the
      BA, reducing the volume of traffic claiming the BA, or
      compromising service to all traffic arriving for the BA.
   2. Classification - diff-serv nodes classify traffic to user and/or
      application, based on the diff-serv codepoint (DSCP) in each
      packet's IP header or based on other fields in the packet's IP
      header (source/destination address/port and protocol). The latter
      method of classification is referred to as MF classification.
      This method of classification may be unreliable and imposes a
      management burden.

   By using RSVP signaling, the management of traffic from qualitative
   applications in diff-serv networks can be significantly facilitated.
   (Note that RSVP/diff-serv interoperability has been discussed
   previously in the context of quantitative applications and
   quantitative diff-serv services [intdiff]. This draft focuses on
   qualitative applications.)

3. Operational Overview

   In the proposed mechanism, the RSVP sender offers the new service
   type, 'Service Type Qualitative' in the ADSPEC that is included with
   the PATH message.  A new Tspec corresponding to the new service type
   is added to the SENDER_TSPEC object and may carry a limited set of
   quantifiable parameters. In addition, the RSVP sender will typically
   include with the PATH message policy objects identifying the user,
   application and sub application ID [identity, application].

   (Note that at this time, the new Tspec is defined only to carry the
   maximum packet size parameter (M), for the purpose of avoiding
   fragmentation. No other parameters are defined.)

   Network nodes receiving these PATH messages interpret the service
   type to indicate that the traffic flow is not quantifiable using the
   standard Intserv token-bucket model. Instead, network nodes manage
   the traffic flow based on any or all of the following: parameters
   which may be included in the alternate Tspec, the requesting user,
   the requesting application and the type of application sub-flow.

   This mechanism offers significant advantages over a pure diff-serv
   network. At the very least, it informs each network node which would
   be affected by the traffic flow (and which is interested in
   intercepting the signaling) of:

   1. The demand for resources in terms of number of flows of a
      particular type traversing the node.
   2. The binding between classification information and user,
      application and sub-application.

   This information is particularly useful to policy enforcement points
   and policy decision points (PEPs and PDPs).

   The network is expected to return an RSVP RESV message to the
   sender. The returned RESV message may include a DCLASS object
   [dclass]. The DCLASS object instructs the sender to mark packets on
   the corresponding flow with a specific DSCP (or set of DSCPs). This
   mechanism allows PEP/PDPs to affect the volume of traffic arriving
   at a node for any given BA. It enables the PEP/PDP to do so based on
   sophisticated policies.

   Note that by providing a set of DSCPs rather than a single DSCP, the
   network enables the host to designate certain packets as lower
   priority than other packets on the same flow. The specific usage of

   a set of DSCPs is beyond the scope of this draft and is discussed
   further in [dclass].

3.1 Operational Notes

3.1.1 Scalability Issues

   In any network in which per-flow signaling is used, it is wise to
   consider scalability concerns. Signaling for qualitative
   applications (in addition to quantitative applications) will
   increase the amount of signaling traffic in the network. However,
   RSVP signaling does not, in general, generate a significant amount
   of traffic relative to the actual data traffic associated with the
   session.

   Perhaps of more concern is the impact on processing resources at
   network nodes that process the signaling messages. When considering
   this issue, it's important to point out that it is not necessary to
   process the signaling messages at each network node. In fact, the
   combination of RSVP signaling with diff-serv networks may afford
   significant benefits even when the RSVP messages are processed only
   at certain key nodes (such as boundaries between network domains,
   first-hop routers, PEPs or any subset of these). Individual nodes
   should be enabled or disabled for RSVP processing at the discretion
   of the network administrator. See [intdiff] for a discussion of the
   impact of RSVP signaling on diff-serv networks.

   In any case, per-flow state is not necessarily required, even in
   nodes that apply per-flow processing.

3.1.2 Policy Enforcement in Legacy Networks

   Network nodes that adhere to the RSVP spec should transparently pass
   the signaling messages associated with qualitative applications. As
   such, it is possible to introduce a small number of PEPs that are
   enabled for Service Type Qualitative into a legacy network and to
   realize the benefits described in this draft.

3.1.3 Quantitative Applications which Accept Qualitative Service

   This draft does not preclude applications from offering both a
   quantitative service type and Service Type Qualitative, at the same
   time. An example of such an application would be a telephony
   application that benefits from a quantitative service but is able to
   adapt to a qualitative service. By advertising its support for both,
   the application enables network policy to decide which service type
   to provide.

4. Signaling Details

4.1 ADSPEC Generation



Moore                   expires December, 1999                       4

                    draft-moore-qualservice-00.txt          June, 1999


   The RSVP sender constructs an initial RSVP ADSPEC object specifying
   Service Type Qualitative. Since there are no service specific
   parameters associated with this service type, the associated ADSPEC
   fragment is empty and contains only the header word. Network nodes
   may or may not supply valid values for bandwidth and latency general
   parameters. As such, they may use the unknown values defined in
   [RFC2216].

   The ADSPEC is added to the RSVP PATH message created at the sender.

4.2 RSVP SENDER_TSPEC Object

    An additional Tspec is defined to correspond to the qualitative
   service. If only the qualitative service type is offered in the
   ADSPEC, then this is the only Tspec included in the SENDER_TSPEC
   object. If guaranteed or controlled load services are also offered
   in the ADSPEC, then the new Tspec is appended following the standard
   Intserv token-bucket Tspec [RFC2210].

4.3 RSVP FLOWSPEC Object

   Receivers may respond to PATH messages by generating an RSVP RESV
   message including a FLOWSPEC object. The FLOWSPEC object should
   specify that it is requesting Service Type Qualitative. It is
   possible that, in the future, a specific Rspec may be defined to
   correspond to the new service type.

5. Detailed Message Formats

5.1 Standard ADSPEC Format

   A standard RSVP ADSPEC object is described in [RFC2210]. It includes
   a message header and a default general parameters fragment.
   Following the default general parameters fragment are fragments for
   each supported service type.

5.2 ADSPEC for Qualitative Service Type

   The Qualitative Service Type ADSPEC includes the message header and
   the default general parameters fragment, followed by a single
   fragment denoting Service Type Qualitative. The new fragment
   introduced for Service Type Qualitative is formatted as follows:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    6 (a)      |x| Reserved    |           0 (b)               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   a - indicates Service Type Qualitative (6).
   x - is the break-bit.
   b - indicates zero words in addition to the header.

A complete ADSPEC supporting only Service Type Qualitative is
illustrated below:

   (r) - Length (0) of per-service data not including header word.

   Note that the standard rules for parsing ADSPEC service fragments
   ensure that the ADSPEC will not be rejected by legacy network
   elements. Specifically, these rules state that a network element
   encountering a per-service data header which it does not understand
   should set bit 23 (the break-bit) to indicate that the service is
   not supported and should use the length field from the header to
   skip over the rest of the fragment.

   Also note that it is likely that it will not be possible for hosts
   or network nodes to generate meaningful values for words 5 and/or 7
   (bandwidth estimates and path latency), due to the qualitative
   nature of the service. In this case, the unknown values from
   [RFC2216] should be used.

5.3 SENDER_TSPEC Object Format

   The following Tspec is defined to correspond to the qualitative
   service type:

     31            24 23           16 15            8 7
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   1 |   6 (a)       |0|  Reserved   |             2 (b)             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   2 | 128 (c)       |    0 (d)      |             1 (e)             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   3 | Maximum Packet Size [M] (32-bit integer)                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Word 1: Service header
   (a) - Service number 6 (Service Type Qualitative)
   (b) - Length of per-service data, 2 words not including per-service
   header

   Word 2-3: Parameter
   (c) - Parameter ID, parameter 128 (Qualitative Service TSpec)
   (d) - Parameter 128 flags (none set)
   (e) - Parameter 128 length, 1 words not including parameter header

   Note that the illustration above does not include the standard RSVP
   SENDER_TSPEC object header, nor does it include the sub-object
   header (which indicates the message format version number and
   length), defined in RFC 2205 and RFC 2210, respectively.

   In the case that only Service Type Qualitative is advertised in the
   ADSPEC, the Tspec above would be appended immediately after the
   SENDER_TSPEC object header and sub-object header. In the case that
   additional service types are advertised, requiring the token bucket
   specific Tspec defined in RFC2210, the Tspec above would be appended
   following the token bucket Tspec, which would in turn follow the
   object header and sub-object header.

    (d) - Length of qualitative data, 2 words not including per-service

5.5 DCLASS Object Format

   DCLASS objects may be included in RESV messages. For details
   regarding the DCLASS object format, see [dclass].

   The message formatting and usage rules described in this note raise
   no new security issues beyond standard RSVP.
