Internet-Draft          New NAS-Port-Type Values              March 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a set of new values for the NAS-Port-Type
   Attribute [RFC2865].  [RFC3575] states that "Certain attributes (for
   example, NAS-Port-Type) in RADIUS define a list of values to
   correspond with various meanings.  There can be 4 billion (2^32)
   values for each attribute.  Additional values can be allocated by the
   Designated Expert."

   This document is intended to act as  a request for allocation of the
   designated numbers by IANA in the appropriate registry [RADTYP].

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the authors.

2.  NAS-Port-Type Values

   This document defines new values for the NAS-Port-Type Attribute.
   This specification concerns the following values:

      30	PPPoA (PPP over ATM [RFC3336])

      31	PPPoEoA (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over ATM)

      32	PPPoEoE (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over Ethernet

      33	PPPoEoVLAN (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over VLAN)

      34	PPPoEoQinQ (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over IEEE 802.1QinQ)


3.  IANA Considerations

   This section explains the criteria to be used by the IANA for
   assignment of numbers within namespaces defined within this document.
   The "Expert Review" policy is used here with the meaning defined in
   BCP 26 [RFC2434].

3.1  Attribute Values

   [RFC3575] states that "Certain attributes (for example, NAS-Port-
   Type) in RADIUS define a list of values to correspond with various
   meanings.  There can be 4 billion (2^32) values for each attribute.
   Additional values can be allocated by the Designated Expert."

   This document is intended to act as  a request for allocation of the
   numbers listed in by IANA in the appropriate registry [RADTYP].  The
   values given have already been implemented by Cisco Systems.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification neither adds to nor detracts from the security of
   the RADIUS protocol.
