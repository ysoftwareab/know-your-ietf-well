Abstract

   This specification provides an architectural framework, called IPv6
   Label Switching Architecture or 6LSA, for an end-to-end, IP-centric
   packet transmission technique that uses the IPv6 packet header Flow
   Label to establish IPv6-based label switched paths.  The label
   switched paths, called 6LSPs, provide application and user specified
   routes for speedier transport of packets and as means for quality of
   service (QoS) or other service delivery.  Through fast swapping of
   20-bit labels instead of 128-bit IPv6 address look-ups, the

   architecture also provides memory and processing savings, the latter
   through significantly reduced address fetches for the low-powered,
   handheld devices.  Although the label from the source is delivered to
   the destination unmodified, conforming to the basic tenet of the
   existing defintion of the 3-tuple flow, the intermediate network
   nodes in 6LSA are allowed to temporarily replace the original label
   with a label of local significance.  This enables 6LSA flows to be
   hop-specific although session-based and as such a unique QoS delivery
   technique for bandwidth constrained media.  6LSA also enhances
   security since disruption by man-in-the-middle attacks through label
   changes may not affect flows end-to-end but only over a single hop.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


1.  Introduction

   Several approaches have been developed over the past decade to
   provide QoS in large networks.  These include DiffServ, RSVP, MPLS,
   ATM, extensions to routing protocols and proprietary mechanisms.
   Some of these techniques can also be applied to IPv6 transport but
   not directly.  IPv6 offers strong features to enable QoS delivery,
   most significant among them are the Flow Label and the Routing Header
   extensions.

   The IPv6 Label Switching Architecture (6LSA) specified here enables
   fast switching of 20-bit labels instead of 128-bit IPv6 address
   look-ups and thereby provides memory and processing savings, the
   latter because address fetches for low-powered, handheld devices,
   which are mostly 32-bit architectures, would be four times as fast.

   This document introduces an architectural framework for the use of
   IPv6 packet header Flow Labels for setting up labeled paths of local
   significance to provide QoS for flows that cannot be provided by a
   purely routed, connectionless approach.  The 6LSA allows local label
   generation in a network node.  It also allows any associated network
   management entity to update label tables, across the network to
   reduce man-in-the-middle attacks.

   This local label generation coupled with dynamic labeling helps 6LSA
   to provide the means for mobile nodes to set up labeled paths,
   automatically and/or manually, for end-to-end QoS delivery or of any
   other service delivery.

2.  Overview

   The IPv6 label switching mechanism makes use of the 20-bit Flow Label
   in the IPv6 header to assign flow IDs which are used for labeled
   paths, also called IPv6 label switched paths (6LSPs).  The
   specification of IPv6 label is a limited variation of RFC 3697, IPv6
   Flow Label Specification [1], in which the use of Flow Label has been
   recommended for establishing different types of flows at the source
   nodes and packet classification in the intermediate nodes.  The
   proposed mechanism of IPv6 label switching broadens the scope of the
   use of Flow Labels - beyond its use for packet classification to
   packet forwarding.

   In a conventional router, the forwarding decision is independently
   made in each router as the packet travels from one router to the
   next.  In each router, the packet's header is analyzed using a
   network layer routing algorithm to find the best next-hop that is
   often the shortest distance to the next router.  Since this
   forwarding in each router is "independent" of how the previous packet

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   for the same destination was processed and forwarded, the routing is
   considered connectionless.

   As noted in RFC 3031, MPLS Architecture, e.  Rosen, et al, [2], the
   IP packet header contains significantly more information than is
   needed for the selection of the best next hop.  The process specified
   in this document provides two functions: first, grouping of packets
   of similar flow requirements into a Forwarding Equivalence Class
   (FEC), and second, forwarding all packets belonging to an FEC along
   the same path or set of paths; the latter when multiple paths are
   allowed, for example, in case of load balancing.

   In 6LSA, the FEC may be encoded in the Flow Label field as a non-zero
   value, which is also called label in this document.  The label is
   available in one of the 3 ways: (1) in the incoming packet as Flow
   Label, (2) locally generated based on certain algorithm or policy, or
   (3) distributed through a label distribution process.  The assignment
   of packet(s) to an FEC is called binding.

   Once a binding of a label to a given FEC is performed, the forwarding
   treatment of the packet may be represented through the label and is
   maintained at a minimum for the duration of the session.  The label
   may be strictly local-node based (of local significance) as also the
   processing of the packet.

   Several models for how to build and use the 6LSA labels are presented
   in this document.  The IP packet header, specifically the IPv6 packet
   header, contains more information than is needed to determine the
   next hop and to forward the packet.

   The 6LSA label can easily support the forwarding of packets belonging
   to the same FEC along a 6LSP.

   In the 6LSA, only the first packet of a flow is analyzed for FEC
   determination and label selection.  Subsequent packets of the same
   flow may not need to go through the same process of label selection
   and assignment.

   Packet forwarding is done using the Flow Label only after the label
   binding to a FEC has taken place.

   At each router, the label assigned to a packet, along with the
   packet's source and destination addresses, and other processing
   criteria are entered into a packet forwarding table.  The label is
   assigned to the lead packet of a flow, which may or may not be the
   same as first packet of the flow.  As subsequent packets arrive, the
   forwarding table is checked using the algorithms described here to
   see if there is a label for the flow.  If none exists, a label is

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   assigned to the packet and the packet is treated as a lead packet.
   If a label value exists in the forwarding table, then the packet is
   given the same forwarding treatment as the label binding indicates.

   Since the packet forwarding decision can be made based on a single
   table look up, the packet processing is fast, as per a known
   forwarding treatment, and takes place over a known path.

   The selection of a label is based on the FEC to which the label is
   bound.  What characteristics should be chosen for what FEC is an
   administrative, service or policy decision, or a combination thereof.
   Such a decision is meant to support certain service delivery
   requirements, such as those based on DSCP code points or other
   similar values encoded or configured into the Traffic Class field of
   IPv6 packet header.  This selection and encoding procedure is outside
   the scope of this specification.  Selection of FEC may be a
   configurable parameter of the router, server, host or any other
   device that implements this specification of 6LSA.

   Finally, 6LSA is applicable to any device that is capable of
   processing and forwarding IPv6 packets.  This protocol is not
   constrained by any layer 2 or layer 1 technology.

   terms used in this document.  Some of these terms are more precisely
   defined in the later sections of this document.  Most of the
   definitions mirror those provided in RFC 3031 [2] and are applied to
   the 6LSA specification as appropriate for consistency.

4.  Distinguishing Characteristics of 6LSA

   The 6LSA characteristics justify its application wherever IPv6 is
   deployed and where QoS network performance or other service delivery
   is required or where other available packet forwarding mechanisms
   cannot deliver packet performance end-to-end.  The following special
   characteristics of 6LSA are listed here in no particular order:

      o  6LSA technology offers a methodology for the use of flow label
   in the IPv6 header that provides accelerated packet forwarding and
   allows QoS and other service delivery.

      o  IP Transparency End-to-End - By being a Layer 3 protocal and by
   avoiding encapsulation (as in MPLS) or fragmentation (as in ATM) of
   IP, the 6LSA retains the IP transparency end-to-end and provides for
   peering in Layer 3.

      o  No-Extraneous-Label-Binding Option - 6LSA offers the option to
   avoid the use of any extraneous labels and may avoid the need for
   label distribution across the network

      o  No IPSec Constraints - 6LSA does not need to use Layer 4 ports
   and therefore can be used with IPSec VPNs or other IPSec-based
   services.

      o  Free of Layer 2 Overheads - Being a layer 3 packet forwarding
   solution, the 6LSA does not need a layer 2 packet fowarding mechanism
   and as such 6LSA avoids framgmentation and reassembly delays and
   associated header overhead as in the case of ATM.  It also avoids the
   need for added signaling and state machine mechanisms to provide
   ATM-like switched paths and ship-by-night capabilities.
   Additionally, being based on routing protocols (6LSRs peer in Layer
   3), 6LSA tends to avoid the potential for O(N2) and O(N3) problems.

      o  Deployment Ease - The 6LSA can be deployed over all layer 2
   protocols such as Ethernet and PPP. There is no layer 2 interface
   limitation in 6LSA.

      o  Extensive QoS Label Space - The 20-bit Flow Label in addition
   to the 8-bit Traffic Class field can provide a huge traffic
   classification space, both the fields may be used together in the
   6LSA. (This is a subject for further work and documentation.)

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


      o  Feature Visibility - All of IPv6 packet header features are
   available whlie the packet is enroute to destination so IPSec or
   similar packet encryption does not disable the delivery of QoS or
   other similar services that 6LSA can provide.

      o  Transition to 6PE - During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6,
   the latter is being deployed as network-islands surrounding IPv4/MPLS
   core.  The implementation of 6LSA in native IPv6 edge networks will
   greatly facilitate traffic engineering between the edge and the core
   by allowing 6LSA flow labels to be carried over to MPLS labels in the
   core.

      o  Security Enhancement - since 6LSA allows node-local generation
   of labels, such generation where adopted can be made totally random
   or periodically synchronized across the 6LSA domain to considerably
   enhance security.

      o  Hop Limit field - the 8-bit hop limit field in the IPv6 header
   is available for looping prevention.  There is no need to port this
   value to another field or label.

      o  No MTU Violation - since the packet size does not change
   without the use of extraneous labels, 6LSA eliminates the potential
   for MTU violations.

   To summarize, 6LSA provides a significantly efficient and powerful
   layer 3 mechanism for fowarding IP packets - with little or no added
   overhead for signaling.

5.  Routing Versus Switching of IP Traffic

   The routing of packets on the Internet has the following essential
   characteristics in addition to connectionless, non-sequential packet
   transport: 1) The paths are not dedicated virtual paths, and 2) There
   are generally no delivery or QoS guarantees - a single class of
   best-effort service is available.

   Switching of packets has the following basic characteristics: 1) The
   routing of packets is connection-oriented; the flow of packets
   typically comprises sequential packets, 2) The packets travel over
   dedicated, virtual paths which are either permanent or temporary, and
   3) Switching is generally associated with certain delivery guarantees
   and traffic classification.  The issues with switching are:

   *  There are delays caused by VC setup time across the network.

   *  There is the need for VC state maintenance.

   *  IP address to VC translation latency is always present however
   small.


6.  6LSA Basic Components and Their Attributes

   In this section, we define the basic components and their attributes
   pertaining to an IPv6.

6.1  Label

   Label is the 20-bit, fixed length Flow Label identifier in the IPv6
   header that a node in the 6LSA binds to a Forwarding Equivalency
   Class (FEC) and uses it to forward the packet.  The label thus
   represents the FEC.  In the 6LSA, the FEC indicates the forwarding
   treatment a group or class of packets (with a given label) receives.
   This label and the FEC it represents have only local (per hop)
   significance unless the attributes associated with a FEC are shared
   among multiple nodes.

   A label in an incoming packet is called an "incoming label", and that
   in an outgoing packet is called an "outgoing label".

   A label is associated with both the flow and Forwarding Equivalence
   Class (FEC).  A flow cannot be identified without a label; the
   forwarding treatment associated with a FEC may be identified by the
   value of the label.

   In this document, the nomenclature of label or Flow Label is
   variously used though the meaning is the same and while referring to
   the word label used in other technologies, such as in MPLS, the
   context of the technology is also mentioned to distinguish the
   application and meaning of the word.

6.2  Flow

   A flow is a sequence of packets sent from a particular source node to
   a particular unicast, anycast or multicast destination node for which
   the source node desires special handling by the intervening nodes.
   The nature of that special handling might be conveyed to the routers
   by a control protocol, such as the resource reservation protocol
   (RSVP), Differentiated Services Traffic Engineering (DSTE) mechanism,
   or by information within the flow's packets themselves.

   A flow is identifed by the 3-tuple of source address, destination
   address and label value in the Flow Label in 6LSA.  All packets



Chakravorty             Expires August 21, 2005                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   belonging to the same flow must be sent with the same Flow Label.
   There may be multiple active flows in the 6LSA at any given time.

   Further applicable statements are quoted here from [3] RFC 2460 for
   clarity.

   A flow label is assigned to a flow by the flow's source node.  New
   flow labels must be chosen (pseudo-)randomly and uniformly from the
   range 1 to FFFFF hex.  The purpose of the random allocation is to
   make any set of bits within the Flow Label field suitable for use as
   a hash key by routers, for looking up the state associated with the
   flow.

   If any of those packets includes a Hop-by-Hop Options header, then
   they all must be originated with the same Hop-by-Hop Options header
   contents (excluding the Next Header field of the Hop-by-Hop Options
   header).

   If any of those packets includes a Routing header, then they all must
   be originated with the same contents in all extension headers up to
   and including the Routing header (excluding the Next Header field in
   the Routing header).  The routers or destinations are permitted, but
   not required, to verify that these conditions are satisfied.  If a
   violation is detected, it should be reported to the source by an ICMP
   parameter Problem message, Code 0, pointing to the high-order octet
   of the Flow Label field (i.e., offset 1 within the IPv6 packet).

   The maximum lifetime of any flow-handling state established along a
   flow's path must be specified as part of the description of the
   state-establishment mechanism, e.g., the resource reservation
   protocol or the flow-setup hop-by-hop option.  A source must not
   re-use a flow label for a new flow within the maximum lifetime of any
   flow-handling state that might have been established for the prior
   use of that flow label.

6.3  Pseudoflow

   This specification introduces the concept of pseudoflow.  A
   pseudoflow is specified by the Flow Label only.  Unlike the 3-tuple
   definition of the flow [1], a pseudoflow is defined by the one-tuple
   Flow Label.

   In a pseudoflow, packets may carry source address of a node other
   than where the pseudoflow originated and destination address of a
   node other than where the pseudoflow will terminate.  Thus, a
   pseudoflow originating at an upstream node, which may not be the
   source node, continues to the next-hop node and terminates in the
   next-hop node, which may not be the destination node.  The label



Chakravorty             Expires August 21, 2005                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   binding in the lead packet may be reused for a pseudoflow going via
   nodes downstream of the pseudoflow origination node.

   This defintion of pseudoflow has been adopted in this specification
   to avoid confusion with the existing flow defintion in [1].

   In 6LSA, if a Flow Label has a 0 (zero) label, the packet containing
   such a label may still be treated as a part of a group of packets in
   a "flow" in which all packets have the same source and destination
   addresses and the same label binding to FEC.  The 6LSA node may bind
   the label to an FEC and process the packet such that it can later be
   associated with other packets with the same source and destination
   addresses and FEC binding.  The transmission of such packets is
   called a pseudoflow to distinguish it from the conventional version
   of flow that comprises a non-zero label.

   In this document, for simplicity, a pseudoflow is often called a flow
   when the context is clearly stated.

6.4  Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)

   The Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) represents forwarding
   treatment that a group of IPv6 packets receive.  The forwarding
   treatment may be based on one or more attributes associated with the
   flow or other processing requirements imposed on the flow externally.

   Several flows from multiple sources may receive the same forwarding
   treatment and thus belong to the same FEC.  For example, if multiple
   flows are to be processed in the same outgoing queue because they all
   deliver the same QoS, they are identified by the same FEC.

6.5  Labeled Packet

   In 6LSA, a packet that has a label value that a node can bind to a
   FEC is called a labeled packet.  A labeled packet is an IPv6 packet
   whose header has a zero or non-zero Flow Label.

   All packets in a flow in 6LSA have a non-zero label value, while all
   packets in a pseudoflow may have zero label value.  If an incoming
   packet into a 6LSA node has a zero label value and it is not a lead
   packet (see Section 6.7), it may be assigned a non-zero label value
   before it is forwarded to a downstream node.

   The label is a part of the IPv6 header and not an extraneous,
   encapsulating label loaded on the packet.  However, the value of the
   label may be transferred from a packet Flow Label field to a label
   field in layer 2 such as into an MPLS label space, if adequate label
   space is available and as the packet moves from a 6LSA domain to an



Chakravorty             Expires August 21, 2005                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   MPLS-enabled network domain or vice versa.  In the case of ATM, the
   label value may be encoded in the VPI/VCI fields to extend the label
   and related FEC attributes to the ATM layer.

   The label from a flow in the 6LSA thus may be transferred to a
   non-6LSA network layer or to a non-6LSA data link layer as long as
   there is a field available that can carry the 6LSA label.  The
   particular encoding technique and its significance must be agreed by
   both the layers - layer 3, the network layer, and layer 2, the data
   link layer.  Specifics of the method of this encoding are outside the
   scope of this document.

6.6  IPv6 Label Switching Router (6LSR)

   A router operating in the 6LSA is an IPv6 label switching router,
   called 6LSR, which performs as a minimum the two 6LSA functions of:
   1) replacing (swapping) an incoming label in a packet with an
   outgoing label, and 2) forwarding the packet based on the appropriate
   forwarding treatment.

   A 6LSR is so called in this specification because other protocols,
   such as the MPLS, identify a label switching router as an LSR which
   has different capabilities.  This helps avoid any ambiguity with the
   definition of LSR.

   A 6LSR is either an upstream 6LSR or downstream 6LSR, the
   relationship means that with respect to a given label binding, a
   particular label represents a specific FEC for packets traveling out
   of the former into a next-hop node or 6LSR, or into the latter from a
   next-hop node or 6LSR.

6.7  Lead Packet

   A packet arriving at a 6LSA node is a lead packet if it is the first
   packet of the flow that this node has received.  A lead packet may or
   may not be the first packet of a flow that the upstream router or
   6LSR forwarded to this 6LSR.  It is possible that the first packet in
   the flow is lost or misdirected, or for that matter, first few
   packets in the flow are lost or misdirected.

   All lead packets, whether they are the first packet from the upstream
   router or 6LSR or not, are treated like they were the first packet of
   the flow.

   Lead packet has no existing entry in the switching table of the 6LSR.
   All lead packets have a 0 (zero) label coming into the 6LSA nodes
   from a best-effort network.  When source nodes are 6LSA nodes, lead
   packets may carry non-zero labels.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


6.8  Packet Identifier (PID) Field

   An identifier, called Packet Identifier (PID) is a field in the
   switching table entry.  The concept of switching table is later
   described in this specification (see Section 6.9).  This field is
   updated whenever a packet is received by 6LSR.  The PID value entered
   is 0 (zero), if the packet is identified as a lead packet, it is 1
   (one), if the packet is a NTL or subsequent packet, that is, it is
   not a lead packet.

6.9  Switching Table

   A switching table in 6SLA, similar to what is called the forwarding
   table in the common networking literature, comprises the following
   information as they become available:

   	*  Label value from the lead packet, if there is a non-zero label,
   otherwise a zero value is entered

   	*  Packet Identifier (PID) Field value of 0 (zero) or 1 (one)

   	*  Incoming interface, that is, interface on which the packet
   arrived

   	*  Packet∆s next hop

   	*  Outgoing interface, that is, the interface on which the packet is
   forwarded to the next-hop 6LSR

   	*  FEC value that identifies the forwarding operation that needs to
   be performed on a packet; this may include ordering and queuing of
   the packet prior to its transmission

   The outgoing label entered in the switching table has to be unique so
   that the 6LSR is able to identify a unique LSP for the packet.  An
   exception would be when multiple LSPs are merged.  [This is discussed
   further in the following sections.]

   Additional information that may be available in the switching table
   is as follows.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   	*  The data link layer and encapsulation to use
   	*  How the label value needs to be encoded in the Flow Label field
   	*  Timers associated with the packet
   	*  Last packet in the flow
   	*  Information with regard to how to discard labels or packets

   The format and content of the switching table entry are
   implementation and configuration specific and are not specified here.

6.10  Attributes of Label Binding

   The binding of a label to an FEC is based on known attributes of the
   packet or on externally applied constraints.  The FEC may be
   associated with one or more of the following: Traffic Class, label
   value, source address, destination address, TCP/UDP port number, RTP
   value, one or more extension headers, special cookie marker in the
   packet, or special bit encoding in the body of the message past the
   protocol headers.  The FEC may also represent packet-forwarding
   parameters selected by the network administrator apriori.  For
   instance, if an attribute is a 1 Mbps bandwidth allocation to a flow
   then this allocation is taken care of in the forwarding treatment of
   the packet identified by a related FEC.

   The binding of a label to FEC is local to a 6LSR unless such binding
   is promulgated across the network through some exterior means such as
   a using a label distribution protocol (LDP) commonly used for MPLS.
   LDP is outside the scope of this document.

   The attributes of a label binding are configurable or encodable
   parameters in the 6LSA.  The details of how the attributes are
   activated will be presented in a future traffic engineering
   specification.

6.11  IPv6 Label Switched Path (6LSP)

   A label switched path in the 6LSA is called 6LSP and identifies a
   virtual circuit through which one or more flows are routed to the
   next-hop 6LSR.

   While a flow has a local, per-hop significance, a 6LSP may have
   end-to-end, multiple-hop significance within the 6LSA.  A 6LSP is
   thus identified with a sequence of 6LSAs, (R1,i,Rn), such that the
   following characteristics are applicable:


   	*	R1, the ingress 6LSR, acquires a label and swaps
   		it with the current label in packet P unless the
   		the packet is a lead packet;



Chakravorty             Expires August 21, 2005                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   	*	For all values of i, where 1 < i < n+1, there is
   		only one label in each IPv6 packet, P, and this
   		label value is encoded in the Flow Label
   		field of P;

   	*	At no time during P∆s transit through the network
   		of 6LSRs within a 6LSP, the label value is not
   		bound to a FEC, however, an FEC can be a best-effort
   		delivery FEC;

   	*	For all i, where 1 < i < n or 1 < i < n+1, Ri
   		transmits P to R[i+1] by using the outgoing label
   		in the packet (which is the same as the incoming
   		label value in case of the lead packet);

   	*	For all i, 1 < i < n, if a system S receives and
   		forwards P after P is transmitted by Ri and
   		before P is received by R[i+1], the forwarding
   		decision that S makes is not based on the
   		specifications applicable to 6LSA as identified
   		in this document; such forwarding decision will
   		imply that a layer 2 or other non-6LSA decision has
   		been made outside the scope of this specification;

   	*	Rn, the egress 6LSR, removes the incoming label and
   		swaps it with the original label (that the ingress
   		6LSR received) and forwards the packet out based 0n
   		the next-hop address unless there is peultimate 6LSR
   		label swapping, in which case, Rn may forward the
   		packet based on the FEC but without binding the
   		outgoing label to the FEC.

   The sequence of 6LSA nodes, more accurately, the sequence of node
   interfaces through which P is transported represents a 6LSP.  A 6LSP
   is thus represented by a label between any two nodes, and by one or
   more sequence of labels between ingress and egress 6LSRs, or between
   two or more hosts, or any combination thereof.  Conversely, it also
   represents the FEC binding of each flow from each of the 6LSR on the
   6LSP.  In this regard, 6LSP resembles a virtual circuit (VC) in ATM,
   and LSP in MPLS.

   A representative 6LSA layout is shown in Figure 1.  In this layout,
   labels are encoded in the Flow Label field of the outgoing packets
   that are not lead packets, out of the ingress 6LSR, A, the
   intermediate 6LSR, B, and removed only at the egress 6LSRs, C, D and
   E when the flow of packets is from west to east.  The process is
   similar for the flows entering into the four border 6LSRs, A, C, D,
   and E in the opposite direction and for intermediate 6LSR.  There can

   Multiple 6LSPs may merge at a 6LSR if they can be identified with the
   same FEC and their outgoing route (6LSP) is the same in that they can
   terminate on the same next-hop 6LSR interface.  If there are no other
   egress routers but E, in the representative configuration shown in
   Figure 2, the flows coming on three 6LSPs represented by L1, L2, and
   L3 into B are merged and sent out on one 6LSP represented by L6.  In
   this case, the flows maintain their identity by their source and
   destination addresses even if their outgoing labels are the same on
   6LSP.  This is also true of the lead packet flows where labels out of
   A would be all of 0 (zero) value.

   		    Representation of 6LSPs inside a 6LSA

   Each 6LSP is maintained at least for the duration of the session of
   transport of all packets in a flow.  In 6LSA, labels may be
   maintained for a pre-determined time after a session has ceased to
   exist, that is, for a fixed amount of time determined apriori after
   packets belonging to a flow have ceased to arrive.

   A 6LSP may extend all the way to the end-system if the end-system is
   operating within the 6LSA.

7.  6LSA Functionalities

   This section provides details of 6LSA functionalities including label
   acquiring, label binding to FEC, and label swapping.

7.1  Label Assignment

   In the 6LSA, the decision to assign or bind a label to a particular
   FEC is made by a 6LSA node, generally the ingress 6LSR if it is the
   origination point for that flow; in this case the flow is a
   pseudoflow by definition.  The host or 6LSR node then informs the
   next-hop, downstream node of this binding via the labeled IPv6 packet
   that is transmitted or via some other method depending on the nature
   of label generation and distribution methodologies.

   The 6LSA incorporates three models for acquiring label space.  The
   first model specifies locally generated labels; the second model
   refers to label distribution, and the third, acquires labels from the

   Flow Labels available in the incoming packet headers.  Only one of
   these three models of label assignment is allowed in a network of
   6LSA-based nodes.

   Once a label binding is available, the 6LSA requires that the label
   binding be retained for the duration of the session.

   It is quite possible that multiple flows may require the same label
   and label binding to a single FEC.  In these cases, all such flows
   may be multiplexed together as one outgoing flow and forwarded on one
   6LSP using the same label.  At the de-multiplexing 6LSA node
   downstream, the flows must be discernible through the unique source
   and destination addresses or through other means.

   The 6LSA does not prevent any 6LSA node from storing any label
   generated at a time different from when it is being used nor does the
   6LSA prevent a node from using any label that was used earlier or
   gotten from a flow that used an algorithm or a model other than those
   specified here.  The three models for label generation in this
   document are detailed below.

7.1.1  Locally Generated Label Model

   In this model, 6LSA allows a node to generate its own labels to be
   used in the IPv6 header.  The specification for the algorithm(s) used
   to generate the 20-bit labels is beyond the scope of this document.
   An example algorithm for generating flow labels is a pseudorandom
   number generator outputting values in which the bit fields are within
   the parameters specified in Section 6.1, Label.  It is envisioned
   that a set of labels will be genrated for every service class,
   elastic and inelastic, such as file transfer, voice, video, etc.

   The Locally Generated Label model does not preclude manual generation
   of a label or range of labels through a configurator or similar other
   means.  The locally generated label may have a value related to one
   or more attributes that is applicable to the next-hop 6LSR or nodes
   across the network.

   The 6LSA specification allows labels that are locally generated but
   may have non-local significance.  Such attributes may be regularly or
   randomly refreshed by any network management or other systems.
   Methodologies for such refreshment are outside the scope of this
   specification.

   The model is not a mandatory part of 6LSA, i.e., a node is not
   required to implement this model in order to be considered
   6LSA-compliant.  However, when a 6LSA node claims to implement the
   Locally Generated Label Model, the implementation must conform to the

   specification given in this document.

   This document encourages the use of this model because it is simple,
   efficient and avoids control plane traffic for label distribution as
   in the Distributed Label Model (see Section 7.1.2 below).  The
   Locally Generated Label Model enhances security since the labels have
   local significance only and can be randomly or periodically refreshed
   all through the 6LSA domain prior to their use.

7.1.2  Distributed Label Model

   The 6LSA allows distribution of label space generated in one or more
   nodes or externally in a server.  The architecture also allows more
   than one label distribution protocol and sharing of necessary
   information amongst the label distribution peers.  Mechanisms or
   protocols that allow a 20-bit label distribution and do not violate
   any of the 6LSA specification with regard to use of such labels and
   the operation of 6LSA nodes are allowed.  The specifics of label
   distribution protocols are outside the scope of this document.

   How label binding is distributed when applicable in the 6LSA and how
   a node binds a label to a FEC are outside the scope of this document.
   The flows generated by the 6LSA nodes using this model do not meet
   the definition of flow as specified in [2] and [3].

7.1.3  Reuse Label Model

   The 6LSA allows a node to reuse existing label available in the node
   or obtained from labels in the incoming packets and where the flows
   can be associated with unique label bindings.

   This label model is not recommended for large 6LSA domains; in large
   domains undesirable duplication of labels can occur.  This model
   requires a single-bit field, the MSB field, in the label to represent
   the identity of the packet as the lead packet or non-lead packet.  It
   is similar to the PID value in the switching table.  In the model, if
   this PID-representative bit is 0 (zero), the packet is a lead packet
   and if it is 1 (one), the packet is not a lead packet but a NTL or
   subsequent packet.  This bit assignment requires IANA registration
   which has not been done for this specification.  This bit assignment
   potentially reduces the number of 6LSPs between two peering nodes to
   one half of a million from a million.

   Details of this model remain to be developed for future
   specification.

7.2  Scope and Uniqueness of Labels

   A label in a packet on a 6LSP must be unique to a flow, in any given
   direction, between interfaces on peering nodes that are one hop
   apart.

   A flow always originates at the upstream source node in the 6LSA
   domain, continues through multiple 6LSRs and terminates in the
   destination node which also must exist in the 6LSA.  Such a flow must
   carry a non-zero label in its lead packet.

   A pseudoflow, on the other hand, originates at an upstream 6LSA node,
   which may be a 6LSR, continues to the next-hop node and terminates
   there.  This next-hop node may also be a 6LSR.  The lead packet in a
   pseudoflow carries a 0 (zero) label.

   For the example shown in Figure 3, an upstream 6LSA node, A, may bind
   a label L1 to FEC X for a flow to a downstream node, B, and B may use
   the same label, L1, or a different label (not shown) to identify a
   return flow Y from B to A, while at the same time A may bind another
   label L2 to FEC X for a different flow to node, C, which in turn may
   bind label L1 to FEC X for a flow to node D and label L2 to FEC X to
   another node E.

   Conversely, a given upstream node, A, may bind label L to FEC F1 and
   then to FEC F2 so long as these FECs represent flows to different
   downstream nodes, in this case, B and C.  See Figure 4 below.

                          Same Label in Multiple Flows
   	                        Figure 4.

   However, two upstream nodes, A and C, may bind label L to FEC F1 and
   also to FEC F2 for two different flows to the same downstream node,
   B, provided B is able to determine that the two flows are different
   otherwise the 6LSA requires that the upstream 6LSR not bind the same
   label to two different flows to the same next-hop 6LSR.  See Figure 5
   below, in this case the downstream 6LSR is able to determine that the
   two flows are different.  What applies to two flows also applies to
   more than two flows.

   Multiple flows from upstream 6LSRs may bind label L to multiple FECs
   F1, F2, F3, etc., for multiple flows as shown in Figure 6, or to the
   same FEC F for multiple flows.  The 6LSR B binds one label to all the
   outgoing flows to the downstream 6LSR C.  This is called flow
   merging.  In this case, C is not able to determine on its own that
   multiple flows from B are different because they carry the same label
   and arrive on the same interface.  The differentiation is possible if
   the downstream 6LSR can identify the uniqueness of the flows through
   source and destination addresses, if an extraneous label distribution
   protocol such as the Distributed Label Model is used, or if the 6LSA

7.3  Label Retention Mode

   If a 6LSR B receives a label binding from a 6LSR A for a particular
   FEC via an LDP, even though B is more than one hop apart from A, then
   such binding may be retained or discarded by B.  If the binding is
   retained, then this binding may be used later when A becomes a next

   hop 6LSR to B.  If the binding is discarded, then B will have to
   acquire a new binding for traffic from A through one of the three
   models described in Section 6.5.

7.4  Packet Forwarding

   Whatever the incoming label, unless the label carries some special
   significance because of certain bit arrangement in the label or some
   parameters associated with the label that were configured apriori,
   the forwarding treatment of the label is of local significance and
   decided by the 6LSA node itself.  This treatment may or may not be
   the same the packet receives in any other node.  The 6LSP chosen for
   the packet is thus based on the local FEC.  The nature of the
   forwarding treatment and how it is applied is out of scope for this
   document.  The only exception to this rule may be a case when a label
   value is assigned globally, by policy, for example.

7.5  Label Stacking

   The 6LSA does not allow label stacking.  There is only one label in a
   packet and this label must be in the Flow Label field in the IPv6
   packet header.  The 6LSA allows multiple label spaces per platform
   however the use of the label must conform to the specifications
   stated in this document.

7.6  Label Swapping

   Label swapping or label switching is a process in which the incoming
   label in a packet is replaced with an outgoing label.  In this
   document, this process is associated with multiple other activities
   elaborated below.  These activities include matching switching table
   entries with certain incoming packet header fields, binding a label
   to the FEC, updating the switching table and finally, forwarding the
   packet.  However, when the swapping involves only incoming label
   replacement with an outgoing label, it is called label switching,
   which typically is a fast process and may be carried out in the
   interface card itself.

7.7  Packet Processing Algorithm

   The 6LSA packet processing algorithm includes handling packets that
   arrive from the outside networks into the 6LSA domain or when they
   arrive from hosts in the same 6LSA domain.  The 6LSA domain
   processing provides QoS priority handling or such other treatment
   that the packets need.

   In this section, the sequence of basic steps needed for processing a
   packet inside 6LSA is detailed.



Chakravorty             Expires August 21, 2005                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   The simplest 6LSA domain consists of three nodes: the source node or
   ingress 6LSR, one destination node or egress 6LSR, and one 6LSR in
   between, the intermediate 6LSR.  In the next, more complex network
   configuration, there are four or more nodes with two or more
   intermediate 6LSRs.

   The incoming flows into any of the nodes can arrive on one or more
   6LSPs.  If the outgoing flows are merged onto the same 6LSP, the
   downstream node receives the merged flow with the same label and the
   flow arrives on the same interface.  Since there is no label stacking
   in 6LSA, there is no inherent advantage in flow merging.  Packets
   from different flows when merged into a single flow will still have
   different source and destination addresses, and distinction between
   flows thus can be made by the source and destination addresses when
   the merged flow arrives at a downstream node.

   If the incoming flows arrive on different 6LSPs and thus on different
   interfaces, then flows can be distinguished by their labels and/or by
   incoming interfaces.  As the complexity grows, there may be a
   combination of incoming flows representing different LSPs: merged and
   non-merged.

   In each step of packet processing, there are activities that relate
   to the components of the IPv6 header in addition to the Flow Label.
   One such component is the Hop Limit that is incremented every time a
   packet passes through a node in the 6LSA.  Additionally, if the
   packet has header extensions, such as Hop-by-Hop or Routing Header,
   they are processed as in the conventional IPv6 routing environment.
   Such extensions may be represented in the FEC.

   Recall that a 6LSA node must use only one label model at any time,
   for example, if it is using the Distributed Label Model, it must not
   use the Locally Generated Label Model.

7.7.1  Packet Processing in Locally Generated Label Model

   The key considerations of packet processing in this model are as
   follows:

   *  A 6LSA domain network peers in Layer 3 with one or more other
   networking domains.

   *  All packets into and out of 6LSA domains carry 0 (zero) labels.

   *  Within a 6LSA domain, a source node may generate one or more
   unique labels and  forward all packets with one, unique label for a
   given flow, or may forward  lead packet with a 0 (zero) label and the
   NTL and subsequent packets with locally generated label.



Chakravorty             Expires August 21, 2005                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   *  If the lead packet from an upstream node is lost before reaching
   the next-hop  6LSR, then the NTL packet with a non-zero label will be
   treated by the  downstream 6LSR as the lead packet and forwarded with
   the same incoming non-zero label.

   *  If a lead packet with a 0 (zero) label in a flow is forwarded to a
   next-hop  6LSR different from the one to which the NTL and subsequent
   packets from the  same flow (such all packets having the same source
   and destination addresses)  are forwarded to, then two scenarios are
   possible.  If the lead packet shows up  before the NTL packet in the
   downstream 6LSR, then the forwarding process will  be as specified
   here.  However, if the lead packet shows up after the NTL or
   subsequent packet, then the lead packet is processed as a lead packet
   while the  NTL packet is also processed as a lead packet but with its
   non-zero label.   Based on the flow characteristics and label
   bindings, the 6LSR however may  provide the same forwarding treatment
   to both flows and thus forward the  packets out the same interface
   over the same 6LSP.  If this is an egress 6LSR, the outgoing label
   will be zero in all the packets.

   *  If a lead packet with a non-zero label in a flow is forwarded to a
   next-hop 6LSR different from the one to which the NTL and subsequent
   packets from the  same flow (such all packets having the same source
   and destination addresses)  are forwarded to, then two scenarios are
   possible here as well.  If the lead  packet shows up before the NTL
   packet in the downstream 6LSR, then the  forwarding process will be
   as specified here.  However, if the lead packet  shows up after the
   NTL or subsequent packet, then the lead packet is processed  as an
   NTL or subsequent packet while the NTL packet is processed as a lead
   packet all with the same non-zero label.  Based on the flow
   characteristics and  label bindings, the 6LSR however may provide the
   same forwarding treatment to  both the incoming flows and thus
   forward the packets out the same interface  over the same 6LSP.  If
   this is an egress 6LSR, the outgoing label will be zero  in all the
   packets.

   *  If there is a match for the incoming label and interface in the
   switching table, then the incoming label is swapped with the outgoing
   label from the  switching table.  The PID value in the switching
   table is updated to 1 (one) if  it was 0 (zero).

   *  In egress 6LSR peering with some other network router, FEC does
   not exist  since the packets are transmitted out to the other network
   based on the  next-hop address.

   *  If packets carrying non-zero labels arrives from an external,

   such packets with the incoming label via its  domain out to the same
   or other external domain unless the label binding is  available
   apriori to the egress 6LSR.  If this is not the case, the 6LSA domain
   may forward the packet with a zero-label from the egress 6LSR.  This
   may by  default enhance security of the overall end-to-end
   networking.

                                         Figure 8.


   The values in the incoming, transiting and outgoing packet columns
   below indicate incoming label, and source and destination address
   values.  All packets are arriving into A from a non-6LSA, best effort
   domain and going out of C into a non-6LSA and therefore all packets
   have 0 (zero) label.

   The following observations represent the packet processing in Figure
   8.

   The label in the lead packet of a flow is not swapped in any of the
   6LSRs regardless of its label.  The PID value in the switching table
   is 0 (zero) for the lead packet.  The 6LSR acquires a label, binds
   the lead packet label to a FEC and makes an entry in the 6LSR
   switching table for the incoming label as well as the acquired label
   for this flow, incoming interface (the physical port or link on which
   the packet arrived is not shown), outgoing interface (not shown),
   source and destination addresses, and the FEC (not shown).  The
   outgoing interface, that is, the physical port or link on which the
   packet has to be transmitted out is determined from the IPv6 routing
   table, FEC or other similar means, and entered into the switching
   table.  How the 6LSR determines the best interface for the given FEC
   is outside the scope of this document and will be specified in future
   work.

   The label in each NTL packet, as well as the label in each packet
   thereafter is swapped with an outgoing label, meaning, the incoming
   label is replaced with a unique, acquired label.  This label is the
   same in all outgoing packets for the same flow irrespective of
   whether the outgoing label is acquired through Locally Generated
   Label Model or through some other means.

   The label entry may be flagged for the way the label was acquired by
   the 6LSR, however, such flagging is outside the scope of this
   specification.  After the label is swapped, the 6LSR binds the label
   to the FEC and applies the forwarding treatment for that FEC.  The
   labeled packet is forwarded out of the interface that is determined
   by the applicable routing protocol.

7.7.1.2  Algorithm for Non-Merging Flows

   The following steps describe the operations of this algorithm.  The
   algorithm changes for the 6LSA in which all nodes, that is, the
   source and destination nodes as well as all 6LSRs, exist in the 6LSA
   domain.  In this case, lead packets from the source node may carry
   non-zero labels.  When such packets arrive at the first 6LSR, the
   latter can determine they are lead packets, and maintains the label.
   So does all other intermediate 6LSRs.  The last 6LSR, possibly one
   hop upstream of the destination node, maintains this label also since
   the next node, the destination node is in the 6LSA domain.

   a)  Ingress 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match source
   and destination addresses in the incoming packet with those in the
   switching table.

      i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet; acquire an
   outgoing label which is unique for the outgoing interface and
   represents the pre-selected FEC for this flow, make switching table
   entry for this packet including the labels and the PID value of 0
   (zero), and forward the packet out; there is no swapping of incoming
   with the outgoing label.

      ii) If there is a match, and the PID value is 0 (zero) in the
   switching table, this is an NTL packet in the flow.  Swap the
   incoming label with the outgoing one in the switching table, set the
   PID to 1 (one), and forward the packet out.

      iii)If there is a match and the PID value is 1 (one) in the
   switching table, this is a subsequent packet in the flow.  Swap the
   incoming label with the outgoing label and forward the packet.

   b)  Intermediate 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match
   the incoming label and interface with those in the switching table.

      i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet and the operation
   is same as a(i) above.

      ii) If there is a match for only the incoming label, i.e., if no
   outgoing label exists, then this is a lead packet and the operation
   is same as a(i) above.

     iii) If there is a match, for both the label and the interface,
   this is an NTL or a subsequent packet in this flow.  Swap the
   incoming label with the outgoing label and forward the packet out.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   c)  Egress 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match the
   incoming label and interface with those in the switching table.

      i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet, look up the
   next-hop route and make switching table entry for this packet
   including the label, the PID value of 0 (zero) and the route for the
   outgoing packet, and forward the packet out; there is no label
   binding, and there is no label swapping if the incoming label is 0
   (zero) otherwise swap the incoming label with 0 (zero) label for
   peering with the best-effort network.

      ii) If there is a match for only the incoming label and not the
   interface, then this is a lead packet and the operation is same as
   c(i) here above.

      iii) If there is a match for both the label and interface in the
   same entry, this is an NTL or a subsequent packet in this flow and
   the operation is same b(iii)  above.


7.7.1.3  Algorithm for Merging Flows

   Packets arriving at a downstream 6LSA node that belong to different
   flows but have the same label and arrive on the same interface are
   said to belong to a merged flow.  Such packets cannot be efficiently
   differentiated by the downstream node without the apriori knowledge
   of how the flows were merged in the upstream 6LSR or through some
   other means.

   The following steps describe the operations of the algorithm when the
   flows out of the upstream 6LSR are merged and forwarded as a single
   flow to the next-hop 6SLR.

   a)  Ingress 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match source
   and destination addresses in the incoming packet with that in the
   switching table.  The matching by source and destination addresses
   identifies the uniqueness of the flow.

      i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet and the operation
   is same as for the lead packet described above in a(i).

      ii)  If there is a match, and the PID value is 0 (zero) in the
   switching table, this is an NTL packet in the flow, swap the incoming
   label with the outgoing one in the switching table, increment the PID
   to 1 (one), and forward the packet out.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


      iii)  If there is a match and the PID value is 1 (one) in the
   switching table, this a subsequent packet in the flow, switch the
   incoming label with the outgoing label and forward the packet out.

   b)  Intermediate 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match
   the incoming label and interface with those in the switching table.

      i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet and the operation
   is same as a(i) above.

      ii) If there is a match for the incoming label and not the
   incoming interface, and the PID value is 0 (zero) in the switching
   table, then this is a lead packet and the operation is same as b(i)
   here.

      iii)If there is a match for both the label and the interface in
   the same entry, this is an NTL or a subsequent packet in this flow or
   another flow (if the upstream 6LSA node is merging flows), find a
   match for the source and destination addresses -

          - If there is a match, this is an NTL or a subsequent packet,
   the operation is same as for an NTL or subsequent packet describe
   above.

          - If there is no match, this is a lead packet and the
   operations are the same as described before for the lead packet.

   c)  In the egress 6LSR, when a packet arrives on an interface, match
   the incoming label and interface with those in the switching table.

      i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet, the operation is
   same as for a lead packet in an egress router as described above.

      ii) If there is a match for only the incoming label and not the
   interface, and the PID value is 0 (zero) in the switching table, then
   this is a lead packet and the operation is same as above for a lead
   packet exiting an egree 6LSR.

      iii) If there is a match for both the label and the interface in
   the same entry, then this is an NTL or a subsequent packet in this
   flow or another flow (if the upstream 6LSR is merging flows).  Find
   matches for the source and destination addresses.

          - If there is a match of the addresses, this is a next-to-lead
   or subsequent packet; increment the PID to 1 (one) and forward the
   packet out after swapping incoming label with a 0 (zero) label.

          - If there is no match, this is a lead packet and the
   operations are the same as described before for a lead packet.


7.7.2  Packet Processing in Reuse Label Model

   Packet processing in this model is similar to that in the above
   packet processing description for the Locally Generated Label Model.
   The main difference is that in the label, the PID-representative bit
   is 0 (zero) when the packet is processed as a lead packet and 1
   (one), when the packet is processed not as a lead packet.  Details
   will be provided in future version of this specification.

7.7.3  Packet Processing in the Distributed Label Model

   Packet processing in this model is out of scope of this
   specification.  This is for future work and specification.

7.8  Fast Switching

   When a 6LSR can simply swap an incoming label with an outgoing label
   without going through insertion of new entry in the switching table
   for that packet, then this swapping is termed fast switching in this
   specification.

7.9  FEC Mapping

   Each FEC may map to a set of flows, node and route characteristics
   which may be represented in the switching table.  The switching table
   may consist of more than one entry that a particular FEC can be
   mapped to and forwarded via a labeled packet.

7.10  Penultimate 6LSR Label Processing

   If the label in a non-lead packet is acquired through the Locally
   Generated Label model and not through other means and applied to a
   packet in the 6LSR upstream of the penultimate 6LSR, the latter being
   the 6LSR one hop upstream of the egress 6LSR, the penultimate 6LSR
   may decide to not bind the label to the FEC for this flow but simply
   insert it in the packet and forward the packet out since the next hop
   is not affected by the absence of any prior label binding.  The
   egress 6LSR forwards the packet out based on the outgoing route.
   This saves processing related to binding at a minimum.

7.11  Invalid Incoming Labels

   An incoming or acquired label is invalid if it has a value that does
   not allow the 6LSA node to bind the label to a FEC.  Such a label may



Chakravorty             Expires August 21, 2005                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   be discarded after the lead packet is forwarded in a pseudoflow.
   Invalid labels may not include a zero-labeled packet.  The discussion
   of the values of such labels are outside the scope of this
   specification.

7.11.1  LSP Control: Ordered and Loose

   As described in the MPLS label switching architecture [2], some FECs
   correspond to address prefixes which are available from dynamic
   routing algorithm running in a node.  There are two methods in 6LSA
   for setting up LSPs for these FECs: Ordered and Loose.  The control
   of 6LSP is a local function at a 6LSA node.  In 6LSA, each FEC is
   identified with a set of attributes.

   If the traffic in a particular FEC has to follow the same path that
   has a specified set of attributes such as bandwidth and other
   resources (QoS parameters) etc., then ordered control must be used.
   How this ordered control is initiated and maintained is out of the
   scope of this document.  This is for further work and documentation.

   In the loose control, a 6LSR after binding a label to a FEC,
   distributes that binding to its label distribution peers more like
   the routing algorithms.

   Ordered control and loose control are fully interoperable.

7.12  Aggregation

   The 6LSA allows aggregation of labels when FECs represent address
   prefixes.  Since IPv6 address prefixes are aggregatable, aggregation
   of FECs corresponding to aggregatable prefixes is allowed in the
   6LSA.  The extent of aggregation is a function of the address
   aggregation, granularity of service desired or both.  Such
   aggregation may further be decided by the IPv6 packet header Traffic
   Class parameters.

7.13  Route Selection

   The method of selecting the proper 6LSP for a particular FEC is
   called route selection in the 6LSA and the options the 6LSA allows
   are (1) hop-by-hop routing, and (2) explicit routing.

   The hop-by-hop option has been described above in Section 7.7 in
   which each node in the 6LSA independently selects the next hop based
   on a given FEC.  This is very similar to the best-effort routing
   except that the forwarding in this mode of 6LSA is FEC driven.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


7.13.1  Hop-by-Hop Routing using Hop-by-Hop Header Extension

   To ensure per hop 6LSP execution, the 6LSA allows use of Hop-by-Hop
   Options header, identified by a Next Header value of 0 (zero) in the
   IPv6 header.  This increases processing at each node since the packet
   carries optional information that needs processing by every 6LSR
   along a packet's route.

7.13.2  Explicit Routing using Routing Header Extension

   To ensure explicit routing of packets, the 6LSA allows use of IPv6
   Routing Header extensions.  The Next Header value of 43 is then an
   attribute that a given FEC must include.  In this case, the label
   binding to the FEC represents explicit routing using the Next Header
   value.  The forwarding treatment a packet gets in a 6LSR comprises
   transmitting the packet to the next-hop 6LSR identified in the
   destination address field of the packet.  The final destination of
   the packet in an explicitly routed packet may be outside of the 6LSA
   domain.

7.14  Control

   The 6LSA specification requires the Hop Limit value in the packet
   header be decremented by 1 (one) in each 6LSR.  The 6LSA processing
   of Hop Limit remains the same as in conventional IPv6 packet
   processing.

7.15  Label Encodings

   The 6LSA allows encoding of the label value in layer 2 protocols such
   as in ATM packet's VPI/VCI fields.  Since only one label is used and
   that each such label is uniquely identifiable in the 6LSA, encoding
   the label in the ATM VPI/VCI field is feasible.  Considerations with
   respect to how flows are identified, the FEC-based forwarding
   treatment and flow merging issues need careful planning in layer 2
   label encoding.

   How a 6LSA label value is encoded in the ATM VPI/VCI field is outside
   the scope of this document.

7.16  Anycast in 6LSA

   IPv6 defines the anycast address like a regular unicast address with
   a prefix specifying the subnet and an identifier that is set to all
   zeroes.  Anycast packets delivered to this address are delivered to
   one router in that subnet.  There are reserved subnet anycast
   addresses such as for mobile IPv6 Home-Agents anycast.  The 6LSA
   allows the use of anycast addressing.  Whenever a 6LSR is a node in

   any anycast subnet, such a subnet may be a 6LSA, a subset of 6LSA or
   some other part of 6LSA.  When an anycast packet arrives in anycast
   subnet 6LSR where the subnet is a part or whole of 6SLA, the 6LSR
   binds the packet to a FEC which has anycast routing as part of the
   forwarding treatment attributes of the FEC.  The packet is thus
   forwarded to a next-hop 6LSR through an interface determined by the
   FEC attributes related to anycast forwarding.

7.17  Multicast in 6LSA

   IPv6 defines the mutlicast address by the high-order octet FF or
   11111111 in binary notation and 4 bits for the scope of the multicast
   and an identifier bit that indicates whether the multicast address
   belongs to a well-known IANA multicast address group or is a
   temporary address.

   The 6LSA allows the use of mutlicast addressing.  A multicast tree
   may be a 6LSA, or a subset of 6LSA.  For multicast transmission, the
   6LSR binds the packet to a FEC which may represent mutlicast routing.
   The packet is thus forwarded to a next-hop 6LSR through an interface
   determined by the FEC attributes related to mutlicast delivery.

8.  Security Considerations

   The 6SLA allows security association.  If the security association
   (SA) partners are outside the 6SLA, then there is no effect on the
   6SLA by the SA whether the mode of operation is in the transport mode
   or in the tunnel mode.

   In the transport mode of SA, only the packet payload is subject to
   encryption or authentication, so the IPv6 packet header features are
   not affected and the 6LSA being a transport mechanism that sets up
   6LSPs and provides specific FEC-driven forwarding treatment, there is
   no impact on the 6LSA or impact on SA operation by the 6SLA.

   In the tunnel mode of SA, the SA requires an outer wrapper IPv6
   packet.  The sending gateway wraps the whole IPv6 packet including
   the content.  The receiving gateway performs the checksum on the
   outer wrapper packet, unwraps the packet and then verifies the
   checksum of the inner packet through end-to-end SA.  If the outer
   wrapper packet conveys the Flow Label value of the inner packet, then
   6SLA provides the 6LSP transport based on the inner label value,
   otherwise the transport indicates the outer label value.  Here also,
   there is no impact on the 6LSA based transport of the secure packets
   or vice versa.

   The Authentication Header (AH) is used in IPv6 for authentication of
   individual packets to prevent common Internet-based attacks such as

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Label Switching Architecture       February 2005


   IP address spoofing and session hijacking.  The computation of
   cryptographically secure checksum over the payload as well as some
   fields of the IPv6 and extension headers has to take place between
   the SA partners.  This computation does not include the Flow Label
   field in the packet header.  This maintains label transparency in the
   6SLA.  Authentication can be either in the transport mode or in the
   tunnel mode.

   The 6SLA security considerations that apply to Encrypted Security
   Payload (ESP) header comprise encryption modes that are categorized
   as transport mode or tunnel mode.  In the transport mode, no
   encryption of the Flow Label field is performed, so the value is
   carried through the 6SLA.  In the tunnel mode, the issues are the
   same as stated here above.
