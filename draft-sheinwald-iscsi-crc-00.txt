Abstract 
    
   Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes [Peterson] are shortened cyclic 
   codes used for error detection. A number of CRC codes have been 
   adopted in standards: ATM, IEC, IEEE, CCITT, IBM-SDLC, and more 
   [Baich].  The most important expectation from such a code is a very 
   low probability for undetected errors.  The probability of undetected 
   errors on such codes has been, and still is, subject to extensive 
   studies that have included both analytical models and simulations. 
   Those codes have been used extensively in communications and magnetic 
   recording as they demonstrate good "burst error" detection 
   capabilities but they are good also in detecting several independent 
   bit errors.  Hardware implementations are very simple and well known 
   (their simplicity has made them popular with hardware developers for 
   many years) but algorithms and software for effective implementations 
   of CRC are now also widely available [Williams]. 
    
   The probability for undetected errors depends on the polynomial 
   selected, the error distribution (error model) and the data length. 
    
   In this memo, we attempt to give some estimates for the probability 
   of undetected errors that will facilitate the selection of an error 
   detection code for iSCSI.  
    
   We will also attempt to compare CRCs with other checksum forms 
   (Fletcher, Adler, weighted checksums) inasmuch as available data will 
   permit.

1. Error models and goals 
    
   We will analyze the code behavior under two conditions: 
    
      - noisy channel - burst errors of an average length of n bits 
      - low noise channel - independent single bit errors 
       
   Burst errors are the prevalent natural phenomenon on communication 
   lines and recording media. The numbers quoted for those revolve 
   around the BER (bit error rate) but frequently those numbers are 
   nothing else than a reflection of the Burst Error Rate multiplied by 
   the average burst length. In field engineering tests 3 numbers are 
   usually quote together - BER, error-free-seconds and severely-error-
   seconds - and this illustrates our point. 
    
   Even beyond communication and recording media the effects of errors 
   will be "bur sty"  -(e.g., a memory error will affect more than a 
   single bit and the total effect will not be very different from the 
   communication error, software errors while manipulating packets will 
   have a burst effect).  Software errors result also in burst errors. 
   In addition serial internal interconnects will make this type of 
   error the most common within machines too. 
    
   We analyze also the effects of single independent bit errors - as 
   those can be cause by some defects.  
    
   On burst we will assume an average burst error duration of bd that at 
   a given transmission rate s will result in an average burst of a = 
   bd/s bits 
   (e.g., an average burst duration of 3 ns at 1Gbs gives an average 
   burst of 3 bits). 
    
   For the burst error rate we will take 10^-10 (the numbers quoted for 
   BER on wired communication channels are between 10^-10 to 10^-12 and 
   we consider the BER as burst-error-rate*average-burst-length).  
   Please however keep in mind that if the channel includes wireless 
   links the error rates can be substantially higher. 
    
   For independent single bit errors we will assume a 10^-11 error rate. 
    
   As the error detection mechanisms will have to transport large 
   amounts of data (petabytes=10^16 bits) without errors we will target 
   very low probabilities for undetected errors for all block lengths 
   (at 10Gb/s that much data can be sent in less than 2 weeks! on a 
   single link).

   Alternatively, as iSCSI has to perform, efficiently we will require 
   that the error detection capability of a selected protection 
   mechanism should be very good at least up to block lengths of 8k 
   bytes (64kbits). 
    
   The error detection capability should keep the probability of 
   undetected errors at values that would be mean "next-to-impossible".  
   We recognize however that such attributes are hard to quantify and we 
   resorted to physics - 10^23 is the Avogadro number while 10^45 is the 
   number of atoms in the known Universe (or it was many years ago when 
   we read about it) and those would the bounds of incertitude we could 
   live with. (10^-23 at worst and 10^-45 if we can afford it). For 8k 
   blocks the per/bit equivalent would be (10^-28 to 10^-50)

2. Background and literature survey 
    
   Each codeword of a binary (n,k) CRC code C consists of n = k+r bits. 
   The block of r parity bits is computed from the block of k 
   information bits. The code has a degree r generator polynomial g(x).  
    
   The code is linear in the sense that the bitwise addition of any two 
   codewords yields a codeword.  
    
   For the minimal m such that g(x) divides (x^m)-1, either n=m, and the 
   code C comprises the set D of all the multiplications of g(x) modulo 
   (x^m)-1, or n<m, and C is obtained from D by shortening each word in 
   the latter in m-n specific positions (which also reduces the number 
   of words since all zero words are then discarded and duplicates are 
   not maintained). 
    
   Error detection at the receiving end is made by computing the parity 
   bits from the received information block, and comparing them with the 
   received parity bits.  
     
   An undetected error occurs when the received word c' is a codeword 
   but different from the one c transmitted.  
    
   This is only possible when the error pattern e=c'-c is a codeword by 
   itself (because of the linearity of the code). The performance of a 
   CRC code is measured by the probability Pud of undetected channel 
   errors. 
    
   Let Ai denote the number of codewords of weight i, i.e., with i 1-
   bits. For a binary symmetric channel (BSC), with sporadic, 
   independent bit error rate 0<=epsilon<=0.5, the probability of 
   undetected errors for the code C is thus given by: 
    
   Pud(C,epsilon) = Sigma[for i=d to n] (Ai*(epsilon^i)*(1-epsilon)^(n-
   i)) 
    
   where d is the distance of the code: the minimal weight difference 
   between two code in C which, by the linearity of the code, is also 
   the minimal weight of any codeword in the code.  Pud can also be 
   expressed by the weight distribution of the dual code: the set of 
   words each of which is perpendicular (bitwise AND yields an even 
   number of 1-bits) to every word of C.  
   The fact that Pud can be computed using the dual code is extremely 
   important; regardless of the length of the code block - the number of 
   different codes in the dual code is 2^r. If we denote with Bi the 
   number of codewords of weight i, i.e., with i 1-bits then:

                       iSCSI CRC considerations            May 7, 2001 
 
 
    
   Pud (C,epsilon) = 2^-r Sigma [for i=0 to n] Bi*(1-2*epsilon)^i - (1-
   epsilon)^n 
    
   Wolf [Wolf94o] introduced an efficient algorithm for enumerating all 
   the codewords of a code, and finding their weight distribution. 
    
   Wolf [Wolf82] found that, counter to what was assumed, (1) there 
   exist codes for which Pud(C,epsilon)>Pud(C,0.5) for some epsilon not= 
   0.5 and (2) Pud is not always increasing for 0<=epsilon<=0.5.  The 
   value of what was assumed to be the worst Pud is Pud(C,0.5)=(2^-r) - 
   (2^-n). This stems from the fact that with epsilon=0.5, all 2^n 
   received words are equally likely and out of them 2^(n-r)-1 will be 
   accepted as codewords of no errors, although they are different from 
   the codeword transmitted. 
    
   Wolf [Wolf94j] investigated the CCITT 16-bit polynomial. This is a 
   code of the family of (shortened codes of) a BCH code of length 2^(r-
   1) -1 (r=16 in the CCITT 16-bit case) generated by a polynomial of 
   the form g(x) =(x+1)p(x) with p(x) being a primitive polynomial of 
   degree r-1 (=15 in this case). These codes have a BCH design distance 
   of 4. That is, the minimal distance between any two codewords in the 
   code is at least 4 bits (which is earned by the fact that the 
   sequence of powers of alpha, the root of p(x), which are roots of 
   g(x), includes three consecutive powers:                                           alpha^0, alpha^1, alpha^2). 
   Hence, every 3 single bit errors are detectable.  
    
   Wolf found that different shortened versions of a given code, of the 
   same codeword length, perform the same (independent of which specific 
   indexes are omitted from the original code). He also found that for 
   the unshortened codes, all primitive polynomials yield codes of the 
   same performance. But for the shortened versions, the choice of the 
   primitive polynomial does make a difference. Wolf [Wolf94j found a 
   primitive polynomial which (when multiplied by x+1) yields a 
   generating polynomial that outperforms the CCITT one by an order of 
   magnitude. For 32-bit, he found an example of two polynomials that 
   differ in their probability of undetected burst of length 33 by 4 
   orders of magnitude. 
    
   It so happens, that for some shortened codes, the minimum distance, 
   or the distribution of the weights, is better than for others derived 
   from different unshortened codes. 
    
   Baicheva et al [Baicheva] made a comprehensive comparison of 
   different generating polynomials of degree 16 of the form g(x) = 
   (x+1)p(x), and of other forms. They computed their Pud for code

   lengths up to 1024 bits. They measured their "goodnes"  -- if 
   Pud(C,epsilon)  <= Pud(C,0.5) and being "well-behaved" -- if 
   Pud(C,epsilon) increases with epsilon in the range 0,0.5.  The paper 
   gives a comprehensive table that lists which of the polynomials is 
   good and which is well-behaved for different length ranges. 
    
   For a single burst error, Wolf [Wolf94J] suggested the model of (b:p) 
   burst -- the errors only occur within a span of b bits, and within 
   that span, the errors occur randomly, with bit error probability 0 <= 
   p <= 1. 
    
   For p=0.5, which used to be considered the worst case, it is well 
   known that the probability of undetected one burst error of length b 
   <= r is 0, of length b=r+1 is 2^-(r-1), and of b > r+1, is 2^-r, 
   independently of the choice of the primitive polynomial.  
    
   With Wolf's definition,                          where p can be different than 0.5, indeed it 
   was found that for a given b there are values of p, different from 
   0.5 which maximize the probability of undetected (b:p) burst error.                                                                      
    
   Wolf proved that for a given code, for all b in the range r < b < n, 
   the conditional probability of undetected error for the (n, n-r) 
   code, given that a (b:p) burst occurred, is equal to the probability 
   of undetected errors for the same code (the same generating 
   polynomial), shortened to block length b, when this shortened code is 
   used with a binary symmetric channel with channel (sporadic, 
   independent) bit error probability p. 
    
   For the IEEE-802.3 used CRC32, Fujiwara [Fujiwara89] measured the 
   weights of all words of all shortened versions of the IEEE 802.3 code 
   of 32 check bits. This code is generated by a primitive polynomial of 
   degree 32:  
   g(x) = x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + 
   x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1 and hence the designed distance of it 
   is only 3. This distance holds for codes as long as 2^32-1. However, 
   the frame format of MAC (Media Access Control) of the data link layer 
   in IEEE 802.3, as well as that of the data link layer for the 
   Ethernet (1980) forbid lengths exceeding 12,144 bits. Fujiwara only 
   investigated such bounded lengths. They found that for shortened 
   versions, the minimum distance was found to be 4 for lengths 4096 to 
   12,144; 5 for lengths 512 to 2048; and even 15 for lengths 33 through 
   42.  
   Fujiwara gives a chart of results of calculations of Pud from which 
   we can see that for codes of length 12,144 and BSC of epsilon = 10^-5 
   - 10^-4, Pud= 10^-14 - 10^-13 and for epsilon = 10^-4 - 10^-3,  
   Pud(512,epsilon) = 10^-15

                       iSCSI CRC considerations            May 7, 2001 
 
 
   Pud(1024,epsilon) = 10^-14,  
   Pud(2048,epsilon) = 10^-13, 
   Pud(4096,epsilon) = 10^-12 - 10^-11, and 
   Pud(8192,epsilon) = 10^-10 which is rather close to 2^-32. 
    
   [Castagnoli93] extended Fujiwara's technique for efficiently 
   calculating the minimum distance through the weight distribution of 
   the dual code and explored a large number of CRC codes with 24 and 32 
   redundancy bit. They explored several codes built as a multiplication 
   of several lower degree irreducible polynomials. 
   In the popular class of (x+1)*deg31-irreducible-polynomial they 
   explored 47000 polynomials (not all the possible ones - 2*(2^30-
   1)/31). The best that they found has d=6 up to block lengths of 5275 
   and d=4 up to 2^31-1 (bits). 
   The investigation was done in 1993 with a special purpose processor 
    
   By comparison the IEEE-802 code has d=4 up to at least 64,000 bits 
   and d=3 up to 2^32-1 bits. 
    
   CRC32/4 (we will call it CRC32C in the rest of this memo) is 
   11EDC6F41;  IEEE-802 CRC is 104C11DB7 
    
   [Stone98] evaluated the performance of CRC (the AAL5 CRC that is the 
   same as IEEE802) and the TCP and Fletcher checksums on large amounts 
   of data. The results of this experiment indicate a serious weakness 
   of the checksums on real-data that stems from the fact that checksums 
   do not spread the "hot spots" in input data.  However, the results 
   show that Fletcher behaves by a factor of 2 better than the regular 
   TCP checksum.

3. Probability of undetected errors - burst error  
    
3.1 CRC32C (derivations from [Wolf94j]) 
    
   Wolf [Wolf94j] found a 32-bit polynomial of the form g(x) = (1+x)p(x) 
   for which the conditional probability of undetected error, given that 
   a burst of length 33 occurred, is at most (i.e., maximized over all 
   possible channel bit error probabilities within the burst) 4 * 10^-
   10. 
    
   We will now find the probability of undetected error, given that a 
   burst of length 34 occurred, using the result derived in this paper, 
   namely that for a given code, for all b in the range 32 < b < n, the 
   conditional probability of undetected error for the (n, n-32) code, 
   given that a (b:p) burst occurred, is equal to the probability of 
   undetected errors for the same code (the same generating polynomial), 
   shortened to block length b, when this shortened code is used with a 
   binary symmetric channel with channel (sporadic, independent) bit 
   error probability p. 
    
   The approximation formula for Pud of sporadic errors, if the weights 
   Ai are distributed binomially, is 
    
   Pud(C, epsilon) =~= Sigma[for i=d to n]*((n choose i) / 2^r )*(1-
   epsilon)^(n-i) * epsilon^i . 
    
   Assuming a very small epsilon, this expression is dominated by i=d. 
   From [Fujiwara89] we know that for 32-bit CRC, for such small n, 
   d=15. Thus, when n grows from 33 to 34, we find that the 
   approximation of Pud grows by 34/19; and when n grows further to 35, 
   Pud grows by another 35/20. Taking, from Wolf [Wolf94j], 
   Pud(p*|33) = 4 x 10^{-10}, we have  Pud(p*|34) = 7.15 x 10^{-10} and 
   Pud(p*|35) = 1.25 x 10^{-9}. 
    
   For the density function of the burst length, we assume the Rayleigh 
   density function (the discretization thereof to integer), which is 
   the density of the absolute values of complex numbers of Gauss 
   distribution: 
         f(x) = x / a^2  exp {-x^2 / 2a^2 }     , x>0 
   this density function has a peak at the parameter a, and it decreases 
   smoothly for growing x. 
   We take three consecutive bits as the most common burst event once an 
   error does occur, and thus a=3. 
    
   Now, the probability that a burst of length b occurs in a specific 
   position is the burst error rate, which we estimate as 10^{-10}, 
   times f(b).  
  
Sheinwald, D.    Informational , Expire October 2001               10 

                       iSCSI CRC considerations            May 7, 2001 
 
 
   Calculating for b=33 we find f(33) = 1.94 x 10^{-26}. 
   Together, we have that the probability that a burst of length 33 
   occurred which starts at a specific position is 1.94 x 10^{-36}. 
   Multiplying this by the probability that this burst error is not 
   detected, Pud(p*|33), we get that the probability that a burst that 
   occurred at a specific position is not detected is 7.79 x 10 ^{-46}. 
    
   Going again along this path of calculations, this time for b=34 we 
   find that f(34) = 4.85*10^{-28}. Multiplying by 10^{-10} and by 
   Pud(p*|34) = 7.15*10^{-10} we get that the probability that a burst 
   of length 34 that occurred at a specific position is not detected  
   is 3.46*10^{-47}. 
    
   Last, computing for b=35, we get 1*10^{-29} * 10^{-10} * 1.25*10^{-9} 
   = 1.25*10^{-48}. 
    
   It looks like the total can be approximated at 10^-45 within the 
   bounds of what we are looking for. 
    
   When we multiply this by the length of the code (because thus far we 
   calculated for a specific position) we have 10^-45 * 6.5*10^4 = 
   6.5*10^-41 as an upper bound on the probability of undetected burst 
   error for a code of length 8K Bytes. 
    
   We now start this whole calculation once again, with initial 
   probability P(p|33) worse than the best that Wolf [Wolf94j] found. 
   We will take the worst that he found, which he presented against the 
   best that he found. For this one, P(p*|33) = 5.1*10^{-6}. We will 
   thus multiply the end result we obtained before, 10^{-45} by 10^4, 
   the ratio of the best and the worst of Wolf, and conclude that  
   We can take 10^{-41} as an upper bound for the probability that a 
   burst occurred but was not detected by CRC32C. 
    
   We can also apply this overestimation for IEEE 802.3. 
    
   Comment:

4. Probability of undetected errors - independent errors  
    
4.1 CRC (derivations from [Castagnoli93]) 
    
   In [Castagnoli93] it is reported that for epsilon=10^-6, Pud for a 
   single bit error, for a code of length 8KB, for both cases, IEEE-
   802.3 and CRC32C is 10^{-20}. They also report that CRC32C has 
   distance 4, and IEEE either 3 or 4 for this code length. From this, 
   and the minimum distance of the code of this length, we conclude that 
   with our estimation of epsilon, namely 10^{-11}, we should multiply 
   the reported result by {10^{-5}}^4 = 10^{-20} for CRC32C, and either 
   10^{-15} or 10^{-20} for IEEE802.3. 
    
4.2 Checksums 
    
   For independent bit errors, Pud of CRC is approximately 12,000 better 
   than Fletcher, and 22,000 than Adler. For burst errors, by the simple 
   examples that exist for three consecutive values that can produce an 
   undetected burst, we take the factor to be at least the same. 
    
   If in three consecutive bytes, the error values are x, -2x, x then 
   the error is undetected. Even for this error pattern only, the 
   conditional probability of undetected error, assuming a uniform 
   distribution of data, is 2^-16 = 1.5 * 10^-5. The probability that a 
   burst of length 3 bytes occurs, is f(24) = 3*10^-14. Together: 
   4.5*10^-19. Multiplying this by the length of the code, we get close 
   to 4.5*10^-16, way worse than the vicinity of 10^-40. 
   The numbers in the table in Section 6 below reflect a more "tolerant" 
   difference (10*4).

5. Complexity of Hardware Implementation 
    
   Comparing the cost of various CRC polynomials, we have used a tool 
   available at http://www.easics.com/webtools/crctool to implement CRC 
   generators/checkers for various CRC polynomials. The program gives 
   either Verilog or VHDL code after specifying a polynomial and the 
   number of data bits, k, to be handled in one clock cycle. For a 
   serial implementation, k would be one. 
    
   The cost for either one generator or checker is shown in the 
   following table. 
    
   The number of 2-input XOR gates, for an un-optimized implementation, 
   required for various values of k: 
                                                             
   +----------------------------------------------+ 
   | Polynomial  | k=32     | k=64     | k=128    | 
   +----------------------------------------------+ 
   | CCITT-CRC32 | 488      | 740      | 1430     | 
   +----------------------------------------------+ 
   | IEEE-802    | 872      | 1390     | 2518     | 
   +----------------------------------------------+ 
   | CRC32Q(Wolf)| 944      | 1444     | 2534     | 
   +----------------------------------------------+ 
   | CRC32C      | 1036     | 1470     | 2490     | 
   +----------------------------------------------+ 
    
    
   After optimizing (sharing terms) and in terms of Cells (4 cells per 2 
   input AND, 7 cells per 2 input XOR, 3 cells per inverter) the cost 
   for two candidate polynomials is shown in the following table. 
    
   +-----------------------------------+ 
   | Polynomial  | k=32     | k=64     |  
   +-----------------------------------+ 
   | CCITT-CRC32 | 1855     | 3572     |  
   +-----------------------------------+ 
   | CRC32C      | 4784     | 7111     |  
   +-----------------------------------+ 
    
    
    
   For 32 bit datapath, CCITT-CRC32 requires 40% of the number of cells 
   that the CRC32C requires. For 64 bit datapath, CCITT-CRC32 requires 
   50%  the number of cells.

   The total size of one of our smaller chips is roughly 1 million 
   cells. The fraction represented by the CRC circuit is less than 1%.

6. Summary and conclusions 
    
    
   The following table is a summary of the error detection capabilities 
   of the different codes analyzed. I the table d is the minimal 
   distance at block length block (in bits), i/byte - software 
   instructions/byte, Table size (if table lookup needed), T-look number 
   of lookups/byte, Pudb - Pud burst and Puds - Pud sporadic: 
    
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
   | Code      |d| Block |i/Byte|Tsize|T-look| Pudb   | Puds   | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
   | Fletcher32|3| 2^19  | 2    |  -  | -    | 10^-37 | 10^-36 | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
   | Adler32   |3| 2^19  | 3    |  -  | -    | 10^-36 | 10^-35 | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
   | IEEE-802  |3| 2^16  | 2.75 | 2^18| 0.5/b| 10^-41 | 10^-40 | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
   | CRC32C    |3| 2^31-1| 2.75 | 2^18| 0.5/b| 10^-41 | 10^-40 | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
    
   The probabilities for undetected errors in the above table are 
   computed assuming uniformly distributed data.  For real data - that 
   can be biased - [Stone98] checksums behave substantially worse than 
   CRCs 
    
   Considering the protection level it offers, the lack of sensitivity 
   for biased data and the large block it can protect we think that 
   CRC32C is a good choice as a basic error detection mechanism for 
   iSCSI. 
    
   Please observe also that burst errors that are characterized by a 
   fixed average time will have higher impact on error detection 
   capability as the speed of the channels (machines and networks) 
   increases. The only long-term way to keep the Pud within bounds is to 
   reduce the BER by using better channel coding (as opposed to source 
   coding we where dealing with here).
