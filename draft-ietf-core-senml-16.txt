                    Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)
                        draft-ietf-core-senml-16

Abstract

   This specification defines a format for representing simple sensor
   measurements and device parameters in the Sensor Measurement Lists
   (SenML).  Representations are defined in JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), Extensible
   Markup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), which
   share the common SenML data model.  A simple sensor, such as a
   temperature sensor, could use one of these media types in protocols
   such as HTTP or CoAP to transport the measurements of the sensor or
   to be configured.

1.  Overview

   Connecting sensors to the Internet is not new, and there have been
   many protocols designed to facilitate it.  This specification defines
   a format and media types for carrying simple sensor information in a
   protocol such as HTTP [RFC7230] or CoAP [RFC7252].  The SenML format
   is designed so that processors with very limited capabilities could
   easily encode a sensor measurement into the media type, while at the
   same time a server parsing the data could relatively efficiently
   collect a large number of sensor measurements.  SenML can be used for
   a variety of data flow models, most notably data feeds pushed from a
   sensor to a collector, and the web resource model where the sensor is
   requested as a resource representation (e.g., "GET /sensor/
   temperature").

   There are many types of more complex measurements and measurements
   that this media type would not be suitable for.  SenML strikes a
   balance between having some information about the sensor carried with
   the sensor data so that the data is self describing but it also tries
   to make that a fairly minimal set of auxiliary information for
   efficiency reason.  Other information about the sensor can be
   discovered by other methods such as using the CoRE Link Format
   [RFC6690].

Internet-Draft                    SenML                         May 2018


   SenML is defined by a data model for measurements and simple meta-
   data about measurements and devices.  The data is structured as a
   single array that contains a series of SenML Records which can each
   contain fields such as an unique identifier for the sensor, the time
   the measurement was made, the unit the measurement is in, and the
   current value of the sensor.  Serializations for this data model are
   defined for JSON [RFC8259], CBOR [RFC7049], XML
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126], and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI)
   [W3C.REC-exi-20140211].

   For example, the following shows a measurement from a temperature
   gauge encoded in the JSON syntax.

   [
     {"n":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","v":23.1}
   ]

   In the example above, the array has a single SenML Record with a
   measurement for a sensor named "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" with a
   current value of 23.1 degrees Celsius.

2.  Requirements and Design Goals

   The design goal is to be able to send simple sensor measurements in
   small packets from large numbers of constrained devices.  Keeping the
   total size of payload small makes it easy to use SenML also in
   constrained networks, e.g., in a 6LoWPAN [RFC4944].  It is always
   difficult to define what small code is, but there is a desire to be
   able to implement this in roughly 1 KB of flash on a 8 bit
   microprocessor.  Experience with power meters and other large scale
   deployments has indicated that the solution needs to support allowing
   multiple measurements to be batched into a single HTTP or CoAP
   request.  This "batch" upload capability allows the server side to
   efficiently support a large number of devices.  It also conveniently
   supports batch transfers from proxies and storage devices, even in
   situations where the sensor itself sends just a single data item at a
   time.  The multiple measurements could be from multiple related
   sensors or from the same sensor but at different times.

   The basic design is an array with a series of measurements.  The
   following example shows two measurements made at different times.
   The value of a measurement is given by the "v" field, the time of a
   measurement is in the "t" field, the "n" field has a unique sensor
   name, and the unit of the measurement is carried in the "u" field.

Internet-Draft                    SenML                         May 2018


   [
     {"n":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","t":1.276020076e+09,
      "v":23.5},
     {"n":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","t":1.276020091e+09,
      "v":23.6}
   ]

   To keep the messages small, it does not make sense to repeat the "n"
   field in each SenML Record so there is a concept of a Base Name which
   is simply a string that is prepended to the Name field of all
   elements in that record and any records that follow it.  So a more
   compact form of the example above is the following.

   [
     {"bn":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","t":1.276020076e+09,
      "v":23.5},
     {"u":"Cel","t":1.276020091e+09,
      "v":23.6}
   ]

   In the above example the Base Name is in the "bn" field and the "n"
   fields in each Record are the empty string so they are omitted.

   Some devices have accurate time while others do not so SenML supports
   absolute and relative times.  Time is represented in floating point
   as seconds.  Values greater than or equal to 2**28 represent an
   absolute time relative to the Unix epoch.  Values less than 2**28
   represent time relative to the current time.

   A simple sensor with no absolute wall clock time might take a
   measurement every second, batch up 60 of them, and then send the
   batch to a server.  It would include the relative time each
   measurement was made compared to the time the batch was sent in each
   SenML Record.  The server might have accurate NTP time and use the
   time it received the data, and the relative offset, to replace the
   times in the SenML with absolute times before saving the SenML
   information in a document database.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document also uses the following terms:

Internet-Draft                    SenML                         May 2018


   SenML Record:  One measurement or configuration instance in time
      presented using the SenML data model.

   SenML Pack:  One or more SenML Records in an array structure.

   SenML Label:  A short name used in SenML Records to denote different
      SenML fields (e.g., "v" for "value").

   SenML Field:  A component of a record that associates a value to a
      SenML Label for this record.

   SensML:  Sensor Streaming Measurement List (see Section 4.8).

   SensML Stream:  One or more SenML Records to be processed as a
      stream.

   This document uses the terms "attribute" and "tag" where they occur
   with the underlying technologies (XML, CBOR [RFC7049], and Link
   Format [RFC6690]), not for SenML concepts per se.  Note that
   "attribute" has been widely used previously as a synonym for SenML
   "field", though.

   All comparisons of text strings are performed byte-by-byte (and
   therefore necessarily case-sensitive).

   Where arithmetic is used, this specification uses the notation
   familiar from the programming language C, except that the operator
   "**" stands for exponentiation.

4.  SenML Structure and Semantics

   Each SenML Pack carries a single array that represents a set of
   measurements and/or parameters.  This array contains a series of
   SenML Records with several fields described below.  There are two
   kinds of fields: base and regular.  Both the base fields and the
   regular fields can be included in any SenML Record.  The base fields
   apply to the entries in the Record and also to all Records after it
   up to, but not including, the next Record that has that same base
   field.  All base fields are optional.  Regular fields can be included
   in any SenML Record and apply only to that Record.

4.1.  Base Fields

   Base Name:  This is a string that is prepended to the names found in
      the entries.

   Base Time:  A base time that is added to the time found in an entry.




Jennings, et al.        Expires November 19, 2018               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    SenML                         May 2018


   Base Unit:  A base unit that is assumed for all entries, unless
      otherwise indicated.  If a record does not contain a Unit value,
      then the Base Unit is used.  Otherwise the value found in the Unit
      (if any) is used.

   Base Value:  A base value is added to the value found in an entry,
      similar to Base Time.

   Base Sum:  A base sum is added to the sum found in an entry, similar
      to Base Time.

   Version:  Version number of media type format.  This field is an
      optional positive integer and defaults to 5 if not present.  [RFC
      Editor: change the default value to 10 when this specification is
      published as an RFC and remove this note]

4.2.  Regular Fields

   Name:  Name of the sensor or parameter.  When appended to the Base
      Name field, this must result in a globally unique identifier for
      the resource.  The name is optional, if the Base Name is present.
      If the name is missing, Base Name must uniquely identify the
      resource.  This can be used to represent a large array of
      measurements from the same sensor without having to repeat its
      identifier on every measurement.

   Unit:  Unit for a measurement value.  Optional.

   Value:  Value of the entry.  Optional if a Sum value is present,
      otherwise required.  Values are represented using basic data
      types.  This specification defines floating point numbers ("v"
      field for "Value"), booleans ("vb" for "Boolean Value"), strings
      ("vs" for "String Value") and binary data ("vd" for "Data Value").
      Exactly one value field MUST appear unless there is Sum field in
      which case it is allowed to have no Value field.

   Sum:  Integrated sum of the values over time.  Optional.  This field
      is in the unit specified in the Unit value multiplied by seconds.
      For historical reason it is named sum instead of integral.

   Time:  Time when value was recorded.  Optional.

   Update Time:  Period of time in seconds that represents the maximum
      time before this sensor will provide an updated reading for a
      measurement.  Optional.  This can be used to detect the failure of
      sensors or communications path from the sensor.

                           Table 1: SenML Labels

   (*) Data Value is base64 encoded string with URL safe alphabet as
   defined in Section 5 of [RFC4648], with padding omitted.

   For details of the JSON representation see Section 5, for the CBOR
   Section 6, and for the XML Section 7.

4.4.  Extensibility

   The SenML format can be extended with further custom fields.  Both
   new base and regular fields are allowed.  See Section 12.2 for
   details.  Implementations MUST ignore fields they don't recognize
   unless that field has a label name that ends with the '_' character
   in which case an error MUST be generated.

   All SenML Records in a Pack MUST have the same version number.  This
   is typically done by adding a Base Version field to only the first
   Record in the Pack, or by using the default value.

   Systems reading one of the objects MUST check for the Version field.
   If this value is a version number larger than the version which the

   the version number to indicate that the object contains structure or
   semantics that is different from what is defined in the present

   this specification or it successors.

4.5.  Records and Their Fields

4.5.1.  Names

   The Name value is concatenated to the Base Name value to yield the
   name of the sensor.  The resulting concatenated name needs to
   uniquely identify and differentiate the sensor from all others.  The
   concatenated name MUST consist only of characters out of the set "A"
   to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", "-", ":", ".", "/", and "_";
   furthermore, it MUST start with a character out of the set "A" to
   "Z", "a" to "z", or "0" to "9".  This restricted character set was
   chosen so that concatenated names can be used directly within various
   URI schemes (including segments of an HTTP path with no special
   encoding; note that a name that contains "/" characters maps into
   multiple URI path segments) and can be used directly in many
   databases and analytic systems.  [RFC5952] contains advice on
   encoding an IPv6 address in a name.  See Section 14 for privacy
   considerations that apply to the use of long-term stable unique
   identifiers.

   Although it is RECOMMENDED that concatenated names are represented as
   URIs [RFC3986] or URNs [RFC8141], the restricted character set
   specified above puts strict limits on the URI schemes and URN
   namespaces that can be used.  As a result, implementers need to take
   care in choosing the naming scheme for concatenated names, because
   such names both need to be unique and need to conform to the
   restricted character set.  One approach is to include a bit string
   that has guaranteed uniqueness (such as a 1-wire address [AN1796]).
   Some of the examples within this document use the device URN
   namespace as specified in [I-D.ietf-core-dev-urn].  UUIDs [RFC4122]
   are another way to generate a unique name.  However, the restricted
   character set does not allow the use of many URI schemes, such as the
   'tag' scheme [RFC4151] and the 'ni' scheme [RFC6920], in names as
   such.  The use of URIs with characters incompatible with this set,
   and possible mapping rules between the two, are outside of the scope
   of the present document.

4.5.2.  Units

   If the Record has no Unit, the Base Unit is used as the Unit.  Having
   no Unit and no Base Unit is allowed; any information that may be

   required about units applicable to the value then needs to be
   provided by the application context.

4.5.3.  Time

   If either the Base Time or Time value is missing, the missing field
   is considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Time and Time values
   are added together to get the time of measurement.

   Values less than 268,435,456 (2**28) represent time relative to the
   current time.  That is, a time of zero indicates that the sensor does
   not know the absolute time and the measurement was made roughly
   "now".  A negative value indicates seconds in the past from roughly
   "now".  Positive values up to 2**28 indicate seconds in the future
   from "now".  Positive values can be used, e.g., for actuation use
   when the desired change should happen in the future but the sender or
   the receiver does not have accurate time available.

   Values greater than or equal to 2**28 represent an absolute time
   relative to the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00Z in UTC time) and the
   time is counted same way as the Portable Operating System Interface
   (POSIX) "seconds since the epoch" [TIME_T].  Therefore the smallest
   absolute time value that can be expressed (2**28) is 1978-07-04
   21:24:16 UTC.

   Because time values up to 2**28 are used for presenting time relative
   to "now" and Time and Base Time are added together, care must be
   taken to ensure that the sum does not inadvertently reach 2**28
   (i.e., absolute time) when relative time was intended to be used.

   Obviously, "now"-referenced SenML records are only useful within a
   specific communication context (e.g., based on information on when
   the SenML pack, or a specific record in a SensML stream, was sent) or
   together with some other context information that can be used for
   deriving a meaning of "now"; the expectation for any archival use is
   that they will be processed into UTC-referenced records before that
   context would cease to be available.  This specification deliberately
   leaves the accuracy of "now" very vague as it is determined by the
   overall systems that use SenML.  In a system where a sensor without
   wall-clock time sends a SenML record with a "now"-referenced time
   over a high speed RS 485 link to an embedded system with accurate
   time that resolves "now" based on the time of reception, the
   resulting time uncertainty could be within 1 ms.  At the other
   extreme, a deployment that sends SenML wind speed readings over a LEO
   satellite link from a mountain valley might have resulting reception
   time values that are easily a dozen minutes off the actual time of
   the sensor reading, with the time uncertainty depending on satellite
   locations and conditions.

4.5.4.  Values

   If only one of the Base Sum or Sum value is present, the missing
   field is considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Sum and Sum
   values are added together to get the sum of measurement.  If neither
   the Base Sum or Sum are present, then the measurement does not have a
   sum value.

   If the Base Value or Value is not present, the missing field(s) are
   considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Value and Value are
   added together to get the value of the measurement.

   Representing the statistical characteristics of measurements, such as
   accuracy, can be very complex.  Future specification may add new
   fields to provide better information about the statistical properties
   of the measurement.

   In summary, the structure of a SenML record is laid out to support a
   single measurement per record.  If multiple data values are measured
   at the same time (e.g., air pressure and altitude), they are best
   kept as separate records linked through their Time value; this is
   even true where one of the data values is more "meta" than others
   (e.g., describes a condition that influences other measurements at
   the same time).

4.6.  Resolved Records

   Sometimes it is useful to be able to refer to a defined normalized
   format for SenML records.  This normalized format tends to get used
   for big data applications and intermediate forms when converting to
   other formats.  Also, if SenML Records are used outside of a SenML
   Pack, they need to be resolved first to ensure applicable base values
   are applied.

   A SenML Record is referred to as "resolved" if it does not contain
   any base values, i.e., labels starting with the character 'b', except
   for Version fields (see below), and has no relative times.  To
   resolve the Records, the applicable base values of the SenML Pack (if
   any) are applied to the Record.  That is, for the base values in the
   Record or before the Record in the Pack, name and base name are
   concatenated, base time is added to the time of the Record, if the
   Record did not contain Unit the Base Unit is applied to the record,
   etc.  In addition the records need to be in chronological order in
   the Pack.  An example of this is shown in Section 5.1.4.

   The Version field MUST NOT be present in resolved records if the
   SenML version defined in this document is used and MUST be present
   otherwise in all the resolved SenML Records.

Internet-Draft                    SenML                         May 2018


   Future specification that defines new base fields need to specify how
   the field is resolved.

4.7.  Associating Meta-data

   SenML is designed to carry the minimum dynamic information about
   measurements, and for efficiency reasons does not carry significant
   static meta-data about the device, object or sensors.  Instead, it is
   assumed that this meta-data is carried out of band.  For web
   resources using SenML Packs, this meta-data can be made available
   using the CoRE Link Format [RFC6690].  The most obvious use of this
   link format is to describe that a resource is available in a SenML
   format in the first place.  The relevant media type indicator is
   included in the Content-Type (ct=) link attribute (which is defined
   for the Link Format in Section 7.2.1 of [RFC7252]).

4.8.  Sensor Streaming Measurement Lists (SensML)

   In some usage scenarios of SenML, the implementations store or
   transmit SenML in a stream-like fashion, where data is collected over
   time and continuously added to the object.  This mode of operation is
   optional, but systems or protocols using SenML in this fashion MUST
   specify that they are doing this.  SenML defines separate media types
   to indicate Sensor Streaming Measurement Lists (SensML) for this
   usage (see Section 12.3.2).  In this situation, the SensML stream can
   be sent and received in a partial fashion, i.e., a measurement entry
   can be read as soon as the SenML Record is received and does not have
   to wait for the full SensML Stream to be complete.

   If times relative to "now" (see Section 4.5.3) are used in SenML
   Records of a SensML stream, their interpretation of "now" is based on
   the time when the specific Record is sent in the stream.

4.9.  Configuration and Actuation usage

   SenML can also be used for configuring parameters and controlling
   actuators.  When a SenML Pack is sent (e.g., using a HTTP/CoAP POST
   or PUT method) and the semantics of the target are such that SenML is
   interpreted as configuration/actuation, SenML Records are interpreted
   as a request to change the values of given (sub)resources (given as
   names) to given values at the given time(s).  The semantics of the
   target resource supporting this usage can be described, e.g., using
   [I-D.ietf-core-interfaces].  Examples of actuation usage are shown in
   Section 5.1.7.

5.  JSON Representation (application/senml+json)

   For the SenML fields shown in Table 2, the SenML labels are used as
   the JSON object member names within JSON objects representing the
   JSON SenML Records.

                    +---------------+-------+---------+

                        Table 2: JSON SenML Labels

   The root JSON value consists of an array with one JSON object for
   each SenML Record.  All the fields in the above table MAY occur in
   the records with member values of the type specified in the table.

   Only the UTF-8 [RFC3629] form of JSON is allowed.  Characters in the
   String Value are encoded using the escape sequences defined in
   [RFC8259].  Octets in the Data Value are base64 encoded with URL safe
   alphabet as defined in Section 5 of [RFC4648], with padding omitted.

   Systems receiving measurements MUST be able to process the range of
   floating point numbers that are representable as an IEEE double
   precision floating point numbers [IEEE.754.1985].  This allows time
   values to have better than microsecond precision over the next 100
   years.  The number of significant digits in any measurement is not
   relevant, so a reading of 1.1 has exactly the same semantic meaning
   as 1.10.  If the value has an exponent, the "e" MUST be in lower
   case.  In the interest of avoiding unnecessary verbosity and speeding
   up processing, the mantissa SHOULD be less than 19 characters long
   and the exponent SHOULD be less than 5 characters long.

   temperature set point, a switch to turn on and off the heat, and a
   switch to turn on the fan override.

   In the following example two different lights are turned on.  It is
   assumed that the lights are on a network that can guarantee delivery
   of the messages to the two lights within 15 ms (e.g. a network using
   802.1BA [IEEE802.1ba-2011] and 802.1AS [IEEE802.1as-2011] for time
   synchronization).  The controller has set the time of the lights
   coming on to 20 ms in the future from the current time.  This allows
   both lights to receive the message, wait till that time, then apply
   the switch command so that both lights come on at the same time.

     {"n":"2001:db8::4","v":1}
   ]

   The following shows two lights being turned off using a non
   deterministic network that has a high odds of delivering a message in
   less than 100 ms and uses NTP for time synchronization.  The current
   time is 1320078429.  The user has just turned off a light switch
   which is turning off two lights.  Both lights are dimmed to 50%
   brightness immediately to give the user instant feedback that
   something is changing.  However given the network, the lights will
   probably dim at somewhat different times.  Then 100 ms in the future,
   both lights will go off at the same time.  The instant but not
   synchronized dimming gives the user the sensation of quick responses
   and the timed off 100 ms in the future gives the perception of both
   lights going off at the same time.

6.  CBOR Representation (application/senml+cbor)

   The CBOR [RFC7049] representation is equivalent to the JSON
   representation, with the following changes:

   o  For JSON Numbers, the CBOR representation can use integers,
      floating point numbers, or decimal fractions (CBOR Tag 4); however
      a representation SHOULD be chosen such that when the CBOR value is
      converted back to an IEEE double precision floating point value,
      it has exactly the same value as the original Number.  For the
      version number, only an unsigned integer is allowed.

   o  Characters in the String Value are encoded using a definite length
      text string (type 3).  Octets in the Data Value are encoded using
      a definite length byte string (type 2).

   o  For compactness, the CBOR representation uses integers for the
      labels, as defined in Table 4.  This table is conclusive, i.e.,
      there is no intention to define any additional integer map keys;
      any extensions will use string map keys.  This allows translators
      converting between CBOR and JSON representations to convert also
      all future labels without needing to update implementations.  The
      base values are given negative CBOR labels and others non-negative
      labels.

7.  XML Representation (application/senml+xml)

   A SenML Pack or Stream can also be represented in XML format as
   defined in this section.

   Only the UTF-8 form of XML is allowed.  Characters in the String
   Value are encoded using the escape sequences defined in [RFC8259].
   Octets in the Data Value are base64 encoded with URL safe alphabet as
   defined in Section 5 of [RFC4648].

8.  EXI Representation (application/senml-exi)

   For efficient transmission of SenML over e.g. a constrained network,
   Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) can be used.  This encodes the XML
   Schema [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] structure of SenML into binary
   tags and values rather than ASCII text.  An EXI representation of
   SenML SHOULD be made using the strict schema-mode of EXI.  This mode
   however does not allow tag extensions to the schema, and therefore
   any extensions will be lost in the encoding.  For uses where
   extensions need to be preserved in EXI, the non-strict schema mode of
   EXI MAY be used.

   The EXI header MUST include an "EXI Options", as defined in
   [W3C.REC-exi-20140211], with an schemaId set to the value of "a"
   indicating the schema provided in this specification.  Future
   revisions to the schema can change the value of the schemaId to allow
   for backwards compatibility.  When the data will be transported over
   CoAP or HTTP, an EXI Cookie SHOULD NOT be used as it simply makes

   Content-Type header.

   The following is the XSD Schema to be used for strict schema guided
   EXI processing.  It is generated from the RelaxNG.

   Which compresses with EXI to the following displayed in hexdump:

 0000 a0 30 0d 84 80 f3 ab 93 71 d3 23 2b b1 d3 7b b9 |.0......q.#+..{.|

 003f

   The above example used the bit packed form of EXI but it is also
   possible to use a byte packed form of EXI which can makes it easier
   for a simple sensor to produce valid EXI without really implementing
   EXI.  Consider the example of a temperature sensor that produces a
   value in tenths of degrees Celsius over a range of 0.0 to 55.0.  It
   would produce an XML SenML file such as:

   <sensml xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:senml">
     <senml n="urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" u="Cel" v="23.1"></senml>
   </sensml>

   The compressed form, using the byte alignment option of EXI, for the
   above XML is the following:

 0000 a0 00 48 80 6c 20 01 06 1d 75 72 6e 3a 64 65 76 |..H.l ...urn:dev|
 0010 3a 6f 77 3a 31 30 65 32 30 37 33 61 30 31 30 38 |:ow:10e2073a0108|
 0020 30 30 36 33 02 05 43 65 6c 01 00 e7 01 01 00 03 |0063..Cel.......|
 0030 01                                              |.|
 0031

   A small temperature sensor device that only generates this one EXI
   file does not really need a full EXI implementation.  It can simply
   hard code the output replacing the 1-wire device ID starting at byte
   0x14 and going to byte 0x23 with its device ID, and replacing the
   value "0xe7 0x01" at location 0x31 and 0x32 with the current
   temperature.  The EXI Specification [W3C.REC-exi-20140211] contains
   the full information on how floating point numbers are represented,
   but for the purpose of this sensor, the temperature can be converted
   to an integer in tenths of degrees (231 in this example).  EXI stores
   7 bits of the integer in each byte with the top bit set to one if
   there are further bytes.  So the first bytes at is set to low 7 bits
   of the integer temperature in tenths of degrees plus 0x80.  In this
   example 231 & 0x7F + 0x80 = 0xE7.  The second byte is set to the
   integer temperature in tenths of degrees right shifted 7 bits.  In
   this example 231 >> 7 = 0x01.

9.  Fragment Identification Methods

   A SenML Pack typically consists of multiple SenML Records and for
   some applications it may be useful to be able to refer with a
   Fragment Identifier to a single record, or a set of records, in a
   Pack.  The fragment identifier is only interpreted by a client and
   does not impact retrieval of a representation.  The SenML Fragment
   Identification is modeled after CSV Fragment Identifiers [RFC7111].

   To select a single SenML Record, the "rec" scheme followed by a
   single number is used.  For the purpose of numbering records, the
   first record is at position 1.  A range of records can be selected by
   giving the first and the last record number separated by a '-'
   character.  Instead of the second number, the '*' character can be
   used to indicate the last SenML Record in the Pack.  A set of records
   can also be selected using a comma separated list of record positions
   or ranges.

   (We use the term "selecting a record" for identifying it as part of
   the fragment, not in the sense of isolating it from the Pack -- the
   record still needs to be interpreted as part of the Pack, e.g., using
   the base values defined in earlier records)

9.1.  Fragment Identification Examples

   The 3rd SenML Record from "coap://example.com/temp" resource can be
   selected with:

9.2.  Fragment Identification for the XML and EXI Formats

   In addition to the SenML Fragment Identifiers described above, with
   the XML and EXI SenML formats also the syntax defined in the XPointer
   element() Scheme [XPointerElement] of the XPointer Framework
   [XPointerFramework] can be used.  (This is required by [RFC7303] for
   media types using the "+xml" structured syntax suffix.  SenML allows
   this for the EXI formats as well for consistency.)

   Note that fragment identifiers are available to the client side only;
   they are not provided in transfer protocols such as CoAP or HTTP.
   Thus, they cannot be used by the server in deciding which media type
   to send.  Where a server has multiple representations available for a
   resource identified by a URI, it might send a JSON or CBOR
   representation when the client was directed to use an XML/EXI
   fragment identifier with this.  Clients can prevent running into this
   problem by explicitly requesting an XML or EXI media type (e.g.,
   using the CoAP Accept option) when XML/EXI-only fragment identifier
   syntax is in use in the URI.

10.  Usage Considerations

   The measurements support sending both the current value of a sensor
   as well as an integrated sum.  For many types of measurements, the
   sum is more useful than the current value.  For historical reasons,
   this field is called "sum" instead of "integral" which would more
   accurately describe its function.  For example, an electrical meter
   that measures the energy a given computer uses will typically want to
   measure the cumulative amount of energy used.  This is less prone to
   error than reporting the power each second and trying to have
   something on the server side sum together all the power measurements.
   If the network between the sensor and the meter goes down over some
   period of time, when it comes back up, the cumulative sum helps
   reflect what happened while the network was down.  A meter like this
   would typically report a measurement with the unit set to watts, but
   it would put the sum of energy used in the "s" field of the
   measurement.  It might optionally include the current power in the
   "v" field.

   While the benefit of using the integrated sum is fairly clear for
   measurements like power and energy, it is less obvious for something
   like temperature.  Reporting the sum of the temperature makes it easy
   to compute averages even when the individual temperature values are
   not reported frequently enough to compute accurate averages.
   Implementers are encouraged to report the cumulative sum as well as
   the raw value of a given sensor.

   Applications that use the cumulative sum values need to understand
   they are very loosely defined by this specification, and depending on
   the particular sensor implementation may behave in unexpected ways.
   Applications should be able to deal with the following issues:

   1.  Many sensors will allow the cumulative sums to "wrap" back to
       zero after the value gets sufficiently large.

   2.  Some sensors will reset the cumulative sum back to zero when the
       device is reset, loses power, or is replaced with a different
       sensor.

   3.  Applications cannot make assumptions about when the device
       started accumulating values into the sum.

   Typically applications can make some assumptions about specific
   sensors that will allow them to deal with these problems.  A common
   assumption is that for sensors whose measurement values are always
   positive, the sum should never get smaller; so if the sum does get
   smaller, the application will know that one of the situations listed
   above has happened.

   Despite the name sum, the sum field is not useful for applications
   that maintain a running count of the number of times that an event
   happened or keeping track of a counter such as the total number of
   bytes sent on an interface.  Data like that can be sent directly in
   the value field.

11.  CDDL

   As a convenient reference, the JSON and CBOR representations can be
   described with the common CDDL [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl] specification in
   Figure 1 (informative).

12.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA" with
   the RFC number of this specification.

   IANA will create a new registry for "Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)
   Parameters".  The sub-registries defined in Section 12.1 and
   Section 12.2 will be created inside this registry.

12.1.  Units Registry

   IANA will create a registry of SenML unit symbols.  The primary
   purpose of this registry is to make sure that symbols uniquely map to
   give type of measurement.  Definitions for many of these units can be
   found in location such as [NIST811] and [BIPM].  Units marked with an
   asterisk are NOT RECOMMENDED to be produced by new implementations,
   but are in active use and SHOULD be implemented by consumers that can
   use the related base units.

   o  Note 2: A value of 0.0 indicates the switch is off while 1.0

      provided for the same unit - but note that while that name
      strongly suggests a percentage (0..100) -- it is however NOT a
      percentage, but the absolute ratio!

   New entries can be added to the registration by Expert Review as
   defined in [RFC8126].  Experts should exercise their own good
   judgment but need to consider the following guidelines:

   1.   There needs to be a real and compelling use for any new unit to
        be added.

   2.   Each unit should define the semantic information and be chosen
        carefully.  Implementers need to remember that the same word may
        be used in different real-life contexts.  For example, degrees
        when measuring latitude have no semantic relation to degrees
        when measuring temperature; thus two different units are needed.

   3.   These measurements are produced by computers for consumption by
        computers.  The principle is that conversion has to be easily be
        done when both reading and writing the media type.  The value of
        a single canonical representation outweighs the convenience of
        easy human representations or loss of precision in a conversion.

   4.   Use of SI prefixes such as "k" before the unit is not
        recommended.  Instead one can represent the value using
        scientific notation such a 1.2e3.  The "kg" unit is exception to
        this rule since it is an SI base unit; the "g" unit is provided
        for legacy compatibility.

   5.   For a given type of measurement, there will only be one unit
        type defined.  So for length, meters are defined and other




Jennings, et al.        Expires November 19, 2018              [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                    SenML                         May 2018


        lengths such as mile, foot, light year are not allowed.  For
        most cases, the SI unit is preferred.

        (Note that some amount of judgment will be required here, as
        even SI itself is not entirely consistent in this respect.  For
        instance, for temperature [ISO-80000-5] defines a quantity, item
        5-1 (thermodynamic temperature), and a corresponding unit 5-1.a
        (Kelvin), and then goes ahead to define another quantity right
        besides that, item 5-2 ("Celsius temperature"), and the
        corresponding unit 5-2.a (degree Celsius).  The latter quantity
        is defined such that it gives the thermodynamic temperature as a
        delta from T0 = 275.15 K.  ISO 80000-5 is defining both units
        side by side, and not really expressing a preference.  This
        level of recognition of the alternative unit degree Celsius is
        the reason why Celsius temperatures exceptionally seem
        acceptable in the SenML units list alongside Kelvin.)

   6.   Symbol names that could be easily confused with existing common
        units or units combined with prefixes should be avoided.  For
        example, selecting a unit name of "mph" to indicate something
        that had nothing to do with velocity would be a bad choice, as
        "mph" is commonly used to mean miles per hour.

   7.   The following should not be used because the are common SI
        prefixes: Y, Z, E, P, T, G, M, k, h, da, d, c, n, u, p, f, a, z,
        y, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi, Ei, Zi, Yi.

   8.   The following units should not be used as they are commonly used
        to represent other measurements Ky, Gal, dyn, etg, P, St, Mx, G,
        Oe, Gb, sb, Lmb, mph, Ci, R, RAD, REM, gal, bbl, qt, degF, Cal,
        BTU, HP, pH, B/s, psi, Torr, atm, at, bar, kWh.

   9.   The unit names are case sensitive and the correct case needs to
        be used, but symbols that differ only in case should not be
        allocated.

   10.  A number after a unit typically indicates the previous unit
        raised to that power, and the / indicates that the units that
        follow are the reciprocal.  A unit should have only one / in the
        name.

   11.  A good list of common units can be found in the Unified Code for
        Units of Measure [UCUM].

   Table 7: IANA Registry for SenML Labels, CL = CBOR Label, EI = EXI ID

   This is the same table as Table 1, with notes removed, and with
   columns added for the information that is all the same for this
   initial set of registrations, but will need to be supplied with a
   different value for new registrations.

   All new entries must define the Label Name, Label, and XML Type but
   the CBOR labels SHOULD be left empty as CBOR will use the string
   encoding for any new labels.  The EI column contains the EXI schemaId
   value of the first Schema which includes this label or is empty if
   this label was not intended for use with EXI.  The Note field SHOULD
   contain information about where to find out more information about
   this label.

   The JSON, CBOR, and EXI types are derived from the XML type.  All XML
   numeric types such as double, float, integer and int become a JSON
   Number.  XML boolean and string become a JSON Boolean and String
   respectively.  CBOR represents numeric values with a CBOR type that
   does not lose any information from the JSON value.  EXI uses the XML
   types.

   New entries can be added to the registration by Expert Review as
   defined in [RFC8126].  Experts should exercise their own good
   judgment but need to consider that shorter labels should have more
   strict review.  New entries should not be made that counteract the
   advice at the end of Section 4.5.4.

   All new SenML labels that have "base" semantics (see Section 4.1)
   MUST start with the character 'b'.  Regular labels MUST NOT start
   with that character.  All new SenML labels with Value semantics (see
   Section 4.2) MUST have "Value" in their (long form) name.

   Extensions that add a label that is intended for use with XML need to
   create a new RelaxNG scheme that includes all the labels in the IANA
   registry.

   Extensions that add a label that is intended for use with EXI need to
   create a new XSD Schema that includes all the labels in the IANA
   registry and then allocate a new EXI schemaId value.  Moving to the
   next letter in the alphabet is the suggested way to create the new
   value for the EXI schemaId.  Any labels with previously blank ID
   values SHOULD be updated in the IANA table to have their ID set to
   this new schemaId value.

   Extensions that are mandatory to understand to correctly process the
   Pack MUST have a label name that ends with the '_' character.

12.3.  Media Type Registrations

   The following registrations are done following the procedure
   specified in [RFC6838] and [RFC7303].  This document registers media
   types for each serialization format of SenML (JSON, CBOR, XML, and
   EXI) and also a corresponding set of media types for the streaming
   use (SensML, see Section 4.8).  Clipboard formats are defined for the
   JSON and XML forms of SenML but not for streams or non-textual
   formats.

   The reason there are both SenML and the streaming SensML formats is
   that they are not the same data formats and they require separate
   negotiation to understand if they are supported and which one is
   being used.  The non streaming format is required to have some sort
   of end of pack syntax which indicates there will be no more records.
   Many implementations that receive SenML wait for this end of pack
   marker before processing any of the records.  On the other hand, with
   the streaming formats, it is explicitly not required to wait for this
   end of pack marker.  Many implementations that produce streaming
   SensML will never send this end of pack marker so implementations
   that receive streaming SensML can not wait for the end of pack marker
   before they start processing the records.  Given the SenML and

   streaming SenML are different data formats, and the requirement for
   separate negotiation, a media type for each one is needed.

   Note to RFC Editor - please remove this paragraph.  Note that a
   request for media type review for senml+json was sent to the media-
   types@iana.org on Sept 21, 2010.  A second request for all the types
   was sent on October 31, 2016.  Please change all instances of RFC-
   AAAA with the RFC number of this document.

12.3.1.  senml+json Media Type Registration

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: senml+json

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using a subset of the
   encoding allowed in [RFC8259].  See RFC-AAAA for details.  This
   simplifies implementation of very simple system and does not impose
   any significant limitations as all this data is meant for machine to
   machine communications and is not meant to be human readable.

   Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC-AAAA.

   Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any JSON
   key value pairs that they do not understand unless the key ends with
   the '_' character in which case an error MUST be generated.  This
   allows backwards compatible extensions to this specification.  The
   "bver" field can be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal
   level of functionality needed by the creator of the JSON object.

   Published specification: RFC-AAAA

   Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
   that report e.g., electrical power usage and environmental
   information such as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a
   wide range of sensor reporting systems.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
   application/senml+json is supported by using fragment identifiers as
   specified by RFC-AAAA.

13.  Security Considerations

   Sensor data presented with SenML can contain a wide range of
   information ranging from information that is very public, such as the
   outside temperature in a given city, to very private information that
   requires integrity and confidentiality protection, such as patient
   health information.  When SenML is used for configuration or
   actuation, it can be used to change the state of systems and also
   impact the physical world, e.g., by turning off a heater or opening a
   lock.

   The SenML formats alone do not provide any security and instead rely
   on the protocol that carries them to provide security.  Applications
   using SenML need to look at the overall context of how these formats
   will be used to decide if the security is adequate.  In particular
   for sensitive sensor data and actuation use it is important to ensure
   that proper security mechanisms are used to provide, e.g.,
   confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication as appropriate
   for the usage.

   The SenML formats defined by this specification do not contain any
   executable content.  However, future extensions could potentially
   embed application specific executable content in the data.

   SenML Records are intended to be interpreted in the context of any
   applicable base values.  If records become separated from the record
   that establishes the base values, the data will be useless or, worse,
   wrong.  Care needs to be taken in keeping the integrity of a Pack
   that contains unresolved SenML Records (see Section 4.6).

   See also Section 14.

Internet-Draft                    SenML                         May 2018


14.  Privacy Considerations

   Sensor data can range from information with almost no privacy
   considerations, such as the current temperature in a given city, to
   highly sensitive medical or location data.  This specification
   provides no security protection for the data but is meant to be used
   inside another container or transfer protocol such as S/MIME
   [RFC5751] or HTTP with TLS [RFC2818] that can provide integrity,
   confidentiality, and authentication information about the source of
   the data.

   The name fields need to uniquely identify the sources or destinations
   of the values in a SenML Pack.  However, the use of long-term stable
   unique identifiers can be problematic for privacy reasons [RFC6973],
   depending on the application and the potential of these identifiers
   to be used in correlation with other information.  They should be
   used with care or avoided as for example described for IPv6 addresses
   in [RFC7721].
