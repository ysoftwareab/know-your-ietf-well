1.  Introduction

   This document describes the usage of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) [RFC7230] for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).
   The goal of this document is to tie together usage patterns of HTTP
   into a common profile applicable to the various types of directory
   services serving registration data using practices informed by the
   Representational State Transfer REST [REST] architectural style.  By
   giving the various directory services common behavior, a single

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                November 2014


   client is better able to retrieve data from directory services
   adhering to this behavior.

   Registration data expected to be presented by this service is
   Internet resource registration data - registration of domain names
   and Internet number resources.  This data is typically provided by
   WHOIS [RFC3912] services, but the WHOIS protocol is insufficient to
   modern registration data service requirements.  A replacement
   protocol is expected to retain the simple transactional nature of
   WHOIS, while providing a specification for queries and responses,
   redirection to authoritative sources, support for Internationalized
   Domain Names (IDNs, [RFC5890]), and support for localized
   registration data such as addresses and organisation or person names.

   In designing these common usage patterns, this document introduces
   considerations for a simple use of HTTP.  Where complexity may
   reside, it is the goal of this document to place it upon the server
   and to keep the client as simple as possible.  A client
   implementation should be possible using common operating system
   scripting tools (e.g. bash and wget).

   This is the basic usage pattern for this protocol:

   1.  A client determines an appropriate server to query along with the
       appropriate base Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to use in such
       queries.  [I-D.ietf-weirds-bootstrap] describes one method to
       determine the server and the base URL.  See Appendix C for more
       information.

   2.  A client issues an HTTP (or HTTPS) query using GET [RFC7231].  As
       an example, a query URL for the network registration 192.0.2.0
       might be

          http://example.com/rdap/ip/192.0.2.0

       [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query] details the various queries used in
       RDAP.

   3.  If the receiving server has the information for the query, it
       examines the Accept header field of the query and returns a 200
       response with a response entity appropriate for the requested
       format.  [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response] details a response in
       JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

   4.  If the receiving server does not have the information for the
       query but does have knowledge of where the information can be
       found, it will return a redirection response (3xx) with the
       Location: header field containing an HTTP(S) URL pointing to the



Newton, et al.            Expires May 23, 2015                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                November 2014


       information or another server known to have knowledge of the
       location of the information.  The client is expected to re-query
       using that HTTP URL.

   5.  If the receiving server does not have the information being
       requested and does not have knowledge of where the information
       can be found, it returns a 404 response.

   6.  If the receiving server will not answer a request for policy
       reasons, it will return an error response (4xx) indicating the
       reason for giving no answer.

   It is not the intent of this document to redefine the meaning and
   semantics of HTTP.  The purpose of this document is to clarify the
   use of standard HTTP mechanisms for this application.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   As is noted in Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
   Report on WHOIS Terminology and Structure [SAC-051], the term "WHOIS"
   is overloaded, often referring to a protocol, a service and data.  In
   accordance with [SAC-051], this document describes the base behavior
   for a Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).  [SAC-051] describes
   a protocol profile of RDAP for Domain Name Registries (DNRs), the
   Domain Name Registration Data Access Protocol (DNRD-AP).

   In this document, an RDAP client is an HTTP user agent performing an
   RDAP query, and an RDAP server is an HTTP server providing an RDAP
   response.  RDAP query and response formats are described in
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query] and [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response],
   while this document describes how RDAP clients and servers use HTTP
   to exchange queries and responses.  [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-sec]
   describes security considerations for RDAP.

3.  Design Intents

   There are a few design criteria this document attempts to meet.

   First, each query is meant to require only one path of execution to
   obtain an answer.  A response may contain an answer, no answer, or a
   redirect, and clients are not expected to fork multiple paths of
   execution to make a query.

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                November 2014


   Second, the semantics of the request/response allow for future and/or
   non-standard response formats.  In this document, only a JSON
   [RFC7159] response media type is noted, with the response contents to
   be described separately (see [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response]).  This
   document only describes how RDAP is transported using HTTP with this
   format.

   Third, this protocol is intended to be able to make use of the range
   of mechanisms available for use with HTTP.  HTTP offers a number of
   mechanisms not described further in this document.  Operators are
   able to make use of these mechanisms according to their local policy,
   including cache control, authorization, compression, and redirection.
   HTTP also benefits from widespread investment in scalability,
   reliability, and performance, and widespread programmer understanding
   of client behaviours for web services styled after REST [REST],
   reducing the cost to deploy Registration Data Directory Services and
   clients.  This protocol is forward compatible with HTTP 2.0.

4.  Queries

4.1.  HTTP Methods

   Clients use the GET method to retrieve a response body and use the
   HEAD method to determine existence of data on the server.  Clients
   SHOULD use either the HTTP GET or HEAD methods (see [RFC7231]).
   Servers are under no obligation to support other HTTP methods,
   therefore clients using other methods will likely not interoperate
   properly.

   Clients and servers MUST support HTTPS to support security services.

4.2.  Accept Header

   To indicate to servers that an RDAP response is desired, clients
   include an Accept: header field with an RDAP specific JSON media
   type, the generic JSON media type, or both.  Servers receiving an
   RDAP request return an entity with a Content-Type: header containing
   the RDAP specific JSON media type.

   This specification does not define the responses a server returns to
   a request with any other media types in the Accept: header field, or
   with no Accept: header field.  One possibility would be to return a
   response in a media type suitable for rendering in a web browser.

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                November 2014


4.3.  Query Parameters

   Servers MUST ignore unknown query parameters.  Use of unknown query
   parameters for cache-busting is described in Appendix B.

5.  Types of HTTP Response

   This section describes the various types of responses a server may
   send to a client.  While no standard HTTP response code is forbidden
   in usage, this section defines the minimal set of response codes in
   common use by servers that a client will need to understand.  While
   some clients may be constructed with simple tooling that does not
   account for all of these response codes, a more robust client
   accounting for these codes will likely provide a better user
   experience.  It is expected that usage of response codes and types
   for this application not defined here will be described in subsequent
   documents.

5.1.  Positive Answers

   If a server has the information requested by the client and wishes to
   respond to the client with the information according to its policies,
   it returns that answer in the body of a 200 (OK) response (see
   [RFC7231]).

5.2.  Redirects

   If a server wishes to inform a client that the answer to a given
   query can be found elsewhere, it returns either a 301 (Moved
   Permanently) response code to indicate a permanent move, or a 302
   (Found), 303 (See Other) or 307 (Temporary Redirect) response code to
   indicate a non-permanent redirection, and it includes an HTTP(s) URL
   in the Location: header field (see [RFC7231]).  The client is
   expected to issue a subsequent request to satisfy the original query
   using the given URL without any processing of the URL.  In other
   words, the server is to hand back a complete URL and the client
   should not have to transform the URL to follow it.  Servers are under
   no obligation to return a URL conformant to
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].

   For this application, such an example of a permanent move might be a
   Top Level Domain (TLD) operator informing a client the information
   being sought can be found with another TLD operator (i.e. a query for
   the domain bar in foo.example is found at http://foo.example/domain/
   bar).

   For example, if the client uses

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                November 2014


      http://serv1.example.com/weirds/domain/example.com

   the server redirecting to

      https://serv2.example.net/weirds2/

   would set the Location: field to the value

      https://serv2.example.net/weirds2/domain/example.com

5.3.  Negative Answers

   If a server wishes to respond that it has an empty result set (that
   is, no data appropriately satisfying the query), it returns a 404
   (Not Found) response code.  Optionally, it MAY include additional
   information regarding the negative answer in the HTTP entity body.

   If a server wishes to inform the client that information about the
   query is available, but cannot include the information in the
   response to the client for policy reasons, the server MUST respond
   with an appropriate response code out of HTTP's 4xx range.  A client
   MAY retry the query if that is appropriate for the respective
   response code.

5.4.  Malformed Queries

   If a server receives a query which it cannot interpret as an RDAP
   query, it returns a 400 (Bad Request) response code.  Optionally, it
   MAY include additional information regarding this negative answer in
   the HTTP entity body.

5.5.  Rate Limits

   Some servers apply rate limits to deter address scraping and other
   abuses.  When a server declines to answer a query due to rate limits,
   it returns a 429 (Too Many Requests) response code as described in
   [RFC6585].  A client that receives a 429 response SHOULD decrease its
   query rate, and honor the Retry-After header field if one is present.
   Servers may place stricter limits upon clients that do not honor the
   Retry-After header.  Optionally, the server MAY include additional
   information regarding the rate limiting in the HTTP entity body.

   Note that this is not a defense against denial-of-service attacks,
   since a malicious client could ignore the code and continue to send
   queries at a high rate.  A server might use another response code if
   it did not wish to reveal to a client that rate limiting is the
   reason for the denial of a reply.

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                November 2014


5.6.  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

   When responding to queries, it is RECOMMENDED that servers use the
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin header field, as specified by
   [W3C.CR-cors-20130129].  A value of "*" is suitable when RDAP is used
   for public resources.

   This header (often called the CORS header) helps in-browser web
   applications by lifting the "same-origin" restriction (i.e. a browser
   may load RDAP client code from one web server but query others for
   RDAP data).

   By default, browsers do not send cookies when cross origin requests
   are allowed.  Setting the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header to
   "true" will send cookies.  Use of the Access-Control-Allow-
   Credentials is NOT RECOMMENDED.

6.  Extensibility

   For extensibility purposes, this document defines an IANA registry
   for prefixes used in JSON [RFC7159] data serialization and URI path
   segments (see Section 8).

   Prefixes and identifiers SHOULD only consist of the alphabetic ASCII
   characters A through Z in both uppercase and lowercase, the numerical
   digits 0 through 9, underscore characters, and SHOULD NOT begin with
   an underscore character, numerical digit or the characters "xml".
   The following describes the production of JSON names in ABNF
   [RFC5234].

   ABNF for JSON names


     name = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" )


                                 Figure 1

   This restriction is a union of the Ruby programming language
   identifier syntax and the XML element name syntax and has two
   purposes.  First, client implementers using modern programming
   languages such as Ruby or Java can use libraries that automatically
   promote JSON names to first order object attributes or members.
   Second, a clean mapping between JSON and XML is easy to accomplish
   using these rules.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not pose strong security requirements to the RDAP
   protocol.  However, it does not restrict against the use of security
   mechanisms offered by the HTTP protocol.  It does require that RDAP
   clients and server MUST support HTTPS.

   This document makes recommendations for server implementations
   against denial-of-service (Section 5.5) and interoperability with
   existing security mechanism in HTTP clients (Section 5.6).

   Additional security considerations to the RDAP protocol are covered
   in [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-sec].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  RDAP Extensions Registry

   This section requests that the IANA create a new category in the
   protocol registries labeled "Registration Data Access Protocol
   (RDAP)" (if it does not already exist), and within that category
   establish a URL referenceable, stand-alone registry labeled "RDAP
   Extensions".  The purpose of this registry is to ensure uniqueness of
   extension identifiers.  The extension identifier is used as a prefix
   in JSON names and as a prefix of path segments in RDAP URLs.

   The production rule for these identifiers is specified in Section 6.

   In accordance with [RFC5226], the IANA policy for assigning new
   values shall be Specification Required: values and their meanings
   must be documented in an RFC or in some other permanent and readily
   available reference, in sufficient detail that interoperability
   between independent implementations is possible.

   The following is a preliminary template for an RDAP extension
   registration:

      Extension identifier: the identifier of the extension

      Registry operator: the name of the registry operator

      Published specification: RFC number, bibliographical reference or
      URL to a permanent and readily available specification

      Person & email address to contact for further information: The
      names and email addresses of individuals for contact regarding
      this registry entry

      Intended usage: brief reasons for this registry entry (as defined
      by [RFC5226].

   The following is an example of a registration in the RDAP extension
   registry:

      Extension identifier: lunarNic

      Registry operator: The Registry of the Moon, LLC

      Published specification: http://www.example/moon_apis/rdap

      Person & email address to contact for further information:
      Professor Bernardo de la Paz <berny@moon.example>

      Intended usage: COMMON

9.  Internationalization Considerations

9.1.  URIs and IRIs

   Clients can use IRIs [RFC3987] for internal use as they see fit, but
   MUST transform them to URIs [RFC3986] for interaction with RDAP
   servers.  RDAP servers MUST use URIs in all responses, and again
   clients can transform these URIs to IRIs for internal use as they see
   fit.

9.2.  Language Identifiers in Queries and Responses

   Under most scenarios, clients requesting data will not signal that
   the data be returned in a particular language or script.  On the
   other hand, when servers return data and have knowledge that the data
   is in a language or script, the data SHOULD be annotated with
   language identifiers whenever they are available, thus allowing
   clients to process and display the data accordingly.

   [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response] provides such a mechanism.

9.3.  Language Identifiers in HTTP Headers

   Given the description of the use of language identifiers in
   Section 9.2, unless otherwise specified, servers SHOULD ignore the
   HTTP [RFC7231] Accept-Language header field when formulating HTTP
   entity responses, so that clients do not conflate the Accept-Language
   header with the 'lang' values in the entity body.

   However, servers MAY return language identifiers in the Content-
   Language header field so as to inform clients of the intended
   language of HTTP layer messages.

Appendix A.  Protocol Example

   To demonstrate typical behaviour of an RDAP client and server, the
   following is an example of an exchange, including a redirect.  The
   data in the response has been elided for brevity, as the data format
   is not described in this document.  The media type used here is
   described in [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].

   An example of an RDAP client and server exchange:


     Client:
         <TCP connect to rdap.example.com port 80>
         GET /rdap/ip/203.0.113.0/24 HTTP/1.1
         Host: rdap.example.com
         Accept: application/rdap+json

     rdap.example.com:
         HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
         Location: http://rdap-ip.example.com/rdap/ip/203.0.113.0/24
         Content-Length: 0
         Content-Type: application/rdap+json
         <TCP disconnect>

     Client:
         <TCP connect to rdap-ip.example.com port 80>
         GET /rdap/ip/203.0.113.0/24 HTTP/1.1
         Host:  rdap-ip.example.com
         Accept: application/rdap+json

     rdap-ip.example.com:
         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Content-Type: application/rdap+json
         Content-Length: 9001

         { ... }
         <TCP disconnect>


Appendix B.  Cache Busting

   Some HTTP [RFC7230] cache infrastructure does not adhere to caching
   standards adequately, and could cache responses longer than is
   intended by the server.  To overcome these issues, clients can use an
   adhoc and improbably used query parameter with a random value of
   their choosing.  As Section 4.3 instructs servers to ignore unknown
   parameters, this is compatible with the RDAP definition.

   An example of using an unknown query parameter to bust caches:


     http://example.com/ip/192.0.2.0?__fuhgetaboutit=xyz123

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                November 2014


   Use of an unknown parameter to overcome misbehaving caches is not
   part of any specification and is offered here for informational
   purposes.

Appendix C.  Bootstrapping and Redirection

   The traditional deployment model of WHOIS [RFC3912] does not provide
   a mechanism for determining the authoritative source for information.

   Some approaches have been implemented in the past, most notably the
   Joint WHOIS [lacnic-joint-whois] initiative.  However, among other
   shortcomings, Joint WHOIS is implemented using proxies and server-
   side referrals.

   These issues are solved in RDAP using HTTP redirects and
   bootstrapping.  Bootstrapping is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-bootstrap].  In constrained environments, the
   processes outlined in [I-D.ietf-weirds-bootstrap] may not be viable
   and there may be need for servers acting as a "redirector".

   Redirector servers issue HTTP redirects to clients using a
   redirection table informed by [I-D.ietf-weirds-bootstrap].  Figure 2
   diagrams a client using a redirector for bootstrapping.

   In some cases, particularly sub-delegations made between RIRs known
   as "ERX space" and transfers of networks, multiple HTTP redirects
   will be issued.  Figure 3 shows such a scenario.
