Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Control Framework [SIPCF] provides a generic approach for
   establishment and reporting capabilities of remotely initiated
   commands.  The Framework utilizes many functions provided by the
   Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261] (SIP) for the rendezvous and
   establishment of a reliable channel for control interactions.  The
   Control Framework also introduces the concept of a Control Package.
   A Control Package is an explicit usage of the Control Framework for a
   particular interaction set.

   This specification defines a package for IVR functions using VoiceXML
   dialogs [VXML20].  As a recognized international standard for IVR
   dialogs, VoiceXML is used extensively within media server control
   languages (cf. [MSCP], [CCXML10], [MSML], [RFC4722], [RFC4240]).  To
   ensure interoperability, if a media server supports this package,
   then it MUST support VoiceXML 2.0 dialog scripts.  It MAY support
   later versions of VoiceXML or other dialog script formats.

   The VoiceXML package extends the basic IVR control package
   ([BASICIVRCP]).  The extensions only affect the <dialogprepare> and
   <dialogstart> elements: in particular,

   1.  dialog scripts may also be specified inline using a child <src>
       element

   2.  a type attribute is introduced with the default value
       "application/voicexml+xml"

   3.  HTTP fetching and caching of dialog scripts can be configured
       using attributes of a child <httpparams> element

   Otherwise, this package follows precisely the syntax and semantics of
   the basic IVR control package.

   Other control packages may be defined which extend the capabilities
   of the control package defined in this document.  Such control
   package must respect the syntax and semantics of this control
   package.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".  In addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   The following additional terms are defined for use in this document:

   Dialog:  A dialog performs media interaction with a user.  A dialog
      is identified by a URI and has an associated mimetype.  Dialogs
      typically feature basic capabilities such as playing audio
      prompts, collecting DTMF input and recording audio input from the
      user.  More advanced dialogs may also feature synthesized speech,
      recording and playback of video, recognition of spoken input, and
      mixed initiative conversations.

   Application server:  A SIP [RFC3261] application server (AS) hosts
      and executes services such as interactive media and conferencing
      in an operator's network.  An AS influences and impacts the SIP
      session, in particular by terminating SIP sessions on a media
      server, which is under its control.

   Media Server:  A media server (MS) processes media streams on behalf
      of an AS by offering functionality such as interactive media,
      conferencing, and transcoding to the end user.  Interactive media
      functionality is realized by way of dialogs, which are identified
      by a URI and initiated by the application server.

3.  Control Package Definition

   This section fulfills the mandatory requirement for information that
   MUST be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
   Package, as detailed in Section 9 of [SIPCF].

3.1.  Control Package Name

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify and register a unique name and version.

   The name and version of this Control Package is "msc-ivr-vxml/1.0"
   (Media Server Control - Interactive Voice Response - VoiceXML -
   version 1.0 ).

3.2.  Framework Message Usage

   IVR functionality includes capabilities such as playing prompts,
   collecting DTMF and recording user input.  These functions are
   expressed in VoiceXML dialogs.

   This package defines XML elements in Section 4 and provides an XML
   Schema in Section 5.

   The XML elements in this package are split into requests, responses
   and event notifications.  Requests are carried in CONTROL message
   bodies; <dialogprepare>, <dialogstart> and <dialogterminate> elements
   are defined as package requests.  Responses are carried either in
   REPORT message or Control Framework 200 response bodies; the
   <response> element is defined as a package response.  Event
   notifications are also carried in REPORT message bodies; the <event>
   element is defined for package event notifications.

   Note that package responses are different from framework response
   codes.  Framework error response codes (see Section 8 of [SIPCF]) are
   used when the request or event notification is invalid; for example,
   a request is invalid XML (400), or not understood (500).  Package
   responses are carried in 200 response or REPORT message bodies.  This
   package's response codes are defined in Section 4.2.1.

   The schema uses "connection-id" and "conf-id" attributes which are
   imported from schema defined in core Control Framework [SIPCF].

3.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


   This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]
   MUST be supported for media dialogs and conferences.

3.4.  CONTROL Message Body

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the schema defined in
   Section 5 and described in Section 4.  XML messages appearing in
   CONTROL messages MUST contain a <dialogprepare>, <dialogstart> or
   <dialogterminate> request element (Section 4.1).

3.5.  REPORT Message Body

   A valid REPORT body MUST conform to the schema defined in Section 5
   and described in Section 4.  XML messages appearing in REPORT
   messages MUST contain a <response> (Section 4.2), or a (notification)
   <event> element (Section 4.3).

4.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML messages for this control package.

   [Editors Note: since XML Schema may not be able to express all
   constraints expressed in these definitions, in cases where there is a
   difference in constraints, the definitions in the section take
   priority.]

4.1.  Requests

   The following request elements are defined:

   <dialogprepare>:  prepare an IVR dialog for later execution

   <dialogstart>:  start an IVR dialog on a connection or conference

   <dialogterminate>:  terminate an active IVR dialog

4.1.1.  <dialogprepare>

   The <dialogprepare> request is sent from the AS to the MS to request
   preparation of an IVR dialog.  A prepared dialog is executed when the
   AS sends a <dialogstart> request referencing the prepared dialog (see
   Section 4.1.2).

   A <dialogprepare> element has the following attributes:

   src:  string identifying the URI of the dialog document to prepare.
      The attribute is mandatory.  The MS MUST support VoiceXML 2.0
      dialogs and MAY support later versions of VoiceXML or other dialog
      types.

   type:  string identifying the MIME type of the document.  The default
      value is "application/voicexml+xml".  The attribute is optional.

   dialogid:  string indicating a unique name for the dialog.  If this
      attribute is not specified, the MS creates a unique name for the
      dialog.  The value is used in subsequent references to the dialog
      (e.g. as dialogid in a <response>).  It is an error if a dialog
      with the same name already exists on the MS.  The attribute is
      optional.

   The <dialogprepare> element has the following child elements:

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


   <data>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.4) to pass parameters
      into the dialog.  It is an error if a specified parameter is not
      supported by the implementation.  The element is optional.

   <subscribe>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.5) indicating
      notification events to which the AS subscribes.  It is an error if
      a specified notification event is not supported by the
      implementation.  The element is optional.

   <src>:  contains the dialog script itself; e.g. a VoiceXML document.
      The MS MUST support VoiceXML 2.0 dialogs and MAY support later
      versions of VoiceXML or other dialog types.  The element is
      optional.

   <httpparams>:  contains attributes to configure HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616]
      fetching and caching.

      maxage:  string defining a time interval according to the max-age
         parameter in HTTP.  The attribute is optional.

      maxstale:  string defining a time interval according to the max-
         stale parameter in HTTP.  The attribute is optional.

      enctype:  string identifying the encoding type of the submitted
         document.  The default value is "application/
         x-www-form-url-encoded".  The attribute is optional.

      method:  string indicating the HTTP method to use.  Permitted
         values are "post" or "get".  The default value is "get".  The
         attribute is optional.

      The element is optional.

   Exactly one of the src attribute or the <src> element MUST be
   specified; otherwise, it is an error.

   For example, a request to prepare a dialog where the dialog script is
   indicated using the src attribute:

   <dialogprepare src="http://www.example.com/playprompt.vxml">
     <data>
        <item name="audio" value="/media/prompt1.wav"/>
     </data>
   </dialogprepare>

   Where the data parameter "audio" would be available in the VoiceXML
   script as "connection.ccxml.values.audio" so different prompts can be
   played using the same dialog script.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


   In the following example, the VoiceXML dialog script is specified
   inline:

   <dialogprepare>
    <src>
      <vxml version="2.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml">
         <form id='main'>
            <block>
               <audio expr="http://www.example.com/media/prompt1.wav"/>
               <exit/>
             </block>
         </form>
      </vxml>
     </src>
   </dialogprepare>

   When an MS has successfully received a <dialogprepare> request, it
   MUST reply with a <response> element (Section 4.2).

4.1.2.  <dialogstart>

   The <dialogstart> element is sent by the AS to request execution of a
   dialog.  The dialog may be defined in the dialogstart request itself,
   or reference a previously prepared dialog.

   The <dialogstart> element has the following attributes:

   src:  string identifying the URI of the dialog document to start.
      The attribute is optional.  The MS MUST support VoiceXML 2.0
      dialogs and MAY support later versions of VoiceXML or other dialog
      types.

   type:  string identifying the MIME type of the document.  The default
      value is "application/voicexml+xml".  The attribute is optional.

   dialogid:  string indicating a unique name for the dialog.  If this
      attribute is not specified, the MS creates a unique name for the
      dialog.  The value is used in subsequent references to the dialog
      (e.g. as dialogid in a <response>).  It is an error if a dialog
      with the same name already exists on the MS.  The attribute is
      optional.

   prepareddialogid:  string identifying a dialog previously prepared
      using a dialogprepare request.  The attribute is optional.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


   connection-id:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection on which
      this dialog is to be started (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The
      attribute is optional.

   conf-id:  string identifying the conference on which this dialog is
      to be started (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The attribute is
      optional.

   The <dialogstart> element has the following child elements defined:

   <stream>:  contains the following attributes:

      media:  a string indicating the type of media associated with the
         stream.  It is strongly recommended that the following values
         are used for common types of media: "audio" for audio media,
         and "video" for video media.  The attribute is mandatory.

      label:  a string indicating the SDP label associated with a media
         stream ([RFC4574]).  The attribute is optional.

      direction:  a string indicating the direction of the media flow
         between a dialog and its end point conference or connection.
         Defined values are: "sendrecv" (media can be sent and
         received), "sendonly" (media can only be sent), and "recvonly"
         (media can only be received).  The default value is "sendrecv".
         The attribute is optional.

      One or more <stream> elements may be specified so that individual
      media streams can be controlled independently; for example, audio
      only for transmission, but video only for reception.  The <stream>
      element is optional.  If no <stream> elements are specified, then
      the default is the media configuration of the connection or
      conference.  It is an error if a <stream> element is in conflict
      with (a) another <stream> element, (b) with dialog, connection or
      conference media capabilities, or (c) with a SDP label value as
      part of the connection-id (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).

   <data>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.4) to pass parameters
      into the dialog.  It is an error if a specified parameter is not
      supported by the implementation.  The element is optional.

   <subscribe>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.5) indicating
      notification events to which the AS subscribes.  It is an error if
      a specified notification event is not supported by the
      implementation.The element is optional.

   <src>:  contains the dialog script itself; e.g. a VoiceXML document.
      The MS MUST support VoiceXML 2.0 dialogs and MAY support later
      versions of VoiceXML or other dialog types.  The element is
      optional.

   <httpparams>:  contains attributes to configure HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616]
      fetching and caching.

      maxage:  string defining a time interval according to the max-age
         parameter in HTTP.  The attribute is optional.

      maxstale:  string defining a time interval according to the max-
         stale parameter in HTTP.  The attribute is optional.

      enctype:  string identifying the encoding type of the submitted
         document.  The default value is "application/
         x-www-form-url-encoded".  The attribute is optional.

      method:  string indicating the HTTP method to use.  Permitted
         values are "post" or "get".  The default value is "get".  The
         attribute is optional.

      The element is optional.

   [Editors Note: the <stream> element assumes that the use of the SDP
   label by itself is insufficent for media stream control.  In
   particular, the SDP label does not address directionality, nor does
   it address conferences.  Further investigation of the <stream> is is
   required.]

   If the prepareddialogid is specified, it is an error to specify the
   src attribute, <src> element or the type attribute.

   If the prepareddialogid is not specified, exactly one of the src
   attribute or the <src> element MUST be specified; otherwise, it is an
   error.

   Exactly one of the connection-id or conf-id attributes MUST be
   specified.  It is an error to specify both connection-id and conf-id.

   If the prepareddialogid is specified and the <dialogprepare>
   contained a <data> element, it is an error to specify it in
   <dialogstart>.  Likewise, If the prepareddialogid is specified and
   the <dialogprepare> contained a <subscribe> element, it is an error
   to specify it in <dialogstart>.

   For example, a request to start a dialog on a conference where the
   dialog script is indicated using the src attribute:

    <dialogstart conf-id="conference11"
       src="http://www.example.com/playprompt.vxml">
       <data>
         <item name="media" value="/media/prompt1.wav"/>
       </data>
    </dialogstart>

   Where the data parameter "media" would be available in the VoiceXML
   script as "connection.ccxml.values.media" so different prompts can be
   played using the same dialog script.

   In the following example, the VoiceXML dialog script is specified
   inline.

    <dialogstart conf-id="conference11">
       <src>
        <vxml version="2.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml">
         <form id='main'>
            <block>
               <audio expr="http://www.example.com/media/prompt1.wav"/>
               <exit/>
             </block>
          </form>
        </vxml>
       </src>
     </dialogstart>

   In this example, a previously prepared dialog with the dialogid
   "vxi1" is started.

   <dialogstart prepareddialogid="vxi1" conf-id="conference11"/>

   When an MS has successfully received a <dialogstart> request, it MUST
   reply with a <response> element (Section 4.2).

4.1.3.  <dialogterminate>

   A dialog that has been successfully prepared or started can be
   terminated by a <dialogterminate> request element from the AS.

   The <dialogterminate> element has the following attributes:

   dialogid:  string identifying an existing dialog.  The attribute is
      mandatory.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


   immediate:  string with the values "true" or "false" indicating
      whether the dialog is to be terminated immediately or not.  If a
      dialog is terminated immediately, no further dialog event
      notifications are sent (including a dialogexit <event>).  The
      default is "false".  The attribute is optional.

   For example, assuming a dialog with the dialogid "vxi1" has been
   started, it can be terminated immediately with the following request:

   <dialogterminate dialogid="vxi1" immediate="true"/>

   When an MS has successfully received a <dialogterminate> request, it
   MUST reply with a <response> element (Section 4.2).

4.2.  Responses

   Responses are specified in a <response> element.

4.2.1.  <response>

   Reponses to requests are indicated by a <response> element.

   The <response> element has following attributes:

   status:  numeric code indicating the response status.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

   reason:  string specifying a reason for the response status.  The
      attribute is optional.

   dialogid:  string identifying the dialog.  The attribute is optional.

   connection-id:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection
      associated with the dialog (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The
      attribute is optional.

   conf-id:  string identifying the conference associated with the
      dialog (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The attribute is optional.

   The following status codes are defined:

                     Table 1: <response> status codes

   [Editors Note: more status codes may need to be defined.]

   For example, a response when a dialog was prepared successfully:

   <response status="200" dialogid="vxi1"/>

   The response if dialog preparation failed due to an invalid VoiceXML
   script:

    <response status="409" dialogid="vxi1"
       reason="HTTP 404: http://www.example.com/myscript.vxml"/>

   For example, a response when the dialog was started successfully.

    <response status="200" dialogid="vxi1"
                 connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS"/>

4.3.  Notifications

   Event notifications are specified in an <event> element.

4.3.1.  <event>

   Dialog event notifications are either manual or automatic.

   Manual event notifications are defined when an AS subscribes to
   notifications for dialog events using the <subscribe> element of
   <dialogprepare> or <dialogstart>.

   Automatic event notifications are defined as part of a Control
   Package.  The AS SHOULD NOT subscribe to these event notifications.
   The MS MUST support these event notifications.  This package defines
   one automatic notification event: "dialogexit" which indicates that
   an active dialog has terminated.  Note that this notification is not
   sent if the dialog has been terminated by the AS using a
   <dialogterminate/> request where "immediate=true".

   When a dialog generates a notification event, the MS sends the event
   to the AS using an <event> element.

   The <event> element has the following attributes:

   name:  string indicating the name of dialog event.  The string is
      restricted to a sequence of alphanumeric or "." characters.  The
      attribute is mandatory.

   dialogid:  string identifying the dialog.  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   The <event> element has the following child element:

   <data>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.4) to pass information
      additional information about the dialog event.  The element is
      optional.

   For example, when a dialog exits the MS may send a dialogexit <event>
   with data collected during the VoiceXML dialog execution:

   <event name="dialogexit" dialogid="vxi1">
    <data>
      <item name="userinput" value="12345"/>
    </data>

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


   </event>

4.4.  <data>

   The <data> element is a general container for parameterized data.

   The <data> element has no attributes, but has the following child
   elements defined:

   <item>:  contains the following attributes:

      name:  a string indicating the name of the parameter.  The
         attribute is mandatory.

      value:  a string indicating the value of the parameter.  Multiple
         values of a parameters can be specified using space separation.
         The attribute is mandatory.

   Multiple <item> elements may be specified.

   For example, a <data> specifying parameters with simple values:

  <data>
     <item name="initialuri" value="http://www.example.com/start.vxml"/>
     <item name="timeout" value="10s"/>
  </data>

   [Editors Note: we may also want to investigate the use of <item>s
   nested within a top-level <item> to specify complex values. ]

4.5.  <subscribe>

   The <subscribe> element is a container for specifying dialog
   notification events to which an AS subscribes.  Notifications of
   dialog events are delivered using the <event> element (see
   Section 4.3.1).

   The <subscribe> element has no attributes, but has the following
   child elements defined:

   <notify>:  contains the following attributes:

      name:  a string indicating the name of the event to be notified
         of.  The attribute is mandatory.

      The <notify> element may have a <data> child element.

   Multiple <notify> elements may be specified.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package            March 2007


   For example, the AS wishes to subscribe to DTMF and bargein
   notification events associated with a dialog:

   <dialogstart src="promptandcollect"
        connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <subscribe>
       <notify name="dtmf"/>
       <notify name="bargein"/>
     </subscribe>
   </dialogstart>

   If the MS supports these notification events, then it would use the
   <event> element to send notifications during the dialog to the AS
   when the events occured.

   [Editors Note: It may be possible to define a general event
   subscription mechanism as part of the SIP Control Framework.]

   [Editors Note: This Control Package does not specify dialog
   notification events apart from "dialogexit".  Later versions may
   define events such as: "dtmf" (a DTMF key is pressed), "mediastart"
   (media playback started), "bargein" (user has barged in on a prompt),
   and "rtpcontrol" (control data, e.g.  VFU, PoC, etc, is received over
   the RTP control channel.]

5.  Formal Syntax

   [Editors note: A later version of the XML schema may be reference the
   basic IVR schema and specify the package extensions in terms of
   schema extensions. ]

   [Editors note: A later version of the XML schema will provide more
   constraints as expressed in the textual definitions; for example,
   single occurrence of <data> elements, co-occurence on attributes,
   etc.]
