1.  Terminology and Definitions

   The following acronyms are used in this document:

   PNC Provisioning Network Controller

   MDSC Multi Domain Service Coordinator

2.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model to describe the topologies of
   microwave/millimeter(hereafter microwave is used to simplify the
   text).  The microwave topology model augments the TE topology model
   defines in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo].

   The microwave topology model is expected to be used between a
   Provisioning Network Controller(PNC) and a Multi Domain Service

   Coordinator(MDSC)([I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework]).  Possible use
   cases of microwave topology models include:

   1.  The microwave link frequency could be used to understand the
       current frequency usage, enabling a whole view of the network
       topology information, and as an input for network frequency
       planning.

   2.  The microwave radio link could change its bandwidth according to
       the environments under the adaptive modulation mode, e.g., the
       bandwidth will degrade when there's a heavy rain.  To get to know
       of current microwave link bandwidth is important for path
       computation and service provisioning across different
       technologies/networks.

   3.  Due to bandwidth changing feature, availability is normally used
       to describe the microwave radio link characteristic.  [RFC8330]
       defines a mechanism to report bandwidth-availability information
       through OSPF-TE.  It's also necessary to include the information
       in the YANG data model to optimize the path/route computation.

3.2.  Relationship with microwave interface YANG model

   The microwave topology model is expected to be used between a PNC and
   a MDSC.  [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mw-yang] defines an interface YANG model for
   microwave radio link which is used between the PNC and the physical
   device for device configuration.  The PNC is able to convert the

Internet-Draft          Microwave Topology Model               June 2018


   information received from the topology model into the interface
   model.  For example, the link frequency in the topology model is
   mapped to the tx-frequency of the carrier termination in the
   interface model.

   If the purpose is to access more information of the microwave
   interface YANG model through the microwave topology model, a schema
   mount mechanism could be used, see the "interface-root" in the
   microwave topology model.  [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount] defines a
   mechanism to add the schema trees defined by a set of YANG modules
   onto a mount point defined in the schema tree in some YANG module.
   The current defined schema mount mechanism allows mounting of
   complete data models only.  If complete mounting of the microwave
   interface YANG model is not neceesary, a deviation model could be
   created to remove unneeded schema in the microwave interface model,
   and be mounted to the topology model.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040][RFC8040].  The lowest
   NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The
   lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

Internet-Draft          Microwave Topology Model               June 2018


   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TBD.(list subtrees and data nodes and state why they are sensitive)

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TBD.(list subtrees and data nodes and state why they are sensitive)

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a new URI from the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].

             URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
             Registrant Contact: The IESG
             XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA has recorded a YANG module name in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020] as follows:

          Name: ietf-microwave-topology
          Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
          Prefix: mwtopo

Appendix A.  Appendix A Examples of microwave topology

A.1.  Appendix A.1 A topology with single microwave radio link

   Microwave is a transport technology which can be used to transport
   client services, such as ETH.  When an ETH service is transported by
   a single microwave radio link, the topology could be shown as the
   Figure 3.  Note that the figure just shows an example, there might be
   other possiblities to demonstrate the topology.

   When a ETH service is transported over two microwave radio links, the
   topologies could be shown as in Figure 4.  Note that the figure just
   shows one example, there might be other possiblities to demonstrate
   the topology.
