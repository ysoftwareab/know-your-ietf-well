Abstract 
    
   As the deployment of second and third generation cellular networks 
   progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to 
   the Internet. Standardization organizations are making IPv6 
   mandatory in their specifications. However, the concept of IPv6 
   covers many aspects and numerous specifications. In addition, the 
   characteristics of cellular links in terms of bandwidth, cost and 
   delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is used. This document 
   considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to the General Packet 
   Radio Service (GPRS), or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System 
   (UMTS) networks. The document lists basic components of IPv6 
   functionality and discusses some issues relating to the use of these 
   components when operating in these networks.

Internet Draft   IPv6 for Some 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts   May 17, 2002 
 
 
1 Introduction 
         
   Technologies such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), UMTS 
   (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) and CDMA2000 (Code 
   Division Multiple Access 2000) are making it possible for cellular 
   hosts to have an always-on connection to the Internet. IPv6 becomes 
   necessary, as it is expected that the number of such cellular hosts 
   will increase rapidly. Standardization organizations working with 
   cellular technologies have recognized this and are making IPv6 
   mandatory in their specifications.  
   Support for IPv6 and the introduction of UMTS starts with 3GPP 
   Release 99 networks and hosts. IPv6 is specified as the only IP 
   version supported in Release 5 for IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). 
 
1.1 Scope of this Document 
    
   For the purposes of this document, a cellular interface is 
   considered to be the interface to a cellular access network based on 
   the following standards: 3GPP GPRS and UMTS Release 99, Release 4, 
   Release 5, as well as future UMTS releases. A cellular host is 
   considered to be a host with such a cellular interface.  
    
   This document lists IPv6 specifications and discusses some issues 
   relating to the use of these specifications when operating over 
   cellular interfaces. Such a specification is necessary in order for 
   the optimal use of IPv6 in a cellular environment. The description 
   is made from a cellular host point of view. Important considerations 
   are given in order to eliminate unnecessary user confusion over 
   configuration options, ensure interoperability and to provide an 
   easy reference for those implementing IPv6 in a cellular host. It is 
   necessary to ensure that cellular hosts are good citizens of the 
   Internet.  
    
   The main audience of this document are the implementers of cellular 
   hosts that will be used with GPRS, 3GPP UMTS Release 99, Release 4, 
   Release 5, or future releases of UMTS. The document provides 
   guidance on which parts of IPv6 to implement in such cellular hosts. 
   Parts of this document may also apply to other cellular link types, 
   but no such detailed analysis has been done yet and is a topic of 
   future work. This document should not be used as a definitive list 
   of IPv6 functionality for cellular links other than those listed 
   above. Future changes in 3GPP networks that require changes in host 
   implementations may result in updates to this document. 
    
   There are different ways to implement cellular hosts: 
 
      - The host can be a "closed 2G or 3G host" with a very compact 
        size and optimized applications, with no possibility to add 
        or download applications that can have IP communications. An 
        example of such a host is a very simple form of a mobile 
        phone.

Internet Draft   IPv6 for Some 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts   May 17, 2002 
 
 
      -  The host can be an "open 2G or 3G host" with a compact size, 
         but where it is possible to download applications; such as a 
         PDA-type of phone.  
    
   If a cellular host has additional interfaces on which IP is used, 
   (such as Ethernet, WLAN, Bluetooth, etc.) then there may be 
   additional requirements for the device, beyond what is discussed in 
   this document.  Additionally, this document does not make any 
   recommendations on the functionality required on laptop computers 
   having a cellular interface such as a PC card, other than 
   recommending link specific behavior on the cellular link. 
    
   This document discusses IPv6 functionality as specified when this 
   draft is written. Ongoing work on IPv6 may affect what is needed 
   from future hosts. The reader should also be advised other relevant 
   work exists for various other layers. Examples of this include the 
   header compression work done in the IETF ROHC group, or the TCP work 
   in [TCPWIRELESS].

1.4 Cellular Host IPv6 Features  
         
   This specification defines IPv6 features for cellular hosts in three 
   groups. 
    
     Basic IP 
    
          In this group, basic parts of IPv6 are described.  
    
     IP Security 
      
          In this group, the IP Security parts, as well as, the 
          suitability of various security functions to different 
          applications in cellular hosts are discussed. 
    
     Mobility 
    
          In this group, IP layer mobility issues are discussed.  
           
2 Basic IP 
      
2.1 RFC1981 - Path MTU Discovery for IP Version 6 
      
   Path MTU Discovery [RFC-1981] may be used. Cellular hosts with a 
   link MTU larger than the minimum IPv6 link MTU (1280 octets) can use 
   Path MTU Discovery in order to discover the real path MTU. The 
   relative overhead of IPv6 headers is minimized through the use of 
   longer packets, thus making better use of the available bandwidth. 
    
   The IPv6 specification [RFC-2460] states in chapter 5 that "a 
   minimal IPv6 implementation (e.g., in a boot ROM) may simply 
   restrict itself to sending packets no larger than 1280 octets, and 
   omit implementation of Path MTU Discovery." 
    
   If Path MTU Discovery is not implemented then the sending packet 
   size is limited to 1280 octets (standard limit in [RFC-2460]). 
   However, if this is done, the cellular host must be able to receive 
   packets with size up to the link MTU before reassembly. This is 
   because the node at the other side of the link has no way of knowing 
   less than the MTU is accepted. 
         
2.2 RFC2373 - IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture 
         
   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC-2373] is a mandatory part of 
   IPv6. Currently, this specification is being updated by 
   [ADDRARCHv3]; therefore, this specification may be made obsolete by 
   the new one, in which case the new specification must be supported.

Internet Draft   IPv6 for Some 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts   May 17, 2002 
 
 
2.3 RFC2460 - Internet Protocol Version 6 
         
   The Internet Protocol Version 6 is specified in [RFC-2460]. This 
   specification is a mandatory part of IPv6.  
    
   By definition, a cellular host acts as a host, not as a router.  
   Implementation requirements for a cellular router are not defined in 
   this document. 
    
   Consequently, the cellular host must implement all non-router packet 
   receive processing as described in RFC 2460.  This includes the 
   generation of ICMPv6 error reports, and the processing of at least 
   the following extension headers: 
    
     - Hop-by-Hop Options header: at least the Pad1 and PadN options 
     - Destination Options header: at least the Pad1 and PadN options 
     - Routing (Type 0) header: final destination (host) processing 
       only 
     - Fragment header 
     - AH and ESP headers (see also a discussion on the use of IPsec 
       for various purposes in Section 3) 
     - The No Next Header value 
    
   Unrecognized options in Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination Options 
   extensions must be processed as described in RFC 2460. 
        
   The cellular host must follow the packet transmission rules in RFC 
   2460.  
    
   The cellular host must always be able to receive and reassemble 
   fragment headers. It will also need to be able to send a fragment 
   header in cases where it communicates with an IPv4 host through a 
   translator. 
     
   Cellular hosts should only process routing headers when they are the 
   final destination and return errors if the processing of the routing 
   header requires them to forward the packet to another node. This 
   will also ensure that the cellular hosts will not be inappropriately 
   used as relays or components in Denial-of-Service attacks. Acting as 
   the destination involves the following: the cellular hosts must 
   check the Segments Left field in the header, and proceed if it is 
   zero or one and the next address is one of the host's addresses. If 
   not, however, the host must implement error checks as specified in 
   section 4.4 of RFC 2460. There is no need for the host to send 
   Routing Headers. 
    
2.4 RFC2461 - Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 
         
   Neighbor Discovery is described in [RFC-2461]. This specification is 
   a mandatory part of IPv6.

Internet Draft   IPv6 for Some 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts   May 17, 2002 
 
 
2.4.1 Neighbor Discovery in 3GPP Networks 
      
   In GPRS and UMTS networks, some Neighbor Discovery messages can 
   cause unnecessary traffic and consume valuable (limited) bandwidth. 
   GPRS and UMTS links resemble a point-to-point link; hence, the 
   host's only neighbor on the cellular link is the default router that 
   is already known through Router Discovery. This router is   
   typically not the final destination for the host's traffic. 
   Additionally, due to special characteristics of the cellular link, 
   lower layer connectivity information should make it unnecessary to 
   track the reachability of the router. Therefore, while the host must 
   support Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement messages, their use 
   is not necessary and the host may choose to not initiate them. 
    
   In addition, a cellular host should not send the link layer option 
   on its cellular interface, and should silently ignore it when 
   received on the same interface. 
    
   Hosts in a UMTS network, only need to use Router Solicitations and 
   Router Advertisements for 3GPP IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration (see 
   appendix B). Neighbor Solicitations and Advertisements may be used 
   for Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD). They are not required 
   for 3GPP IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, since address 
   duplication is not possible in this address assignment mechanism 
   (see section 2.5.1).  
         
2.5 RFC2462 - IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration 
    
   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is defined in [RFC-2462]. 
   This specification is a mandatory part of IPv6.  
    
2.5.1 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in 3GPP Networks 
 
   A cellular host in a 3GPP network must process a Router 
   Advertisement as stated in section 2.4. 
    
   Hosts in 3GPP networks can set DupAddrDetectTransmits equal to zero, 
   as each delegated prefix is unique within its scope when allocated 
   using the 3GPP IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. Thus, 
   Duplicate Address Detection is not required on the cellular 
   interface. DAD messages will not be sent or received by the IPv6 
   cellular host on the cellular interface. 
    
   See appendix B for more details on 3GPP IPv6 Stateless Address 
   Autoconfiguration. 
 
2.6 RFC2463 - Internet Control Message Protocol for the IPv6 
         
   The Internet Control Message Protocol for the IPv6 is defined [RFC-
   2463]. This specification is a mandatory part of IPv6.  Currently, 
   this work is being updated.

Internet Draft   IPv6 for Some 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts   May 17, 2002 
 
 
    
   As per RFC 2463 section 2, ICMPv6 requirements must be fully 
   implemented by every IPv6 node. See also Section 3 for an 
   explanation of the use of IPsec for protecting ICMPv6 
   communications. 
    
2.7 RFC2472 - IP version 6 over PPP 
      
   IPv6 over PPP [RFC-2472] must be supported for cellular hosts that 
   implement PPP. 
    
2.7.1 IP version 6 over PPP in 3GPP Networks 
    
   A cellular host in a 3GPP network must support the IPv6CP interface 
   identifier option. This option is needed to be able to connect other 
   devices to the Internet using a PPP link between the cellular device 
   (MT) and other devices (TE, e.g. a laptop). The MT performs the PDP 
   Context activation based on a request from the TE. This results in 
   an interface identifier being suggested by the MT to the TE, using 
   the IPv6CP option. To avoid any duplication in link-local addresses 
   between the TE and the GGSN, the MT must always reject other 
   suggested interface identifiers by the TE. This results in the TE 
   always using the interface identifier suggested by the GGSN for its 
   link-local address.  
    
   The rejection of interface identifiers suggested by the TE is only 
   done for creation of link local addresses, according to 3GPP 
   specifications. The use of privacy addresses [RFC-3041] for site-
   local and global addresses is not affected by the above procedure. 
   The above procedure is only concerned with assigning the interface 
   identifier used for forming link-local addresses, and does not 
   preclude TE from using other interface identifiers for addresses 
   with larger scopes (i.e. site-local and global). 
  
2.8 RFC2473 - Generic Packet Tunneling in IPv6 Specification 
 
   Generic Packet Tunneling [RFC-2473] may be supported if needed for 
   transition mechanisms. 
    
2.9 RFC2710 - Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6 
    
   Multicast Listener Discovery [RFC-2710] may be supported, if the 
   cellular host is supporting applications that require the use of 
   multicast services. There is no need for MLD if the host only 
   supports the well-known (hard coded in IPv6 implementations) link 
   local multicast addresses. MLD is not used for listening on such 
   addresses.

Internet Draft   IPv6 for Some 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts   May 17, 2002 
 
 
2.10 RFC2711 - IPv6 Router Alert Option 
    
   The Router Alert Option [RFC-2711] may be supported. Currently, this 
   option is needed for MLD implementations (see section 2.9) or when 
   RSVP [RFC-2205] is used. 
         
2.11 RFC2893 - Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers 
    
   [RFC-2893] specifies a number of transition mechanisms for IPv6 
   hosts. Cellular hosts may support the dual stack mechanism mentioned 
   in this specification. This also includes resolving addresses from 
   the DNS and selecting the type of address for the correspondent host 
   (IPv4 vs. IPv6). Cellular hosts should not support configured or 
   automatic tunnels to avoid unnecessary tunneling over the air 
   interface, unless there are no other mechanisms available. Tunneling 
   can lead to poor usage of available bandwidth. 
    
2.12 RFC3041 - Privacy Extensions for Address Configuration in IPv6 
    
   Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC-
   3041] may be used. Refer to section 5 for a discussion of the 
   benefits of privacy extensions in a 3GPP network. 
         
2.13 RFC3056 - Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds 
    
   Connection of IPv6 domains via IPv4 clouds [RFC-3056] should not be 
   supported to avoid unnecessary tunneling over the air interface. For 
   a cellular host, this specification would mean capability to create 
   6to4 tunnels starting from the cellular host itself. In a cellular 
   environment, tunneling over the air interface should be minimized as 
   tunneling can lead to poor usage of available bandwidth. Hence, 
   intermediate 6to4 routers should carry out 6to4 tunneling, instead 
   of cellular hosts.  
         
2.14 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) 
    
   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [DHCPv6] may be 
   used. DHCPv6 is not required for address autoconfiguration when IPv6 
   stateless autoconfiguration is used. However, DHCPv6 may be useful 
   for other configuration needs on a cellular host. 
    
2.15 Default Address Selection for IPv6 
    
   Default Address Selection for IPv6 [DEFADDR] is needed for cellular 
   hosts with more than one address.  
 
2.16 DNS 
    
   Cellular hosts should support DNS, as described in [RFC-1034], [RFC-
   1035] and [RFC-1886].

   If DNS is used, a cellular host should perform DNS requests in the 
   recursive mode, to limit signaling over the air interface. 
    
3 IP Security 
    
   IPsec [RFC-2401] is a fundamental part of IPv6, and support for AH 
   and ESP is described as mandatory in the specifications. 
    
   The first part of this section discusses the applicability of IP 
   Security and other security mechanisms for common tasks in cellular 
   hosts. The second part, subsections 3.1 to 3.13, lists the RFCs 
   related to IPsec and discusses the use of these parts of IPsec in a 
   cellular context. 
    
   In general, the need to use a security mechanism depends on the 
   intended application for it. Different security mechanisms are 
   useful in different contexts, and have different limitations. Some 
   applications require the use of TLS [RFC-2246], in some situations 
   IPsec is used. 
    
   It is not realistic to list all possible services here, and it is 
   expected that application protocol specifications have requirements 
   on what security services they require. Note that cellular hosts 
   able to download applications must be prepared to offer sufficient 
   security services for these applications regardless of the needs of 
   the initial set of applications in those hosts. 
    
   The following sections list specifications related to the IPsec 
   functionality, and discuss their applicability in a cellular 
   context. In some applications, a different set of protocols may 
   need a different set of protocols may need to be employed. 
   In particular, the below discussion is not relevant for applications 
   that use other security services than IPsec. 
         
3.1 RFC2104 - HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication 
    
   This specification [RFC-2104] must be supported. It is referenced by 
   RFC 2403 that describes how IPsec protects the integrity of packets. 
    
3.2 RFC2401 - Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol 
         
   This specification [RFC-2401] must be supported. 
         
3.3 RFC2402 - IP Authentication Header 
         
   This specification [RFC-2402] must be supported. The IPsec WG has 
   discussed the role of AH in the future, and it is possible that it 
   will be made optional in the future versions of the IPsec protocol 
   set. Implementers are recommended to take this in account.

3.4 RFC2403 - The Use of HMAC-MD5-96 within ESP and AH 
         
   This specification [RFC-2403] must be supported. 
 
3.5 RFC2404 - The Use of HMAC-SHA-96 within ESP and AH 
         
   This specification [RFC-2404] must be supported. 
         
3.6 RFC2405 - The ESP DES-CBC Cipher Algorithm With Explicit IV   
         
   This specification [RFC-2405] may be supported. It is, however, 
   recommended that stronger algorithms than DES be used.  Algorithms, 
   such as AES, are undergoing work in the IPsec working group. 
         
3.7 RFC2406 - IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) 
    
   This specification [RFC-2406] must be supported. 
         
3.8 RFC2407 - The Internet IP Security DoI for ISAKMP 
    
   Automatic key management, [RFC-2408] and [RFC-2409], is not a 
   mandatory part of the IP Security Architecture. Note, however, that 
   in the cellular environment the IP addresses of a host may change 
   dynamically. For this reason the use of manually configured Security 
   Associations is not practical, as the newest host address would have 
   to be updated to the SA database of the peer as well.  
    
   Even so, it is not clear that all applications would use IKE for key 
   management. For instance, hosts may use IPsec ESP [RFC-2406] for 
   protecting SIP signaling in the IMS [3GPP-ACC] but provide 
   authentication and key management through another mechanism such as 
   UMTS AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) [UMTS-AKA]. 
    
   It is likely that several simplifying assumptions can be made in the 
   cellular environment, with respect to the mandated parts of the IP 
   Security DoI, ISAKMP, and IKE. Although work on such simplifications 
   would be useful, is not described here. 
    
3.9 RFC2408 - The Internet Security Association and Key Management  
              Protocol  
 
   This specification [RFC-2408] is optional according to the IPv6 
   specifications, but may be necessary in some applications, as 
   described in Section 3.8. 
    
3.10 RFC2409 - The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)  
    
   This specification [RFC-2409] is optional according to the IPv6 
   specifications, but may be necessary in some applications, as 
   described in Section 3.8.

   Interactions with the ICMPv6 packets and IPsec policies may cause 
   unexpected behavior for IKE-based SA negotiation unless some special 
   handling is performed in the implementations. 
    
   The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions, which in IPv4 were 
   either non-existent or provided by lower layers. For instance, IPv6 
   implements address resolution using an IP packet, ICMPv6 Neighbor 
   Solicitation message. In contrast, IPv4 uses an ARP message at a 
   lower layer. 
    
   The IPsec architecture has a Security Policy Database that specifies 
   which traffic is protected, and how. It turns out that the 
   specification of policies in the presence of ICMPv6 traffic is not 
   easy. For instance, a simple policy of protecting all traffic 
   between two hosts on the same network would trap even address 
   resolution messages, leading to a situation where IKE can't 
   establish a Security Association since in order to send the IKE UDP 
   packets one would have had to send the Neighbor Solicitation 
   Message, which would have required an SA. 
    
   In order to avoid this problem, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor 
   Advertisement, Router Solicitation, and Router Advertisement 
   messages must not lead to the use of IKE-based SA negotiation. The 
   Redirect message should not lead to the use of IKE-based SA 
   negotiation. Other ICMPv6 messages may use IKE-based SA negotiation 
   as is desired in the Security Policy Data Base. 
    
   Note that the above limits the usefulness of IPsec in protecting all 
   ICMPv6 communications. For instance, it may not be possible to 
   protect the ICMPv6 traffic between a cellular host and its next hop 
   router. (Which may be hard in any case due to the need to establish 
   a suitable public key infrastructure. Since roaming is allowed, this 
   infrastructure would have to authenticate all hosts to all routers.) 
    
3.11 RFC2410 - The NULL Encryption Algorithm & its Use With IPsec 
    
   This specification [RFC-2410] must be supported. 
    
3.12 RFC2451 - The ESP CBC-Mode Cipher Algorithms  
    
   This specification [RFC-2451] must be supported if encryption 
   algorithms other than DES are implemented, e.g.: CAST-128, RC5, 
   IDEA, Blowfish, 3DES. 
 
4. Mobility  
    
   For the purposes of this document, IP mobility is not relevant. When 
   Mobile IPv6 specification is approved, a future update to this 
   document may address these issues, as there may be some effects on 
   IPv6 hosts due to Mobile IP. The movement of cellular hosts within 
   3GPP networks is handled by link layer mechanisms.

5. Security Considerations 
 
   This document does not specify any new protocols or functionality, 
   and as such, it does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities. 
   However, specific profiles of IPv6 functionality are proposed for 
   different situations, and vulnerabilities may open or close 
   depending on which functionality is included and what is not. There 
   are also aspects of the cellular environment that make certain types 
   of vulnerabilities more severe. The following issues are discussed: 
    
   - The suggested limitations (Section 2.3) in the processing of 
     routing headers limits also exposure to Denial-of-Service attacks  
     through cellular hosts. 
    
   - IPv6 addressing privacy [RFC3041] may be used in cellular hosts.  
     However, it should be noted that in the 3GPP model, the network 
     would assign new addresses, in most cases, to hosts in roaming 
     situations and typically, also when the cellular hosts activate a 
     PDP context. This means that 3GPP networks will already provide a 
     limited form of addressing privacy, and no global tracking of a 
     single host is possible through its address. On the other hand, 
     since a GGSN's coverage area is expected to be very large when 
     compared to currently deployed default routers (no handovers 
     between GGSNs are possible), a cellular host can keep an address 
     for a long time. Hence, IPv6 addressing privacy can be used for 
     additional privacy during the time the host is on and in the same 
     area. The privacy features can also be used to e.g. make different 
     transport sessions appear to come from different IP addresses. 
     However, it is not clear that these additional efforts confuse 
     potential observers any further, as they could monitor only the 
     network prefix part. 
    
   - The use of various security services such as IPsec or TLS in the 
     connection of typical applications in cellular hosts is discussed 
     in Chapter 3 and recommendations are given there. 
    
   - Chapter 3 also discusses under what conditions it is possible to 
     provide IPsec protection of e.g. ICMPv6 communications 
    
   - The airtime used by cellular hosts is expensive. In some cases, 
     users are billed according to the amount of data they transfer to 
     and from their host. It is crucial for both the network and the 
     users that the airtime is used correctly and no extra charges are 
     applied to users due to misbehaving third parties. The cellular 
     links also have a limited capacity, which means that they may not 
     necessarily be able to accommodate more traffic than what the user 
     selected, such as a multimedia call. Additional traffic might 
     interfere with the service level experienced by the user. While 
     Quality of Service mechanisms mitigates these problems to an 
     extent, it is still apparent that Denial-of-Service (DoS) aspects 
     may be highlighted in the cellular environment. It is possible for 
 
Manyfolks                                                    [Page 13] 
 
 
Internet Draft   IPv6 for Some 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts   May 17, 2002 
 
 
     existing DoS attacks that use for instance packet amplification to 
     be substantially more damaging in this environment. How these 
     attacks can be protected against is still an area of further 
     study. It is also often easy to fill the cellular link and queues 
     on both sides with additional or large packets. 
    
   - Within some service provider networks, it is possible to buy a 
     prepaid cellular subscription without presenting personal 
     identification. Attackers that wish to remain unidentified could 
     leverage this. Note that while the user hasn't been identified,
     the equipment still is; the operators can follow the identity of 
     the device and block it from further use. The operators must have 
     procedures in place to take notice of third party complaints 
     regarding the use of their customers' devices. It may also be 
     necessary for the operators to have attack detection tools that 
     enable them to efficiently detect attacks launched from the 
     cellular hosts. 
    
   - Cellular devices that have local network interfaces (such as IrDA 
     or Bluetooth) may be used to launch attacks through them, unless 
     the local interfaces are secured in an appropriate manner. 
     Therefore, local network interfaces should have access control to 
     prevent others from using the cellular host as an intermediary.

Appendix B Cellular Host IPv6 Addressing in the 3GPP Model  
    
   The appendix aims to very briefly describe the 3GPP IPv6 addressing 
   model for 2G (GPRS) and 3G (UMTS) cellular networks from Release 99 
   onwards. More information can be found from 3GPP Technical 
   Specification 23.060. 
    
   There are two possibilities to allocate the address for an IPv6 
   node: stateless and stateful autoconfiguration. The stateful address 
   allocation mechanism needs a DHCP server to allocate the address for 
   the IPv6 node.  On the other hand, the stateless autoconfiguration 
   procedure does not need any external entity involved in the address 
   autoconfiguration (apart from the GGSN). 
    
   In order to support the standard IPv6 stateless address 
   autoconfiguration mechanism, as recommended by the IETF, the GGSN 
   shall assign a prefix that is unique within its scope to each 
   primary PDP context that uses IPv6 stateless address 
   autoconfiguration. This avoids the necessity to perform Duplicate 
   Address Detection at the network level for every address built by 
   the mobile host. The GGSN always provides an Interface Identifier to 
   the mobile host. The Mobile host uses the interface identifier 
   provided by the GGSN to generate its link-local address. Since the 
   GGSN provides the cellular host with the interface identifier, it 
   must ensure the uniqueness of such identifier on the link (I.e. no 
   collisions between its own link local address and the cellular 
   host's).  
    
   In addition, the GGSN will not use any of the prefixes assigned to 
   cellular hosts to generate any of its own addresses.  
   This use of the interface identifier, combined with the fact that 
   each PDP context is allocated a unique prefix, will eliminate the

   need for DAD messages over the air interface, and consequently 
   allows an efficient use of bandwidth. Furthermore, the allocation of 
   a prefix to each PDP context will allow hosts to implement the 
   privacy extensions in RFC 3041 without the need for further DAD 
   messages.  
    
Appendix C Transition Issues 
      
   IETF has specified a number of IPv4 / IPv6 transition mechanisms 
   [RFC-2893] to ensure smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 and 
   interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6 during the transition period. 
   The three main transition methods from a cellular network point of 
   view are dual IPv4 / IPv6 stacks, tunneling and protocol 
   translators, such as NAT-PT or SIIT. 
    
   It is recommended that cellular hosts have dual IPv4 / IPv6 stacks 
   to be able to interoperate with both IPv4 and IPv6 domains and use 
   both IPv6 and IPv4 applications / services. Tunneling (for example 
   RFC 3056 - Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds) should be 
   carried out in the network.  In addition, any protocol translation 
   function, such as NAT-PT, should be implemented in the network, not 
   in the cellular host.  
    
   The tunneling mechanism specified by [RFC-2529] is not relevant for 
   a cellular host. [RFC-2529] allows isolated IPv6-only hosts to 
   connect to an IPv6 router via an IPv4 domain. The scenario of an 
   IPv6-only host in an IPv4-only cellular network is considered 
   unlikely.
