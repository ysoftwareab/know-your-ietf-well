1. Terminology 
    
   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC3945], [HIER], and  
   [MRN-REQ]. 
    
    
2. Introduction 
 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS to 
   handle multiple switching technologies: packet switching (PSC), 
   layer-two switching (L2SC), TDM switching (TDM), wavelength switching 
   (LSC) and fiber switching (FSC) (see [RFC 3945]). 
    
   A data plane layer is a collection of network resources capable of 
   terminating and/or switching data traffic of a particular format. For 
   example, LSC, TDM VC-11 and TDM VC-4-64c represent three different 
   layers. A network comprising transport nodes with different data 
   plane switching layers controlled by a single GMPLS control plane 
   instance is called a Multi-Layer Network (MLN).  
 
   A GMPLS switching type (PSC, TDM, etc.) describes the ability of a 
   node to forward data of a particular data plane technology, and 
   uniquely identifies a control plane region. The notion of LSP Region 
   is defined in [HIER]. A network comprised of multiple switching types 
   (e.g. PSC and TDM) controlled by a single GMPLS control plane 
   instance is called a Multi-Region Network (MRN). 
    
   Note that the region is a control plane only concept. That is, layers 
   of the same region share the same switching technology and, 
   therefore, need the same set of technology specific signaling 
   objects.  
 
   Note that a MRN is necessarily a MLN, but not vice versa, as a MLN 
   may consist of a single region (control of multiple data plane layers 
   within a region). Hence, in the following, we use the term layer if 
   the mechanism discussed applies equally to layers and regions (e.g. 
   VNT, virtual TE-link, etc.), and we specifically use the term region 
   if the mechanism applies only for supporting a MRN. 
 
   The objectives of this document are to evaluate existing GMPLS 
   mechanisms and protocols ([RFC 3945], [GMPLS-RTG], [GMPLS-SIG]) 
   against the requirements for MLN and MRN, defined in [MRN-REQ]. From 
   this evaluation, we identify several areas where additional protocol 
   extensions and modifications are required to meet these requirements, 
   and provide guidelines for potential extensions. 
    
   Section 3 provides an overview of MLN/MRN requirements. 
   Section 4 evaluates for each of these requirements, whether current 
   GMPLS protocols and mechanisms allow addressing the requirements. 
   When the requirements are not met, the document identifies whether

   the required mechanisms could rely on GMPLS protocols and procedure 
   extensions or if it is entirely out of the scope of GMPLS protocols. 
    
   Note that this document specifically addresses GMPLS control plane   
   functionality for MLN/MRN in the context of a single administrative 
   control plane partition. 
  
3. MLN/MRN Requirements Overview 
 
   [MRN-REQ] lists a set of functional requirements for Multi 
   Layer/Region Networks (MLN/MRN). These requirements are summarized 
   below: 
    
        - Support of robust Virtual Network Topology (VNT)   
          reconfiguration. This implies the following requirements: 
                - Optimal control of FA-LSP setup   
                  and release; 
                - Support for virtual TE-links; 
                - Traffic Disruption minimization during FA-LSP release  
                  (e.g. network reconfiguration events); 
                - Stability 
    
        - Support for FA-LSP attributes inheritance; 
         
        - Support for Triggered Signaling; 
 
        - Support for FA data plane connectivity verification; 
 
        - Support for Multi-region signaling; 
 
        - Advertisement of the adaptation capabilities and resources. 
 
4. Analysis 
    
4.1. Multi-Layer Aspects 
    
4.1.1. Support for Virtual Network Topology Reconfiguration 
 
   A set of lower-layer FA-LSPs provides a Virtual Network Topology 
   (VNT) to the upper-layer. By reconfiguring the VNT (FA-LSP 
   setup/release) according to traffic demands between source and 
   destination node pairs of a layer, network performance factors such 
   as maximum link utilization and residual capacity of the network can 
   be optimized. Such optimal VNT reconfiguration implies several 
   mechanisms that are analyzed in the following sections. 
    
   Note that the VNT approach is just one approach among others, to 
   perform inter-layer Traffic Engineering.

4.1.1.1. Control of FA-LSPs Setup/Release 
         
   In a Multi-Layer Network, FA-LSPs are created, modified, released 
   periodically according to the change of incoming traffic demands from 
   the upper layer. 
    
   This implies a TE mechanism that takes into account the demands 
   matrix, the TE topology and potentially the current VNT, in order to 
   compute a new VNT.  
    
   Several building blocks are required to support such TE mechanism: 
        - Discovery of TE topology and available resources; 
        - Collection of traffic demands of the upper layer; 
        - VNT engine, ensuring VNT computation and reconfiguration    
          according to upper layer traffic demands and TE topology  
         (and potentially old VNT); 
        - FA-LSP setup/release; 
    
   GMPLS routing protocols support TE topology discovery and  
   GMPLS signaling protocols allow setting up/releasing FA-LSPs. 
 
   VNT computation and reconfiguration is out of the scope of GMPLS 
   protocols. Such functionality can be achieved directly on layer 
   border LSRs, or one or more external tools, as for instance Path 
   Computation Elements (PCE) (see [PCE-ARCH]).  
 
   The set of traffic demands of the upper layer is required to 
   recompute and re-optimize the VNT. This requires knowledge of the 
   aggregated bandwidth reserved by upper layer LSPs established between 
   any pair of border LSRs.  
   Existing GMPLS routing allows for the collection of traffic demands 
   of the upper region. It can be deduced from FA TE-link 
   advertisements.  
   The set of traffic demands can be inferred: 
        - either directly, based on upper-layer FA TE-link 
           advertisements. The traffic demands between two points 
           correspond to the cumulated bandwidth reserved by upper-layer 
           LSPs between these two points; 
        - or indirectly, based on lower-layer FA TE-link 
           advertisements. In this case a mechanism to infer the upper-
           layer traffic demand from the aggregated bandwidth reserved 
           in lower-layer LSPs might be required, as all pairs of border 
           nodes may not be directly connected by a lower layer LSP. 
    
   Collection of traffic demands of an upper region may actually be 
   achieved in several ways depending on the location of VNT engines: 
        - If a VNT engine is distributed on border region LSRs, then the  
          collection of traffic demands would rely on existing GMPLS  
          routing, as per described above;  
        - If a VNT engine is located on an external tool (e.g. a PCE)  
          then the collection of traffic demands may be achieved using  
          existing GMPLS routing, provided that the tool relies on GMPLS

          routing to discover TE link information, or it may rely on  
          another mechanism out of the scope of GMPLS protocols (e.g.  
          SNMP, PCC-PCE communication protocol…). 
 
4.1.1.2. Virtual TE-Links 
         
   A Virtual TE-link is a TE-link between two nodes, not actually 
   associated to a fully provisioned FA-LSP. A Virtual TE-link 
   represents the potentiality to setup a FA-LSP. There is no IGP 
   adjacency associated to a Virtual TE-link. A Virtual TE-link is 
   advertised as any classical TE-link, i.e. following the rules in 
   [HIER] defined for fully provisioned TE-links. Particularly, the 
   flooding scope of a Virtual TE-link is within an IGP area, as any TE-
   link. 
     
   During its signaling, if an upper-layer LSP makes use of a Virtual 
   TE-link, the underlying FA-LSP is immediately signaled and 
   provisioned. 
    
   The use of Virtual TE-links has two main advantages: 
    
     - flexibility: allows to compute a LSP path using TE-links and this 
       without taking into account the actual status of the  
       corresponding FA-LSP in the lower layer in terms of provisioning; 
     
     - stability: allows stability of TE-links, while 
       avoiding wastage of bandwidth in the lower layer, as data 
       plane connections are not established. 
    
   Note also that it avoids state maintenance but is susceptible to 
   create contention if no adequate/consistent admission control is put 
   in place. 
 
   Virtual TE-links are setup/deleted/modified dynamically, according to 
   the change of the (forecast) traffic demand, operator's policies for 
   capacity utilization, and the available resources in the lower layer. 
    
   The support of Virtual TE-links requires two main building blocks: 
        - A TE mechanism for dynamic modification of Virtual TE-link    
          Topology; 
        - A signaling mechanism for the dynamic setup and deletion of 
          virtual TE-links. Setting up a virtual TE-link  
          requires a signaling mechanism allowing an end-to-end  
          association between Virtual TE-link end points so as to  
          exchange link identifiers as well as some TE parameters. 
    
   The TE mechanism responsible for triggering/policing dynamic 
   modification of Virtual TE-links is out of the scope of GMPLS 
   protocols. 
    
   Current GMPLS signaling does not allow setting up and releasing 
   Virtual TE-links. Hence GMPLS signaling must be extended to support 
 
Le Roux, et al.   Evaluation of GMPLS against MLN/MRN Reqs    [Page 6] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-leroux-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-eval-02.txt   October 2005 


   Virtual TE-links. The association between Virtual TE-link end-points 
   may rely on extensions to the RSVP-TE ASON Call procedure ([GMPLS-
   ASON]). 
    
   Note that the support of Virtual TE-link does not require any GMPLS 
   routing extension. 
 
4.1.1.3. Traffic Disruption Minimization During FA-LSP Release 
 
   Before deleting a given FA-LSP, all nested LSPs have to be rerouted 
   and removed from the FA-LSP to avoid traffic disruption. 
   The mechanisms required here are similar to those required for 
   graceful deletion of a TE-Link. A Graceful TE-link deletion mechanism 
   allows for the deletion of a TE-link without disrupting traffic of 
   TE-LSPs that where using the TE-link. 
   GMPLS protocols do not provide for explicit indication to trigger 
   such operation. 
    
   Hence, GMPLS routing and/or signaling extensions are required 
   to support graceful deletion of TE-links.  This may rely, for 
   instance, on new signaling Error code to notify head-end LSRs that a 
   TE-link along the path of a LSP is going to disappear, and also on 
   new routing attributes (if limited to a single IGP area), such as 
   defined in [GR-SHUT]. 
 
4.1.1.4. Stability 
         
   The upper-layer LSP stability may be impaired if the VNT undergoes 
   frequent changes. In this context robustness of the VNT is defined as 
   the capability to smooth impact of these changes and avoid their 
   subsequent propagation. 
    
   Guaranteeing VNT stability is out of the scope of GMPLS protocols and 
   relies entirely on the capability of TE algorithms to minimize 
   routing perturbations. This requires that the TE algorithm takes into 
   account the old VNT when computing a new VNT, and tries to minimize 
   the perturbation. 
          
4.1.2. Support for FA-LSP Attributes Inheritance 
 
   When FA TE-link parameters are inherited from FA-LSP parameters, 
   specific inheritance rules are applied.  
    
   This relies on local procedures and policies and is out of the scope 
   of GMPLS protocols.  
   Note that this requires that both head-end and tail-end of the FA-LSP 
   are driven by same policies.

4.1.3. Support for Triggered Signaling. 
 
   When a LSP crosses the boundary from an upper to a lower layer, it 
   may be nested in or stitched to a lower-layer LSP. If such an LSP 
   does not exist the LSP may be established dynamically. Such a 
   mechanism is referred to as "Triggered signaling".  
    
   Triggered signaling requires the following building blocks: 
        - The identification of layer boundaries. 
        - A path computation engine capable of computing a path     
          containing multiple layers. 
        - A mechanism for nested signaling. 
 
   The identification of layer boundaries is supported by GMPLS routing 
   protocols. The identification of layer boundaries is performed using 
   the interface switching capability descriptor associated to the TE-
   link (see [HIER] and [GMPLS-RTG]). 
    
   The capability to compute a path containing multiple layers is a 
   local implementation issue and is out of the scope of GMPLS protocols. 
    
   A mechanism for nested signaling is defined in [HIER]. 
    
   Hence, GMPLS protocols already meet this requirement.  
    
4.1.4. FA Connectivity Verification 
 
   Once fully provisioned, FA liveliness may be achieved by verifying 
   its data plane connectivity. 
    
   FA connectivity verification relies on technology specific mechanisms 
   (e.g. for SDH, G.707, G.783, for MPLS, BFD, etc.) as for any other 
   LSP. Hence this requirement is out of the scope of GMPLS protocols. 
    
   Note that the time to establish the FA-LSP must be minimized. 
 
4.2. Multi-Region Specific Aspects 
    
4.2.1. Support for Multi-Region Signaling 
    
   Applying the triggered signaling procedure discussed above, in a MRN 
   environment may lead to the setup of one-hop FA-LSPs between each 
   node. Therefore, considering that the path computation is able to 
   take into account richness of information with regard to the 
   Switching Capability (SC) available on given nodes belonging to the 
   path, it is consistent to provide enough signaling information to 
   indicate the SC to be used and on over which link.   
        
   Limited extension to existing GMPLS signaling procedures is required 
   for this purpose as it only mandates indication of the SCs to be 
   included or excluded before initiating the LSP provisioning procedure. 
   This enhancement would solve the ambiguous choice of SC that are

   potentially used along a given path, particularly in case of ERO 
   expansion, or when an ERO sub-object identifies a multi-SC TE-link. 
   This would give the possibility to optimize resource usage on a 
   multi-region basis. 
 
4.2.2. Advertisement of Internal Adaptation Capabilities 
 
   In the MRN context, nodes supporting more than one switching 
   capability on at least one interface are called Hybrid nodes. Hybrid 
   nodes contain at least two distinct switching elements that are 
   interconnected by internal links to provide adaptation between the 
   supported switching capabilities.  
   These internal links have finite capacities and must be taken into   
   account when computing the path of a multi-region TE-LSP.  
   The advertisement of the internal adaptation capability is required 
   as it provides critical information when performing multi-region path 
   computation. 
 
   Figure 1a below shows an example of hybrid node. The hybrid node has 
   two switching elements (matrices), which support here TDM and PSC 
   switching respectively. The node terminates two PSC and TDM ports 
   (port1 and port2 respectively). It also has internal link connecting 
   the two switching elements.  
   The two switching elements are internally interconnected in such a 
   way that it is possible to terminate some of the resources of the TDM 
   port 2 and provide through them adaptation for PSC traffic, 
   received/sent over the internal PSC interface (#b). Two ways are 
   possible to set up PSC LSPs (port 1 or port 2). Available resources 
   advertisement e.g. Unreserved and Min/Max LSP Bandwidth should cover 
   both ways.

   Let's assume that all interfaces are STM16 (with VC4-16c capable  
   as Max LSP bandwidth). After, setting up several PSC LSPs via port #a 
   and setting up and terminating several TDM LSPs via port #d and port 
   #b, there is only 155 Mb capacities still available on port #b. 
   However a 622 Mb capacity remains on port #a and VC4-5c capacity on 
   port #d. 
    
   When computing the path for a new VC4-4c TDM LSP, one must know, that 
   this node cannot terminate this LSP, as there is only 155Mb still 
   available for TDM-PSC adaptation. Hence the internal TDM-PSC 
   adaptation capability must be advertised. 
    
   With current GMPLS routing [GMPLS-RTG] this advertisement is possible 
   if link bundling is not used and if two TE-links are advertised for 
   link1: 
    
   We would have the following TE-link advertisements: 
   TE-link 1 (port 1):  
        - ISCD #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = VC4-4c,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = vc4-5c. 
        - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 155 Mb,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = 155 Mb.  
    
   TE-Link 2 (port 2): 
         - ISCD sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 622Mb, unreserved    
                         bandwidth = 622Mb.

   The ISCD 2 in TE-link 1 represents actually the internal TDM-PSC 
   adaptation capability. 
    
   However if for obvious scalability reasons link bundling is done then 
   the adaptation capability information is lost with current GMPLS 
   routing, as we have the following TE-link advertisement: 
    
   TE-link 1 (port 1 + port 2):  
        - ISCD #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = VC4-4c,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = vc4-5c. 
        - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 622 Mb,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = 777 Mb.  
    
   With such TE-link advertisement an element computing the path of a 
   VC4-4C LSP cannot know that this LSP cannot be terminated on the 
   node. 
    
   Thus current GMPLS routing can support the advertisement of the 
   internal adaptation capability but this precludes performing link 
   bundling and thus faces significant scalability limitations.  
    
   Hence, GMPLS routing must be extended to meet this requirement. This 
   could rely on the advertisement of the internal adaptation 
   capabilities as a new TE link attribute (that would complement the 
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor TE-link attribute).

5. Evaluation Conclusion 
 
   Most of MLN/MRN requirements will rely on mechanisms and procedures 
   that are out of the scope of the GMPLS protocols, and thus do not 
   require any GMPLS protocol extensions. They will rely on local 
   procedures and policies, and on specific TE mechanisms and 
   algorithms. 
    
   As regards Virtual Network Topology (VNT) computation and 
   reconfiguration, specific TE mechanisms that could for instance rely 
   on PCE based mechanisms and protocols, need to be defined, but these 
   mechanisms are out of the scope of GMPLS protocols. 
    
   Four areas for extensions of GMPLS protocols and procedures have been 
   identified: 
    
        - GMPLS signaling extension for the setup/deletion of    
          the virtual TE-links (as well as exact trigger for its actual  
          provisioning); 
    
        - GMPLS routing and signaling extension for graceful TE-link  
          deletion; 
 
        - GMPLS signaling extension for constrained multi-region  
          signaling (SC inclusion/exclusion); 
    
        - GMPLS routing extension for the advertisement of the  
          internal adaptation capability of hybrid nodes. 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document specifically addresses GMPLS control plane   
   functionality for MLN/MRN in the context of a single administrative 
   control plane partition and hence does not introduce additional 
   security threats beyond those described in [RFC3945].
