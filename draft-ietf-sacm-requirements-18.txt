1.  Introduction

   Today's environment of rapidly-evolving security threats highlights
   the need to automate the sharing of security information (such as
   posture information) while protecting user information and the
   systems that store, process, and transmit this information.  Security
   threats can be detected in a number of ways.  The Secure Automation
   and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) charter focuses on how to collect
   and share this information based on use cases that involve posture
   assessment of endpoints.

   Scalable and sustainable collection, expression, and evaluation of
   endpoint information is foundational to SACM's objectives.  To secure
   and defend a network, one must reliably determine what devices are on
   the network, how those devices are configured from a hardware
   perspective, what software products are installed on those devices,
   and how those products are configured.  We need to be able to
   determine, share, and use this information in a secure, timely,
   consistent, and automated manner to perform endpoint posture
   assessments.

   This document focuses on describing the requirements for facilitating
   the exchange of posture assessment information in the enterprise, in
   particular, for the use cases as exemplified in [RFC7632].  As
   proposals are evaluated for SACM standardization, their drafts are
   expected to include a section that describe how they address each of
   the enumerated requirements.

   Also, this document uses terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   Use of each capitalized word within a sentence or phrase carries the
   following meaning during the SACM WG's protocol selection process:

    MUST - indicates an absolute requirement

    MUST NOT - indicates something absolutely prohibited

    SHOULD - indicates a strong recommendation of a desired result

    SHOULD NOT - indicates a strong recommendation against a result

    MAY - indicates a willingness to allow an optional outcome

   When the words appear in lower case, their natural language meaning
   is used.

2.  Requirements

   This document defines requirements based on the SACM use cases
   described in [RFC7632].  This section describes the requirements used
   by SACM to assess and compare candidate data models, interfaces, and
   protocols.  These requirements express characteristics or features
   that a candidate protocol, information model, or data model must be
   capable of offering to ensure security and interoperability.

   Multiple data models, protocols, and transfers may be employed in a
   SACM environment.  A SACM transfer protocol is one that runs on top
   of transport layer protocols such as TCP/IP or internet layer
   protocols such as HTTP, carries operations (requests / responses),
   and moves data.

   SACM will define an architecture and information model focused on
   addressing the needs for determining, sharing, and using posture
   information via Posture Information Providers and Posture Information
   Consumers securely.  With the information model defining assets and
   attributes to facilitate the guidance, collection, and assessment of
   posture, tasks that should be considered include:

   1.  Asset Classification: Map the target endpoint and/or the assets
       on the target endpoints to asset classes.  This enables
       identification of the attributes needed to exchange information
       pertaining to the target endpoint.

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


   2.  Attribute Definition: Define the attributes desired to be
       collected from each target endpoint.  For instance, organizations
       will want to know what software is installed and its critical
       security attributes such as patch level.

   3.  Policy Definition: This is where an organization can express its
       policy for acceptable or problematic values of an endpoint
       attribute.  The expected values of an endpoint attribute are
       determined for later comparison against the actual endpoint
       attribute values during the evaluation process.  Expected values
       may include both those values which are good as well as those
       values which represent problems, such as vulnerabilities.  The
       organization can also specify the endpoint attributes that are to
       be present for a given target endpoint.

   4.  Information Collection: Collect information (attribute values)
       from the target endpoint to populate the endpoint data.

   5.  Endpoint Assessment: Evaluate the actual values of the endpoint
       attributes against those expressed in the policy.  (An evaluation
       result may become additional endpoint data).

   6.  Result Reporting: Report the results of the evaluation for use by
       other components.  Examples of use of a report would be
       additional evaluation, network enforcement, vulnerability
       detection, and license management.

2.1.  Requirements for SACM

   Many deployment scenarios can be instantiated to address the above
   tasks and use cases defined in [RFC7632].  To ensure
   interoperability, scalability, and flexibility in any of these
   deployments, the following requirements are defined for proposed SACM
   standards:

   G-001  Solution Extensibility: The information model, data models,
    protocols, and transfers defined by SACM MUST be designed to allow
    support for future (SACM) extensions.  SACM MUST allow for both
    standardized and proprietary extensions.



    1.  The information model and programmatic interfaces (see G-012 for
        one example) MUST support the ability to add new operations
        while maintaining backwards compatibility.  SACM-defined
        transfer protocols MUST have extensibility to allow them to
        transfer operations that are defined in the future.

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


    2.  The query language MUST allow for general inquiries, as well as
        expression of specific attributes or relationships between
        attributes; the retrieval of specific information based on an
        event, or on a continuous basis; and the ability to retrieve
        specific pieces of information, specific types or classes of
        information, or the entirety of available information.

    3.  The information model MUST accommodate the interoperable
        addition of new data types and/or schemas.

   G-002  Interoperability: The data models, protocols, and transpors
    MUST be specified with enough details to ensure interoperability.

   G-003  Scalability: SACM needs to support a broad set of deployment
    scenarios.  The data models, protocols, and transports has to be
    scalable unless they are specifically defined to apply to a special-
    purpose scenario, such as constrained devices.  A SACM transfer
    protocol standard SHOULD include a section on scalability
    considerations that addresses the number of endpoints and amount of
    information to which it can reasonably be expected to scale.
    Scalability must be addressed to support:



    *  Large message: It is possible that the size of posture assessment
       information can vary from a single assessment that is small in
       size to a very large message or a very large set of assessments
       (up to multiple gigabytes in size).

    *  Large number of messages per second: A deployment may involve
       many rapid or simultaneous events that require processing,
       generating many messages per second.

    *  Large number of providers and consumers: A deployment may consist
       of a very large number of endpoints requesting and/or producing
       posture assessment information.

    *  Large number of target endpoints: A deployment may be managing
       information of a very large number of target endpoints.

   G-004  Versatility: The data model, protocols, and transports must be
    suitably specified to enable implementations to fit into different
    deployment models and scenarios, including considerations for
    implementations of data models and transports operating in
    constrained environments.  Separate solutions may be necessary to
    meet the needs of specific deployment models and scenarios.

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


   G-005  Information Extensibility: Non-standard (implementation-
    specific) attributes MUST be supported.  A method SHOULD be defined
    for preventing collisions from occurring in the naming of all
    attributes independent of their source.  For interoperability and
    scope boundary, the information model MUST define the mandatory set
    of attributes.

   G-006  Data Protection: To protect the information being shared, SACM
    components MUST protect the integrity and confidentiality of data in
    transit (end to end) and data at rest (as information is stored in
    repositories).  Mechanisms for this protection are unspecified but
    should include industry best practices.  These mechanisms are
    required to be available (i.e. all data-handling components must
    support them), but are not required to be used in all cases.

   G-007  Data Partitioning: A method for partitioning data MUST be
    supported to accommodate considerations such as geographic,
    regulatory, operational requirements, overlay boundaries, and
    federation (where the data may be collected in multiple locations
    and either centralized or kept in the local region).  Where
    replication of data is supported, it is required that methods exist
    to prevent update loops.

   G-008  Versioning and Backward Compatibility: Announcement and
    negotiation of versions, inclusive of existing capabilities (such as
    transfer protocols, data models, specific attributes within data
    models, standard attribute expression sets, etc.)  MUST be
    supported.  Negotiation for both versioning and capabilities is
    needed to accommodate future growth and ecosystems with mixed
    capabilities.

   G-009  Information Discovery: There MUST be mechanisms for components
    to discover what information is available across the ecosystem (i.e.
    a method for cataloging data available in the ecosystem and
    advertising it to consumers), where to go to get a specific piece of
    that information (i.e. which provider has the information), and what
    schemas are in use for organizing the information.  For example,
    providing a method by which a node can locate the advertised
    information so that consumers are not required to have a priori
    knowledge to find available information.

   G-010  Target Endpoint Discovery: SACM MUST define the means by which
    target endpoints may be discovered.  Use Case 2.1.2 describes the
    need to discover endpoints and their composition.

   G-011  Push and Pull Access: Three methods of data access MUST be
    supported: a Pull model, a solicited Push model, and an unsolicited
    Push models.  All of the methods of data access MUST support the

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


    ability for the initiator to filter the set of posture assessment
    information to be delivered.  Additionally, the provider of the
    information MUST be able to filter the set of posture assessment
    information based on the permissions of the recipient.  This
    requirement is driven by use cases 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.5.

   G-012  SACM Component Interface: The interfaces by which SACM
    components communicate to share endpoint posture information MUST be
    well defined.  That is, the interface defines the data model, SACM
    transfer protocols, and network transfer protocols to enable SACM
    components to communicate.

   G-013  Endpoint Location and Network Topology: The SACM architecture
    and interfaces MUST allow for the target endpoint (network) location
    and network topology to be modeled and understood.  Where
    appropriate, the data model and the interfaces SHOULD allow for
    discovery of the target endpoint location or network topology or
    both.

   G-014  Target Endpoint Identity: The SACM architecture and interfaces
    MUST support the ability of components to provide attributes that
    can be used to compose an identity for a target endpoint.  These
    identities MAY be composed of attributes from one or more SACM
    components.

   G-015  Data Access Control: Methods of access control must be
    supported to accommodate considerations such as geographic,
    regulatory, operational and federations.  Entities accessing or
    publishing data MUST identify themselves and pass access policy.

2.2.  Requirements for the Architecture

   Following are the requirements for the SACM architecture:

   ARCH-001  Component functions: At the simplest abstraction, the SACM
    architecture MUST represent the core components and interfaces
    needed to perform the production and consumption of posture
    assessment information.

   ARCH-002  Scalability: The architectural components MUST account for
    a range of deployments, from very small sets of endpoints to very
    large deployments.

   ARCH-003  Flexibility: The architectural components MUST account for
    different deployment scenarios where the architectural components
    may be implemented, deployed, or used within a single application,
    service, or network, or may comprise a federated system.

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


   ARCH-004  Separation of Data and Management Functions: SACM MUST
    define both the configuration and management of the SACM data models
    and protocols used to transfer and share posture assessment
    information.

   ARCH-005  Topology Flexibility: Both centralized and decentralized
    (peer-to-peer) information exchange MUST be supported.  Centralized
    data exchange enables use of a common data format to bridge together
    data exchange between diverse systems, and can leverage a virtual
    data store that centralizes and offloads all data access, storage,
    and maintenance to a dedicated resource.  Decentralized data
    exchange enables simplicity of sharing data between relatively
    uniform systems, and between small numbers of systems, especially
    within a single enterprise domain.  The fact that a centralized or
    decentralized deployment is used SHOULD be invisible to a consumer.
    However, there may be cases where the producer chooses to include
    that information due to consumer preference

   ARCH-006  Capability Negotiation: Announcement and negotiation of
    functional capabilities (such as authentication protocols,
    authorization schemes, data models, transfer protocols, etc.)  MUST
    be supported, enabling a SACM component to make inquiries about the
    capabilities of other components in the SACM ecosystem.

   ARCH-007  Role-based Authorization: The SACM architecture MUST be
    capable of effecting role-based authorization.  Distinction of
    endpoints capable of and authorized to provide or consume
    information is required to address appropriate access controls.

   ARCH-008  Context-based Authorization: The SACM architecture MUST be
    capable of effecting context-based authorization.  Different
    policies (e.g. business, regulatory, etc.) might specify what data
    may be exposed to, or shared by, consumers based on one or more
    attributes of the consumer.  The policy might specify that consumers
    are required to share specific information either back to the system
    or to administrators.

   ARCH-009  Time Synchronization: Actions or decisions based on time-
    sensitive data (such as user logon/logoff, endpoint connection/
    disconnection, endpoint behavior events, etc.) are all predicated on
    a synchronized understanding of time.  The SACM architecture MUST
    provide a mechanism for all components to synchronize time.  A
    mechanism for detecting and reporting time discrepancies SHOULD be
    provided by the architecture and reflected in the information model.

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


2.3.  Requirements for the Information Model

   The SACM information model represents the abstracted representation
   for Posture Assessment information to be communicated.  SACM data
   models must adhere to and comply with the SACM information model.
   The requirements for the SACM information model include:

   IM-001  Extensible Attribute Vocabulary: The information model MUST
    define a minimum set of attributes for communicating Posture
    Information, to ensure interoperability between data models.
    (Individual data models may define attributes beyond the mandatory-
    to-implement minimum set.)  The attributes should be defined with a
    clear mechanism for extensibility to enable data models to adhere to
    SACM's required attributes as well as allow for their own
    extensions.  The attribute vocabulary should be defined with a clear
    mechanism for extensibility to enable future versions of the
    information model to be interoperably expanded with new attributes.

   IM-002  Posture Data Publication: The information model MUST allow
    for the data to be provided by a SACM component either solicited or
    unsolicited.  No aspect of the information model should be dependent
    upon or assume a push or pull model of publication.

   IM-003  Data Model Negotiation: SACM's information model MUST allow
    support for different data models, data model versions, and
    different versions of the operations on the data models and transfer
    protocols.  The SACM information model MUST include the ability to
    discover and negotiate the use of a particular data model or any
    data model.

   IM-004  Data Model Identification: The information model MUST provide
    a means to uniquely identify each data model.  The identifier MUST
    contain both an identifier of the data model and a version indicator
    for the data model.  The identifiers SHOULD be decomposable so that
    a customer can query for any version of a specific data model and
    compare returned values for older or newer than a desired version.

   IM-005  Data Lifetime Management: The information model MUST provide
    a means to allow data models to include data lifetime management.
    The information model must identify attributes that can allow data
    models to, at minimum, identify the data's origination time and
    expected time of next update or data longevity (how long should the
    data be assumed to still be valid).

   IM-006  Singularity and Modularity: The SACM information model MUST
    be singular (i.e. there is only one information model, not multiple
    alternative information models from which to choose) and MAY be
    modular (a conjunction of several sub-components) for ease of



Cam-Winget & Lorenzin   Expires February 2, 2018                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


    maintenance and extension.  For example, endpoint identification
    could be an independent sub-component of the information model, to
    simplify updating of endpoint identification attributes.

2.4.  Requirements for the Data Model

   The SACM information model represents an abstraction for "what"
   information can be communicated and "how" it is to be represented and
   shared.  It is expected that as applications may produce posture
   assessment information, they may share it using a specific data
   model.  Similarly, applications consuming or requesting posture
   assessment information, may require it be based on a specific data
   model.  Thus, while there may exist different data models and
   schemas, they should adhere to the SACM information model and meet
   the requirements defined in this section.

   The specific requirements for candidate data models include:

   DM-001  Element Association: A SACM Information Model consists of a
    set of SACM Information Model elements.  A SACM Data Model MUST be
    derived from the SACM Information Model.  A SACM Data Model consists
    of a set of SACM Data Model elements.  In this derivation, a SACM
    Data Model element MAY map to one or more SACM Information Model
    elements.  In addition, a SACM Data Model MAY include additional
    Data Model elements that are not associated with any SACM
    Information Model elements.

   DM-002  Data Model Structure: The data model can be structured either
    as one single module or separated into modules and sub-modules that
    allow for references between them.  The data model structure MAY
    reflect structure in the information model, but does not need to.
    For example, the data model might use one module to define
    endpoints, and that module might reference other modules that
    describe the various assets associated with the endpoint.
    Constraints and interfaces might further be defined to resolve or
    tolerate ambiguity in the references (e.g. same IP address used in
    two separate networks).

   DM-003  Search Flexibility: The search interfaces and actions MUST
    include the ability to start a search anywhere within a data model
    structure, and the ability to search based on patterns ("wildcard
    searches") as well as specific data elements.

   DM-004  Full vs. Partial Updates: The data model SHOULD include the
    ability to allow providers of data to provide the data as a whole,
    or when updates occur.  For example, a consumer can request a full
    update on initial engagement, then request to receive deltas




Cam-Winget & Lorenzin   Expires February 2, 2018               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


    (updates containing only the changes since the last update) on an
    ongoing basis as new data is generated.

   DM-005  Loose Coupling: The data model SHOULD allow for a loose
    coupling between the provider and the consumer, such that the
    consumer can request information without being required to request
    it from a specific provider, and a provider can publish information
    without having a specific consumer targeted to receive it.

   DM-006  Data Cardinality: The data model MUST describe their
    constraints (e.g. cardinality).  As posture information and the
    tasks for collection, aggregation, or evaluation, could comprise one
    or more attributes, interfaces and actions MUST allow and account
    for such cardinality as well as whether the attributes are
    conditional, optional, or mandatory.

   DM-007  Data Model Negotiation: The interfaces and actions in the
    data model MUST include capability negotiation to enable discovery
    of supported and available data types and schemas.

   DM-008  Data Origin: The data model MUST include the ability for
    consumers to identify the data origin (provider that collected the
    data).

   DM-009  Origination Time: The data model SHOULD allow the provider to
    include the information's origination time.

   DM-010  Data Generation: The data model MUST allow the provider to
    include attributes defining how the data was generated (e.g. self-
    reported, reported by aggregator, scan result, etc.).

   DM-011  Data Source: The data model MUST allow the provider to
    include attributes identifying the data source (target endpoint from
    which the data was collected) - e.g. hostname, domain (DNS) name or
    application name.

   DM-012  Data Updates: The data model SHOULD allow the provider to
    include attributes defining whether the information provided is a
    delta, partial, or full set of information.

   DM-013  Multiple Collectors: The data model MUST support the
    collection of attributes by a variety of collectors, including
    internal collectors, external collectors with an authenticated
    relationship with the endpoint, and external collectors based on
    network and other observers.

   DM-014  Attribute Extensibility: Use Cases in the whole of Section 2
    describe the need for an attribute dictionary.  With SACM's scope

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


    focused on posture assessment, the data model attribute collection
    and aggregation MUST have a well-understood set of attributes
    inclusive of their meaning or usage intent.  The data model MUST
    include all attributes defined in the information model and MAY
    include additional attributes beyond those found in the information
    model.  Additional attributes MUST be defined in accordance with the
    extensibility framework provided in the information model (see IM-
    001).

   DM-015  Solicited vs. Unsolicited Updates: The data model MUST enable
    a provider to publish data either solicited (in response to a
    request from a consumer) or unsolicited (as new data is generated,
    without a request required).  For example, an external collector can
    publish data in response to a request by a consumer for information
    about an endpoint, or can publish data as it observes new
    information about an endpoint, without any specific consumer request
    triggering the publication; a compliance-server provider may publish
    endpoint posture information in response to a request from a
    consumer (solicited), or it may publish posture information driven
    by a change in the posture of the endpoint (unsolicited).

   DM-016  tTransfer Agnostic: The data model MUST be transfer agnostic,
    to allow for the data operations to leverage the most appropriate
    SACM transfer protocol.

2.5.  Requirements for Data Model Operations

   Posture information data adhering to a data model must also provide
   interfaces that include operations for access and production of the
   data.  Operations requirements are distinct from transfer
   requirements in that operations requirements are requirements on the
   application performing requests and responses, whereas transfer
   requirements are requirements on the transfer protocol carrying the
   requests / responses.  The specific requirements for such operations
   include:

   OP-001  Time Synchronization: Request and response operations MUST be
    timestamped, and published information SHOULD capture time of
    publication.  Actions or decisions based on time-sensitive data
    (such as user logon/logoff, endpoint connection/disconnection,
    endpoint behavior events, etc.) are all predicated on a synchronized
    understanding of time.  A method for detecting and reporting time
    discrepancies SHOULD be provided.

   OP-002  Collection Abstraction: Collection is the act of a SACM
    component gathering data from a target endpoint.  The request for a
    data item MUST include enough information to properly identify the
    item to collect, but the request shall not be a command to directly



Cam-Winget & Lorenzin   Expires February 2, 2018               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


    execute nor directly be applied as arguments to a command.  The
    purpose of this requirement is primarily to reduce the potential
    attack vectors, but has the additional benefit of abstracting the
    request for collection from the collection method, thereby allowing
    more flexibility in how collection is implemented.

   OP-003  Collection Composition: A collection request MAY be composed
    of multiple collection requests (which yield collected values).  The
    desire for multiple values MUST be expressed as part of the
    collection request, so that the aggregation can be resolved at the
    point of collection without having to interact with the requestor.
    This requirement should not be interpreted as preventing a collector
    from providing attributes which were not part of the original
    request.

   OP-004  Attribute-based Query: A query operation is the act of
    requesting data from a provider.  Query operations SHOULD be based
    on a set of attributes.  Query operations MUST support both a query
    for specific attributes and a query for all attributes.  Use Case
    2.1.2 describes the need for the data model to support a query
    operation based on a set of attributes to facilitate collection of
    information such as posture assessment, inventory (of endpoints or
    endpoint components), and configuration checklist.

   OP-005  Information-based Query with Filtering: The query operation
    MUST support filtering.  Use Case 2.1.3 describes the need for the
    data model to support the means for the information to be collected
    through a query mechanism.  Furthermore, the query operation
    requires filtering capabilities to allow for only a subset of
    information to be retrieved.  The query operation MAY be a
    synchronous request or asynchronous request.

   OP-006  Operation Scalability: The operation resulting from a query
    operation MUST be able to handle the return and receipt of large
    amounts of data.  Use Cases 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 describe the need for
    the data model to support scalability.  For example, the query
    operation may result in a very large set of attributes, as well as a
    large set of targets.

   OP-007  Data Abstraction: The data model MUST allow a SACM component
    to communicate what data was used to construct the target endpoint's
    identity, so other SACM components can determine whether they are
    constructing an equivalent target endpoint (and its identity) and
    whether they have confidence in that identity.  SACM components
    SHOULD have interfaces defined to transmit this data directly or to
    refer to where the information can be retrieved.

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


   OP-008  Provider Restriction: Request operations MUST include the
    ability to restrict the data to be provided by a specific provider
    or a provider with specific characteristics.  Response operations
    MUST include the ability to identify the provider that supplied the
    response.  For example, a SACM Consumer should be able to request
    that all of the data come from a specific provider by identity (e.g.
    Provider A) or from a Provider that is in a specific location (e.g.
    in the Boston office).

2.6.  Requirements for SACM Transfer Protocols

   The term SACM transfer protocol is intended to be distinguished from
   underlying transport and internet layer protocols such as TCP/IP or
   operating at an equivalent level as the HTTP.  The SACM transfer
   protocol is focused on moving data and performing necessary access
   control operations; it is agnostic to the data model operations.

   The requirements for SACM transfer protocols include:

   T-001  Multiple transfer Protocol Support: SACM transfer protocols
    will vary depending on the deployment model that relies on different
    transfer layer requirements, different device capabilities, and
    system configurations dealing with connectivity.  For example, where
    posture attributes may be collected directly from an endpoint using
    NEA's model [RFC5209], different transports may be defined to
    collect them using PT-EAP [RFC7171] or PT-TLS [RFC6876] depending on
    the deployment scenario.

   T-002  Data Integrity: SACM transfer protocols MUST be able to ensure
    data integrity for data in transit.

   T-003  Data Confidentiality: SACM transfer protocols MUST be able to
    support data confidentiality.  SACM transfer protocols MUST ensure
    data protection for data in transit (e.g. by encryption) to provide
    confidentiality, integrity, and robustness against protocol-based
    attacks.  Note that while the transfer MUST be able to support data
    confidentiality, implementations MAY provide a configuration option
    that enables and disables confidentiality in deployments.
    Protection for data at rest is not in scope for transfer protocols.
    Data protection MAY be used for both privacy and non-privacy
    scenarios.

   T-004  Transfer Protection: SACM transfer protocols MUST be capable
    of supporting mutual authentication and replay protection.

   T-005  Transfer Reliability: SACM transfer protocols MUST provide
    reliable delivery of data.  This includes the ability to perform
    fragmentation and reassembly, and to detect replays.  The SACM

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


    transfer may take advantage of reliability features in the network
    transport; however, the network transport may be unreliable (e.g.
    UDP), in which case the SACM transfer running over the unreliable
    network transport is responsible for ensuring reliability (i.e. by
    provisions such as confirmations and re-transmits).

   T-006  Transfer Layer Requirements: Each SACM transfer protocol MUST
    clearly specify the transport layer requirements it needs to operate
    correctly.  Examples of items that may need to be specified include
    connectivity requirements, replay requirements, data link encryption
    requirements, and/or channel binding requirements.  These
    requirements are needed in order for deployments to be done
    correctly.

   T-007  Transfer Protocol adoption: SACM SHOULD where reasonably
    possible, leverage and use existing IETF transfer protocols versus
    defining new ones.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines the requirements for SACM.  As such, it is
   expected that several data models, protocols, and transfer protocols
   may be defined or reused from already existing standards.

   To address security and privacy considerations, the data model,
   protocols, and transports must consider authorization based on
   consumer function and privileges, to only allow authorized consumers
   and providers to access specific information being requested or
   published.

   To enable federation across multiple entities (such as across
   organizational or geographic boundaries) authorization must also
   extend to infrastructure elements themselves, such as central
   controllers / brokers / data repositories.

   In addition, authorization needs to extend to specific information or
   resources available in the environment.  In other words,



Cam-Winget & Lorenzin   Expires February 2, 2018               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


   authorization is based on the subject (the information requestor),
   the provider (the information responder), the object (the endpoint
   the information is being requested on), and the attribute (what piece
   of data is being requested).  The method by which this authorization
   is applied is unspecified.

   SACM's charter focuses on the workflow orchestration and the sharing
   of posture information for improving efficacy of security
   applications such as compliance, configuration, assurance and other
   threat and vulnerability reporting and remediation systems.  While
   the goal is to facilitate the flow of information securely, it is
   important to note that participating endpoints may not be cooperative
   or trustworthy.

5.1.  Trust between Provider and Requestor

   The information given from the provider to a requestor may come with
   different levels of trustworthiness given the different potential
   deployment scenarios and compromise either at the provider, the
   requesting consumer, or devices that are involved in the transfer
   between the provider and requestor.  This section will describe the
   different considerations that may reduce the level of trustworthiness
   of the information provided.

   In the information transfer flow, it is possible that some of the
   devices may serve as proxies or brokers and as such, may be able to
   observe the communications flowing between an information provider
   and requestor.  Without appropriate protections, it is possible for
   these proxies and brokers to inject and affect man-in-the-middle
   attacks.

   It is common to, in general, distrust the network service provider,
   unless the full hop by hop communications process flow is well
   understood.  As such, the posture information provider should protect
   the posture information data it provides as well as the transfer it
   uses.  Similarly, while there may be providers whose goal is to
   openly share its information, there may also be providers whose
   policy is to grant access to certain posture information based on its
   business or regulatory policy.  In those situations, a provider may
   require full authentication and authorization of the requestor (or
   set of requestors) and share only the authorized information to the
   authenticated and authorized requestors.

   A requestor beyond distrusting the network service provider, must
   also account that the information received from the provider may have
   been communicated through an undetermined network communications
   system.  That is, the posture information may have traversed through
   many devices before reaching the requestor.  SACM specifications



Cam-Winget & Lorenzin   Expires February 2, 2018               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


   should provide the means for verifying data origin and data integrity
   and at minimum, provide endpoint authentication and transfer
   integrity.

   A requestor may require data freshness indications, both knowledge of
   data origination as well as time of publication so that it can make
   more informed decisions about the relevance of the data based on its
   currency and/or age.

   It is also important to note that endpoint assessment reports,
   especially as they may be provided by the target endpoint may pose
   untrustworthy information.  The considerations for this are described
   in Section 8 of [RFC5209].

   The trustworthiness of the posture information given by the provider
   to one or many requestors is dependent on several considerations.
   Some of these include the requestor requiring:

   o  Full disclosure of the network topology path to the provider(s).

   o  Direct (peer to peer) communication with the provider.

   o  Authentication and authorization of the provider.

   o  Either or both confidentiality and integrity at the transfer
      layer.

   o  Either or both confidentiality and integrity at the data layer.

5.2.  Privacy Considerations

   SACM information may contain sensitive information about the target
   endpoint as well as revealing identity information of the producer or
   consumer of such information.  Similarly, as part of the SACM
   discovery mechanism, the advertised capabilities (and roles, e.g.
   SACM components enabled) by the endpoint may be construed as private
   information.

   In addition to identity and SACM capabilities information disclosure,
   the use of time stamps (or other attributes that can be used as
   identifiers) could be further used to determine a target endpoint or
   user's behavioral patterns.  Such attributes may also be deemed
   sensitive and may required further protection or obfuscation to meet
   privacy concerns.  That is, there may be applications as well as
   business and regulatory practices that require that aspects of such
   information be hidden from any parties that do not need to know it.

Internet-Draft              SACM Requirements                August 2017


   Data confidentiality can provide some level of privacy but may fall
   short where unnecessary data is still transmitted.  In those cases,
   filtering requirements at the data model such as OP-005 must be
   applied to ensure that such data is not disclosed.  [RFC6973]
   provides guidelines for which SACM protocols and information and data
   models should follow.
