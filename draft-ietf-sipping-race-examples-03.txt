Internet-Draft    Examples call flow in race condition       August 2007


1.  Overview

   The call flows shown in this document were developed in the design of
   a SIP IP communications network.  These examples are of race
   condition, which stems from the dialog state transition mainly
   established by INVITE.

   When implementing SIP, various complex situations may arise.
   Therefore, it will be helpful to provide implementors of the protocol
   with examples of recommended terminal and server behavior.

   This document clarifies SIP UA behaviors when messages cross each
   other as race conditions.  By clarifying operation under race
   conditions, inconsistent interpretations between implementations are
   avoided and interoperability is expected to be promoted.

   It is the hope of the authors that this document will be useful for
   SIP implementors, designers, and protocol researchers and will help
   them achieve the goal of a standard implementation of RFC 3261 [1].

   These call flows are based on the version 2.0 of SIP defined in RFC
   3261 [1] with SDP usage described in RFC 3264 [2].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [3].

1.1.  General Assumptions

   A number of architecture, network, and protocol assumptions underlie
   the call flows in this document.  Note that these assumptions are not
   requirements.  They are outlined in this section so that they may be
   taken into consideration and help understanding the call flow
   examples.

   These flows do not assume specific underlying transport protocols
   such as TCP, TLS, and UDP.  See the discussion in RFC 3261 [1] for
   details on the transport issues for SIP.

1.2.  Legend for Message Flows

   Dashed lines (---) and slash lines (/, \) represent signaling
   messages that are mandatory to the call scenario.  (X) represents
   crossover of signaling messages. (->x, x<-) indicate that the packet
   is lost.  The arrow indicates the direction of message flow.  Double
   dashed lines (===) represent media paths between network elements.

   Messages are identified in the figures as F1, F2, etc.  These numbers

   are used for references to the message details that follow the
   Figure.  Comments in the message details are shown in the following
   form:

   /* Comments.  */

1.3.  SIP Protocol Assumptions

   This document does not prescribe the flows precisely as they are
   shown, but rather illustrates the principles for best practice.  They
   are best practice usages (orderings, syntax, selection of features
   for the purpose, or handling of error) of SIP methods, headers and
   parameters.  Note: The flows in this document must not be copied as
   they are by implementors because additional characteristics were
   incorporated into the document for ease of explanation.  To sum up,
   the procedures described in this document represent well-reviewed
   examples of SIP usage, which are best common practice according to
   IETF consensus.

   For simplicity in reading and editing the document, there are a
   number of differences between some of the examples and actual SIP
   messages.  For instance, Call-IDs are often repeated, CSeq often
   begins at 1, header fields are usually shown in the same order,
   usually only the minimum required header field set is shown, and
   other headers which would usually be included such as Accept, Allow,
   etc. are not shown.

2.  The Dialog State Machine for INVITE dialog usage

   Race conditions are generated when the dialog state of the receiving
   side differs from that of the sending side.

   For instance, a race condition occurs when UAC (User Agent Client)
   sends a CANCEL in the Early state while UAS (User Agent Server) is
   transiting from the Early state to the Confirmed state by sending a
   200 OK to initial INVITE (indicated as "ini-INVITE" hereafter).  The
   DSM (dialog state machine) for the INVITE dialog usage is presented



Hasebe, et al.          Expires February 11, 2008               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Examples call flow in race condition       August 2007


   as follows to help understanding UA's behavior in race conditions.

   The DSM clarifies UA's behavior by subdividing the dialog state shown
   in RFC 3261 [1] into some internal states.  We call the state before
   a dialog establishment the Preparative state.  The Confirmed state is
   subdivided into two substates, the Moratorium and Established states,
   and the Terminated state is subdivided into the Mortal and Morgue
   states.  Messages which are the triggers of the state transitions
   between these states are indicated with arrows.  In this figure,
   messages which are not related to state transition are omitted.

   Below are the DSMs for UAC and UAS respectively.

   Caller MAY send a BYE in the Early state, even though this behavior
   is NOT RECOMMENDED.  The BYE sent in the Early state terminates the

   early dialog with a specific To tag.  That is, when a proxy is
   performing forking, the BYE is only able to terminate the early
   dialog with a particular UA.  If caller wants to terminate all early
   dialogs instead of that with a particular UA, it needs to send
   CANCEL, not BYE.  However, it is not illegal to send BYE in the Early
   state to terminate a specific early dialog according to the caller's
   intent.  Moreover, until caller receives a final response and
   terminates the INVITE transaction, the caller MUST be prepared to
   establish a dialog by receiving a new response to the INVITE even
   though it had sent a CANCEL or BYE and terminated the dialog (see
   Appendix A).

   transition by sending 487 immediately after the reception of the
   CANCEL.  Considering this, the behavior upon the reception of the
   CANCEL request is further explained in Appendix C.

   Following are UA's behaviors in each state.

   Preparative (Pre):  The Preparative state is a state until the early
      dialog is established by sending or receiving a provisional
      response with To tag after an ini-INVITE is sent or received.  The
      dialog has not existed yet in the Preparative state.  If UA sends
      or receives a 2xx response, the dialog state transit from the
      Preparative to the Moratorium state which is a substate of the
      Confirmed state.  In addition, if UA sends or receives a 3xx-6xx
      response the dialog state transit to the Morgue state which is a
      substate of the Terminated state.  Sending an ACK for a 3xx-6xx
      response and retransmissions of 3xx-6xx are not expressed on the
      DSMs because they are sent by the INVITE transaction.

   Early (Ear):  The early dialog is established by sending or receiving
      a provisional response with To tag.  The early dialog exists
      though the dialog does not exist in this state yet.  The dialog
      state transits from the Early to Moratorium state, a substate of
      the Confirmed state, by sending or receiving a 2xx response.  In
      addition, the dialog state transits to the Morgue state, a
      substate of the Terminated state, by sending or receiving a 3xx-
      6xx response.  Sending an ACK for a 3xx-6xx response and
      retransmissions of 3xx-6xx are not expressed on this DSM because
      they are automatically processed on transaction layer and don't
      influence the dialog state.  UAC may send CANCEL in the Early
      state.  UAC may send BYE (although it is not recommended).  UAS
      may send a 1xx-6xx response.  Sending or receiving of a CANCEL
      request does not have direct influences on dialog state.  The UA's
      behavior upon the reception of the CANCEL request is further
      explained in Appendix C.

   Confirmed (Con):  Sending or receiving of a 2xx final response
      establishes a dialog.  Dialog exists in this state.  The Confirmed
      state transits to the Mortal state, a substate of the Terminated
      state, by sending or receiving a BYE request.  The Confirmed state
      has two substates, the Moratorium and Established state, which are
      different in messages UAs are allowed to send.

   Moratorium (Mora):  The Moratorium state is a substate of the
      Confirmed state and inherits the behavior of the superstate.  The
      Moratorium state transits to the Established state by sending or
      receiving an ACK request.  UAC may send ACK and UAS may send a 2xx
      final response.

Internet-Draft    Examples call flow in race condition       August 2007


   Established (Est):  The Established state is a substate of the
      Confirmed state and inherits the behavior of superstate.  Both
      caller and callee may send various messages which influence a
      dialog.  Caller supports the transmission of ACK in response to
      retransmission of a 2xx response to an ini-INVITE.

   Terminated (Ter):  The Terminated state is divided into two
      substates, the Mortal and Morgue states, to cover the behavior
      when a dialog is being terminated.  In this state, UAs hold
      information about the dialog which is being terminated.

   Mortal (Mort):  Caller and callee enter the Mortal state by sending
      or receiving a BYE.  UA MUST NOT send any new requests within the
      dialog because there is no dialog.  (Here the new requests do not
      include ACK for 2xx and BYE for 401 or 407 as further explained in
      Appendix D below.)  In this state, only BYE or its response can be
      handled, and no other messages can be received.  This addresses
      the case where BYE is sent by both a caller and a callee to
      exchange reports about the session when it is being terminated.
      Therefore the UA possesses dialog information for internal
      processing but the dialog shouldn't be externally visible.  The UA
      stops managing its dialog state and changes it to the Morgue
      state, when the BYE transaction is terminated.

   Morgue (Morg):  The dialog no longer exists in this state.  Sending
      or receiving of signaling which influences a dialog is not
      performed.  (A dialog is literally terminated.)  Caller and callee
      enter the Morgue state via the termination of the BYE or INVITE
      transaction.


3.  Race Conditions

   This section details race condition between two SIP UAs, Alice and
   Bob. Alice (sip:alice@atlanta.example.com) and Bob
   (sip:bob@biloxi.example.com) are assumed to be SIP phones or SIP-
   enabled devices.  Only significant signaling is illustrated.  Dialog
   state transitions caused by sending or receiving of SIP messages as
   well as '*race*', which indicates race condition, are shown.  (For
   abbreviations for the dialog state transitions, refer to Section 2.)
   '*race*' indicates the moment when a race condition occurs.

   Examples of race conditions are shown below.

3.1.  Receiving message in the Moratorium State

   This section shows some examples of call flow in race condition when
   receiving the message from other states in the Moratorium state.

3.1.1.  Receiving Initial INVITE retransmission (Preparative state) in
        Moratorium state

   State  Alice                               Bob  State

          |                    X                |
          |                   / \               |
          |<-----------------     ------------->|  *race*
    Mora  |                ACK F5               |
          |------------------------------------>|
     Est  |                                     |  Est
          |                                     |

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives a Preparative message in the Moratorium state.  All
   provisional responses to the initial INVITE (ini-INVITE F1) are lost,
   and UAC retransmits an ini-INVITE (F4).  At the same time as
   retransmission, UAS generates a 200 OK (F3) to the ini-INVITE and it
   terminates an INVITE server transaction, according to Section
   13.3.1.4 of RFC 3261 [1].

   However, it is reported that terminating an INVITE server transaction
   by 200 OK is a SIP bug. (http://bugs.sipit.net, #769) Therefore, the
   INVITE server transaction is not terminated at F3, and the F4 MUST be
   properly handled as a retransmission.  (UAs that do not deal with
   this bug still need to recognize the dialog relying on its From tag
   and Call-ID, and the retransmitted request relying on the CSeq header
   field value even though it does not match the transaction.)

   In RFC 3261 [1], it is not specified whether UAS retransmits 200 to
   the retransmission of ini-INVITE.  Considering the retransmission of
   200 triggered by timer (TU keeps retransmitting 200 based on T1 and
   T2 until it receives an ACK), according to Section 13.3.1.4 of RFC
   3261 [1], it seems unnecessary to retransmit 200 when the UAS
   receives the retransmission of ini-INVITE.  (For implementation, it

   does not matter if the UAS sends the retransmission of 200, since the
   200 does not cause any problem.)

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Early message, CANCEL, in the Moratorium state.  Alice
   sends a CANCEL and Bob sends a 200 OK response to the initial INVITE
   message at the same time.  As described in the previous section,
   according to RFC 3261 [1], an INVITE server transaction is supposed
   to be terminated by a 200 response, but this has been reported as a
   bug #769.

   This section describes a case in which an INVITE server transaction
   is not terminated by a 200 response to the INVITE request.  In this



Hasebe, et al.          Expires February 11, 2008              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Examples call flow in race condition       August 2007


   case, there is an INVITE transaction which the CANCEL request
   matches, so a 200 response is sent to the request.  This 200 response
   simply means that the next hop received the CANCEL request
   (Successful CANCEL (200) does not mean an INVITE failure).  When UAS
   does not deal with #769, UAC MAY receive a 481 response for CANCEL
   since there is no transaction which the CANCEL request matches.  This
   481 simply means that there is no matching INVITE server transaction
   and CANCEL is not sent to the next hop.  Regardless of the success/
   failure of the CANCEL, Alice checks the final response to INVITE, and
   if she receives 200 to the INVITE request she immediately sends a BYE
   and terminates the dialog.  (Section 15, RFC 3261 [1])

   From the time F1 is received by Bob until the time that F8 is sent by
   Bob, media may be flowing one way from Bob to Alice.  From the time
   that an answer is received by Alice from Bob there is the possibility
   that media may flow from Alice to Bob as well.  However, once Alice
   has decided to cancel the call, she presumably will not send media,
   so practically speaking the media stream will remain one way.

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Early message, BYE, in the Moratorium state.  Alice sends
   a BYE in the Early state and Bob sends a 200 OK response to the
   initial INVITE request at the same time.  Bob receives the BYE in the
   Confirmed dialog state though Alice sent the request in the Early

   state (As explained in Section 2 and Appendix A, this behavior is NOT
   RECOMMENDED).  When a proxy is performing forking, the BYE is only
   able to terminate the early dialog with a particular UA.  If caller
   wants to terminate all early dialogs instead of that with a
   particular UA, it needs to send CANCEL, not BYE.  However, it is not
   illegal to send BYE in the Early state to terminate a specific early
   dialog according to the caller's intent.

   The BYE functions normally even if it is received after the INVITE
   transaction termination because BYE differs from CANCEL, and is sent
   not to the request but to the dialog.  Alice gets into the Mortal
   state on sending the BYE request, and remains Mortal until Timer K
   timeout occurs.  In the Mortal state, UAC does not establish a
   session, even though it receives a 200 response to INVITE.  Even so,
   the UAC sends an ACK to 200 for the completion of INVITE transaction.
   The ACK is always sent to complete the three-way handshake of INVITE
   transaction (Further explained in Appendix D below).

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives re-INVITE request sent from the Established state, in the
   Moratorium state.

   UAS receives a re-INVITE (w/offer2) before receiving an ACK for ini-
   INVITE (w/offer1).  UAS sends a 200 OK (w/answer2) to the re-INVITE
   (F8) because it has sent a 200 OK (w/answer1) to the ini-INVITE (F3,
   F5) and the dialog has already been established.  (Because F5 is a
   retransmission of F3, SDP negotiation is not performed here.)

   If a 200 OK to the ini-INVITE has an offer and the answer is in the
   ACK, it is recommended that UA return a 491 to the re-INVITE (refer
   to Section 3.1.5).  (Note: 500 with Retry-After header may be
   returned, if the 491 response is understood to indicate request



Hasebe, et al.          Expires February 11, 2008              [Page 17]

   collision.  However, 491 is recommended here because 500 applies to
   so many cases that it is difficult to determine what the real problem
   was.)  As it can be seen in Section 3.3.2 below, the 491 response
   seems to be closely related to session establishment, even in cases
   other than INVITE cross-over.  This example recommends 200 be sent
   instead of 491 because it does not have influence on session.
   However, a 491 response can also lead to the same outcome, so the
   either response can be used.

   Moreover, if UAS doesn't receive an ACK for a long time, it should
   send a BYE and terminate the dialog.  Note that ACK F7 has the same
   CSeq number as ini-INVITE F1 (See Section 13.2.2.4 of RFC 3261 [1]).
   The UA should not reject or drop the ACK on grounds of CSeq number.

   Note: There is a hint for implementation to avoid the race conditions
   of this type.  That is for the caller to delay sending re-INVITE F6
   for some period of time (2 seconds, perhaps), from which the caller
   is reasonably able to assume that its ACK has been received.
   Implementors can decouple the actions of the user (e.g. pressing the
   hold button) from the actions of the protocol (the sending of re-
   INVITE F6), so that the UA can behave as such.  In this case, it is
   dependent on the implementor's choice as to how long it waits.  In
   most cases, such implementation may be useful to prevent a type of
   race condition shown in this section.

   This scenario is basically the same as that of Section 3.1.4, but
   differs in sending an offer in 200 and an answer in ACK.  Different
   to the previous case, the offer in the 200 (F3) and the offer in the
   re-INVITE (F6) collide with each other.

   Bob sends 491 to re-INVITE (F6) since he is not able to properly
   handle a new request until he receives an answer.  (Note: 500 with
   Retry-After header may be returned, if the 491 response is understood
   to indicate request collision.  However, 491 is recommended here
   because 500 applies to so many cases that it is difficult to
   determine what the real problem was.)  Even if F6 is UPDATE with
   offer, it will reach the same result.

   Note: As noted in Section 3.1.4, it may be useful for the caller to
   delay sending re-INVITE F6 for some period of time (2 seconds,

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Established message, BYE, in the Moratorium state.  An
   ACK request for a 200 OK response is lost (or delayed).  Immediately
   after Bob retransmits the 200 OK to ini-INVITE, and Alice sends a BYE
   request at the same time.  Depending on the implementation of a SIP
   UA, Alice may start a session again by the reception of the
   retransmitted 200 OK with SDP since she has already terminated a
   session by sending a BYE.  In that case, when UAC receives a
   retransmitted 200 OK after sending a BYE, a session should not be
   started again since the session which is not associated with dialog
   still remains.  Moreover, in the case where UAS sends an offer in a
   200 OK, UAS should not start a session again for the same reason if
   UAS receives a retransmitted ACK after receiving a BYE.

   to avoid the race conditions of this type.  That is for the caller to
   delay sending BYE F6 for some period of time (2 seconds, perhaps),
   from which the caller is reasonably able to assume that its ACK has
   been received.  Implementors can decouple the actions of the user
   (e.g. hanging up) from the actions of the protocol (the sending of
   BYE F6), so that the UA can behave as such.  In this case, it is
   dependent on the implementor's choice as to how long it waits.  In
   most cases, such implementation may be useful to prevent a type of
   race condition shown in this section.

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Established message, BYE, in the Mortal state.  Alice and
   Bob send a BYE at the same time.  A dialog and session are ended

   shortly after a BYE request is passed to a client transaction.  As
   shown in Section 2, UA remains in the Mortal state.

   UAs in the Mortal state return error responses to the requests that
   operate dialog or session, such as re-INVITE, UPDATE, or REFER.
   However, UA shall return 200 OK to the BYE taking the use case into
   consideration where BYE request is sent by both a caller and a callee
   to exchange reports about the session when it is being terminated.
   (Since the dialogue and the session both terminate when a BYE is
   sent, the choice of sending 200 or an error response upon receiving
   BYE in the Mortal state does not affect the resulting termination.
   Therefore, even though this example uses a 200 response, other
   responses can also be used.)

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Established message, re-INVITE, in the Mortal state.  Bob
   sends a re-INVITE, and Alice sends a BYE at the same time.  The re-
   INVITE is responded by a 481, since the TU of Alice has transited
   from the Established state to the Mortal state by sending BYE.  Bob
   sends ACK for the 481 response, because the ACK for error responses
   is handled by the transaction layer and at the point of receiving the
   481 the INVITE client transaction still remains (even though the
   dialog has been terminated).

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Established message, 200 to re-INVITE, in the Mortal
   state.  Bob sends a BYE immediately after sending a re-INVITE.  (A
   user is not conscious that refresher sends re-INVITE automatically.
   For example, in the case of a telephone application, it is possible
   that a user places a receiver immediately after refresher.)  Bob
   sends ACK for a 200 response to INVITE in the Mortal state, so that
   he completes the INVITE transaction.

   Note: As noted in Section 3.1.4, there is a hint for implementation
   to avoid the race conditions of this type.  That is for the UAC to
   delay sending BYE F6 until re-INVITE F5 transaction completes.
   Implementors can decouple the actions of the user (e.g. hanging up)
   from the actions of the protocol (the sending of BYE F6), so that the
   UA can behave as such.  In this case, it is dependent on the
   implementor's choice as to how long it waits.  In most cases, such
   implementation may be useful to prevent a type of race condition
   shown in this section.

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Established message, ACK to 200, in the Mortal state.
   Alice sends an ACK and Bob sends a BYE at the same time.  When the
   offer is in a 2xx, and the answer is in an ACK, this example is in a
   race condition.  The session is not started by receiving the ACK
   because Bob has already terminated the session by sending the BYE.
   The answer in the ACK request is just ignored.

   Note: As noted in Section 3.1.4, there is a hint for implementation
   to avoid the race conditions of this type.  Implementors can decouple
   the actions of the user (e.g. hanging up) from the actions of the
   protocol (the sending of BYE F5), so that the UA can behave as such.
   In this case, it is dependent on the implementor's choice as to how
   long it waits.  In most cases, such implementation may be useful to
   prevent a type of race condition shown in this section.

3.3.  Other race conditions

   This section shows the examples in race condition that are not
   directly related to the dialog state transition.  In SIP, processing
   functions are deployed in three layers, dialog, session, and
   transaction.  There are related each other, but have to be treated
   separately.  Section 17 of RFC 3261 [1] details the processing on
   transactions.  This draft has tried so far to clarify the processing
   on dialogs.  This section explains race conditions which are related
   to sessions established by SIP.

   In this scenario, Alice and Bob send re-INVITE at the same time.
   When two re-INVITEs cross in the same dialog, they resend re-INVITEs
   after different interval for each, according to Section 14.1, of RFC
   3261 [1].  When Alice sends the re-INVITE and it crosses, the re-
   INVITE will be sent again after 2.1-4.0 seconds because she owns the
   Call-ID (she generated it).  Bob will send an INVITE again after
   0.0-2.0 seconds, because Bob isn't the owner of the Call-ID.
   Therefore, each user agent must remember whether it has generated the
   Call-ID of the dialog or not, in case an INVITE may cross with
   another INVITE.

   In this example, Alice's re-INVITE is for session modification and

   Bob's re-INVITE is for session refresh.  In this case, after the 491
   responses, Bob retransmits the re-INVITE for session refresh earlier
   than Alice.  If Alice was to retransmit her re-INVITE (that is, if
   she was not the owner of Call-ID), the request would refresh and
   modify the session at the same time.  Then Bob would know that he
   would not need to retransmit his re-INVITE to refresh the session.

   In another instance where two re-INVITEs for session modification,
   cross over, retransmitting the same re-INVITE again after 491 by the
   Call-ID owner (the UA which retransmits its re-INVITE after the other
   UA) may result in a behavior different from what the user originally
   intended to, so the UA needs to decide if the retransmission of the
   re-INVITE is necessary.  (For example, when a call hold and an
   addition of video media cross over, mere retransmission of the re-
   INVITE at the firing of the timer may result in the situation where
   the video is transmitted immediately after the holding of the audio.
   This behavior is probably not intended by the users.)

   In this scenario, the UPDATE contains an SDP offer, therefore the
   UPDATE and re-INVITE are responded with 491 as in the case of "re-
   INVITE crossover".  When an UPDATE for refresher which doesn't
   contain a session description and a re-INVITE crossed each other,
   both requests succeed with 200 (491 means that UA have a pending
   request).  Moreover, the same is equally true for UPDATE crossover.
   In the former case where either UPDATE contains a session description
   the requests fail with 491, and in the latter cases succeed with 200.

   Note:
      A 491 response is sent because SDP offer is pending, and 491 is an
      error which is related to matters that behave on the session
      established by SIP.

   This scenario illustrates the race condition which occurs when UAS
   receives an Established message, REFER, in the Mortal state.  Bob
   sends a REFER, and Alice sends a BYE at the same time.  Bob sends the
   REFER in the same dialog.  Alice's dialog state moves to the Mortal
   state at the point of sending BYE.  In the Mortal state, UA possesses
   dialog information for internal process but dialog shouldn't exist
   outwardly.  Therefore, UA sends an error response to a REFER which is
   transmitted as a mid-dialog request.  So, Alice in the Mortal state
   sends an error response to the REFER.  However, Bob has already

   Care is advised in sending BYE in the Early state when forking by a
   proxy is expected.  In this example, the BYE request progresses
   normally, and it succeeds in correctly terminating the dialog with
   Bob. After Bob terminates the dialog by receiving the BYE, he sends
   487 to the ini-INVITE.  According to Section 15.1.2 of RFC 3261 [1],
   it is RECOMMENDED for UAS to generate 487 to any pending requests
   after receiving BYE.  In the example, Bob sends 487 to ini-INVITE
   since he receives BYE while the ini-INVITE is in pending state.

   However, Alice receives a final response to INVITE (a 200 from Carol)
   even though she has successfully terminated the dialog with Bob. This
   means that, regardless of the success/failure of the BYE in the Early
   state, Alice MUST be prepared for the establishment of a new dialog
   until receiving the final response for the INVITE and terminating the
   INVITE transaction.

   It is not illegal to send BYE in the Early state to terminate a
   specific early dialog according to the caller's intent.  However, the
   choice of BYE or CANCEL in the Early state must be made carefully.
   CANCEL is appropriate when the goal is to abandon the call attempt
   entirely.  BYE is appropriate when the goal is to abandon a
   particular early dialog while allowing the call to be completed with
   other destinations.  When using either BYE or CANCEL the UAC must be
   prepared for the possibility that a call may still be established to
   one (or more) destinations.

   This case could look similar to the one in Section 3.2.3.  However,
   it is not a race condition.  This case describes the behavior where
   there is no response for INVITE for some reasons.  The appendix
   explains the behavior in such case and its rationale behind, since
   this case is likely to cause confusion.

   First of all, it is important not to confuse the behavior of the
   transaction layer and that of the dialog layer.  RFC 3261 [1] details
   the transaction layer behavior.  The dialog layer behavior is
   explained in this document.  It has to be noted that these behaviors
   are independent of each other, even though the both layers change
   their states triggered by sending or receiving of the same SIP
   messages (A dialog can be terminated even though a transaction still

   remain, and vice versa).

   In the sequence above, there is no response for F1, and F2 (BYE) is
   sent immediately after F1 (F1 is a mid-dialog request.  If F1 was
   ini-INVITE, BYE could not be sent before UAC received a provisional
   response to the request with To tag).

   Below is a figure which illustrates UAC's dialog state and
   transaction state.

   For UAC, the INVITE client transaction begins at the point F1 is
   sent.  The UAC sends BYE (F2) immediately after F1.  This is a
   legitimate behavior.  (Usually the usage of each SIP method is
   independent, for BYE and others.  However, it should be noted that it
   is prohibited to send a request with an SDP offer while the previous
   offer is in progress.)

   After that, F2 triggers the BYE client transaction.  At the same
   time, the dialog state transits to the Mortal state and then only a
   BYE or its response can be handled.

   It is permitted to send F4 (a retransmission of INVITE) in the Mortal
   state, because the retransmission of F1 is handled by the transaction
   layer, and the INVITE transaction has not yet transited to the
   Terminated state.  As it is mentioned above, the dialog and the
   transaction behave independently each other.  Therefore the
   transaction handling has to be continued even though the dialog moved

   to the Terminated state.

   Next, UAS's state is shown below.

   For UAS, it can be regarded that F1 packet is lost or delayed (Here
   the behavior is explained for the case UAS receives F2 BYE before F1
   INVITE).  Therefore, F2 triggers the BYE transaction for UAS, and
   simultaneously the dialog moves to the Mortal state.  Then, upon the
   reception of F4 the INVITE server transaction begins.  (It is allowed
   to start the INVITE server transaction in the Mortal state.  The
   INVITE server transaction begins to handle received SIP request
   regardless of the dialog state.)  UAS's TU sends an appropriate error
   response for F4 INVITE, either 481 (because the TU knows that the
   dialog which matches to the INVITE is in the Terminated state) or 500
   (because the re-sent F4 has an out-of-order CSeq).  (It is mentioned
   above that F4 (and F1) INVITE is a mid-dialog request.  Mid-dialog
   requests have a To tag.  It should be noted that UAS's TU does not
   begin a new dialog upon the reception of INVITE with a To tag.)


Appendix C.  UA's behavior for CANCEL

   This section explains the CANCEL behaviors which indirectly involve
   in the dialog state transition in the Early state.  CANCEL does not
   have any influence on UAC's dialog state.  However, the request has
   indirect influence on the dialog state transition because it has a
   significant effect on ini-INVITE.  For UAS the CANCEL request has
   more direct effects on the dialog than the sending of CANCEL by UAC,

   because they can be a trigger to send the 487 response.  Figure 3
   explains UAS's behavior in the Early state.  This flow diagram is
   only an explanatory figure, and the actual dialog state transition is
   as illustrated in Figure 1 and 2.

   In the flow, full lines are related to dialog state transition, and
   dotted lines are involved with CANCEL. (r) represents the reception
   of signaling, and (s) means sending.  There is no dialog state for
   CANCEL, but here the Cancelled state is virtually handled just for
   the ease of understanding of the UA's behavior when it sends and
   receives CANCEL.

   Below, UAS's flow is explained.

                   Figure 3. CANCEL flow diagram for UAS

   There are two behaviors for UAS depending on the state when it
   receives CANCEL.

   One is when UAS receives CANCEL in the Early states.  In this case



Hasebe, et al.          Expires February 11, 2008              [Page 54]

Internet-Draft    Examples call flow in race condition       August 2007


   the UAS immediately sends 487 for the INVITE, and the dialog transits
   to the Terminated state.

   The other is the case in which UAS receives CANCEL in the Confirmed
   state.  In this case the dialog state transition does not occur
   because UAS has already sent a final response to the INVITE to which
   the CANCEL is targeted.  (Note that, because of UAC's behavior, a UAS
   that receives a CANCEL in the Confirmed state can expect to receive a
   BYE immediately and move to the Terminated state.  However, the UAS's
   state does not transit until it actually receives BYE.)


Appendix D.  Notes on the request in Mortal state

   This section describes UA's behavior in the Mortal state which needs
   careful attention.  Note that every transaction completes independent
   of others, following the principle of RFC 3261 [1].

   In the Mortal state, BYE can be accepted, and the other messages in
   the INVITE dialog usage are responded with an error.  However,
   sending of ACK and the authentication procedure for BYE are conducted
   in this state.  (The handling of messages concerning multiple dialog
   usages is out of the scope of this document.  Refer to I-D.ietf-
   sipping-dialogusage [6] for further information.)

   ACK for error responses is handled by the transaction layer, so the
   handling is not related to the dialog state.  Unlike the ACK for
   error responses, ACK for 2xx responses is a request newly generated
   by TU.  However, the ACK for 2xx and the ACK for error responses are
   both a part of the INVITE transaction, even though their handling
   differs (Section 17.1.1.1, RFC 3261 [1]).  Therefore, the INVITE
   transaction is completed by the three-way handshake, which includes
   ACK, even in the Mortal state.

   Considering actual implementation, UA needs to keep the INVITE dialog
   usage until the Mortal state finishes, so that it is able to send ACK
   for a 2xx response in the Mortal state.  If a 2xx to INVITE is
   received in the Mortal state, the duration of the INVITE dialog usage
   will be extended to 64*T1 seconds after the receiving of the 2xx, to
   cope with the possible 2xx retransmission.  (The duration of the 2xx
   retransmission is 64*T1, so the UA need to be prepared to handle the
   retransmission for this duration.)  However, the UA shall send error
   response to other requests, since the INVITE dialog usage in the
   Mortal state is kept only for the sending of ACK for 2xx.

   BYE authentication procedure shall be processed in the Mortal state.
   When authentication is requested by 401 or 407 response, UAC resends
   BYE with appropriate credentials.  Also UAS handles the

Internet-Draft    Examples call flow in race condition       August 2007


   retransmission of the BYE which it requested authentication itself.


Appendix E.  Forking and receiving new To tags

   This section details the behavior of TU when it receives multiple
   responses with a different To tag to ini-INVITE.

   When an INVITE is forked inside a SIP network, there is a possibility
   that the TU receives multiple responses with a different To tag to
   ini-INVITE (See Section 12.1, 13.1, 13.2.2.4, 16.7, 19.3, etc. of RFC
   3261 [1]).  If the TU receives multiple 1xx responses with a
   different To tag, the original DSM forks and a new DSM instance is
   created.  As a consequence multiple early dialogs are generated.

   If one of the multiple early dialogs receives a 2xx response, it
   naturally transits to the Confirmed state.  No DSM state transition
   occurs for the other early dialogs, and their sessions (early media)
   terminate.  The TU of the UAC terminates the INVITE transaction after
   64*T1 seconds starting at the point of receiving the first 2xx
   response.  Moreover, all mortal early dialogs which do not transit to
   the Established state are terminated (See Section 13.2.2.4 of RFC
   3261 [1]).  By "mortal early dialog" we mean any early dialog that
   the UA will terminate when another early dialog is confirmed.

   Below is an example sequence in which two 180 responses with a
   different To tag are received, and then a 200 response for one of the
   early dialogs (dialog A) is received.  Dotted lines (..) in sequences
   are auxiliary lines to represent the influence on dialog B.

         Figure 4. Receiving 1xx responses with different To tags

   The figure above shows the DSM inside a SIP TU.  Triggered by the
   reception of a provisional response with a different To tag (F4
   180(To tag=B)), DSM forks and the early dialog B is generated.  After
   64*T1 seconds after the dialog A receives 200 OK response, the dialog
   B, which does not transit to the Established state, terminates.

   Next, the behavior of a TU which receives multiple 2xx responses with
   a different To tag is explained.  When a mortal early dialog, which
   did not match the first 2xx response the TU received, receives
   another 2xx response which matches its To tag before 64*T1 INVITE
   transaction timeout, its DSM state transits to the Confirmed state.
   However, the session on the mortal early dialog is terminated when
   the TU receives the first 2xx to establish a dialog, so no session is
   established for the mortal early dialog.  Therefore, when the mortal
   early dialog receives a 2xx response, the TU send an ACK and,
   immediately after, the TU usually sends a BYE to terminate DSM.  (In
   special cases, e.g. a UA intends to establish multiple dialogs, the
   TU may not send the BYE.)

   The handling of the second early dialog after receiving the 200 for

   the first dialog is quite appropriate for a typical device, such as a
   phone.  It is important to note that what is being shown is a
   typically useful action and not the only valid one.  Some devices
   might want to handle things differently.  For instance, a conference
   focus that has sent out an INVITE that forks may want to accept and
   mix all the dialogs it gets.  In that case, no early dialog is
   treated as mortal.

   Below is an example sequence in which two 180 responses with a
   different To tag are received and then a 200 response for each of the
   early dialogs is received.

     Figure 5. Receiving 1xx and 2xx responses with different To tags

   Below is an example sequence when a TU receives multiple 200
   responses with a different To tag before 64*T1 timeout of the INVITE
   transaction in the absence of a provisional response.  Even though a
   TU does not receive provisional response, the TU needs to process the

   2xx responses (See Section 13.2.2.4 of RFC 3261 [1]).  In that case,
   the DSM state is forked at the Confirmed state, and then the TU sends
   an ACK for the 2xx response and, immediately after, the TU usually
   sends a BYE.  (In special cases, e.g. a UA intends to establish
   multiple dialogs, the TU may not send the BYE.)

         Figure 6. Receiving 2xx responses with different To tags

   Below is an example sequence in which the option tag 100rel (RFC 3262
   [5]) is required by a 180.

   If a forking proxy supports 100rel, it transparently transmits to the
   UAC a provisional response which contains a Require header with the
   value of 100rel.  Upon receiving a provisional response with 100rel,
   the UAC establishes the early dialog (B) and sends PRACK.  (Here,
   also, every transaction completes independent of others.)

   As Figure. 4, the early dialog (B) terminates at the same time the
   INVITE transaction terminates.  In the case where a proxy does not

   support 100rel, the provisional response will be handled in the usual
   way (a provisional response with 100rel is discarded by the proxy,
   not to be transmitted to the UAC).
