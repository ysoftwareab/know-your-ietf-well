Abstract

   Path MTU Discovery between hosts/VM/servers/end-points connected over
   a Data-Center/Service-Provider Overlay Network, is still an
   unattended problem.  It needs a converged solution to ensure optimal
   usage of network and computational resources for all hooked end-point
   devices.

1.  Introduction

   There is an operational disconnect between underlay network
   provisioned as the core network, and the overlay network which
   intends to connect islands of customer deployments.  The deployments
   can range from cloud based services to storage applications or
   web(over the top) servers hosted over virtual machines or any other
   end devices like blade servers.  Overlay network are provisioned as
   tunnels leveraging Vxlan (and associated ones like gpe, geneve, gue),
   NVGRE, MPLS and other overlay encapsulations.

   The end hosts in a typical datacenter deployment are connected to
   devices termed as ToR (top of rack devices).  These are the
   networking devices which encapsulate the packet in an Overlay
   construct and relays it over Data center core network.  Although a
   ToR device MAY NOT always be a gateway for an overlay.

   IPv6/IPv4 enabled hosts/end-points, triggering PMTUD, may not get the
   right (or any) information from (over) the core network.  This
   document validates the solution for Vxlan core network (overlay) in a
   data center deployment.  This solution is equally applicable to any
   other tunnel specific core network deployments.

   The proposal in this document, formulates an integrated approach
   which falls inline with OAM modelling discussed in NVO3./>.

2.  Requirements

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When used in lowercase, these words convey their typical use in
   common language, and they are not to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.2.  Solution Requirements

   This section describes the advantages of the proposed solution,
   considering deployment in a typical data center core network:

   (a)  Optimal use of bandwidth in core and client side network of
        typical data center deployment.

   (b)  In case Vxlan Gateway nodes complies to this solution, it MAY
        avoid black holing.

   (c)  All end host applications (like web servers) can tailor the MSS
        accordingly against their respective transports.

   (d)  Facilitates seamless integration of IPv6 or dual stack
        applications over IPv4 based overlays and vice versa.

   (e)  The proposed solution is applicable to all encapsulations
        [RFC7348], [I-D.draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe],
        [I-D.draft-ietf-nvo3-gue], [I-D.draft-gross-geneve] and
        [RFC7637].  Although the problem and solution refers to VXLAN
        [RFC7348] as a use-case in this document.

3.  Problem Description

   In current vendor implementation(s) of Vxlan-Gateway/ToR-device or
   other network devices, which form part of core data center network
   and is configured with an overlay(tunnel) mechanism to transport
   packets from one customer end point to another, are incapable of
   relaying the errors encountered in routing/switching path in their
   networks (underlay network) to the customer end points (hosts/vm/
   blade-servers).  This deems right, as core-network should be
   transparent and water-tight with respect to leaking any public (core)

   network information to customer devices (and vice versa), thus
   ensuring seclusion between different customers provisioning tunneled
   over the same core network.

   For example, the information carried in the IP header of a Vxlan
   encapsulated packet is transparent to the payload (end-point
   generated packet).  Hence, any network-specific information related
   to IPv6/IPv4 native functionality is carried to the end-point
   devices, as is the case with an end-to-end private network.  The
   information generated in the core network devices while processing
   packets destined-to/sourced-from end-point devices, need to be
   percolated from underlay encapsulation to end customer specific
   payload.  This is something which is NOT directed by any standards,
   and also NOT implemented by current deployment(s) of routers and
   switches.

   Considering the fact that future beholds IPv6-only datacenter
   deployments, IPv6 PMTUD is one of the major casualties which can
   linger on forever, in case not dealt with as of now.  Although this
   document intends to resolve PMTUD problem as a generic one across all
   underlay encapsulations.

   Note that terms "ICMP(V6)" or "icmp(v4)" are used in the document
   with an intention to refer to both icmp and icmpv6, in case same
   context applies to both.

3.1.  IPv6 PMTUD Issues

   As mentioned in the [RFC1981], IPV6 PMTUD is based on the "Packet too
   big" icmpv6 error code, generated by the networking device which is
   capable of generating such messages on encountering packet paths
   which go over link with MTU size smaller than packet size.

   There are problems getting this working when end-point device
   initiates a "Path MTU Discovery" to remote end-point device.  It may
   lead to black-holing as per the current implementations.

   The following bullets provides pointers to potential black holing of
   PMTUD packets,

   (1)  Vxlan Gateway(or ToR) MAY not set the DF bit in the outer IP
        header encapsulation.

   (2)  Vxlan Gateway(or TOR) is incapable of relaying icmp error
        "Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set", generated by
        IPv4 enabled core network device (underlay network), to IPv6
        enabled end-point host/vm/server(source of the original packet).

   The problems are discussed in detail in the following sub-sections.

3.1.1.  Inaccurate MTU relayed to end hosts

   ToR devices are christened as VtepA and VtepB, reachabile over an

   Link mtu between VtepA, R1 and VtepB is 1300 bytes, where as for the
   link between H1 and VtepA, H2 and VtepB, is 1500 bytes.

   H1 sends out a packet obliging to 1500 bytes MTU packet size
   containment over the H1 and VtepA link.  VtepA encapsulates the
   packet with (Vxlan + UDP) header and outer IP header corresponding to
   underlay reachability to destination tunnel end-point, that is VtepB,
   to reach out to H2.

   header + Vxlan header + Original L2 Packet from H1 containing the
   IPv6 Payload) SHOULD be fragmented.  In case Vxlan gateway, VtepA,
   does not sets the DF-bit in the outer IP header, the packet gets
   fragmented, with the reassembly done at the egress gateway (VtepB).

   The re-assembled packet is routed by VtepB to H2.  This can
   potentially lead to inaccurate Path MTU calculation at H1.  H1
   assumes it to be 1500 bytes as no icmp error is received.  This opens
   the door for fragment/reassembly and more cpu cycles on networking
   devices in core network.

3.1.2.  Packet_Too_Big not-relayed to host

   In figure 1, assume that link between VtepA and R1 is 1500 as the
   only change from the figure 1 topology.  Hence the packet send by H1,
   leads to VtepA setting the DF-bit in the outer IP header(as part of
   Vxlan Encapsulation).  When R1 receives the packet and the routing
   table lookup points to the outgoing link with mtu size R1_VtepB_MTU
   bytes, less than the packet size (1500 bytes).  As DF-bit is set, R1
   generates ICMPv4 error directed towards the src-ip (VtepA_IPv4).  It
   encapsulates the inner PDU of the original packet.  However, VtepA
   drops the icmp error packet and fails to relay it to H1.  This leads
   to black-holing.

   The above two sub-sections lay down potential problems for IPv6 Path
   MTU Discovery mechanism in an Overlay network.  Although these
   problem are generic to any combination of underlay and overlay
   network types (IPv4 or IPv6), the use-case topology in this document
   is specific to IPv6 end-point devices connected over Vxlan network,
   wherein, the underlay is connected over IPv4 network, unless
   mentioned specifically.

4.  Solution(s)

4.1.  Discovery of end-to-end Path MTU

   Since Vxlan Gateway (can be a ToR device) is the one, which
   encapsulates the Vxlan (or any other overlay) header onto the packet
   traversing through the overlay network and also decapsulates the
   overlay header for packets egressing out of same and heading towards
   the end devices, the solution becomes more apt to be installed on
   devices playing such role.

   Firstly, It is a MUST that Vxlan gateways (VtepA, VtepB or ToR
   device) SHOULD set the DF-bit in Outer header encapsulation for
   client packets that are wrapped with vxlan, related encapsulation,
   for Path MTU Discovery.  Thus ensuring that ICMP error packet is
   generated for packet size exceeding the link MTU in underlay network.

Internet-Draft              PMTUD Over Vxlan                   June 2017


   Secondly, it is MUST that Vxlan gateway devices translates the ICMP
   error "Destination Unreachable" with code 'Fragmentation Needed and
   Don't Fragment was Set', into a ICMPv6 error 'Packet too big' packet.
   This mandates that original packet carried in the icmp error message
   MUST carry information about the inner payload(original packet), and
   it is an IPv6 Packet, originated from the end-point device (H1 for
   VtepA in figure 1), connected to the Vxlan gateway over L3/L2
   network.

   Thirdly, it is MUST that Vxlan gateway devices translates the ICMPv6
   error 'Packet too big' into a ICMP error 'Destination Unreachable'
   with code 'Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set' packet.
   Successfully translation mandates that, original packet carried in
   the icmp error message gives information about the inner payload
   (original packet), and it is an IPv4 packet, which originated from
   the end-point device connected to gateway over L3/L2 network.

   Fourthly, incase both, the client side network connected to Vxlan
   Gateway and the underlay network are same, that is, either both are
   ipv4 or both are ipv6, then icmp error code error translation is NOT
   required.  Rest of the process to retrieve original packet is
   identical.

4.1.1.  ICMP extensions, PMTUD on Vxlan

   This solution leverages extensions in ICMP and ICMPv6 standards,
   [RFC4884], for the maximum size of the original packet that can be
   encapsulated in ICMP error message with code as "Fragmentation
   Required(icmp)" or "Packet too big(icmpv6)" respectively.  As the
   host info is encapsulated in the inner payload, this requires
   additional bytes of data in icmp packet: (Outer IP Header + UDP
   Header + Vxlan + Inner L2 Header + Inner IPv6 SRC/DST IPs).

   In case Vxlan core network is provisioned over IPv6 underlay, then
   similar extensions are applicable to icmpv6.

   The processing of ICMP(V6) packet is extended from the current
   standards of 'non-delivery of ICMP(v6) packets to upper-layers on
   Vxlan gateways' to 'relaying it to the end-point devices'.

4.1.2.  Packet Path Processing

   Packet Path handling and processing is explained in this section.
   The assumptions are made with respect to network topology mentioned
   in Section 3.1.1.  The packet format in each flow captures packet
   fields which are significant with respect to this solution.  To
   understand the solution, the packet flow is explained which leads to

4.1.2.1.  Packet Processing at Vxlan Gateway

   Processing at VtepA, in packet path from H1 to H2.

   (1)  VtepA(Vxlan gateway) performs the Vxlan encapsulation over the
        packet received from H1, based on route lookup.  The detail for
        encap are mentioned in [RFC7348].

   (2)  VtepA MUST set the DF-bit in the Outer IP header.

   (3)  Since the MTU of outgoing link is more than the packet, packet
        is sent out towards the underlay next hop, R1.

   (4)  P3 packets encapsulation is shown in figure 3.  P3 may find a
        reference without outer header encapsulation [RFC7348] provides
        details of the vxlan encapsulation.

4.1.2.2.  Underlay Generates ICMP error

   In case the underlay is ipv6 and not ipv4, icmpv6 error is generated.

   Processing at R1:

   (1)  Packet Size (1500 bytes) is more than the outgoing link's mtu
        (1300 bytes) and DF-bit is set in the Outer IPv4 header added as
        part of Vxlan encapsulation at VtepA.

   (2)  R1 MUST generate icmp error message (Destination Unreachable)
        with error code (Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was
        Set).  For ease of solution description, mtu is assumed to be
        symmetric over the reverse path, hence reverse path mtu from R1
        to VtepA is 1500 bytes.  ICMP(v6) error message MUST include MTU
        of link between R1 and VtepB.

   (3)  In a nut shell, the ICMP PDU encapsulation SHOULD be performed
        as mentioned in [RFC4884] , [RFC4443].  These standards atleast
        ensure, that original packet carried in icmp error PDU captures
        enough bytes to include the inner packets IPv6 header atleast.
        The capture of application specific details depends on the size
        of the Optional header in the original packet (generated by H1
        as in Figure 2b) and subsequent transport header.  This helps
        Vxlan Gateway to trace(L3 reachability) the original packet
        generator (end-point device) atleast and translate icmp error
        generted by underlay into icmpv6 one and relay it to end-point
        device.  The length field in ICMP PDU, include the maximum
        possible length permissible in reverse path MTU

   For simplicity, not including the original packet header in the flow
   diagram in figure 4.  ICMP PDU details are depicted in the follow up
   figure 5.

4.1.2.3.  Relay ICMP(v6) Error to End Devices

   This sub-section can also be generalized as: "handling of icmp
   errors, which are generated by underlay network in response to end-
   device packets, by Vxlan Gateway".

   Processing at VtepA: Processing of icmp error message with code
   (Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set):

   (1)  The icmp error is processed by Vxlan gateways as per the
        standards defined in [RFC1981] , [RFC4884] and [RFC4443] .

   (2)  If error code is (Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was
        Set), it SHOULD perform further inspection of the original
        packet, P3(ethernet payload without its header) carried as data
        in ICMP PDU in extension to standards referred in previous
        bullet.  The extension processing MUST be done prior to taking a
        decision to either drop the packet or deliver to upper-layer
        protocols.

   (3)  In extension to above, Vxlan gateway device SHOULD perform the
        vxlan decap as defined in [RFC7348], to arrive at the inner
        packet (P2, original packet with VtepA rewrite).  The underlay
        encap is not carrying the layer-2 header in the icmp error
        packet.  Once this processing is done, P2 is the packet which
        needs attention now, as it carries the credentials of actual
        host which should receive the relayed icmp packet.

   (4)  The layer-3 payload type SHOULD be verified using ethernet type
        field in ethernet header.  In case it point to IPv6, src-ipv6
        field should be picked up to check for reahability, as the icmp
        packet MUST be sent to original sender, that is, H1.  In case H1

        is reachable, ICMP packet SHOULD be constructed as mentioned in
        the following bullet.

   (5)  Now that P2 is out in the open, it's L2 header is decapsulated,
        and the leftover, in the figure 6, is run through the icmpv6
        processing as mentioned in [RFC4443].

   (6)  It SHOULD generate ICMPv6 error message with type (Packet too
        big) destined to H1_IPv6, that is inner ipv6 packet's source
        ipv6 address.  The mtu 'R1_VtepB_MTU' is copied from icmp error
        packet recieved from the underlay.

   (7)  The IPv6 header is constructed from original payload as shown in
        figure 5.  The source ipv6 address is picked as local ipv6
        address "VtepA_IPv6".  The destination ipv6 address is set as
        the "src-ipv6" in original payload, H1_IPv6.  The Next Header is
        set as "58" which denote ICMPv6.  The derivation of ethernet
        header is based on next hop to mac address mapping as is
        performed in any L3 lookup.  The follow up figure 9, shows the
        icmpv6 error packet sent out to node H1.  H1 is the original
        IPv6 packet generator as mentioned in Figure 2b.

   There are few more potential flows worth mentioning in this section.
   These cases are related to, icmp error getting generated from,
   ingress Vxlan gateway (VtepA) and egress Vxlan gateway (VtepB) with
   respect to packet sent from H1 to H2.  For ingress Vxlan gateway
   (VtepA) case, the legacy IPv6 PMTUD rules from [RFC4443] SHOULD be
   applied as no Vxlan encap is involved.

   Where as, egress Vxlan gateway (VtepB) SHOULD send packet P3 (without
   L2 header) in the icmp data, even though mtu calculation MAY be done
   post vxlan decapsulation.  That is when the outgoing link is
   identified as the one from VtepB to H2.  It MAY buffer packet P3
   prior to lookup based on inner packet (P2) credentials, so that P3
   can be encapsulated in the icmp packet.  This also ensures the packet
   format consistency, when accessed at the VtepA for translation before
   relaying it to H1.

4.1.3.  ICMP(v6) Error Translation

   This section specifically mentions about ICMP and ICMPv6 packet
   translation, generated in an underlay network to the one which is,
   understood by the end point device, with encapsulation aligning with
   the network-type(IPv4 and IPv6), end-point device and underlay is
   provisioned with.  The last leg processing mentioned in previous sub-
   section is specific to the topology mentioned in Section 3.1.1.
   However, this subsection elaborates on all possible topology
   combination of underlay and end-device networks with respect to IPv4
   or IPv6.  The explanation provided in form of figures for error
   generated by underlay and the translated one relayed to the end-point
   device by Vxlan gateway.

   (a)  End-Point is IPv6 connected and Underlay is IPv4 provisioned.

   (b)  End-Point is IPv4 connected and Underlay is IPv6 provisioned.

   (c)  Both End-Point and Underlay are provisioned with IPv6.

   (d)  Both End-Point and Underlay are provisioned with IPv4.

4.1.3.1.  End-Point is IPv6 connected and Underlay is IPv4 provisioned

   This case is similar to the last leg processing described in
   Section 4.1.2 and does not needs any more description.

4.1.3.2.  End-Point is IPv4 connected and Underlay is IPv6 provisioned

   Topology drawn in figure 10, provides for the icmpv6 PDU encap
   generated by R1.  H1_IPv4 and H2_IPv4 are in distinct ipv4 subnets.
   R1_IPv6 represents IPv6 addresses falling in both subnets connecting
   to VtepA and VtepB.

   Another difference between an IPv4 and IPv6 underlay is that for IPv6
   underlay there is no concept of DF-bit.  The fragmentation can only
   be done at ingress.  At all other underlay nodes "Packet too big"
   icmpv6 error is generated.  Vxlan Gateway SHOULD ensure that
   fragmentation is avoided at Vxlan Gateway and icmp error is sent back

        Figure 11. ICMPV6 PDU Sent by R1 to VtepA


   R1 sends an icmpv6 error "Packet Too Big" directed towards VtepA.
   The icmpv6 PDU is shown in Figure 11.  VtepA receives the packet with
   this icmpv6 PDU and translates it to icmp PDU with type "Destination
   Unreachable" and code "Fragmentation Needed" before relaying it to H1
   over ipv4 network.  Figure 12, reflects the relayed packet sent by
   VtepA to H1.  All other references SHOULD be taken as it is from
   Section 4.1.2.

Figure 14. ICMPv6 PDU generated by Intermediate Hop, R1 in Vxlan Network


   R1 sends an icmpv6 error "Packet Too Big" directed towards VtepA.
   The icmpv6 PDU is shown in Figure 14.  VtepA receives the packet with
   this icmpv6 PDU and relays it to H1 without any translation as H1 is
   connected to VtepA over ipv6 network.  All other references about
   original packet to be include in the icmpv6 PDU can be taken as it is
   from Section 4.1.2.

   R1 sends an icmp error directed towards VtepA.  The icmp PDU is shown
   in figure 17.  VtepA receives the packet with this icmp PDU and
   relays it to H1 over ipv4 network.  Figure 16, displays the packet
   sent by VtepA to H1.  All other references can be taken as it is from
   Section 4.1.2.

5.  Multicast and Anycast Considerations

   Multicast solution is similar to one proposed in [RFC1981].  This
   SHOULD be applied at Vtep for cases of unknown unicast destinations.

   There are no anycast considerations in this document, as the solution
   is based upon nodes deriving mtu values from the underlay network
   which should either have unicast or multicast reachability between
   them.

6.  Ecmp Considerations

   Ecmp considerations are driven by the packet sent by the end host
   application and the way it's leveraged.

   To ensure PMTUD is agnostic to ecmp paths in a Vxlan network, there
   are few more consideration.  In Vxlan Gateway (can be ToR device),
   the route look-up is done based on attributes carried in packet
   generated by end point host.  The packet generated can potentially be
   from a tcp based end host application (although should not be
   generalized).

   Where as, for an intermediate node, (lets say, Spine node in Clos
   topology) in core network the look ups are based on Outer Encap (Vtep
   ip addresses and and UDP Header).

   On another note, for an L2 gateway case, wherein Vxlan gateway (Vtep
   Node) bridges (and not routes) host packets destined to same subnet
   destination, MTU calculation SHOULD come into play only in the Spine
   devices.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits all the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC1981] and [RFC1191].

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

9.  Acknowledgements

   Rohit Mendiratta for providing the inputs.
