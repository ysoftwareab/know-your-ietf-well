Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Control Framework [SIPCF] provides a generic approach for
   establishment and reporting capabilities of remotely initiated
   commands.  The Framework utilizes many functions provided by the
   Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261] (SIP) for the rendezvous and
   establishment of a reliable channel for control interactions.  The
   Control Framework also introduces the concept of a Control Package.
   A Control Package is an explicit usage of the Control Framework for a
   particular interaction set.  This specification defines a package for
   basic IVR.

   The scope of the package is control of media server functions for
   basic interactive media (e.g. play a prompt, collecting DTMF,
   recording user input) as well as notifications related to these
   functions.

   These functions and notifications are defined as messages in XML
   [XML].  The message use XML elements for preparing, starting and
   stopping dialogs, as well as elements for responses and notifications
   ([CCXML10], [MSML] and [MSCP]).

   This basic IVR package uses template dialogs to provide IVR
   functionality.  Three template dialogs are defined:

   playannouncement:  a dialog to play one or more prompts to the user

   promptandcollect:  a dialog to prompt the user and collect their
      input

   promptandrecord:  a dialog to prompt the user and record their input

   Template dialogs are intended to provide basic IVR functionality
   ([H.248.9], [RFC4240], [MSML], [RFC2897] and [MSCML]).  The template
   approach follows previous approaches in that it provides IVR
   functionality which is commonly required for applications.  It
   differs in that the functionality is expressed in XML using a
   reference to the template dialog, and parameters expressed in a
   simple XML data structure.  This is a lightweight approach since the
   contents of the dialog itself does not need to be transported over
   the control channel (or fetched from an external source), only a
   template reference plus configuration data is required.  From the
   developer's perspective, this simplifies application development:
   they do not need to write their IVR dialog using custom XML elements,
   they only need to reference the template dialog and, if required,
   populate a simple XML data structure to pass configuration data.

   To use a template dialog, the AS developer references it by name in

   an XML message for preparing or starting a dialog; for example
   <dialogstart src="promptandrecord"/>.  The XML message may also
   contain template input parameters in a <data> element to configure
   specific behavior defined by the template dialog; e.g. using
   "prompts" with the value "http://www.example.com/welcome.wav".  If
   the dialog starts successfully, a <response status="200"/> is
   returned.  When the dialog is completed, the MS returns template
   output parameters in a dialogexit <event> notification to the AS.

   The implementation of template dialogs requires only that they adhere
   to the syntax and semantics of templates described in this document.

   Other control packages MAY be defined which extend the capabilities
   of the templates dialogs defined in this document.  Such control
   packages MUST respect the syntax and semantics of this control
   package.

   This document specifies how the basic IVR control package fulfils the
   requirements of the SIP Control Framework control packages
   (Section 3), which XML elements are defined by the package
   (Section 4), the template dialog definitions (Section 5) as well as
   providing examples (Section 6, Section 7) and an XML schema
   (Section 8).

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".  In addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   The following additional terms are defined for use in this document:

   Dialog:  A dialog performs media interaction with a user.  A dialog
      is identified by a URI and has an associated mimetype.  Dialogs
      typically feature basic capabilities such as playing audio
      prompts, collecting DTMF input and recording audio input from the
      user.  More advanced dialogs may also feature synthesized speech,
      recording and playback of video, recognition of spoken input, and
      mixed initiative conversations.

   Application server:  A SIP [RFC3261] application server (AS) hosts
      and executes services such as interactive media and conferencing
      in an operator's network.  An AS influences and impacts the SIP
      session, in particular by terminating SIP sessions on a media
      server, which is under its control.

   Media Server:  A media server (MS) processes media streams on behalf
      of an AS by offering functionality such as interactive media,
      conferencing, and transcoding to the end user.  Interactive media
      functionality is realized by way of dialogs, which are identified
      by a URI and initiated by the application server.

3.  Control Package Definition

   This section fulfills the mandatory requirement for information that
   MUST be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
   Package, as detailed in Section 9 of [SIPCF].

3.1.  Control Package Name

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify and register a unique name and version.

   The name and version of this Control Package is "msc-ivr-basic/1.0"
   (Media Server Control - Interactive Voice Response - Basic - version
   1.0 ).

3.2.  Framework Message Usage

   IVR functionality includes capabilities such as playing prompts,
   collecting DTMF and recording user input.  These functions are
   expressed using template dialogs defined in Section 5.

   This package defines XML elements in Section 4 and provides an XML
   Schema in Section 8.

   The XML elements in this package are split into requests, responses
   and event notifications.  Requests are carried in CONTROL message
   bodies; <dialogprepare>, <dialogstart> and <dialogterminate> elements
   are defined as package requests.  Responses are carried either in
   REPORT message or Control Framework 200 response bodies; the
   <response> element is defined as a package response.  Event
   notifications are also carried in REPORT message bodies; the <event>
   element is defined for package event notifications.

   Note that package responses are different from framework response
   codes.  Framework error response codes (see Section 8 of [SIPCF]) are
   used when the request or event notification is invalid; for example,
   a request is invalid XML (400), or not understood (500).  Package
   responses are carried in 200 response or REPORT message bodies.  This
   package's response codes are defined in Section 4.2.1.

   The schema uses "connection-id" and "conf-id" attributes which are
   imported from schema defined in core Control Framework [SIPCF].

3.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


   This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]
   MUST be supported for media dialogs and conferences.

3.4.  CONTROL Message Body

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the schema defined in
   Section 8 and described in Section 4.  XML messages appearing in
   CONTROL messages MUST contain a <dialogprepare>, <dialogstart> or
   <dialogterminate> request element (Section 4.1).

3.5.  REPORT Message Body

   A valid REPORT body MUST conform to the schema defined in Section 8
   and described in Section 4.  XML messages appearing in REPORT
   messages MUST contain a <response> (Section 4.2), or a (notification)
   <event> element (Section 4.3).

4.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML messages for this control package.

   [Editors Note: since XML Schema may not be able to express all
   constraints expressed in these definitions, in cases where there is a
   difference in constraints, the definitions in the section take
   priority.]

4.1.  Requests

   The following request elements are defined:

   <dialogprepare>:  prepare an IVR dialog for later execution

   <dialogstart>:  start an IVR dialog on a connection or conference

   <dialogterminate>:  terminate an active IVR dialog

4.1.1.  <dialogprepare>

   The <dialogprepare> request is sent from the AS to the MS to request
   preparation of an IVR dialog.  A prepared dialog is executed when the
   AS sends a <dialogstart> request referencing the prepared dialog (see
   Section 4.1.2).

   A <dialogprepare> element has the following attributes:

   src:  string identifying the URI of the dialog document to prepare.
      The attribute is mandatory.  The MS MUST support
      "playannouncement", "promptandcollect" and "promptandrecord"
      template dialogs as the value for this attribute.

   dialogid:  string indicating a unique name for the dialog.  If this
      attribute is not specified, the MS creates a unique name for the
      dialog.  The value is used in subsequent references to the dialog
      (e.g. as dialogid in a <response>).  It is an error if a dialog
      with the same name already exists on the MS.  The attribute is
      optional.

   The <dialogprepare> element has the following child elements:

   <data>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.4) to pass parameters
      into the dialog.  It is an error if a specified parameter is not
      supported by the implementation.  The element is optional.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


   <subscribe>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.5) indicating
      notification events to which the AS subscribes.  It is an error if
      a specified notification event is not supported by the
      implementation.  The element is optional.

   For example, a request to prepare a playannouncement dialog where a
   single prompt is played once:

   <dialogprepare src="playannouncement">
     <data>
        <item name="prompts"
                 value="http://www.example.com/prompt1.wav"/>
        <item name="iterations" value="1"/>
     </data>
   </dialogprepare>

   When an MS has successfully received a <dialogprepare> request, it
   MUST reply with a <response> element (Section 4.2).

4.1.2.  <dialogstart>

   The <dialogstart> element is sent by the AS to request execution of a
   dialog.  The dialog may be defined in the dialogstart request itself,
   or reference a previously prepared dialog.

   The <dialogstart> element has the following attributes:

   src:  string identifying the URI of the dialog document to start.
      The attribute is optional.  The MS MUST support playannouncement,
      promptandcollect and promptandrecord template dialogs as the value
      for this attribute.

   dialogid:  string indicating a unique name for the dialog.  If this
      attribute is not specified, the MS creates a unique name for the
      dialog.  The value is used in subsequent references to the dialog
      (e.g. as dialogid in a <response>).  It is an error if a dialog
      with the same name already exists on the MS.  The attribute is
      optional.

   prepareddialogid:  string identifying a dialog previously prepared
      using a dialogprepare request.  The attribute is optional.

   connection-id:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection on which
      this dialog is to be started (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The
      attribute is optional.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


   conf-id:  string identifying the conference on which this dialog is
      to be started (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The attribute is
      optional.

   If the prepareddialogid is specified, it is an error to specify the
   src or dialogid attributes.

   If the prepareddialogid is not specified, exactly the src attribute
   MUST be specified; otherwise, it is an error.

   Exactly one of the connection-id or conf-id attributes MUST be
   specified.  It is an error to specify both connection-id and conf-id.

   The <dialogstart> element has the following child elements defined:

   <stream>:  contains the following attributes:

      media:  a string indicating the type of media associated with the
         stream.  It is strongly recommended that the following values
         are used for common types of media: "audio" for audio media,
         and "video" for video media.  The attribute is mandatory.

      label:  a string indicating the SDP label associated with a media
         stream ([RFC4574]).  The attribute is optional.

      direction:  a string indicating the direction of the media flow
         between a dialog and its end point conference or connection.
         Defined values are: "sendrecv" (media can be sent and
         received), "sendonly" (media can only be sent), and "recvonly"
         (media can only be received).  The default value is "sendrecv".
         The attribute is optional.

      One or more <stream> elements may be specified so that individual
      media streams can be controlled independently; for example, audio
      only for transmission, but video only for reception.  The <stream>
      element is optional.  If no <stream> elements are specified, then
      the default is the media configuration of the connection or
      conference.  It is an error if a <stream> element is in conflict
      with (a) another <stream> element, (b) with dialog, connection or
      conference media capabilities, or (c) with a SDP label value as
      part of the connection-id (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).

   <data>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.4) to pass parameters
      into the dialog.  It is an error if a specified parameter is not
      supported by the implementation.  The element is optional.

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


   <subscribe>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.5) indicating
      notification events to which the AS subscribes.  It is an error if
      a specified notification event is not supported by the
      implementation.The element is optional.

   [Editors Note: the <stream> element assumes that the use of the SDP
   label by itself is insufficent for media stream control.  In
   particular, the SDP label does not address directionality, nor does
   it address conferences.  Further investigation of the <stream> is is
   required.]

   If the prepareddialogid is specified and the <dialogprepare>
   contained a <data> element, it is an error to specify it in
   <dialogstart>.  Likewise, If the prepareddialogid is specified and
   the <dialogprepare> contained a <subscribe> element, it is an error
   to specify it in <dialogstart>.

   For example, a request to start a promptandrecord template dialog on
   a conference:

    <dialogstart conf-id="conference11" src="playandrecord">
       <data>
         <item name="maxtime" value="384000s"/>
       </data>
    </dialogstart>

   When an MS has successfully received a <dialogstart> request, it MUST
   reply with a <response> element (Section 4.2).

4.1.3.  <dialogterminate>

   A dialog that has been successfully prepared or started can be
   terminated by a <dialogterminate> request element from the AS.

   The <dialogterminate> element has the following attributes:

   dialogid:  string identifying an existing dialog.  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   immediate:  string with the values "true" or "false" indicating
      whether the dialog is to be terminated immediately or not.  If a
      dialog is terminated immediately, no further dialog event
      notifications are sent (including a dialogexit <event>).  The
      default is "false".  The attribute is optional.

   For example, assuming a dialog with the dialogid "vxi1" has been
   started, it can be terminated immediately with the following request:

   <dialogterminate dialogid="vxi1" immediate="true"/>

   When an MS has successfully received a <dialogterminate> request, it
   MUST reply with a <response> element (Section 4.2).

4.2.  Responses

   Responses are specified in a <response> element.

4.2.1.  <response>

   Reponses to requests are indicated by a <response> element.

   The <response> element has following attributes:

   status:  numeric code indicating the response status.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

   reason:  string specifying a reason for the response status.  The
      attribute is optional.

   dialogid:  string identifying the dialog.  The attribute is optional.

   connection-id:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection
      associated with the dialog (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The
      attribute is optional.

   conf-id:  string identifying the conference associated with the
      dialog (see Section 16.1 of [SIPCF]).  The attribute is optional.

   The following status codes are defined:

4.3.  Notifications

   Event notifications are specified in an <event> element.

4.3.1.  <event>

   Dialog event notifications are either manual or automatic.

   Manual event notifications are defined when an AS subscribes to
   notifications for dialog events using the <subscribe> element of
   <dialogprepare> or <dialogstart>.

   Automatic event notifications are defined as part of a Control
   Package.  The AS SHOULD NOT subscribe to these event notifications.
   The MS MUST support these event notifications.  This package defines
   one automatic notification event: "dialogexit" which indicates that
   an active dialog has terminated.  Note that this notification is not
   sent if the dialog has been terminated by the AS using a
   <dialogterminate/> request where "immediate=true".

   When a dialog generates a notification event, the MS sends the event
   to the AS using an <event> element.

   The <event> element has the following attributes:

   name:  string indicating the name of dialog event.  The string is
      restricted to a sequence of alphanumeric or "." characters.  The
      attribute is mandatory.

   dialogid:  string identifying the dialog.  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   The <event> element has the following child element:

   <data>:  an XML data structure (see Section 4.4) to pass information
      additional information about the dialog event.  The element is
      optional.

   For example, when a dialog exits the MS may send a dialogexit <event>
   with data indicating the status of a template dialog:

   <event name="dialogexit" dialogid="vxi1">
    <data>
      <item name="status" value="1"/>
    </data>
   </event>

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


4.4.  <data>

   The <data> element is a general container for parameterized data.

   The <data> element has no attributes, but has the following child
   elements defined:

   <item>:  contains the following attributes:

      name:  a string indicating the name of the parameter.  The
         attribute is mandatory.

      value:  a string indicating the value of the parameter.  Multiple
         values of a parameters can be specified using space separation.
         The attribute is mandatory.

   Multiple <item> elements may be specified.

   For example, a <data> specifying promptandcollect template parameters
   with simple values:

   <data>
      <item name="iterations" value="5"/>
      <item name="timeout" value="10s"/>
   </data>

   In this example, a <data> specifying a playannouncement template with
   a complex value for the prompts parameter:

   <data>
    <item name="prompts" value="http://example.com/balance.wav
             http://example.com/five.wav http://example.com/euros.wav"/>
   </data>

   [Editors Note: we may also want to investigate the use of <item>s
   nested within a top-level <item> to specify complex values. ]

4.5.  <subscribe>

   The <subscribe> element is a container for specifying dialog
   notification events to which an AS subscribes.  Notifications of
   dialog events are delivered using the <event> element (see
   Section 4.3.1).

   The <subscribe> element has no attributes, but has the following
   child elements defined:

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


   <notify>:  contains the following attributes:

      name:  a string indicating the name of the event to be notified
         of.  The attribute is mandatory.

      The <notify> element may have a <data> child element.

   Multiple <notify> elements may be specified.

   For example, the AS wishes to subscribe to DTMF and bargein
   notification events associated with a dialog:

   <dialogstart src="promptandcollect"
        connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <subscribe>
       <notify name="dtmf"/>
       <notify name="bargein"/>
     </subscribe>
   </dialogstart>

   If the MS supports these notification events, then it would use the
   <event> element to send notifications during the dialog to the AS
   when the events occured.

   [Editors Note: It may be possible to define a general event
   subscription mechanism as part of the SIP Control Framework.]

   [Editors Note: This Control Package does not specify dialog
   notification events apart from "dialogexit".  Later versions may
   define events such as: "dtmf" (a DTMF key is pressed), "mediastart"
   (media playback started), "bargein" (user has barged in on a prompt),
   and "rtpcontrol" (control data, e.g.  VFU, PoC, etc, is received over
   the RTP control channel.]

5.  IVR Template Dialogs

   The execution of IVR template dialog takes place on the MS.  The AS
   specifies the name of the template and configuration parameters, and
   receives the result from the MS after the dialog has been executed.

   Input parameters are used to configure and customize the behavior of
   the template.  For many input parameters, the templates provide
   default values; a developer can specify an alternative value if the
   default is not appropriate for their application.  Input parameters
   for templates may be mandatory, requiring a specific value to be
   provided.

   The result of executing a template dialog is reported to the AS using
   output parameters.  These parameters may describe status information,
   error information or information collected from the user.  Output
   parameters are mandatory or optional depending on the specific
   template; mandatory parameters must be specified by the
   implementation.

   Template dialogs are invoked by referencing them in the src attribute
   of <dialogprepare> (Section 4.1.1) or <dialogstart> (Section 4.1.2).
   Input parameters are specified in the <data> child element
   (Section 4.4) of these elements.  Output parameters are specified in
   the <data> child element of a dialogexit <event> notification
   (Section 4.3.1).  The detailed mapping of template dialogs to XML
   CONTROL and REPORT messages is described in Section 3 and examples
   are provided in Section 7.

   The implementation of template dialogs MUST adhere to the syntax and
   semantics of templates described in this document.  Implementations
   MAY support additional parameters of the defined template dialogs.
   Implementations MAY support additional template dialogs.  The actual
   implementation may be based on any technology or scripting language.

   The media requirements on the template implementation are restricted
   to the capability to play audio prompts (specified as URIs), collect
   DTMF input, and record audio input.  The implementation MUST support
   G.711 audio formats (headerless and wav) for playback and recording.
   The implementation MAY support other media formats.

   [Editors Note: Later versions may consider additional media
   requirements including TTS, ASR, video, etc. ]

5.1.  Play Announcement

   A template dialog to play announcements to the user.

   The template dialog is invoked using the URI "playannouncement".

   The dialog execution model consists of:

   1.  Playing prompts in the order specified until completion.

   2.  Repeating step 1 for the value of iterations.

   3.  Returning status and reason parameters.

   The input and output parameters are summarized and defined below.

5.2.  Prompt and Collect

   A template dialog to play prompts and collect DTMF input.

   The dialog is invoked with the URI "promptandcollect".

   The dialog execution model consists of:

   1.  Clearing the digit buffer depending on the value of
       cleardigitbuffer.

   2.  Playing prompts in the order specified.  The bargein parameter
       determines whether user input can be collected during prompt
       playback stops (if so, prompt playback is stopped).

   3.  Collecting DTMF input from the user.  Valid DTMF patterns are
       either a simple digit string where the maximum length is
       determined by maxdigits and may be terminated by the character in
       termchar; or a custom DTMF grammar specified by grammar.  The
       parameters timeout, interdigittimeout and termtimeout control
       user input timeout, interdigit timeout and the terminating
       timeout respectively.

   4.  If no input is collected or the input is invalid, steps 1 - 3 are
       repeated for the value of iterations.

   5.  Returning status, reason and result parameters.

   The input and output parameter are summarized and defined below.

5.3.  Prompt and Record

   A template dialog to prompt the user and record their audio input.

   The dialog is invoked with the URI "promptandrecord".

   The dialog execution model consists of:

   1.  Playing prompts in the order specified until completion.

   2.  Recording audio input from the user.  Recording is initiated if
       user input is received before timeout expires.  The recording is
       terminated by DTMF input, the maximum duration being exceeded or
       a final silence after recording, as specified in dtmfterm,
       maxtime and finalsilence parameters respectively.

   3.  If recording is not initiated, steps 1 - 2 are repeated for the
       value of iterations.

   4.  Returning status, reason and result parameters.

   The input and output parameter are summarized and defined below.

   immediately by the AS, allowing the MS to send a dialogexit
   notification <event> with information collected during the dialog.

7.  Template Dialog Examples

   The following examples show how playannouncement, promptandcollect
   and promptandrecord template dialogs are used with <dialogprepare>,
   <dialogstart> and <event> elements.

   The examples do not specify all messages between the AS and MS.

7.1.  playannouncement

   This example prepares an announcement composed of two prompts.


   <dialogprepare src="playannouncement">
       <data>
          <item name="prompts"
                value="http://www.example.com/media/Number_09.wav
                       http://www.example.com/media/Number_11.wav"/>
          <item name="iterations" value="2"/>
       </data>
   </dialogprepare>


   If the dialog is prepared successfully, a dialogprepared message is
   returned:


   <response status="200" dialogid="vxi78"/>


   The prepared dialog is then started on a conference playing the
   prompts twice:


   <dialogstart prepareddialogid="vxi78" conf-id="conference11"/>


   In the case of a successful dialog, the output is provided in
   <event>; for example


   <event name="dialogexit" dialogid="vxi78">
       <data>
          <item name="status" value="1"/>
       </data>
   </event>

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


   In this example, the dialog is started on a sip dialog connection,
   but no <data> is specified:


   <dialogstart src="playannouncement"
                connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns"/>


   and an error message is returned:


   <event name="dialogexit" dialogid="vxi79">
       <data>
          <item name="status" value="602"/>
          <item name="reason" value="prompts not defined"/>
       </data>
   </event>


7.2.  promptandcollect

   This example plays no prompts and just waits for input from the user:


   <dialogstart src="promptandcollect"
                connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns"/>


   If the dialog is successful, then "dialogexit" <event> contains the
   dtmf collected in its result parameter:


   <event name="dialogexit" dialogid="vxi80">
       <data>
          <item name="status" value="1"/>
          <item name="result" value="12345"/>
       </data>
   </event>


   In this example, a prompt is played and then we wait for 3 hours for
   a two digit sequence:

Internet-Draft        Media Server Control Package          October 2006


   <dialogstart src="promptandcollect"
                connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <data>
     <item name="prompts" value="http://www.example.com/prompt1.wav"/>
     <item name="timeout" value="1080s"/>
     <item name="maxdigits" value="2"/>
     <item name="iterations" value="1"/>
    </data>
   </dialogstart>


   If no user input is collected within 3 hours, then following would be
   returned:


   <event name="dialogexit" dialogid="vxi81">
       <data>
          <item name="status" value="603"/>
       </data>
   </event>


   And finally in this example, one of the input parameters is invalid:


   <dialogstart src="promptandcollect"
                connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <data>
      <item name="prompts" value="http://www.example.com/prompt1.wav"/>
      <item name="iterations" value="two"/>
      <item name="cleardigitbuffer" value="true"/>
      <item name="bargein" value="true"/>
      <item name="timeout" value="4s"/>
      <item name="interdigittimeout" value="2s"/>
      <item name="termtimeout" value="0s"/>
      <item name="maxdigits" value="2"/>
    </data>
   </dialogstart>


   The error is reported in a dialogexit <event>:


   <event name="dialogexit" dialogid="vxi82">
       <data>
          <item name="status" value="601"/>
          <item name="reason" value="iterations invalid: two"/>
       </data>

   </event>


7.3.  promptandrecord

   In this example, the user is prompted, then their input is recorded
   for a maximum of 30 seconds.


   <dialogstart src="promptandrecord"
                connection-id="7HDY839~HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
