Abstract

This document describes a CASP client protocol that allows nodes to
signal information to firewalls mainly in an in-path fashion.
The protocol furthermore allows the signaling initiator to establish
and/or learn a NAT binding. This information can then be used
within other protocols such as SIP.

1 Introduction

CASP-Midcom is a client protocol for the Cross-Application Signaling
Protocol (CASP) [1]. It is one of a family of CASP client protocols and
allows the signaling of firewall information along the data path (in-
path) in a topology independent manner. CASP-Midcom aims to address
issues raised in the MIDCOM working group [2] and uses ideas for in-path
signaling using RSVP as described in [3] and in [4]. CASP-Midcom aims to
provide a long-term solution to the MIDCOM problem with the following
properties:

     Routing of Signaling Messages: CASP with its scout discovery
          mechanisms allows signaling messages to follow the path of the
          data traffic towards a destination. This assumes that standard
          routing is used. CASP, however, operates independent of the
          underlying routing mechanism. Route changes can be detected by
          the scout protocol and signaling message transmission is
          adopted accordingly. Other mechanisms for detecting route
          changes can also be used such as routing protocols.

     Security Protection: Creating holes into a firewall is a sensitive
          task that requires trust and an appropriate security
          protection of the signaling messages in order to be
          successful. Trust assumptions between the participating
          entities thereby determine whether the task of installing
          packet filters at a firewall is possible at all.  CASP-Midcom
          thereby reuses the security mechanisms introduced by CASP.
          Still some additional security mechanisms described in this
          document have to be used to provide secure protocol operation.

     Sender/Receiver Initiated: CASP signaling can be executed in
          sender- and receiver initiated mode. Establishment of firewall
          packet filter information is usually done in a asymmetric
          manner e.g.  establishment of unidirectional Traffic Selectors
          at firewalls.

     Flexibility in Message Delivery: Signaling messages can be
          triggered by any node along the path. In most cases, however,
          it is the responsibility of the signaling message initiator
          (typically the end host) to provide the necessary information
          which policy rules to install. CASP messages might terminate
          at any CASP peer along the path. Hence it is not necessary to
          forward the messages to the final destination. The decision
          whether to furthermore forward the signaling message toward
          the destination can be caused by the initiator (by including
          CASP specific information) or the decision could also be
          forced for example by a non CASP-aware firewall. Such a device
          might not forward CASP message. Another example is an

          authorization failure generated because of lacking trust (and
          proper credentials by the signaling initator).

     Error Resilience: CASP was designed based on the soft-state
          principle to allow orphan states to time-out automatically.

     End Host Topology Unawareness: Routing signaling messages along the
          data path allows CASP aware nodes to reflect topology
          information into the processing of CASP signaling messages.
          Processing of Traffic Selectors is an example where local
          topology and protocol information need to be available to
          ensure proper behavior.  Traffic Selector handling is already
          defined in CASP [1]. Defining them at the CASP M-Layer is
          necessary since this object is used by more than one client
          layer protocol.  The Traffic Selector used in CASP-QoS [5]
          messages might be also require modification by a NAT along the
          path.  Mid-path modification of the Traffic Selector allows
          the end host to be topology unaware.  If topology information
          needs to be incorporated into the signaling message processing
          then it should be done at the locations where the
          corresponding information is easily available (for example at
          the individual CASP-Midcom aware nodes along the path).

2 Definitions

     Trust Relationship: The term trust relationship and the
          subcategories is used at various places in this document.
          Since its meaning might confuse some readers a short
          description is given in this section. CASP is a protocol for
          establishing state information within a possibly large number
          of network elements. Unlike to typical end-to-end
          communication protocols there is more than one mean to
          establish trust: end-to-end, end-to-middle, between
          neighboring peers and between non-neighboring peers. Figure 1
          describes these options graphically:


          The existence of a security association (statically or
          dynamically created) requires some degree of trust.  However,
          it does not necessarily lead to the necessary degree of trust
          to allow certain operations to be executed (authorization).
          Hence in this case the term trust is not equal to the
          existence of a security association.  With the creation of
          policy rules at firewalls additional trust might be required
          in addition to a chain-of-trust where only neighboring peers
          trust each other. The principle of chain-of-trust is a
          frequently used concept in the area of QoS signaling
          protocols. In Section 2 of [6] the concept is described in

          more detail.

     Policy Rule: The term policy rule is used as defined in [7]. Other
          frequently used terms are packet filters, filter rules or
          firewall rules. In addition to the Traffic Selector attributes
          an action has to be specified.  Since it was agreed not to
          allow deny rules there are only two possible actions: allow
          without logging and allow with logging.  Per-default no
          logging is defined - the Traffic Selector attribute is used
          without any modification. If logging is desired then it has to
          be specified as described in Section 8. As stated in [7] it
          was agreed not to specify a deny action for policy rule.
          Hence there is no such deny action defined in this document.

     Policy Groups: The term policy group is not used in this document
          since its meaning is partially captured by the Traffic



H. Tschofenig et. al.                                         [Page 4]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


          Selector functionality introduced in CASP. CASP allows various
          Traffic Selector attributes (even lists and ranges of certain
          attributes) to be specified. In case of in-path discovery only
          one IP destination address can be specified inside the Traffic
          Selector in the generic case since it is used routing (and
          hence also used by the scout in-path discovery protocol). For
          off-path signaling this rule must not hold.

     Lifetime of Policy Rules: It is worth mentioning that the lifetime
          specified for policy rules is equal to the established state
          at the C-layer. For the lifetime the following rule applies:
          lifetime(C-Layer) less-or-equal lifetime(M-Layer) less-or-
          equal lifetime(T-Layer). Since the Transport-Layer (T-Layer)
          is shared by many M-Layer session its lifetime is not
          explicitly specified. The lifetime of the T-Layer might depend
          on the local policy but usually it is removed as soon as all
          M-Layer states expired.

     Traffic Selector (TS): The term Traffic Selector refers to
          attributes describing subsets of a data traffic for which a
          specific behavior should be assigned.  In case of firewall
          traversal the term Traffic Selector refers to policy rules (or
          policy groups in case that it is more generalized).  The term
          flow identifier is also often used in the area of QoS
          signaling protocols. For a NAT traversal a Traffic Selector
          refers to the NAT binding.

          There is furthermore a one-to-one relationship between a M-
          layer and a C-layer (state defined in this document including
          policy rules and other parameters) state. If a particular M-
          layer state is removed then also the corresponding C-layer
          state has to be removed. The identification of the both states
          (M-layer and C-layer) is done based on the 128-bit session
          identifier.

3 Trust Relationships

It is unusual to start a protocol description with trust relationships
to explain the basic protocol behavior. A protocol for firewall
traversal is somewhat different since trust relationships are very
important for the protocol design and for its internal mechanisms. It is
worth noting that NAT traversal does not cause problems to the same
degree.

3.1 Peer-to-Peer Trust Relationship

The following scenarios can be considered as the simplest since peer-to-
peer trust relationship exist between the participating entities. These



H. Tschofenig et. al.                                         [Page 5]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


trust relationships are either pre-existing or can be dynamically
established (for example between Host A and the local middlebox i.e.
Middlebox 1 within Network A) as part of the execution of a security
protocol. Authentication and authorization of the request to the
middlebox device is thereby required for successful protocol completion.
Important in this context is the trust relationship between the two
networks (i.e. between Middlebox 1 and Middlebox 2). In this scenario it
is assumed that no firewall is present within the core network. In case
that Middlebox requires authentication of the Host A (or from the user
located at Host A) then an "Authentication Required" RESPONSE message
with an error code is returned to the initiator. In case of a sender-
initiated signaling message transmitted by Host A the requested filter
entries at the first middlebox are already installed when the request at
the subsequent middlebox fails.

Since end hosts usually do not have (and should not have) topology
information of the networks along the path it is not possible to
transmit Traffic Selectors for both directions (if data traffic later
flows in both directions).  Hence it is required that both nodes
transmit separate signaling messages for each direction containing
separate Traffic Selectors for each traffic flow (if the data traffic is
later sent in both directions). These signaling messages are transmitted
by the end hosts and they do not need to travel along the same path.
Therefore the signaling message in both directions do not necessarily
install state at the same firewall.

Policy rules installation is based on the information transmitted with
the Traffic Selector object. Traffic Selectors can change mid-path (for
example when passing a NAT) and are allowed to change mid-session (for
example because of mobility).  For those cases where the information
transported within a Traffic Selector object cannot be interpreted an
error message is returned indicating the inadequate information. Traffic
Selector processing failures are possible when for example a Virtual
Private Network Identifier such as (Extended) Tunnel ID is transmitted
to an IP firewall.


3.2 Intra-domain Trust Relationship

In larger corporations often more than one firewall is used to protect
different departments.  In many cases the entire enterprise is
controlled by a security department which gives instructions to the
department administrators. In such a scenario a peer-to-peer trust-
relationship might be prevalent.  Sometimes, however, it might be
necessary to preserve authentication and authorization information
within the network. In this case an interaction between the individual
middleboxes and a central entity (for example a policy decision point -
PDP) might be required. Each middlebox can either communicate with the

Figure 2: Peer-to-Peer Trust Relationship


PDP or the PDP issues an authorization token which allows the
middleboxes to react independently. Figure 3 refers to this structure.
To avoid complex protocol interactions individual middleboxes within an
administrative domain should make use of their trust relationship
instead of challenging the signaling message originator.


3.3 Required End-to-Middle Trust Relationship

In some scenarios a simple peer-to-peer trust relationship between
participating nodes is not sufficient. Network B might require some
proof of identity of the signaling message originator. If such a proof
is not included in the signaling message arriving at Middlebox 2 then a
RESPONSE message with an error code "Authentication Required" is
returned. However, in many cases the user initiating the signaling
message exchange is already aware of such a constraint and received
credentials before the message exchange was started. These credentials
might be based either on symmetric (shared secret) or based on
asymmetric (public key) cryptography. In order to avoid a
challenge/response type of message exchange and to reuse the CASP

security mechanisms the initiating node (Host A in this case) already
includes a CMS object to the outgoing signaling message. The CMS object
contains the identity of the signaling initiator, the identity of the
network, the destination address of Host B, a timestamp for replay
protection and possibly some other application specific information like
an application identifier. CMS allows to use both symmetric and
asymmetric credentials.

Figure 4 shows the slightly more complex trust relationships in this
scenario.


3.4 Missing Network-to-Network Trust Relationship

Peer-to-peer trust relationship as shown in Figure 2 is a very
convenient assumption that allows simplified signaling message
processing. However, it is obvious that such an assumption does not
always hold. Especially the trust relationship between two arbitrary

non-adjacent access networks is likely non-existent because of the large
number of networks and the unwillingness of administrators to have other
network operators to create holes in their firewalls. Hence in the
following scenario we assume a somewhat different message processing and
show three possible approaches. None of these three approaches is
without drawbacks or constraining assumptions.


We identified three possible approaches of tackling the problem
described in Figure 5.

     Receiver-Initiated Signaling The first approach makes use of
          receiver-based signaling message exchange. If Host A sends a
          signaling message toward the destination to Middlebox 1 the
          message can be properly protected.  Middlebox 1 establishes
          some state information and expects a incoming message
          initiated by Host B. Signaling message protection between the

Figure 5: Missing Network-to-Network Trust Relationship


          two networks is difficult. The missing trust relationship does
          not necessarily mean that no security association
          establishment is possible. The lacking trust "only" disallows
          Middlebox 1 to create packet filters at Middlebox 2. If the
          CASP message itself is allowed to pass the firewall then it
          finally reaches Host B. Host B should not experience any
          difficulties to install filters at the local firewall
          (Middlebox 2). The message is then forwarded to Middlebox 1
          which already waits for the incoming signaling message.
          Because it is possible to associate existing state information
          at Middlebox 1 with the incoming message packet filters are
          installed and the message is finally forwarded to Host A.
          Authorization for packet filter installation in Network A has
          to be provided by Host A and for Network B has to be provided
          by Host B when returning the response message. Traffic
          Selectors are installed for data traffic from Host A to Host
          B. The same procedure has to be applied again to signal
          information for the other direction (Host B to Host A).

          The following behavior has to be assumed in order for this
          approach to be applicable:

          - CASP signaling messages must be allowed to pass firewalls
            along the path. Blocking CASP messages at firewalls
            disallows the receiver of the signaling message to return a
            signaling message.

          - The PATH message is assumed to be stateful.

          This approach suffers from the following drawbacks:

          - If CASP signaling messages are not allowed to bypass a
            firewall then no policy rules are create at any node along
            the path.

          - Receiver-Initiated signaling has the advantage that the
            receiver has to accept the creation of the policy rule in
            his own network to trigger the creation locally. This seems
            to simplify security processing. If a NAT is present then
            still a RESPONSE message is required to inform the data
            message sender about the NAT-binding (i.e. the IP addresses
            and port information seen by a data traffic receiver).

     Access Network-Only Signaling Message Exchange The next approach is
          based on signaling Traffic Selector information by both hosts
          into the local access network only. CASP allows to specify
          such a behavior by indicating the signaling endpoint with the
          help of scoping ( for example with domain name). If packet
          filters for both directions have to be installed then
          signaling messages have to make reservations up- and
          downstream along the data path. Similar to proposals in the
          area of QoS signaling some problems are likely to occur. One
          such problem is that downstream reservations in general does
          not work due to the policy of routing protocols and the
          asymmetric routes. The problem of triggering downstream
          reservations is for example described in [8]. Another problem
          for example is the placement of a firewall or NAT along the
          path other than in the access network. This would prevent a
          successful data exchange.

          The following behavior has to be assumed in order for this
          approach to be applicable:

          - Triggering a signaling message downstream must be possible.
            Thereby the correct firewall should be affected where later
            data traffic enters the domain.




H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 11]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


          - No other firewalls or NATs are present along the path other
            than in the access network.

          This approach suffers from the following drawbacks:

          - To signal policy rules only within the access network (by
            both end-points) has a number of disadvantage and challenges
            as described in various source including [8]. The complex
            message processing caused by this approach stronly argues
            against it although it might sound simple (and even might be
            simple in restricted environments). Section 9 also addressed
            message flows for this case. Although its usage is possible
            with CASP we strongly discourage its usage.

          - Some circumstances can lead to ineffective policy rules.

     Authorization Tokens The last approach is based on some exchanged
          authorization tokens which are created by an authorized entity
          (such as the PDP) in each access network. Both hosts need to
          exchange these tokens with some protocols such as SIP or HTTP
          which is more likely to allowed to bypass the firewall. Later
          when the CASP-Midcom signaling messages are exchanged the
          token is included. Host A would then include the received
          token for Network B. When the signaling message arrives at
          Middlebox 2 then the token is verified by the token-creating
          entity. To avoid reusing of the token a timestamp has to be
          included. Adding IP address information about Host A would
          create difficulties in relationship with NATs. Information
          about Host B might be possible to include in order to limit
          attacks where a token is lost and reused to a different host
          for a different purpose. The goal is to restrict the token.
          Which information can be safely included inside the token
          might also be implementation specified since it only has to be
          verified locally.  Some further investigation is required.

          The following behavior has to be assumed in order for this
          approach to be applicable:

          - The exchange of authorization tokens between end-systems
            must be possible. These protocols must be allowed to pass
            the firewalls.

          - An end-system must be able to request such an authorization
            token at some entity in the local network.

          This approach suffers from the following drawback:





H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 12]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


          - An additional protocol is required for an end host to
            request an authorization token from an entity in the local
            network as depicted in Section 9. Note that CASP could be
            extended to provide this functionality but currently it does
            not.

3.5 Off-Path Signaling

The separation of message delivery and next-hop discovery for the CASP
protocol allows it to support in-path and off-path signaling easily with
the same protocol. Throughout this document in-path signaling was
assumed (the Scout protocol is used per-default for next peer discovery)
but off-path signaling might be required in some scenarios where a
third-party entity wants to signal some policy rules to a firewall. This
mechanism has disadvantages in larger networks with multiple firewalls
since topology information is required in order not to install policy
rules at the wrong device.

4 Assumptions

Based on the above-described trust relationships the following protocol
assumptions have to be made.

     ú Middleboxes along the path are CASP-aware. If a middlebox is not
       CASP-aware then protocol functionality can not be fully
       guaranteed.  The CASP-Midcom protocol can operate with
       limitations if a CASP-unaware firewall blocks all CASP signaling
       traffic.  To support CASP-unaware NATs along the path some
       information needs to be added to a CASP-Midcom message to allow
       the signaling message receiving entity to verify that the source
       ip address (and port numbers) have changed. Currently no such
       object is included in this version of the document.

     ú The end host should not be required to know the topology of the
       networks along the path or some other network internal issues.
       Therefore it is not possible to make an assumption about routing
       and hence we have to assume asymmetric routes. As a consequence
       end hosts include unidirectional Traffic Selectors only. Within a
       administrative domain where more information is available this
       assumption might not hold and the establishment of bi-directional
       Traffic Selectors could be possible.

5 NAT Involvement

Two issues need to be addressed when NATs are present along the path.
Since the end host should not a-priori knowledge about the location,
number and types of NATs along the path their presence has to be
assumed.



H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 13]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


First the CASP signaling messages must be able to traverse a non-CASP
aware NAT box without major problems. Since CASP uses transport
protocols such as TCP or SCTP a NAT is able to maintain a binding. Note
that non-CASP aware NATs prevent the successful installation of packet
filters at subsequent CASP-aware firewalls.  In case that the NAT is
CASP-aware problems only occur if source port numbers are fixed. So far
CASP does not require fixed source port numbers to be used.

The second issue addresses data packets for which a NAT binding needs to
be requested. When an end host starts to transmit scout packets to
discover the presence of firewalls/NATs along the path it is willing to
subsequently transmit data packets with a given Traffic Selector.
Subsequently such a firewall/nat/firewall scenario is described to
explain the basic protocol interaction and the usefulness allowing
Traffic Selectors to change mid-path (i.e. along the path). Mid-session
changes of Traffic Selectors happen in mobility cases (for example if
the end host obtains a new care-of address).


In Figure 6 a hosts (Host A) wants to enable transmit data traffic from
source IP address 192.168.1.5 to a given destination IP address (not
shown in the Figure 6) at port 666 (both udp and tcp).  Therefore Host A
transmits a CASP-Midcom message to Firewall 1 (after discovering that
this firewall is along the data path) to create the corresponding packet
filters. Note that the traffic selector is unidirectional. This scenario
shows a sender-initiated scenario. Firewall 1 installs two policy rules
(one for udp and the other one for tcp) after successful authentication
and authorization. After forwarding to the next middlebox (a NAT in this
case) a NAT binding has to be created for the given traffic selectors.
The externally visible Traffic Selector (IP address changed to
139.23.203.30 and port number=7000) is then forwarded to the next
firewall (Firewall 2). Firewall 2 again creates policy rules after
authentication and authorization. Then the message is forwarded towards
the destination.

After the signaling messages reaches its target (the destination IP
address) or until no further firewall can be reached (for example
because the message is rejected at a non CASP-aware firewall) a RESPONSE
message is returned (if requested by the signaling message initiator). A
RESPONSE message would contain a Status object which includes
information about the applied Traffic Selector and whether the message
reached its target or not. In case of NATs along the path the Traffic
Selector information is then included in protocols like SIP to
communicate on which protocol/port data will be sent.

Section 9 additionally addresses some message flows with NAT
involvement.

Figure 6: NAT Involvement


6 Operation

CASP-Midcom defines the following message types:

     Path: A PATH message allows a receiver-initiated reservation
          approach. This message does not cause packet filters to be
          installed although all objects are present. This message is
          then used as a trigger to cause a CREATE to be returned. The
          PATH message transmitting entity includes the objects which
          are later used (if not modified) by the sender of the CREATE
          message.

     Create: A CREATE message allows to establish or update state at one
          or more firewall(s).  Verification is necessary to ensure that
          policy rule creation is allowed by the requesting entity and
          that no other local security policy is violated. In case a
          security policy is violated or the creation of the policy



H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 15]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


          rule(s) is not permitted, a RESPONSE message with a "Security
          Policy Violated" error code is returned. If the CREATE message
          is used without a previous PATH message then it represents a
          typical sender-initiated reservation.

     Release: A RELEASE message is used to delete installed state at a
          firewall/NAT explicitly without waiting for a soft-state
          timeout. This message can only delete previously installed
          state.  Referring to previously installed state can easily be
          done using the session identifier.

     Response: A RESPONSE message is either sent to acknowledge a
          previous message or to indicate an error.  In case of an
          acknowledgement it is required that the signaling message
          initiator requests the transmission of a response message.
          Therefore the Next object is set to the Response message. No
          state information is modified by processing and forwarding an
          acknowledgement.  If an error has to be returned then the
          error code inside the RESPONSE message allows to specify more
          detailed error information.  Such an error code might for
          example indicate missing user specific credentials, a missing
          authorization token or a security policy violation. Detailed
          error codes have to be defined in future versions of this
          document.

     Query: A QUERY message triggers a RESPONSE message to return
          installed state information. The main purpose of this message
          is to provide diagnostic facilities. An initiator must only be
          able to query owned state information. Otherwise the entire
          set of policy rules of a firewall could be retrieved which
          causes security concerns. An adversary would have a simple
          mechanism to retrieve a lot of useful information for
          subsequent attacks.

     Trigger: Some sort of trigger message is required to support access
          network signaling message exchanges as described in Section 9
          and in Section 3.4. (TBD: This usefulness of this message or
          other technical alternatives require some investigation.)

The following table shows the basic message behavior whereby the
following abbreviations are used: MAY (O), MUST NOT (--), MUST (M) or NA
(not applicable))

The operations specify which message might indicate information to
trigger which other message in response by the other end.  Some messages
(such as an error message) are created automatically without previous
indication.

Msg/Next Msg  Path  Create  Release  Response  Query  Trigger

Path          NA    M       --       O         --     --
Create        O     O       --       O         --     --

Trigger       O     O       O?       --        --     NA


Note that the "Must" entries in the table above indicate only the
default behavior. For example: A PATH message must be followed by a
CREATE message. However, in case of an error a RESPONSE message (with an
error code) will be returned.

The following issues still require some investigations:

     - To enable a bi-directional reservation the sender of a CREATE
       message has to indicate either another CREATE message in the Next
       object or a PATH message. It is questionable whether a sender-
       initiated signaling message should follow a receiver-initiated?

     - Is it useful to allow a RESPONSE or a RELEASE message to follow a
       RELEASE message?

7 Typical Policy Rule Attributes

Traffic Selectors used in CASP are used to install policy rules in
firewalls. This paragraph describes some typically used attributes.
Other attributes such as flow labels might be used but are considered as
an exception.  We believe that a granularity at transport layer protocol
state-level (syn, syn/ack, ack, etc.) is not required.

     - Source/destination IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

     - Port numbers (possibly including ranges and a list of port
       numbers)

     - Transport protocol (for example TCP, UDP)

     - SPI (for IPSec protected data traffic)

     - Identifiers for AH and ESP (Protocol numbers, next headers
       fields)

A NAT object returned to the signaling message initiator contains the
same attribute types. The NAT object is included as a payload in the
Status object. A signaling message originator may also use the NAT



H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 17]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


object to request a particular NAT binding to take place. The same
object is used for this purpose.

There are only two actions defined for a policy rule: "allow / no
logging" (default) and "allow / logging". The first action does not
require additional objects to be included other than the Traffic
Selector. This is the default action.  If a "allow / logging" action has
to be specified then the Logging Action object defined in 8 has to be
included. This action creates log entries whenever the rule was
triggered. End hosts are usually not allowed to specify this behavior
because it could be used for a denial of service attack to cause log
files to grow quickly and without bounds.

Note that a single Traffic Selector might also specify a range or ports.
Furthermore it is also possible to specify more than one Traffic
Selector object within a single signaling message.

8 Objects

The following objects are used by the CASP-Midcom client protocol:

8.1 Logging Action

This object indicates which Traffic Selector(s) want to have logging
specified. Note that end host are usually not allowed to specify this
behavior for in-path signaling. It might, however, be requested within the
network or in case of off-path signaling. (TBD: Some investigation is
required to evaluate whether this action is really required.)

8.2 ApplicationID

This object contains an identifier to provide more information about the
data for which the policy rule is installed. Application-level firewalls
and firewalls with stateful inspection are able to use this information.
Providing a wrong application identifier for a given data traffic would
then cause a processing failure. Such a behavior is more secure than a
traditional packet filter firewall. Note that encrypted end-to-end
traffic might reduce this advantage to some degree.  A local
security policy might indicate that this information is required before
creating policy rules. A missing ApplicationID object would then cause a
"Application ID require" RESPONSE message with an error code is
returned.

8.3 Next

The Next object indicates the next request that the signaling message
receiver should generate if the incoming message was successfully
processed. Section 6 shows possible combinations of messages. For



H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 18]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


example, a CREATE message might contain a Next object which is set to
CREATE causing another create message to be returned.  Such a message
flow would represent a bi-directional reservation. A frequently used
object is the response object providing indications about a previously
submitted message.

8.4 Authorization Token

This object is used as described in Figure 5 of Section 3.4.  More
description will be added in the near future (see Section 11).

8.5 CMS Credential Object

This object allows user specific cryptographic credentials to be
transmitted some CASP peers (or networks) along the path. Figure 4
describes a scenario where such an object is required.  Attributes
included in this object are also briefly mentioned in Section 3.3.

8.6 Time

This object indicates that filters should be installed somewhere in the
near future. This might be required in the context of in-advance QoS
reservation for a conferencing scenario. If this object is not present,
the current time is used.

8.7 Version

The version indication is used to quickly determine whether any of the
object has changed (for example Traffic Selector), without having to do
a bit-by-bit comparison. The Version object might be useful for messages
which refresh established state information only. Uniqueness of the
Version object is only required for a session. Whenever state
information has to be modified then a new value has to be placed in the
Version object. A high-resolution timestamp is typically used for this
purpose.

8.8 Status

The Status object is used to deliver status information inside the
RESPONSE message.  This object might return error notifications or
information about installed Traffic Selectors (e.g. NAT-Object).
Delivering Traffic Selector information is helpful for application that
need to deliver IP address, protocol type and port information to the
initiator in case of NATs along the path. One such protocol is SIP.

9 Basic Protocol Behavior





H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 19]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


The following message flows try to show the basic protocol behavior and
possible combinations regarding sender- and receiver-initiated messages
flows, uni-directional/bi-directional Traffic Selectors, different trust
assumptions and NAT and/or Firewall traversal.  The subsequently shown
figures do not include message flows for next-peer discovery (for
example using the Scout protocol).

9.1 Receiver-Initiated Message Flow with Firewalls

The following message flow shows the protocol behavior in case of a
receiver-initiated signaling message exchange with two administrative
domains (Network A and B) and two firewalls located at the borders.  For
the message flow a peer-to-peer trust relationship is assumed.
Cryptographic credentials which support end-to-middle authentication
(Host A-to-FW 2) can be included by Host A into the PATH message. The
usage of receiver-initiation has the advantage that Host B has to assist
in policy rule installation at Firewall B.


In Figure 7 the sender indicates which policy rule to install by adding
this information to the Traffic Selector. Host A uses the IP address
139.23.203.23 and the destination IP address (Host B) is 17.12.23.5.
Note that the transport protocol is not mentioned since it is not
helpful. The first firewall (FW 1) installs the indicated policy rule
(Traffic Selector with actional "allow / without logging").  The message
is forwarded to the next CASP aware node (FW 2). Because of the peer-to-
peer trust assumption FW 2 trusts FW1 for the correctness of the
provided parameters. The identity of the signaling message originator
might be included in the signaling messages addressed toward the other
end host. Policy rules are installed at both firewalls. When the
signaling message reaches Host B then a CREATE message is returned in
response and included the same Traffic Selector (unmodified).  Note that
the Traffic Selector is always directional (especially for the CREATE
message in response to a PATH message this is applicable). The CREATE
message installs the policy rules at the two firewalls. The CREATE
message finally reaches Host A who can immediately start to transmit
data traffic towards Host B.

The following issues arise with the description of the message flow of
Figure 7:

     - Should Traffic Selector information included in the PATH and
       CREATE message. Traffic Selector information in the PATH message
       could be temporarily stored at middleboxes (in this firewalls).
       The CREATE message would then only refer to existing state
       information.

Figure 7: Receiver-Initiated Message Flow with Firewalls

     - It does not seem to be useful to have a stateless version of the
       PATH message. Do we want to support such a stateless version?

     - If the Path message fails then no policy rules are installed. The
       signaling message flow has to be restart.

Figure 7 does not contain NATs, micro-/macro-mobility specific message
flows or any form of tunneling. Hence no Traffic Selector modification
mid-path is necessary. Such a Traffic Selector modification would be
required otherwise.  Entities which are aware of micro-/macro-mobility
protocols (for example a MAP or a home agent) are no middleboxes in the
traditional sense. Since they have an impact on the Traffic Selector and
on the data traffic it would be necessary to treat them as artificial
middlebox to properly address flow identifications along the path. If no
such treatment takes place then the wrong policy rules are installed at
firewalls with the consequence that the entire protocol interaction is
useless. In this description we assume that Traffic Selector attributes
are based on information used for routing (i.e. IP addresses).

9.2 Sender-Initiated Message Flow with Firewalls

The following message flow shows the protocol behavior in case of a
sender-initiated signaling message exchange with two administrative
domains (Network A and B) and two firewalls (FW 1 and FW 2).  No NAT and
other devices requiring modifications to the Traffic Selector are used.
This message flow also assumes a peer-to-peer trust relationship.
Cryptographic credentials which support end-to-middle authentication
(Host A-to-FW 2) can be included by Host A into the CREATE message.


The message flow in Figure 8 is similar to Figure 7. The CREATE message
contains the Traffic Selector and immediately (after authentication,
authorization and verification) causes the installation of policy rules.
The signaling message sender might request a RESPONSE message.  In case
of NATs along the path such a RESPONSE message is very useful to return
NAT binding information.

This scenario does not require Traffic Selector modification along the
path. No NAT binding is returned with the optional RESPONSE message.

The following issue arises with the description of the message flow of
Figure 8:

     - If a verification error is caused during the CREATE message
       processing then some firewalls might have installed policy rules
       whereas others have never seen the signaling message. A RESPONSE
       message indicating an error could leave installed state in place
       or cause already established state to be removed automatically.

Figure 8: Sender-Initiated Message Flow with Firewalls


9.3 Receiver-Initiated Message Flow with a Firewall and a NAT

The message flow in Figure 9 introduces a NAT box (NAT 1) along the path
between Host A and Host B additional to a firewall at Network B.  Note
that NAT 1 might additionally have firewall functionality which would
require to install policy rules in addition to to obtain a NAT binding.
The message flow assumes that Host A with source IP address 10.1.0.5
wants to transmit data traffic at source port 1200 (for example UDP /
not shown in this example) to destination address 17.12.23.5 at
destination port number 600. Host A does not requires a particular NAT

binding. Instead the provided NAT binding is provided as a NAT-Object in
response. If Host A would like to request a particular NAT binding then
the NAT-Object has to be included in the initial PATH message.

As soon as the signaling message reaches NAT 1 a NAT binding is
requested and the result of this request is placed into the Traffic
selector field (i.e. src ip address is changed from 10.1.0.5 to
139.23.203.30 and the sport is rewritten from 1200 to 5000).  When the
signaling messages is successfully processed by FW 2 and forwarded to
Host B a CREATE message with the indicated Traffic Selector is returned.
A copy of the received Traffic Selector is placed into the NAT-Object.
By returning the NAT-Object information Host A is able to learn which IP
address and port information is seen by Host B. This IP address and port
information would then included in for example a SDP of a SIP message.
The CREATE message is routed backwards toward Host A (since the path is
pinned down).

The exchange of end-to-end messages after a successful signaling message
exchange might be required to exchange parameters about the subsequent
data traffic. Finally Host A starts to transmit data packets to Host B.


9.4 Sender-Initiated Message Flow with a Firewall and a NAT

Figure 10 shows a sender-initiated signaling message flow whereby FW 2
in Network B initially rejects the signaling message due to an
authentication/authorization failure. The returned RESPONSE message
includes among the error code, information about the entity creating the
error (in this case FW2@NetworkB) and optionally a challenge value. The
challenge value allows Host A to either provide a freshness guarantee
based on the challenge value and/or based on a timestamp. The usage of
CMS allows Host A and Network B to use symmetric and asymmetric
credentials for authentication. In any case a Credential object is
attached to the CREATE signaling message.  The Credential object
securely binds a timestamp or a sequence number (to prevent replay
attacks), identities, lifetime and possibly Traffic Selector information
to the cryptographic credentials. Note that the RESPONSE message might
return a NAT-Object if requested.

Host A retransmits a new signaling message. After verification of the
request and the credentials FW 2 forwards the message to Host B. As in
previous examples Host B returns a RESPONSE message with a NAT-Object
back to Host A.


The message flow shows the following protocol features:

       error message is returned. However, in that case replay protection
       can only be based on timestamps (loosely synchronized clocks).

     - A NAT-Object is included in the RESPONSE message to let the
       signaling message initiator to return the public IP address.

     - The RESPONSE message indicating an error could also return a NAT-
       Object to provide initial information to the

     - The same protocol operations can be used without NATs (only
       firewalls).

9.5 Sender-Initiated NAT/Firewall Traversal with Authorization Token

The next scenario is slightly more complicated in the sense that
authorization information for Network B is provided by Host B. Host B
first request an authorization token from an entity in the local network
by some means. This token is then communicated to Host A using an end-
to-end protocol such as SIP or HTTP. This token then provides the
necessary trust for Network B to allow the CREATE message to install
policy rules at FW 2. Note that this message flow is different compared
to the scenario described in Figure 10. In this case no pre-established
cryptographic credentials between Host A and Network B are present
before the protocol is used between Host A and Host B.

The sender-initiated message flow is similar to the above-described
flows with the only exception that the Authorization Token is included.
The token is removed at FW 2 after successful verification.


9.6 Sender-Initiated Firewall Signaling only at the Access Network

Sometimes people argue that the signaling message exchange should be
done locally at the network access only because per-flow signaling
messages are not processed in the core network. Instead of sending the
signaling messages from one access network to the other whereby the
signaling messages are transparent in the core each host transmits
signaling messages independently in its own network. Although the
concept sounds very simple at the first glance it turns out to be very
complex in the generic case. Most difficulties appear because of the
asymmetric routing architecture. Establishing policy rules in the uplink
direction is fairly simple and requires only a mechanism which allows
some sort of scoping (i.e. signaling messages have to terminate
somewhere in the access network) without actually indicating the end-
point. Casp provides means for scoping and local access network
signaling. The installation of policy rules on the downlink
direction is complicated because some topology information inside the
network must be known in order to avoid policy rule creation at the

fail (i.e. to install policy rules at the wrong location).

For the message flow described in Figure 12 we assume the following
protocol behavior:

     - Host A and Host B initiate a bi-directional Traffic Selector
       establishment with a scope restricted to the local access network
       only. Without some sort of bi-directional signaling message
       exchange a sort of TRIGGER message is required to initiate a
       downlink Traffic Selection establishment.

     - Based on the characteristics of signaling message exchanges local
       at both access networks assumptions about the topology must be
       made (or some topology information must be known).

     - In this simplified message flow no NAT device is present.

     - Host A has a-priori knowledge about the Traffic Selector for the
       inbound traffic (i.e. src=17.12.23.5 and sport=601).


With the initial CREATE message Host A already supplies Traffic Selector
information for the bi-directional reservation (i.e. the CREATE message
by Host A is followed by another CREATE message from FW 1). To kept the
CREATE signaling message within the local access network scoping is
used. Indicating a particular IP address might also be possible but
often the endpoint is unknown to the end host. As a result of successful
processing a CREATE message is returned in response with the already
provided Traffic Selector.

Optionally an end-to-end message communication might follow to transmit
Traffic Selector information from Host A to Host B.  In most cases some
communication is, however, required. Similar as in Network A a CREATE
message is initiated by the end host with the Next object set to another
CREATE message.

Finally if everything was successful data can be exchanged in both
directions on port 5001<-601 and a 5000->600.

9.7 Sender-Initiated NAT and Firewall Traversal within the Access
Network

The message flow described in Figure 13 extends the description in
Figure 12 by using a uni-directional signaling exchange. As a
consequence of this extension a TRIGGER message is required to cause a
downlink signaling message to be sent within Network B. In order to
avoid this message Network B could intercept the end-to-end message
exchange to trigger a signaling message to Host B.  However, this
approach might suffer from the problem to be able to read and evaluate
end-to-end signaling messages.

Additionally a NAT device is used in Network A which requires Host A to
request a NAT binding and the corresponding NAT-Object which is then
communicated to Host B. Using the Traffic Selector information inside
the NAT-Object Host B learns the public IP address and port information
of the data traffic transmitted by Host A.

The access network signaling message exchange requires some topology
information as explained in previous figures. The TRIGGER message must
cause a downlink signaling message to be initiated by a network device
which where the data traffic of Host A is sent through.

A even more difficult example would address a topology where each
network is equipped with a NAT. The same is true for Traffic Selector
installation for data traffic flowing in both directions with one or two
NATs.


10 Security Considerations

Installing packet filters to one or more firewalls is a security
sensitive process. Security protection of signaling messages is
necessary in order to defeat a number of threats. This section gives a
brief discussion of possible threats and addresses their corresponding
countermeasures.

10.1 Threats

     Denial of Service: Denial of service attacks can be launched by
          modifying messages used during the discovery process. A client
          could then be forced to contact a "wrong" firewall which is
          outside the data path.  Furthermore it is possible to flood a
          firewall with bogus request and thereby cause massive state
          and computational resources to be allocated as part of the key
          exchange process. Furthermore an adversary can modify the
          Traffic Selector of a request to cause a large number of
          packet filters to be allocated. An adversary might also remove
          administrator installed packet filters which are not related
          to previous packet filter installations by users.

     Man-in-the-Middle: MITM attacks are possible during the discovery
          process where the entity of a firewall is discovered. In this
          case the user might be convinced to communicate with a
          firewall which is not the case. Many of these attacks are
          related to the discovery mechanism and therefore also
          described in [1]. Further threats which are not specific to
          the scout mechanism but also related to the next-hop discovery
          mechanism require further investigation (such as SLP, DHCP,
          DNS, etc.). The authors of some of these configuration
          mechanisms have already identified potential vulnerabilities
          and provide the corresponding security protection.

     Eavesdropping: An eavesdropper might be able to learn some
          installed packet filters by listening to the signaling message
          communication between a client and a firewall. Furthermore it

          might be possible to learn an authorization token exchanged
          between the two entities or between entities along the path.
          Since the session identifier is used to uniquely identify
          state establish along entities along the path an adversary

Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


          might reuse this identifier to refer to existing state
          information.

     Integrity Violation: By modifying a request message an adversary
          can delete installed firewall filters, install filters using a
          different authorization identity or to create filters with a
          large lifetime.

     Masquerading: An adversary might gain information by querying
          installed packet filters at a firewall by masquerading the
          identify or a real user. This might be used for subsequent
          attacks.

     Rogue Firewall: An adversary at a compromised firewall might
          exploit an existing trust relationship to install or remove
          filters at other firewalls. Furthermore it is possible to
          return a NAT object with wrong information causing subsequent
          data traffic to be send to an arbitrary location.

     Unauthorized Access: A regular user might install firewall filters
          although he is not allowed because of missing authorization.
          Administrators are usually very concerned about installing
          packet filters from users access from an external network.

     Replay Attacks: An adversary might eavesdrop CASP-Midcom signaling
          messages and use them later for a replay attack. Furthermore
          an adversary might be able to collect authorization tokens and
          reuse them in a different context or later in time to open
          holes into a firewall.

     Privacy Violation: Adversaries can learn about the identities
          participating in the message exchange by eavesdropping
          information exchanged between the two end-systems. Especially
          authorization tokens exchanged between end-systems outside the
          CASP protocol (as explained in Section 3.4) represent a
          vulnerability.

10.2 Countermeasures

To prevent the above-listed attacks a number of countermeasures are
taken:

     Denial of Service: To limit denial of service attacks a number of
          countermeasure were taken. First the scout protocol (and other
          configuration mechanisms) experience some protection to
          prevent basic attacks. Furthermore it is necessary to mutually
          authenticate and authorize both peers after establishing a
          transport layer connection as described in [1].  Since the



H. Tschofenig et. al.                                        [Page 33]






Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


          authentication and key exchange protocol requires state and
          computational resources it has to be resistant against denial
          of service attacks. When transmitting CASP-Midcom specific
          information protection of the requests itself is necessary to
          prevent an adversary from object modification which otherwise
          would cause unpredictable behavior.

     Man-in-the-Middle: MITM attacks during the discovery phase are
          prevented by secure configuration mechanisms.  The scout
          protocol experiences limited security protection by its
          nature. An authentication and authorization step is
          required after learning the identity of the next CASP peer.
          MITM adversaries will experience difficulties launching a
          successful attack after transport layer connection
          establishment because of the signaling message protection.

     Eavesdropping: Eavesdropping of signaling messages is prevented by
          using either IPSec ESP (without NULL encryption) or by using
          TLS (with encryption cipher-suites). It is therefore not
          possible to learn authorization tokens, session identifiers or
          other firewall packet filter specific information that might
          be useful for an adversary eavesdropping on for example a
          wireless link. With the suggested security protection
          eavesdropping is therefore only possible at CASP-Midcom aware
          nodes participating in the signaling message exchange. This
          is, however, intentional and required for the operation of the
          protocol.

     Integrity Violation: Modifying the content of signaling packets is
          prevented by either IPSec or TLS. Exchanged information
          thereby experiences both confidentiality as well as integrity
          protection. The usage of integrity protection with IPSec ESP
          is strongly recommended.

     Masquerading: Spoofing an identity to be able to delete or query
          installed packet filter information is prevented by data
          origin authentication of transmitted signaling messages. For
          the establishment of the required security associations mutual
          authentication is assumed.

     Rogue CASP-Midcom Node: Firewalls are security sensitive network
          devices. An adversary can use a compromised firewall in a
          number of ways. To prevent a compromised firewall to harm
          other firewalls trust might be limited and strong verification
          of request might be required. In case of missing peer-to-peer
          trust relationships more sophisticated protocol handling (as
          described in 3.3 and 3.4) is necessary. Such a handling makes
          it more difficult for an adversary to perform a successful

          attack. Note that any malicious CASP-Midcom (or CASP node in
          general) can impact the security of other entities (not just
          firewalls).

     Unauthorized Access: Differentiation of access rights between
          various users and user-groups is common. The same type of
          authorization mechanisms based on access control lists can be
          applied. If authorization tokens are used then additionally a
          locally known user must be able to request such a token. For
          the trust relationship described in 3.3 one administrative
          domain must have a pre-established security association. The
          establishment of such this security association is usually
          bound to some access control rights.

     Privacy Violation: Encryption of information about user identities
          contained in authorization token prevents an adversary from
          obtaining user specific information. Currently only a keyed
          message digest function (HMAC) is provided to protect the
          authorization token content against modification. Either a
          custom mechanisms for encrypting some token parts or CMS
          encryption could be used to provide the necessary protection.
          Further investigation is required.

To summarize: CASP relies on the security mechanisms described in [1].
Securing the messaging layer in a CASP-peer to CASP-peer fashion is
provided either by IPsec or by TLS. Non peer-to-peer protection of
client layer objects is provided by CMS which allows CASP-Midcom objects
defined in this document to be encapsulated and protected by CMS.

11 Open Issues

     - The format of the objects need more work.

     - The structure of the authorization token needs more
       investigation. There is also a question about a custom token
       format or a CMS object. Both have advantages and disadvantages.

     - Terminology needs to be aligned with the Midcom Requirements and
       Framework drafts. Issues (such as groups of policy rules)
       discussed in these documents have to be mapped against the issues
       in this draft.

     - Traffic Selector attributes need some work to avoid the complex
       verification in case of overlapping rules. It must not be
       possible to prevent an administrator-created deny policy rule to
       become ineffective by an added allow policy rule with an
       overlapping port range. Hence it might be necessary to have an
       additional verification step to prevent these type of problems.

A Object Format Details

For concreteness, we describe a strawman packet format below.

All CASP messages are composed of one or more TLV (type-length-value)
objects. Within each object, elements are aligned on multiples of their
size, to speed processing. All objects have lengths of a multiple of 32
bits. The length field in the object indicates the number of 32-bit
words.

We describe messages and objects as pseudo-C structures. Elements are
enumerated in transmission order. We use the data types uint8, uint16,
uint32, uint64, uint128 to identify unsigned integers with 8, 16, 32, 64
or 128 bits, respectively.

Definitions for IPv4 and IPv6 address for the usage with Traffic
Selectors are already provided in [1].

IPSec ESP and AH SPIs is four bytes in length.


typedef struct uint32 SPI;



Using a custom authorization token format might be more lightweight.
(TBD: Authorization tokens can either be defined as CMS objects or as a
objects with a custom structure. Using CMS object would simplify its
definition and would allow a more generic usage. CMS objects are
larger in size than custom build tokens. Some investigation is required
to find the optional usage.)

The following fields could be included in such a token:


typedef struct {
   uint32 ID;
   Identity token_creator, token_requestor, token_user;
   Identity src_addr, dst_addr;
   NTP_TIMESTAMP timestamp;
   uint8 AlgorithmID;
   uint8 HMAC[20];

Internet Draft                 CASP Midcom               23 October 2002


   ...Object describing the authorized TS....
} AuthToken;



An authorization token is identified by a 32-bit number.  The src_addr
and the dst_addr attribute might contains an IPv4, IPv6 address or a
FQDN.  The Identity can either be a generic Unicode and ASCII ID, a FQDN
or a URI.  Unicode Identifiers (Unicode_ID), ASCII Identifiers and FQDNs
are defined in [9].  The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) is defined
in [10].

Since a NAT may change the source address it is possible to specify a
FQDN, URI or an ASCII/Unicode ID or to omit the field.  The
token_creator specifies the identity of the entity which was responsible
for the creation of the token. Information about this entity is
necessary to route the token to the same entity for verification.
Information about the entity requesting the token might be required.
Finally the user identity obtained from authentication might be
included. Especially if authentication to a firewall in the middle of
the CASP-chain is required then this information provides additional
authorization information.

For cryptographic protection of the authorization token a keyed message
digest HMAC [11] is used whereby the used algorithm (MD5, SHA-1) is
indicated in the AlgorithmID field.  The secret key necessary for the
HMAC computation needs to be locally known only since verification is
done at the token creator.  The format of the NTP timestamp is defined
in [12].  Finally the object contains information about the authorized
Traffic Selector. Since a NAT might change some of this information its
usefulness is questionable.
