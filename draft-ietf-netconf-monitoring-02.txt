Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2008


Abstract

   This document defines NETCONF content via XML Schema to be used to
   monitor the NETCONF protocol.  It includes information about NETCONF
   sessions, locks, and subscriptions and is intended to facilitate
   management of a NETCONF server.

   In addition this memo defines a mechanism to discover all possible
   data models (schema list retrieval) and a mechanism to retrieve
   schema via NETCONF (get schema).  Both can be performed dynamically
   throughout a session, unlike capabilities exchange which is performed
   during session setup only.  Both support multiple schema versions,
   formats and locations.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines NETCONF content via [XMLSchema] to be used to
   monitor the NETCONF protocol.  It provides information about NETCONF
   sessions and subscriptions.

1.1.  Definition of Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Element:  An [XML] Element.

   Operation:  This term is used to refer to NETCONF protocol
      operations.  Specifically within this document, operation refers
      to NETCONF protocol operations defined in support of NETCONF
      notifications.

   Schema:  This term is used to refer to a data model fragment,
      independent of which data modeling language is used in the data
      model.

   Subscription:  A concept related to the delivery of notifications (if
      any to send) involving destination and selection of notifications.
      It is bound to the lifetime of a session.

   XML Schema:  The W3C XML Schema [XMLSchema] data modeling language.

2.  XML Schema to Monitor NETCONF

   The following data is proposed to allow a NETCONF client to monitor
   both the NETCONF server itself and the associated network device
   operational data.  The specific data proposed in this memo and
   suggested usage:

2.1.  netconf


    netconf
     |_capabilities
     |_configurations
     |_schemas
     |_sessions
     |_subscriptions
     |_statistics

  capabilities (SimpleType:  xs:anyURI):
    List of NETCONF capabilities supported by the server.

  configurations (ComplexType:  ConfigurationDatastore):
    List of NETCONF datastores on the server.
    Includes all supported datastore types (running, candidate, startup)

  schemas (ComplexType:  SchemaEntry)
    List of schemas supported on the server.
    Includes all the information required to identify the schema and
    to support its retrieval.

  sessions (ComplexType:  ManagementSession):
    List of all active sessions on the device including NETCONF
    and other sessions (ie. CLI).

  subscriptions (ComplexType:  NetconfSubscription):
    List of all NETCONF notification subscriptions active on the server.

  statistics (ComplexType:  ManagementStatistics)
     Contains management stats for the NETCONF server
     including performance and error related counters.

2.1.1.  capabilities

   Minimally the same capabilities as exchanged during session setup
   such as those defined at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/netconf-capability-urns plus any
   vendor-specific capabilities.

Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2008


2.1.2.  configurations


  configurations:  NetconfDataStore complex data type.

  configuration
       |_name
       |_locks

  name:
     Enumeration of supported datastores; candidate, running, startup.

  locks (ComplexType:  ManagementSessionLock):
     Contains current lock information for the datastores.  Global and
     partial locks are supported as either a single global lock or
     multiple partial locks per datastore.

     Both a global lock and a partial lock will contain the sessionId
     and time the lock was acquired.  Additionally partial lock items
     will contain both the selection and the list of lockedNodes.  The
     selection is the xpath expression which was used to evaluate the
     list of nodes to lock.  The lockedNodes is the list of actual nodes
     which were locked at the the selection was evaluated.  This is
     provided for completeness noting that the list of nodes returned by
     the selection may differ over time.

2.1.3.  schemas

      |_namespace
      |_location

  The elements identifier, version, and format are used as a key in the
  schema list.  They are also used in the <get-schema> RPC.

  identifier:
    Identifier for the schema list entry.  Typically the module name or
    filename of the schema.  It is also used in the <get-schema>
    RPC and may be used for other means.

  version:
    Version of the schema supported.  Multiple versions can be supported
    simultaneously by a NETCONF server.  Each must be reported
    individually in the schema list, i.e. with same identifier, possibly
    different location, but different version.

  format:
    The data modeling language of the file/module.  Current selection of
    XSD, YANG, and RNG.

  namespace:
    The XML namespace defined by the data model.

  location:
    A location from which this specific schema, format, and version can
    be retrieved.  Can be either on the network device (eg: file system
    reference for ftp retrieval), retrievable explicitly via NETCONF
    (value: 'NETCONF') or some network location (eg: URL for http
    retrieval).

2.1.4.  sessions

   The total number of rpc requests received.

 inBadRpcs:
   The total number of rpcs which were parsed correctly, but couldn't
   be serviced because they contained non-conformant XML, e.g. missing a
   mandatory parameter.

 inNotSupportedRpcs:
   The total number of rpcs which were parsed correctly, but couldn't
   be serviced because they were not supported by the agent.

 outRpcReplies:
   The total number of <rpc-reply> messages sent.

3.  Schema Specific Operations

3.1.  New NETCONF RPC, <get-schema>

   When the schema is available on the device and the client wishes to
   have it returned via NETCONF this new RPC operation is used.

   Example: Query a specific schema on device using <get-schema>
   operation


   <rpc message-id="101"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <get-schema xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state">
       <identifier>foo</identifier>
       <version>v1</version>
       <format>XSD</format>
     </get-schema>
   </rpc>

   The NETCONF server returns the XML schema (XSD).

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <data><![CDATA[
       <xs:schema
         <!-- Contents of foo schema would be returned here -->
       </xs:schema>]]>
     </data>
   </rpc-reply>

   Schema list is supported via existing NETCONF <get> operation and is
   defined in the monitoring data model to facilitate retrieval.  This
   will support retrieval of the schema list specifically.  The details
   returned in the list will facilitate retrieval from a network
   location via a URL.  Additionally the ability to retrieve a schema
   via NETCONF will be supported.  In this case a new RPC operation is
   introduced to support this retrieval.

3.2.  NETCONF Schema List Retrieval (<get> monitoring data)

   A NETCONF client retrieves the list of supported XML Schema from a
   NETCONF server using the <get> RPC request.  The list of available
   XML Schema is retrieved by requesting the <schema> subtree via a
   <get> operation.  Available schema for the requesting session are
   returned in the reply containing the <identifier> ,<version> and
   <location> elements.  Since the same schema may be supported in
   multiple locations and/or have multiple versions and/or multiple

   formats no particular attribute is unique.  An empty reply is
   returned if there are no available schema.

   The response data can be used to determine the available schema and
   their versions.  The schema itself (ie. schema content) is not
   returned in the response.  Information about the schema is returned
   which is used to facilitate the retrieval of a particular format and
   version of the schema using a supported mechanism on the device such
   as ftp or http.  In addition when a schema is available on the device
   a special location value of 'NETCONF' is used to indicate its
   availability on the device.  Such schema can be retrieved via NETCONF
   using the <get-schema> RPC described later in this draft.

4.  Examples

4.1.  Retrieving schema list via <get>


   <rpc message-id="101"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">

       <filter type="subtree">
         <netconf xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state">
           <schemas/>
         </netconf>
       </filter>
     </get>
   </rpc>

   The NETCONF server returns a list of data models available for
   retrieval.

4.2.  Retrieving schema instances

   Given the reply in the previous section, the following examples
   illustrate the availability of 'foo', 'bar', and 'bar-types' schema
   at multiple locations, with multiple formats, and in multiple
   locations.

     1.  foo,  version 1.0 in XSD format:

       a.  Via FTP using location
           ftp://ftp.example.com/schemas/foo_1.0.xsd

       b.  Via HTTP using location
           http://www.example.com/schema/foo/1.0.xsd

       c.  Via <get-schema> using identifier, version, and
           format parameters.

       <rpc message-id="102"
            xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
         <get-schema xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state">
           <identifer>foo</identifer>
           <version>1.0</version>

     2. bar, version 2008-06-01 in YANG format:

       a.  Via HTTP using location
           http://example.com/schema/bar-2008-06-01.yang

       b.  Via <get-schema> using identifer, version, and
           format parameters:

           The domainName type represents a DNS domain
           name. The name SHOULD be fully qualified
           whenever possible.

           The description clause of objects using the
           domainName type MUST describe how (and when)
           these names are resolved to IP addresses.

           Note that the resolution of a domainName value
           may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g.,
           A for IPv4 and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the
           resolution process and which DNS record takes
           precedence depends on the configuration of the
           resolver.

6.  Security Considerations

   The information in this Schema provides information about NETCONF
   system that could be used to aid an attack on that system.  Care
   should be taken to restrict access to this information as
   appropriate.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the NETCONF working group for providing a much earlier
   draft of Schema to manage NETCONF and NETCONF Notifications that were
   cannibalized to produce this draft.
