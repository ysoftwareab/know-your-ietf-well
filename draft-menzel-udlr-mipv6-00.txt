Abstract 

   This document discusses mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 allowing the 
   efficient establishment of bidirectional link layer connectivity of 
   mobile receivers moving to access networks with unidirectional links.
   Scenarios are derived from the need to support seamless mobile
   in heterogeneous networking environment including unidirectional 
   downstream link interfaces, such as DVB-H, DVB-T, DVB-S or satellites.   
   In order to establish quickly the upstream connectivity of a mobile 
   receiver, when moving to downstream unidirectional network in MIPv6 
   environment, the Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanisms defined in 
   RFC 3077 are used in interaction with Mobile IPv6 protocols.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6            April 2006

   For the mobile receivers with interfaces to unidirectional downstream 
   links is required to have at least one additional interface, allowing 
   to provide the upstream connectivity over Internet.
   
   The information for the upstream link, called also "feed" in the 
   framework of RFC 3077, is included in the route advertisement message
   as an "unidirectional link tunneling" option.
   This option contains the IPv6 tunnel address for the upstream 
   connectivity of a mobile node  over the additional link. 
   The integration of the "unidirectional link tunneling" option  is also 
   proposed for Fast Handovers and Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD).

1. Overview 
    
   Mobile IPv6 does not attempt to solve all general problems related 
   to mobile nodes, as for instance when they have interfaces atached to 
   links with unidirectional connectivity [4]. 

   For the integration of technologies based on unidirectional links 
   (satellites, DVB-H, DVB-T [8]) into mobile IPv6 environment, there 
   is a need to define facilities for dynamic management of the 
   bidirectional connectivity of the mobile node, when the node 
   changes the access point to and/or moves to unidirectional access 
   network.  
   The Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanisms (LLTM) and the Dynamic 
   Tunneling Configuration Protocol (DTCP) described in RFC 3077 
   [1] are aimed to emulate bidirectional connectivity for 
   unidirectional links in Internet. LLTM was primary defined and used 
   based on scenarios mainly including IPv4 fixed multicast services 
   over unidirectional links, such as satellites [13]. 
   
   In the European project DAIDALOS [22], LLTM is used to support mobile

   receivers based on DVB-technologies for IPv6 environment. This is 
   based on integration of IPv6 services and protocols, such as PIM-SM 
   routing [18], [19],and Multicast Listening Discovery (MLDv2) [17]),
   in mobile Internet environment considering the specifics of 
   unidirectional links. 

   In order to support efficently bidirectional connectivity of mobile 
   nodes with unidirectional links in IPv6, this document proposes an 
   OPTIONAL facility extending IPv6 mobility protocol [4] and 
   its complementary protocols for Fast Handovers [15] and CARD [6]
   considering interoperation with LLTM [1]. 
   
   The proposed facility allows dynamically bidirectional connectivity 
   using LLTM and is RECOMMENDED for efficient support of IPv6 mobile 
   nodes with unidirectional links during their movement from one 
   access network to another. 

   This document discusses the usage of LLTM for MIPv6 and defines the 
   operational considerations for the integration of the option for 
   unidirectional link handling in MIPv6, Fast Handovers and CARD.

      at least multiple CoAs.

    
3. Scenarios using mobile receivers connected to unidirectional links

   Unidirectional networks, based on satellites, DVB-T and DVB-H, could 
   be part of different scenarios for media content distribution to 
   multiple receivers and deploying of large scale multicast with saving 
   of bandwidth and administration costs. 
   In order to benefit from a better coverage area, costs and 
   the characteristics of the satellite and broadcast technology, the 
   unidirectional links are often used in heterogeneous wired and 
   wireless environment.
   Such scenarios are typically based on asymmetric communication.
   An example is described in [11], in which multicasting of cache   
   objects is performed on a high bandwidth downstream unidirectional 
   satellite links, while the acknowledgments and requests from the 
   receivers are transferred on an additional low bandwidth link over 
   Internet.     
   Satellites as unidirectional link could be efficiently used to 
   deliver multicast traffic to a large number of listeners located
   in different geographic areas [16]. In this case, downstream 
   shortcuts from multicast sources to multicast listeners are created, 
   where upstream different wireless technologies could be used to 
   provide connectivity over Internet to the sending source. 
   In the heterogeneous mobile networking environment of Mobile IPv6 
   [4], the receivers with unidirectional downstream links are
   connected upstream using additional wireless access technologies.

   When the mobile receivers with unidirectional links move, there are
   different kinds of handover related to the unidirectional links, which 
   should be seamlessly performed:

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6 	       April 2006



   - handover to another unidirectional access link for downstream 
     transfer, which requires establishment of new upstream tunnel over 
     the additional wireless access network and release of already 
     exiting tunnel;
   - handover to a wireless access network with release of already 
     existing upstream tunnel;
   - handover to a new upstream tunnel over the additional wireless 
     access network and establishment of new upstream channel and 
     release of already exiting;
    
   Mobile IPv6 is designed to allow a mobile node to maintain
   its IPv6 communications while moving between IPv6 subnets. 
   However, the current specification of Mobile IPv6 lacks support for 
   mobile nodes with unidirictional links using additional wireless 
   access network for upstream communication. 
   In case of unidirectional links, different IP addresses (CoAs) should 
   be assigned to the mobile node to the downstream (unidirectional) and 
   upstream link allowing the bidirectional connectivity.
   For this purpose multihoming of the mobile node with unidirectional
   link in MIPv6 is required, which is currently under standardisation 
   [7], [28], [29].

  
4. Requirements of mobile nodes with unidirectional links 
    
   Emulation of bidirectional connectivity for mobile nodes with 
   unidirectional links is required to support mobile IPv6 services. 
   Bidirectional connectivity is needed for address configuration in 
   MIPv6 based on Neighbor discovery [23], dynamic stateless [24] and 
   stateful [25] mechanisms. Multicast protocols, particularly used for
   integration of DVB-T in IPv6 mobile environment, such as PIM-SM [18],
   [19] and multicast listening based on MLDv2 [17], require
   bidirectional links for their protocol messages. 

   For dynamically establishment of bidirectional connectivity based 
   on unidirectional links, dynamic LLTM protocol [1] was proposed, 
   which is adding a layer between the network interface and the routing 
   software to emulate the full bidirectional connectivity using Internet 
   tunnels. The focus of the UniDirectional Link Routing (UDLR) Working
   group was to integrate LLTM to support Internet routing and multicast 
   services on UDLs such as satellites. 

   Application of LLTM in different scenarios was studied. 
   Experiments with IGMP protocol in Ipv4 environment using LLTM are 
   reported in [14]. Configuration issues of the multicast routing 
   protocol DVMRP for UDLs based on LLTM are addressed in [12]. 
   Usage of LLTM to support Ipv4 multicast receivers connected over
   UDLs to IPv6 infrastructures is described in [13].

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6 	       April 2006


   This document extends the current state-of-the art of LLTM usage 
   for mobile nodes with unidirectional links adapting the LLTM 
   mechanisms to the mobile IPv6 requirements. The usage of LLTM in 
   MIPv6 environment, when the mobile node moves, depends on the 
   possibility of establishment of Internet based connections for the 
   tunnels emulating the bidirectional links. 

   Figure 1 describes a scenario based on mobile nodes with UDLs 
   in IPv6 mobile environment using Access Routers acting as "feeds" 
   and mobile nodes as "receivers" considering the LLTM terminology.

   Figure 1: UDL topology based on "receiver" mobile nodes and feed AR 

   An example for a mobile node with "receive only" capable 
   unidirectional link in MIPv6 is the mobile terminal with DVB-T 
   reception antenna supporting Digital Video Broadcasting. 
   In this scenario, mobile nodes with "receive-only" capable UDLs are 
   considered, which MUST be in addition equipped with other 
   wireless links providing bidirectional connectivity such as UMTS, 
   WLAN (IEEE 802.11x), or IEEE 802.16-2004 promoted by the WiMAX Forum. 

   The equipment of the mobile node with additional bidirectional wireless 
   links is required for emulation of bidirectional connectivity using LLTM. 

   Before the handover, the mobile node was attached to an access point with
   unidirectional link (UDL_pAP) using the previous AR acting as Feed 
   (pAR_Feed). After the handover, the mobile node moves its attachment to 
   the next access point (UDL_nAP) using the nAR acting as Feed (nAR_Feed).

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6 	       April 2006


   During the movement, it is a need to establish the bidirectional 
   connectivity to the next AR Feed (nAR_Feed) using the additional 
   bidirectional wireless link of the mobile node. 

   The handover due to a new access point for the UDL is independent on the
   handover to a nAR connected to the bidirectional wireless links. 

   The usage of LLTM requires a guarantee that the mobile node is connected 
   over the additional bidirectional wireless link to the Internet and there 
   is a route available to the AR Feed connecting the node with UDL. 

   The routing and management requirements for the additional BDL interface 
   are not focus of this document. The particular goal of this document is 
   to define mechanisms in Mobile IPv6, which allow to provide efficient 
   handover based on learning of the next Care-of address for the UDL 
   interface together with the feed information to provide BDL connectivity. 

   Currently in the mobile IPv6 [4], the configuration of a new Care-of 
   address for the mobile node is defined based on the Neighbor Discovery 
   [23], stateless [24] and stateful [25] configuration, but
   the particular issues of configuration of care-of addresses for mobile 
   nodes with UDL is still not considered. It requires not only to obtain 
   information for the next Care-of Address of the UDL interface, but also 
   to get simultaneously the feed endpoints established at the next AR for
   emulation of bidirectional connectivity. 

   Further requirements are to support the same tunneling protocol and link
   layer addressing schemes at the mobile node and access router feed. 
   For this purpose the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [2] with
   Ipv6 as delivery protocol could be used. Interoperable link layer 
   addressing for the BDL emulation should be also guaranteed. 
   As it is shown in figure 2, the LLTM packet using GRE for encapsulation 
   and IPv6 as delivery protocol has the following format:

            +-------------------------------------------+
            | Delivery Header (IPv6 header)             |
            | dest address = feed_IP_addr               |
            | next header = 47 (GRE)                    |

            |       GRE Header (                        |

            |          . . . . . . )                    |

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6 	       April 2006


  The destination address of the Ipv6 header is the feed tunnel end 
   point at the AR. The "next header" field of the IPv6 header is 47, 
   pointing on the IP protocol number of the GRE protocol described by 
   the following header [0]. The prototype field of GRE header 
   shows the type of the emulated BDL [21], which SHOULD be supported
   by the mobile nodes and feed ARs.

   In mobile environment, there are always requirements to reduce the 
   overhead of the mobile nodes. Therefore, the sending intervals of 
   the "HELLO" messages for announcing tunnel end-points as defined in 
   Dynamic Tunneling Configuration Protocol (DTCP) should be adapted 
   for the mobile environment. 

   In order to establish bidirectional connectivity network between the
  "feed" and "receivers", there is a need to advertise the "feed" 
   information of the new access router 
   (currently sent by "HELLO" message) during 
   the handover processing using IPv6 Mobility protocols. 
   This should accelerate the services concerning dynamic address 
   configuration of mobile nodes with UDLs during the handover. 
   In particular, this document proposes to learn the AR feeds more quickly 
   based on extensions of mobile IPv6 packets with a new option for handling
   of UDLs, which contains information derived from the "HELLO" message. 

   The cause is that based on the "HELLO" messages the learning of the
   "feeds" of the mobile node with unidirectional links during the 
   handover is delayed after its attachment on the new links and that is an
   unacceptable delay for the configuration of mobile node's 
   Care-of address in IPv6.

   In summary, the requirements for handling of mobile nodes with UDLs
   using LLTM in MIPv6 are:
   -  Support of mobile nodes with unidirectional links during 
      handover for quickly care-of address configuration based on feed 
      information provided by the access routers.
   -  Adapting DTCP parameter for mobile environment based on reducing 
      the overhead to the mobile nodes.
   -  Supporting of interoperable tunneling protocol type (GRE with 
      IPv6 as delivery protocol is recommended) and link layer 
      addressing scheme for bidirectional link emulation.
   -  Management of mobile access router connectivity in order to 
      guarantee the connections using the additional bidirectional 
      wireless links to the feed ARs.

   Further requirements for unidirectional link handling could arise 
   considering specific scenarios, as for instance multicast feedback 
   implosion problem, but they are out of scope.

5. Integration of unidirectional link tunneling information in IPv6 mobility 
   protocols
    
   This document proposes the Unidirectional Link tunneling information, 
   which is RECOMMENDED to enhance the Mobile IPv6 messages defined in 
   MIPv6 [4], Fast Handovers [15] and CARD protocol [6] in order to 
   establish dynamically the bidirectional connectivity of a mobile node with interfaces 
   to unidirectional links. 
   This option is used to get the IPv6 address for the "feeds" of the  
   a access router providing the upstream connectivity of the mobile node
   with the  unidirectional link.  
   There are different alternatives to include the option in IPv6 Mobility 
   protocols:  

   -  Router Advertisement Message used in Mobile IPv6 [4]
   -  Proxy Router Advertisement Message defined in Fast Handovers 
      for MIPv6 [15]
   -  Reply message of the CARD [6].

   The Unidirectional Link Handling option is described by:


    	 0                   1                   2                   3

	 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
   
   -  Option Type -  To be defined by IANA.

   -  Option Length (8-bit unsigned integer) - representing the length 
      in octets of the Feed Information (FeedInfo). 
      The Feed Info includes for each Access Point Identifier the 
      established feed tunnel end-points at the access router. 
      It is defined by following descriptions:

	o UdlAP  (48 Bit) Access Point Identifier identifying the 
          IEEE MAC address of layer 2 device offering the 
          unidirectional connectivity
	o FU_IP (128 bit) L3 (IPv6) address of the "feed" AR to the 
          unidirectional link 
	o FU_L2 (48 bit)  L2 (MAC) address corresponding to FU_IP as 
          agreed for the bidirectional emulation of the particular 
          link.

	o Tunnel type (8 bit unsigned integer) defined by the 
          tunneling protocol   type assigned by IANA [20]. 
          Recommended is GRE [2]. Obtaining new values for 
          tunnelling protocols is documented in [3].
        o F (1 bit) - Indicates the type of feed (send-only, receive-
          only)
	o NmbFeedInfo (4 bit unsigned integer) - Number of feed 
	  information tuples.
	o ListFeedInfo List of feed information tuples. Each tuple 
	  includes:  
	     - IPv6 address (128 bit) of feed tunnel end-point 
             - L2 (MAC) address (48 bit) of the feed tunnel end point 
               as agreed for the bidirectional emulation of 
               the particular link.

6. Operational considerations

   The information for unidirectional link tunneling in Mobile IPv6  
   is used at the mobile receivers connected to the unidirectional links 
   to obtain dynamically the upstream  tunneling information for 
   establishment of bidirectional connectivity. 
   The mobile receiver could get this information based on mechanisms 
   provided of Mobile IP6, Fast Handovers for MIPv6 or CARD protocol. 
    
6.1 Mobility support for Ipv6
    
   The unidirectional link handling option in the framework of MIPv6 
   [4] COULD be integrated in the "Options" Part of the Router 
   Advertisement Message [23] specified for MIPv6 [4]. 
   This allows before the configuration of a new on-link care-of-
   address of the mobile node based on the prefix included in the 
   Router Advertisement also to establish the tunnel endpoints to the 
   feed for bidirectional communication using the unidirectional links.
 
   In Mobile IPv6 routers advertise their presence using Router 
   Advertisement Messages either periodically (unsolicited) or in 
   response to Router Solicitation message sent by the Mobile Node. 
   MIPv6 specifies the requirements for sending of unsolicited Router 
   Advertisement in Mobile IP  [4].

   When a mobile node attaches to a new "receive-only" unidirectional 
   link at the first time, it cannot send Router Solicitation messages 
   as proposed in [23] to locate default routers and learn 
   prefixes more quickly. 

   It SHOULD first receive an unsolicited Router Advertisement Message 
   with Option for unidirectional link Handling.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6 	       April 2006


   In order to provide timely movement of mobile nodes with 
   UDLs, the "routers supporting mobility SHOULD be able to be configured
   with a smaller MinRtrAdvInterval value and MaxRtrAdvInterval value to
   allow sending of Unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements more often"
   as this is generally required in [4]. 

   After establishment of tunnel end-point for bidirectional connectivity,
   the mobile node can configure its care-of address based on: 

   -  Stateless Address Configuration [24], and/or 
   -  Stateful Address Configuration using Dynamic Host Configuration 
      [25]. 

   When the new connection is established, the mobile node can send Router
   Solicitations for specific events described in [23], such as 
   temporary loss of connection.

6.2 Fast Handovers for Ipv6
    
   IPv6 Fast Handovers has been proposed in the Internet Draft [15]
   in order to minimize the interruption in services experienced by a Mobile
   IPv6 node as it changes its point of attachment to the Internet. 

   IPv6 Fast handover is complementary to IPv6, therefore the technique
   to include Unidirectional Link Handling Option in Router Advertisement
   will be also used in the Fast Handovers protocol. 
  
   IPv6 Fast Handovers protocol integrates two strategies for mobile node
   movement called predictive and reactive handover. They are based on the
   same procedures using the Proxy Router Advertisement Message to advertise
   the next AR information for configuration of the new Care-of address for 
   the mobile node. It is sent from the previous AR to the mobile node to
   supply next access router information (AR-Info) about new access points.

   In the framework of IPv6 Fast Handovers, the UDL handling option COULD
   be included in the "option" part of the Proxy Router Advertisement
   Message (PrRtAdv). In case that the node moves to a next AR, the UDL 
   handling option will supply the feed information of the next AR for
   bidirectional connectivity establishment.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6 	       April 2006


   IPv6 Fast Handovers begins when a MN sends RtSolPr to its current 
   access router to resolve one or more Access Point Identifiers (AP-
   IDs) to subnet-specific information. 

   In response, the access router sends a PrRtAdv message, which contains
   one or more [AP-ID, AR-Info] tuples. The PrRtAdv message SHOULD include
   the UDL handling option with AR-FeedInfo for requested Access Points 
   (AP-IDs), which are based on unidirectional connectivity. 
   The new AR-FeedInfo is used to update the mobile node information for 
   BDL emulation. With the AR-Info information included in the PrRTAdv 
   message, the mobile node formulates a prospective next Care-of address
   establishing the tunnel end-points for its BDL emulation.
   Performing this, it sends: 

   -  Fast Binding Update message to the previous AR in the case of 
      "Predictive" Fast Handover.

   -  Fast Binding Update message to the next AR in the case of 
      "Reactive" Fast Handover.

   In case that the mobile node does not receive AR-FeedInfo for BDL
   emulation, it does not perform the binding update.
 
   The specific steps for handling of movement of mobile nodes with 
   UDLs in Fast Handovers MIPv6 are shown in figure 4:

6.3 UDL handling with CARD protocol
    
   The Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol was designed 
   to support the acquisition of information about the possible next ARs
   that are candidates for the mobile node's handover [6]. 
  
   This document proposes to use CARD to report UDL feed information,
   when selecting a next router with UDLs.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6 	       April 2006


   CARD protocol is used in EU project DAIDALOS [22] together 
   with the Context Transfer protocol [5] and IPv6 Fast Handovers
   [15] for efficient handover aimed at optimization of service
   re-establishment in case of MIPv6 node handover.

   The UDL handling option is included as sub-option in the CARD
   Reply Signalling message exchanged between access routers and mobile 
   nodes, in order to provide the feedback information to the mobile node,
   arriving at the access network with unidirectional link.  

   The signalling messages using CARD protocol for reporting of unidirectional
   link informations are shown in figure 5:

7. IANA considerations
    
   IANA should record a value for Unidirectional Link Handling Option 
   (Mobile IPv6 Option).
    
8. Further work 
 
   The integration of unidirectional link handling in mobile IPv6
   is important for efficient handover using technologies based on 
   DVB-T and satellites to connect mobile users. 

   Facilities for handling of unidirectional links in IPv6 based on 
   LLTM [1] with extensions for IPv6 mobility are proposed. 
   LLTM with GRE support [2] is implemented in DAIDALOS EU project 
   for mobile Ipv6 heterogeneous networking environment in 
   interaction with Mobile IPv6, Fast Handovers IPv6 and CARD Protocol.

   The scenarios for LLTM usage in DAIDALOS are based on DVB-T with 
   access routers acting as feeds and mobile nodes as receivers.  
   Other issues such as security and routing implications in case of 
   unidirectional links are topic of further work.
