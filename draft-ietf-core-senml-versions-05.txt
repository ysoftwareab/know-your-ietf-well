1.  Introduction

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) specification [RFC8428] provides
   a version number that is initially set to 10, without further
   specification on the way to make use of different version numbers.

   The traditional idea of using a version number to indicate the
   evolution of an interchange format generally assumes an incremental
   progression of the version number as the format accretes additional
   features over time.  However, in the case of SenML, it is expected
   that the likely evolution will be for independently selectable
   capability _features_ to be added to the basic specification that is
   indicated by version number 10.  To support this model, this document
   repurposes the single version number accompanying a pack of SenML
   records so that it is interpreted as a bitmap that indicates the set
   of features a recipient would need to have implemented to be able to
   process the pack.

   This short document specifies the use of SenML Features and maps them
   to SenML version number space, updating [RFC8428].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses the notation
   familiar from the programming language C [C], including the "0b"
   prefix for binary numbers defined in Section 5.13.2 of the C++
   language standard [Cplusplus], except that superscript notation
   (example for two to the power of 64: 2^64) denotes exponentiation; in
   the plain text version of this draft, superscript notation is
   rendered in paragraph text by C-incompatible surrogate notation as
   seen in this example, and in display math by a crude plaintext
   representation, as is the sum (Sigma) sign.

2.  Feature Codes and the Version number

   The present specification defines "SenML Features", each identified
   by a "feature name" (a text string) and a "feature code" (an unsigned
   integer less than 53).

   The specific version of a SenML pack is composed of a set of
   features.  The SenML version number ("bver" field) is then a bitmap
   of these features represented as an unsigned integer, specifically
   the sum of, for each feature present, two taken to the power of the
   feature code of that feature (Figure 1).

              __ 52                   fc
   version = \         present(fc) ⋅ 2
             /__ fc = 0

             Figure 1: Feature bitmap as a sum of feature bits

   where present(fc) is 1 if the feature with the feature code "fc" is
   present, 0 otherwise.  (The expression 2^fc can be implemented as "1
   << fc" in C and related languages.)

   RFC editor: Please check that, in the TXT version, no "&nbsp;" crept
   into the above due to xml2rfc bug 641, and remove this paragraph.  If
   possible with today's RFCXML, add the Sigma character as a
   parenthesis after "sum" in the caption.

2.1.  Discussion

   Representing features as a bitmap within a number is quite efficient
   as long as feature codes are sparingly allocated (see also
   Section 6).

   Compatibility with the existing SenML version number, 10 decimal
   (0b1010), requires reserving four of the least significant bit
   positions for the base version as described in Section 3.  There is
   an upper limit to the range of the integer numbers that can be
   represented in all SenML representations: practical JSON limits this
   to 2^53-1 [RFC7493].  This means the feature codes 4 to 52 are
   available, one of which is taken by the feature defined in Section 4,
   leaving 48 for allocation.  (The current version 10 (with all other
   feature codes unset) can be visualized as
   "0b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001010".)  For a
   lifetime of this scheme of several decades, approximately two feature
   codes per year or fewer should be allocated.  Note that less
   generally applicable features can always be communicated via fields
   labeled with names that end with the "_" character ("must-understand
   fields"), see Section 4.4 of [RFC8428].)

   Most representations visible to engineers working with SenML will use
   decimal numbers, e.g., 26 (0b11010, 0x1a) for a version that adds the
   "Secondary Units" feature (Section 4).  This is slightly unwieldy,
   but will be quickly memorized in practice.

   As a general observation, ending up over time with dozens of
   individually selectable optional extensions may lead to too many
   variants of what is supported by different implementations, reducing
   interoperability.  So, in practice, it is still desirable to batch up
   extensions that are expected to be supported together into a single
   feature bit, leading to a sort of hybrid between completely
   independent extensions and a linear version scheme.  This is also
   another reason why a space of 48 remaining feature codes should
   suffice for a while.

2.2.  Updating Section 4.4 of [RFC8428]

   The last paragraph of Section 4.4 of [RFC8428] may be read to give
   the impression that SenML version numbers are totally ordered, i.e.,
   that an implementation that understands version n also always
   understands all versions k < n.  If this ever was true for SenML
   versions before 10, it certainly is no longer true with this
   specification.

Internet-Draft         SenML Features and Versions             June 2021


   Any SenML pack that sets feature bits beyond the first four will lead
   to a version number that actually is greater than 10, so the
   requirement in Section 4.4 of [RFC8428] will prevent false
   interoperability with version 10 implementations.

   Implementations that do implement feature bits beyond the first four,
   i.e., versions greater than 10, will instead need to perform a
   bitwise comparison of the feature bitmap as described in this
   specification and ensure that all features indicated are understood
   before using the pack.  E.g., an implementation that implements basic
   SenML (version number 10) plus only a future feature code 5, will
   accept version number 42, but would not be able to work with a pack
   indicating version number 26 (base specification plus feature code
   4).  (If the implementation _requires_ feature code 5 without being
   backwards compatible, it will accept 42, but not 10.)

3.  Features: Reserved0, Reserved1, Reserved2, Reserved3

   For SenML Version 10 as described in [RFC8428], the feature codes 0
   to 3 are already in use.  Reserved1 (1) and Reserved3 (3) are always
   present and the features Reserved0 (0) and Reserved2 (2) are always
   absent, i.e., the four least significant bits set to 0b1010 indicate
   a version number of 10 if no other feature is in use.  These four
   reserved feature codes are not to be used with any more specific
   semantics except in a specification that updates the present
   specification.  (Note that Reserved0 and Reserved2 could be used in
   such a specification in a similar way to the way the feature codes 4
   to 52 are in the present specification.)

4.  Feature: Secondary Units

   The feature "Secondary Units" (code number 4) indicates that
   secondary unit names [RFC8798] MAY be used in the "u" field of SenML
   Records, in addition to the primary unit names already allowed by
   [RFC8428].

   Note that the most basic use of this feature simply sets the SenML
   version number to 26 (10 + 2^4).

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8428] apply.  This specification
   provides structure to the interpretation of the SenML version number,
   which poses no additional security considerations except for some
   potential for surprise that version numbers do not simply increase
   linearly.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new subregistry "SenML features" within
   the SenML registry [IANA.senml], with the registration policy
   "specification required" [RFC8126] and the columns:

   *  Feature code (an unsigned integer less than 53)

   *  Feature name (text)

   *  Specification

   To facilitate the use of feature names in programs, the designated
   expert is requested to ensure that feature names are usable as
   identifiers in most programming languages, after lower-casing the
   feature name in the registry entry and replacing whitespace with
   underscores or hyphens, and that they also are distinct in this form.

   The initial content of this registry is as follows:

          +==============+=================+====================+
          | Feature code | Feature name    | Specification      |
          +==============+=================+====================+
          | 0            | Reserved0       | RFCthis            |
          +--------------+-----------------+--------------------+
          | 1            | Reserved1       | RFCthis            |
          +--------------+-----------------+--------------------+
          | 2            | Reserved2       | RFCthis            |
          +--------------+-----------------+--------------------+
          | 3            | Reserved3       | RFCthis            |
          +--------------+-----------------+--------------------+
          | 4            | Secondary Units | RFCthis, [RFC8798] |
          +--------------+-----------------+--------------------+

             Table 1: Features defined for SenML at the time of
                                  writing

   As the number of features that can be registered has a hard limit (48
   codes left at the time of writing), the designated expert is
   specifically instructed to maintain a frugal regime of code point
   allocation, keeping code points available for SenML Features that are
   likely to be useful for non-trivial subsets of the SenML ecosystem.
   Quantitatively, the expert could for instance steer the allocation to
   a target of not allocating more than 10 % of the remaining set per
   year.

   Where the specification of the feature code is provided in a document
   that is separate from the specification of the feature itself (as
   with feature code 4 above), both specifications should be listed.
