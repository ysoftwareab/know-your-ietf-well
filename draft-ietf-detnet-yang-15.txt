              Deterministic Networking (DetNet) YANG Model
                       draft-ietf-detnet-yang-15

Abstract

   This document contains the specification for the Deterministic
   Networking YANG Model for configuration and operational data for
   DetNet Flows.  The model allows for provisioning of end-to-end DetNet
   service on devices along the path without dependency on any signaling
   protocol.  It also specifies operational status for flows.  An
   operator or network controller programs the configuration of the
   devices.

   The YANG module defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   DetNet (Deterministic Networking) provides a capability to carry
   specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
   with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
   delivery latency.  A description of the general background and
   concepts of DetNet can be found in [RFC8655].

   This document defines a YANG model for DetNet based on YANG data
   types and modeling language defined in [RFC6991] and [RFC7950].
   DetNet service, which is designed for describing the characteristics
   of services being provided for application flows over a network, and
   DetNet configuration, which is designed for DetNet flow path
   establishment, flow status reporting, and DetNet functions
   configuration in order to achieve end-to-end bounded latency and zero
   congestion loss, are both included in this document.

2.  Abbreviations

   The following abbreviations are used in this document:

   PEF           Packet Elimination Function

   PRF           Packet Replication Function

   MPLS          Multiprotocol Label Switching

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC8655].

4.  DetNet YANG Module

   The DetNet YANG module includes DetNet App-flow, DetNet Service Sub-
   layer, and DetNet Forwarding Sub-layer configuration and operational
   objects.  The corresponding attributes used in different sub-layers
   are defined in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 respectively.

   Layers of the objects typically occur in the different data instances
   forming the node types defined in [RFC8655].  Figure 1 illustrates
   the relationship between data instance node types and the included
   layers.  Node types typically are logical per DetNet service and one
   DetNet service can be one node type while another is another node
   type on same device.  This model is a controller based model because
   a controller or operator configures all the devices to form a
   service.


         +---------------------------------------------------+
         |                    Instance                       |
   +-----+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+
   |     |Edge Node        |   Relay Node    | Transit Node  |
   +-----+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+
   |  L  |Application      |                 |               |
   |  a  +-----------------+-----------------+---------------+
   |  y  |Service Sub-Layer|Service Sub-Layer|               |
   |  e  +-----------------+-----------------+---------------+
   |  r  |Forwarding S-L   |Forwarding S-L   | Forwarding S-L|
   +-----+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+

                   Figure 1: Detnet Layers and Node Types

   All of the layers have ingress/incoming and egress/outgoing
   operations but any instance may be configured as only unidirectional.
   This means that each unidirectional flow identifier configuration is
   programmed starting at the ingress and flow status is reported at
   ingress on each end.  In the MPLS cases once encapsulated, the IP six
   tuple parameters may not be required to be programmed again.  In the
   IP case, without encapsulation, various IP flow id parameters must be
   configured along the flow path.

   In the YANG model the terms source and destination are used as flow
   identifiers whereas ingress and egress refer to a DetNet application
   direction from the application edge.  Ingress is to the DetNet
   application and egress is from the application.  The terms incoming
   and outgoing generally represent the flow direction towards the
   remote application.  Outgoing is viewed as going up the stack from
   Application to Service sub-layer to Forwarding sub-layer and incoming
   is the reverse.  Although, in examples where there is aggregation and
   disaggregation outgoing relates to the aggregating output and
   incoming relates to the disaggregating flows.

   At the egress the YANG model is handing off IP or MPLS to a next hop
   and a routing next hop structure is used.

4.1.  DetNet Application Flow YANG Attributes

   DetNet application flow is responsible for mapping between
   application flows and DetNet flows at the edge node(egress/ingress
   node).  The application flows can be either layer 2 or layer 3 flows.
   To map a flow at the User Network Interface (UNI), the corresponding
   attributes are defined in [RFC9016].

4.2.  DetNet Service Sub-layer YANG Attributes

   DetNet service functions, e.g., DetNet tunnel initialization/
   termination and service protection, are provided in the DetNet
   service sub-layer.  To support these functions, the following service
   attributes need to be configured:

   *  DetNet flow identification

   *  Service function indication, indicates which service function will
      be invoked at a DetNet edge, relay node or end station.  (DetNet
      tunnel initialization or termination are default functions in
      DetNet service layer, so there is no need for explicit
      indication).  The corresponding arguments for service functions
      also needs to be defined.

4.3.  DetNet Forwarding Sub-layer YANG Attributes

   As defined in [RFC8655], DetNet forwarding sub-layer optionally
   provides congestion protection for DetNet flows over paths provided
   by the underlying network.  Explicit route is another mechanism that
   is used by DetNet to avoid temporary interruptions caused by the
   convergence of routing or bridging protocols, and it is also
   implemented at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.

   To support congestion protection and explicit route, the following
   transport layer related attributes are necessary:

   *  Flow Specification and Traffic Requirements, refers to [RFC9016].
      These may used for resource reservation, flow shaping, filtering
      and policing by a control plane or other network management and
      control mechanisms.

   *  Since this model programs the data plane existing explicit route
      mechanisms can be reused.  If a static MPLS tunnel is used as the
      transport tunnel, the configuration need to be at every transit
      node along the path.  For an IP based path, the static
      configuration is similar to the static MPLS case.  This document
      provides data-plane configuration of IP addresses or MPLS labels
      but it does not provide control plane mapping or other aspects.

5.  DetNet Flow Aggregation

   DetNet provides the capability of flow aggregation to improve
   scalability of DetNet data, management and control planes.
   Aggregated flows can be viewed by the some DetNet nodes as individual
   DetNet flows.  When aggregating DetNet flows, the flows should be
   compatible: if bandwidth reservations are used, the reservation
   should be a reasonable representation of the individual reservations;
   if maximum delay bounds are used, the system should ensure that the
   aggregate does not exceed the delay bounds of the individual flows.

   The DetNet YANG model defined in this document supports DetNet flow
   aggregation with the following functions:

   *  Aggregation flow encapsulation/decapsulation/identification

   *  Mapping individual DetNet flows to an aggregated flow

   *  Changing traffic specification parameters for aggregated flow

   The following cases of DetNet aggregation are supported:

   *  Ingress node aggregates App flows into a service sub-layer of
      DetNet flow

   *  In ingress node, the service sub-layers of DetNet flows are
      aggregated into a forwarding sub-layer

   *  In ingress node, the service sub-layers of DetNet flows are
      aggregated into a service sub-layer of an aggregated DetNet flow

   *  Relay node aggregates the forwarding sub-layers DetNet flows into
      a forwarding sub-layer

   *  Relay node aggregates the service sub-layers of DetNet flows into
      a forwarding sub-layer

   *  Relay node aggregates the service sub-layers of DetNet flows into
      a service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet flow

   *  Relay node aggregates the forwarding sub-layers of DetNet flow
      into a service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet flow

   *  Transit node aggregates the forwarding sub-layers of DetNet flows
      into a forwarding sub-layer

   Traffic requirements and traffic specification may be tracked for
   individual or aggregate flows but reserving resources and tracking
   the services in the aggregated flow is out of scope.

6.  DetNet YANG Structure Considerations


   The picture shows that the general structure of the DetNet YANG
   Model:


                     +-----------+
                     |ietf-detnet|
                     +-----+-----+
                           |
            +--------------+----------------+------------------+
            |              |                |                  |
      +-----+------+ +-----+------+ +-------+------+           |
      | App Flows  | |service s-l | |forwarding s-l|           |
      +-----+------+ +-----+------+ +-------+------+           |
            |              |                |                  |
      +-----+------+ +-----+------+ +-------+------+           |
      | Reference  | | Reference  | | Reference    |           |
      | to Traffic | | to Traffic | | to Traffic   |   +-------+-------+
      | Profile    | | Profile    | | Profile      |   |Traffic Profile|
      +------------+ +------------+ +--------------+   +---------------+

   There are three layer types in DetNet YANG Model: App-flow data
   layer, service sub-layer and forwarding sub-layer.  Additionally, the
   Traffic parameters are captured in a Traffic profile that can be
   referenced by any of the layers.

   Below is a a summary YANG tree showing the major items.  A complete
   YANG tree is in section Appendix A.

   A traffic profile can be created for application, service sub-layer
   or forwarding sub-layer.  A single profile may be shared by multiple
   applications/sub-layer.  Each profile indicates the members that
   currently are using a profile.

   Depending on which DetNet layers and functions are required, some or
   all of the components may configured.  Examples are shown in
   Appendix B.

10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for DetNet are covered in the DetNet
   Archtiecture [RFC8655] and DetNet Security Considerations [RFC9055] .

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols,
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can break or
   incorrectly connect DetNet flows.  Since this is a configured Data
   Plane any changes that are not coordinated with all devices along the
   path the whole DetNet module is considered vulnerable and should have
   authorized access only.

   Similarly, the data nodes in these YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   node and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /detnet/app-flows: This controls the application details so it could
   be considered sensitive.

   /detnet/traffic-profile/member-app: This links traffic profiles to
   applications, o this also coudl be considered moer sensitive.  The
   trafic profiles liked to service sub-layer and forwarding sub-layer
   are less sensitive.

   /detnet/service/sub-layer/incoming/app-flow: This links applications
   to services.

   /detnet/service/sub-layer/outgoing/app-flow: This links applications
   to services.

Appendix B.  Examples

   The following examples are provided.  These examples are tested with
   Yanglint and use operational output to exercise both config true and
   config false objects.  Note that IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
   supported but for clarity in the examples and diagrams IPv4 has been
   used in most examples.  The IP types are imported from [RFC6991] and
   these support both IPv4 and IPv6.

   The following are examples of aggregation and disaggregation at
   various points in Detnet.  Figures are provided in the PDF version of
   this document.

B.1.  Example A-1 JSON Configuration/Operational

   This illustrates simple aggregation.  Ingress node 1 aggregates App
   flows 0 and 1 into a service sub-layer of DetNet flow 1.  Two ways of
   illustrating this follow, then the JSON operational data model
   corresponding to the diagrams follows.  This example uses IPv6
   address format.

   Please consult the PDF or HTML versions for the Case A-1 Diagram.

B.2.  Example B-1 XML Config: Aggregation using a Forwarding Sub-layer

   This illustrates aggrgation in the service sub-layers of DetNet.
   Flows 1 and 2 are aggregated into a forwarding sub-layer.  A diagram
   illustrating this case is shown and then the corresponding XML
   operational data follows.

               Figure 6: Example B-1 DetNet XML configuration

B.3.  Example B-2 JSON Service Aggregation Configuration

   This illustrates the service sub-layers of DetNet.  Flows 1 and 2 are
   aggregated into a service sub-layer of aggregated DetNet flow 1.  A
   diagram illustrating this case is shown and then the corresponding
   JSON operational data follows.

   Please consult the PDF or HTML versions for the Case B-2 Diagram.

           Figure 8: Example B-2 DetNet JSON Service Aggregation

B.4.  Example C-1 JSON Relay Aggregation/Disaggregation Configuration

   This illustrates the Relay node 1 aggregating the forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flows 1 and 2 into a forwarding sub-layer.  A
   diagram illustrating both aggregation and disaggregation is shown and
   then the corresponding JSON operational data follows.

   Please consult the PDF or HTML versions for the Case C-1 Diagram.

                                 Sub-Layer

B.6.  Example C-3 JSON Relay Service Sub-Layer Aggregation/
      Disaggregation

   This illustrates the Relay node 1 aggregating the service sub-layers
   of DetNet flows 1 and 2 into a service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet
   flow 1.  It also illustrates the Relay node 2 disaggregating the
   aggregated DetNet flow 1 into the DetNet flows 1 and 2 service sub-
   layers.  A diagram illustrating both aggregation and disaggregation
   is shown and then the corresponding JSON operational data follows.

   Please consult the PDF or HTML versions for the Case C-3 Diagram.

B.7.  Example C-4 JSON Relay Service Sub-Layer Aggregation/
      Disaggregation

   This illustrates the Relay node 1 aggregating the forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flow 1 and 2 into a service sub-layer of Aggregated
   DetNet flow 1.  This also illustrates the Relay node 2 disaggregating
   the service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet flow 1 to forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flow 1 and 2.  A diagram illustrating both
   aggregation and disaggregation is shown and then the corresponding
   JSON operational data follows.

B.8.  Example D-1 JSON Transit Forwarding Sub-Layer Aggregation/
      Disaggregation

   This illustrates the Transit node 1 aggregating the forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flow 1 and 2 into a forwarding sub-layer.  This also
   illustrates a Transit node 4 disaggregating a forwarding sub-layer
   into DetNet flow 1 and 2 forwarding sub-layers.
