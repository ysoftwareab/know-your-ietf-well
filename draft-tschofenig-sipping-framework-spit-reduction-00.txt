Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The problem of Spam for Internet Telephony (SPIT) is an imminent
   challenge and only the combination of several techniques can provide
   a framework for dealing with unwanted communication attempts.

   [I-D.ietf-sipping-spam] provides four core recommendations that need
   to be considered for a SPIT solution, namely

   o  Strong Identity
   o  White Lists
   o  Solve the Introduction Problem
   o  Don't Wait Until its Too Late

   This document illustrates how existing building blocks can be put
   together to form a solution to deal with SPIT.  New building blocks
   can be added to provide more efficient SPIT handling, since there is
   no single solution that provides 100 % protection.

   The main purpose of this document is largely to define a model of
   internal device processing, protocol interfaces, and terminology,
   which define a way in which we can plug-in future protocols.  We
   focus only on the most important solution components and consider
   many other aspects either outside the scope of this work (see
   Appendix A) and postpone them for future work.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Framework

   The framework considered in this document assumes that an end user
   uploads authorization policies to a SIP proxy of its VoIP provider.
   That VoIP provider enforces those authorization policies.  This
   separation allows the end user to offload some authorization
   decisions to the VoIP provider which can save bandwidth and activity
   on the SIP UA.

   Figure 1 below shows the interaction between the end host and a SIP
   proxy belonging to its VoIP provider.  The end user, in the role of a
   recipient for communication attempts, uploads authorization policies.
   These policies are processed by corresponding module within the SIP
   proxy, called Authorization Engine, that interacts with the message

   routing functionality.  A part of the rule set might, however, also
   be created automatically as part of interactive interactions (e.g.,
   monitoring ongoing communication attempts).

                            Figure 1: Overview

   Assume that an arbitrary sender transmits a message towards the
   recipients URI that finally hits the SIP proxy on the recipients
   side.  Information provided within that message are used as input to
   the rule evaluation.  Any part of the message may serve as input to
   the evaluation process but for practical reasons only a few selected
   fields do most of the work.  In this document, we argue that the
   authenticated identity of the sender is the most valuable information
   item.  In the future, when standardization progresses then, for
   example, reputation information obtained from social networks may
   offer additional input to the authorization process.  The protocol

   interaction for authorizing the message sender refers to the ability
   of the recipient or the proxy to interact with the sender to request
   authorization.  The request for authorization is a pull model whereby
   the proxy or the recipient challenges the sender (e.g., via hash cash
   [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash], or SIP payment
   [I-D.jennings-sipping-pay]) for authorization.  SIP Identity on the
   other hand realizes as push model whereby authentication information
   is pushed towards the recipient.

   Figure 2 shows this integration step.  The conditions part of the
   rule offer a mechanisms to incrementally extend the overall framework
   with new SPIT prevention solution components.  Depending on the rule
   evaluation the message may be rerouted to another entity, such as an
   answering machine, to the recipient, rejected or other actions are
   triggered.  The latter aspect is particularly interesting since it
   allows further solution components to be executed.  For example, a
   permission request as part of the consent framework.

                  Figure 2: Message Filtering and Routing

   Note that some traffic analysis and consequently some form of content
   filtering (e.g., of MESSAGEs) can be applied locally within the VoIP
   provider's domain also under the control of the end user.  For
   example, a user that does not want content filtering to impact
   message handling would therefore not utilize this functionality.

   In a minimalistic SPIT framework only authenticated identities in
   combination with authorization policies are used.  This should serve
   as a starting point for future work.

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             June 2007


   Authenticated Identities:

      SIP Identity [RFC4474] is assumed to be used to provide the
      receiver of a communication attempt with the authenticated
      identity.  SIP Identity is a reasonable simple specification and
      does not rely on a huge amount of infrastructure support.
         Note: SIP Identity is comparable to DKIM
         [I-D.ietf-dkim-overview] used for associating a "responsible"
         identity with an email message and provides a means of
         verifying that the association is legitimate.

   Authorization Policies:

      When the white lists are stored and managed only at the end host
      then the authorization policies and the protocol to modify the
      policies do not need to be standardized since they are purely
      implementation specific details.  Even if the authorization
      policies are managed centrally or some amount of policy
      enforcement is done by trusted intermediaries then still there
      might not be a need to standardize an authorization policy
      language if the policies can be modified via a webpage.  This type
      of policy handling is done in many cases today already for various
      applications.

      Unfortunately, this approach tends to become cumbersome to manage
      for end users and therefore it is useful to hide a lot of policy
      details from the end user itself and to make use of context
      information, for example, address books and authorization policies
      available already created for presence based systems.

      In some cases the above-described approach is not sufficient
      whereby it is necessary to define a standardized protocol, for
      example, if policies are used by different entities, created and
      modified in an automatic way and when multiple entities manipulate
      policies (potentially on behalf of the person affected by the
      policies).


   The white list needs to be created somehow and hence there is an
   introduction problem.  Section 4 discusses this aspect in more
   details.


4.  Communication Patterns and User Groups

   When communication takes place then at least three types of groups
   can be identified.




Tschofenig, et al.      Expires December 16, 2007               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             June 2007


4.1.  Closed Groups

   People in this group communicate only with the peers in their group.
   They do not appreciate communication attempts from outside.
   Communication is possible only for people within this list.  Here is
   an example of a closed group: Consider parents that do not want their
   children from getting contaced by strangers.  Hence, they may create
   a white list containing the identifies of known friends, parents and
   other relatives on behalf of their kids.

   The usage of authorization policies for usage with Closed Groups is
   straight forward.

4.2.  Semi-Open Groups

   In a semi-open environment all members of the same group are allowed
   to get in contact with everyone else (e.g., for example in a company
   environment).  For members outside the company the communication
   patters depend on the role of the person (e.g., standardization
   people, sales people, etc.) and on the work style of the person.

   For this category we distinguish a number of (non-spam) message
   sources based on their characteristics:

   o  "friends" or "acquaintances", i.e., those we have communicated
      with before.
   o  strangers, divided into 'interesting' and 'uninteresting'.  The
      latter are messages from people that someone does not care to have
      a conversation with or respond to, at least at that particular
      moment.

   Strangers can be defined by individual names or whole domains.  A
   special class of 'stranger' messages are transaction-related
   communications, such as Instant Messaging or automated calls from an
   airline or shipping company.

   The usage of authorization policies for usage with Semi-Open Groups
   can be considered manageable.

   In the PSTN a certain amount of protection against unwanted calls is
   provided due to costs for phone calls.  With almost free calls (or
   instant messages) it might be necessary to abandon the idea of
   allowing end-to-end real-time message delivery in all cases in order
   to avoid the alerting the user.

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             June 2007


4.3.  Open Groups

   People in this type of group are not allowed to limit communication
   attempts.  Help desks, certain people in governmental agencies,
   banks, insurance companies, etc.

   For Open Groups the situation is more complicated.  Consider a person
   working on a customer support helpdesk.  Ideally, they would like to
   receive only calls from friendly customers (although the motivation
   for calling is most likely a problem) and the topic of the calls only
   relates to problems they are able to solve.  Without listening to the
   caller they will have a hard time to know whether the call could be
   classified as SPIT.  Many SPIT prevention techniques might not be
   applicable since blocking callers is likely not possible and applying
   other techniques, such as turing tests, might not be ideal in an case
   of Open Groups.

4.4.  Summary

   Based on the discussions regarding communication patters and groups
   the following observations can be made:

   o  A single person very likely has many roles and they may have an
      impact on the communication patterns.
         For example, consider a person who is working in a company but
         also want to be available for family members.
   o  The context in which a person is may change at any time.  For
      example, a person might be available for family members while at
      work except during an important meeting where communication
      attempts may be rejected.  Switching a context has an impact for
      reachability and the means for communicating with a specific
      recipient, based on enabled rule sets.

   From an authorization policy point of view it is important to be able
   to express a sphere, i.e., the state a user is in and to switch
   between different spheres easily by thereby switching to a different
   rule set.

4.5.  Usability

   An important aspect in the usage of authorization policies is to
   assist the user when creating policies.  Ideally, the policies should
   be established automatically.  Below, there are a couple of examples
   to illustrate the idea given that these aspects are largely
   implementation issues:






Tschofenig, et al.      Expires December 16, 2007               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             June 2007


   o  It must be possible for the proxy to automatically add addresses
      on outbound messages and calls to the rule set.  This approach is
      similar to stateful packet filtering firewalls where outbound
      packets establish state at the firewall to allow inbound packets
      to traverse it again.
   o  Already available information in the address book can be used for
      building the policy rules there is quite likely already a
      relationship available with these persons existent.
   o  A large amount of email is non-personal, automated communication,
      such as newsletters, confirmations and legitimate advertisements.
      These are often tagged as spam by content filters.  This type of
      correspondence is usually initiated by a transaction over the web,
      such as a purchase or signing up for a service.
      [I-D.shacham-http-corr-uris], for example, defines an HTTP header
      for conveying future correspondence addresses that can be
      integrated in the rule set.


5.  Protocol Interactions

   This section describes the necessary building blocks that are
   necessary to tie the framework together.  We will describe two
   different environments, namely one where rule enforcement happens at
   the end host and another one where a trusted network intermediary
   performs the actions.

5.1.  End Host based Rule Enforcement

   o  SIP Identity [RFC4474] is mandatory to implement at the end host
      and used to determine the authenticated identity of the sending
      side.
   o  Authorization policies are purely implementation specific matter.

   Since a purely end host based rule enforcement suffers from a number
   of drawbacks, rule enforcement by a trusted intermediary is also
   offered.

5.2.  Rule Enforcement via a Trusted Intermediary

   o  SIP Identity [RFC4474] is mandatory to implement at the trusted
      intermediary (e.g., the immediate VoIP provider) and it determines
      the authenticated identity of the sending side.
   o  Authorization Policies based on the Common Policy framework
      [RFC4745], as extended in [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy] for
      the purpose of SPIT prevention, are mandatory to implement at the
      end host side and at the trusted intermediary.  The implementation
      of the rule evaluation engine might only be necessary on the
      trusted VoIP proxy.  Harmonization with the work done for presence

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             June 2007


      authorization [I-D.ietf-simple-presence-rules], which is based on
      Common Policy [RFC4745], can be accomplished and is highly
      desirable.
   o  XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [I-D.ietf-simple-xcap] is
      used to create, modify and delete authorization policies and is
      mandatory to implement at the end host side and at the trusted
      intermediary.

5.3.  Incremental Deployment

   An important property is incremental deployment of additional
   solution components that can be added and used when they become
   available.  This section aims to illustrate how the extensibility is
   accomplished, based on an example.

   Consider a VoIP provider that provides authorization policies that
   provide the following functionality equivalent to the Common Policy
   framework, i.e., identity-based, sphere and validity based conditions
   initially.  For actions only 'redirection' and 'blocking' is
   provided.  In our example we give this basic functionality the AUID
   'new-spit-policy-example' with the namespace
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:new-spit-policy-example'.

   When a client queries the capabilities of a SIP proxy in the VoIP
   providers network using XCAP the following exchange may take place.

           Initial XCAP Response with the supported Capabilities

   As shown in the example above, Common Policy and the example SPIT
   extension is implemented and the client can upload rules according to
   the definition of the rule set functionality.

   Later, when the VoIP provider updates the functionality of
   authorization policies as more sophisticated mechanisms become
   available and get implemented the functionality of the authorization
   policy engine is enhanced with, for example, hashcash and the ability
   to perform statistical analysis of signaling message.  The latter
   functionality comes with the ability to mark messages are Spam and
   the ability for end users to enable/disable this functionality.  We
   use the AUIDs 'hashcash', 'statistical-analysis' with the namespace
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:hashcash' and
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:statistical-analysis', respectively.

   A end user could now make use of these new functions and a capability
   query of the SIP proxy would provide the following response.


   GET   /xcap-caps/global/index HTTP/1.1
   Host: xcap.example.com

   New SPIT handling functionality may extend condition, actions and/or
   transformation elements of a rule.


6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not propose to distribute the user's authorization
   policies to other VoIP providers nor is the configuration of policies
   at SIP proxies other than the trusted user's VoIP provider necessary.
   Furthemore, if blocking or influencing of the message processing is
   executed by the VoIP provider then they have to be explicitly enabled
   by the end user.  Blocking of messages, even if it is based on
   "super-clever" machine learning techniques often introduces
   unpredictability.

   Legal norms from fields of law can take regulative effects in the
   context of SPIT processing, such as constitutional law, data
   protection law, telecommunication law, teleservices law, criminal
   law, and possibly administrative law.  See, for example, [Law1],
   [Law2] and [Law3].  For example, it is mandatory to pass full control
   of SPIT filtering to the end user, as this minimises legal problems.

   An overview about regulatory aspects can be found in [Spit-AL].


7.  Example

   This section shows an example whereby we consider a user
   Bob@company-example.com that writes (most likely via a nice user
   interface) the following policies.  We use a high-level language to
   show the main idea of the policies.


   RULE 1:
        IF identity=alice@foo.example.com THEN ACCEPT
        IF identity=tony@bar.example.com THEN ACCEPT

   RULE 2:
        IF domain=company-example.com THEN ACCEPT

   RULE 3:
        IF unauthenticated THEN
               EXECUTE hashcast
               REDIRECT sip:voicebox@company-example.com

                         Example of Bob's Rule Set

   At some point in time Bob uploads his policies to the SIP proxy at

   his VoIP providers SIP proxy.


      PUT
      /spit-services/users/sip:bob@company-example.com/index/~~/spit-services/
      service%5b@uri=%22sip:good-friends@example.com%22%5d
      HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type:application/spit+xml
      Host: proxy.home-example.com

       <<<< Policies go in here. >>>>

                       Uploading Policies using XCAP

   When BoB receives a call from his friends, alice@foo.example and
   tony@bar.example.com, then the call is forwarded without any further
   checks based on Rule 1.  The rules assume that the authenticated
   identity of the caller has been verified.

   When Bob receives a call from a co-worker,
   Charlie@company-example.com, Rule 2 is applied since the domain part
   in the rule matches the domain part of Charlie's identity.

   Now, when Bob receives a contact from an unknwon user, called Mallice
   in this example.  Rule 3 indicates that an extended return-
   routability test using hashcash is used with the call being
   redirected to Bob's voicebox afterwards.  This exchange is shown in
   the figure below.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document aims to describe a framework for addressing Spam for
   Internet Telephony (SPIT) in order to make it simple for users to
   influence the behavior of SIP message routing with an emphasis on
   SPIT prevention.

   The framework relies on three building blocks, namely SIP Identity,
   authorization policies based on Common Policy and Presence
   Authorization Policy, and XCAP.

   As a high-level overview, the framework allows the user to control
   end-to-end connectivity at the SIP message routing level whereby the
   glue that lets all parts fit together is based on authorization
   policies.  Several other solution components can be developed
   independently and can be plugged into the framework as soon as
   available.

   It must be avoided to introduce Denial of Service attacks against the
   recipient by misguiding him or her to install authorization policies
   that allow senders to bypass the policies although that was never
   intended by the recipient.  Additionally, it must not be possible by
   extensions to the authorization policy framework to create policies
   to block legitimate senders or to stall the processing of the
   authorization policy engine.
