     Abstract 
      
        This document defines the architectural framework for ForCES 
        (Forwarding and Control Element Separation) network elements (NE), 
        and identifies the associated entities and the interaction among 
        them.  This framework is intended to satisfy the requirements 
        specified in the ForCES requirements draft [FORCES-REQ].

     1. Definitions 
         
        A set of terminology associated with the ForCES requirements is 
        defined in [FORCES-REQ] and we only include the ones that are most 
        relevant to this document here.  
         
        Forwarding Element (FE) - A logical entity that implements the 
        ForCES protocol.  FEs use the underlying hardware to provide per-
        packet processing and handling as directed by a CE via the ForCES 
        protocol.  
         
        Control Element (CE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES 
        protocol and uses it to instruct one or more FEs how to process 
        packets.  CEs handle functionality such as the execution of control  
        and signaling protocols.

        ForCES Network Element (NE) - An entity composed of one or more CEs 
        and one or more FEs.  To entities outside a NE, the NE represents a 
        single point of management.  Similarly, a NE usually hides its 
        internal organization from external entities.  
             
        Pre-association Phase - The period of time during which a FE Manager 
        (see below) and a CE Manager (see below) are determining which FE 
        and CE should be part of the same network element. Any partitioning 
        of PFEs and PCEs occurs during this phase.  
             
        Post-association Phase - The period of time during which a FE does 
        know which CE is to control it and vice versa, including the time 
        during which the CE and FE are establishing communication with one 
        another.  
             
        ForCES Protocol - While there may be multiple protocols used within 
        the overall ForCES architecture, the term "ForCES protocol" refers 
        only to the ForCES post-association phase protocol (see below).  
             
        ForCES Post-Association Phase Protocol - The protocol used for post-
        association phase communication between CEs and FEs.  This protocol 
        does not apply to CE-to-CE communication, FE-to-FE communication, or 
        to communication between FE and CE managers.  The ForCES protocol is 
        a master-slave protocol in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters.  
        This protocol includes both the management of the communication 
        channel (e.g., connection establishment, heartbeats) and the control 
        messages themselves. This protocol could be a single protocol or 
        could consist of multiple protocols working together.
             
        FE Manager - A logical entity that operates in the pre-association 
        phase and is responsible for determining to which CE(s) a FE should 
        communicate.  This process is called CE discovery and may involve 
        the FE manager learning the capabilities of available CEs.  A FE 
        manager may use anything from a static configuration to a pre-
        association phase protocol (see below) to determine which CE(s) to 
        use.  Being a logical entity, a FE manager might be physically 
        combined with any of the other logical entities mentioned in this 
        section.  
             
        CE Manager - A logical entity that operates in the pre-association  
        phase and is responsible for determining to which FE(s) a CE should    
        communicate.  This process is called FE discovery and may involve 
        the CE manager learning the capabilities of available FEs.  A CE 
        manager may use anything from a static configuration to a pre-
        association phase protocol (see below) to determine which FE to use.  
        Being a logical entity, a CE manager might be physically combined 
        with any of the other logical entities mentioned in this section.  
             
        Pre-association Phase Protocol - A protocol between FE managers and 
        CE managers that is used to determine which CEs or FEs to use.  A 
        pre-association phase protocol may include a CE and/or FE capability 
        discovery mechanism.  Note that this capability discovery process is

        wholly separate from (and does not replace) that used within the 
        ForCES protocol.  However, the two capability discovery mechanisms 
        may utilize the same FE model.   
             
        FE Model - A model that describes the logical processing functions 
        of a FE.  
             
        ForCES Protocol Element - A FE or CE.  
             
     2. Introduction to Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES)  
      
        An IP network element (NE) appears to external entities as a 
        monolithic piece of network equipment, e.g., a router, NAT, 
        firewall, or load balancer. Internally, however, an IP network 
        element (NE) (such as a router) is composed of numerous logically 
        separated entities that cooperate to provide a given functionality 
        (such as routing).  Two types of network element components exist: 
        control element (CE) in control plane and forwarding element (FE) in 
        forwarding plane (or data plane).  Forwarding elements typically are 
        ASIC, network-processor, or general-purpose processor-based devices 
        that handle data path operations for each packet.  Control elements 
        are typically based on general-purpose processors that provide 
        control functionality like routing and signaling protocols.   
         
        ForCES aims to define a framework and associated protocol(s) to 
        standardize information exchange between the control and forwarding 
        plane. Having standard mechanisms allows CEs and FEs to become 
        physically separated standard components. This physical separation 
        accrues several benefits to the ForCES architecture. Separate 
        components would allow component vendors to specialize in one 
        component without having to become experts in all components. 
        Standard protocol also allows CEs and FEs from different component 
        vendors to interoperate with each other and hence it becomes 
        possible for system vendors to integrate together CEs and FEs from 
        different component vendors. This interoperability translates into a 
        lot more design choices and flexibility to the system vendors. 
        Overall, ForCES will enable rapid innovation in both the control and 
        forwarding planes while maintaining interoperability. Scalability is 
        also easily provided by this architecture in that additional 
        forwarding or control capacity can be added to existing network 
        elements without the need for forklift upgrades. 
         
        One example of such physical separation is at the blade level. 
        Figure 1 shows such an example configuration of a router, with two 
        control blades and multiple router (forwarding) blades, all 
        interconnected into a switch fabric backplane. In such chassis 
        configuration, the control blades are the CEs while the router 
        blades are FEs, and the switch fabric backplane provides the 
        physical interconnect for all the blades. Control blade A may be the 
        primary CE while control blade B is the backup CE providing 
        redundancy. It is also possible to have a redundant switch fabric 
        for high availability support. Routers today with this kind of 
        configuration use proprietary interface for messaging between CEs

        and FEs. The goal of ForCES is to replace such proprietary interface 
        with a standard protocol. With a standard protocol like ForCES 
        implemented on all blades, it becomes possible for control blades 
        from vendor X and routing blades from vendor Y to work seamlessly 
        together in one chassis.

        Another level of physical separation between the CEs and FEs can be 
        at the box level. In such configuration, all the CEs and FEs are 
        physically separated boxes, interconnected with some kind of high 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires April 2003                  [Page 5]

        speed LAN connection (like Gigabit Ethernet). These separated CEs 
        and FEs are only one hop away from each other within a local area 
        network. The CEs and FEs communicate to each other by running 
        ForCES, and the collection of these CEs and FEs together become one 
        routing unit to the external world. Figure 2 shows such an example. 
         
        In both examples shown here, the same physical interconnect is used 
        for both CE-to-FE and FE-to-FE communication. However, that does not 
        have to be the case. One reason to use different interconnect is 
        that CE-to-FE interconnect does not have to be as fast as the FE-to-
        FE interconnect, so the more expensive fast connections can be saved 
        for FE-to-FE only.  The separate interconnects may also provide 
        reliability and redundancy benefits for the NE.

                     Figure 3. Examples of CE and FE functions 
         
        Some examples of control functions that can be implemented in the CE 
        include routing protocols like RIP, OSPF and BGP, control and 
        signaling protocols like CAC (Call Admission Control), LDP (Label 
        Distribution Protocol) for MPLS, etc. Examples of forwarding 
        functions in FE include LPM (longest prefix match) forwarder, 
        classifiers, traffic shaper, meter, NAT, etc. Figure 3 shows a 
        diagram with examples in both CE and FE. Any given NE may contain 
        one or many of these CE and FE functions in it. The diagram also 
        shows that ForCES protocol is used to transport both the control 
        messages for ForCES itself and the data packets that are 
        originated/destined from/to the control functions in CE (e.g., 
        routing packets). Section 5.2.4 provides more detail on this.  
         
        A set of requirements for control and forwarding separation is 
        identified in [FORCES-REQ]. This document describes a ForCES

        document and defines a framework for ForCES network elements and 
        associated entities to facilitate protocol definition. 
         
     3. Architecture 
      
        This section defines the ForCES architectural framework and the 
        associated logical components.  This ForCES framework defines 
        components of ForCES NEs including several ancillary components.  
        These components may be connected in different kinds of topologies 
        for flexible packet processing.

                     Figure 4. ForCES Architectural Diagram 
         
        The diagram in Figure 4 shows the logical components of the ForCES 
        architecture and their relationships.  There are two kinds of 
        components inside a ForCES network element: control element (CE) and 
        forwarding element (FE). The framework allows multiple instances of 
        CE and FE inside one NE. Each FE contains one or more physical media 
        interfaces for receiving and transmitting packets from/to the 
        external world. The aggregation of these FE interfaces becomes the 
        NEÆs external interfaces. In addition to the external interfaces, 
        there must also exist some kind of interconnect within the NE so 
        that the CE and FE can communicate with each other, and one FE can 
        forward packets to another FE. The diagram also shows two entities 
        outside of the ForCES NE: CE Manager and FE Manager. These two 
        entities provide configuration to the corresponding CE or FE in the 
        pre-association phase (see Section 5.1). There is no defined role 
        for FE Manager and CE Manager in post-association phase, thus these 
        logical components are not considered part of the ForCES NE.

        For convenience, the logical interactions between these components 
        are labeled by reference points Fp, Fc, Ff, Fr, Fl, and Fi, as shown 
        in Figure 4. The FE external interfaces are labeled as Fi/f. More 
        detail is provided in Section 4 and 5 for each of these reference 
        points. All these reference points are important in understanding 
        the ForCES architecture, however, the ForCES protocol is only 
        defined over one reference point -- Fp.  
         
        The interface between two ForCES NEs is identical to the interface 
        between two conventional routers and these two NEs exchange the 
        protocol packets through the external interfaces at Fi/f. ForCES NEs 
        connect to existing routers transparently. 
      
     3.1. Control Elements and Fr Reference Point 
         
        It is not necessary to define any protocols across the Fr reference 
        point to enable control and forwarding separation for simple 
        configurations like single CE and multiple FEs. However, this 
        architecture permits multiple CEs to be present in a network 
        element. In cases where an implementation uses multiple CEs, it is 
        expected the invariant that the CEs and FEs together appear as a 
        single NE MUST be maintained. 
         
        Multiple CEs may be used for redundancy, load sharing, distributed 
        control, or other purposes.  Redundancy is the case where one or 
        more CEs are prepared to take over should an active CE fail.  Load 
        sharing is the case where two or more CEs are concurrently active 
        and where any request that can be serviced by one of the CEs can 
        also be serviced by any of the other CEs.  In both redundancy and 
        load sharing, the CEs involved are equivalently capable.  The only 
        difference between these two cases is in terms of how many active 
        CEs there are.  Distributed control is the case where two or more 
        CEs are concurrently active but where certain requests can only be 
        serviced by certain CEs. 
      
        When multiple CEs are employed in a ForCES NE, their internal 
        organization is considered an implementation issue that is beyond 
        the scope of ForCES. CEs are wholly responsible for coordinating 
        amongst themselves via the Fr reference point to provide consistency 
        and synchronization. However, ForCES does not define the 
        implementation or protocols used between CEs, nor does it define how 
        to distribute functionality among CEs. Nevertheless, ForCES will 
        support mechanisms for CE redundancy or fail over, and it is 
        expected that vendors will provide redundancy or fail over solutions 
        within this framework. 
      
      
     3.2. Forwarding Elements and Fi reference point 
        
        FEs perform per-packet processing and handling as directed by CEs. 
        FEs have no initiative of their own.  Instead, FEs are slaves and 
        only do as they are told.  FEs may communicate with one or more CEs 
        concurrently across reference point Fp.  FEs have no notion of CE

        redundancy, load sharing, or distributed control.  Instead, FEs 
        accept commands from any CE authorized to control them, and it is up 
        to the CEs to coordinate among themselves to achieve redundancy, 
        load sharing or distributed control. The idea is to keep FEs as 
        simple and dumb as possible so that FEs can focus its resource on 
        the packet processing functions.

                         Figure 5. CE redundancy example. 
         
        For example, in Figure 5, FE1 and FE2 can be configured to accept 
        commands from both the primary CE (CE1) and the backup CE (CE2). At 
        the beginning, CE1 issues commands to FEs while CE2 silently remains 
        in sync with CE1 via CE to CE protocol over Fr reference point. When 
        CE1 fails, CE2 detects it and starts to take over. Before CE2 starts 
        issuing commands to the FEs, it might need to recheck the FEs' state 
        and instruct FEs whether or not it is ok to preserve their current 
        state.  
         
        Distributed control can be achieved in the similar fashion, without 
        much intelligence on the part of FEs. For example, FEs can be 
        configured to detect RSVP and BGP protocol packets, and forward RSVP 
        packets to one CE and BGP packets to another CE. Hence, FEs may need 
        to do packet filtering for forwarding packets to specific CEs. 
      
        This architecture permits multiple FEs to be present in a NE. 
        [FORCES-REQ] dictates that the ForCES protocol MUST be able to scale 
        to at least hundreds of FEs (see [FORCES-REQ] Section 5, requirement 
        #11). Each of these FEs may potentially have a different set of 
        packet processing functions, with different media interfaces.  FEs 
        are responsible for basic maintenance of layer-2 connectivity with 
        other FEs and with external entities.  Many layer-2 media include 
        sophisticated control protocols.  The FORCES protocol (over the Fp 
        reference point) will be able to carry messages for such protools so 
        that, in keeping with the "dumb FEÆÆ model, the CE can provide 
        appropriate intelligence and control over these media. 
         
        When multiple FEs are present, ForCES requires that packets MUST be 
        able to arrive at the NE by one FE and leave the NE via a different

        FE (See [FORCES-REQ], Section 5, Requirement #3).  Packets that 
        enter the NE via one FE and leave the NE via a different FE are 
        transferred between FEs across the Fi reference point.  The Fi 
        reference point is a separate protocol from the Fp reference point 
        and is not currently defined by the ForCES architecture. 
         
        FEs could be connected in different kinds of topologies and packet 
        processing may spread across several FEs in the topology. Hence, 
        logical packet flow may be different from physical FE topology. 
        Figure 6 provides some topology examples. When it is necessary to 
        forward packets between FEs, CE needs to understand the FE topology. 
        The FE topology can be queried from FEs by CEs.

     3.3. CE Managers 
         
        CE managers are responsible for determining which FEs a CE should 
        control.  It is legitimate for CE managers to be hard-coded with the 
        knowledge of with which FEs its CEs should communicate. A CE manager 
        may also be physically embedded into a CE and be implemented as a 
        simple keypad or other direct configuration mechanism on the CE.  
        Finally, CE managers may be physically and logically separate 
        entities that configure the CE with FE information via such 
        mechanisms as COPS-PR [RFC3084] or SNMP [RFC1157]. 
         
     3.4. FE Managers 
         
        FE managers are responsible for determining to which CE any 
        particular FE should initially communicate.  Like CE managers, no 
        restrictions are placed on how a FE manager decides to which CEs its 
        FEs should communicate, nor are restrictions placed on how FE 
        managers are implemented. 
         
     4. Operational Phases 
         
        Both FEs and CEs require some configuration in place before they can 
        start information exchange and function as a coherent network 
        element. Two operational phases are identified in this framework -- 
        pre-association and post-association.

     4.1.Pre-association Phase 
      
        Pre-association phase is the period of time during which a FE 
        Manager and a CE Manager are determining which FE and CE should be 
        part of the same network element. The protocols used during this 
        phase may include all or some of the message exchange over Fl, Ff 
        and Fc reference points. However, all these may be optional and none 
        of this is within the scope of ForCES protocol.

          Figure 7. An example of message exchange over Fl reference point 
         
        CE managers and FE managers may communicate across the Fl reference 
        point in the pre-association phase in order to determine which CEs 
        and FEs should communicate with each other.  Communication across 
        the Fl reference point is optional in this architecture.  No 
        requirements are placed on this reference point. 
      
        CE managers and FE managers may be operated by different entities.  
        The operator of the CE manager may not want to divulge, except to 
        specified FE managers, any characteristics of the CEs it manages.  
        Similarly, the operator of the FE manager may not want to divulge FE 
        characteristics, except to authorized entities.  As such, CE 
        managers and FE managers may need to authenticate one another.  
        Subsequent communication between CE managers and FE managers may 
        require other security functions such as privacy, non-repudiation, 
        freshness, and integrity. 
         
        Once the necessary security functions have been performed, the CE 
        and FE managers communicate to determine which CEs and FEs should 
        communicate with each other.  At the very minimum, the CE and FE 
        managers need to learn of the existence of available FEs and CEs 
        respectively.  This discovery process may or may not entail one or 
        both managers learning the capabilities of the discovered ForCES

        exchange between CE manager and FE manager over Fl reference point.

                          Figure 8. Examples of message exchange 
                             over Ff and Fc reference points. 
                                              
        The Ff reference point is used to inform forwarding elements of the 
        association decisions made by FE managers in pre-association phase.  
        Only authorized entities may instruct a FE with respect to which CE 
        should control it.  Therefore, privacy, integrity, freshness, and 
        authentication are necessary between FE manager and FEs when the FE 
        manager is remote to the FE.  Once the appropriate security has been 
        established, FE manager instructs FEs across this reference point to 
        join a new NE or to disconnect from an existing NE. Figure 8 shows 
        example of message exchange over Ff reference point. 
         
        Note that the FE manager function may be co-located with the FE 
        (such as by manual keypad entry of the CE IP address), in which case 
        this reference point is reduced to a built-in function. 
         
     4.1.3. Fc Reference Point 
         
        The Fc reference point is used to inform control elements of the 
        association decisions made by CE managers in pre-association phase.  
        When the CE manager is remote, only authorized entities may instruct 
        a CE to control certain FEs.  Privacy, integrity, freshness and 
        authentication are also required across this reference point in such 
        a configuration.  Once appropriate security has been established, 
        the CE manager instructs CEs as to which FEs they should control and 
        how they should control them. Figure 7 shows example of message 
        exchange over Fc reference point. 
      
        As with the FE manager and FEs, configurations are possible where 
        the CE manager and CE are co-located and no protocol is used for 
        this function.

     4.2. Post-association Phase and Fp reference point 
         
        Post-association phase is the period of time during which a FE and 
        CE have been configured with information necessary to contact each 
        other and includes both association establishment and steady-state 
        communication. The communication between CE and FE is performed 
        across the Fp ("p" meaning protocol) reference point. ForCES 
        protocol is exclusively used for all communication across the Fp 
        reference point.  
         
     4.2.1. Proximity and Interconnect between CEs and FEs 
         
        The ForCES Working Group has made a conscious decision that the 
        first version of ForCES will not be designed to support 
        configurations where the CE and FE are located arbitrarily in the 
        network.  In particular, ForCES is intended for "very close" CE/FE 
        localities in IP networks, as defined by ForCES Applicability 
        Statement ([FORCES-APP]). Very Close localities consist of control 
        and forwarding elements that either are components in the same 
        physical box, or are separated at most by one local network hop.   
         
        CEs and FEs can be connected by a variety of interconnect 
        technologies, including Ethernet connections, backplanes, ATM (cell) 
        fabrics, etc. ForCES should be able to support each of these 
        interconnects (see [FORCES-REQ] Section 5, requirement #1). ForCES 
        will make use of an existing RFC2914 compliant L4 protocol with 
        adequate reliability, security and congestion control (e.g. TCP, 
        SCTP) for transport purposes. 
         
     4.2.2. Association Establishment 
         
        As an example, figure 9 shows some of the message exchange that need 
        to happen before the association between CE and FE is fully 
        established. Typically, FE would need to inform the CE of its own 
        capability and its topology in relation to other FEs. The capability 
        of FE is represented by FE model, described in another separate 
        document. The model would allow FE to describe what kind of packet 
        processing functions it contains, in what order these processing 
        happen, what kind of configurable parameters it allows, what 
        statistics it collects and what events it might throw, etc. Once 
        such information is available to CE, CE sends all necessary 
        configuration to FE so that FE can start receiving and processing 
        packets. For example, CE might need to send a snapshot of the 
        current routing table to FE so that FE can start routing packets 
        correctly. Once FE starts accepting packets for processing, we say 
        the association of this FE with its CE is now established. From then 
        on, CE and FE enter steady-state communication as described next.

        Once an association is established between the CE and the FE, the

        to exchange information to facilitate packet processing.

        Based on the information acquired through CEs' control processing, 
        CEs will frequently need to manipulate the packet-forwarding 
        behaviors of their FE(s) by sending instructions to FEs. For 
        example, Figure 10 shows message exchange examples in which CE sends 
        new routes to FE so that FE can add them to its routing table. CE 
        can also query FE for statistics collected by FE and FE can also 
        notify CE of some important events, like interface up and down, etc.

            Figure 11. Example to show data packet flow between two NEs. 
         
        Control plane protocol packets (such as RIP, OSPF messages) 
        addressed to any of NE's interfaces are typically redirected by the 
        receiving FE to its CE, and CE may originate packets and have its FE 
        deliver them to other NEs. Therefore, ForCES protocol over Fp not 
        only transports the ForCES protocol messages between CEs and FEs, 
        but also encapsulates the data packets from control plane protocols. 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires April 2003                  [Page 16]

        Moreover, one FE may be controlled by multiple CEs for distributed 
        control. In this configuration, the control protocols supported by 
        the FORCES NEs may spread across multiple CEs. For example, one CE 
        may support routing protocols like OSPF and BGP, while signaling and 
        admission control protocol like RSVP is supported in another CE. FEs 
        are configured to recognize and filter these protocol packets and 
        forward them to the corresponding CE.  
         
        Figure 11 shows one example of how the OSPF packets originated by 
        router A are passed to router B. In this example, ForCES protocol is 
        used to transport the packets from CE to FE inside router A, and 
        then from FE to CE inside router B. In light of the fact that ForCES 
        protocol is responsible to transport both the control messages and 
        the data packets between CE and FE over Fp reference point, it is 
        possible to use either a single protocol or multiple protocols to 
        achieve that. 
         
     4.2.5. Proxy FE 
         
        In the case where a physical FE cannot implement (e.g., due to the 
        lack of a general purpose CPU) the ForCES protocol directly, a proxy 
        FE can be used in the middle of Fp reference point. This allows the 
        CE communicate to the physical FE via the proxy by using ForCES, 
        while the proxy manipulates the physical FE using some intermediary 
        form of communication (e.g., a non-ForCES protocol or DMA). In such 
        an implementation, the combination of the proxy and the physical FE 
        becomes one logical FE entity.  
         
     4.3. Association Re-establishment 
         
        FEs and CEs may join and leave NEs dynamically (see [FORCES-REQ] 
        Section 5, requirements #12). When a FE or CE leaves the NE, the 
        association with the NE is broken. If the leaving party rejoins a NE 
        later, to re-establish the association, it may or may not need to 
        re-enter the pre-association phase. Loss of association can also 
        happen unexpectedly due to loss of connection between the CE and the 
        FE. Therefore, the framework allows the bi-directional transition 
        between these two phases, but the ForCES protocol is only applicable 
        for the post-association phase. However, the protocol should provide 
        mechanisms to support association re-establishment (see [FORCES-REQ] 
        Section 5, requirement #7). 
         
        The example in Figure 5 is used to illustrate what happens when the 
        association is broken and later re-established again. Section 4.2 
        already explains what happens if CE1 fails and how CE2 can take 
        over. If no CE redundancy is provided, at the association 
        establishment phase FEs need to be told what to do in the case of CE 
        failure. FEs may be told to stop packet processing all together if 
        its CE fails. Or, FEs may be told to continue forwarding packets for 
        a limited time even in the face of CE failure. No matter what the 
        instruction is, it needs to be part of the configuration when the 
        association is established.  
         
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires April 2003                  [Page 17] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES Framework                  Oct. 2002 
      
      
        In the same example in Figure 5, assuming CE1 is the working CE for 
        the moment, what would happen if it is one of the FEs, say FE1, 
        leaves the NE temporarily? FE1 may voluntarily decide to leave the 
        association. Or, FE1 may stop functioning simply due to unexpected 
        failure. In former case, CE1 receives a "leave-association request" 
        from FE1. In the latter, CE1 detects the failure of FE1 by some 
        other mean. In both cases, CE1 keeps a note of such event from FE1 
        while continue commanding FE2. When FE1 decides to rejoin again, or 
        when it is back up again from the failure, FE1 needs to re-discover 
        its master (CE). This can be achieved by several means. It may re-
        enter the pre-association phase and get that information from its FE 
        manager. It may retrieve the previous CE information from its cache, 
        if it can validate the information freshness. Once it discovers its 
        CE, it starts message exchange with CE to re-establish the 
        association just as outlined in Figure 9, with the possible 
        exception that it might be able to bypass the transport of the 
        complete initialization information. Suppose that FE1 still has its 
        routing table and other state information from the last association, 
        instead of sending all the information again from scratch, it can 
        choose to use more efficient mechanism to re-sync up the state with 
        its CE. For example, a checksum of the state might give a quick 
        indication of whether or not the state is in-sync with its CE. By 
        comparing its state with CE first, it sends information update only 
        if it is needed. 
         
         
     5. Applicability to RFC1812  
      
        [FORCES-REQ] Section 5, requirement #9 dictates that "All proposed 
        ForCES architecture MUST explain how that architecture supports all 
        of the router functions as defined in [RFC1812]." RFC1812 discusses 
        many important requirements for IPv4 routers from the link layer to 
        the application layer. This section addresses the relevant 
        requirements in RFC1812 for implementing IPv4 routers based on 
        ForCES architecture and explain how ForCES satisfies these 
        requirements. 
         
     5.1. General Router Requirements 
      
        Routers have at least two or more logical interfaces. When CEs and 
        FEs are separated by ForCES within a single NE, some additional 
        interfaces are needed for intra-NE communications. Figure 12 shows 
        an example to illustrate that. This NE contains one CE and two FEs. 
        Each FE has four interfaces; two of them are used for receiving and 
        transmitting packets to the external world, while the other two are 
        for intra-NE connections. CE has two logical interfaces #9 and #10, 
        connected to interfaces #3 and #6 from FE1 and FE2, respectively. 
        Interface #4 and #5 are connected for FE1-FE2 communication. 
        Therefore, this router NE provides four external interfaces (#1, 2, 
        7 and 8).  
         
        IPv4 routers must implement IP to support its packet forwarding 
        function, which is driven by its FIB (Forwarding Information Base).

        This Internet layer forwarding (see [RFC1812] Section 5) 
        functionality naturally belongs to FEs in the ForCES architecture.

                     Figure 12. A router NE example with four interfaces. 
      
         
        A router may implement transport layer protocols (like TCP and UDP) 
        that are required to support application layer protocols (see 
        [RFC1812] Section 6). One important class of application protocols 
        is routing protocols (see [RFC1812] Section 7). In ForCES 
        architecture, routing protocols are naturally implemented by CEs. 
        Routing protocols require routers communicate with each other. This 
        communication between CEs in different routers is supported in 
        ForCES by FEs' ability to redirect data packets addressed to routers 
        (i.e., NEs) and CEs' ability to originate packets and have them 
        delivered by their FEs. This communication occurs across Fp 
        reference point inside each router and between neighboring routers' 
        external interfaces, as illustrated in Figure 11.  
         
     5.2.Link Layer 
         
        Since FEs own all the external interfaces for the router, FEs need 
        to conform to the link layer requirements in RFC1812. Arguably, ARP 
        support may be implemented in either CEs or FEs. As we will see 
        later, a number of behaviors that RFC1812 mandates fall into this 
        category -- they may be performed by the FE and may be performed by 
        the CE. A general guideline is needed to ensure interoperability 
        between separated control and forwarding planes. The guideline we 
        offer here is that in general CEs are required to be capable of 
        these kind of operations while FEs may or may not choose to 
        implement them. FE model should indicate its capabilities in this 
        regard so that CEs can decide where these functions are implemented. 
         
        Interface parameters, including MTU, IP address, etc., must be 
        configurable by CEs via ForCES. CEs must be able to determine 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires April 2003                  [Page 19] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES Framework                  Oct. 2002 
      
      
        whether a physical interface in an FE is available to send packets 
        or not. FEs must also inform CEs the status change of the interfaces 
        (like link up/down) via ForCES. 
         
     5.3.Internet Layer Protocols 
         
        Both FEs and CEs must implement IP protocol and all mandatory 
        extensions as RFC1812 specified. CEs should implement IP options 
        like source route and record route while FEs may choose to implement 
        those as well. Timestamp option should be implemented by FEs to 
        insert the timestamp most accurately. FE must interpret the IP 
        options that it understands and preserve the rest unchanged for use 
        by CEs. Both FEs and CEs might choose to silently discard packets 
        without sending ICMP errors, but such events should be logged and 
        counted. FEs may report statistics for such events to CEs via 
        ForCES.  
      
        When multiple FEs are involved to process packets, the appearance of 
        single NE must be strictly maintained. For example, Time-To-Live 
        (TTL) must be decremented only once within a single NE. For example, 
        it can be always decremented by the last FE with egress function.  
         
        FEs must receive and process normally any packets with a broadcast 
        destination address or a multicast destination address that the 
        router has asked to receive. When IP multicast is supported in 
        routers, IGMP is implemented in CEs. CEs are also required of ICMP 
        support, while it is optional for FEs to support ICMP. Such an 
        option can be communicated to CEs as part of the FE model. 
        Therefore, FEs can always rely upon CEs to send out ICMP error 
        messages, but FEs also have the option to generate ICMP error 
        messages themselves.  
         
     5.4.Internet Layer Forwarding 
         
        IP forwarding is implemented by FEs. When the routing table is 
        updated at CEs, ForCES is used to send the new route entries from 
        CEs to FEs. Each FE has its own forwarding table and uses this table 
        to direct packets to the next hop interface.  
         
        Upon receiving IP packets, FE verifies the IP header and processes 
        most of the IP options. Some options can't be processed until the 
        routing decision has been made. Routing decision is made after 
        examining the destination IP address. If the destination address 
        belongs to the router itself, the packets are filtered and either 
        processed locally or forwarded to CE, depending upon the 
        instructions set-up by CE. Otherwise, FE determines the next hop IP 
        address by looking up in its forwarding table. FE also determines 
        the network interface it uses to send the packets. Sometimes FE may 
        need to forward the packets to another FE before packets can be 
        forwarded out to the next hop. Right before packets are forwarded 
        out to the next hop, FE decrements TTL by 1 and processes any IP 
        options that cannot be processed before. FE performs any IP 
        fragmentation if necessary, determines link layer address (e.g., by 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires April 2003                  [Page 20] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES Framework                  Oct. 2002 
      
      
        ARP), and encapsulates the IP datagram (or each of the fragments 
        thereof) in an appropriate link layer frame and queues it for output 
        on the interface selected. 
         
        Other options mentioned in RFC1812 for IP forwarding may also be 
        implemented at FEs, for example, packet filtering. 
         
        FEs typically forward packets destined locally to CEs. FEs may also 
        forward exceptional packets (packets that FEs don't know how to 
        handle) to CEs. CEs are required to handle packets forwarded by FEs 
        for whatever different reasons. It might be necessary for ForCES to 
        attach some meta-data with the packets to indicate the reasons of 
        forwarding from FEs to CEs. Upon receiving packets with meta-data 
        from FEs, CEs can decide to either process the packets themselves, 
        or pass the packets to the upper layer protocols including routing 
        and management protocols. If CEs are to process the packets by 
        themselves, CEs may choose to discard the packets, or modify and re-
        send the packets. CEs may also originate new packets and deliver 
        them to FEs for further forwarding.  
         
        Any state change during router operation must also be handled 
        correctly according to RFC1812. For example, when an FE ceases 
        forwarding, the entire NE may continue forwarding packets, but it 
        needs to stop advertising routes that are affected by the failed FE.  
          
     5.5.Transport Layer  
         
        Transport layer is typically implemented at CEs to support higher 
        layer application protocols like routing protocols. In practice, 
        this means that most CEs implement both the Transmission Control 
        Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
         
        Both CEs and FEs need to implement ForCES protocol. If some layer-4 
        transport is used to support ForCES, then both CEs and FEs need to 
        implement the L4 transport and ForCES protocols. It is possible that 
        all FEs inside an NE implements only one such protocol entity.  
      
     5.6. Application Layer -- Routing Protocols 
         
        Both interior routing protocols and exterior routing protocols are 
        implemented on CEs. The routing packets originated by CEs are 
        forwarded to FEs for delivery. The results of such protocols (like 
        routing table update) are communicated to FEs via ForCES. 
         
     5.7. Application Layer -- Network Management Protocol 
         
        RFC1812 also dictates "Routers MUST be manageable by SNMP." (see 
        [RFC1157] Section 8) In general, for post-association phase, most 
        external management tasks (including SNMP) should be done through 
        interaction with the CE in order to support the appearance of a 
        single functional device. Therefore, it is recommended that SNMP 
        management agent be implemented by CEs and the SNMP messages 
        received by FEs be redirected to their CEs. AgentX framework defined

        in RFC2741 may be applied here such that CEs act in the role of 
        master agent to process SNMP protocol messages while FEs act in the 
        role of subagent to provide access to the MIB objects residing on 
        FEs. AgentX protocol messages between the master agent (CE) and the 
        subagent (FE) are encapsulated and transported via ForCES, just like 
        data packets from any other application layer protocols.  
      
     6. Summary 
         
        This document defines an architectural framework for ForCES. It 
        identifies the relevant components for a ForCES network element, 
        including (one or more) FEs, (one or more) CEs, one optional FE 
        manager, and one optional CE manager. It also identifies the 
        interaction among these components and discusses all the major 
        reference points. It is important to point out that, among all the 
        reference points, only the interface between CEs and FEs is within 
        the scope of ForCES. ForCES alone may not be enough to support all 
        desirablet NE configurations. However, we believe that ForCES is the 
        most important element in realizing  physical separation and 
        interoperability of CEs and FEs, and hence the first interface that 
        ought to be standardized. Simple and useful configurations can still 
        be implemented with only CE-FE interface being standardized, e.g., 
        single CE with full-meshed FEs and static configuration without the 
        need for CE/FE managers. 
         
     7. Security Considerations 
         
        The security necessary across each reference point except Fp is 
        discussed throughout the document. In general, the physical 
        separation of two entities usually requires much stricter security 
        measurement in place. For example, we pointed out in Section 5.1 
        that authentication becomes necessary between CE manager and FE 
        manager, between CE and CE manager, between FE and FE manager in 
        some configuration.  The physical separation of CE and FE also 
        imposes serious security requirement for ForCES protocol. The 
        security requirements for reference point Fp (i.e., ForCES protocol) 
        are discussed in detail in [FORCES-REQ] Section 8.
