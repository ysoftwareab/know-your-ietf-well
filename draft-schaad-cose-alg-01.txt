1.  Introduction

   In the process of writing RFCXXXX [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] several
   algorithms were removed from that document to be addressed at a later
   date.  This document deals with a large set of the cryptographic
   algorithms which were removed at that time.

   This document provides the necessary conventions needed to use the
   algorithms defined in this document.  This document additionally
   provides the necessary registration in the appropriate IANA registry
   tables.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   When the words appear in lower case, their natural language meaning
   is used.

1.2.  Document Terminology

   In this document we use the following terminology: [CREF1]

2.  Signature Algorithms

   This document defines two new signature algorithms: RSA-PSS and
   Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).  Both of these
   signature algorithms are Signature Scheme with Appendix algorithms.
   (For a discussion on the difference between signature scheme with
   appendix and signature scheme with message recovery algorithms, see
   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg].)

2.1.  RSASSA-PSS

   The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is defined in [RFC3447].

   The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is parametized with a hash
   function (h), a mask generation function (mgf) and a salt length
   (sLen).  For this specification, the mask generation function is
   fixed to be MGF1 as defined in [RFC3447].  It has been recommended
   that the same hash function be used for hashing the data as well as
   in the mask generation function, for this specification we following
   this recommendation.  The salt length is the same length as the hash
   function output.

   Implementations need to check that the key type is 'RSA' when
   creating or verifying a signature.

   The algorithms defined in this document can be found in Table 1.

                   Table 1: RSASSA-PSS Algorithm Values

2.1.1.  Security Considerations

   In addition to needing to worry about keys that are too small to
   provide the required security, there are issues with keys that are
   too large.  Denial of service attacks have been mounted with overly
   large keys.  This has the potential to consume resources with
   potentially bad keys.  There are two reasonable ways to address this
   attack.  First, a key should not be used for a cryptographic
   operation until it has been matched back to an authorized user.  This
   approach means that no cryptography would be done except for
   authorized users.  Second, applications can impose maximum as well as
   minimum length requirements on keys.  This limits the resources
   consumed even if the matching is not performed until the cryptography
   has been done.

   There is a theoretical hash substitution attack that can be mounted
   against RSASSA-PSS.  However, the requirement that the same hash
   function be used consistently for all operations is an effective
   mitigation against it.  Unlike ECDSA, hash functions are not
   truncated so that the full hash value is always signed.  The internal
   padding structure of RSASSA-PSS means that one needs to have multiple
   collisions between the two hash functions in order to be successful
   in producing a forgery based on changing the hash function.  This is
   highly unlikely.

2.2.  Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithms (EdDSA)

   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] describes the elliptic curve signature scheme
   Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).  In that document,
   the signature algorithm is instantiated using parameters for
   edwards25519 and edwards448 curves.  The document additionally

Internet-DraCBOR Encoded Message Syntax: Additional Algorith  March 2016


   describes two variants of the EdDSA algorithm: Pure EdDSA, where no
   hash function is applied to the content before signing and, HashEdDSA
   where a hash function is applied to the content before signing and
   the result of that hash function is signed.  For use with COSE, on
   the pure EdDSA version is used.  This is because it is not expected
   that extremely large contents are going to be needed and, based on
   the arrangement of the message structure, the entire message is going
   to need to be held in memory in order to create or verify a
   signature.  Thus, the use of an incremental update process would not
   be useful.  Applications can provide the same features by defining
   the content of the message as a hash value and transporting the COSE
   message and the content as separate items.

   The algorithms defined in this document can be found in Table 2.  A
   single signature algorithm is defined which can be used for multiple
   curves.

                      +-------+-------+-------------+
                      | name  | value | description |
                      +-------+-------+-------------+

                      +-------+-------+-------------+

                      Table 2: EdDSA Algorithm Values

   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] describes the method of encoding the signature
   value.

   When using a COSE key for this algorithm the following checks are
   made:

   o  The 'kty' field MUST be present and it MUST be 'OKP'.

   o  The 'crv' field MUST be present, and it MUST be a curve defined
      for this signature algorithm.

   o  If the 'alg' field is present, it MUST match 'EdDSA'.

   o  If the 'key_ops' field is present, it MUST include 'sign' when
      creating an EdDSA signature.

   o  If the 'key_ops' field is present, it MUST include 'verify' when
      verifying an EdDSA signature.

3.  Message Authentication (MAC) Algorithms

   This document defines no new Message Authentication Code algorithms.

4.  Content Encryption Algorithms

   This document defines no new content inception algorithms.

5.  Key Derivation Functions (KDF)

   This document defines new new key derivation functions.

6.  Recipient Algorithms

6.1.  RSAES-OAEP

   RSAES-OAEP is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm.  The defintion
   of RSAEA-OAEP can be find in Section 7.1 of [RFC3447].  The algorithm
   is parameterized using a masking generation function (mgf), a hash
   function (h) and encoding parameters (P).  For the algorithm
   identifiers defined in this section:

   o  mgf is always set to MFG1 from [RFC3447] and uses the same hash
      function as h.

   o  P is always set to the empty octet string.

   Table 3 summarizes the rest of the values.

    +----------------------+-------+---------+-----------------------+
    | name                 | value | hash    | description           |
    +----------------------+-------+---------+-----------------------+
    | RSAES-OAEP w/SHA-256 | -25   | SHA-256 | RSAES OAEP w/ SHA-256 |
    |                      |       |         |                       |
    | RSAES-OAEP w/SHA-512 | -26   | SHA-512 | RSAES OAEP w/ SHA-512 |
    +----------------------+-------+---------+-----------------------+

                   Table 3: RSAES-OAEP Algorithm Values

   The key type MUST be 'RSA'.

6.1.1.  Security Considerations for RSAES-OAEP

   A key size of 2048 bits or larger MUST be used with these algorithms.
   This key size corresponds roughly to the same strength as provided by
   a 128-bit symmetric encryption algorithm.

Internet-DraCBOR Encoded Message Syntax: Additional Algorith  March 2016


   It is highly recommended that checks on the key length be done before
   starting a decryption operation.  One potential denial of service
   operation is to provide encrypted objects using either abnormally
   long or oddly sized RSA modulus values.  Implementations SHOULD be
   able to encrypt and decrypt with modulus between 2048 and 16K bits in
   length.  Applications can impose additional restrictions on the
   length of the modulus.

6.2.  ECDH

   The algorithm ECDH is defined for use in COSE in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg].
   In this document the algorithm is extended to be used with the two
   curves defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].

   The following updates [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] sections 12.4.1 and 12.5.1.

   o  OLD: The 'kty' field MUST be present and it MUST be 'EC2'.

   o  NEW: The 'kty' field MUST be present and it MUST be 'EC2' or
      'OKP'.

   All the rest of the checks remain the same.

7.  Keys

   The COSE_Key object defines a way to hold a single key object, it is
   still required that the members of individual key types be defined.
   This section of the document is where we define an initial set of
   members for specific key types.

   For each of the key types, we define both public and private members.
   The public members are what is transmitted to others for their usage.
   We define private members mainly for the purpose of archival of keys
   by individuals.  However, there are some circumstances where private
   keys may be distributed by various entities in a protocol.  Examples
   include: Entities which have poor random number generation.
   Centralized key creation for multi-cast type operations.  Protocols
   where a shared secret is used as a bearer token for authorization
   purposes.

   Key types are identified by the 'kty' member of the COSE_Key object.
   In this document we define four values for the member.

                         Table 4: Key Type Values

7.1.  Octet Key Pair

   A new key type is defined for Octet Key Pairs (OKP).  Do not assume
   that keys using this type are elliptic curves.  This key type could
   be used for other curve types (for example mathematics based on
   hyper-elliptic surfaces).

   The key parameters defined in this section are summarized in Table 5.
   The members that are defined for this key type are:

   crv  contains an identifier of the curve to be used with the key.
      [CREF2] The curves defined in this document for this key type can
      be found in Table 6.  Other curves may be registered in the future
      and private curves can be used as well.

   x  contains the x coordinate for the EC point.  The octet string
      represents a little-endian encoding of x.

   d  contains the private key.

   For public keys, it is REQUIRED that 'crv' and 'x' be present in the
   structure.  For private keys, it is REQUIRED that 'crv' and 'd' be
   present in the structure.  For private keys, it is RECOMMENDED that
   'x' also be present, but it can be recomputed from the required
   elements and omitting it saves on space.

7.2.  RSA Keys

   This document defines a key structure for both the public and private
   halves of RSA keys.  Together, an RSA public key and an RSA private
   key form an RSA key pair.  [CREF3]

   The document also provides support for the so-called "multi-prime"
   RSA where the modulus may have more than two prime factors.  The
   benefit of multi-prime RSA is lower computational cost for the
   decryption and signature primitives.  For a discussion on how multi-
   prime affects the security of RSA crypto-systems, the reader is
   referred to [MultiPrimeRSA].

   This document follows the naming convention of [RFC3447] for the
   naming of the fields of an RSA public or private key.  The table
   Table 7 provides a summary of the label values and the types
   associated with each of those labels.  The requirements for fields
   for RSA keys are as follows:

   o  For all keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.

   o  For public keys, the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present.  All
      other fields defined in Table 7 MUST be absent.

Internet-DraCBOR Encoded Message Syntax: Additional Algorith  March 2016


   o  For private keys with two primes, the fields 'other', 'r_i', 'd_i'
      and 't_i' MUST be absent, all other fields MUST be present.

   o  For private keys with more than two primes, all fields MUST be
      present.  For the third to nth primes, each of the primes is
      represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i'.
      The field 'other' is an array of those maps.

8.1.  COSE Header Parameter Registry

   There are currently no registration requests here

8.2.  COSE Header Algorithm Label Table

   TBD

8.3.  COSE Algorithm Registry

   TBD

8.4.  COSE Key Common Parameter Registry

   There are currently no registration tasks inthis section.

8.5.  COSE Key Type Parameter Registry

   It is requested that IANA create a new registry "COSE Key Type
   Parameters".

   The columns of the table are:

   key type  This field contains a descriptive string of a key type.
      This should be a value that is in the COSE General Values table
      and is placed in the 'kty' field of a COSE Key structure.

   name  This is a descriptive name that enables easier reference to the
      item.  It is not used in the encoding.

   label  The label is to be unique for every value of key type.  The
      range of values is from -256 to -1.  Labels are expected to be
      reused for different keys.

   CBOR type  This field contains the CBOR type for the field

   description  This field contains a brief description for the field

   specification  This contains a pointer to the public specification
      for the field if one exists

   This registry will be initially populated by the values in Table 5,
   and Table 7.  The specification column for all of these entries will
   be this document.

8.6.  COSE Elliptic Curve Registry

   It is requested that IANA create a new registry "COSE Elliptic Curve
   Parameters".

   The columns of the table are:

   name  This is a descriptive name that enables easier reference to the
      item.  It is not used in the encoding.

   value  This is the value used to identify the curve.  These values
      MUST be unique.  The integer values from -256 to 255 are
      designated as Standards Track Document Required.  The the integer
      values from 256 to 65535 and -65536 to -257 are designated as
      Specification Required.  Integer values over 65535 are designated
      as first come first serve.  Integer values less than -65536 are
      marked as private use.

   key type  This designates the key type(s) that can be used with this
      curve.

   description  This field contains a brief description of the curve.

   specification  This contains a pointer to the public specification
      for the curve if one exists.

   This registry will be initially populated by the values in Table 4.
   The specification column for all of these entries will be this
   document.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are security considerations:

   1.  Protect private keys

   2.  MAC messages with more than one recipient means one cannot figure
       out who sent the message

   3.  Use of direct key with other recipient structures hands the key
       to other recipients.

   4.  Use of direct ECDH direct encryption is easy for people to leak
       information on if there are other recipients in the message.

   5.  Considerations about protected vs unprotected header fields.

   6.  Need to verify that: 1) the kty field of the key matches the key
       and algorithm being used.  2) that the kty field needs to be
       included in the trust decision as well as the other key fields.
       3) that the algorithm be included in the trust decision.

Editorial Comments

[CREF1] JLS: I have not gone through the document to determine what
        needs to be here yet.  We mostly want to grab terms which are
        used in unusual ways or are not generally understood.

[CREF2] JLS: Is is the same registry for both OKP and EC2?

[CREF3] JLS: Looking at the CBOR specification, the bstr that we are
        looking in our table below should most likely be specified as
        big numbers rather than as binary strings.  This means that we
        would use the tag 6.2 instead.  From my reading of the
        specification, there is no difference in the encoded size of the
