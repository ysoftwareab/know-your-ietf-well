1  Introduction 

    
   The rapid growth of the Internet and the increasing number of 
   Internet users have resulted in many scaling and growth problems 
   with application designs focused on operations at the ends (i.e. the 
   client or the server). This has led to a wide deployment of network 
   edge caching proxies as a key strategy to address these problems. 
   These systems have been very successful in accelerating Web content 
   delivery and reducing the load on origin Web servers.  
    
   However, the specific role of these network edge caching proxies as 
   a gateway between Web users and content providers suggests utilizing 
   them for intelligent services beyond simple caching. 
    
   There are already a variety of existing or proposed approaches that 
   implement particular services on top of a proxy platform. ICAP [5] 

  
Beck et al.                Expires May 2001                          2

   extends the basic idea of implementing value-added services on 
   proxies by handling transport of web objects between proxies and 
   content modification servers, thus, enabling remote call out 
   mechanisms. EPSFW [2, 7] describes an extended framework to provide 
   general services on top of an open proxy platform. 
    
   This document discusses several service examples possibly being 
   implemented on top of an open proxy platform as described in [2, 7]. 
   Each of the following service description consists of three 
   subsections: a short abstract that describes the service idea, a 
   description of the underlying business model, and finally a section 
   that mentions technical challenges to be addressed when implementing 
   these services. 
    
   Section 2 describes virus scanning as an example service, which 
   currently is one of the most frequently cited service ideas. Section 
   3, 4, and 5 describe services that dynamically assemble personalized 
   content. These services exhibit the use of the proxy device managing 
   information about the client. Sections 6 and 7 present services that 
   adapt content to the capability of client devices and client access 
   bandwidth. Some of the previous service ideas can also be applied to 
   streaming media, which is discussed in Section 8. The services given 
   in Section 9, 10, and 11 operate on client requests rather than on 
   the content itself. More service examples are given in Sections 12 
   and 13. 
    

2  Virus Scanning 

    

   2.1 Abstract 

    
   Viruses, Trojan Horses, and worms have always posed a threat to 
   Internet users. Just recently we have seen a number of e-mail based 
   worms that have hit millions of Internet users worldwide within a 
   few hours.  
    
   With the help of a content scanning and filtering system at the 
   caching proxy level, Web pages and also file transfers could be 
   scanned for malicious content prior to sending them to the user. In 
   Web pages active content like ActiveX, Java and JavaScript could be 
   scanned for harmful code (e.g. code exploiting security holes). File 
   transfers could be scanned for known viruses. If a virus is found, 
   the adaptation server could try to remove it or deny the delivery of 
   the infected content. A general rule could be that the caching proxy 
   may store and/or deliver content only, if it has been scanned by the 
   content adaptation server and no viruses are found.  
    

   2.2 Business model 

    
   This service could be offered as an additional feature to ISP 
   customers who are concerned about security issues. Likewise 
   enterprises could be interested in this solution to prevent any 
   malicious content from entering the company network.

   2.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   Web pages/files should be scanned for viruses by sending them to a 
   separate server where virus-scanning software would analyze them. 
   ICAP [5] is an example protocol for this purpose. The virus scanning 
   operations should not be performed on the caching proxy as they will 
   probably affect the performance of the caching proxy. 
    
   If HTTP file transfers are to be scanned for viruses and the 
   requested file cannot be found in the cache, we have to use a 
   different approach than for Web pages. It would not be feasible if 
   the proxy waited for the requested file to be received completely 
   before sending it over to the content adaptation server for the 
   virus scan. This approach would lead to a long delay at the user∆s 
   end, which is not acceptable. Instead, we would have to scan the 
   file transfer continuously, as it is being sent to the user (similar 
   to streaming media). 
    
    

3  Insertion of Ad Banners  

    

   3.1 Abstract 

    
   Many Internet companies rely heavily on revenue made by selling 
   advertisement space on their Web pages. Whenever advertisement 
   banners are inserted dynamically depending on who requests the page, 
   they cannot be cached, even when the content of the page itself is 
   static. This behavior prevents Web pages from being cached, although 
   their static content would allow for it. 
    
   Therefore it seems reasonable to cache the static part of those Web 
   pages at a caching proxy near the client and to insert ad banners 
   into the cached Web pages before serving them to the client.  
    

   3.2 Business model 

    
   This service is a sales item to Internet advertising networks. They 
   obtain a market from customers wishing a low cost network access in 
   return for advertising. This is the free ISP market. Also, content 
   providers who do not want to outsource their ad space management and 
   sales might be interested in providing banner images and insertion 
   rules to proxies/content adaptation servers to accelerate the 
   delivery of their Web pages. 
    
   An ad insertion module at the caching proxy of the Free ISP could 
   insert ad banners (in addition to any ad banners from the content 
   provider) into every Web page requested by a customer. That way the 
   customers of the Free ISP will not have to install any special 
   software in order to use its service. 
    

   3.3 Technical Challenges

           Example Services for Network Edge Proxies       November 2000 

   The caching proxy would have to recognize when and where to insert 
   ad banners into a Web page before serving it to the client. The 
   proxy could for instance scan the Web page for a specific marking 
   (e.g. a special tag). In the case of a Free ISP ad banners would 
   probably always be inserted at the same position (e.g. in a frame at 
   the top of each page) or in a separate pop-up window. 
    
   If we wanted to insert advertisements based on the user and his 
   interests, we would have to identify the user (by using cookies for 
   example) and create user profiles. The user profiles could also be 
   provided by the content provider. 
    
   A standard model for identifying space where the content providers 
   allow for advertising insertion is critical. This will have to be 
   coordinated with groups defining content structure, such as XML with 
   W3C [4]. 
    

4  Insertion of Regional Data 

    

   4.1 Abstract 

    
   If a content provider wants to add user-specific regional 
   information (weather forecasts for certain areas for example) to his 
   Web pages, he has little choice but to have the user select his 
   location from a list of regions. Usually it is not possible for 
   origin servers to reliably detect from where Web users connect to 
   Web sites because user requests can get routed through a number of 
   proxy servers on their way from the client to the origin server.  
    
   In a network edge caching proxy environment user requests are 
   usually redirected to the nearest proxy that is available to respond 
   to the request.  Regional information that is relevant to all users 
   who are likely to connect to a certain proxy could be stored at the 
   corresponding caching proxy. Whenever the proxy receives a user 
   request, a module on the caching proxy could insert the regional 
   information into the requested Web page. If the Web page does not 
   contain any user-specific non-cacheable content other than the 
   inserted regional information, the Web page content can now be 
   cached for future requests. 
    

   4.2 Business model 

    
   This service could be sold to content providers who want to offer 
   regional information on their Web sites and want to accelerate the 
   delivery of their Web content. There are many cases in which a 
   content provider could profit from knowing the location of the user. 
   Users could be targeted with regional advertisement banners (see 
   also ad insertion scenario). Regional distinctions (e.g. sales 
   taxes, differing laws etc.) could be taken into consideration when 
   the Web pages are prepared for the client. It would not be necessary 
   any more to ask the user for his location prior to presenting him 
   relevant information.

           Example Services for Network Edge Proxies       November 2000 


   4.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   The regional content that is to be inserted into the Web pages would 
   have to be distributed to the corresponding caching proxies. Since 
   the regional content represents only a component of a whole Web 
   page, it cannot be cached in the same way a complete Web page can be 
   cached (unless it is an image). We have to find a mechanism to 
   determine when a regional text component needs to be updated (or if 
   the content provider should be responsible for this). 
    
    

5  Caching of Personalized/Customized Web Pages 

    

   5.1 Abstract 

    
   Many Web sites (e.g. Yahoo) offer a service where users can create 
   their own personalized version of the Web site (e.g. MyYahoo). It 
   basically means that a user can choose from a number of components 
   (e.g. stock information, weather forecasts, news etc.) and create a 
   personalized Web page with them. This leads to dynamic Web pages 
   that usually cannot be cached. However, the components of the 
   personalized Web page can be cached. Therefore, it is possible to 
   have a service module on the server create the user-specific Web 
   pages by assembling the cached Web site components. In that case the 
   origin server would not have to be contacted again and the page 
   could be served to the client directly from the network edge caching 
   proxy. 
    

   5.2 Business Model 

    
   This service would be another method of accelerating the delivery of 
   Web content to the user, particularly the delivery of 
   personalized/customized Web pages that would not be cacheable 
   otherwise. It also saves bandwidth between the origin server and the 
   proxy cache. 
    
   Content providers who offer their customers the possibility of 
   personalizing their Web pages are likely to be willing to pay for 
   this kind of service.  
    

   5.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   We would have to find a caching mechanism for the separate 
   components of the personalized Web pages (unless a component 
   consists of an image only). These components could be stored at the 
   caching proxy. 
    
   The page components would have to be refreshed just like complete 
   Web page whenever they become stale. 
    
    

6  Content Adaptation for Alternate Web Access Devices

   6.1 Abstract 

    
   There is a growing diversity and heterogeneity in types and 
   capabilities of client devices as well as the forms of network 
   connections that people use to access the Web. Clients include cell 
   phones and PDAs as well as PCs, TVs (with SetTop boxes), etc. 
   However, these appliances have quite diverse display capabilities, 
   storage, processing power, as well as slow network access. As a 
   result, Internet access is still constrained on these devices and 
   users are limited to only a small fraction of the total number of 
   Web pages available in the Internet today. Organizations such as the 
   WAP forum [4] have suggested custom Web page design but this results 
   in special code frequently required on the content server. 
    
   Since the number of different access devices is growing constantly 
   content providers cannot be expected to provide different versions 
   of their Web pages for each and every Web access device that is 
   available in the market. 
    
   Therefore, if it is possible to transcode the general full-fledged 
   Web pages at some point on their way from the origin server to the 
   user so that they are optimized for (or at least adapted to) the end 
   users' specific requirements, it would provide a valuable service 
   for the end customer, the service provider, and the content 
   provider. 
    

   6.2 Business model 

    
   With the above-mentioned service in place, Web content providers 
   could reach a much wider audience and the manufactures of diverse 
   Web access devices could offer potential customers access to a 
   bigger part of the Internet content, which should make a very good 
   selling point. It would encourage more people to buy non-desktop Web 
   access devices like cell phones and PDAs expanding the market. 
    
   We would expect this service would be offered as an additional 
   feature to ISP customers who want to access the Web through 
   different Web-enabled devices. Also, the service might be paid by 
   content providers because they could serve their existing content to 
   more users; likewise, the non-desktop device makers may contribute 
   to this service cost making their client devices more effective at 
   the Web. 
    

   6.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   Possible adaptations to meet the special requirements of different 
   Web access devices are: 
    
   - Conversion of HTML pages to WML (Wireless Markup Language) pages  
   - Conversion of JPEG images to black and white GIF images 
   - Conversion of HTML tables to plain text  
   - Reduction of image quality 
   - Removal of redundant information

           Example Services for Network Edge Proxies       November 2000 

   - Stripping of Java applets / JavaScript 
   - Audio to text conversion 
   - Video to key frame or video to text conversion 
   - Content extraction 
    
   We have to ensure that the automatic adaptation process will not 
   make changes to a Web page that are unwanted by either the content 
   provider or the recipient. Our suggested strategy to achieve this 
   would be to allow the content provider as well as the client to 
   define their preferences as to how they want Web pages to be 
   adapted. The actual adaptation decisions would then be made based on 
   the given preferences and a set of transformation rules. There would 
   have to be a mechanism of resolving potential conflicts between the 
   content provider's and the user's adaptation preferences. If neither 
   the content provider nor the client has expressed his preferences, a 
   default adaptation of the requested Web page may be possible but 
   investigation is needed. 
    
   A way for preferences to be specified representing the content 
   provider and client customer must be provided. For example, client 
   customers could set their preferences through a Web interface on the 
   ISP Web site. Content providers could express their preferences by 
   adding meta tags to their Web pages. This meta data offers the 
   content provider the ability to specify a number of alternatives and 
   the content adaptation server could then pick the most appropriate 
   one. This meta data should be independent of specific Web content 
   but is likely to depend on the types of content in the pages. 
   Another possibility in the ESPWF [2, 7] framework would be for the 
   content provider would be to provide an adaptation policy to all 
   ISPs that want to adapt Web pages for alternate Web access devices. 
   This policy could consist of general transformation rules or actual 
   code modules that perform the adaptation. 
    
    

7  Limited Client Bandwidth Adaptation 

    

   7.1 Abstract 

    
   Different Internet clients can handle different Internet connection 
   speeds. Therefore it seems desirable to adapt the requested Web 
   content to the user∆s bandwidth.  
    

   7.2 Business model 

    
   One of the main benefits is to decrease the Web access time for 
   users. If a Web site loads too slowly, users tend to leave the site 
   even before it has completed loading the home page. The improved 
   perceived quality of service by adaptive content delivery means that 
   users are more likely to stay and return, thus resulting in a 
   greater profit for e-commerce sites. This can also result in higher 
   hit rates and return rates, which can lead to higher sales for e-
   commerce sites and higher advertising revenues.

   7.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   Possible adaptations to reduce the size of Web objects are: 
    
   - Reduction of image quality 
   - Replacement of images by their ALT text 
   - Removal of redundant information 
   - Removal of HTML comments 
   - Stripping of Java applets / JavaScript 
   - Audio to text conversion 
   - Video to key frame or video to text conversion 
   - Text summarizing 
   - Content extraction 
    
   We would have to find a reliable way of determining the bandwidth 
   between the client and the proxy cache. One way of measuring this 
   would be to measure the round trip time (RTT) to determine the 
   connection speed. It is crucial that this bandwidth detection method 
   works more or less exact or otherwise the client will either 
   experience very slow Web browsing or be cut off of some (or all) of 
   the rich Web content. This service requires authorization by the 
   user like any other adaptation service that changes the content and 
   or format of Web pages. 
    
   The mapping of a user∆s connection speed to appropriate page 
   adaptations requires defining a set of adaptation rules. 
    
    

8  Adaptation of Streaming Media 

    

   8.1 Abstract 

    
   Some of the above-mentioned services could not only be applied to 
   Web pages but also to streaming media like audio and video streams. 
   In particular, media streams could be adapted to meet the bandwidth 
   of the user∆s connection. It would also be possible to insert pre-
   recorded advertisements into audio or video streams. Even content 
   analysis and content filtering could be applied to streaming media.  
    

   8.2 Business model 

    
   The business models for streaming media adaptation are similar to 
   those for Web page adaptation services.  
    

   8.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   The adaptation of streaming media will add more complexity to the 
   caching proxy platform and the technical challenges of these kind of 
   services have yet to be explored. 
    
    

9  Request Filtering

   9.1 Abstract 

    
   The success of Web filtering/blocking systems like NetNanny 
   (http://www.netnanny.com) and WebSense (http://www.websense.com) 
   shows that there is a great need for solutions that let the owner of 
   a Web access device control what kind of Web content can be accessed 
   with his device. Parents, for instance, often demand a means of 
   blocking off offending material when their children browse the Web. 
   Also, companies might want to have control over what kind of Web 
   pages their employees can have access to. Companies might also want 
   to prevent their employees from using the available bandwidth 
   excessively for non-work related activities.  
    
   A request filtering service could provide a solution for all of the 
   above. If all Web page requests of a specific user are routed 
   through a caching proxy server, the content adaptation server could 
   analyze the requests prior to fulfilling them. The service module 
   would have to identify the user and determine the user∆s access 
   level. The next step would be to look up the classification of the 
   requested Web page in a database. 
    
    

   9.2 Business model 

    
   This service could be offered to enterprises and to ISPs. A database 
   of Web pages that contain offending material could be obtained from 
   companies that have specialized in Web blocking systems. 
    

   9.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   The database on the proxy caching platform that contains the Web 
   page classifications needs to be updated on a regular basis. If the 
   database is provided by third parties, we have to provide them with 
   a secure way of updating the database. 
    
   If a Web access device is shared among different users who have 
   different access levels, it is not sufficient to identify the Web 
   access device. Therefore it will probably be necessary that 
   different users of a Web access device use different user accounts. 
    
   The owner of a Web access device must be able to define and change 
   the access rights of the user(s) of his device. This could be done 
   through a Web interface provided by the ISP/company. 
    
    

10 Request Filtering through Content Analysis 

    

   10.1 Abstract 

    
   While this service is very similar to the one previously described, 
   it works more dynamically in that the content adaptation server 
   analyzes the Web content once it has been retrieved from either the 
   proxy cache or the origin server prior to sending it to the client.

   Through the use of sophisticated content analysis algorithms it 
   should be possible to classify the analyzed Web content. If the 
   classification of the Web page matches the user∆s access level, the 
   page will be delivered to the client. Otherwise, the client will be 
   denied the page. The analyzed page along with its classification 
   should be stored in the proxy cache so that future requests for the 
   same page do not require the cached Web to be analyzed again. This 
   will result in a better Web page delivery performance for popular 
   Web pages. The main benefit of this approach is that there is no 
   need to provide or maintain lists of forbidden Web sites, a process 
   that per definition must always lag behind the creation of new Web 
   sites. If common characteristics of a category of unwanted Web pages 
   can be defined, it should be possible to automatically detect 
   whether a requested Web page falls in a forbidden category.  
    

   10.2 Business model 

    
   This service could be offered to enterprises and ISPs. The content 
   analysis software could be obtained from software companies that 
   have specialized in this field. 
    

   10.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   In addition to the technical challenges described in the previous 
   service scenario, we would have to find a way of storing the 
   classification information of Web pages once they have been 
   analyzed. One way to do this would be to add a meta tag (possibly 
   using the Resource Description Framework [6] specification) with 
   content rating information to a Web page before it is cached. 
   Subsequent requests of the same Web page would then require the 
   request filtering service module to scan the cached Web page for 
   this metadata in order to determine the content rating of the 
   requested page.  
    
    

11 Creation of User Profiles 

    

   11.1 Abstract 

    
   If all Web requests of a certain Web user were routed through a 
   certain caching proxy platform, it would be easy to log them in 
   order to create a profile of the user∆s Web browsing behavior. These 
   user profiles could be created anonymously with no personal data 
   (e.g. name or e-mail address) stored in the access log files. 
    
   Once a sufficient number of requests has been logged by the content 
   adaptation server, the marketing group could start analyzing the log 
   files. In most cases it should be possible to derive the user∆s 
   interests by analyzing what kind of Web sites the user visits and 
   how often he goes there. 
    

   11.2 Business model

   Companies that want to advertise on Web pages are very interested in 
   knowing more about the recipients of their advertisement campaigns 
   so that they can target their advertisements at people who are 
   interested in the kind of products/services that the company wants 
   to sell. These companies will pay for information that helps them to 
   target their campaigns at interested users. This money could be 
   offered to users (e.g. in the form of reduced Internet access fees) 
   to give them an incentive to agree to the profiling. 
    
   As explained above, we could derive the user∆s interests from his 
   Web browsing behavior and use this information to send the user only 
   those advertisements that match his interests/needs. This will most 
   likely result in a higher ad banner click-rate per user.  
    
   This service could be sold separately or in combination with the ad 
   insertion service. 
    

   11.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   The creation of user profiles requires a mechanism to identify Web 
   users. The ISP could provide a mapping from the user∆s (possibly 
   dynamic) IP number to some unique user ID. Another alternative would 
   be to use cookies, provided that the user has not disabled them in 
   his Web browser. 
    
    

12 Search Engine Index on Cached Web Pages  

    

   12.1 Abstract 

    
   A proxy usually contains the most frequently requested Web pages of 
   the Web users whose Web requests are routed through it. If we 
   indexed the content of all Web pages currently contained in one or 
   more proxies, we would have an index of Web pages that Web users are 
   very likely to request (since they have been the most popular in the 
   past). A search engine based on this index could therefore yield a 
   high hit rate when used by a group of users who have similar 
   interests and usually connect to the same caching proxies. The 
   benefit of this approach would be that the index could be created 
   very fast (there is no Web crawling to do) and that the search 
   results could be returned to the user directly from the network edge 
   caching proxy. The drawback, however, is that this search engine 
   would index only a small fraction of the existing Web pages. Web 
   users have to be aware of this fact when they use the cache-based 
   search index service. Another approach would be to display the proxy 
   search results first while a global search engine prepares the 
   results of a global search in the meantime. As soon as the global 
   search results become available, they will be sent to the user. 
    

   12.2 Business model 

    
   The search engine service described above could be sold to big 
   companies who have users with similar interests and want to provide

   a fast search engine. Companies offering traditional search engines 
   could be interested in combining their services with a cache-based 
   search engine service to accelerate the delivery of their search 
   results. 
    

   12.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   If the cached Web pages of more than one caching proxy were to be 
   indexed, we would have to find a way of replicating the search index 
   to all affected caching proxy servers.  
    
    

13 Language Translation 

    

   13.1 Abstract 

    
   Soon the majority of all Internet users will be non-English 
   speaking. As most of the current Web content is written in English, 
   it becomes desirable to be able to translate the English content to 
   the Web user∆s local language, even if the content provider does not 
   offer translations of his Web content. An automatic translation 
   service for all Web pages could be implemented with a content 
   adaptation server. 
    
   The proxy server will determine the Web user's preferred language(s) 
   and ask whether the content requested should be translated to the 
   user's preferred language. If the content is to be translated, the 
   proxy cache will forward the Web content to a translation server 
   where the page then is automatically translated. The proxy could 
   also locally store translated content eliminating the need to repeat 
   translations for different users. 
    

   13.2 Business model 

    
   The automatic language translation service will help break language 
   barriers and open new markets for e-commerce. The average non-
   English speaking Web user will have access to more Web content. 
   ISPs, especially those with customers in non-English speaking 
   countries, could offer this service to their customers.  
    

   13.3 Technical Challenges 

    
   The automatic translation of text found on Web pages is not a 
   trivial task. It will not be possible to translate a Web page 
   automatically without running the risk of rendering parts of it 
   incomprehensible. Worse yet, the original meaning could be changed 
   and it is not said the reader of the translated page will notice the 
   change in meaning. It is questionable whether content providers 
   would even tolerate this kind of translation service.  
    
   Therefore it is very important that the client authorizes this 
   translation service and is fully aware of its potentially faulty

   behavior. It should also be considered to mark translated pages in a 
   specific way to remind the user of the machine translation.  
    
   Other technical challenges include the automatic detection of the 
   language used in the original document and the client∆s local 
   language.
