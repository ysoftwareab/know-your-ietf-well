Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic XML
   format for presenting presence information for a presentity.  The
   Contact Information for Presence Information Data Format (CIPID) is
   an extension that adds elements to PIDF that provide additional
   contact information about a presentity and its contacts, including
   references to address book entries and icons.

1.  Introduction

   In its function of facilitating communication, the usefulness of
   presence information can be enhanced by providing basic information
   about a presentity or contact.  This specification describes a basic
   set of information elements that allow a watcher to retrieve
   additional information about a presentity or contact.

   This specification defines extensions to the PIDF [5] XML (Extensible
   Markup Language) [6] document format.

   We describe elements for providing a "business card", references to
   the homepage, map, representative sound, display name and an icon.
   All elements extend the <person> or, less commonly, <tuple> element
   in the presence data model [9].  The <tuple> element is only extended
   with CIPID elements if the information describes a service referring
   to another person that is marked by an RPID <relationship> element
   with a value other than 'self'.  All elements described in this
   document are optional.

   This additional presence information can be used in PIDF [5]
   documents, together with RPID [7], future-status [8] and other PIDF
   extensions.

   The namespace URI for these elements defined by this specification is
   a URN [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [3] and
   extended by [4]:


      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.  CIPID Elements

   Some of the elements below refer to content using URIs.  If the
   watcher retrieves the content pointed to by the URI, it may reveal to
   the presentity that it is currently using the presence application.
   Thus, for increased watcher privacy, a presence application MAY want
   to cache these objects for later use.

3.1  Card Element

   The <card> element includes a URI pointing to a business card, e.g.,
   in LDIF [11] or vCard [10] format.

3.2  Display-Name Element

   The <display-name> element includes the name identifying the tuple or
   person that the presentity suggests should be shown by the watcher
   user interface.  It is up to watcher user interface to choose whether
   to heed this suggestion or use some other suitable string.

3.3  Homepage Element

   The <homepage> element provides a URI pointing to general information
   about the tuple or person, typically a web home page.

3.4  Icon Element

   The <icon> element provides a URI pointing to an image (icon)
   representing the tuple or person.  The watcher MAY use this
   information to represent the tuple or person in a graphical user
   interface.  Presentities SHOULD provide images of sizes and aspect
   ratios that are appropriate for rendering as an icon.  Support for
   JPEG, PNG and GIF formats is RECOMMENDED.

3.5  Map Element

   The <map> element provides a URI pointing to a map related to the
   tuple or person.  The watcher MAY use this information to represent
   the tuple or person in a graphical user interface.  The map may be
   either an image, an HTML client-side image map or a geographical
   information system (GIS) document, e.g., encoded as GML.  Support for
   images formatted as PNG and GIF is RECOMMENDED.

3.6  Sound Element

   The <sound> element provides a URI pointing to a sound related to the
   tuple or person.  The watcher MAY use the sound object, such as a
   MIDI or MP3 file, referenced by the URL to inform the watcher that
   the presentity has assumed the status OPEN.  Implementors are advised
   to create user interfaces that provide the watcher with the
   opportunity to choose whether to play such sounds.  Support for
   sounds coded as MPEG-2 Layer 3 (MP3) is RECOMMENDED.  The sound
   object might also be used to indicate how to pronounce the
   presentity's name.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace URN and
   schema per [4].

6.1  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
     'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid'

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid
   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
      RFCXXXX to describe contact information presence information
      extensions for the status element in the PIDF presence document
      format in the application/pidf+xml content type.

   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: See Figure 1

7.  Security Considerations

   The security issues are similar to those for RPID [7].  Watchers need
   to restrict which content types of content pointed to by <icon>,
   <homepage>, <map>, <sound>, and <vcard> elements they render.

   Also, when a watcher accesses these URIs, the presentity may deduce
   that the watcher is currently using the presence application.  Thus,
   a presence application concerned about leaking this information may
   want to cache these objects for later use.  (A presentity could
   easily customize the URLs for each watcher, so that it can tell who
   is referencing the objects.)

   Icons and other URIs in this document could be used as a covert
   channel to convey messages to the watcher, outside the content
   monitoring that might be in place for instant messages or other
   communications channels.  Thus, entities that worry about such
   channels may want to prohibit the usage of URLs pointing to resources
   outside their domain, for example.
