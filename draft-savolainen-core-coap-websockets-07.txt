1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] is a web
   protocol designed for communications between resource constrained
   nodes.  By default, CoAP operates as a layer on top of UDP or DTLS,
   but there is interest in using CoAP also over other types of
   transports, such as TCP, TLS [I-D.ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls], or SMS
   [I-D.becker-core-coap-sms-gprs].

   An interesting transport for CoAP could be the WebSocket Protocol
   [RFC6455].  The WebSocket protocol provides two-way communication
   between a client and a server after upgrading an HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230]
   connection, and may be available in an environment that does not
   allow transportation of CoAP over UDP.  This environment can be, for
   example, a corporate network with Internet access only via an HTTP
   proxy, or a CoAP application running inside a web browser without
   access to connectivity means other than HTTP and WebSockets.

   This document specifies how to access resources using CoAP requests
   and responses over the WebSocket Protocol.  This allows connectivity-
   limited applications to obtain end-to-end CoAP connectivity either by
   communicating CoAP directly with a CoAP server accessible over a
   WebSocket Connection or via a CoAP intermediary that proxies CoAP

1.1.  Overview

   CoAP over WebSockets can be used in a number of configurations.  The
   most basic configuration is a CoAP client seeking to retrieve or
   update a CoAP resource located at a CoAP server that exposes a
   WebSocket endpoint (Figure 2).  The CoAP client takes the role of the
   WebSocket client, establishes a WebSocket Connection and sends a CoAP
   request, to which the CoAP server returns a CoAP response.  The
   WebSocket Connection can be used for any number of requests.

Internet-Draft            CoAP over WebSockets                 June 2016


   The challenge in this configuration is to identify resource in the
   namespace of the CoAP server: When the WebSocket Protocol is used by
   a dedicated client directly (i.e., not from a web page through a web
   browser), the client can connect to any WebSocket endpoint.  This
   means it is necessary that the client is able to determine both the
   WebSocket endpoint (identified by a "ws" or "wss" URI) and the path
   and query of the CoAP resource within that endpoint from the same
   URI.  When the WebSocket Protocol is used from a web page, the
   choices are more limited [RFC6454], but the challenge persists.

   Section 3 proposes a new "coap+ws" URI scheme that identifies both a
   WebSocket endpoint and a resource within that endpoint as follows:

             coap+ws://example.org/sensors/temperature?u=Cel
                  \______  ______/\___________  ___________/
                         \/                   \/
                                            Uri-Path: "sensors"
       ws://example.org/.well-known/coap    Uri-Path: "temperature"
                                            Uri-Query: "u=Cel"

                    Figure 3: The "coap+ws" URI Scheme

   Another possible configuration is to set up a CoAP forward proxy at
   the WebSocket endpoint.  Depending on what transports are available
   to the proxy, it could forward the request to a CoAP server with a
   CoAP UDP endpoint (Figure 4), an SMS endpoint (a.k.a. mobile phone),
   or even another WebSocket endpoint.  The client specifies the
   resource to be updated or retrieved in the Proxy-URI Option.

       Figure 4: CoAP Client (WebSocket client) accesses CoAP Server
        (UDP server) via a CoAP proxy (WebSocket server/UDP client)

   A third possible configuration is a CoAP server running inside a web
   browser (Figure 5).  The web browser initially connects to a
   WebSocket endpoint and is then reachable through the WebSocket
   server.  When no connection exists, the CoAP server is not reachable;
   it therefore can be considered a Sleepy Endpoint (SEP)
   [I-D.dijk-core-sleepy-reqs].  Because the WebSocket server is the

   only way to reach the CoAP server, the CoAP proxy should be a Reverse
   Proxy.

   Further configurations are possible, including those where a
   WebSocket Connection is established through an HTTP proxy.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document assumes that readers are familiar with the terms and
   concepts that are used in [RFC6455] and [RFC7252].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  CoAP over WebSockets

   CoAP over WebSockets is intentionally very similar to CoAP as defined
   over UDP.  Therefore, instead of presenting CoAP over WebSockets as a
   new protocol, this document specifies it as a series of deltas from
   [RFC7252].

2.1.  Opening Handshake

   Before CoAP requests and responses can be exchanged, a WebSocket
   Connection needs to be established as defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC6455].  Figure 6 shows an example.

   The WebSocket client MUST include the subprotocol name "coap" in the
   list of protocols, which indicates support for the protocol defined
   in this document.  Any later, incompatible versions of CoAP or CoAP
   over WebSockets will use a different subprotocol name.

   The WebSocket client includes the hostname of the WebSocket server in
   the Host header field of its handshake as per [RFC6455].  The Host

Internet-Draft            CoAP over WebSockets                 June 2016


   header field also indicates the default value of the Uri-Host Option
   in requests from the WebSocket client to the WebSocket server.

            GET /.well-known/coap HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.org
            Upgrade: websocket
            Connection: Upgrade
            Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
            Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: coap
            Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

            HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
            Upgrade: websocket
            Connection: Upgrade
            Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
            Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: coap

                 Figure 6: Example of an Opening Handshake

2.2.  Message Format

   Once a WebSocket Connection has been established, CoAP requests and
   responses can be exchanged as WebSocket messages.  Since CoAP uses a
   binary message format, the messages are transmitted in binary data
   frames as specified in Sections 5 and 6 of [RFC6455].

   The message format is very similar to the format specified for CoAP
   over UDP [RFC7252].  The differences are as follows:

   o  Since the underlying TCP connection provides retransmissions and
      deduplication, there is no need for the reliability mechanisms
      provided by CoAP over UDP.  This means the "T" and "Message ID"
      fields in the CoAP message header can be elided.

   o  Furthermore, since the CoAP version is already negotiated during
      the opening handshake, the "Ver" field can be elided as well.

Internet-Draft            CoAP over WebSockets                 June 2016


   The resulting message format is shown in Figure 7.  The four most-
   significant bits of the first byte are reserved (R) and MUST be set
   to zero.  The remaining fields and structure are the same as defined
   in [RFC7252].

   Requests and response messages can be fragmented as specified in
   Section 5.4 of [RFC6455], though typically they are sent unfragmented
   as they tend to be small and fully buffered before transmission.  The
   WebSocket protocol does not provide means for multiplexing; if it is
   not desirable for a large message to monopolize the connection,
   requests and responses can be transferred in a blockwise fashion as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-core-block].

   Messages MUST NOT be Empty (Code 0.00), i.e., messages always carry
   either a request or a response.

2.3.  Message Transmission

   CoAP requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over the
   WebSocket Connection, i.e., a CoAP client can send multiple requests
   without waiting for a response and the CoAP server can return
   responses in any order.  Responses MUST be returned over the same
   connection as the originating request.  Concurrent requests are
   differentiated by their Token, which are scoped locally to the
   connection.

   The connection is bi-directional, so requests can be sent both by the
   entity that established the connection and the remote host.

   Retransmission and deduplication of messages is provided by the
   WebSocket Protocol.  CoAP over WebSockets therefore does not make a
   distinction between Confirmable or Non-Confirmable messages, and does
   not provide Acknowledgement or Reset messages.

   Since the WebSocket Protocol provides ordered delivery of messages,
   the mechanism for reordering detection when observing resources
   [RFC7641] is not needed.  The value of the Observe Option in
   notifications therefore MAY be empty on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on reception.

2.4.  Connection Health

   When a client does not receive any response for some time after
   sending a CoAP request (or, similarly, when a client observes a
   resource and it does not receive any notification for some time), the
   connection between the WebSocket client and the WebSocket server may
   be lost or temporarily disrupted without the client being aware of
   it.

Internet-Draft            CoAP over WebSockets                 June 2016


   To check the health of the WebSocket Connection (and thereby of all
   active requests, if any), the client can send a Ping frame or an
   unsolicited Pong frame as specified in Section 5.5 of [RFC6455].
   There is no way to retransmit a request without creating a new one.
   Re-registering interest in a resource is permitted, but entirely
   unnecessary.

2.5.  Closing the Connection

   The WebSocket Connection is closed as specified in Section 7 of
   [RFC6455].

   All requests for which the CoAP client has not received a response
   yet are cancelled when the connection is closed.  If the client
   observes one or more resources over the WebSocket Connection, then
   the CoAP server (or intermediary in the role of the CoAP server) MUST
   remove all entries associated with the client from the lists of
   observers when the connection is closed.

3.  CoAP over WebSockets URIs

   For the first configuration discussed in Section 1.1, this document
   defines two new URIs schemes that can be used for identifying CoAP
   resources and providing a means of locating these resources:
   "coap+ws" and "coap+wss".

   Similar to the "coap" and "coaps" schemes, the "coap+ws" and
   "coap+wss" schemes organize resources hierarchically under a CoAP
   origin server.  The key difference is that the server is potentially
   reachable on a WebSocket endpoint instead of a UDP endpoint.

   The WebSocket endpoint is identified by a "ws" or "wss" URI that is
   composed of the authority part of the "coap+ws" or "coap+wss" URI,
   respectively, and the well-known path "/.well-known/coap" [RFC5785].
   The path and query parts of a "coap+ws" or "coap+wss" URI identify a
   resource within the specified endpoint which can be operated on by
   the methods defined by the CoAP protocol.

   The syntax of the "coap+ws" and "coap+wss" URI schemes is specified
   below in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  The
   definitions of "host", "port", "path-abempty" and "query" are the
   same as in [RFC3986].

     coap-ws-URI =
        "coap+ws:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]

     coap-wss-URI =
        "coap+wss:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]

   The port component is OPTIONAL; the default for "coap+ws" is port 80,
   while the default for "coap+wss" is port 443.

   Fragment identifiers are not part of the request URI and thus MUST
   NOT be transmitted in a WebSocket handshake or in the URI options of
   a CoAP request.

3.1.  Decomposing and Composing URIs

   The steps for decomposing a "coap+ws" or "coap+wss" URI into CoAP
   options are the same as specified in Section 6.4 of [RFC7252] with
   the following changes:

   o  The <scheme> component MUST be "coap+ws" or "coap+wss" when
      converted to ASCII lowercase.

   o  A Uri-Host Option MUST only be included in a request when the
      <host> component does not equal the uri-host component in the Host
      header field in the WebSocket handshake.

   o  A Uri-Port Option MUST only be included in a request if |port|
      does not equal the port component in the Host header field in the
      WebSocket handshake.

   The steps to construct a URI from a request's options are changed
   accordingly.

4.  Security Considerations

   CoAP over WebSockets and CoAP over TLS-secured WebSockets do not
   introduce additional security issues beyond CoAP and DTLS-secured
   CoAP respectively [RFC7252].

   The security considerations of [RFC6455] apply.

Appendix A.  Examples

   discussed in Section 1.1.

   An example of the process followed by a CoAP client to retrieve the
   representation of a resource identified by a "coap+ws" URI might be

   as follows.  Figure 8 below illustrates the WebSocket and CoAP
   messages exchanged in detail.

   1.  The CoAP client obtains the URI <coap+ws://example.org/sensors/
       temperature?u=Cel>, for example, from a resource representation
       that it retrieved previously.

   2.  It establishes a WebSocket Connection to the endpoint URI
       composed of the authority "example.org" and the well-known path
       "/.well-known/coap", <ws://example.org/.well-known/coap>.

   3.  It sends a single-frame, masked, binary message containing a CoAP
       request.  The request indicates the target resource with the Uri-
       Path ("sensors", "temperature") and Uri-Query ("u=Cel") options.

   4.  It waits for the server to return a response.

   5.  The CoAP client uses the connection for further requests, or the
       connection is closed.

Internet-Draft            CoAP over WebSockets                 June 2016


   Figure 9 shows how a CoAP client uses a CoAP forward proxy with a
   WebSocket endpoint to retrieve the representation of the resource
   <coap://[2001:DB8::1]/>.  The use of the forward proxy and the
   address of the WebSocket endpoint are determined by the client from
   local configuration rules.  The request URI is specified in the
   Proxy-Uri Option.  Since the request URI uses the "coap" URI scheme,
   the proxy fulfills the request by issuing a Confirmable GET request
   over UDP to the CoAP server and returning the response over the
   WebSocket connection to the client.
