Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [7] Events framework Events
   Framework [8] defines general mechanisms for subscribing to, and
   receiving notifications of, events within SIP networks.  It
   introduces the notion of a package, which is a specific
   "instantiation" of the events framework for a well-defined set of
   events.  Here, we define an event package for SIP conferences.  This
   package provides the conference notification service as outlined in
   the SIP conferencing framework [18].  As described there,
   subscriptions to a conference URI are routed to the focus that is
   handling the conference.  It acts as the notifier, and provides
   clients with updates on conference state.

   The information provided by this package is comprised of conference
   identifier(s), conference participants (optionally with their
   statuses and media description), conference sidebars, conference
   service URIs, etc.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3.  Conference Event Package

   The conference event package allows a user to subscribe to a
   conference.  In SIP, conferences are represented by URIs.  These URIs
   route to a SIP user agent, called a focus, that is responsible for
   ensuring that all users in the conference can communicate with each
   other, as described in Conferencing Framework [18].  The focus has
   sufficient information about the state of the conference to inform
   subscribers about it.

   It is possible a participant in the conference may in fact be another
   focus.  In order to provide a more complete participant list, the
   focus MAY subscribe to the conference package of the other focus to
   discover the participant list in the cascaded conference.  This
   information can then be included in notifications by use of the
   <cascaded-focus> element as specified by this package.

   This section provides the details for defining a SIP-specific event
   notification package, as specified by RFC 3265 [8].

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


3.1  Event Package Name

   The name of this event package is "conference".  This package name is
   carried in the Event and Allow-Events header, as defined in RFC 3265
   [8].

3.2  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   A SUBSCRIBE for a conference package MAY contain a body.  This body
   defines a filter to apply to the subscription.  Filter documents are
   not specified in this document, and at the time of writing, are
   expected to be the subject of future standardization activity.

   A SUBSCRIBE for a conference package MAY be sent without a body.
   This implies the default subscription filtering policy.  The default
   policy is:
   o  Notifications are generated every time there is any change in the
      state of the conference.
   o  Notifications do not normally contain full state; rather, they
      only indicate the state that has changed.  The exception is a
      NOTIFY sent in response to a SUBSCRIBE.  These NOTIFYs contain the
      full state of the information requested by the subscriber.

3.3  Subscription Duration

   The default expiration time for a subscription to a conference is one
   hour.  Once the conference ends, all subscriptions to that particular
   conference are terminated, with a reason of "noresource" RFC 3265
   [8].

3.4  NOTIFY Bodies

   As described in RFC 3265 [8], the NOTIFY message will contain bodies
   that describe the state of the subscribed resource.  This body is in
   a format listed in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE, or a
   package-specific default if the Accept header field was omitted from
   the SUBSCRIBE.

   In this event package, the body of the notification contains a
   conference information document.  This document describes the state
   of a conference.  All subscribers and notifiers MUST support the
   "application/conference-info+xml" data format described in Section 5.
   The subscribe request MAY contain an Accept header field.  If no such
   header field is present, it has a default value of
   "application/conference-info+xml".  If the header field is present,
   it MUST include "application/conference-info+xml", and MAY include
   any other types.

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   Of course, the notifications generated by the server MUST be in one
   of the formats specified in the Accept header field in the SUBSCRIBE
   request.

3.5  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   The conference information contains very sensitive information.
   Therefore, all subscriptions SHOULD be authenticated and then
   authorized before approval.  Authorization policy is at the
   discretion of the administrator, as always.  However, a few
   recommendations can be made.

   It is RECOMMENDED that all users in the conference be allowed to
   subscribe to the conference.

3.6  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   Notifications MUST be generated for the conference state when a new
   participant joins (i.e.  gets "connected" to) or a participant leaves
   (i.e.  gets "disconnected" from) the conference.

   Subject to a local focus policy, additional changes in participants'
   status, changes in their media types, and other optional information
   MAY be reported by the focus.

   Changes in sidebar rosters SHOULD be reported by the focus to their
   participants and MAY be reported to others, subject to local policy.

   Changes in conference identifiers and service URIs SHOULD be reported
   by the focus to the Conference package subscribers.

   Changes in other conference state information MAY be reported by the
   focus to the Conference package subscribers.

3.7  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   The SIP Events framework expects packages to specify how a subscriber
   processes NOTIFY requests in any package specific ways, and in
   particular, how it uses the NOTIFY requests to construct a coherent
   view of the state of the subscribed resource.

   Typically, the NOTIFY for the conference package will only contain
   information about those users whose state in the conference has
   changed.  To construct a coherent view of the total state of all
   users, a subscriber to the conference package will need to combine
   NOTIFYs received over time.

   Notifications within this package can convey partial information;



Rosenberg, et al.         Expires June 6, 2005                  [Page 6]


Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   that is, they can indicate information about a subset of the state
   associated with the subscription.  This means that an explicit
   algorithm needs to be defined in order to construct coherent and
   consistent state.  The details of this mechanism are specific to the
   particular document type.  See Section 4.6 for information on
   constructing coherent information from an
   application/conference-info+xml document.

3.8  Handling of Forked Requests

   By their nature, the conferences supported by this package are
   centralized.  Therefore, SUBSCRIBE requests for a conference should
   not generally fork.  Users of this package MUST NOT install more than
   a single subscription as a result of a single SUBSCRIBE request.

3.9  Rate of Notifications

   For reasons of congestion control, it is important that the rate of
   notifications not become excessive.  As a result, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the server not generate notifications for a single subscriber at
   a rate faster than once every 5 seconds.

3.10  State Agents

   Conference state is ideally maintained in the element in which the
   conference resides.  Therefore, the elements that maintain the
   conference are the ones best suited to handle subscriptions to it.
   Therefore, the usage of state agents is NOT RECOMMENDED for this
   package.

4.  Conference Document

4.1  Format

   Conference information is an XML document that MUST be well-formed
   and SHOULD be valid.  It MUST be based on Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [13].

4.2  Namespace

   This specification makes use of XML namespaces for identifying
   conference information documents and document fragments.  The
   namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a URN
   [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [5] and
   extended by RFC 3688 [14].  This URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


4.3  Versioning

   The conference information is described by a hierarchal XML structure
   with the root element <conference-info>.  The root element is the
   only element in the schema that carries meaningful version number for
   all the elements in the document.  The whole conference information
   is associated with this version number.

   The optional 'version' attribute MUST be included in the root
   <conference-info> element.

4.4  State and Partial Notifications

   All sub-elements in the <conference-info> hierarchal XML structure
   can be classified in two groups: those that carry relatively small
   amount of data and those that can potentially carry a lot of data.
   During partial notifications, the light elements are updated as
   atomic pieces of data.  On the other hand, elements that can carry a
   substantial amount of data have the general 'state' attribute
   attached to them.  That is in order to support partial notifications
   for their content.

   The 'state' attribute indicates whether the reported information
   about the element is "full", "partial" or the element is "deleted"
   from the conference state document.  The default value of any 'state'
   attribute is "full".

   A 'state' attribute of a child element in the document MUST adhere to
   its parent 'state'.  It means that if the parent's 'state' is "full",
   the state of its children MUST be "full".  If the parent's 'state' is
   "partial", the state of its children MAY be either "partial", "full",
   or "deleted".

4.5  Element Keys

   In the context of this specification, the element key is the set of
   mandatory attributes or sub-elements of the element.  The key value
   MUST be unique for the element among its siblings of the same type.

   In a partial notification event it must be possible to uniquely
   identify each sub-element among others of the same type under a
   common parent element.  In order to achieve this property, all
   sub-elements, with possible multiple appearances under a common
   parent (which has the attribute 'state') have keys defined to them.

   Below is the list of the elements with their keys as defined by this
   specification:

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   o  Elements <conference-info>, <user>, and <endpoint> use as the key
      'entity'
   o  Element <media> uses as the key 'id'
   o  Sub-element <entry> of uris-type contained in elements <conf-uris>
      and <service-uris> uses as the key <uri>
   o  Elements <available-media> and <active-media> of
      conference-medias-type use as the key <proto>
   o  Elements <maximum-user-count> and <user-count> of count-type use
      as the key <role>
   o  Element <role> of user-roles-type uses as the key <entry>
   o  Sub-element <entry> of conference-type contained in element
      <sidebars-by-val> uses as the key 'entity'
   o  Elements <associated-uris> and <sidebars-by-ref> of uris-type use
      as the key <uri>

4.6  Constructing Coherent State Procedure

   A Conference package subscriber MUST initialize the 'version'
   attribute from the <conference-info> element with the value in the
   first document received.

   The conference package subscriber locally maintains a local element
   for each element in the schema and a table for each element with
   key(s) in the schema and indexed by these key(s).

   Each time a new NOTIFY is received, the value of the local version
   number and the value of the 'version' attribute in the new received
   document are compared.  If the value in the document is less than the
   local version, the document is discarded without processing.  If the
   value in the document is higher than the local version number, the
   local version number is set to the value in the new document and the
   document is processed.  If the value in the received document is more
   than one higher than the previous local version number and the
   document contained a partial state, the subscriber SHOULD generate a
   refresh request to trigger a full state notification.

   Further processing of the conference information depends on the state
   contained in the received conference document and indicated by the
   value of the 'state' attribute in the <conference-info> element.  If
   it contains "full" state, the whole local content is flushed and
   repopulated from the document.  If it contains "deleted" state, it
   means that the conference ceased to exist and the subscriber SHOULD
   terminate the subscription by sending the SUBSCRIBE with Expires = 0.

   If the document contains "partial" state, the document is used to
   update the local content as described below.

   Starting from outer elements in the received document,

   1.  If the parent element contains "full" state, the whole local
   element content is flushed and repopulated from the document.

   2.  Otherwise, if the parent element contains "deleted" state, the
   whole element MUST be removed from the local content.

   3.  Otherwise, if the parent element contains "partial" state:

   3.1 For elements with keys, the subscriber compares the keys received
   in the update with the keys in the local tables.

   3.1.1 If a key does not exist in the local table, a row is added, and
   its content is set to the element information from the update.

   3.1.2 Otherwise, if a key of the same value does exist, for each
   sub-element in the row the algorithm is applied from step 2.2.

   3.2 For each atomic element received in the schema, the element is
   replaced with the new information as a whole.  Also, for each
   non-atomic element received in the schema with either no 'state'
   attribute included or the state attribute is set to "full", the
   element is replaced with the new information as a whole.

   3.3 For each non-atomic element with the state attribute set to
   "partial", the algorithm is applied recursively starting from step 3.

5.  Conference Data

   A conference information document begins with the root element tag
   <conference-info> of conference-type.  Sections below describe the
   complex types composing the hierarchal conference-type.  The full XML
   schema is defined in Section 6.

5.1  conference-type

   This type defines the following attributes:

   entity: This attribute contains the conference URI that identifies
      the conference being described in the document.

   state: This attribute indicates whether the document contains the
      whole conference information ("full"), only the information that
      has changed since the previous document ("partial"), or the
      conference ceased to exist ("deleted").  For more details see
      Section 4.

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   version: This attribute allows the recipient of conference
      information documents to properly order them and it MUST be
      included when used in the root <conference-info> element.
      Versions start at 0 and increment by one for each new document
      sent to a subscriber.  Versions are scoped within a subscription.
      Versions are represented using a 32 bit integer.

   The conference-type defines an extendable sequence of child elements.
   A "full" conference document MUST at least include the following
   sub-elements: <conference-description>, <conference-state>, and
   <users>.

   The child elements are described in details below:

5.1.1  conference-description of conference-description-type

   This element contains conference information that is derived from
   system conference policies, is set before the conference activation,
   and is rarely changed during the conference lifetime.

5.1.2  host-info of host-type

   This element contains information about the entity that hosts the
   conference.  This information is set before the conference
   activation, and is rarely changed during the conference lifetime,
   unless the whole conference is moved to be hosted by another entity.

5.1.3  conference-state of conference-state-type

   This element contains the dynamic information about the current state
   of the conference.

5.1.4  users of users-type

   This element can contain an unbounded number of <user> sub-elements
   of user-type each containing the information about a participant in
   the conference.

5.1.5  sidebars-by-ref of uris-type

   This element contains <entry> sub-elements of uri-type which provide
   pointers to sidebar information through sidebar URIs.  The recipient
   of the information can then subscribe to sidebar information
   independently from the main conference package subscription.

5.1.6  sidebar-by-val of conference-type

   This element provides sidebar information as a part of the main

   conference package information.

5.2  conference-description-type

   This type defines the 'state' attribute which can contain the values
   "full", "partial", or "deleted".

   This type defines an extendable sequence of the following child
   elements:

5.2.1  display-text of string type

   This element contains text description of the conference.

5.2.2  subject of string type

   This element contains the subject of the conference.

5.2.3  free-text of string type

   This element contains free form text about the conference.

5.2.4  keywords of keywords-type

   This element contains a list of words that can be used by automatic
   search engines to better classify the conference.

5.2.5  conf-uris of uris-type

   This element contains a set of <entry> sub-elements - each containing
   the information about an additional conference URI that this
   conference can be accessed by.  The value of the URI is included in
   the <uri> sub-element and its description MAY be included in the
   <display-text> sub-element.

   The purpose of the URI SHOULD be included in the <purpose>
   sub-element.  The currently defined <purpose> values to be used with
   the <conf-uris> are:

   participation: Indicates that dialing into this URI will bring the
      party into the conference
   streaming: Indicates that "listening" to this URI will provide the
      conference live content

   Future extensions to this schema may define new values and register
   them with IANA under the registry established by this specification.

   Examples of such URIs include sip: / sips: [7], h323: [17], and tel:

   [16] URIs.

5.2.6  service-uris of uris-type

   This element contains a set of <entry> sub-elements - each containing
   the URI to be used in order to access different services available
   for the particular conference.  The value of the URI is included in
   the <uri> sub-element and its description MAY be included in the
   <display-text> sub-element.

   The purpose of the URI SHOULD be included in the <purpose>
   sub-element.  The currently defined <purpose> values to be used with
   the <service-uris> are:

   web-page: Indicates the web page containing the additional
      information about the conference
   recording: Indicates the link at which the recorded conference
      context can be retrieved
   event: Indicates the URI to which the subscription to the conference
      event package needs to be performed

   Future extensions to this schema may define new values and register
   them with IANA under the registry established by this specification.

5.2.7  maximum-user-count of user-count-type

   This element is used to specify the maximum number of users permitted
   in the conference.  The number SHOULD be provided for all
   participants in total by populating the <role> sub-element with value
   "any".  Additionally counters for users with certain roles in the
   conference MAY be separately provided.

5.2.8  available-media of conference-medias-type

   This element contains information about the media types available in
   the conference.  The <entry> sub-element MUST contain one of the
   values registered for "proto" of SDP [3] and its later revision(s).

5.3  host-type

   This type defines the 'state' attribute which can contain the values
   "full", "partial", or "deleted".

   This type defines an extendable sequence of the following child
   elements:






Rosenberg, et al.         Expires June 6, 2005                 [Page 13]


Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


5.3.1  display-text of string type

   This element contains display text information about the entity
   hosting the conference.

5.3.2  web-page of anyURI type

   This element contains a web page URI about the user hosting the
   conference.

5.3.3  uris of uris-type

   The <entity> sub-element contains additional URIs pointing to the
   conference host.

5.4  conference-state-type

   This type defines the 'state' attribute which can contain the values
   "full", "partial", or "deleted".

   This type defines an extendable sequence of the following child
   elements.

5.4.1  user-count of user-count-type

   This element is used to specify the current number of users in the
   conference.  The number SHOULD be provided for all participants in
   total by populating the <role> sub-element with value "any".
   Additionally counters for users with certain roles in the conference
   MAY be separately provided.

5.4.2  active of Boolean type

   This element says whether the conference is currently active or not.
   For example, a conference can be scheduled for a certain start time
   and its conference URI reserved and published.  Still, the conference
   will not be "active" till its actual start time.

5.4.3  locked of Boolean type

   This element contains information about whether the conference is
   currently locked.  In this context, "locked" means that the
   conference roster can not be added to (although participants may
   leave or be removed from the conference).

5.4.4  active-media of conference-medias-type

   This element contains information about the media types currently



Rosenberg, et al.         Expires June 6, 2005                 [Page 14]


Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   active in the conference, which is a subset of those listed in the
   <available-media> element.

5.5  user-type

   This type defines the following attributes:

   entity: This attribute contains the URI for the user in the
      conference.  This is a logical identifier, which corresponds to
      the authenticated identity of the participant.  The 'entity'
      attribute MUST be unique in the user element list because it is
      used as the key in partial notifications about users' state.  An
      anonymous participant in a conference SHOULD be represented by an
      anonymous URI generated by the focus.  For multiple anonymous
      participants, the focus must ensure that each anonymous URI is
      unique.  The guidelines for generating anonymous URIs in RFC 3323
      [9] should be followed.  For example,

   "Anonymous1" <sip:anonymous1@anonymous.invalid>

       could be used for a participant requesting privacy.

   state: This attribute indicates whether the document contains the
      whole conference information ("full"), only the information that
      has changed since the previous document ("partial"), or the
      conference ceased to exist ("deleted").

   This type defines an extendable sequence of the following child
   elements.

5.5.1  display-text of string type

   This element contains the display text for the user.

5.5.2  associated-aors of anyURI type

   This element contains associated URIs of the user.  Usually this
   information will be manually provided by a system administrator
   showing the logical association between signaling entities otherwise
   independent.

5.5.3  roles of user-roles-type

   This element contains the roles of the user.

5.5.4  language of language type

   This element contains the language preference of the user.  This

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   information can be automatically learned via call signaling or be
   manually set per participant.

5.5.5  cascaded-focus of anyURI type

   This element contains a conference URI (different from the main
   conference URI) for users that are connected to the main conference
   as a result of focus cascading.  In accordance with the SIP
   conferencing framework [18], this package allows for representation
   of peer-to-peer (i.e.  "flat") focus cascading only.  The actual
   cascading graph can not be deduced from the information provided in
   the package alone.  Advanced applications can construct the graph by
   subscribing to both this package and the Dialog Package [19] of the
   cascaded foci and correlating the relevant information.

5.5.6  endpoint of endpoint-type

   This element contains information about an endpoint of the user.  The
   element of the endpoint-type can have unbounded number of appearance
   in the user-type for each endpoint of the user participating in the
   conference.  In a case when authentication is performed per endpoint
   (rather than per user) in a system, a focus can be not aware of the
   logical association among endpoints being used by the same user.  In
   this case the focus MAY present the endpoints as belonging to
   separate users in the conference schema.

   In a different case, due to privacy concerns for a user, the focus
   may want to shield the information about multiple endpoints from the
   recipients of the Conference document.  To do so the focus MAY
   aggregate the multiple endpoint information into a single endpoint
   element under this user.

5.6  endpoint-type

   This type defines the following attributes:

   entity: The attribute contains the endpoint URI for the user in the
      conference.  In SIP terms, this is the Contact URI or GRUU.  The
      'entity' attribute MUST be unique in the endpoint element list
      because it is used as the key in partial notifications about
      users' endpoints.  An endpoint belonging to an anonymous
      participant in a conference SHOULD be represented by an anonymous
      URI generated by the focus.  For multiple anonymous endpoints, the
      focus must ensure that each anonymous URI is unique.  The
      guidelines for generating anonymous URIs in RFC 3323 [9] should be
      followed.

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004



   state: This attribute indicates whether the element contains the
      whole endpoint information ("full"), only the information that has
      changed since the previous document ("partial"), or the endpoint
      has been deleted from the conference ("deleted").

   This type defines an extendable sequence of the following child
   elements.

5.6.1  display-text of string type

   This element contains the display text for the endpoint.

5.6.2  referred of execution-type

   This element contains information about the user who's action
   resulted in this endpoint being brought into the conference (e.g.
   the SIP user identified by this URI sent a REFER to the focus).  It
   can contain the following sub-elements:

   when: This element contains the date and time that the endpoint was
      referred to the conference.

   reason: This element contains the reason the endpoint was referred to
      the conference.

   by: This element contains the URI of the entity who caused the
      endpoint to be referred to the conference.

5.6.3  status of endpoint-status-type

   This element contains the status of the endpoint, and can assume the
   following values:

   connected: The endpoint is a participant in the conference.
      Depending on the media policies, he/she can send and receive media
      to and from other participants.

   disconnected: The endpoint is not a participant in the conference and
      no active dialog exists between the endpoint and the focus.

   on-hold: Active SIP dialog exists between an endpoint and a focus,
      but endpoint is "on-hold" for this conference, i.e.  neither
      he/she is "hearing" the conference mix, nor is his/her media being
      mixed in the conference.  As an example, the endpoint has asked to
      join the conference using SIP, but his/her participation is
      pending based on moderator approval.  In the meantime he/she is
      hearing music-on-hold or some other kind of related content.

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004



   muted-via-focus: Active SIP dialog exists between an endpoint and a
      focus and the endpoint can "listen" to the conference, but
      endpoint's media is not being mixed into the conference.  Note
      that sometimes a subset of endpoint media streams can be muted by
      focus (such as poor quality video) while others (such as voice or
      IM) can still be active.  In this case, it is RECOMMENDED that the
      "aggregated" endpoint connectivity <status> reflects the status of
      the mostly active media.

   pending: Endpoint is not yet in the session, but it is anticipated
      that he/she will join in the near future.

   alerting: A PSTN ALERTING or SIP 180 Ringing was returned for the
      outbound call, endpoint is being alerted.

   dialing-in: Endpoint is dialing into the conference, not yet in the
      roster (probably being authenticated).

   dialing-out: Focus has dialed out to connect the endpoint to the
      conference, but the endpoint is not yet in the roster (probably
      being authenticated).

   disconnecting: Focus is in the process of disconnecting endpoint
      (either DISCONNECT or BYE was sent to the endpoint).

   Note that the defined transient statuss (e.g., disconnecting,
   alerting, etc.) could generate a lot of notifications.
   Implementations MAY choose not to generate notifications on these to
   all participants if it will generate too much traffic.

5.6.4  joining-method of joining-type

   This element contains method by which the endpoint joined the
   conference, and can assume the following values:

   dialed-in: The endpoint dialed into the conference, i.e.  sent INVITE
      to the focus, which resulted in successful dialog establishment.

   dialed-out: The focus has brought the endpoint into the conference by
      sending a successful INVITE to the endpoint.

   focus-owner: The endpoint is the focus for this conference.  This
      status is used only when a participant∆s UA acts as a conference
      focus.

5.6.5  joining-info of execution-type

   This element contains information about how the endpoint joined and
   can contain the following sub-elements:

   when: This element contains the date and time that the endpoint
      joined the conference.

   reason: This element contains the reason the endpoint joined the
      conference.

   by: This element contains the URI of the entity who caused the
      endpoint to join the conference.

5.6.6  disconnection-method of disconnection-type

   This element contains method by which the endpoint departed the
   conference, and can assume the following values:

   departed: The endpoint sent a BYE, thus leaving the conference.

   booted: The endpoint was sent a BYE by the focus, booting him/her out
      of the conference.  Alternatively, the endpoint tried to dial into
      to conference without success because was rejected by the focus
      according to local policy decisions.

   failed: The server tried to bring the endpoint into the conference,
      but its attempt to contact the specific endpoint resulted in a
      non-200 class final response.  Alternatively, the endpoint tried
      to dial into the conference without success due to technical
      reasons.

5.6.7  disconnection-info of execution-type

   This element contains information about the endpoint's departure from
   the conference and can contain the following sub-elements:

   when: This element contains the date and time that the endpoint
      departed the conference.

   reason: This element contains the reason the endpoint departed the
      conference.  When known and meaningful, it is RECOMMENDED to
      include the information as conveyed/reported by the call signaling
      in the format defined by RFC 3326 [10].  For example,

   <reason>Reason: SIP ;cause=415 ;text="Unsupported Media Type"</reason>

   by: This element contains the URI of the entity who caused the
      endpoint to depart the conference.

5.6.8  media of media-type

   This element contains information about a media stream of this
   endpoint.  The element of the media-type can have an unbounded number
   of appearances in the endpoint-type for each media stream of the
   endpoint.  Note that it is possible that media streams listed under a
   common endpoint MAY be established by separate signaling means and
   consequently belong to different signaling "calls".

5.7  media-type

   This type defines the following attributes:

   id: The attribute is a unique identifier of a media stream on a per
      endpoint basis.  This attribute is used as a key to identify media
      streams which may be added and deleted on a dynamic basis during
      the conference.  If the SDP "mid" (as defined in Grouping of Media
      Lines in the SDP [11]) is used for establishing the media stream,
      the 'id' SHOULD contain the same "mid" value, otherwise the
      notification service MUST generate an 'id' value which is unique
      in the endpoint context.

   state: This attribute indicates whether the element contains the
      whole media information ("full"), only the information that has
      changed since the previous notification ("partial"), or that the
      media element has been deleted from the conference document
      ("deleted").

   This type defines an extendable sequence of the following child
   elements.

5.7.1  display-text of string type

   This element contains the display text for the media stream.

5.7.2  proto of string type

   This element contains the media type for the media stream.  The value
   of this element MUST be one of the values registered for "proto" of
   SDP [3] and its later revision(s).

5.7.3  src-id of string type

   The <src-id> element, if applicable, carries the information about



Rosenberg, et al.         Expires June 6, 2005                 [Page 20]


Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   the actual source of the media.  For example, for the RTP/RTCP [12]
   media streams the value MUST contain the SSRC value generated by the
   endpoint for the stream it sends.

   When an RTP mixer generates a CSRC list according to RTP/RTCP [12],
   it inserts a list of the SSRC identifiers of the sources that
   contributed to the generation of a particular packet into the RTP
   header of that packet.  A quote from RFC 3550: "An example
   application is audio conferencing where a mixer indicates all the
   talkers whose speech was combined to produce the outgoing packet,
   allowing the receiver to indicate the current talker, even though all
   the audio packets contain the same SSRC identifier (that of the
   mixer)."

   If an RTP mixer compliant to the above is used, participants can
   perform an SSRC to user mapping and identify "a current speaker".

5.7.4  label of string type

   The element <label> carries a unique identifier for this stream among
   all streams in the conference and is assigned by the focus.  The
   value of this element corresponds to the SDP "label" media attribute
   defined in [21].

5.7.5  status of media-status-type

   The element <status> indicates the status in both directions of the
   media stream and has the values "sendrecv", "sendonly", "recvonly",
   or "inactive" as defined in SDP [3] and its later revision(s).  Note
   that value specifies the direction from the participant's point of
   view.  For example, a muted participant's stream will have the value
   of "recvonly".

5.7.6  call of call-type

   The <call> element is a general container for providing call
   signaling detailed information.  Note that privacy policies MUST be
   consulted before revealing this information to third-party
   participants.

   Specifically, the <sip> sub-element contains the SIP dialog
   identifier of the endpoint's dialog with the focus.  The element
   includes sub-elements <display-text>, <call-id>, <to-tag>,
   <from-tag>.

   In future, the <call> element can be expanded to include other call
   signaling protocol identifiers.

Internet-Draft             Conference Package              December 2004


   </conference-info>



8.  Security Considerations

   Subscriptions to conference state can reveal very sensitive
   information.  For this reason, the document recommends authentication
   and authorization, and provides guidelines on sensible authorization
   policies.

   Since the data in notifications is sensitive as well, end-to-end SIP
   encryption mechanisms using S/MIME SHOULD be used to protect it.

   Since a focus provides participants identity information using this
   event package, participant privacy needs to be taken into account.  A
   focus MUST support requests by participants for privacy.  Privacy can
   be indicated by the conference policy - for every participant or
   select participants.  It can also be indicated in the session
   signaling.  In SIP this can be done using the Privacy header field
   described in RFC 3323 [9].  For a participant requesting privacy, no
   identity information SHOULD be revealed by the focus such as a URI
   (e.g.  the Address of Record, Contact, or GRUU).  For these cases,
   the anonymous URI generation method outlined in section Section 5.5
   of this document MUST be followed.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a SIP event package, a new MIME type,
   application/conference-info+xml, a new XML namespace, and a new XML
   schema.

9.1  conference Event Package Registration

   This specification registers an event package, based on the
   registration procedures defined in RFC 3265 [8].  The following is
   the information required for such a registration:
   Package Name: conference
   Package or Template-Package: This is a package.
   Published Document: RFC XXXX (Note to RFC Editor: Please fill in XXXX
      with the RFC number of this specification).

      Macintosh file type code: "TEXT"
   Personal and email address for further information: Jonathan
      Rosenberg, <jdrosen@jdrosen.net>
   Intended usage: COMMON
   Author/Change controller: The IETF

9.3  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info

   This section registers a new XML namespace, as per the guidelines in
   RFC 3688 [14].

   URI: The URI for this namespace is
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info
   Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING working group, <sipping@ietf.org>,
      Jonathan Rosenberg <jdrosen@jdrosen.net>
   XML:

9.4  XML Schema Registration

   This specification registers a schema, as per the guidelines in RFC
   3688 [14].
      URI: please assign
      Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING Working Group
      (sipping@ietf.org), Jonathan Rosenberg (jdrosen@jdrosen.net)
      XML: The XML can be found as the sole content of Section 6

9.5  URI Purposes Sub-registry Establishment

   This document instructs the IANA to create a new sub-registry "URI
   purposes" under the already existing registry:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

   The purpose of a URI is an XML element, encoded in the conference
   event package [RFC XXXX - substitute with the number assigned to this
   draft].  The value of the <purpose> element indicates the intended
   usage of the URI in the context of the conference event package and
   is defined in sections Section 5.2.5 and Section 5.2.6 of this
   specification.

   This sub-registry is defined as a table that contains the following
   three columns:

   Value: The token under registration
   Description: A descriptive text defining the intended usage of the
      URI
   Document: A reference to the document defining the registration

   This specification instructs IANA to create the table with the
   initial content as defined below:

   Value         Description                         Document
   -------       ----------------------------------  ----------

   participation The URI can be used to join the     [RFC XXXX]
                 conference

   streaming     The URI can be used to access the   [RFC XXXX]
                 streamed conference data

   event         The URI can be used to subscribe    [RFC XXXX]
                 to the conference event package

   recording     The URI can be used to access the   [RFC XXXX]
                 recorded conference data

   web-page      The URI can be used to access a     [RFC XXXX]
                 web page that contains additional
                 information of the conference


   New values of the "URI purposes" are registered by the IANA when a
   specification becomes available and according to the definition of
   RFC 2434 [9].  The IANA Considerations section of the specification
   MUST include the following information:

   Value: The value of the <purpose> element to be registered
   Description: A short description of the intended usage of the URI
