1.  Introduction

   This specification outlines the "publish" link relation and what it
   means to publish something.  The specification will register the
   relation according to [RFC5988].

   No assumptions will be made about which media type the target IRI
   will accept, but some examples and guidelines will be given.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Editorial Note (to be removed by RFC Editor)

   Please discuss this draft on the apps-discuss@ietf.org mailing list.

2.  Publishing

   What does it mean to publish something?  In effect it can be
   interpreted as making something available for general consumption.

   A newspaper can publish an article, then it can be read by
   'everyone'.

   A publisher can publish a book, so it can be read.

   A video can be submitted to youtube so it can be watched.

Internet-Draft      The 'publish' Link Relation Type        January 2014


2.1.  The 'publish' link relation

   The "publish" link relation allows a resource to be published using
   the target IRI.

   Clients SHOULD use an appropriate write method of the target IRI
   protocol uniform interface.

   Servers MAY ignore the request to publish something if the resource
   URI is already published.

   Examples can be found in Appendix A

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the link relation "publish", as per
   [RFC5988]

   Relation Name:

   publish

   Description:

   Allows resources to be published using the target IRI.

   Reference:

   [ this document ]

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD

5.  Acknowledgements

   Using Atompub ([RFC5023]), a Client would have to GET each entry
   using it's "edit" relation and PUT each back with

     <app:draft>no</app:draft>

   being the only change in both entries.

   This is highly inefficient.  So let us find a better way.

A.1.  Publishing multiple resources

   To be able to publish many resources at once we need a representation
   which allows this.

   Appendix A in [RFC2169] defines the "text/uri-list" media type.

   Extra linefeeds are for display purposes only.

     POST /publish
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: text/uri-list

     http://example.org/item/1\r\n
     http://example.org/item/2\r\n

   The problem with this approach is that is is a separate resource, and
   will not invalidate the caches of the feed.  This problem is also
   apparent in the single item approach.

   One might mediate this by making the feed resource also accept "text/
   uri-list" for publishing.

   We could then change the request to this:

     POST /feed
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: text/uri-list

     http://example.org/item/1\r\n
     http://example.org/item/2\r\n
