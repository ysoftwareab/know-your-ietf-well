Abstract

   This draft proposes unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fast
   handovers.  For efficient network communication, it is vital for a
   protocol layer to know or utilize other layer's information such as a
   form of L2 triggers.  However, each protocol layer is basically
   designed independently.  Since each protocol layer is also
   implemented independently in current operating systems, it is very
   hard to exchange control information between protocol layers.  This
   draft defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of
   "primitives" to achieve fast handovers in the network layer as a
   means of solving the problem.  This mechanism is called "L3-driven
   fast handovers" because the network layer initiates L2 and L3
   handovers by using the "primitives".  This document is a product of
   the IP Mobility Optimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Recent years have witnessed the rapid proliferation of wireless
   networks as well as mobile devices accessing them.  Unlike wired
   network environments, wireless networks are characterized by
   dynamically changing radio conditions, connectivity, and available
   bandwidth.  For efficient network communication, it is vital for a
   protocol layer to know or utilize other layer's control information.
   Mobile IPv4 [1] and Mobile IPv6 [2] have been standardized to support
   communication with mobile nodes.  There are several proposals for
   seamless handovers in IPv6 networks such as Fast Handovers for Mobile
   IPv6 (FMIPv6) [3] and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [4].  In
   FMIPv6, the network layer must know in advance the indication of a
   handover from the link layer to achieve seamless handovers.  However,
   control information exchange between protocol layers is typically not
   available because each protocol layer is designed independently.

   To solve the problem, this draft defines nine kinds of L2
   abstractions in the form of "primitives" to achieve fast handovers in
   the network layer.  This mechanism is called "L3-driven fast
   handovers" because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by
   using the "primitives".

   IEEE 802.21 [5] also defines several services that make use of L2
   information.  For the sake of ease of implementation and deployment,
   the primitives defined in this document make use of only the
   information available in the mobile node, while IEEE 802.21
   introduces the information server in the network to provide the
   mobile node with network-related information such as a global network
   map.

   This document represents the consensus of the MobOpts Research Group.
   It has been reviewed by Research Group members active in the specific
   area of work.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms.


   L3-Driven Fast Handover

      The handover mechanism that is initiated by the network layer on a
      mobile node.  Since this mechanism allows handover preparation in
      L3 before the start of an L2 handover on the mobile node, it can
      reduce packet loss during a handover.  The L3-driven fast handover
      mechanism requires L2 information as a trigger for a handover
      procedure.


   PoA

      The point of attachment of a mobile node. (e.g., an access point
      in IEEE 802.11 networks.)


   Primitive

      A unit of information that is sent from one layer to another.
      There are four classes of primitives: Request, Confirm, Indication
      and Response.  One or more classes of a primitive are exchanged
      depending on the type of primitive.

3.  Primitives for L2 Abstractions

   Each layer offers its services in the form of primitives.  Four
   classes of primitives are defined as shown in Figure 1.  Request is
   issued by the layer that wants to get the services or the information
   from another layer, and Confirm is the acknowledgment of the request.
   Indication is the notification of the information to the layer that
   requested the service, and Response is the acknowledgment of the
   indication.  In this architecture, communication between layers is
   symmetrical.


   -------------------------   -----------------------------
             Request                       Response
               ||      /\             /\      ||
   Layer N     ||      ||             ||      ||
   ------------||------||---   -------||------||------------
               ||      ||             ||      ||
               \/      ||             ||      \/
   Layer N-m        Confirm       Indication
   -------------------------   -----------------------------

                Figure 1: Interaction Model between Layers


   The primitive consists of five fields: protocol layer ID, protocol
   ID, primitive class (Request, Response, Indication, or Confirm),
   primitive name, and parameters.  The protocol layer ID specifies to
   which layer this primitive should be sent, e.g., Layer 2 or Layer 3.
   The protocol ID specifies to which protocol entity this primitive
   should be sent, e.g., IEEE802.11 or IEEE802.3.

   For unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fast handovers, three
   different usages of "Primitives" are defined as described below:

   Type 1.  To provide L2 information to upper layers immediately

            This type of primitive is used to provide the L2 information
            to upper layers immediately.  The "Request" and "Confirm"
            classes of primitives MUST be exchanged for the interaction.
            The "Request" primitive is for an acquisition request for
            the L2 information.  The "Confirm" primitive is for the
            answer.

   Type 2.  To notify upper layers of L2 events asynchronously

            This type of primitive is used to notify upper layers of L2
            events asynchronously.  The "Request", "Confirm" and

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2008


            "Indication" classes of primitive MUST be exchanged and the
            "Response" class MAY be exchanged for the interaction.  The
            "Request" and "Confirm" primitives are used just for
            registration.  When an event occurs, the "Indication"
            primitive is asynchronously delivered to the upper layer.

   Type 3.  To control L2 actions from upper layers

            This type of primitive is used to control L2 actions from
            upper layers.  The "Request" and "Confirm" classes of
            primitives MUST be exchanged for the interaction.  The
            "Request" primitive is a request for operation.  Ack or nack
            returns immediately as the "Confirm" primitive.

   A protocol entity can register primitives anytime by exchanging the
   Request and Confirm messages that include the fields defined above.
   When the registered event occurs, the Indication and Response
   messages are exchanged as well.

   The way to exchange a message between protocol entities is beyond the
   scope of this document.  Any information exchange method between
   layers such as the work [6] can be used.

   The timing for sending an Indication primitive is also beyond the
   scope of this document.  For example, a layer 2 event is generated
   when layer 2 status has been changed and this depends upon how
   scanning algorithms, for example, are implemented.

4.  Definitions of Primitives

   To obtain and exchange L2 information, the following Primitives are
   defined.  Appendix C shows example mapping between the L2 primitives
   and the primitives in IEEE802.11 and IEEE802.16e.

4.1.  L2-LinkStatus (Type 1)

   The L2-LinkStatus.request primitive is sent to the link layer when an
   upper layer requires the current information of a link.  The L2-
   LinkStatus.request primitive contains the "Network Interface ID"
   parameter (See Section 5.1).  In response, the L2-LinkStatus.confirm
   primitive returns.  The L2-LinkStatus.confirm primitive contains
   three parameters: "Network Interface ID", "PoA", and "Condition".
   "PoA" and "Condition" indicate the current status of the link between
   the mobile node and a PoA.

4.2.  L2-PoAList (Type 1)

   The L2-PoAList.request primitive is sent to the link layer when an
   upper layer requires a list of the candidate PoAs.  The L2-
   PoAList.request primitive contains the "Network Interface ID"
   parameter.  In response, the L2-PoAList.confirm primitive returns the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter and the "PoA List" parameter.  The
   "PoA List" parameter is a list of the candidate PoAs.

4.3.  L2-PoAFound (Type 2)

   The L2-PoAFound.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when new PoAs are detected.  This primitive carries the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter and the "PoA List" parameter.  The
   "PoA List" parameter contains information on new PoAs detected by the
   mobile node.  In order to use this notification, the registration
   process using the L2-PoAFound.request primitive and the L2-
   PoAFound.confirm primitive is needed in advance.  The L2-
   PoAFound.request primitive has two parameters: "Network Interface ID"
   and "Enable/Disable".  The "Enable/Disable" parameter shows whether
   this notification function is turned on.  When this registration
   succeeds, the L2-PoAFound.confirm primitive returns with the "Network
   Interface ID" parameter and the "Ack" parameter in response.

4.4.  L2-PoALost (Type 2)

   The L2-PoALost.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when a PoA included in the list of candidate PoAs
   disappears.  This primitive carries the "Network Interface ID"
   parameter and the "PoA List" parameter.  The "PoA List" parameter
   contains information on the PoAs that disappeared from the candidates

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2008


   list.  The registration process using the L2-PoALost.request
   primitive and the L2-PoALost.confirm primitive is similar to the L2-
   PoAFound primitive described above.

4.5.  L2-LinkUp (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkUp.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when a new link is connected and IP packets can be
   transmitted through the new link.  As described in RFC 4957 [7], what
   "link is connected" means depends on link types.  For example, in
   case of the infrastructure mode in IEEE802.11 (WiFi), this primitive
   is provided when an association to an access point is established.
   This primitive carries the "Network Interface ID" parameter and the
   "PoA" parameter.  The L2-LinkUp.request primitive contains the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter and the "Enable/Disable" parameter
   for registration.  When the registration succeeds, the L2-
   LinkUp.confirm primitive with the "Network Interface ID" parameter
   and the "Ack" parameter returns.

4.6.  L2-LinkDown (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkDown.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when an existing link is disconnected and IP packets
   cannot be transmitted through the link.  The registration processing
   is same as the L2-LinkUp primitive described above.

4.7.  L2-LinkStatusChanged (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkStatusChanged.indication primitive is asynchronously
   provided to an upper layer when the status of a link has changed.
   This notification contains three parameters: "Network Interface ID",
   "PoA", and "Condition".  The "PoA" parameter indicates the attachment
   point at which the link quality changed.  In the registration
   processing, the L2-LinkStatusChanged.request primitive carries the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter, the "Enable/Disable" parameter, and
   the "Condition" parameter.  "Condition" indicates the event type and
   the threshold for the indication.

4.8.  L2-LinkConnect (Type 3)

   The L2-LinkConnect.request primitive is sent to the link layer when
   an upper layer has to establish a new link to the specific "PoA".
   This primitive carries the "Network Interface ID" parameter and the
   "PoA" parameter.  This operation begins after the link layer returns
   the L2-LinkConnect.confirm primitive with "Ack".

4.9.  L2-LinkDisconnect (Type 3)

   The L2-LinkDisconnect.request primitive is sent to the link layer
   when an upper layer has to tear down an existing link to the specific
   "PoA".  This primitive carries the "Network Interface ID" parameter
   and the "PoA" parameter.  This operation begins after the link layer
   returns the L2-LinkDisconnect.confirm primitive with "Ack".

5.  Definitions of Static Parameters

   This section lists static parameters.  Once the values of static
   parameters are configured, they basically remain unchanged during
   communication.  The following parameters are transferred as a part of
   primitives.

5.1.  Network Interface ID

   The "Network interface ID" parameter uniquely identifies the network
   interface in the node.  The syntax of the identifier is
   implementation-specific (e.g., name, index or unique address assigned
   to each interface).  This parameter also contains the network
   interface type which indicates the kind of technology of the network
   interface (e.g., IEEE802.11a/b/g, 3GPP, etc.).  This parameter is
   required in all primitives.

6.  Definitions of Dynamic Parameters

   This section lists dynamic parameters.  The values of dynamic
   parameters change frequently during communication.  The following
   parameters are transferred as a part of primitives.

6.1.  PoA (Point of Attachment)

   The "PoA" parameter uniquely identifies the PoA.

6.2.  Condition

   The "Condition" parameter consists of the following sub-parameters:
   available bandwidth and link quality level.  These sub-parameters are
   the abstracted information that indicates the current quality-of
   service.  The abstraction algorithms of sub-parameters depend on
   hardware devices and software implementation.  The useful range of
   link quality is divided into five levels: EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, BAD,
   NONE in descending order.  The quality levels of a L2 device are
   independent of those of other devices.  However, Making decisions
   based on these metrics is error prone and not guaranteed to result in
   optimal choice of links.  An example of the thresholds among the five
   levels in IEEE802.11 is described in Appendix E.

6.3.  PoA List

   The "PoA List" parameter consists of arbitrary couples of two sub-
   parameters: "PoA" and "Condition".  This parameter shows a list of
   PoAs and their conditions.

6.4.  Enable/Disable

   The "Enable/Disable" flag is used for turning event notification on/
   off.  When an upper layer needs notifications, the "Request"
   primitive with "Enable" is sent to the link layer as registration.
   When an upper layer needs no more notifications, the "Request"
   primitive with "Disable" is sent.

6.5.  Ack/Error

   When an upper layer requests some notifications, the link layer
   receives and confirms this "Request".  If the "Request" is valid, the

7.  Architectural Considerations

   RFC 4907 [8] discusses the role and the issues of link indications
   within the Internet Architecture.  This section discusses the
   architectural considerations mentioned in Section 2 of RFC 4907.


   [1]   Proposals should avoid use of simplified link models in
         circumstances where they do not apply.

         The information in each layer should be abstracted before it is
         sent to another layer.  For example, in IEEE 802.11, the
         Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), the number of
         retransmissions and existence of association between the mobile
         node and the access point are used so that the link layer
         indications can adjust themselves to various environments or
         situations.  The thresholds needed for some link indications
         are defined from empirical study.

         In the conventional protocol layering model, the Protocol
         Entity (PE) is defined as the entity that processes a specific
         protocol.  Our proposal introduced the Abstract Entity (AE) to
         achieve link independency of the link indications.  An AE and a
         PE make a pair.  An AE abstracts the PE-dependent information
         to the PE-independent information.

         Figure 2 shows AEs and PEs using primitives.


   [2]   Link indications should be clearly defined, so that it is
         understood when they are generated on different link layers.

         To make the link information/indications clear, our proposal
         defines the 4 types of primitives: request/confirm and
         indication/response as described in Section 3.  The request is
         used to obtain the information of another layer.  The confirm
         is the reply to the request and it includes the requested
         information.  The indication is generated when a particular
         event occurs.  The response is the reply to the indication.

         In our proposal on IEEE 802.11b, L2-LinkUp is defined as the
         status in which an association to the AP is established, and
         L2-LinkDown is defined as the status in which an association to
         the AP is not established.  L2-LinkStatusChanged is generated
         when the link quality goes below the predefined threshold.
         Since the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the
         number of retransmissions are used to abstract and evaluate the
         link quality, L2-LinkStatusChanged represents the link quality



Teraoka, et al.          Expires August 5, 2008                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2008


         in both directions.  It should use an average of RSSI or the
         number of retransmissions damped for one second or more to cope
         with transient link conditions.


   [3]   Proposals must demonstrate robustness against misleading
         indications.

         Since RSSI changes significantly even when the mobile node
         stands still according to the measurements in our experiments,
         our proposal uses the RSSI, the number of retransmissions, and
         the existence of an association to calculate the link status as
         described above.  In our experiments, there were some "ping-
         pong" handovers between two APs.  Such ping-pong handovers
         could be reduced by detecting the most suitable AP by L2-
         LinkStatus when L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified.  The use of
         L2 indications is related to parameter thresholds which trigger
         handover.  These thresholds vary based on the deployment
         scenario, and if not configured properly, could lead to
         misleading indications.


   [4]   Upper layers should utilize a timely recovery step so as to
         limit the potential damage from link indications determined to
         be invalid after they have been acted on.

         The proposed L3-driven handover described in Appendix E uses
         the L2-LinkStatusChanged indication as the trigger for starting
         handover.  L2-LinkStatusChanged is indicated when the link
         quality goes below a specific threshold.  This indication is
         not canceled even if the link quality goes up soon.  As
         described above, L2-LinkStatus can be used to detect the most
         suitable AP.  The IP layer can cancel a handover if it finds
         that the current AP is the most suitable one by using L2-
         LinkStatus when L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified.


   [5]   Proposals must demonstrate that effective congestion control is
         maintained.

         Since this mechanism is coupled to the IP layer, and not
         directly to the transport layer, the proposed mechanism does
         not directly affect congestion control.

   [6]   Proposals must demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed
         optimizations.

         In IPv6 mobility, the L3-driven handover mechanism using link
         indications can dramatically reduce gap time due to handover.
         The L3-driven handover mechanism needs the L2-LinkStatusChanged
         indication to predict disconnection.  But L2-LinkStatusChanged
         sometimes is not trusted because it is difficult to abstract
         the link quality.  Invalid L2-LinkStatusChanged may cause
         redundant handover.  A handover mechanism using only L2-LinkUp/
         L2-LinkDown can also reduce gap time modestly.  An example of
         an implementation and evaluation of the L3-driven handover
         mechanism is described in Appendix E.


   [7]   Link indications should not be required by upper layers, in
         order to maintain link independence.

         Our proposal does not require any modifications to the
         transport and upper layers.


   [8]   Proposals should avoid race conditions, which can occur where
         link indications are utilized directly by multiple layers of
         the stack.

         Since our proposal defines the link indications only to the IP
         layer, race conditions between multiple layers never occur.


   [9]   Proposals should avoid inconsistencies between link and routing
         layer metrics.

         Our proposal does not deal with routing metrics.


   [10]  Overhead reduction schemes must avoid compromising
         interoperability and introducing link layer dependencies into
         the Internet and Transport layers.

         As described above, the link indications in our proposal are
         abstracted to the information independent of link types to
         reduce the gap time due to a handover, and the ordinary host
         can execute handover without using the link indications defined
         in our proposal.

   [11]  Proposals advocating the transport of link indications beyond
         the local host need to carefully consider the layering,
         security and transport implications.  In general, implicit
         signals are preferred to explicit transport of link indications
         since they add no new packets in times of network distress,
         operate more reliably in the presence of middle boxes such as
         NA(P)Ts, are more likely to be backward compatible, and are
         less likely to result in security vulnerabilities.

         Our proposal does not define exchange of link indications
         between nodes.

8.  Security Considerations

   RFC 4907 [8] discusses the role and the issues of link indications
   within the Internet Architecture.  This section discusses the
   security considerations mentioned in Section 4 of RFC 4907.


   [1]  Spoofing

        The proposed primitives suffer from spoofed link layer control
        frames.  For example, if a malicious access point is set up and
        spoofed beacon frames are transmitted, L2-PoAFound.indication is
        generated in the mobile node.  As a result, the mobile node may
        establish an association with the malicious access point by L2-
        LinkConnect.request.


   [2]  Indication validation

        Transportation of the link indications between nodes is not
        assumed, hence this consideration is beyond the scope of our
        proposal.


   [3]  Denial of service

        Since this proposal does not change link layer protocols, no
        more insecurity is added to a particular link layer protocol.
        However, the proposed primitives suffer from denial of service
        attack by spoofed link layer frames.  For example, L2-
        PoAFound.indication and L2-PoALost.indication may frequently be
        generated alternately if a malicious access point frequently
        transmits control frames that indicate strong RSSI and weak RSSI
        alternately.

   First, L3 issues LinkUp.request to receive LinkUp.indication when the
   link becomes available.  L3 also issues LinkStatusChanged.request to
   receive LinkStatusChanged.indication when the link quality goes below
   below the threshold.

   In the beginning of the L3-driven handover procedure, L2 detects that
   the radio signal strength is going down.  Then L2 sends L2-
   LinkStatusChanged.indication to L3.  L3 prepares for handover (e.g.,
   CoA generation, DAD, ND cache creation, and routing table setting)
   and sends L2-PoAList.request to L2 if the list of access points is
   needed.

   If L3 decides to perform handover according to some rules, L3 sends
   L2-LinkConnect.request with some parameters about candidate access
   points to request L2 handover.  L2 handover begins after L3 sends L2-
   LinkConnect.confirm to L2.  When the L2 handover finishes, L2 sends
   L2-LinkUp.indication to notify L3.  Finally, L3 performs handover
   (e.g., sending BU).

   One of the important features of L3-driven fast handover using
   Primitives is that L3 handover preparation can be done during
   communication.  So, it can reduce disruption time during handover.

   When MN establishes link connectivity to PAR, it performs router
   discovery.  MN sends RtSolPr message to PAR to resolve the access
   point identifiers to the subnet router information.  To send RtSolPr,

   MN discovers one or more access points by sending L2-PoAList.request
   to the link layer.  As a response to L2-PoAList.request, L2-
   PoAList.confirm returns with "PoA List" parameter which contains
   identifiers and conditions of nearby access points.  After initial AP
   discovery, L2-PoAFound.indication with "PoA List" is also sent from
   the link layer when one or more access points are discovered.

   When the link layer of MN detects that radio signal strength is
   dropping, it sends L2-LinkStatusChanged.indication to the network
   layer.  Then, MN sends the FBU message to PAR as the beginning of the
   L3 handover procedure.  The NCoA required for the FBU message is
   determined according to the MN's policy database and the received
   PrRtAdv message.  As a response to the FBU message, MN receives the
   FBack message and then immediately switches its link by L2-
   LinkConnect.request with the specific "PoA" parameter.  The handover
   policy of the MN is outside the scope of this document.

   After L2 handover, the link layer of the MN sends L2-
   LinkUp.indication to the network layer.  MN immediately sends the FNA
   message to NAR.  NAR will send tunneled and buffered packets to MN.

   link switching mechanism.

   MN sends the FBack message to both AR (not only PAR but also NAR), MN

B.3.  Experiment

   We implemented FMIPv6 and the proposed L2 primitives on FreeBSD-5.4.
   Figure 6 shows our test network.  MN is connected to access routers
   by using IEEE802.11a wireless LAN.  MN moves from PAR to NAR.

   Scenario 1 was used in this experiment since it was more stable than
   scenario 2.  Upon receiving L2-LinkStatusChanged.indication, L3 of MN
   sends the FBU message and then receives the FBack message.  It took
   20ms from the transmission of the FBU message to the reception of the
   FBack message.  After receiving the FBack message, L3 of MN issues
   L2-LinkConnect.request to L2.  When L2 handover finishes, L3 receives
   L2-LinkUp.ind from L2.  It took 1ms for an L2 handover.  Next, MN
   sends the FNA message to NAR.  Upon receiving the FNA message, NAR
   starts forwarding packets to NM.  ICMP echo request packets were sent
   at 10ms intervals.  It was observed that no or one ICMP echo reply
   packet was lost during a handover.

Appendix D.  Example Mapping of Primitives and IEEE802.11

   This section shows examples of the mapping between "Primitives" and
   IEEE802.11 parameters.

D.1.  L2-LinkStatus

   Most of parameters of L2-LinkStatus are related to the configuration
   of network interface hardware.  The operating system and the device
   driver module can easily collect such information.  However, to
   create the "Condition" parameter, the MN should maintain statistics
   and parameters related to the current wireless environment.

   There are two sub-parameters of the "Condition" parameter: available
   bandwidth and link quality level.  The available bandwidth of the
   current PoA can be obtained by maintaining the transmission rate
   indication and the statistics of frame transmission every time a
   frame is sent.  A link quality level can be updated by maintaining
   the following parameters and statistics every time a frame is
   received: receive signal strength indication (RSSI), transmission/
   reception rate indication, transmit/receive latency, bit error rate,
   frame error rate and noise level.  Link quality level is divided into
   five levels: EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, BAD, and NONE in descending
   order.  Some parameters can be managed by setting thresholds from
   software.  When the parameters cross the threshold, an interrupt is
   generated for the software.

D.2.  L2-PoAList

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PoAList returns the detected APs whose
   quality level exceeds the specified threshold for PoA candidates (by
   the "PoA List" parameter).  Therefore, MN should always maintain the
   database of available access points according to reception of beacon
   frame, probe response frame and all frames.  This AP database is
   managed in consideration of time, number of frames and signal
   strength.  There are some kinds of network interface hardware that
   can notify events to operating system only when the desired event
   occurs, by setting a threshold from software.  Moreover, MN can
   transmit the probe request frame for access point discovery, if
   needed.

D.3.  L2-PoAFound

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PoAFound is notified when new PoAs whose
   link quality level exceeds the specified threshold are detected by
   listening beacons or scanning APs.  If the received frame (mainly the
   beacon or the probe response) is not in the AP database described in
   Appendix D.2, then the link layer creates L2-PoAFound.indication.

   For example, if the threshold of link quality level specified by L2-
   PoAFound.request is GOOD, L2-PoAFound.ind is created and sent to the
   upper layer when PoA's link quality becomes better than GOOD.

D.4.  L2-PoALost

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PoALost is notified when an AP included
   in the list of candidate APs is lost by listening beacons or scanning
   APs.  If the entry in the AP database described in Appendix D.2
   expires, or link quality level goes under the threshold, then the
   link layer creates L2-PoALost.indication.  To calculate the link
   quality level, the signal strength of the received frame (mainly the
   beacon or the probe response) can be used.  For example, if the
   threshold of the link quality specified by L2-PoALost is BAD, L2-
   PoALost.ind is created and sent to the upper layer when PoA's link
   quality becomes worse than BAD.

D.5.  L2-LinkUp

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkUp is notified when association or
   reassociation event occurs.  When such event occurs, MN receives the
   association response frame or the reassociation response frame.
   Immediately after receiving it, the link layer creates L2-
   LinkUp.indication.

D.6.  L2-LinkDown

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkDown is notified when a
   disassociation event occurs or when no beacon is received during a
   certain time.  When such event occurs, MN sends the disassociation
   frame to AP, or the entry of the specific AP is deleted from the AP
   database described in Appendix D.2.  By detecting such events, the
   link layer creates L2-LinkDown.indication.

D.7.  L2-LinkStatusChanged

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified when the
   radio signal strength of the connected AP drops below the specified
   threshold.

D.8.  L2-LinkConnect

   In IEEE802.11 networks, each AP is identified by the BSSID and the
   service set of several APs is identified by the SSID.  When L2-
   LinkConnect is used to connect a specific AP or a service set, the
   link layer should set the BSSID or the SSID.  Also, the channel
   should be set appropriately at the same time by searching the
   database described in Appendix D.2.  To connect to AP, MN should be

   authenticated by AP.  MN sends the authentication message to AP, and
   then MN sends the association message to associate with AP.

D.9.  L2-LinkDisconnect

   In IEEE802.11 networks, MN sends the disassociation message to AP for
   disconnection.  When L2-LinkDisconnect is used for disconnection from
   the current AP, the link layer should send the disassociation message
   to the appropriate AP, and stop data transmission.

Appendix E.  Implementation and Evaluation of the Proposed Model

   This section describes an implementation of the proposed link
   indication architecture and its evaluation.

   An IEEE802.11a wireless LAN device driver was modified to provide
   abstract link layer information in the form of primitives defined in
   Section 4.  The modified driver has two AP lists.  One contains the
   device-dependent information such as RSSI, retransmission count,
   various AP parameters and various statistics.  The device-dependent
   information except for the AP parameters is updated whenever the
   device receives a frame.  If the received frame is the management
   frame, the AP parameters are also updated according to the parameters
   in the frame.

   Another AP list contains the abstract information.  The abstract
   information is updated periodically by using the device-dependent
   information.  In the abstraction processing, for example, RSSI or the
   retransmission count is converted to the common indicator "link
   quality".  In our outdoor testbed described below, the thresholds of
   the RSSI value between the link quality levels were defined as
   follows:

   o  EXCELLENT -- 34 -- GOOD

   o  GOOD -- 27 -- FAIR

   o  FIAR -- 22 -- BAD

   o  BAD -- 15 -- NONE

   L2-PoAList and L2-LinkStatus were implemented by using only the
   abstract information.  Thus, the upper layers can use information of
   the current AP and the adjacent APs without depending on the devices.
   L2-PoAFound or L2-PoALost is notified if the link quality rises or
   falls beyond the thresholds when the abstract information is updated.
   If the link quality of the current AP goes below the specific
   threshold, L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified.  L2-LinkUp or L2-
   LinkDown is notified when an association with an AP is established or
   destroyed.  To realize L2-LinkConnect and L2-LinkDisconnect,
   functions to connect or disconnect to the specified AP were
   implemented.  In these functions, since only abstract information is
   needed to specify the AP, other layers need not know the device-
   dependent information.

   In our outdoor testbed, there are eight ARs located at 80-100m
   intervals.  AP is collocated at AR.  IEEE802.11a was used as the link
   layer.  The same wireless channel was used at all APs.  Thus there

   are eight wireless IPv6 subnets in the testbed.  The mobile node was
   in a car moving at a speed of 30-40 km/h.  When link quality of the
   current AP goes down, the mobile node executes L3-driven handover
   described in Appendix A.  An application called DVTS was running on
   the mobile node and sent digital video data at a data rate of about
   15Mbps through the wireless IPv6 subnet to the correspondent node,
   which replayed received digital video data.  In this environment, the
   L2 handover required less than 1 msec and mobility protocol LIN6 [9]
   required a few msec for location registration.  Thus, the total gap
   time due to the handover was 3-4 msec.  In most cases, there was no
   effect on the replayed pictures due to handover.

Appendix F.  Changes from 05

   o  In Section 6.2, the following sentence was added.

         However, making decisions based on these metrics is error prone
         and not guaranteed to result in optimal choice of links.
