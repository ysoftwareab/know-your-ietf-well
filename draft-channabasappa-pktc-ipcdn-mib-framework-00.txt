         Abstract 
         This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)  
         for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.   
         In particular, it provides information on the management requirements  
         of PacketCable(TM)/IPCablecom specific devices and defines a framework  
         in which PacketCable MIBs are defined. This document does not precede  
         any previously issued document. It is, however,  intended to support and  
         complement the actual Packetcable MIB documents, which are issued  
         separately.

         Specification Language 
          
         Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the  
         significance of particular requirements are capitalized. These words  
         are: 
          
         "MUST          -  This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the  
         item is an absolute requirement of this specification.  
          
         "MUST NOT"     -  This phrase means that the item is an absolute  
         prohibition of this specification.  
          
         "SHOULD"      -  This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that  
         there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore  
         this item, but the full implications should be understood and the case  
         carefully weighed before choosing a different course.  
          
         "SHOULD NOT"   - This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons  
         in particular circumstances when the listed behavior is acceptable or  
         event useful, but the full implications should be understood and the  
         case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with  
         this label.  
          
         "MAY"          - This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this  
         item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item  
         because a particular marketplace requires it or because it enhances the  
         product, for example; another vendor may omit the same item.

         Internet Draft       Packetcable MTA MIB             June 4, 2002 


          
          
          
          
          
          
         1. Introduction and scope 
          
         This document addresses aspects of the voice communication capabilities  
         and the related network management requirements of a PacketCable  
         network. It defines a framework for categorizing the capabilities and  
         addressing the requirements and the resulting MIBs to be implemented by  
         elements of a Packetcable network. 
          
         The MIB design itself follows the multi-phase schedule as the rest of  
         the PacketCable specifications.  MIBs that are developed for  
         PacketCable 1.x support embedded and Standalone MTAs and provide  
         definitions for call signaling and MTA provisioning functions. Future  
         PacketCable development phases will include other functional areas as  
         well as requirements for other PacketCable components. Table 1  
         illustrates the areas covered by Packetcable 1.x and provides a glimpse  
         of the areas that would be considered later. Refer to Section 8 of this  
         document for a brief explanation of some of the areas mentioned.

         Internet Draft       Packetcable MTA MIB             June 4, 2002 


          
          
          
          
          
          
          
         However, it is to be noted that the legal/regulatory classification of  
         IP-based voice communications provided over cable networks or  
         otherwise, and the legal/regulatory obligations, if any, borne by  
         providers of such voice communications, are not yet fully defined by  
         appropriate legal and regulatory authorities. Nothing in this  
         specification is addressed to, or intended to affect, those issues. In  
         particular, while this document uses standard terms such as "call,"     
         "call signaling," "telephony," etc., it is evident from this document  
         and appropriate references [ REFERENCES ] that while a Packet-Cable  
         network performs activities analogous to corresponding PSTN functions,  
         the manner by which it does so differs considerably from the manner in  
         which they are performed in the PSTN telecommunications carriers.   
         These differences may be significant for legal/regulatory purposes. 
          
          
          
          
         2. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

         Limiting the flow of information from the resources of a system only to  
         authorized persons, programs, processes, or other system resources on a  
         network. 
          
         Active 
         ------ 
         A service flow is said to be "active" when it is permitted to forward  
         data  packets. A service flow must first be admitted before it is  
         active.  
          
         Admitted 
         -------- 
         A service flow is said to be "admitted" when the CMTS has reserved  
         resources (e.g., bandwidth) for it on the DOCSIS network.  
          
         Authentication 
         -------------- 
         The process of verifying the claimed identity of an entity to another  
         entity.   
          
          
         Digital certificate 
         ------- ----------- 
         A binding between an entity's public key and one or more attributes  
         relating to its identity, also known as a public key certificate.

         Digital signature  
         ------- --------- 
         A data value generated by a public-key algorithm based on the  
         contents of a block of data and a private key, yielding an  
         individualized cryptographic checksum. 
          
          
          
         Downstream 
         ----------

         Flow [DOCSIS Flow] 
         ------------------ 
         A unidirectional sequence of packets associated with a Service ID and a  
         QoS.  Multiple multimedia streams may be carried in a single DOCSIS  
         Flow. Also known as a DOCSIS-QoS "service flow") 
          
          
         Flow [IP Flow] 
         -------------- 
         A unidirectional sequence of packets identified by OSI Layer 3 and  
         Layer 4  
         header information. This information includes source/destination IP   
         addresses, source/destination port numbers, protocol ID. Multiple  
         multimedia streams may be carried in a single IP Flow. 
          
         Gateway 
         ------- 
         Devices bridging between the PacketCable IP Voice Communication world  
         and the PSTN. Examples are the Media Gateway, which provides the bearer  
         circuit interfaces to the PSTN and transcodes the media stream, and the  
         Signaling Gateway, which sends and receives circuit switched network  
         signaling to the edge of the PacketCable network. 
           
         Header 
         ------ 
         Protocol control information located at the beginning of a protocol  
         data  
         unit.

         6. Guidelines and General Management Requirements. 
          
           6.1 MIB Framework GuideLines. 
               The following guidelines were considered in designing the  
               Packetcable MIB framework: 
             
         -    PacketCable MIBs MUST comply with SMIv2 as specified in  
            [21] and related documents. 
            
          
         -    Packetcable MIBs MUST support both embedded and standalone  
            MTAs. 
          
          
         -    A minimalist approach MUST be taken while designing the  
            PacketCable MIBs, i.e., if other MIBs define the same  
            functions, then those MIBs should be reused rather than  
            creating new ones. 
          
          
            6.2 Packetcable Device Requirements 
               The following requirements are imposed by Packetcable on  
               participant devices, specifically: 
          
         -    The components pertaining to the data part of a PacketCable  
            1.x network ( CM, CMTS ) must be compliant with DOCSIS 1.1    
            and hence MUST support DOCSIS 1.1 MIBs.  Refer to [6] and [7]     
            for more information on DOCSIS MIBs. 
          
         -    DOCSIS 1.1 devices within a PacketCable network require  
            support of  SNMPv3 and all end-devices implementing  
            Packetcable MIBs MUST be SNMPv3 compliant as depicted in [19]  
            and related documents. 
              
             6.3 Business Management Guidelines 
                 The framework also considered, as a business management         
                 guideline, the following: 
          
          
                  A single physical device (e.g., embedded-MTA) will be  
                  completely provisioned and managed by a single business  
                  entity. In the case of multiple service providers offering  
                  different services on the same device (e.g., data by one    
                  provider, voice by another provider), a secondary service  
                  provider will act as the  "contractor" for the primary   
                  provider in the areas of device provisioning and management.

             6.4 Support for Embedded and Standalone MTAs 
          
                 The PacketCable MIBs will provide features for both embedded  
                 and standalone MTAs. Standalone MTAs are not required to  
                 include any DOCSIS related functions and hence the PacketCable  
                 MIBs should be able to provide management support for voice  
                 communications functionalities using a standalone MTA device  
                 that does not have DOCSIS as a base.  
          
             6.5 MIB Layering 
                 Figure 2 below describes the MIB layering model. The two stacks   
                 represent the packet network and analog voice sections of the  
                 MTA. On the packet network side MIB layering follows the same  
                 layering model as the protocol stacks.

         7 SNMP Considerations 
           SNMPv3 provides an extended User Security Model,  which implies  
           changes to the way SNMP packets are exchanged between agents and    
           managers. Since MIBs are used to define the content of the packets,
           the changes for SNMPv3 do not affect MIB design.  Refer to [16],   
           [17], [18], [19] and [20] for more information on SNMPv3. 
          
          
             7.1 USM Requirements 
                 For PacketCable 1.0, the usmUserTable MUST be configured    
                 immediately  after the AP Reply received from the Provisioning   
                 Server with the following entries.  
          
                 usmUserEngineID         - the SNMP local engine id  
                 usmUserName             - MTA-Prov-xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  
                 usmUserSecurityName     - MTA-Prov-xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 
                 usmUserCloneFrom        - 0.0 
                 usmUserAuthProtocol     - usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol or   
                                           usmHMACSHAAuthProtocol 
                 usmUserAuthKeyChange    - "" 
                 usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange - "" 
                 usmUserPrivProtocol     - usmDESPrivProtocol if privacy  
                                           indicated in AP Reply. 
                                           usmNoPrivProtocol if no privacy is   
                                           indicated in the AP Reply. 
                 UsmUserPrivKeyChange    - "" 
                 UsmUserOwnPrivKeyChange - "" 
                 usmUserPublic           - "" 
                 usmUserStorageType      - permanent 
                 usmUserStatus           - active 
          
          
                 The xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx in the usmUserName and   
                 usmUserSecurityName represents the MAC address of the MTA. 
          
          
                 Initial authentication and privacy keys for this user are  
                 derived from the AP Reply message. Refer to [3] for more   
                 information regarding security in Packetcable and the Key

                  7.2.4 Notify View 
                      The Notify View configuration provides read only access some  
                      MIBs in the MTA. No write access or notifications are defined.

             7.3 MIB View Requirements 
                 The FullAccessView MUST consist of the MIB2 system group, the         
                 ifMib, and all PacketCable defined MIBS. It MAY include vendor        
                 defined MIBs, VACM, USM, and Notifications MIB. The following       
                 lists the required OIDs: 
          
                      1.3.6.1                 /* Full Internet MIB tree  */ 
                      1.3.6.1.2.1.1           /* MIB-II system group MIB tree */ 
                      1.3.6.1.2.1.31          /* MIB-II IF MIB tree           */ 
                                                1.3.6.1.2.1.TBD         /* PacketCable

                 The ReadOnlyView MUST consist of the entire MIB tree contained  
                 in the MTA, including PacketCable defined MIBS and vendor  
                 defined MIBS.    
          
                      1.3.6.1                   /*  Full Internet MIB Tree*/ 
          
          
                 The NotifyView MUST consist of the MTA MIB and Management Event  
                 MIB. It MAY include vendor defined MIBS .

         8. Functional Requirements 
          
            This section describes management functions that are supported by   
            the PacketCable MIB. 
          
             8.1 PacketCable Device Provisioning 
                 The PacketCable 1.0 MIB should provide definitions for  
                 attributes that are required in the MTA device-provisioning  


         Sumanth/Wim                                                   Page 20 




         Internet Draft       Packetcable MTA MIB             June 4, 2002 


                 flows. These attributes are documented in the PacketCable MTA  
                 device provisioning specification [3] and include parameters  
                 such as CMS identifier, MTA domain name, MTA server addresses,  
                 and MTA capabilities. These attributes are defined as         
                 configuration file attributes and/or MIB  
                 objects as needed. 
          
             8.2 Security 
                 The PacketCable MIB provides definitions for attributes that  
                 are required for security handshake of the MTA and the  
                 provisioning server. These attributes include certificates and   
                 signatures. 
          
          
             8.3 Call Signaling/CODEC 
                 The PacketCable MIB should provide attributes that are needed   
                 for management of the call signaling protocol. As of this  
                 writing the only call signaling protocol that is being   
                 specified by PacketCable is NCS; however, work is also underway  
                 for DCS. Example of attributes that have to be supported for  
                 packet voice call signaling include: 
          
                 * Dial timeouts 
                 * Distinctive ring patterns 
                 * Codec capabilities 
                 * Signaling configuration for voice communication end points 
                 * Call agent identifier 
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
              8.4 Management Event mechanism  
                 The PacketCable MIB should provide the means to define and    
                 distribute events generated by the MTA. It should provide the     
                 ability for vendors to define their own events as well as  
                 support PacketCable defined events. These events should support   
                 modifiable attributes such as priority level.  The PacketCable  
                 MIB should allow the ability to log events by a variety of  
                 means. These means should include local log, syslog, SNMP traps  
                 and SNMP informs.  Some means of event thresholding should be  
                 supported. 
          
          
              8.5 Standalone MTA  
                 The Packetcable MIB should provide means to define any specific  
                 management requirements specific for a Standalone MTA. This  
                 would include requirements related to Software Download and  
                 others being handled via the undefined DOCSIS interface in the  
                 case of Embedded MTAs ( Like Network Time ).

         Internet Draft       Packetcable MTA MIB             June 4, 2002 


                 The PacketCable MIB should provide attributes for support of  
                 QoS on the MTA, as well as interoperate with QoS definitions of  
                 DOCSIS. Given that DOCSIS MIBs are including QoS attribute  
                 definitions, the PacketCable MIB will not be required to repeat   
                 these attributes. It might, however, be necessary to define  
                 mechanisms for allocation of specific QoS in the PacketCable  
                 MIB in the specific case of voice communications services.  
                  
                 Examples of these attributes are: 
          
                 * Type of QoS protocol supported, D-QoS 
                 * QoS authority 
                 * QoS assignments 
                 * Provisioned bandwidth
                 * Admitted bandwidth 
                 * Active bandwidth 
                 * Service flow identifiers for each connection 
          
          
              8.7 Primary Line Requirements (For consideration in future  
                                             releases of PacketCable) 
                 The PacketCable MIB should provide attributes that are needed  
                 to satisfy high availability requirements of the voice  
                 communications service as defined in the PacketCable "primary  
                 line" specification. Examples of these attributes are power  
                 loss and network element failure. 
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
              8.8 Packet Voice Transport (For consideration in future releases  
                                          of PacketCable) 
                 The PacketCable MIB should provide attributes that can be used  
                 to monitor and manage packet voice transport. As of this  
                 writing the RTP protocol is used for packet voice transport,  
                 and therefore the RTP MIB [23] can be used for management of  
                 the packet voice transport function of the MTA. Given that the  
                 RTP MIB consists of attributes that relate to fault and  
                 performance data, it is not being considered for the 1.x  
                 release of the PacketCable MIB as of this writing. 
          
          
             8.9 Fault Management (For consideration in future releases of  
                                   PacketCable) 
                 The PacketCable MIB should provide attributes that can be used  
                 in management of network faults and failures. These attributes  
                 and functions related to these attributes are under  
                 consideration in the primary line focus group and will be  
                 included in the MIB in a later release. These attributes  
                 include: 
                 * Standard alerts. 
                 * Common fault messages (software upgrades, resets, link

                   up/down). 
                 * Prioritized alerts (0-7) for throttling and limiting and  
                   class. 
                 * Possible "thin RMON" agent. 
                 * Fault isolation. 
          
             8.10 Performance Management (For consideration in future releases   
                                          of PacketCable) 
                 The PacketCable MIB should provide attributes that can be used          
                 in monitoring of the performance of the network when used for  
                 voice communications. As of this writing no focus group is  
                 considering performance monitoring aspects of the PacketCable  
                 network. Examples of attributes that should be considered for  
                 performance monitoring are: 
                 * Packet counts 
                 * Call signaling status 
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
         9 MIBS available in a Packetcable Network. 
           In designing the PacketCable MIB, it was necessary to consider other  
           MIBs that are also present in the network and which can provide the    
           required attributes and functions. This section describes the MIBs  
           that can be present in the PacketCable MTA device, and which can be  
           used for PacketCable management functions as needed.  
          
          
           The following table lists MIBs that are present in the PacketCable  
           device. Note that the device can be a cable modem or an E-MTA or an  
           S-MTA.

                The data-handling part of the PacketCable network is dependent         
                on DOCSIS 1.1 MIBs as defined in [6], [7] and [8]. 
          
             9.2 IF MIB 
                This is the interfaces section of MIB II [24], and is needed for  
                definitions of multiple interfaces in the MTA.  
          
          
          
          
          
          
             9.3 MIB II 
                 The second version of the Management Information Base (MIB-II)        
                 is defined in [25], [26] and [27] for use with network  
                 management protocols in TCP/IP-based internet. Not all objects  
                 in this MIB are deemed necessary for the PacketCable MTA  
                 device. PacketCable 1.x requires only the system, interfaces,  
                 IP, and transmission objects of MIB II to be present in the  
                 MTA.  
          
          
                 By using sysObjectID the manager will be able to determine any  
                 enterprise specific MIBs which must be used to manage the MTAs 
          
                   sysObjectID is defined as follows:

                   unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is  
                   being managed.  For example, if vendor    
                   `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree          
                   1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier

                  9.3.1 "iftable" Requirements 
                      Each instance of the end-point in an E-MTA MUST have a  
                      corresponding entry ("conceptual row") in the  "ifTable"               
                      MIB Table. 
                      For each "conceptual row" in the "ifTable" table, the               
                      following conceptual columns MUST be used: 
          
                      - "ifIndex" 
                      - "ifDescr"

                      - "ifAdminStatus" 
                      - "ifOperStatus" 
          
          
                      Each conceptual row in "ifTable" MUST conform to the "IANA               
                      ifType-MIB" definition for the PacketCable interface type: 
          
                      - "ifType"      - voiceOverCable (198)

                      Each interface of the E-MTA MUST be numbered sequentially  
                      according to the DOCSIS 1.1 "Operations Support System  
                      Interface Specification[15]"

             9.6 PacketCable MTA Signaling MIB  
                 The MTA SIGNALING MIB contains Call Signaling information for  
                 provisioning. The MTA SIGNALING MIB is derived as part of the  
                 PacketCable enterprise branch of MIB tree. Application for  
                 standard acceptance is being discussed. No other functionality  
                 other than MTA SIGNALING provisioning is defined at this time,

                 although future releases of the MTA SIGNALING MIB may enhance  
                 the capabilities. 
          
          
                  9.6.1 MTA Signaling MIB general configuration information 
                      The MTA SIGNALING MIB contains general configuration  
                      information that applies to network call signaling on a  
                      device basis. This data only provides the means to  
                      provision call signaling on a device basis. 
          
          
                  9.6.2  MTA NCS MIB per endpoint data 
                      The MTA NCS MIB contains a per endpoint table. This table  
                      contains general configuration information that applies to  
                      network call signaling on a per endpoint basis. This  
                      information is also found in the configuration file  
                      defined in the PacketCable NCS specification [4]. This  
                      data only provides the means to provision network call  
                      signaling per endpoint.  
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
             9.7 PacketCable MTA Device MIB 
                 The MTA Device MIB contains data for provisioning the MTA  
                 device and supporting the provisioned functions. The data is  
                 derived from the PacketCable device provisioning specification           
                 [2], and the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB[6]. No other  
                 functionality other than device provisioning and support of  
                 provisioned data is defined at this time, although future  
                 releases of the MTA Device MIB may enhance the capabilities. 
          
                  9.7.1  MTA Device MIB general configuration information 
                      The MTA Device MIB contains general configuration  
                      information to provision the MTA on a device basis. These               
                      objects support provisioning required servers, security  
                      information, and non-type specific call signaling data. 
          
          
                  9.7.2 MTA Device MIB Syslog Information 
                      The MTA Device MIB contains syslog control information  
                      similar to DOCSIS. This is to maintain the syslog  
                      capability of the voice communication MTA separate from  
                      the DOCSIS CM syslog. As in DOCSIS, it supports a syslog

              9.8 Management Event MIB 
                  The Management Event MIB provides a common data and format  
                  definition for events (informative, alarm, etc). It also  
                  specifies by what means events are transmitted. Use of a           
                  common event mechanism facilitates management of the MTA in a  
                  multi-vendor environment and provides a standard means to  
                  implement PacketCable specified events. 
          
                  As mentioned before partitioning of voice and data services  
                  and support of both S-MTA and E-MTA has been requirements for  
                  design of the MIB. Figures 4 and 5 depict possible  
                  organizations of the MIB within an MTA in order to meet these  
                  requirements. The common MIB category is basically a  
                  collection of MIBs, which can be present on both the cable  
                  modem as well as the MTA device.

             10. Functional components of an MTA. 
                 This section identifies the functional areas within an MTA  
                 device as per the requirements imposed by Packetcable. As shown  
                 in Figure 3, the functional components of the MTA can be  
                 organized into two distinct areas, i.e. packet based protocols,  
                 which run on top of IP and the voice subsystem, which consists  
                 of DSP engines and their associated software.  
          
                 MIBs that are implemented in the MTA have to be organized so as  
                 to facilitate this separation. PacketCable 1.0 MIB specifies  
                 functions for the packet based protocol section of the MTA. As  
                 of this writing there are no analog voice MIBs specified for  
                 the MTA.
