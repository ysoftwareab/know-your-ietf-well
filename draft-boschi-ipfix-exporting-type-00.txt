Internet-Draft           IPFIX Type Information              August 2007


1.  Introduction

   The IPFIX protocol specification allows the creation of enterprise-
   specific Information Elements to easily extend the protocol to meet
   requirements which aren't covered by the existing Information Model.
   However, IPFIX Templates provide only the ability to export the size
   of the fields defined by these Information Elements; there is no
   mechanism to provide full type information for these Information
   Elements as is defined for the Information Elements in the IPFIX
   Information Model.

   This limits the interoperability of enterprise-specific Information
   Elements.  It is not possible to use analysis tools on IPFIX records
   containing these partially defined Information Elements that have not
   been developed with a priori knowledge of their types, since such
   tools will not be able to decode them; these tools can only treat and
   store them as opaque octet arrays.  However, if richer information is
   available, additional operations such as efficient storage, display,
   and limited analysis of records containing enterprise-specific
   Information Elements become possible, even for Collecting Processes
   that had not been specifically developed to understand them.

   This document proposes a mechanism to encode the full set of
   properties available for the definition of Information Elements
   within the IPFIX Information Model inline within an IPFIX Message
   stream using IPFIX Options.  This mechanism may be used to fully
   define type information for Information Elements used within a
   message stream, without resort to an external reference or reliance
   on out-of-band configuration.


2.  Terminology

   Terms used in this document that are defined in the Terminology
   section of the IPFIX Protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] document are
   to be interpreted as defined there.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Type Information Export

   This section describes the mechanism used to encode Information
   Element type information within an IPFIX Message stream.  This
   mechanism consists of an Options Template Record used to define
   Information Element type records, and a set of Information Elements

   required by these type records.  We first specify the necessary
   Information Elements, followed by the Information Element Type
   Options Template itself.  Note that Information Element type records
   require one Information Element, informationElementId, that is
   defined in the PSAMP Information Model [I-D.ietf-psamp-info].

3.1.  informationElementDataType

   Description:   A description of the storage type of an IPFIX
      information element.  These correspond to the abstract data types
      defined in section 3.1 of the IPFIX Information Model
      [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info]; see that section for more information on
      the types described below.  This field may take the following
      values:

3.8.  privateEnterpriseNumber

   Description:   A private enterprise number used to scope an
      informationElementID, as would appear in an IPFIX Template Record.
      This element can be used to scope properties to a specific
      Information Element.  If the Enterprise ID bit of the
      corresponding Information Element is cleared (has the value 0),
      this IE should be set to 0.  The presence of a non-zero value in
      this IE implies that the Enterprise ID bit of the corresponding
      Information Element is set (has the value 1).

3.9.  Information Element Type Options Template

   The Information Element Type Options Template attaches type
   information to Information Elements used within Template Records, as
   scoped to an Observation Domain within a Transport Session.  This
   provides a mechanism for representing an IPFIX Information Model
   inline within an IPFIX Message stream.  Data Records described by
   this template are referred to as Information Element type records.

   In deployments in which interoperability across vendor
   implementations of IPFIX is important, an Exporting Process exporting
   data using Templates containing enterprise-specific Information
   Elements SHOULD export an Information Element type record for each
   enterprise-specific Information Element it exports.  Collecting
   Processes MAY use these type records to improve handling of unknown
   enterprise-specific Information Elements.  Exporting Processes using
   enterprise-specific Information Elements to implement proprietary
   features MAY omit type records for those Information Elements.

   Information Element type records MUST be handled by Collecting
   Processes as scoped to the Transport Session in which they are sent;
   this facility is not intended to provide a method for the permanent
   definition of Information Elements.

   Similarly, for security reasons, type information for a given
   Information Element MUST NOT be re-defined by Information Element
   type records.  Once an Information Element type record has been

   exported for a given Information Element within a given Transport
   Session, all subsequent type records for that Information Element
   MUST be identical.  If conflicting semantic or type information is
   received in multiple semantics records by a Collecting Process, the
   Collecting Process MUST reset the Transport Session.

   The template SHOULD contain the following Information Elements as
   defined in the PSAMP Information Model [I-D.ietf-psamp-info] and in
   this document, above:

4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] apply.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies the creation of several new IPFIX Information
   Elements in the IPFIX Information Element registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix, as defined in section 3 above.
   IANA has assigned the following Information Element numbers for their
   respective Information Elements as specified below:

   o  Information Element Number TBD1 for the informationElementDataType
      Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD2 for the
      informationElementDescription Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD3 for the informationElementName
      Information Element

Appendix A.  Examples

   The following example illustrates how the type information extension
   mechanism defined in this document may be used to describe the
   semantics of enterprise-specific Information Elements.  The
   Information Elements used in this example are as follows:

   o  initialTCPFlags, CERT (PEN 6871) private IE 14, 1 octet, the TCP
      flags on the first TCP packet in the flow.

   o  unionTCPFlags, CERT (PEN 6871) private IE 15, 1 octet, the union
      of the TCP flags on all packets after the first TCP packet in the
      flow.

              Figure 1: Template with Enterprise-Specific IEs

   However, a Collecting Process receiving Data Sets described by this
   Template can only treat the enterprise-specific Information Elements
   as opaque octets; specifically, there is no hint to the collector
   that they contain flag information.  To use the type information
   extension mechanism to address this problem, the Exporting Process
   would first export the Information Element Type Options Template
   described in section 3.9 above:
