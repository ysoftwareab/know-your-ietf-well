 Abstract  
     

    This document proposes a "two-plane three-tier" QoS framework for 
    mobile IPv6 networks. In this framework the Access Networks are 
    connected with wired backbone through default routers. QoS policies 
    which are implemented in inter-Administration Domains (between Qos 
    Agents) and intra-Administration (between QoS Agent and Local QoS

    Agents) and QoS negotiations are in the control plane. User data is 
    transported in the transport plane. COPS/Diameter is used for 
    exchanging QoS policies.  

    Three-Tier QoS mechanisms mean that QoS mechanisms should be done 
    in three levels. The first level is Inter-Administration Domain QoS 
    mechanisms across neighboring Administration Domains, and the 
    second level is Intra-Administration Domain QoS mechanisms inside 
    each Administration Domain while the third level is edge QoS 
    negotiation and end-to-end QoS negotiation. The aggregate traffic 
    crossing Administration Domain borders is served according to 
    relatively stable, long-lived bilateral agreements. End-to-end QoS 
    support is achieved through the concatenation of such bilateral 
    agreements.   

    QoS signalings are independent of the proposed framework. As an 
    example, the extended Mobile IPv6 signalings that include Binding 
    Update, Binding Request, and Binding Acknowledge are used for end-
    to-end QoS negotiations and resource advance reservation.

 1. Introduction 
         

    Over the past several years there has been a considerable amount of 
    research within the field of QoS for wired IP networks. Much less 
    progress has been made in addressing the issue of overall end-to-
    end QoS framework for wireless mobile IPv6 networks. 

    The current wisdom is that the existing circuit switched and 2G 
    (second generation) wireless systems will eventually evolve/morph 
    into an end-to-end IP platform that provides ubiquitous real-time 
    as well as non-real-time services based on 3G (third generation) 
    wireless IPv6 mobile networks. A QoS framework that provides the 
    end-to-end QoS guarantees for the future network is worth studying. 
    The intention of QoS framework research is to provide a framework 
    for the integration of QoS control and management mechanisms. There 
    are three building blocks which are QoS principles for governing 
    the construction of a generalized QoS framework, QoS Specification 
    for capturing application level QoS requirements and QoS Mechanisms 
    for realizing desired end-to-end QoS behavior in a generalized QoS 
    framework [ACH98].  

    Five QoS principles which are transparency principle, integration 
    principle, separation principle, performance principle and multiple 
    time scales principle motivated the design of a generalized QoS 
    framework are given in [ACH98]. QoS specification encompasses flow 
    performance specification, level of service, cost of service, QoS 
    management policy and flow synchronisation specification. QoS 
    mechanisms encompasses QoS provision mechanisms, QoS control 
    mechanisms and QoS management mechanisms. QoS provision mechanisms 
    deals with flow establishment and end-to-end QoS re-negotiation 
    phases.  

    To date, most of the developments in the area of QoS support have 
    occurred in the context of individual architectural components 
    [HCCB94]. Much less progress has been made in addressing the issue 
    of an overall QoS framework for mobility networks. There has been, 
    however, considerable progress in the separate areas of 
    distributed-systems platforms [HCCB94, APM91], operating systems 
    [BL91, LM93], transport systems [DBLL92, WM93] and multimedia 
    networking [TOP90, CSZ92] support for QoS. In end-systems, most of 
    the progress has been made in the areas of scheduling [LL73, 
    STA95], flow synchronization [GHA90, EDP92]. In networks, research 
    has focused on providing suitable traffic models [KUR93] and 
    service disciplines [ZK91], as well as appropriate admission 
    control and resource reservation protocols [RFC2205]. The above 
    literatures are focused on wired networks or applications. The 
    current state of QoS support in architectural frameworks can be

    summarized as follows [HCCB94]: incompleteness, lack of mechanisms 
    to support QoS guarantees, and lack of an overall framework. For 
    QoS framework for wireless mobile IPv6 networks the current state 
    is same as the above. 

    The QoS framework proposed in this draft is based on 
    Differenticated Services, IPv6 and Mobile IPv6. Two key 
    characteristics of the framework are: (1) there is a central server 
    which has global information of the whole administration domain, 
    and several local ingress nodes which feed the local information to 
    the central server; and (2) the QoS signaling and transport are 
    separated in that the central server deals with the QoS mechanisms 
    and default router handle actual transport traffic. Based on these 
    two characteristics, many QoS requirements in mobile IPv6 
    environment can be achieved efficiently. It also provides 
    flexibility for different QoS session management that can be either 
    based on reservation or provisioning. The framework is also easy to 
    integrate with Mobile IPv6. The framework is depicted in this 
    draft, but the detailed protocols about QoS signaligns and QoS 
    policies will be presented in other drafts. 

    Section 3 describes the two-plane framework and its components. 
    Section 4 explains three-tier QoS mechanisms. How the framework 
    guarantees the end-to-end QoS and the three-tier QoS mechanisms are 
    presented in Section 5.

 2. Terminology 
         

    MN (mobile node)  
                        MN is the device that allows users to 
                        communicate, and also provides means of 
                        interaction between users and the networks. 
                        Traffic is generated/received by MN and may be 
                        queued in the MN while waiting for 
                        transmission/reception. 

    AN (Access Network) 
                        The AN represents the wireless and back-haul 
                        infrastructure that provides MNs with wireless 
                        access to the wired infrastructure. An AN 
                        usually comprises a set of base stations and 
                        base station controllers.

    AD (Administration Domain) 
                        An AD has the same management methods, pricing 
                        policies and so on. An AD belongs to an 
                        administrative organization and an 
                        administrative organization may have one or 
                        more ADs. An AD includes a backbone and some 
                        ANs that directly connect to the backbone. 

    QA (QoS Agent) 
                        There is one logical QA in each AD. The QA has 
                        the global information about the resources 
                        available in the whole domain. The 
                        communications between the QAs is through the 
                        COPS [RFC2748] protocol or Diameter protocol. 
                        The QA is responsible for QoS management 
                        mechanisms between the neighboring ADs and 
                        responsible for QoS control mechanisms between 
                        the LQAs. 

    LQA (Local QoS Agent) 
                         LQA is a separate logical entity and maybe 
                         incorporated with the default router of the 
                         Differentiated Service domain. LQA has the 
                         local information about the AN. The MN 
                         interacts with LQA, if necessary, when the MN 
                         requests certain degrees of QoS in this 
                         domain. The LQA is the entity for QoS 
                         negotiation and signaling between MN and the 
                         network control system, i.e. it is for QoS 
                         control. The LQA decides what services are 
                         available for each MN. Thus, the LQA is an 
                         intelligent entity residing in the control 
                         plane for QoS negotiation and signaling. LQAs 
                         provide the local information to QA 
                         periodically. LQA maintains a table that is 
                         then updated by QA periodically too. Based on 
                         this table, LQA will mark, police, shape, map, 
                         etc. the traffic going through the default 
                         router. Comparing to QA, it is less 
                         intelligent. 
                          
                         The communications between the QA and LQAs 
                         through the COPS protocol or Diameter protocol 
                         and the communications between the LQA and the 
                         default router through the COPS protocol or 
                         Diameter protocol too. LQA is responsible for 
                         QoS provision mechanisms.

                         directly to the backbone network and the 
                         traffic from AN to backbone. 

 3. Two-plane framework  
     

    The separation principle for the design of a generalized QoS 
    framework states that media transfer, control and management are 
    functionally distinct architectural activities [A92]. The principle 
    states that these tasks should be separated in architectural 
    frameworks; one aspect of separation is the distinction between 
    signalling and media-transfer; flows (which are isochronous in 
    nature) generally require a wide variety of high bandwidth, low 
    latency, non-assured services with some form of jitter correction; 
    on the other hand, signalling (which is full duplex and 
    asynchronous in nature) generally requires low bandwidth, assured-
    type services with no jitter constraint. 

    In the proposed framework the QoS mechanisms and QoS negotiations 
    are in the control plane and media-transfer is in the transport 
    plane. Three-tier QoS mechanisms mean that QoS mechanisms should be 
    done in three levels. The first level is Inter-AD QoS mechanisms 
    across neighboring ADs, and the second level is Intra-AD QoS 
    mechanisms inside each AD, while the third level is QoS negotiation 
    which includes Edge QoS negotiation and End-to-end QoS negotiation. 

 3.1 Control Plane 
     

    QAs and LQAs are responsible for control tasks in an AD. Three-tier 
    control plane includes Inter-AD QoS mechanisms, Intra-AD QoS 
    mechanisms and QoS negotiation which includes Edge QoS negotiation 
    and end-to-end negotiation. QoS negotiation is accomplished by end-
    to-end QoS signaling which extended the existing Mobile IPv6 
    mobility management signaling as an example. 

    In the proposed framework, there is at least one QA and several LQA 
    in an AD. LQAs reside generally in the edge of wired backbone 
    networks that connect to wireless network through default router. 
    The QA retains the global information of the domain, and informs 
    LQAs what to do when traffic comes in. The MN has the QoS signaling 
    with LQA, and LQA has the QoS signaling with GQA. The actual 
    traffic generated by MN goes through the default router. The QA and 
    LQA are in control plane while the default routers are in transport 
    plane. By retaining the global information in QA and separating 
    control plane and transport plane, the framework is flexible, easy 
    to add new services, and more efficient for mobile environment. The 
    existing signalings of Mobile IPv6 are extended for QoS signaling.

 3.2 Transport Plane 
     

    User traffic is transported in transport plane. The user data enter 
    the backbone network from AN through default router. How about the 
    backbone network in the transport plane? 

    As we know, for controlling the traffic there are two types of 
    Internet QoS: Integrated Services [IntServ] and Differentiated 
    Services. Integrated Services is based on resource reservation and 
    network resources are apportioned according to an application's QoS 
    requests, and subject to bandwidth management policy. Integrated 
    Services can guarantee QoS for per-flow traffic. Differentiated 
    Services is based on prioritization and network traffic is 
    classified and apportioned network resources according to bandwidth 
    management policy criteria. To enable QoS, classifications give 
    preferential treatment to applications identified as having more 
    demanding requirements. Differentiated Services can guarantee QoS 
    for per-aggregate traffic. 

    While the aggregated behavior state of the Differentiated Services 
    architecture does offer excellent scaling properties, the lack of 
    end-to-end signaling facilities makes such an approach one that 
    cannot operate in isolation within any environment. What appears to 
    be required within the Differentiated Services model is both 
    resource availability signaling from the core of the network to the 
    Differentiated Service boundary and some form of signaling from the 
    boundary to the client application [RFC2990]. 

    In the proposed framework we made use of the ideas of RSVP/IntServ 
    to extend the signalings of Mobile IPv6 as QoS allocation protocol 
    for the per-flow traffic in the AN. When the traffic leaves the AN, 
    per-flow traffic is aggregated to form aggregate-flows in the 
    default router. Moreover Differentiated Service is selected in the 
    backbone network and the QoS for aggregate flows between ADs is 
    guaranteed by the other mechanisms [RFC2996], [FCFB99] and 
    [RFC2998]. Other QoS protocols such as MPLS [MPLS] can be selected 
    in the backbone network too.  

    Figure 2 is a picture about transport plane for end-to-end QoS 
    guarantee. 

    There are two mapping mechanisms in transport plane: Intra-AD 
    mapping and Inter-AD mapping. Because of different QoS mechanisms 
    in ANs and the backbone network, Intra-AD mapping mechanisms can 
    guarantee the traffic between ANs and backbone network with QoS 
    consistency. Inter-AD mapping mechanisms can guarantee the traffic 
    between ADs with QoS consistency.

 4. Three-tier QoS mechanisms in control plane 
         

    In [TWOZ99] a two-tier resource management model for the Internet 
    is proposed. The solution resembles the current two-tier routing 
    hierarchy and allows individual administrative domains to 
    independently make their own decisions on strategies and protocols 
    to use for internal resource management. We borrowed some ideas 
    from this paper and the three-tier QoS mechanisms are proposed in 
    the QoS framework. 

    The tenet of our design is what we call three-tier QoS mechanisms. 
    By this term we mean that QoS mechanisms should be done in three 
    levels. The first level is Inter-AD QoS mechanisms across 
    neighboring ADs, and the second level is Intra-AD QoS mechanisms 
    inside each AD, while the third level is QoS negotiation which 
    includes Edge QoS negotiation and End-to-end QoS negotiation. 
    Following the paradigm of Internet Routing, each AD is free to 
    choose whatever QoS mechanism it deems proper for internal QoS 
    mechanisms as long as its bilateral resource agreements with 
    neighboring ADs are met.  

    These three QoS mechanisms have different time cycle for action. 
    The first tier has the longer time cycle than the other tiers. The 
    third tier is based on per-flow time cycle. 

 4.1 The first tier QoS mechanism 
         

    While AN QoS mechanisms can be fined grained (per flow), we require 
    that Inter-NAD QoS agreements such as SLAs are made for the 
    aggregate traffic crossing ADs. Furthermore, Inter-AD agreements 
    should change infrequently at a larger time-cycle than that of 
    individual applications. These two requirements on Inter-AD 
    agreements provide substantial scaling characteristics by 
    decoupling Inter-AD QoS mechanisms from individual end-to-end flows. 

    Note that the QA contacts only its immediate neighbor for all its 
    traffic, although the traffic may head toward various final 
    destinations far away. It is the responsibility of the downstream 
    domain, after agreeing to carry the client traffic, to both 
    guarantee QoS internally as well as request QoS from the downstream 
    neighbors for the portions of the traffic that exit the domain. 

    As we know, end-to-end QoS is provided by the concatenation of 
    Intra-AD QoS mechanisms and bilateral SLAs between neighboring ADs. 
    These agreements specify the amount of traffic belonging to 
    different classes that crosses links connecting adjacent ADs. To 
    ensure that the level of actual traffic is always lower than the 
    negotiated limit, the receiving domain polices incoming traffic,

    dropping or demoting excess traffic. Knowing that offending traffic 
    will be policed, the sending domain in turn, shapes traffic so that 
    it always remains in profile. 

 4.2 The second tier QoS mechanism 
     

    LQAs contact QA to request certain about of resources to cover for 
    the aggregate high quality traffic leaving the AN. Once the 
    agreement is in place, individual applications can request and use 
    portions of the aggregate allocated amount. When and if the 
    allocated resources are exhausted, the LQAs may be able to re-
    negotiate the agreement with its QA, allocating a larger amount of 
    resources.  

    For example one of the purposes of Intra-AD QoS provisioning 
    mechanisms is to check whether sufficient network resources are 
    available for traffic flowing through each AN and if so to allocate 
    domain resources for this traffic. Each LQA is responsible for QoS 
    provisioning internally. 

 4.3 The third tier QoS mechanism 
     

    LQA and default router are responsible for Edge QoS negotiation 
    between MN/CN and the default router when a traffic flow comes. LQA 
    will tell default router how to configure itself if the negotiation 
    is successful. End-to-end QoS negotiation occurs between MN and CN. 

 5. QoS negotiation and QoS signaling 
     

    Meeting QoS guarantees in mobility network systems is fundamentally 
    an end-to-end issue, that is, from application to application. In 
    our framework there is a QA acts as the QoS controller for each 
    administrative domain. Neighboring QAs communicate with each other 
    to establish Inter-domain QoS agreements such as SLAs. The 
    aggregate traffic crossing domain borders is served according to 
    relatively stable, long lived bilateral agreements. End-to-End QoS 
    support is achieved through the concatenation of such bilateral 
    agreements. 

    QoS negotiation includes Edge QoS negotiation and end-to-end QoS 
    negotiation. Edge QoS negotiation means the negotiation between 
    MN/CN and default routers. End-to-end QoS negotiation between MN 
    and CN is accomplished by QoS signalings that will be explained in 
    next section as an example. 

 5.1 QoS negotiation 
     
   
 Kan, Ma                  Expires October 2002                       11 
 draft-Kan-QoS-Framework-00.txt                             April, 2002 
  
  
    When a MN moves to a foreign network and wants to communicate with 
    other nodes, it will negotiate with the foreign network through the 
    QoS signalings to guarantee the QoS for its applications. If the 
    foreign network cannot meet MN's QoS requirements, MN can decide 
    whether or not enter this network or re-negotiate with the network 
    with degrading its QoS requirements. Moreover, the foreign network 
    can decide whether or not allow the MN to enter based on the 
    current conditions. The foreign network must inform MN the QoS 
    negotiation results and this is the response of QoS. 

    If the foreign network allows the MN to enter, it will inform MN 
    the successful results through the QoS signalings and reserve 
    required resources for MN based on some QoS management policies. 
    When MN leaves the network, the resources used by MN will be 
    released. 

    After MN is admitted to enter the foreign network, it will inform 
    CN of its QoS requirements for an application through QoS 
    signalings. The CN will decide whether or not communicate with this 
    MN, and CN will inform MN the unsuccessful negotiation result if CN 
    cannot meet MN's QoS requirements. Otherwise the CN will negotiate 
    with the network in which CN is locating based on the MN's QoS 
    requirements. In some cases CN can meet MN's requirements but 
    network cannot. If the CN and the CN's located network all can meet 
    MN's QoS requirements, MN may communicate with CN. 

    The procedures of QoS negotiation has three phases: 1) the 
    negotiation between MN and its located network, 2) the negotiation 
    between MN and CN, 3) the negotiation between CN and its located 
    network. Phase 1 and phase 3 are called Edge QoS negotiation, and 
    Phase 2 is called end-to-end QoS negotiation. 

    The procedures of QoS negotiation are dependent on what QoS 
    Signalings are used. 

 5.2 QoS Signalings 
     

    A suite of QoS signalings is necessary for QoS negotiation in order 
    to guarantee per-flow end-to-end QoS. Although RSVP is a popular 
    QoS signaling, we build a new suite of QoS signaling by extending 
    the existing Moible IPv6 signalings other than selecting RSVP based 
    on the following factors: 

    1) the limitations of RSVP; 

    2) the existing Moible IPv6 mobility management signalings can be 
    extended for QoS negotiation, and doing so can integrate mobility 
    management within QoS negotiation.

    The extended Mobile IPv6 signalings for QoS negotiation is divided 
    into two parts: edge QoS signalings and end-to-end QoS signalings. 
    Figure 2 shows the QoS signalings.  

    The stateless-based Differentiated Services [DiffServ] lack of QoS 
    response and there is no explicit negotiation between the 
    application's signaling of the service request and the network's 
    capability to deliver a particular service response. If the network 
    is incapable of meeting the service request, then the request 
    simply will not be honored. In such a situation there is no 
    requirement for the network to inform the application that the 
    request cannot be honored, and it is left to the application to 
    determine if the service has not been delivered. So our QoS 
    signaling can be a complement for DS. 

    The detailed design of the QoS signaling and the procedures of QoS 
    negotiation will be appeared in other draft.
