                      Elliptic Curves for Security
                       draft-irtf-cfrg-curves-09

Abstract

   This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that offer
   high practical security in cryptographic applications, including
   Transport Layer Security (TLS).  These curves are intended to operate
   at the ~128-bit and ~224-bit security level, respectively, and are
   generated deterministically based on a list of required properties.

1.  Introduction

   Since the initial standardization of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC
   [RFC6090]) in [SEC1] there has been significant progress related to
   both efficiency and security of curves and implementations.  Notable
   examples are algorithms protected against certain side-channel
   attacks, various 'special' prime shapes that allow faster modular
   arithmetic, and a larger set of curve models from which to choose.
   There is also concern in the community regarding the generation and
   potential weaknesses of the curves defined by NIST [NIST].

   This memo specifies two elliptic curves ("curve25519" and "curve448")
   that lend themselves to constant-time implementation and an
   exception-free scalar multiplication that is resistant to a wide
   range of side-channel attacks, including timing and cache attacks.
   They are Montgomery curves (where y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x) and thus have
   birationally equivalent Edwards versions.  Edwards curves support the
   fastest (currently known) complete formulas for the elliptic-curve
   group operations, specifically the Edwards curve x^2 + y^2 = 1 +

   dx^2y^2 for primes p when p = 3 mod 4, and the twisted Edwards curve
   -x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2 when p = 1 mod 4.  The maps to/from the
   Montgomery curves to their (twisted) Edwards equivalents are also
   given.

   This memo also specifies how these curves can be used with the
   Diffie-Hellman protocol for key agreement.

4.  Recommended Curves

4.1.  Curve25519

   For the ~128-bit security level, the prime 2^255-19 is recommended
   for performance on a wide-range of architectures.  Few primes of the
   form 2^c-s with s small exist between 2^250 and 2^521, and other
   choices of coefficient are not as competitive in performance.  This

   prime is congruent to 1 mod 4 and the derivation procedure in
   Appendix A results in the following Montgomery curve v^2 = u^3 +
   A*u^2 + u, called "curve25519":

   The base point is u = 9, v = 1478161944758954479102059356840998688726
   4606134616475288964881837755586237401.

   This curve is birationally equivalent to a twisted Edwards curve -x^2

   The birational maps are:

     (u, v) = ((1+y)/(1-y), sqrt(-486664)*u/x)
     (x, y) = (sqrt(-486664)*u/v, (u-1)/(u+1))

   The Montgomery curve defined here is equal to the one defined in
   [curve25519] and the equivalent twisted Edwards curve is equal to the
   one defined in [ed25519].

4.2.  Curve448

   For the ~224-bit security level, the prime 2^448-2^224-1 is
   recommended for performance on a wide-range of architectures.  This
   prime is congruent to 3 mod 4 and the derivation procedure in

   The 4-isogeny maps between the Montgomery curve and this Edwards
   curve are:

     (u, v) = (y^2/x^2, (2 - x^2 - y^2)*y/x^3)
     (x, y) = (4*v*(u^2 - 1)/(u^4 - 2*u^2 + 4*v^2 + 1),
               -(u^5 - 2*u^3 - 4*u*v^2 + u)/
               (u^5 - 2*u^2*v^2 - 2*u^3 - 2*v^2 + u))

   The curve edwards448 defined here is also called "Goldilocks" and is
   equal to the one defined in [goldilocks].

5.  The X25519 and X448 functions

   The "X25519" and "X448" functions perform scalar multiplication on
   the Montgomery form of the above curves.  (This is used when
   implementing Diffie-Hellman.)  The functions take a scalar and a
   u-coordinate as inputs and produce a u-coordinate as output.
   Although the functions work internally with integers, the inputs and
   outputs are 32-byte strings (for X25519) or 56-byte strings (for
   X448) and this specification defines their encoding.

   The u-coordinates are elements of the underlying field GF(2^255-19)
   or GF(2^448-2^224-1) and are encoded as an array of bytes, u, in
   little-endian order such that u[0] + 256*u[1] + 256^2*u[2] + ... +
   256^(n-1)*u[n-1] is congruent to the value modulo p and u[n-1] is
   minimal.  When receiving such an array, implementations of X25519
   (but not X448) MUST mask the most-significant bit in the final byte.
   This is done to preserve compatibility with point formats which
   reserve the sign bit for use in other protocols and to increase
   resistance to implementation fingerprinting.

   Implementations MUST accept non-canonical values and process them as
   if they had been reduced modulo the field prime.  The non-canonical

   values are 2^255-19 through 2^255-1 for X25519 and 2^448-2^224-1
   through 2^448-1 for X448.

   The following functions implement this in Python, although the Python
   code is not intended to be performant nor side-channel free.  Here
   the "bits" parameter should be set to 255 for X25519 and 448 for
   X448:

   def decodeLittleEndian(b, bits):
       return sum([b[i] << 8*i for i in range((bits+7)/8)])

   def decodeUCoordinate(u, bits):
       u_list = [ord(b) for b in u]
       # Ignore any unused bits.
       if bits % 8:
           u_list[-1] &= (1<<(bits%8))-1
       return decodeLittleEndian(u_list, bits)

   def encodeUCoordinate(u, bits):
       u = u % p
       return ''.join([chr((u >> 8*i) & 0xff)
                       for i in range((bits+7)/8)])

   Scalars are assumed to be randomly generated bytes.  For X25519, in
   order to decode 32 random bytes as an integer scalar, set the three
   least significant bits of the first byte and the most significant bit
   of the last to zero, set the second most significant bit of the last
   byte to 1 and, finally, decode as little-endian.  This means that
   resulting integer is of the form 2^254 + 8 * {0, 1, ..., 2^(251) -
   1}. Likewise, for X448, set the two least significant bits of the
   first byte to 0, and the most significant bit of the last byte to 1.
   This means that the resulting integer is of the form 2^447 + 4 * {0,
   1, ..., 2^(445) - 1}.

   def decodeScalar25519(k):
       k_list = [ord(b) for b in k]
       k_list[0] &= 248
       k_list[31] &= 127
       k_list[31] |= 64
       return decodeLittleEndian(k_list, 255)

   def decodeScalar448(k):
       k_list = [ord(b) for b in k]
       k_list[0] &= 252
       k_list[55] |= 128
       return decodeLittleEndian(k_list, 448)

   To implement the X25519(k, u) and X448(k, u) functions (where k is
   the scalar and u is the u-coordinate) first decode k and u and then
   perform the following procedure, which is taken from [curve25519] and
   based on formulas from [montgomery].  All calculations are performed
   in GF(p), i.e., they are performed modulo p.  The constant a24 is
   (486662 - 2) / 4 = 121665 for curve25519/X25519 and (156326 - 2) / 4
   = 39081 for curve448/X448.

   x_1 = u
   x_2 = 1
   z_2 = 0
   x_3 = u
   z_3 = 1
   swap = 0

   For t = bits-1 down to 0:
       k_t = (k >> t) & 1
       swap ^= k_t
       // Conditional swap; see text below.
       (x_2, x_3) = cswap(swap, x_2, x_3)
       (z_2, z_3) = cswap(swap, z_2, z_3)
       swap = k_t

       A = x_2 + z_2
       AA = A^2
       B = x_2 - z_2
       BB = B^2
       E = AA - BB
       C = x_3 + z_3
       D = x_3 - z_3
       DA = D * A
       CB = C * B
       x_3 = (DA + CB)^2
       z_3 = x_1 * (DA - CB)^2
       x_2 = AA * BB
       z_2 = E * (AA + a24 * E)

   // Conditional swap; see text below.
   (x_2, x_3) = cswap(swap, x_2, x_3)
   (z_2, z_3) = cswap(swap, z_2, z_3)
   Return x_2 * (z_2^(p - 2))

   (Note that these formulas are slightly different from Montgomery's
   original paper.  Implementations are free to use any correct
   formulas.)

   Finally, encode the resulting value as 32 or 56 bytes in little-
   endian order.  For X25519, the unused, most-significant bit MUST be
   zero.

   The cswap function SHOULD be implemented in constant time (i.e.
   independent of the swap argument).  For example, this can be done as
   follows:

   cswap(swap, x_2, x_3):
         dummy = mask(swap) AND (x_2 XOR x_3)
         x_2 = x_2 XOR dummy
         x_3 = x_3 XOR dummy
         Return (x_2, x_3)

   Where mask(swap) is the all-1 or all-0 word of the same length as x_2
   and x_3, computed, e.g., as mask(swap) = 0 - swap.

5.1.  Side-channel considerations

   X25519 and X448 are designed so that fast, constant-time
   implementations are easier to produce.  The procedure above ensures
   that the same sequence of field operations is performed for all
   values of the secret key, thus eliminating a common source of side-
   channel leakage.  However, this alone does not prevent all side-
   channels by itself.  It is important that the pattern of memory
   accesses and jumps not depend on the values of any of the bits of k.
   It is also important that the arithmetic used not leak information
   about the integers modulo p, for example by having b*c be
   distinguishable from c*c.  On some architectures, even primitive
   machine instructions, such as single-word division, can have variable
   timing based on their inputs.

   Side-channel attacks are an active research area that still sees
   significant, new results.  Implementors are advised to follow this
   research closely.

5.2.  Test vectors

   Two types of tests are provided.  The first is a pair of test vectors
   for each function that consist of expected outputs for the given
   inputs.  The inputs are generally given as 64 or 112 hexadecimal
   digits that need to be decoded as 32 or 56 binary bytes before
   processing.

6.  Diffie-Hellman

6.1.  Curve25519

   The X25519 function can be used in an elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) protocol as follows:

   Alice generates 32 random bytes in f[0] to f[31] and transmits K_A =
   X25519(f, 9) to Bob, where 9 is the u-coordinate of the base point
   and is encoded as a byte with value 9, followed by 31 zero bytes.

   Bob similarly generates 32 random bytes in g[0] to g[31] and computes
   K_B = X25519(g, 9) and transmits it to Alice.

   Using their generated values and the received input, Alice computes
   X25519(f, K_B) and Bob computes X25519(g, K_A).

   Both now share K = X25519(f, X25519(g, 9)) = X25519(g, X25519(f, 9))
   as a shared secret.  Both MUST check, without leaking extra
   information about the value of K, whether K is the all-zero value and
   abort if so (see below).  Alice and Bob can then use a key-derivation
   function that includes K, K_A and K_B to derive a key.

   The check for the all-zero value results from the fact that the
   X25519 function produces that value if it operates on an input
   corresponding to a point with order dividing the co-factor, h, of the

   curve.  This check is cheap and so MUST always be carried out.  The
   check may be performed by ORing all the bytes together and checking
   whether the result is zero as this eliminates standard side-channels
   in software implementations.

   Test vector:

   Alice's private key, f:

6.2.  Curve448

   The X448 function can be used in an ECDH protocol very much like the
   X25519 function.

   If X448 is to be used, the only differences are that Alice and Bob
   generate 56 random bytes (not 32) and calculate K_A = X448(f, 5) or
   K_B = X448(g, 5) where 5 is the u-coordinate of the base point and is
   encoded as a byte with value 5, followed by 55 zero bytes.

   As with X25519, both sides MUST check, without leaking extra
   information about the value of K, whether the resulting shared K is
   the all-zero value and abort if so.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security level (i.e. the number of "operations" needed for a
   brute-force attack on a primitive) of curve25519 is slightly under
   the standard 128-bit level.  This is acceptable because the standard
   security levels are primarily driven by much simplier, symmetric
   primitives where the security level naturally falls on a power of
   two.  For asymmetric primitives, rigidly adhering to a power-of-two
   security level would require compromises in other parts of the
   design, which we reject.  Additionally, comparing security levels
   between types of primitives can be misleading under common threat
   models where multiple targets can be attacked concurrently
   [bruteforce].

   The ~224-bit security level of curve448 is a trade-off between
   performance and paranoia.  Large quantum computers, if ever created,
   will break both curve25519 and curve448, and reasonable projections
   of the abilities of classical computers conclude that curve25519 is
   perfectly safe.  However, some designs have relaxed performance
   requirements and wish to hedge against some amount of analytical
   advance against elliptic curves and thus curve448 is also provided.

Appendix A.  Deterministic Generation

   This section specifies the procedure that was used to generate the
   above curves; specifically it defines how to generate the parameter A
   of the Montgomery curve y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x.  This procedure is
   intended to be as objective as can reasonably be achieved so that
   it's clear that no untoward considerations influenced the choice of
   curve.  The input to this process is p, the prime that defines the
   underlying field.  The size of p determines the amount of work needed
   to compute a discrete logarithm in the elliptic curve group and
   choosing a precise p depends on many implementation concerns.  The

   performance of the curve will be dominated by operations in GF(p) so
   carefully choosing a value that allows for easy reductions on the
   intended architecture is critical.  This document does not attempt to
   articulate all these considerations.

   The value (A-2)/4 is used in several of the elliptic curve point
   arithmetic formulas.  For simplicity and performance reasons, it is
   beneficial to make this constant small, i.e. to choose A so that
   (A-2) is a small integer which is divisible by four.

   For each curve at a specific security level:

   1.  The trace of Frobenius MUST NOT be in {0, 1} in order to rule out
       the attacks described in [smart], [satoh], and [semaev], as in
       [brainpool] and [safecurves].

   2.  MOV Degree [reducing]: the embedding degree k MUST be greater
       than (r - 1) / 100, as in [brainpool] and [safecurves].

   3.  CM Discriminant: discriminant D MUST be greater than 2^100, as in
       [safecurves].

A.1.  p = 1 mod 4

   For primes congruent to 1 mod 4, the minimal cofactors of the curve
   and its twist are either {4, 8} or {8, 4}. We choose a curve with the
   latter cofactors so that any algorithms that take the cofactor into
   account don't have to worry about checking for points on the twist,
   because the twist cofactor will be the smaller of the two.

   To generate the Montgomery curve we find the minimal, positive A
   value, such that A > 2 and (A-2) is divisible by four and where the
   cofactors are as desired.  The find1Mod4 function in the following
   Sage script returns this value given p:

       F = GF(prime)

       for A in xrange(3, 1e9):
           if (A-2) % 4 != 0:
             continue

             E = EllipticCurve(F, [0, A, 0, 1, 0])

                   Generating a curve where p = 1 mod 4

A.2.  p = 3 mod 4

   For a prime congruent to 3 mod 4, both the curve and twist cofactors
   can be 4 and this is minimal.  Thus we choose the curve with these
   cofactors and minimal, positive A such that A > 2 and (A-2) is
   divisible by four.  The find3Mod4 function in the following Sage
   script returns this value given p:

   def find3Mod4(prime):
       assert((prime % 4) == 3)
       return findCurve(prime, 4, 4)

                   Generating a curve where p = 3 mod 4

A.3.  Base points

   The base point for a curve is the point with minimal, positive u
   value that is in the correct subgroup.  The findBasepoint function in
   the following Sage script returns this value given p and A:
