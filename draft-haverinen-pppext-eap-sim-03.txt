1. Introduction 

   This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
   [1] mechanism for authentication and session key distribution using 
   the GSM Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). 

   GSM authentication is based on a challenge-response mechanism. The 
   authentication algorithm that runs on the SIM can be given a 128-bit 
   random number (RAND) as a challenge. The SIM runs an operator-
   specific confidential algorithm which takes the RAND and a secret 
   key Ki stored on the SIM as input, and produces a 32-bit response 
   (SRES) and a 64-bit long key Kc as output. The Kc key is originally 
   intended to be used as an encryption key over the air interface. 
   Please find more information about GSM authentication in [2]. 

   In EAP/SIM, several RAND challenges are used for generating several 
   64-bit Kc keys, which are combined to constitute a longer session 
   key. EAP/SIM also enhances the basic GSM authentication mechanism by 
   accompanying the RAND challenges with a message authentication code 
   in order to provide mutual authentication. 

   EAP/SIM specifies optional support for protecting the privacy of 
   subscriber identity.

3. Overview 

   Figure 1 shows an overview of the EAP/SIM authentication procedure. 
   This version of EAP/SIM exchange uses three roundtrips to authorize 
   the user and generate session keys. In this document, the term EAP 
   Server refers to the network element that terminates the EAP 
   protocol. The Authenticator typically communicates with the user's 
   EAP server using an AAA protocol. The AAA communications is not 
   shown in the figure. 

   The first EAP Request issued by the Authenticator is EAP-
   Request/Identity. The clients response includes the user's 
   International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) (Section 7). 

   Following the client's EAP-Response/Identity packet, the client 
   receives EAP Requests of type 18 (SIM) from the Authenticator and 
   sends the corresponding EAP Responses. The EAP packets that are of 
   the Type SIM also have a Subtype field. The first EAP-Request/SIM 
   packet is of the Subtype 10 (Start). Usually this packet contains no 
   attributes. (However, see Section 4 for an exception.) The client 
   responds with the EAP-Response/SIM/Start packet, which includes the 
   AT_NONCE_MT attribute that contains a random number NONCE_MT, picked 
   up by the client. 

   In this document, we assume that the EAP server has an interface to 
   the GSM network and it operates as a gateway between the Internet 
   AAA network and the GSM authentication infrastructure. After 
   receiving the EAP Response/SIM/Start, the EAP server obtains n GSM 
   triplets from the user's home operator's Authentication Centre (AuC) 
   on the GSM network. From the triplets, the EAP server derives the 
   keying material. Section 14 specifies how these cryptographic values 
   are calculated. 

   The next EAP Request the Authenticator issues is of the type SIM and 
   subtype Challenge (11). It contains the RAND challenges and a 
   message authentication code attribute AT_MAC to cover the 
   challenges. On receipt of this message, the client runs the GSM 
   authentication algorithm on the SIM card and calculates a copy of 
   the message authentication code. The client then verifies that the 
   calculated MAC equals the received MAC. If the MAC's do not match, 
   then the client silently ignores the EAP packet and does not send 
   any authentication values calculated on the SIM to the network. 
   Eventually, if another EAP-Request/SIM/Challenge packet with a valid 
   AT_MAC is not received, the connection establishment will time out. 

   Since the RAND's given to a client are accompanied with the message 
   authentication code AT_MAC, the client is able to verify that the 
   RAND's are fresh and they have been generated by the GSM network. 

   If all checks out, the client responds with the EAP-
   Response/SIM/Challenge, containing the client's response MAC_SRES 
   (Section 14). The EAP server verifies that the MAC_SRES is correct 
   and sends the EAP-Success packet, indicating that the authentication

   was successful. The EAP server may also include derived keying 
   material in the message it sends to the Authenticator.

4. Identity Privacy Support 

   In the very first connection to an EAP server, the client always 
   transmits the cleartext identity (IMSI) in the EAP-Response/Identity 
   packet. In subsequent connections, the optional identity privacy 
   support can be used to hide the IMSI and to make the connections 
   unlinkable to a passive eavesdropper. 

   The EAP-Request/SIM/Challenge message MAY include an encrypted 
   pseudonym in the value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute. The 
   AT_IV and AT_MAC attributes are also used to transport the pseudonym 
   to the client, as described in Section 10. Because the identity 
   privacy support is optional to implement, the client MAY ignore the

Internet Draft          EAP SIM Authentication           February 2002 
 
 
   AT_IV, AT_ENCR_DATA, and AT_MAC attributes and always transmit the 
   IMSI in the EAP-Response/Identity packet. 

   On receipt of the EAP-Request/SIM/Challenge, the client verifies the 
   AT_MAC attribute before looking at the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute. If 
   the AT_MAC is invalid, then the client MUST silently discard the EAP 
   packet. If the AT_MAC attribute is valid, then the client MAY 
   decrypt the encrypted data in AT_ENCR_DATA and use the obtained 
   pseudonym used in the next authentication. 

   The EAP server produces pseudonyms in an implementation-dependent 
   manner. Please see [4] for examples on how to produce pseudonyms. 
   Only the EAP server needs to be able to map the pseudonym to the 
   cleartext identity. Regardless of construction method, the pseudonym 
   MUST conform to the grammar specified for the username portion of an 
   NAI. 

   On the next connection to the EAP server, the client MAY transmit 
   the received pseudonym in the first EAP-Response/Identity packet. 
   The client concatenates the received pseudonym with the "@" 
   character and the NAI realm portion. The client MUST use the same 
   realm portion that it used in the connection when it received the 
   pseudonym. 

   If the EAP server successfully decodes the pseudonym to a known 
   client identity (IMSI), the authentication proceeds with the EAP-
   Request/SIM/Start message as usual. 

   If the EAP server fails to decode the pseudonym to a known identity, 
   then the EAP server requests the regular IMSI (non-pseudonym 
   identity) by including the AT_IDENTITY_REQ attribute (Section 8) in 
   the EAP-Request/SIM/Start message. The value field of the 
   AT_IDENTITY_REQ does not contain any data but the attribute is 
   included to request the client to include the AT_IDENTITY attribute 
   (Section 9) in the EAP-Response/SIM/Start message. The AT_IDENTITY 
   attribute contains the client's identity in the clear.  

   Please note that the EAP/SIM client and the EAP/SIM server only 
   process the AT_IDENTITY_REQ and AT_IDENTITY attributes and entities 
   that only pass through EAP packets do not process these attributes. 
   Hence, if the EAP server is not co-located in the authenticator, 
   then the authenticator and other intermediate AAA elements (such as 
   possible AAA proxy servers) will continue to refer to the client 
   with the original pseudonym identity from the EAP-Response/Identity 
   packet regardless if the decoding fails in the EAP server. 

   This case is illustrated in the figure below.

   After the EAP-Response/SIM/Start message, the authentication 
   sequence proceeds as usual with the EAP Server issuing the EAP-
   Request/SIM/Challenge message. 

5. Message Format 

   The Type-Data of the EAP/SIM packets begins with a 1-octet Subtype 
   field, which is followed by a 2-octet reserved field. The rest of 
   the Type-Data consists of attributes that are encoded in Type, 
   Length, Value format. The figure below shows the generic format of 
   an attribute. 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |      Type     |    Length     |  Value... 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    

   Attribute Type 

      Indicates the particular type of attribute. The attribute type 
      values are listed in Section 15.

Internet Draft          EAP SIM Authentication           February 2002 
 
 
   Length 

      Indicates the length of this attribute in multiples of four 
      bytes. The maximum length of an attribute is 1024 bytes. The 
      length includes the Attribute Type and Length bytes. 

   Value 

      The particular data associated with this attribute. This field is 
      always included and it may be two or more bytes in length. The 
      type and length fields determine the format and length of the 
      value field. 

   When an attribute numbered within the range 0 through 127 is 
   encountered but not recognized, the EAP/SIM message containing that 
   attribute MUST be silently discarded. These attributes are called 
   non-skippable attributes. 

   When an attribute numbered in the range 128 through 255 is 
   encountered but not recognized that particular attribute is ignored, 
   but the rest of the attributes and message data MUST still be 
   processed. The Length field of the attribute is used to skip the 
   attribute value in searching for the next attribute. These 
   attributes are called skippable attributes. 

   Unless otherwise specified, the order of the attributes in an 
   EAP/SIM message is insignificant, and an EAP/SIM implementation 
   should not assume a certain order to be used. 

   Attributes can be encapsulated within other attributes. In other 
   words, the value field of an attribute type can be specified to 
   contain other attributes. 

6. Message Integrity and Privacy Protection 

   This section specifies EAP/SIM attributes for attribute encryption 
   and EAP/SIM message integrity protection. 

   Because the K_encr and K_int keys derived from the RAND challenges 
   (as specified in Section 14)are required to process the integrity 
   protection and encryption attributes, these attributes can only be 
   used in the EAP-Request/SIM/Challenge message and any EAP/SIM 
   messages sent after EAP-Requets/SIM/Challenge. For example, these 
   attributes cannot be used in EAP-Request/SIM/Start. 

6.1. AT_MAC Attribute 

   The AT_MAC attribute can be used for EAP/SIM message integrity 
   protection. Whenever AT_ENCR_DATA (Section 6.2) is included in an 
   EAP message, it MUST be followed (not necessarily immediately) by an 
   AT_MAC attribute. Messages that do not meet this condition MUST be 
   silently discarded.

   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes 
   followed by a message authentication code (MAC). The MAC is 
   calculated over the whole EAP packet with the exception that the 
   value field of the MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the 
   MAC. The reserved bytes are set to zero when sending and ignored on 
   reception. The format of the AT_MAC attribute is shown below.

   The MAC algorithm is HMAC-SHA1 [9] keyed hash value, so the length 
   of the MAC is 20 bytes. The derivation of the integrity protection 
   key (K_int) used in the calculation of the MAC is specified in 
   Section 14.  

6.2. AT_IV and AT_ENCR_DATA Attributes 

   AT_IV and AT_ENCR_DATA attributes can be optionally used to transmit 
   encrypted information between the EAP/SIM client and server.  

   The value field of AT_IV contains two reserved bytes followed by a 
   16-byte initialization vector required by the AT_ENCR_DATA 
   attribute. The reserved bytes are set to zero when sending and 
   ignored on reception. The AT_IV attribute MUST be included if and 
   only if the AT_ENCR_DATA is included. Messages that do not meet this 
   condition MUST be silently discarded. The format of AT_IV is shown 
   below.

   The value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute consists of two 
   reserved bytes followed by bytes encrypted using the Advanced 
   Encryption Standard (AES) [7] in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) 
   mode of operation, using the initialization vector from the AT_IV

   The derivation of the encryption key (K_encr) is specified in 
   Section 14. 

   The plaintext consists of nested EAP/SIM attributes. 

7. EAP-Response/Identity 

   In the beginning of EAP authentication, the Authenticator issues the 
   EAP-Request/Identity packet to the client. The client responds with 
   EAP-Response/Identity, which contains the user's identity. The 
   formats of these packets are specified in [1]. 

   GSM subscribers are identified with the International Mobile 
   Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [5]. The IMSI is composed of a three 
   digit Mobile Country Code (MCC), a two digit Mobile Network Code 
   (MNC) and a not more than 10 digit Mobile Subscriber Identification 
   Number (MSIN). In other words, the IMSI is a string of not more than 
   15 digits. MCC and MNC uniquely identify the GSM operator. 

   Internet AAA protocols identify users with the Network Access 
   Identifier (NAI) [6]. When used in a roaming environment, the NAI is 
   composed of a username and a realm, separated with "@". The username 
   portion identifies the subscriber within the realm. The AAA nodes 
   use the realm portion of the NAI to route AAA requests to the 
   correct AAA server. Operators SHOULD reserve the realm portion of 
   NAI for EAP/SIM users exclusively, so that exactly the same realm is 
   not used with other authentication methods. This convention makes it 
   easy to recognize that the NAI identifies a GSM subscriber of this 
   operator, which may be useful when configuring the routing rules in 
   the visited AAA networks. 

   When the optional IMSI privacy support is not used, the client 
   transmits the user's IMSI as a NAI in the EAP Response/Identity 
   packet. The NAI is of the format "0imsi@realm". In other words, the 
   first character is the digit zero (ASCII value 0x30), followed by 
   the IMSI, followed by the @ character and the realm. The IMSI is an

   ASCII string that consists of not more than 15 decimal digits (ASCII 
   values between 0x30 and 0x39) as specified in [5]. 

   When the optional identity privacy support is used, the client MAY 
   use the pseudonym received as part of the previous authentication 
   sequence as the user name portion of the NAI, as specified in 
   Section 4. 

   The AAA network routes the AAA request to the correct AAA server 
   using the realm part of the NAI. The realm part MAY be a 
   configurable parameter in the EAP/SIM client implementation. In this 
   case, the client is typically configured with the NAI realm of the 
   home operator. Other ways to obtain the realm may later be specified 
   but they are not in the scope of this document.

   The first SIM specific EAP Request is of subtype Start. The format 
   of the EAP Request/SIM/Start packet is shown below.

   AT_IDENTITY_REQ 

      The AT_IDENTITY_REQ attribute is optional and it is included in 
      the cases defined in Section 4. The value field only contains two 
      reserved bytes, which are set to zero on sending and ignored on 
      reception.

   Reserved 

      Set to zero when sending, ignored on reception. 

   AT_NONCE_MT 

      The AT_NONCE_MT attribute MUST be included. The value field 
      contains two reserved bytes followed by a random number generated 
      by the client (16 bytes), which is used as a seed value for the 
      new key. The reserved bytes are set to zero upon sending and 
      ignored upon reception. 

   AT_IDENTITY 

      The AT_IDENTITY attribute is optional and it is included in cases 
      defined in Section 4. The value field of this attribute begins 
      with 2-byte actual identity length, which specifies the length of 
      the identity in bytes. This field is followed by the cleartext 
      Network Access Identitier username portion of the indicated 
      actual length. The username format is specified in Section 7. The 
      user name does not include any terminating null characters. 
      Because the length of the attribute must be a multiple of 4 
      bytes, the sender pads the identity with zero bytes when 
      necessary.

   AT_PSEUDONYM 

      The AT_PSEUDONYM attribute is optional. The value field of this 
      attribute begins with 2-byte actual pseudonym length, which 
      specifies the length of the pseudonym in bytes. This field is 
      followed by a pseudonym user name, of the indicated actual 
      length, that the client can use in the next authentication, as 
      described in Section 4. The user name does not include any 
      terminating null characters. Because the length of the attribute 
      must be a multiple of 4 bytes, the sender pads the pseudonym with 
      zero bytes when necessary.  

   AT_PADDING 

      The encryption algorithm requires the length of the plaintext to 
      be a multiple of 16 bytes. The sender may need to include the 
      AT_PADDING attribute as the last attribute within AT_ENCR_DATA. 
      The AT_PADDING attribute is not included if the total length of 
      other nested attributes within the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute is a 
      multiple of 16 bytes. As usual, the Length of the Padding 
      attribute includes the Attribute Type and Attribute Length 
      fields. The Length of the Padding attribute is 4, 8 or 12 bytes. 
      It is chosen so that the length of the value field of the 
      AT_ENCR_DATA attribute becomes a multiple of 16 bytes. The actual 
      pad bytes in the value field are set to zero (0x00) on sending. 
      The recipient of the message MUST verify that the pad bytes are 
      set to zero, and silently drop the message if this verification 
      fails. 

11. EAP-Response/SIM/Challenge 

   The format of the EAP-Response/SIM/Challenge packet is shown below. 

   As specified in Section 6, EAP-Response/SIM/Challenge MAY include 
   the AT_MAC attribute to integrity protect the EAP packet. Later

   attributes. AT_MAC, AT_ENCR_DATA and AT_IV attributes are not shown 
   in the figure below. If present, they are processed as in EAP-
   Request/SIM/Challenge packet. The EAP server MUST process EAP-
   Response/SIM/Challenge messages that include these attributes even 
   if the server did not implement these optional attributes.

      bytes. The reserved bytes are set to zero upon sending and 
      ignored upon reception. 

12. Unsuccessful Cases 

   As normally in EAP, the client is sent the EAP-Failure packet when 
   the authentication procedure fails on the EAP Server. In EAP/SIM, 
   this may occur for example if the EAP server is not able to obtain 
   the GSM triplets for the subscriber or the EAP server receives an 
   incorrect MAC_SRES. 

   In general, if an error occurs on the client while processing a 
   received EAP-Request packet, the client silently ignores the EAP 
   packet and does not send any EAP messages to the network. Examples 
   of such errors, specified in detail elsewhere in this document, are 
   an invalid AT_MAC value, insufficient number of RAND challenges 
   included in AT_RAND, and an unrecognized non-skippable attribute. 

   As specified in [1], the EAP client must respond with EAP-
   Response/Nak when it receives an EAP Request of an undesired or 
   unrecognized authentication type. 

13. EAP/SIM Notifications 

   The EAP-Request/Notification, specified in [1], can be used to 
   convey a displayable message from the authenticator to the client. 
   Because these messages are not localizable, EAP/SIM uses a separate 
   EAP/SIM message subtype to transmit localizable notification codes 
   instead of the EAP-Request/Notification packet. 

   The EAP server MAY issue an EAP-Request/SIM/Notification packet to 
   the client. The client MAY delay the processing of EAP-
   Request/SIM/Notification and wait for other EAP/SIM requests. If a 
   valid EAP/SIM request of another subtype is received, the client MAY 
   silently ignore the EAP-Request/SIM notification and process the 
   other EAP/SIM request instead. If the client decides to process the 
   EAP-Request/SIM/Notification, then the client MAY show a 
   notification message to the user and the client MUST respond to the 
   EAP server with an EAP-Response/SIM/Notification packet.  

   The format of the EAP-Request/SIM/Notification packet is shown 
   below.

14. Calculation of Cryptographic Values 

   This section specifies how keying material is generated and how the 
   message authentication code MAC_SRES is calculated. 

   When calculating these values, the IMSI is packed into 8 bytes. The 
   most significant nibble of the first byte is the first digit in the 
   IMSI, the least significant nibble the second digit in IMSI etc. The 
   least significant nibble of the 8th byte is 'F' as the IMSI 
   typically is 15 digits. Unused nibbles are filled with 'F' in case 
   the IMSI is less than 15 digits. For example, the IMSI 
   244070100000112 is coded as follows: the first byte is 0x24, the 
   second byte is 0x40, ..., and the eighth byte is 0x2F. 

   In the formulae, the notation prf(key, msg) denotes the keyed 
   pseudo-random function used to generate a deterministic output that 
   appears pseudo-random. The prf() is used both for key derivations 
   and for authentication (i.e. as a keyed MAC). The notation hash(msg) 
   denotes a one-way hash function of a message. In this version of 
   EAP/SIM, the prf () is HMAC-SHA1 [9], and the hash() is SHA-1 [10].

Internet Draft          EAP SIM Authentication           February 2002 
 
 
   First, a master key K_master is calculated as follows: 

   K_master 

      hash (n*Kc| NONCE_MT) 

   The master key is only used to derive other keying material with the 
   following key expansion scheme, which is similar to the keying 
   material derivation of Internet Key Exchange [11]. The following 
   formulae are used: 

   Key_block_0 

      prf(K_master, Client Identity | IMSI | 0) 

   Key_block_i, where i = 1, 2... 

      prf(K_master, Key_block_i-1 | Client Identity | IMSI| i) 

   The values of 0, 1, and 2 etc. above are represented by a single 
   octet. The client identity represents the string used as the client 
   identity in the EAP-Response/Identity message (Section 7). If a 
   pseudonym was used in the EAP-Response/Identity message, it is used 
   in this formula regardless of whether the EAP server recognized the 
   pseudonym. 

   The resulting material Key_block_0, Key_block_1, ... is then 
   partitioned into suitable-sized chunks and used as keys in the 
   following order: 

      K_sres (20 octets),  
      K_encr (16 octets),  
      K_int (20 octets), 
      EAP application specific keys 
       

   K_sres is used in the calculation of MAC_SRES as follows: 

   MAC_SRES 

      prf (K_sres, n*SRES | Message Subtype) 

   Message subtype above contains the contents of the Subtype field of 
   the EAP/SIM message (one octet), in which MAC_SRES parameter is 
   included. 

   The K_encr and K_int keys are the encryption and integrity 
   protection keys required for AT_ENCR_DATA and AT_MAC attributes.  





  
Haverinen               Expires in six months               [Page 21] 

Internet Draft          EAP SIM Authentication           February 2002 
 
 
   The keying material following K_int can be used as required by the 
   EAP application. Even if K_encr was not used in the particular 
   authentication sequence, it is derived and the EAP application 
   specific material begins after K_int.  

   For example, the EAP application specific material can be used for 
   packet security between the client and the authenticator. Because 
   the required keying material depends on the EAP application, exact 
   rules of key derivation cannot be given here. As a guideline, which 
   can be used applicable, the EAP application specific keys resulting 
   from the key expansion scheme is used in the following order: 

      any master session keys required, 
      any encryption keys required, 
      any integrity protection keys required, 
      any initialization vectors required 

   If separate keys or IV's are required for each direction, then the 
   downlink material (to protect traffic to user) is taken before the 
   uplink material (to protect traffic from user). 

   When generating K_master, the hash function is used as a mixing 
   function to combine several session keys (Kc's) generated by the GSM 
   authentication procedure and the random number NONCE_MT into a 
   single session key. There are several reasons for this. The current 
   GSM session keys are at most 64 bits, so two or more of them are 
   needed to generate a longer key. By using a one-way function to 
   combine the keys, we are assured that even if an attacker manages to 
   learn one of the EAP/SIM session keys, it doesn't help him in 
   learning the original GSM Kc's. In addition, since we include the 
   random number NONCE_MT in the calculation, the client is able to 
   verify that the SIM authentication values it receives from the 
   network are fresh and not a replay. (Please see also Section 16.) 

15. IANA Considerations 

   IANA has assigned the EAP type number 18 for this protocol.

   EAP/SIM messages include a Subtype field. The following Subtypes are 
   specified: 

        Start..........................................10 
        Challenge......................................11 
        Notification...................................12 
    
   The Subtype-specific data is composed of attributes, which have 
   attribute type numbers. The following attribute types are specified: 

        AT_RAND.........................................1 
        AT_IDENTITY.....................................5 
        AT_PADDING......................................6 
        AT_NONCE_MT.....................................7 
        AT_MAC_SRES.....................................9 
        AT_IDENTITY_REQ................................10 
        AT_MAC.........................................11 
        AT_NOTIFICATION................................12 
    
        AT_IV.........................................129 
        AT_ENCR_DATA..................................130 
        AT_PSEUDONYM..................................132 

   The AT_NOTIFICATION attribute contains a notification code value. 
   Values 1024, 1026 and 1031 have been specified in Section 13 of this 
   document. 

16. Security Considerations 

   The protocol in this document is intended to provide the appropriate 
   level of security to operate Extensible Authentication Protocol 
   using the GSM SIM. 

   EAP/SIM includes optional IMSI privacy support that protects the 
   privacy of the subscriber identity against passive eavesdropping. 
   The mechanism cannot be used on the first connection with a given 
   server, when the IMSI will have to be sent in the clear. EAP/SIM 
   does not protect the privacy of the IMSI against active attacks. An 
   active attacker that impersonates the network can easily learn the 
   subscriber's IMSI. This is the same level of protection as in the 
   GSM and UMTS cellular networks. 

   In EAP/SIM, the client believes that the network is authentic 
   because the network can calculate a correct AT_MAC value in the EAP-
   Request/SIM/Challenge packet. To calculate AT_MAC, it is sufficient 
   to know the complete GSM triplets (RAND, SRES, Kc) used in the 
   authentication. Because the network selects the RAND challenges and 
   hereby the triplets, an attacker that knows a GSM triplet for the 
   subscriber is able to impersonate a valid network to the client. 
   Given physical access to the SIM card, it is easy to obtain any 
   number of GSM triplets. Another way to obtain a RAND challenge and 
   the corresponding SRES response of a GSM triplet is to eavesdrop on 
   the GSM network. The corresponding Kc key could be obtained for

Internet Draft          EAP SIM Authentication           February 2002 
 
 
   example by cryptanalysing encrypted GSM traffic. (Of course, this 
   can be used to attack EAP/SIM only if the same SIM card is used both 
   for GSM network access and for EAP/SIM.) For these reasons, network 
   authentication of EAP/SIM SHOULD NOT be used exclusively if strong 
   network authentication is a concern. 

   There is no known way to obtain complete GSM triplets by mounting an 
   attack against EAP/SIM. A passive eavesdropper can learn n*RAND, 
   AT_MAC and AT_MAC_SRES, and may be able to link this information to 
   the subscriber identity. An active attacker that impersonates a GSM 
   subscriber can easily obtain n*RAND and AT_MAC values from the EAP 
   server for any given subscriber identity. However, calculating the 
   Kc and SRES values from AT_MAC and MAC_SRES would require the 
   attacker to reverse the keyed message authentication code function 
   HMAC-SHA1. 

   EAP/SIM combines several GSM triplets in order to generate a 
   stronger session key and stronger AT_MAC and AT_MAC_SRES values. The 
   actual strength of the resulting key depends, among other things, on 
   the operator-specific authentication algorithms, the strength of the 
   Ki key, and the quality of the RAND challenges, which is also 
   operator specific. For example, some SIM cards generate Kc keys with 
   10 bits set to zero. Such restrictions may prevent the concatenation 
   technique from yielding strong session keys. 

   An EAP/SIM implementation SHOULD use a good source of randomness to 
   generate the random numbers required in the protocol. Please see 
   [12] for more information on generating random numbers for security 
   applications.
