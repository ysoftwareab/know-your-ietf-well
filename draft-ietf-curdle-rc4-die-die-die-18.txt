                 Deprecating RC4 in Secure Shell (SSH)
                  draft-ietf-curdle-rc4-die-die-die-18

Abstract

   This document deprecates RC4 in Secure Shell (SSH).  Therefore, this
   document formally moves RFC4345 to historic status.

1.  Introduction

   The usage of RC4 suites ( also designated as arcfour ) for SSH are
   specified in [RFC4253] and [RFC4345].  [RFC4253] specifies the
   allocation of the "arcfour" cipher for SSH.  [RFC4345] specifies and
   allocates the "arcfour128" and "arcfour256" ciphers for SSH.  RC4
   encryption has known weaknesses [RFC7465] [RFC8429], and the
   deprecation process should be begun for their use in Secure Shell
   (SSH) [RFC4253].  Accordingly, [RFC4253] is updated to note the
   deprecation of the RC4 ciphers and [RFC4345] is moved to Historic as
   all ciphers it specifies MUST NOT be used.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]RFC
   8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

2.  Updates to RFC 4253

   [RFC4253] is updated to prohibit arcfour's use in SSH.  [RFC4253]
   allocates the "arcfour" cipher in Section 6.3 by defining a list of
   defined ciphers where the "arcfour" cipher appears as optional as
   mentioned below:

   +---------------+-----------------+---------------------------------+
   | arcfour       | OPTIONAL        | the ARCFOUR stream cipher with  |
   |               |                 | a 128-bit key                   |
   +---------------+-----------------+---------------------------------+

   This current document updates the status of the "arcfour" ciphers in
   the list of [RFC4253] Section 6.3 by moving it from OPTIONAL to MUST
   NOT.

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-curdle-rc4-die-die-die      November 2019


   +-----------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
   |  arcfour  | MUST NOT  |  the ARCFOUR stream cipher with a 128-bit |
   |           |           | key                                       |
   +-----------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+

   [RFC4253] defines the "arcfour" ciphers with the text mentioned
   below:

   The "arcfour" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit keys.
   The Arcfour cipher is compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER].
   Arcfour (and RC4) has problems with weak keys, and should be used
   with caution.

   This current document updates [RFC4253] Section 6.3 by replacing the
   text above with the following text:

   The "arcfour" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit keys.
   The Arcfour cipher is compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER].
   Arcfour (and RC4) has known weaknesses [RFC7465] [RFC8429], and MUST
   NOT be used.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to update the Encryption Algorithm Name
   Registry of the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters [IANA].  The
   Registration procedure is IETF Review which is achieved by this
   document.  The registry should be updated as follows:

        +------------------------------+---------------+---------+
        | Encryption  Algorithm  Name  |  Reference    |    Note |
        +------------------------------+---------------+---------+
        | arcfour                      |  [RFC-TBD]    |         |
        | arcfour128                   |    [RFC-TBD]  |         |
        | arcfour256                   |    [RFC-TBD]  |         |
        +------------------------------+---------------+---------+

   Where TBD is the RFC number assigned to the document.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document only prohibits the use of RC4 in SSH, and introduces no
   new security considerations.
