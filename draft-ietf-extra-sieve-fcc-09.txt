                Sieve Extension: File Carbon Copy (Fcc)
                     draft-ietf-extra-sieve-fcc-09

Abstract

   The Sieve Email Filtering Language provides a number of action
   commands, some of which can generate additional messages on behalf of
   the user.  This document defines an extension to such commands to
   allow a copy of any generated message to be filed into a target
   mailbox.

   This document updates RFC5230 and RFC5435 by adding a new tagged
   argument to the "vacation" and "enotify" actions respectively.

1.  Introduction

   The Sieve Email Filtering Language [RFC5228] provides a number of
   action commands, some of which can generate additional messages on
   behalf of the user.  It is sometimes desirable for a Sieve user to
   maintain an archive of the messages generated by these commands.

   This extension defines a new optional tagged argument ":fcc" to
   action commands that generate additional messages to allow a copy of
   the generated message to be filed into a target mailbox.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                   January 2019


   The capability string associated with this extension is "fcc".

   Each new action that generates additional messages will need to
   specify how it interacts with :fcc.  This document specifies the
   interaction of :fcc with the Vacation [RFC5230] and Notify [RFC5435]
   extensions.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Conventions for notations are as in Section 1.1 of [RFC5228],
   including use of the "Usage:" label for the definition of action and
   tagged arguments syntax.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [1] [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Tagged Argument ":fcc"

   This document specifies a new optional tagged argument ":fcc" that
   alters the behavior of action commands that generate additional
   messages on behalf of the user.

   Usage: :fcc <mailbox: string>

   The :fcc tagged argument instructs the Sieve interpreter to file a
   copy of the generated message into the mailbox provided in the
   subsequent argument.  The semantics and treatment of the mailbox
   argument are defined to match those of the mailbox argument to the
   "fileinto" action specified in Section 4.1 of [RFC5228].
   Specifically, use of an invalid mailbox name MAY be treated as an
   error or result in delivery to an implementation-defined mailbox, and
   if the specified mailbox doesn't exist, the implementation MAY treat
   it as an error, create the mailbox, or file the message into an
   implementation-defined mailbox.

3.1.  Interaction with Fileinto Extensions

   Some tagged arguments defined in extensions to the "fileinto" action
   can be used together with ":fcc".  The sections below describe these
   interactions.  Tagged arguments in future extensions to the
   "fileinto" action need to describe their interaction with ":fcc", if
   any.

   When any "fileinto" extension arguments are used with ":fcc", the
   corresponding extension MUST be enabled, and the arguments are



Murchison & Gondwana      Expires July 17, 2019                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                   January 2019


   defined to have the same syntax, semantics, and treatment as they do
   with "fileinto".

3.1.1.  Imap4flags Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":flags" tagged argument
   (see Section 5 of [RFC5232]) so that it can optionally be used with
   the ":fcc" argument.

   Usage: :fcc <mailbox: string> [:flags <list-of-flags: string-list>]

   If the optional ":flags" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to set the IMAP4 flags provided in
   the subsequent argument when the generated message is filed into the
   target mailbox.

3.1.2.  Mailbox Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":create" tagged argument
   (see Section 3.2 of [RFC5490]) so that it can optionally be used with
   the ":fcc" argument.

   Usage: :fcc <mailbox: string> [:create]

   If the optional ":create" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to create the target mailbox, if
   needed, before attempting to file the generated message into the
   target mailbox.

3.1.3.  Special-Use Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":specialuse" tagged
   argument (see Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use]) so
   that it can optionally be used with the ":fcc" argument.

  Usage: :fcc <mailbox: string> [:specialuse <special-use-flag: string>]

   If the optional ":specialuse" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to check whether a mailbox exists
   with the specific special-use flag assigned to it.  If such a mailbox
   exists, the generated message is filed into the special-use mailbox.
   Otherwise, the generated message is filed into the target mailbox.

   If both the optional ":specialuse" and ":create" arguments are
   specified with ":fcc", the Sieve interpreter is instructed to create
   the target mailbox per Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use], if needed.

3.2.  Collected Grammar

   For convenience, the "FCC" syntax element is defined here using ABNF
   [RFC5234] so that it can be augmented by other extensions.

   Note that the following is the grammar of "FCC" after it has been
   lexically interpreted.  No whitespace or comments appear below.

   FCC         = ":fcc" string *FCC-OPTS
                   ; per Section 2.6.2 of RFC5228,
                   ; the tagged arguments in FCC may appear in any order

   FCC-OPTS    = CREATE / IMAP-FLAGS / SPECIAL-USE
                   ; each option MUST NOT appear more than once

   CREATE      = ":create"
   IMAP-FLAGS  = ":flags" string-list
   SPECIAL-USE = ":specialuse" string

4.  Format of File Carbon Copied Messages

   Copies of messages filed into a mailbox via this extension are
   REQUIRED to be in Internet Message Format [RFC5322].  Some messages
   generated by Sieve actions might already conform to this format and
   MAY be filed without modification.  Messages generated in other
   formats MUST be encapsulated using constructs from [RFC5322] and MIME
   ([RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2047], [RFC2231]).

   The general requirements for encapsulating the copies of messages to
   be filed are the following:

   o  Date: The Date header field is REQUIRED and SHOULD be set to the
      date and time when the message was generated.

   o  From: The From header field is REQUIRED and SHOULD be set to the
      email address of the owner of the Sieve script, unless explicitly
      overridden by rules for encapsulating a particular message type.

   o  To: The To header field is OPTIONAL and MAY be set to the email
      address of the recipient of the generated message, if available.

   o  Subject: The Subject header field is OPTIONAL and MAY be generated
      as follows: The subject is set to the characters "Fcc: " followed
      by the subject of the message being processed by the Sieve
      interpreter.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                   January 2019


   o  In-Reply-To: The In-Reply-To header field is OPTIONAL and MAY be
      set to the Message-ID of the message being processed by the Sieve
      interpreter.

   o  Message Body: The body of the filed message is REQUIRED and is
      composed of one or more MIME-parts containing the generated
      message and any related metadata.  The Content-Type header
      field(s) MUST be set to the appropriate MIME types.  If any of the
      MIME-parts include 8-bit or binary data, the Content-Transfer-
      Encoding header field(s) MUST be set accordingly.

5.  Interaction with the Vacation Action

   This document extends the "vacation" [RFC5230] action (see also
   "vacation-seconds" [RFC6131]) to optionally store a copy of the auto-
   reply messages into a target mailbox.

   Usage:   vacation [FCC]
                     [":days" number | ":seconds" number]
                     [":subject" string]
                     [":from" string]
                     [":addresses" string-list]
                     [":mime"]
                     [":handle" string]
                     <reason: string>

   Example (with fileinto extensions):

   require ["vacation", "fcc", "mailbox", "special-use", "imap4flags"];

   vacation :days 7
            :from "hemingway@example.com" "Gone Fishin'"
            :specialuse "\\Sent" :create
            :fcc "INBOX.Sent" :flags ["\\Seen"];


   Vacation auto-reply messages are MIME-compliant and can be filed into
   the target mailbox without modification.

6.  Interaction with the Notify Action

   This document extends the "notify" [RFC5435] action to optionally
   store a copy of the notification messages into a target mailbox.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                   January 2019


   Usage:   notify [FCC]
                   [":from" string]
                   [":importance" <"1" / "2" / "3">]
                   [":options" string-list]
                   [":message" string]
                   <method: string>

   Example:

   require ["enotify", "fcc"];

   notify :fcc "INBOX.Sent"
          :message "You got mail!"
          "mailto:ken@example.com";

   Messages generated using the "mailto" [RFC5436] notification method
   are MIME-compliant and can be filed into the target mailbox without
   modification.

   Messages generated by other notification methods (e.g. "xmpp"
   [RFC5437]) MUST be encapsulated per Section 4 before being filed.
   The body of the filed message MUST include the :message parameter and
   MAY include one or more of the :from, :importance, or :options
   parameters.  The MIME-type(s) of the body part(s) used to encapsulate
   the parameters is an implementation decision.

   An implementation MAY only support :fcc in conjunction with a subset
   of the notification methods it supports.  An error occurs if :fcc is
   combined with a notification method that doesn't support it.
   Notification methods that support :fcc can be discovered at run-time
   using the mechanism described below (Section 6.1).

6.1.  Notification-Capability "fcc"

   This document defines a new notification-capability value "fcc" for
   use with the notify_method_capability test (see Section 5 of
   [RFC5435].  For the "fcc" notification-capability, the
   notify_method_capability test can match one of the following key-list
   values:

   yes  A copy of the notification message sent using the method
      identified by the notification-uri can be filed into a target
      mailbox.

   no A copy of the notification message sent using the method
      identified by the notification-uri can not be filed into a target
      mailbox.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                   January 2019


   Note that the "fcc" notify_method_capability test does not require
   the notification-uri argument to specify anything other than a
   scheme.

   Example:

   require ["enotify", "fcc"];

   if notify_method_capability "xmpp:" "fcc" "yes" {
       notify :fcc "INBOX.Sent"
              :message "You got mail"
              "xmpp:ken@example.com?message;subject=SIEVE";
   } else {
       notify :fcc "INBOX.Sent"
              :message "You got mail!"
              "mailto:ken@example.com";
   }

7.  Compatibility with the Reject and Extended Reject Actions

   Implementations MUST NOT allow use of "fcc" with the "reject" and
   "ereject" [RFC5429] actions.  Allowing "fcc" with these actions would
   violate the SMTP [RFC5321] principle that a message is either
   delivered or bounced back to the sender.  Namely, the saved copy of
   the rejection message will contain the original message.

   It is an error for a script to use the ":fcc" tagged argument with
   either "reject" or "ereject".

8.  Compatibility with Other Actions

   The "fcc" extension is not compatible with any Sieve action that does
   not generate an additional message on behalf of the user.  It is an
   error for a script to use the ":fcc" tagged argument with any such
   action.

   Future extensions that define actions that generate additional
   messages on behalf of the user need to describe their compatibility
   with ":fcc", and how to MIME-encapsulate the message, if required.

9.  Implementation Status

   < RFC Editor: before publication please remove this section and the
   reference to [RFC7942] >

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].

   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

9.1.  Cyrus Server

   The open source Cyrus Server [2] project is a highly scalable
   enterprise mail system which supports Sieve email filtering at the
   point of final delivery.  This production level Sieve implementation
   supports all of the requirements described in this document.  This
   implementation is freely distributable under a BSD style license from
   Computing Services at Carnegie Mellon University [3].

9.2.  Oracle Communications Messaging Server

   The Oracle Communications Messaging Server [4] is a highly scalable,
   reliable, and available messaging platform.  This production level
   product supports the :fcc extension in conjunction with both the
   notify and vacation extensions.  The implementation meets all the
   requirements given in this document.  The product also supports the
   imap4flags extension so the :flags may be used in conjunction :fcc.

10.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations in [RFC5228], [RFC5230],
   [RFC5435], and [RFC6131], it should be noted that filing copies of
   generated messages may cause the Sieve script owner to exceed their
   allocated storage (quota) on the mail system, thereby preventing
   delivery of future messages destined for the owner.

11.  Privacy Considerations

   In addition to the privacy considerations in [RFC5228], [RFC5230],
   [RFC5435], and [RFC6131], it should be noted that a copy of a
   generated message filed into a shared or public maibox (as opposed to

   a private mailbox) could expose private information about the Sieve
   script owner to third parties.  For instance, users that have access
   to the shared/public mailbox might discover that the Sieve script
   owner is on holiday or might discover the owner's physical location.
