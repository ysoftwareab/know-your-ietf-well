     1. Introduction 

        This document shows the message flows associated with the most 
        relevant SPEERMINT routing architecture peering scenarios. Most of 
        the message diagrams were based on previous work described within 
        existing IETF standards documents.  

        The document focuses on the messages exchanged for the purpose of 
        Layer 5 peering [7] between two domains.  Messages exchanged for the 
        purpose of setting up SIP sessions within a domain are considered out 
        of scope and are already defined in other IETF documents.   

     2. Definitions 

        SSP: SIP Service Provider, the administrative entity providing SIP 
             services utilizing SIP.  Note that an SSP may be a traditional 
             Service Provider, an Enterprise, or any administrative domain 
             context. 
         
        LUF: Look-Up Function, the functional step(s) necessary to determine 
             for a given SIP request, which terminating domain it should be 
             sent to. 
         
        LRF: Location Routing Function, the functional step(s) necessary to 
             determine for a given SIP request's terminating domain, the path 
             to follow to reach the terminating domain. 
         
        Routing: In the context of this document, it is forwarding of an out-
             of-dialog SIP request. 
         
        SED: Session Establishment Data, the LUF and LRF data needed and used 
             to route a SIP request to the next-hop(s) associated with 
             reaching the terminating domain. 
         
        SBE: Signaling-path Border Element, the logical SIP node that 
             represents the logical boundaries between SSP domains (a.k.a., 
             the signaling portion of an SBC, I-BCF, etc.). 
         
        SF:  Signaling Function, the logical functional role for processing 
             SIP requests for peering/routing; i.e., the SBE's role.

        DBE: Data-path Border Element, the logical node that relays media 
             between the logical boundaries of SSP domains (a.k.a., the media 
             portion of an SBC, I-BGF, etc.). 
         
        MF:  Media Function, the logical functional role for processing media 
             for peering purposes, including relaying media; i.e., the DBE's 
             role. 
         

     3. Peering Scenarios 

        This draft separates the Layer 5 peering scenarios into two major    
        peering scenarios:  

        o  On-demand: In this scenario the SIP proxies in domains A and B 
           establish a peering relationship driven by the necessity to 
           deliver a SIP message to another domain, without a pre-existing 
           relationship.  This is sometimes referred as the "email" model.   

        o  Static: In this scenario the peering relationship between proxies 
           A and B is statically pre-provisioned independent of the 
           establishment of any SIP session between users in different 
           domains.  

        Media for a given SIP session may follow a different path from 
        signaling, only following the IP routed transport path when crossing 
        peering domains.  Alternatively, media for a given session can be 
        directed to traverse the same SIP device used for Layer 5 peering, 
        i.e., the same device that handles signaling when crossing domains. 
        This produces three different models:  

        o  Media-direct: In this model SIP proxies perform Layer 5 peering 
           Signaling Function (SF), while media is sent directly between the 
           User Agent's (UA's) involved in the session, as shown in Figure 1.  
           Therefore signaling and media follow different paths.  

        o  Integrated: In this model, the device that performs Layer 5 SIP 
           peering SF/SBE also processes the associated media when crossing 
           domains, as an MF/DBE, as shown in Figure 2.  This function is 
           usually referred to as media relay and is usually performed by a 
           B2BUA or SBC (Session Border Controller).  See [6] for a complete 
           discussion of such SBC functions.  We will refer to this picture 
           throughout this document.

        o  Decomposed: In this model, media is relayed by a DBE/MF which is 
           physically separated from the SBE/SF.  A control protocol, 
           typically H.248 or MGCP, is used by the SBE to control the DBE.  
           From the UA and peering domain's perspective, the decomposed SBE 
           and DBE do not function any differently than an integrated SBC.  
           For the purposes of this document, one can consider this model as 
           just a specific variant of the integrated model, and is not 
           discussed separately.

                        Figure 2: Integrated Peering Picture 

        In a decomposed model, the Signaling Function (SF) of an SBE, and the 
        Media Function (MF) of a DBE, are implemented in separate physical 
        entities.  A B2BUA is generally on the SIP path performing the SF.  A 
        vertical control protocol between the SF and MF is out of the scope 
        of this document.  

     4. Basic Peering Message Flow 

        This section depicts the "basic" Peering message flow.  This does not 
        imply this is the most common peering scenario - just a baseline.

        The various scenarios differ mostly of how and when peering is 
        implemented. As stated earlier, peering can be establish dynamically 
        following the arrival of a message at a border proxy, or statically 
        based on an agreement between both domains.

        In the integrated model, media would follow the path shown below. All 
        other signaling call flows remain the same.  In the decomposed model, 
        the media would also go to a MF/DBE functional entity, but it would 
        just be physically separate from the SF/SBE.

     5. On-Demand Peering 

        In the on-demand peering scenario, the relationship between proxies 
        in domains A and B is driven by the arrival of a SIP message at proxy 
        A directed to a user in domain B (or vice-versa). 

     5.1. Transport Layer Security  

        In case this is in fact the first SIP request between two SSPs in an 
        on-demand peering relationship, then the SIP request will trigger the 
        establishment of the TLS connection.  Otherwise it is assumed the TLS 
        connection has been established by some other means and may be 
        reused.

     6. Static Peering 

        In the static peering scenario the relationship between proxies A and 
        B is not driven by a SIP request, but before-hand through manual 
        provisioning. 

     6.1. TLS  

        In this model a TLS connection between proxies A and B is provisioned 
        following an agreement between the two domains.  Creation of the TLS 
        connection may be established through previous SIP message exchanges, 
        or by continuous message exchange such as OPTIONS requests/responses.  
        If Mutual-TLS is used, reverse-path requests may use the same 
        connection as defined in [13], or separate TLS connections may be 
        used for each request direction.

     6.2. IPsec  

        In this model an IPSec connection between proxies A and B is 
        provisioned following an agreement between the two domains.  
        Typically either transport-mode ESP is used for SIP signaling only, 
        or tunnel-mode is used for either just signaling, or both signaling 
        and media.  If tunneling is used, media-relay must be performed as 
        described later.  No diagram is shown for the IPsec case, since the 
        changes are only at the network layer. 

     6.3. Co-Location  

        In this scenario the two proxies are co-located in a physically 
        secure location and/or are members of a segregated network, such as a 
        VPN. In this case messages between Proxy 1 and Proxy 2 would be sent

     7. Federation Based Peering 

        Multiple SSP's may be members of the same Federation, such that their 
        policies and relationships are defined to be the same for a given 
        federation.  Federations are one way for a source and destination 
        network to find a common set of procedures for peering.

     7.1. Central Federation Proxy 

        Federation rules can dictate that calls are to be routed via a 
        federation-maintained central SIP proxy. In that case no further 
        NAPTR/SRV/A lookups need be made.  Instead, the INVITE will be sent 
        directly via a preconfigured connection to that proxy.  This proxy 
        acts as a redirect proxy, returning SIP 3xx responses with the 
        Contact URI(s) identifying the next target(s), which may need 
        subsequent DNS resolution per RFC 3263 to resolve.  The SIP Redirect 
        proxy essentially performs the role of the LUF and potentially the 
        LRF, using SIP as the query protocol. 

        The following message flow provides an example describing this 
        process:

     7.2. Central ENUM Federation 

        Another form of centralized Federation is to use an ENUM 
        infrastructure instead of SIP Redirect Proxy, and thus DNS as the 
        query protocol for the LUF, and possibly LRF.  The originating SSP 
        performs a NAPTR query to a pre-arranged ENUM server (a private DNS 
        server deployed for this role), for the destination calling party 
        E.164 number, with a private domain root for the Federation. 

        If the ENUM server provides just an LUF function, it will provide SED 
        data identifying the terminating SSP domain, and any number 
        portability data required, in its NAPTR response; but then relies on 
        the originating SSP to either know how to reach the terminating 
        domain or to perform some means of performing the LRF.  If the ENUM 
        serve provides both, it will resolve not only the number portability 
        information, if any, but also return the next-hop URI target(s) for 
        the originating SSP to send the SIP request to. 

        The following diagram shows a scenario whereby the originating SSP 
        performs an LUF query using ENUM-DNS to a central Federation ENUM 
        server, which responds with the resolved peer SSP's domain.  In this 
        particular case the originating SSP can reach the terminating SSP 
        directly, and happens to perform just a DNS request to resolve the 
        connection information for the Peer, to reach the Peer's SF-2 SBE.  
        This is only one particular scenario - many others are possible.

     8. Media Relay  

        In the event that a source and/or destination SSP are part of a 
        private network, or peer through a private network, the SSP peers 
      
      
     Kaplan, et al            Expires May 3, 2009                  [Page 14]

        must enable the SIP signaling and media to route between the peers.  
        This process is implemented by an SBE and DBE, either in an 
        integrated or decomposed model.  The core of the process is media 
        relaying, whereby the SBE forces the relay of media through its DBE 
        by modifying the SDP.   

      
     9. Peering Message Flow Phases 

        The message flow phases are Discovery, Security Establishment, 
        Signaling Exchange, and Media Exchange.  The following flow provides 
        an overview of the phases.  Each of the phases is described 
        individually in the following subsections.  For the following 
        diagram, the signaling and media exchange phase descriptions have 
        been omitted for clarity purposes, because their functionality has 
        not changed for the purposes of peering.  However, they have been 
        explained further in the following subsections.

     9.1. Discovery Phase 

        The first phase of static or dynamic peering requests is discovery.  
        The discovery process can be summarized by querying the Location 
        Routing Function (LRF) to determine the next phase in the message 
        flow.  The discovery phase can take place via a local or external 
        federation location function.  Examples of the function may be 
        comprised of an ENUM/DNS or redirect server.  After the discovery 
        phase has completed, the peering process will progress to a 
        subsequent phase, usually the policy or authentication phase.  The 
        following message flows provide examples of the discovery phase.

        The security establishment phase follows the described methods in 
        previous sections of this document.  This phase follows standard 
        methods described in [2], so the following flow provides an example 
        of this phase, but does not incorporate all possibilities.  This 
        phase assumes the previous phases were successfully completed or 
        purposefully omitted per peering implementation.

     10. Security Considerations 

        The level of security required during the establishment and 
        maintenance of a SIP peering relationship between two proxies can 

      
      
     Kaplan, et al            Expires May 3, 2009                  [Page 19] 
     Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-speermint-flows-04         November 2008 
         

        vary greatly. In general all security considerations related to the 
        SIP protocol are also applicable in a peering relationship.  

        If the two proxies communicate over an insecure network, and   
        consequently are subject to attacks/eavesdropping/etc., the use of 
        TLS or IPSec would be advisable.  

        If there is physical security and the proxies are co-located, or the 
        proxies are situated in a segregated network (such as a VPN), one 
        could argue that weaker measures are sufficient.
