  1.      Abstract 
      
     This document describes an architectural framework for locating 
     and retrieving information about network resources, using LDAPv3 
     for the data-formatting and query-processing services. This 
     document also defines LDAP schema and searching rules for four 
     Internet resource types: DNS domains, IPv4 addresses, IPv6 
     address, and AS numbers. The framework specified in this document 
     also allows additional documents to define additional Internet 
     resource types and their handling rules.

  2.      Definitions and Terminology 
      
     This document unites, enhances and clarifies several pre-existing 
     technologies. Readers are expected to be familiar with the 
     following specifications: 
      
            RFC 2247 - Using Domains in LDAP/X.500 DNs 
      
            RFC 2251 - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3) 
      
            RFC 2252 - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): 
            Attribute Syntax Definitions. 
      
            RFC 2254 - The String Representation of LDAP Search Filters 
      
            RFC 2256 - A Summary of the X.500(96) User Schema for use 
            with LDAPv3 
      
            RFC 2798 - Definition of the inetOrgPerson LDAP Object 
            Class 
      
            [namedref] - <draft-zeilenga-ldap-namedref-04.txt> - Named 
            Subordinate References in LDAP Directories 
      
            [ir-dir-req] - <draft-newton-ir-dir-requirements-00.txt> - 
            Internet Registry Directory Requirements 
      
     The following abbreviations are used throughout this document: 
      
            DIT (Directory Information Tree) - A DIT is a contained 
            branch of the LDAP namespace, having a root of a particular 
            distinguished name. "dc=example,dc=com" is used throughout 
            this document as one DIT, with many example entries being 
            stored in this DIT. 
      
            DN (Distinguished Name) - A distinguished name provides a 
            unique identifier for an entry, through the use of a multi-
            level naming syntax. Entries are named according to their 
            location relevant to the root of their containing DIT. For 
            example, "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" is a DN which 
            uniquely identifies the "inetResources" entry within the 
            "dc=example,dc=com" DIT. 
      
            RDN (Relative DN) - An RDN provides a locally-scoped unique 
            identifier for an entry. A complete, globally-unique DN is

            formed by concatenating the RDNs of an entry together. For 
            example, "cn=admins,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" 
            consists of two RDNs ("cn=admins" and "cn=inetResources") 
            within the "dc=example,dc=com" DIT. RDNs are typically only 
            referenced within their local scope. 
      
            OID (Object Identifier) - An OID is a globally-unique, 
            concatenated set of integers which provide a kind of 
            "serial number" to attributes, object classes, syntaxes and 
            other schema elements. 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
      
      
  3.      Background, Objectives and Overview 
      
  3.1.    Background 
      
     The WHOIS service was originally provided as a front-end to a 
     centralized repository of ARPANET resources and users. Over time, 
     multiple WHOIS information servers have been deployed which 
     provide other kinds of information for various types of Internet 
     resources. 
      
     For example, there are scores of WHOIS servers which serve one or 
     more of the top-level domains ("com", "jp", etc.), with each 
     server providing information about the sub-domains that have been 
     delegated beneath each of the managed TLDs, and which also provide 
     information about the human operators of those domains, among 
     other details. Similarly, there are WHOIS servers which provide 
     information about different portions of the IPv4 address space. 
     Similarly, there are WHOIS servers which are operated by service 
     providers which provide information about the resources in use by 
     that organization and its customers. All told, there are hundreds 
     of WHOIS servers available on the public Internet, with each 
     server providing general information about the particular network 
     resources under the control of each organization. 
      
     Unfortunately, the WHOIS specification does not define a strict 
     set of data-typing or formatting requirements, and as a result, 
     each of the different implementations provide information in 
     slightly different ways. Some servers provide limited amounts of 
     unstructured information, while others provide information in a 
     highly-detailed and highly-structured form. Similarly, some 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002              [page 4] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     servers provide information in only one language and charset, 
     while others support multiple languages and charsets, and use 
     input switches to control the output format. Essentially, every 
     WHOIS server has its own data formats and syntaxes, with little 
     consistency between them, which has made programmatic processing 
     of the data difficult. 
      
     Furthermore, each WHOIS server operates as a self-contained 
     entity, with no knowledge or linkage between the different 
     servers, meaning that WHOIS servers cannot redirect clients to 
     other servers for additional information. 
      
     Another concern is that the WHOIS services which are being 
     operated today offer no means of client authentication, requiring 
     that server operators essentially publish all data with a single 
     "world-readable" permission. However, this single permission 
     conflicts with the privacy and security policies of specific 
     jurisdictions. A more flexible mechanism for controlling the 
     release of physical and personal information is required in order 
     to meet the requirements of the varying constituencies. 
      
     There are many other secondary issues with the WHOIS service as it 
     exists in current form. However, the largest problems are a lack 
     of standardized data formats, a lack of widely-supported referral 
     mechanisms, and lack of privacy and security controls, as 
     described in the preceding text. 
      
     This document attempts to address these issues by defining 
     operational and protocol guidelines for a distributed and highly-
     structured WHOIS-like service, using the LDAP protocol for the 
     query/response transfer service, and using LDAP schema for the 
     search inputs, answer data, and redirection mechanisms. In short, 
     the intention of this approach is to provide an extensible and 
     scalable WHOIS service, leveraging the capabilities of LDAP. 
      
      
  3.2.    Overview 
      
     This document defines four basic service components and their 
     interaction as part of a distributed resource-locator service. 
     Each of these components work together to provide a structured and 
     distributed resource-locator service. 
      
     Specifically, this document only defines the elements which govern 
     the core service. Separate documents define the individual 
     resource types, their schema and matching filters, and so forth.

     As such, the architecture and protocols defined in this 
     specification are purposefully designed to be capable of 
     accommodating a variety of different data-types and usage models, 
     including future uses which are not defined here. 
      
     The four components of the core service model are: 
      
        *   Structured Namespace. This document makes use of an LDAP 
            namespace which is built upon the existing DNS delegation 
            hierarchy, and which is supplemented by a layered namespace 
            consisting of service-specific containers and resource-
            specific entries. This namespace and the associated naming 
            rules facilitate the programmatic formation of queries, 
            structured data, and referrals. 
      
        *   Schema Definitions. This document reuses many existing LDAP 
            schema definitions, but also introduces several new object 
            classes, attributes, syntaxes and matching filters. Some of 
            these definitions apply to the overall architecture, while 
            others are concerned with specific resource types. 
      
        *   Searching Rules. This document defines several rules for 
            forming queries which are designed to facilitate consistent 
            answer sets, and to improve interoperability between 
            compliant clients and servers. 
      
        *   Query Processing Models. This document defines three 
            distinct query-processing models which may be used for 
            locating the authoritative servers associated with a named 
            resource. These include a "top-down" model which is 
            designed for querying centrally-managed Internet resources, 
            a "bottom-up" model which is designed for querying user-
            managed resources, and a "targeted search" model which is 
            designed for querying known servers for information about 
            known resources. This document also specifies protocol 
            behavior for following subordinate reference referrals, 
            continuation reference referrals, and attribute references. 
      
     As stated above, this document defines core schema and matching 
     rules, while external (related) documents define schema and 
     matching rules for specific resource types. Among the resource 
     types already defined (and partially reused herein) are:

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
      
        *   [ldap-whois-ipv4] - <draft-ietf-crisp-lw-ipv4-00.txt> - 
            Defining and Locating IPv4 Address Blocks using the 
            Internet Resource Query Service 
      
        *   [ldap-whois-ipv6] - <draft-ietf-crisp-lw-ipv6-00.txt> - 
            Defining and Locating IPv6 Address Blocks using the 
            Internet Resource Query Service 
      
        *   [ldap-whois-asn] - <draft-ietf-crisp-lw-asn-00.txt> - 
            Defining and Locating Autonomous System Numbers using the 
            Internet Resource Query Service 
      
        *   [ldap-whois-user] - <draft-ietf-crisp-lw-user-00.txt> - 
            Defining and Locating Contact Persons using the Internet 
            Resource Query Service 
      
     It is the intention of the author that additional resource types 
     will be added to this framework over time. 
      
      
  4.      The LDAP-WHOIS Namespace 
      
     A critical aspect of this service is the use of a predictable 
     naming syntax, both for the automatic creation of programmatic 
     searches for data, and for publishing structured data and 
     referrals. In order to ensure this predictability, this document 
     defines a multi-layered syntax which MUST be used by all compliant 
     implementations. 
      
     The LDAP-WHOIS service also makes provisions for the use of 
     multiple referral services for the purpose of redirecting LDAP 
     clients to foreign directory information trees (DITs). This allows 
     organizations to redirect queries to external service providers, 
     consolidate DITs within a single server, maintain foreign objects 
     within a private DIT (such as allowing a third-party router to 
     exist as a separately managed resource within an end-user DIT), 
     and allows answer sets to contain responses from multiple servers. 
      
      
  4.1.    Namespace Example 
      
     Figure 1 below shows a subset example of the LDAP-WHOIS namespace. 
     This namespace will be used throughout this document to illustrate 
     many of the concepts from this specification.

     Figure 1: Namespace for Example Widgets' domain and network. 
      
     Figure 1 shows different DITs, both of which are managed by the 
     Example Widgets company. The "dc=example,dc=com" DIT is 
     authoritative for the DNS domain of "example.com", while the 
     "dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" DIT is authoritative for the 
     reverse-lookup DNS domain of 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa and the IPv4 
     network of "192.0.2.0/24". 
      
     Both DITs have container entries called "cn=inetResources". This 
     container entry is responsible for holding all of the entries 
     which are associated with the Internet resources that are being 
     managed by the LDAP-WHOIS service. For example, the 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" entry contains a subordinate

     managed through the LDAP-WHOIS service, and also contains entries

     for the 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa reverse-lookup DNS domain and the 
     192.0.2.0/24 IPv4 network. 
      
     The "cn=inetResources,dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" entry 
     only exists as a referral which will cause queries to be 
     redirected to the "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" hierarchy. 
      
     The naming syntax and rules are described throughout the remainder 
     of this section 4.1. Figure 1 is only provided as an example a 
     relatively complete namespace, for illustration and subsequent 
     discussion purposes. 
      
      
  4.2.    The domainComponent LDAP Hierarchy 
      
     The top-level of the namespace defined for use with this service 
     uses the domainComponent naming syntax specified in RFC 2247, 
     which maps DNS domain names to domainComponent ("dc=") labels to 
     form a DIT. Each DIT represents a primary identifier for the 
     management body that is offering an LDAP server, and as such, 
     provides a primary identifier for the Internet resources under the 
     control of that organization. The DITs will be used to build LDAP 
     queries for specific resources, and will also be used to locate 
     the LDAP servers associated with the controlling organization. 
      
     Examples of the RFC 2247 syntax are shown in Figure 2 below. 
      
     Figure 2: The LDAP-WHOIS domainComponent Namespace. 
      
                                    dc=. 
                                      | 
                     +----------------+---------------+ 
                    /                 |                \ 
               dc=arpa              dc=com          dc=[...] 
                   |                  | 
                +--+--+           dc=example 
               /       \ 
         dc=in-addr   dc=ip6 
      
     A complete sequence of domainComponent DNs represents the scope of 
     the DIT. For example, a DIT with the distinguished name (DN) of 
     "dc=com" is authoritative for all of the LDAP resources within the 
     "com" DNS domain (for many LDAP-WHOIS queries, this will also 
     include any sub-domains under the "com" domain). Meanwhile, a DIT 
     with the DN of "dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" DIT is 
     authoritative for domain name resources within the reverse-lookup 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 10] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     "2.0.192.in-addr.arpa" DNS domain, as well as the IPv4 network 
     addresses within the 192.0.2.0/24 network. At the other extreme, 
     the dc="." DIT is responsible for all Internet resources (although 
     this DIT is rarely used). 
      
     Since the DIT determines the scope of control over a set of 
     resources, DITs that overlap also have overlapping scopes of 
     control. For example, the "dc=com" and "dc=example,dc=com" DITs 
     can both provide information about the "www.example.com" domain 
     name resource. In order to allow end-users to specify which scope 
     they wish to work with for any given query, this document defines 
     three different query models (these are described in section 7). 
      
     When the LDAP servers associated with the chosen DIT need to be 
     located, the domainComponent DNs from the DIT are mapped to a DNS 
     domain name, and a query is issued for the LDAP servers associated 
     with that domain name (this process is also described in section 
     7). This means that the authority to process LDAP searches for a 
     DIT comes directly from the portion of the DNS namespace already 
     under the control of that management body. For example, the LDAP 
     servers which are used to process queries for the "dc=com" DIT 
     will be located by querying the DNS zone responsible for the "com" 
     portion of the DNS namespace, and so forth. 
      
      
  4.3.    The inetResources Container 
      
     This specification requires the use of a mandatory LDAP container 
     entry with the well-known relative distinguished name (RDN) of 
     "cn=inetResources", which MUST exist in the root of every DIT that 
     provides LDAP-WHOIS services. All resource-specific entries which 
     are provided on public LDAP-WHOIS servers MUST be stored in the 
     cn=inetResources container entry. 
      
     The primary motivation for this naming is for predictability, in 
     that it allows searches to be formed programmatically (a search 
     base for resources in the "dc=example,dc=com" DIT can be 
     programmatically formed as "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com", 
     for example). However, there are several other motivating factors 
     for this naming syntax. 
      
     For example, it is easier to apply a single anonymous read-only 
     permission to the inetResources container than it is to apply the 
     same permission to multiple discrete entries, which in turn means 
     that it is more likely that the appropriate restrictions will be 
     defined. Furthermore, the use of a single container entry for all 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 11] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     of an organization's Internet resources allows that branch of the 
     DIT to be redirected to another DIT through the use of a single 
     referral operation (this will be particularly important when the 
     LDAP servers that are located by DNS lookups are not the same 
     servers that provide LDAP-WHOIS services). Another reason to use 
     this naming syntax is that it shelters clients from server-side 
     vagaries with DIT entries (where different vendors use different 
     object classes to define the DITs). 
      
     All told, the use of the "cn=inetResources" RDN facilitates smooth 
     operations, and is important enough to justify the MANDATORY usage 
     of this naming syntax. 
      
      
  4.4.    Resource-Specific Entries 
      
     This document defines four Internet resource types, each of which 
     have their own naming rules. However, each resource type has a 
     consistent naming principle, in that the specific managed resource 
     has an RDN which uniquely identifies that resource, with the RDN 
     residing within the inetResources container entry. 
      
     For example, an entry for the "www.example.com" domain name 
     resource stored in the "dc=example,dc=com" DIT would have a DN of 
     "cn=www.example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com", while an 
     entry for the "192.0.2.0/24" IPv4 network resource would have a DN 
     of "cn=192.0.2.0/24,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com". Although 
     the relative naming syntax is different for each resource type, 
     the resource naming is consistent for each type, and the position 
     of the RDN within the DN is also predictable. 
      
     Most resource types cannot be located through simple LDAP browsing 
     and equality matches. Instead, resource-specific entries use 
     structured naming rules in order to facilitate the extensible 
     match search operations which are specific to each of the defined 
     resource types. For example, there is not likely to be a specific 
     entry for every possible IPv4 address. In order to allow the 
     appropriate entry to be located, however, the client can use the 
     inetIpv4NetworkMatch extensible matching search operation, which 
     locates the appropriate entry based on the search input. 
      
     The naming rules associated with each resource type are provided 
     in section 5, along with the schema definitions for each of the 
     resource types. The extensible matching filters associated with 
     each resource type are described in section 6.

  4.5.    Redirects and Referrals 
      
     A critical objective behind this service is for servers to be able 
     to redirect clients to other servers, entries, or DITs, when this 
     is necessary or desirable. Towards this end, this document 
     specifies three methods for generating and processing redirects 
     and referrals: subordinate reference referrals, continuation 
     reference referrals, and attribute references. 
      
     Subordinate reference referrals indicate that the queried entry is 
     an alias for some other entry, and that the query has to be 
     restarted in order for the current operation to be completed. 
     Meanwhile, continuation references indicate that the search was 
     successfully initiated, but that additional queries are required 
     for the original query to be completely exhausted. Finally, 
     attribute references simply indicate that supplemental data is 
     available at some other location, but that no additional queries 
     are required to satisfy the current operation. 
      
            NOTE: RFC 2251 defines a superior reference referral which 
            is used as a "default referral" for out-of-scope searches. 
            However, this application specifically excludes support for 
            superior reference referrals. Any superior reference 
            referrals which are encountered as a part of this service 
            are to be treated as errors. 
      
     Subordinate references and continuation references use the ref 
     attribute and referral object class defined in [namedref]. 
     Attribute references use a superset of the formatting rules 
     associated with the labeledURI attribute, as defined in RFC 2079. 
     All of these mechanisms use LDAP URLs as their input data, 
     although these URLs have service-specific restrictions that are 
     somewhat tighter than the source specifications allow. 
      
     Among these rules: 
      
        *   All referenced entries MUST comply with the naming syntax 
            rules specified in this document. This means that all 
            entries MUST use the domainComponent ("dc=") naming syntax 
            for their DITs, resource-specific entries MUST reside in 
            the inetResources container entry, and resource-specific 
            entries MUST comply with the naming rules for the resource 
            type in question.

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
        *   Referral sources and targets MUST have the same resource-
            specific object classes defined (for example, the referral 
            source and target for a DNS domain resource would both have 
            the inetDnsDomain object class defined). This is a 
            prerequisite for the proper handling of the search filters 
            specified in this document. Attribute references are not 
            referrals, so they are exempt from this requirement. 
      
        *   Referenced entries MAY exist as referrals to other entries, 
            but recursive referrals are discouraged. 
      
        *   Except where otherwise noted, the protocol identifier of a 
            URL MUST specify the LDAP service type. Although general-
            purpose LDAP referrals are allowed to specify any URL, 
            LDAP-WHOIS referrals and references are intended to be used 
            for automated queries, so the use of other protocols or 
            services is expressly forbidden. 
      
        *   The host identifier of a URL MUST specify either an IP 
            address or a domain name. URLs which do not provide host 
            identifiers are invalid in all cases. 
      
        *   URLs MUST be provided and stored in a URL-safe format. For 
            example, the IPv4 and IPv6 network address syntaxes defined 
            in this document make use of the forward-slash ("/") 
            character to indicate a subnet prefix, and if this 
            character needs to be provided in a URL, it must be 
            provided in the escaped form ("%2F" in this example). 
            Furthermore, some of the matching rules described in this 
            document require that the URLs also be stored in this 
            format in order for the searches to succeed. 
      
        *   Implementations MUST NOT restrict URL values to verifiable 
            entries from local partitions. Implementations MAY validate 
            targets when the partition is known and accessible, but a 
            lack of knowledge regarding a target MUST NOT be cause to 
            prevent the entry from being specified. 
      
     Clients MAY implement support for additional protocol identifiers 
     if they wish to act upon URLs which are provided in conflict with 
     the requirements above. However, clients MUST NOT violate any 
     other mandates in this document while doing so (in particular, 
     clients MUST NOT break the query-processing procedures defined in 
     section 7 of this document).

     Each of the supported redirection mechanisms are discussed in more 
     detail below. 
      
      
  4.5.1.  Subordinate reference referrals 
      
     Subordinate reference referrals are returned when the search base 
     specified in a query names an entry which exists as a referral 
     object class that points to some other entry. 
      
     Any of the named entries specified in section 4 of this document 
     MAY be defined as subordinate reference referrals which point to 
     other entries. However, almost all of the search functions defined 
     for use by this service use the inetResources container entry as 
     the search base (the exceptions to this rule are targeted searches 
     for explicit entries), so subordinate reference referrals will 
     most commonly be seen when an inetResources container entry has 
     been redirected to an inetResources container in another DIT. 
      
     For example, the namespace shown in Figure 1 has an entry of 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" defined 
     with the referral object class, with the ref attribute value 
     pointing to the LDAP server of "ldap.example.com" and the DN of 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com". Any queries for resources 
     within "cn=inetResources,dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" 
     would be answered with that subordinate reference referral, and 
     these queries would have to be restarted using the specified 
     search base and server before they would be processed. 
      
     Servers MUST support the use of subordinate reference referrals 
     for this purpose, and clients MUST be prepared to accept and 
     process any subordinate reference referrals in answer sets. 
      
     When subordinate reference referrals are used for this purpose, 
     the referral source MUST be defined with the referral object 
     class, and MUST also be defined with the appropriate object class 
     for that resource type. For example, a "cn=inetResources" entry 
     which provided a subordinate reference referral would need to have 
     both the referral and inetResources object classes defined, while 
     a DNS domain resource such as "dc=example.com" would need to have 
     both the referral and inetDnsDomain object classes defined (among 
     the other object class definitions which were required for that 
     entry). Referral targets need to use whatever object classes are 
     appropriate for the resource in question, and MAY also be 
     referrals to other entries.

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     Client rules for processing subordinate reference referrals are 
     given in section 7.4.1. 
      
      
  4.5.2.  Continuation reference referrals 
      
     Continuation reference referrals are returned when a search 
     operation has been successfully processed by the queried server, 
     but the answer data also includes referrals to other entries. 
     These referrals are often provided as supplemental data to an 
     answer set, although this is not required (a continuation 
     reference referral can be the only response, but it won't be the 
     only response in the common case). 
      
     For example, the namespace shown in Figure 1 has an entry of 
     "cn=cref1,cn=2.0.192.in-addr.arpa,cn=inetResources,dc=example, 
     dc=com" defined with the referral object class, with the ref 
     attribute value pointing to the LDAP server of "ldap.example.com" 
     and the DN of "cn=example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com". 
     Any answers to any queries about "cn=2.0.192.in-addr.arpa" would 
     also include the continuation reference referral, and new queries 
     for the referral target would have to be issued before the 
     original queries were completely processed. 
      
     Servers MUST support the use of continuation reference referrals 
     for this purpose, and clients MUST be prepared to accept and 
     process any subordinate reference referrals in answer sets. 
      
     When continuation reference referrals are used for this purpose, 
     entries MAY exist for the queried resource, but one or more 
     entries MUST exist with the referral object class defined, and 
     which provide LDAP URLs that point to other entries which have 
     additional information about the resource in question. 
      
     Continuation reference referrals are returned in response to 
     specific extensible match queries, and have specific naming 
     requirements which are necessary for the matching functions to 
     work properly. These considerations are described in 7.4.3. 
      
     Client rules for processing continuation reference referrals are 
     also given in section 7.4.3.

  4.5.3.  Attribute references 
      
     This document defines attribute references as attribute values 
     which provide LDAP URLs, for the purpose of providing pointers to 
     contextually-related information regarding the entry currently 
     being viewed. Attribute references use the same basic syntax as 
     the labeledURI attribute defined in RFC 2079, although there are 
     additional restrictions, as described above. 
      
     The contact attributes defined in this document use the attribute 
     reference rules and formats to provide role-specific pointers to 
     inetOrgPerson entries. Whenever one of these attributes is 
     encountered, it is up to the client to deconstruct the provided 
     URLs in order to locate and read the inetOrgPerson entries, 
     although such actions are secondary to the original query process, 
     and will typically only be performed at the user's request. 
      
     For example, the namespace shown in Figure 1 has an entry of 
     "cn=192.0.2.0/24,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" defined with 
     the inetIpv4Network object class, with the inetIpv4Contacts 
     attribute value pointing to the LDAP server of "ldap.example.com" 
     and the DN of "cn=hostmaster,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com". When 
     this attribute is provided as part of an answer to a query, a 
     client MAY choose to follow this URL for information about that 
     contact, although this would be considered a new and separate 
     query, and would not be required to satisfy the original query. 
      
     Note that the attribute reference URLs are similar to the URLs 
     defined in RFC 2079, and use a two-part notation of 
     "url://any.host:port/any/path  description", with the 
     "description" string providing a free-text description of the 
     target specified by the URL. When the descriptive text is provided 
     in an attribute reference, it SHOULD be displayed to the user as 
     potentially informative data. 
      
     Client rules for processing attribute references are given in 
     section 7.4.4. 
      
      
  4.5.4.  labeledURI references 
      
     Some of the object classes defined in this document make use of 
     the labeledURI attribute, as defined by RFC 2079. These attributes 
     (and their values) are not governed by this document, but instead 
     are governed by RFC 2079. As such, the rules set forth in RFC 2079 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 17] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     always apply to those attributes. In particular, this means that 
     those attribute values may reference any protocol (such as 
     http://) and are not restricted to LDAP protocol targets. 
      
      
  5.      The LDAP-WHOIS Object Classes and Attributes 
      
     This document defines a general framework for locating information 
     about public network resources in a distributed environment, and a 
     critical element of this definition are schema definitions for the 
     object classes and attributes that provide this information. 
      
     Towards that end, this document defines a schema for the global 
     inetResources object class which is inherited by all of the 
     resource-specific types, defines four resource-specific object 
     classes, and defines a generalized object class for cross-
     referencing resources. This document also takes advantage of some 
     pre-existing schema definitions (in particular, the inetOrgPerson 
     object class), where suitable schema were available. Each of the 
     schema definitions provided in this document include attribute 
     definitions, naming rules, and other definitions which are 
     designed to facilitate searching and browsing Internet resources. 
      
     The following resource definitions are provided in this section: 
      
        *   Organizational and summary data. The inetResources object 
            class defines a variety of general-purpose attributes for 
            describing an organization and its resources. For example, 
            there is a free-text attribute which may be used to provide 
            general comments about the organization or the resources 
            under its control, attributes for providing general-use 
            postal and email addresses, and so forth. The inetResources 
            object class also defines several attributes which may be 
            used to provide attribute references for a variety of

        *   Associated objects. Internet resources are typically 
            assigned by independent entities, although there is often 
            an extensive amount of cross-pollination. For example, AS 
            Numbers are typically associated with IPv4 and IPv6 address 
            blocks, with this association being considered as a 
            mandatory linkage. However, less-formal associations also 
            often exist, such as a private organization associating an 
            IP address block with a specific DNS domain, or where a 
            regional authority is responsible for all domain name and 
            IP address delegations. Due to this flexibility, the LDAP-

            WHOIS service provides an auxiliary object class for 
            associated objects which may be used with any of the 
            resource-specific object classes defined in this document. 
      
     Each of the attributes and object classes listed above represent 
     the Internet-wide network resources which MAY be offered by an 
     LDAP-WHOIS server. 
      
     It is expected that additional network resource definitions will 
     be provided by other documents. 
      
      
  5.1.    The inetResources Object Class 
      
     The inetResources object class is a structural object class which 
     defines the attributes associated with a "cn=inetResources" 
     container entry, and which provides general information about the 
     network resources associated with the current DIT. 
      
      
  5.1.1.  Naming syntax 
      
     This document requires the presence of an entry named 
     "cn=inetResources" in the root of every DIT which provides LDAP-
     WHOIS services. 
      
      
  5.1.2.  Schema definition 
      
     Every DIT which provides public LDAP-WHOIS data MUST have a 
     "cn=inetResources" entry in the root of the DIT. The inetResources 
     entry MUST exist with the top and inetResources object classes 
     defined. If the entry exists as a referral, the entry MUST also be 
     defined with the referral object class, in addition to the above 
     requirements. 
      
     The inetResources object class is a structural object class which 
     is subordinate to the top abstract class, and which MUST be 
     treated as a container class capable of holding additional 
     subordinate entries. The inetResources object class has one 
     mandatory attribute which is "cn" (the naming attribute), and also 
     has several optional attributes. Each of the other object classes 
     defined by this document are subordinate to the inetResources 
     object class and inherit the attributes defined for the 
     inetResources object class.

     The inetResources object class is intended to provide summary 
     information about a collection of resources under the control of a 
     single organization or management body. For example, the mail 
     attribute is intended to be used as a general-purpose email 
     address for the organization as a whole (such as 
     "info@example.com"), rather than being used as an email address 
     for a particular administrative role. Because this object class is 
     also inherited by the resource-specific object classes, these 
     attributes can be defined at each of the subordinate entries if a 
     global set of values is undesirable or unfeasible. 
      
     The inetResources object class provides several multi-valued 
     contact-related attributes for a variety of well-known 
     administrative roles. This model allows the inetResources entry 
     and each of the subordinate managed resources to share a common 
     set of administrative roles, or to have unique roles for each 
     resource, as seen fit by the managing entity. The contact 
     attribute values follow the same rules as the labeledURI attribute 
     defined in RFC 2079, with additional restrictions as described in 
     section 4.5 of this document. 
      
     The various ModifiedBy and ModifiedDate attributes SHOULD be 
     treated as operational attributes. Their values SHOULD be filled 
     in automatically by the database management application, and 
     SHOULD NOT be returned except when explicitly requested. 
      
     Since multiple directory trees can share a single inetResources 
     entry (through the use of subordinate reference referrals), it is 
     important for the associated data to be applicable for all of the 
     objects which refer to it. For example, it would be effective for 
     a small private company to use a shared set of inetResources 
     attributes for their DNS domain names and IP network blocks, but 
     it would probably be counter-productive for a global ISP to share 
     contact data across all of their hosted domains and routed 
     networks. If separate contacts are required for each resource, the 
     contact data should be specified within each entry, rather than 
     being linked to the inetResources entry. 
      
     The schema definition for the inetResources object class is as 
     follows:

  5.2.    The inetAssociatedResources Object Class 
      
     The inetAssociatedResources object class defines cross-reference 
     attributes which may be used with any of the object classes 
     defined in this document. For example, it allows inetDnsDomain 
     object class entries to be associated with IPv4 networks, or even 
     to other DNS domains, if that information is known (this 
     information may be useful if a single organization has multiple 
     DNS domains registered). Furthermore, it allows inetOrgPerson 
     object classes to be associated with managed resources such as IP 
     networks or DNS domains. In short, any resource can be associated 
     with any other resource through the use of this object class. 
      
     The inetAssociatedResources object class MUST NOT be associated 
     with an entry that only exists as a referral source. 
      
      
  5.2.1.  Naming syntax 
      
     The inetAssociatedResources object class is an auxiliary object 
     class, and not a structural object class. Entries which use this 
     object class definition are primarily defined under the rules 
     associated with the structural object class that defines the 
     Internet resource in question. As such, the naming rules 
     associated with the structural object class in use with that entry 
     take precedence. Therefore, the inetAssociatedResources object 
     class does not define a naming syntax. 
      
      
  5.2.2.  Schema definition 
      
     The inetAssociatedResources object class is an auxiliary object 
     class which is subordinate to the top object class. The 
     inetAssociatedResources object class has no mandatory attributes, 
     although it does have several optional attributes. 
      
     Although the inetAssociatedResources object class is subordinate 
     to the top object class, it is intended to only be associated with 
     the resource-specific structural object classes defined in this 
     document. For example, the inetAssociatedResources object class is 
     not likely to provide much value when it is associated with the 
     inetResources object class, since the inetResources object class 
     does not specifically define any resources (and since it does not 
     define resources, it cannot define any associated resources). On 
     the other hand, it is reasonable for the inetAssociatedResources 
     object class to be associated with an inetOrgPerson object class

     entry, particularly if the referenced person (or role) is 
     responsible for the management of multiple resources. 
      
     Each of the associated resource attributes provide multi-valued 
     data, using the syntax notations which are specific to the 
     resource in question. For example, the inetAssociatedDnsDomain 
     attribute provides associated DNS domain name resources using a 
     multi-valued array, with each DNS domain name using the 
     inetDnsDomainSyntax naming rules. 
      
     The various ModifiedBy and ModifiedDate attributes SHOULD be 
     treated as operational attributes. Their values SHOULD be filled 
     in automatically by the database management application, and 
     SHOULD NOT be returned except when explicitly requested.

     is as follows: 
      
          inetAssociatedResources

  5.2.3.  Example 
      
     An example of the inetAssociatedResources object class is shown in 
     Figure 4 below.

  5.3.    The referral Object Class 
      
     This document allows the use of the referral object class to 
     define subordinate reference referrals and continuation reference 
     referrals for inetResources container entries and all of the 
     resource-specific entries. 
      
     Referral entries MUST conform to the schema specification defined 
     in [namedref]. In particular, referral entries MUST NOT contain 
     any user-definable attributes other than the mandatory "cn" naming 
     attribute and the mandatory "ref" operational attribute. By 
     extension, referral entries MUST be leaf nodes, and MUST NOT have 
     any subordinate entries defined at the referral source. 
      
     Furthermore, in order to facilitate programmatic access to this 
     data, LDAP URLs provided in ref attributes MUST refer to entries 
     which use the same object classes as the source entry, MUST refer 
     to an entry in a DIT which uses the domainComponent object class 
     syntax ("dc="), and MUST specify the LDAP protocol-type.

  5.4.    Object Class and Attribute Permissions 
      
     The information presented through the LDAP-WHOIS service will be 
     used for many operational and problem-resolution purposes. In 
     order for this information to be suitable for this purpose, it 
     must be accurate. In order to ensure the veracity of the 
     information, a minimal set of operational guidelines are provided 
     in this section. For the most part, these rules are designed to 
     prevent unauthorized modifications to the data. 
      
     Note that these rules only apply to data which is willingly 
     provided; no data is required to be entered, but where the data is 
     provided, it MUST be accurate, and it MUST be secured against 
     unauthorized modifications. 
      
        *   The inetResources container entry and all of the resource-
            specific subordinate entries within every public DIT that 
            provides LDAP-WHOIS resources SHOULD have anonymous read-
            only access permissions, and SHOULD NOT have anonymous add, 
            delete or modify permissions. 
      
        *   With the exception of contact-related attributes from the 
            inetOrgPerson object class, each attribute MAY have 
            whatever restrictions are necessary in order to suit local 
            security policies, government regulations or personal 
            privacy concerns. When the inetOrgPerson object class is 
            used to provide contact details, the mail attribute MUST be 
            defined, SHOULD be valid, SHOULD have read-only anonymous 
            access, and SHOULD NOT have anonymous add, delete or modify 
            permissions. 
      
            By using the inetOrgPerson object class, it is expected 
            that existing contact-related entries can be reused. If 
            reusing these entries is undesirable or unfeasible, entries 
            with the necessary access SHOULD be made available. 
      
            Note that contact pointers are entirely optional and are 
            not required to exist. However, where they exist, they MUST 
            comply with the above requirements. 
      
        *   End-users and implementers SHOULD provide anonymous access 
            to the creatorsName, createTimestamp, modifiersName and 
            modifyTimestamp operational attributes associated with each 
            entry in the inetResources branch, since this information 
            is useful for determining the age of the information.

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
        *   Server administrators MAY define additional add, delete or 
            modify permissions for authenticated users, using any 
            LDAPv3 authentication mechanisms they wish. In particular, 
            delegation entities MAY provide for the remote management 
            of delegated resources (such as assigning modification 
            privileges to the managers of a particular delegated domain 
            or address block), although this is entirely optional, and 
            is within the sole discretion of the delegation body. 
      
     External applications SHOULD NOT make critical decisions based on 
     the information provided through this service without having 
     reason to trust the veracity of the information. Clients and users 
     SHOULD limit the use of unknown or untrusted information to 
     routine purposes. 
      
      
  6.      Search and Match Filters 
      
     LDAP search filters are fairly flexible, in that they allow for a 
     wide variety of configurable elements, such as the maximum number 
     of entries which are returned, the type of comparison operation 
     that needs to be performed, and other details. In order to promote 
     interoperability, default values are defined here for many of 
     these elements, although these defaults are only applicable when 
     they are used with the LDAP-WHOIS service. 
      
     In particular, this document defines several suggested and 
     mandatory search filter qualifiers, which are described in detail 
     in section 6.1. This document also defines extensibleMatch filter 
     definitions which MUST be implemented whenever the associated 
     resource types defined in this document are implemented by an 
     LDAP-WHOIS client or server. These filter definitions are provided 
     in section 6.2 below. 
      
      
  6.1.    Search Filter Expressions 
      
     Section 4.5.1 of RFC 2251 defines the LDAP search request 
     specification, although it does not provide guidelines or 
     recommended values for the filter settings. In an effort to 
     promote interoperability among LDAP-WHOIS clients and servers, 
     this document defines some recommended and mandatory values for 
     searches within the LDAP-WHOIS service. 
      
            NOTE: These rules ONLY apply to the LDAP-WHOIS search 
            operations in particular. Any queries for other resources 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 31] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
            (such as requests for inetOrgPerson contact entries) MUST 
            NOT impose these restrictions. Also note that other 
            documents which define additional resource types can also 
            define different restrictions, and those definitions will 
            take preference over these guidelines. 
      
     Generic LDAP clients may be used to browse and search for data, 
     and in those cases, these rules are not likely to be followed. As 
     such, servers MUST be prepared to enforce these rules 
     independently of the client settings. 
      
     The values of an LDAP search filter should be as follows: 
      
        *   Search base. The DIT to be used in a search will vary for 
            each query operation. The methodology for determining the 
            current search base for a query is defined by the query-
            processing protocols described in section 7, although LDAP-
            WHOIS searches are normally constrained to the 
            "cn=inetResources" container of a particular DIT. 
      
        *   Scope. In order to support continuation reference referrals 
            (which are defined as referral entries beneath a resource-
            specific entry), clients MUST use a sub-tree scope for 
            LDAP-WHOIS searches. Servers MUST NOT arbitrarily limit the 
            scope of search operations. 
      
        *   Dereference aliases. Although the LDAP-WHOIS service does 
            not make direct use of alias entries, they are not 
            prohibited. Clients SHOULD set the Dereference Aliases 
            option to "Always" for LDAP-WHOIS searches. Servers SHOULD 
            dereference any aliases which are encountered, where this 
            is feasible (in particular, where the alias refers to 
            another DIT on the same server). 
      
        *   Size limit. The size limit field specifies the maximum 
            number of entries that a server should return. For the 
            LDAP-WHOIS service, this setting SHOULD be set to a value 
            between 25 and 100. This range ensures that the client is 
            capable of receiving a sufficient number of entries and 
            continuation references in a single response, but also 
            works to prevent runaway queries that match everything 
            (such as searches for "com", which can match every 
            inetDnsDomain entry in the "cn=inetResources,dc=com" 
            container). Servers MAY truncate answer sets to 100 
            responses if the client specifies a larger value.

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
        *   Time limit. The time limit field specifies the maximum 
            number of seconds that a server should process the search. 
            For the LDAP-WHOIS service, this setting SHOULD be set to a 
            value between 10 and 60 seconds. This range ensures that 
            the server is able to process a sufficient number of 
            entries, but also works to prevent runaway queries that 
            match everything. Servers MAY stop processing queries after 
            60 seconds if the client specifies a larger value. 
      
        *   Types-only. The types-only setting is a Boolean flag which 
            controls whether or not attribute values are returned in 
            the answer sets. Since excessive queries are likely to be 
            more burdensome than larger answer sets, this setting 
            SHOULD be set to FALSE. Resource-constrained clients (such 
            as PDAs) MAY set this value to TRUE, but these clients MUST 
            be prepared to issue the necessary subsequent queries. 
      
        *   Filter. The search operation will depend on the type of 
            data being queried. For LDAP-WHOIS queries, the filter MUST 
            use the matching rules defined in section 6.2 for the 
            relevant resource type. Other resource-specific documents 
            may define their own handling rules. 
      
            Note that the extensible match filters defined in this 
            document MUST be supported by LDAP-WHOIS clients and 
            servers. LDAP-WHOIS servers MAY also support additional 
            sub-string filters, soundex filters, or any other filters 
            they wish (these may be required for generic LDAP clients), 
            although LDAP-WHOIS clients MUST NOT expect any additional 
            filters to be available. 
      
        *   Attribute list. Clients MAY restrict the list of attributes 
            which are returned in searches, but are discouraged from 
            doing so without cause. 
      
      
  6.2.    Matching Filter Definitions 
      
     Each of the object classes defined in this document have their own 
     search criteria which MUST be used whenever a collection of 
     resource pools need to be searched. In this model, resource types 
     are specified during the search operation, and most of the 
     resource types have extensibleMatch definition which are used 
     whenever the available resources need to be searched. 
      
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 33] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     For example, if a user wishes to find the inetIPv4network object 
     class entry associated with a specific IPv4 address, then the 
     inetIpv4NetworkMatch extensibleMatch filter MUST be specified by 
     the client, and MUST be used by the server when attempting to 
     locate the relevant inetIpv4Network entry. 
      
     The inetResources object class can be searched with simple 
     equalityMatch filters, and do not require dedicated 
     extensibleMatch filters, although they do have specific handling 
     rules. 
      
     In order to ensure that all of the relevant entries (including any 
     referrals) are found, the search filters for these resources MUST 
     specify two distinct elements: the object class of the resource 
     being queried, and the naming element of the resource specified as 
     a distinguished name attribute. 
      
     For example, using the notation format described in RFC 2254, the 
     search filter expression for the inetOrgPerson entry associated 
     with "cn=admins,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com" would be structured 
     as "(&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn:dn:=admins))", using 
     "ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com" as the search base. This would find 
     all entries with the object class of inetOrgPerson (including all 
     of the referral entries for inetOrgPerson entries) where the 
     distinguished name contained the "cn" attribute of "admins". 
      
     The input source and search base for these matches will vary 
     according to the query being processed, but whenever an 
     equalityMatch is called for during query processing, the above 
     methods MUST be used in order to ensure that all of the related 
     entries are located. 
      
     Response entries MAY be fully-developed entries, or MAY be 
     referrals generated from entries which have the referral object 
     class defined. Any attribute values which are received MUST be 
     displayed by the client. If a subordinate reference referral is 
     received, the client MUST restart the query, using the provided 
     data as the new search base. If any continuation reference 
     referrals are received, the client SHOULD start new queries for 
     each reference, and append the output of those queries to the 
     original query's output.

  7.      Query Processing Models 
      
     The LDAP-WHOIS service uses three different query-processing 
     models. These are the "top-down" model which initiates the query 
     process at the top-level of a DNS delegation hierarchy, a "bottom-
     up" model which directs queries to user-managed servers, and a 
     "targeted" search model which is functionally identical to 
     traditional LDAP searches. Furthermore, any of these mechanisms 
     may be redirected to other servers, either through simple DNS 
     query processing, or by way of LDAP redirections (including 
     subordinate reference referrals, continuation reference referrals, 
     attribute references, or labeledURI attributes). 
      
     Each of the three query models are appropriate to different usage 
     environments. For example, the top-down model is best suited for 
     searches about global resources which are centrally managed and 
     delegated (such as IP addresses and DNS domains), and where 
     delegation information is a critical element of the resource data. 
     Meanwhile, the bottom-up model is most appropriate for those 
     resources which are managed by the end-users directly, and which 
     are not managed from a centralized delegation authority (this 
     includes information such as private keys, mail servers, and other 
     leaf-node resources). Finally, the targeted model is best suited 
     for explicit queries where a particular resource is supposed to 
     exist with a known DN (such as with contact pointers). 
      
     LDAP-WHOIS clients and servers MUST implement all three models. 
     Clients MUST default to using the top-down model, but clients MUST 
     also provide a user-selectable option for the disposition of 
     individual queries. 
      
      
  7.1.    Top-Down Processing 
      
     The top-down model is primarily suited for locating Internet 
     resources which are centrally managed and delegated. The top-down 
     model is similar to other distributed WHOIS protocols in this 
     regard, with the principle difference being the use of LDAP for 
     standardized syntaxes, data and referrals, rather than using a 
     specialized protocol specifically for this application. 
      
     The top-down model uses an input string to construct an LDAP 
     assertion value and search base, with DNS queries being used to 
     locate the LDAP servers associated with the appropriate top-level 
     delegation entity. Once this process completes, an extensible

     match query is issued to the specified servers. The query may also 
     be redirected through the use of LDAP referrals, if additional 
     data is known to exist elsewhere. 
      
     For example, a top-down search for the domain name of 
     "www.example.com" would result in the client building an 
     inetDnsDomainMatch extensible match query with the search base of 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=com", and with the client issuing a DNS query 
     for the LDAP servers associated with "com" domain. If the queried 
     server had information about the "www.example.com" resource, it 
     would be returned as answer data. If the server knew of other 
     sources of information about the resource (such as the registrar 
     for the domain, or the entity operating the domain, or both), 
     continuation reference referrals could be returned. Any of the 
     subsequent queries could return additional answers and/or 
     referrals, according to the data they had. 
      
     IP address blocks and AS numbers are processed in a similar 
     fashion. If a client needed to locate information about the 
     "192.0.2.14/32" IPv4 address, it would begin the process by 
     building a reverse-lookup DNS domain name from the input string, 
     and then issuing a DNS query for the LDAP servers associated with 
     the "arpa" top-level domain. Once a server had been located, an 
     LDAP query with the assertion value of "192.0.2.14/32" would be 
     submitted with a search base of "cn=inetResources,dc=arpa". The 
     server would return data and/or referrals, with this process 
     repeating until the query string had been completely processed. 
      
     Note that entries for the inetResources and inetOrgPerson object 
     classes are not searchable with this model, since they do not have 
     centralized delegation authorities. One of the other search models 
     MUST be used for those resource types. 
      
      
  7.1.1.  Processing steps 
      
     The steps for processing top-down queries are described below: 
      
        a.  Determine the input type (DNS Domain, IPv4 Address, etc.) 
   
        b.  Determine the authoritative domain name for the query. 
   
            1.   Separate the input string into discrete elements where 
                 this is possible. For a DNS domain name of 
                 "www.example.com", this would be "www", "example" and 
                 "com". For the IPv4 network number of "192.0.2.14", 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 36] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
                 this would be "192", "0", "2" and "14". AS numbers 
                 only have a single value and require no separation. Do 
                 not discard the original query string. 
      
            2.   IP addresses and AS numbers require additional 
                 conversion. For IPv4 addresses, strip off the prefix 
                 and convert the input string into a reverse-lookup DNS 
                 domain name by reversing the order of the octets and 
                 appending "in-addr.arpa" to the right of the domain 
                 name. For IPv6 addresses, strip off the prefix and 
                 reverse the nibble order of the address (where each 
                 nibble is represented by a single hexadecimal 
                 character), and append "ip6.arpa". For AS numbers, 
                 append only the "arpa" domain name. 
      
        c.  Form the LDAP search base for the query. 
      
            1.   Convert the right-most element from the domain name 
                 formed in step 7.1.1.b above into a domainComponent DN 
                 (such as "dc=com" or "dc=arpa"). This represents the 
                 DIT for the current query. 
      
            2.   Append the "cn=inetResources" RDN to the front of the 
                 domainComponent syntax ("cn=inetResources,dc=com"). 
                 This will form the fully-qualified search base for the 
                 LDAP query. 
      
        d.  Locate the LDAP servers associated with the resource by 
            processing the domain name formed in step 7.1.1.b above 
            through the SRV query steps provided in section 7.4.5. 
      
        e.  If the SRV lookup succeeds: 
      
            1.   Choose the best LDAP server, using the weighting 
                 formula described in RFC 2782. 
      
            2.   Construct the LDAP search filter according to the 
                 rules specified in section 6.1, using the appropriate 
                 matching rule from section 6.2. 
      
            3.   Formulate the LDAP search using the search base and 
                 search filter constructed above. For example, if the 
                 input query string was for "www.example.com", then the 
                 client would begin the process by submitting an 
                 inetDnsDomainMatch extensibleMatch search with the 
                 assertion value of "www.example.com", and with a

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
                 search base of "dc=inetResources,dc=com". Similarly, 
                 if the input query string was "192.0.2.14", then the 
                 client would begin the process by submitting an 
                 inetIpv4NetworkMatch extensibleMatch search with the 
                 assertion value of "192.0.2.14/32", and with the 
                 search base of "cn=inetResources,dc=arpa". 
      
            4.   Submit the search operation to the chosen server and 
                 port number. If the operation fails, report the 
                 failure to the user and exit. Otherwise, display any 
                 answer data which is returned. 
      
            5.   If the answer data contains a subordinate reference 
                 referral or a continuation reference referral, new 
                 query processes MUST be spawned. 
      
                 For subordinate reference referrals, process the URLs 
                 according to the rules described in section 7.4.1 and 
                 restart the query process at step 7.1.1.e.2. For each 
                 continuation reference referral, display the answer 
                 data received so far, process the LDAP URLs according 
                 to the rules described in section 7.4.3 and start new 
                 query processes for each referral at step 7.1.1.e.2, 
                 appending the output from these searches to the 
                 current output. 
      
                 Any additional subordinate reference referrals or 
                 continuation reference referrals which are encountered 
                 from any subsequent searches will need to be processed 
                 in the same manner as specified above, until no 
                 additional referrals are received. 
      
        f.  If the SRV lookup fails (where failure is defined as any 
            DNS response message other than an answer), report the 
            failure to the user and exit the current search operation. 
      
      
  7.1.2.  Top-Down example 
      
     In the example below, the user has entered a search string of 
     "www.example.com" and has indicated that the query is for a DNS 
     domain name. 
      
        a.  The input string is broken into the discrete label 
            components ("www", "example" and "com"). 
      
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 38] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
        b.  The right-most label ("com") is used to form the DNS SRV 
            lookup ("_ldap._tcp.com"), in order to find the LDAP 
            servers authoritative for the delegation hierarchy. 
      
        c.  One of the LDAP servers is contacted, and an 
            inetDnsDomainMatch search filter is submitted with the 
            assertion value of "www.example.com" and a search base of 
            "cn=inetResources,dc=com". 
      
        d.  The server responds with a continuation reference referral 
            URL of "ldap://ldap.netsol.com/cn=example.com, 
            cn=inetResources,dc=netsol,dc=com", indicating that the 
            domain delegation is managed under the "dc=netsol,dc=com" 
            DIT, and is hosted at the "ldap.netsol.com" server. The 
            client uses this information to start a new query. No 
            additional data was provided for the client to display. 
      
        e.  An inetDnsDomainMatch extensibleMatch search is submitted 
            to "ldap.netsol.com", using the search base of 
            "cn=example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=netsol,dc=com". 
      
        f.  The queried server returns the information that it has. No 
            additional referrals are provided. The client displays the 
            data and exits the query. 
      
      
   7.2.  Bottom-Up Processing 
      
     The bottom-up model is best used when a leaf-node resource needs 
     to be queried, and where an LDAP-WHOIS server is expected to be 
     able to answer the query. In this case, navigating down through a 
     delegation hierarchy would be either fruitless or inefficient. For 
     example, information about a mail domain would be more efficient 
     in the bottom-up model, since there is no global delegation body 
     for Internet mail (the DNS domains are delegated, but the message 
     routing is specific to the operational entities responsible for 
     the domain name). The bottom-up model can also be used for DNS 
     domain names, IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses, although this 
     will generally prove to be less useful than top-down queries, 
     given the limited number of user-managed servers deployed. 
      
     The bottom-up model uses an input string to construct an LDAP 
     assertion value and search base, with DNS queries being used to 
     locate the LDAP servers which are associated with the management 
     entity that is directly responsible for the resource in question. 
     Once this process completes, an extensible match query is issued 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 39] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     to the specified servers. The query may also be redirected through 
     the use of LDAP referrals, if additional data is known to exist 
     elsewhere. 
      
     For example, a bottom-up search for the domain name of 
     "www.example.com" would result in the client building an 
     inetDnsDomainMatch extensible match query with the search base of 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=www,dc=example,dc=com", and with the client 
     issuing a DNS query for the LDAP servers associated with 
     "www.example.com" domain. If the DNS lookup failed, the client 
     would issue a subsequent query for the LDAP servers associated 
     with the "example.com" domain, and so forth, until a server had 
     been located. If the queried server had information about the 
     "www.example.com" resource, it would be returned as answer data. 
     If the server knew of other sources of information about the 
     resource (such as the registrar for the domain, or the entity 
     operating the domain, or both), continuation reference referrals 
     could be returned. Any of the subsequent queries could return 
     additional answers and/or referrals, according to the data they 
     had. 
      
     IP address blocks are processed in a similar fashion. If a client 
     needed to locate information about the "192.0.2.14" IPv4 address, 
     it would begin by issuing a DNS query for the LDAP servers 
     responsible for the "14.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa" domain name, with 
     the left-most labels being truncated as the search for an 
     authoritative server was broadened. Once a server had been 
     located, an inetIpv4NetworkMatch extensibleMatch search with the 
     assertion value of "192.0.2.14/32" would be submitted. If the 
     server knew of any information about that resource, it would 
     return data or a referral, with this process repeating until the 
     query string had been processed as completely as possible. 
      
     Note that entries for inetAsNumber and inetOrgPerson object 
     classes are not searchable with this model, since they are not 
     represented in the DNS delegation hierarchy. One of the other 
     search models MUST be used for those resource types. 
      
      
  7.2.1.  Processing steps 
      
     The steps for processing bottom-up queries are described below: 
      
        a.  Determine the input type (DNS Domain, IPv4 Address, etc.) 
      
        b.  Determine the authoritative DNS domain for the resource. 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 40] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
      
            1.   Separate the input string into discrete elements where 
                 this is possible. For a DNS domain name of 
                 "www.example.com", this would be "www", "example" and 
                 "com". For the IPv4 network number of "192.0.2.14", 
                 this would be "192", "0", "2" and "14". Do not discard 
                 the original query string. 
      
            2.   IP addresses require additional conversion. For IPv4 
                 addresses, strip off the prefix and convert the input 
                 string into a reverse-lookup DNS domain name by 
                 reversing the order of the octets and appending  
                 "in-addr.arpa" to the right of the resulting sequence. 
                 For IPv6 addresses, strip off the prefix and reverse 
                 the nibble order of the address (where each nibble is 
                 represented by a single hexadecimal character), and 
                 append "ip6.arpa" to the right of the resulting 
                 sequence. 
      
        c.  Form the LDAP search base for the query. 
      
            1.   Convert the domain name formed in step 7.2.1.b above 
                 into a domainComponent DN (such as 
                 "dc=www,dc=example,dc=com" or "dc=0,dc=2,dc=0,dc=192, 
                 dc=in-addr,dc=arpa"). This represents the DIT for the 
                 current query. 
      
            2.   Append the "cn=inetResources" RDN to the left of the 
                 domainComponent syntax (perhaps resulting in 
                 "cn=inetResources,dc=www,dc=example,dc=com"). This 
                 will become the search base for the LDAP query. 
      
        d.  Locate the LDAP servers associated with the resource by 
            processing the domain name formed in step 7.2.1.b above 
            through the SRV query steps provided in section 7.4.5. 
      
        e.  If the SRV lookup fails with an NXDOMAIN response code (as 
            described in RFC 2308), then the domain name used for the 
            SRV lookup does not exist, and a substitute LDAP server and 
            search base must be identified. This process involves 
            determining the parent zone for the domain name in 
            question, issuing an SRV lookup for that zone, and using 
            the domain name of the zone as the new LDAP search base, 
            with this process repeating until a search base can be 
            located, or until a critical failure forces an exit.

            1.   Remove the left-most label from the domain name formed 
                 in step 7.2.1.b. 
      
            2.   If this process has already resulted in a query domain 
                 name at a top-level domain such as "com" or "arpa", 
                 convert the query domain name to "." (to signify the 
                 root domain). 
      
            3.   If the queried domain name is already set to ".", the 
                 query can go no higher (this most likely indicates a 
                 malformed DNS configuration, a connectivity problem, 
                 or a typo in the query). Exit and report the failure 
                 to the user. 
      
            4.   Restart the process at step 7.1.1.c, using the domain 
                 name formed above. Repeat until a server is located or 
                 a critical failure forces an exit. 
      
                 For example, if the original input string of 
                 "www.example.com" resulted in a failed SRV lookup for 
                 "_ldap._tcp.www.example.com", then the first fallback 
                 SRV query would be for "_ldap._tcp.example.com", and 
                 the next fallback query would be for "_ldap._tcp.com", 
                 possibly being followed by "_ldap._tcp.", and possibly 
                 resulting in failure after that. 
      
        f.  If the SRV lookup succeeds: 
      
            1.   Choose the best LDAP server, using the weighting 
                 formula described in RFC 2782. 
      
            2.   Construct the LDAP search filter according to the 
                 rules specified in section 6.1, and choose the 
                 appropriate matching rule from section 6.2. 
      
            3.   Formulate the LDAP search using the search base and 
                 search filter constructed above. For example, if the 
                 input query string was for "www.example.com", then the 
                 client would begin the process by submitting an 
                 inetDnsDomainMatch extensibleMatch search with the 
                 assertion value of "www.example.com", with the search 
                 base of "cn=inetResources,dc=www,dc=example,dc=com". 
      
            4.   Submit the search operation to the chosen server and 
                 port number. If the operation fails, report the

                 failure to the user and exit. Otherwise, display any 
                 answer data which is returned. 
      
            5.   If the answer data contains a subordinate reference 
                 referral or a continuation reference referral, new 
                 query processes MUST be spawned. 
      
                 For subordinate reference referrals, process the URLs 
                 according to the rules described in section 7.4.1 and 
                 restart the query process at step 7.2.1.f.2. For each 
                 continuation reference referral, display the answer 
                 data received so far, process the LDAP URLs according 
                 to the rules described in section 7.4.3 and start new 
                 query processes for each referral at step 7.2.1.f.2, 
                 appending the output from these searches to the 
                 current output. 
      
                 Any additional subordinate reference referrals or 
                 continuation reference referrals which are encountered 
                 from any subsequent queries will need to be processed 
                 in the same manner as specified above, until no 
                 additional referrals are received. 
      
        g.  If a fatal DNS error condition occurs, report the error to 
            the user and stop processing the current query. A fatal DNS 
            error is any response message with an RCODE of FORMERR, 
            SERVFAIL, NOTIMPL, or REFUSED, or where a query results in 
            NODATA (implying that an "_ldap._tcp" domain name exists 
            but it doesn't have an SRV resource record associated with 
            it, which is most likely a configuration error). 
      
      
  7.2.2.  Bottom-Up example 
      
     In the example below, the user has entered a search string of 
     "www.example.com" and has indicated that the query is for a DNS 
     Domain Name. 
      
        a.  The query string is used to form the DNS SRV lookup 
            ("_ldap._tcp.www.example.com"), in order to find the LDAP 
            servers authoritative for that domain name. 
      
        b.  The SRV lookup fails with NXDOMAIN, indicating that the 
            queried domain name does not exist.

        c.  The client creates a new query for the parent domain 
            ("_ldap._tcp.example.com"), which succeeds. 
      
        d.  The client contacts one of the servers, and issues an 
            inetDnsDomainMatch extensibleMatch search with the 
            assertion value of "www.example.com", and with the search 
            base of "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com". 
      
        e.  The server returns a continuation reference referral of 
            "ldap://ldap.example.net/cn=server1.example.net, 
            cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=net", indicating that the 
            queried resource is a referral for a web hosting server at 
            Example Networks. The client uses this information to start 
            a new query. No additional data was provided for the client 
            to display. 
      
        f.  An inetDnsDomainMatch extensibleMatch search is submitted 
            to the "ldap.example.net" server, using the search base of 
            "cn=server1.example.net,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=net" 
      
        g.  The queried server returns the information that it has. No 
            additional referrals are provided. The client displays the 
            data and exits the query. 
      
      
  7.3.    Targeted Search Processing 
      
     The targeted search model is similar to the bottom-up query model 
     described in the preceding section, except that it does not 
     provide fallback processing of DNS domain names. In this regard, 
     the targeted search model is closely similar to the traditional 
     LDAP searching model, in that a client queries a specified LDAP 
     server for a specific entry, under the assumption that the 
     resource exists at that location. If the server or resource does 
     not exist, the entire query fails. 
      
     For this reason, the targeted search model is not suitable for 
     search operations against generic Internet resources, but instead 
     is mostly suitable for searches against known entries which are 
     presumed to exist at a known location. In terms of the LDAP-WHOIS 
     service in particular, this includes inetOrgPerson entries which 
     are provided in contact-related attributes. However, the targeted 
     search model can be used for any resource type, and it can be 
     useful for diagnosing problems with resource types. For this 
     reason, clients SHOULD support this model for use with all known 
     resource types.

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
      
     The targeted search takes an LDAP URL as the query input (along 
     with the resource-type identifier), and uses the URL to determine 
     the query server, the search base, and the assertion value. 
      
      
  7.3.1.  Processing steps 
      
     The steps for processing targeted search queries are described 
     below: 
      
        a.  Process the LDAP URLs according to the continuation 
            reference referral handling rules described in section 
            7.4.3. This process will determine the servers, search base 
            and assertion value of the query. 
      
        b.  If this process succeeds: 
      
            1.   Construct the LDAP search filter according to the 
                 rules specified in section 6.1, and choose the 
                 appropriate matching rule from section 6.2. 
      
            2.   Submit the search operation to the chosen server and 
                 port number. If the operation fails, report the 
                 failure to the user and exit. Otherwise, display any 
                 answer data which is returned. 
      
            3.   If the answer data contains a subordinate reference 
                 referral or a continuation reference referral, new 
                 query processes MUST be spawned. 
      
                 For subordinate reference referrals, process the URLs 
                 according to the rules described in section 7.4.1 and 
                 restart the query process at step 7.3.1.b. For each 
                 continuation reference referral, display the answer 
                 data received so far, process the LDAP URLs according 
                 to the rules described in section 7.4.3 and start new 
                 query processes for each referral at step 7.3.1.b. 
      
                 Any additional subordinate reference referrals or 
                 continuation reference referrals which are encountered 
                 from any subsequent queries will need to be processed 
                 in the same manner as specified above, until no 
                 additional referrals are received.

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
        c.  If this process fails, report the failure to the user and 
            exit the current search operation. 
      
      
  7.3.2.  Targeted search example 
      
     In the example below, the user has provided an LDAP URL of 
     "ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=admins,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com", 
     and has indicated that the query is for an inetOrgPerson entry. 
      
        a.  The query string is used to form a DNS lookup of the 
            specified server ("ldap.example.com"). 
      
        b.  The client contacts the servers, and issues a search for 
            "(&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn:dn:=admins))", with a 
            search base of "ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com". 
      
        c.  The queried server returns the information that it has. No 
            additional referrals are provided. The client displays the 
            data and exits the query. 
      
      
  7.4.    Supplemental Query Processing Mechanisms 
      
     During the course of normal query processing, an LDAP-WHOIS client 
     may need to use additional mechanisms to complete an operation, 
     such as processing a URL received from a redirect operation, or 
     issuing DNS SRV lookups against a provided domain name. 
      
      
  7.4.1.  URL processing 
      
     URL processing in this specification is a function of both content 
     and context. Different attributes and result codes provide 
     different types of URLs, and the disposition of these URLs will 
     depend on the query-resolution process currently being executed. 
      
     On the content front, this specification allows three different 
     forms of URLs to appear throughout this service: labeledURI 
     attribute values, attribute references, and referral messages. 
     Each of these usage scenarios have slightly different restrictions 
     and formats. 
      
        *   The labeledURI attribute is included with the inetResources 
            object class for the purpose of informing end-users of a 
            generic resource associated with an entry (such as an 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 46] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
            organization's home page). The labeledURI attribute is 
            defined in RFC 2079 for the purpose of storing generic URLs 
            as attribute values, and uses a two-part syntax of 
            "url://any.host:port/any/path  description", with the 
            "description" string providing a free-text description of 
            the target specified by the URL. 
      
        *   Attribute references also use the two-part format of the 
            labeledURI attribute, but with some additional restrictions 
            as described in section 4.5 of this document. 
      
        *   Subordinate and continuation reference referrals use URLs 
            for the purpose of providing referral targets. The URL 
            format specified in [namedref] is also an explicit subset 
            of the labeledURI format, but without the "description" 
            free-text block. When used with the LDAP-WHOIS service, 
            subordinate and continuation referrals are subject to some 
            additional rules as described in section 4.5 of this 
            document. 
      
     Non-compliance with the requirements provided in section 4.5 
     amounts to an error, and is sufficient cause for a client to stop 
     processing a query. 
      
      
  7.4.2.  Subordinate reference referrals 
      
     Subordinate reference referrals and their schema are defined in 
     [namedref]. Subordinate reference referrals use the 
     SearchResultDone response with a Referral result code, which is 
     defined and described in section 4.1.11 of RFC 2251. Subordinate 
     reference referrals use a subset of the labeledURI syntax as 
     defined in RFC 2079, and use the syntax definitions from RFC 2255 
     when LDAP URLs in particular are provided, although section 4.5 of 
     this document also defines additional restrictions on the 
     allowable URL syntax. 
      
     In the context of the LDAP-WHOIS service, subordinate reference 
     referrals are returned when the search base specified in a search 
     operation exists as a referral object class with the ref attribute 
     pointing to some other entry, resulting in queries with that 
     search base being answered with a SearchResultDone referral 
     response. This condition means that the current search operation 
     cannot proceed past this point, and the search MUST be restarted. 
     This will most often occur when the inetResources entry for a DIT 
     has been redirected to another DIT, but it can also happen after

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     continuation reference referrals have been followed or after 
     targeted searches have been issued, and where the queried entry 
     exists as a referral to some other entry. 
      
     The procedure for processing URLs returned in a subordinate 
     reference referral is as follows: 
      
        a.  RFC 2251 allows multiple URLs to be provided, although the 
            URLs are not provided with any "preference" or "weighting" 
            values. If a set of URLs are provided, only one of the URLs 
            need to be tried (implementations MAY perform additional 
            queries in an attempt to recover from temporary failures, 
            although this is not required). Select one of the URLs at 
            random ("round-robin"), and continue to the next step in 
            the process. 
      
        b.  Extract and discard any description text which may have 
            been provided with the URL. 
      
        c.  Validate the protocol label. This specification only 
            supports the use of the LDAP service type. URLs with other 
            protocol identifiers are to be treated as malformed. 
      
        d.  Extract the host identifier element and perform any DNS 
            lookups which may be required. URLs without host 
            identifiers are to be treated as malformed. 
      
        e.  Extract the port number provided with the URL, and set it 
            aside for use with the subsequent connection attempt. If no 
            port number has been provided in the URL, use the default 
            port numbers associated with the protocol, as discovered in 
            step 7.4.2.c. 
      
        f.  Extract the path element from the URL for use as the search 
            base of the subsequent search operation. URLs without path 
            elements are to be treated as malformed. 
      
        g.  Restart the current search operation, using the LDAP server 
            from step 7.4.2.d, the port number from step 7.4.2.e, and 
            the search base formed in step 7.4.2.f. 
      
      
  7.4.3.  Continuation reference referrals 
      
     Continuation reference referrals and their schema are defined in 
     [namedref]. Continuation reference referrals use the 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 48] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     SearchResultReference response, which is defined and described in 
     section 4.5.3 of RFC 2251. Continuation reference referrals use a 
     subset of the labeledURI syntax as defined in RFC 2079, and use 
     the syntax definitions from RFC 2255 when LDAP URLs in particular 
     are to be provided, although section 4.5 of this document also 
     defines additional restrictions on the allowable URL syntax. 
      
     For this service, continuation reference referrals are returned 
     when the search base specified in a search operation exists, but 
     one or more of the answer elements exist as referral object 
     classes, resulting in one or more SearchResultReference responses. 
     This condition means that the current search operation has 
     partially succeeded, but that additional searches SHOULD be 
     started in order for all of the answer data to be retrieved (in 
     many cases, no answer data will be provided, and in those 
     situations, new queries will be required for any data to be 
     retrieved). This will occur whenever the assertion value of a 
     search has matched a resource entry which is being managed by 
     another DIT, and can occur with any of the search operations 
     described in this document. 
      
     Multiple continuation reference referrals MAY be returned in 
     response to a search, and each of them MUST be processed in order 
     for all of the answer data to be retrieved. 
      
     The procedure for processing the URLs returned in a continuation 
     reference referral is as follows: 
      
        a.  RFC 2251 allows multiple URLs to be provided, although the 
            URLs are not provided with any "preference" or "weighting" 
            values. If a set of URLs are provided, only one of the URLs 
            need to be tried (implementations MAY perform additional 
            queries in an attempt to recover from temporary failures, 
            although this is not required). Select one of the URLs at 
            random ("round-robin"), and continue to the next step in 
            the process. 
      
        b.  Extract and discard any description text which may have 
            been provided with the URL. 
      
        c.  Validate the protocol label. This specification only 
            supports the use of the LDAP service types. URLs with other 
            protocol identifiers are to be treated as malformed.

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
        d.  Extract the host identifier element and perform any DNS 
            lookups which may be required. URLs without host 
            identifiers are to be treated as malformed. 
      
        e.  Extract the port number provided with the URL, and set it 
            aside for use with the subsequent connection attempt. If no 
            port number has been provided in the URL, use the default 
            port numbers associated with the protocol, as discovered in 
            step 7.4.3.c. 
      
        f.  Extract the path element from the URL for use as the search 
            base of the subsequent search operation. URLs without path 
            elements are to be treated as malformed. 
      
        g.  Extract the left-most RDN from the search base constructed 
            in step 7.4.3.e, and delete the naming attribute label. The 
            resulting string will be used as the assertion value for 
            the subsequent search operation. For example, if the path 
            element from a URL provided a distinguished name of 
            "cn=example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com", then 
            the "cn=example.com" RDN would be used to form an assertion 
            value of "example.com". 
      
        h.  Start a new search operation, using the LDAP server from 
            step 7.4.3.d, the port number from step 7.4.3.e, the search 
            base formed in step 7.4.3.f, and the assertion value formed 
            in step 7.4.3.g. 
      
      
  7.4.4.  Attribute references 
      
     Attribute references are defined in this document as attributes 
     which provide URLs as pointers to contextually related 
     information. These are not referrals, but instead are simple URLs 
     returned as attribute values. In particular, this document defines 
     multiple contact-related attributes which provide these URLs. 
     Other documents may also define attributes which reuse the URL 
     format defined here, or may define their own URL rules, as needed. 
      
     For this service, attribute reference URLs are returned when an 
     entry has an attribute defined which uses them. Attribute 
     references are not referrals, and do not require additional 
     processing. Clients MAY automatically start new search operations 
     when an attribute reference is encountered, or they MAY delay 
     processing until a user requests the action.

     reference is as follows: 
      
        a.  RFC 2251 allows multiple URLs to be provided, although the

            random ("round-robin"), and continue to the next step in 
            the process.

            been provided with the URL.

            identifiers are to be treated as malformed. 
      
        e.  Extract the port number provided with the URL, and set it 
            aside for use with the subsequent connection attempt. If no 
            port number has been provided in the URL, use the default 
            port numbers associated with the protocol, as discovered in 
            step 7.4.4.c. 
      
        f.  Extract the path element from the URL for use as the search 
            base of the subsequent search operation. URLs without path 
            elements are to be treated as malformed. 
      
        g.  Extract the left-most RDN from the search base constructed 
            in step 7.4.4.e, and delete the naming attribute label. The 
            resulting string will be used as the assertion value for 
            the subsequent search operation. For example, if the path 
            element from a URL provided a distinguished name of 
            "cn=example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com", then 
            the "cn=example.com" RDN would be used to form an assertion 
            value of "example.com". 
      
        h.  Determine the object class filter to be used with the 
            assertion value. This will depend on the attribute which 
            provided the attribute reference. The contact-related

            attributes defined in this document refer to inetOrgPerson 
            object class entries. 
      
        i.  Start a new search operation, using the LDAP server from 
            step 7.4.4.d, the port number from step 7.4.4.e, the search 
            base formed in step 7.4.4.f, the assertion value formed in 
            step 7.4.4.g, and the new object class filter formed in 
            step 7.4.4.h. 
      
      
  7.4.5.  SRV processing 
      
     The query models described in this document make use of DNS SRV 
     resource records whenever a new query process is started, as a way 
     to locate the LDAP servers associated with a DIT. 
      
     The procedure for constructing this SRV lookup is as follows: 
      
        a.  Construct an SRV-specific label pair for the service type. 
            For LDAP queries, this will be "_ldap._tcp". 
      
        b.  Append the SRV label pair to the left of the input domain 
            name. In the case of an LDAP query for "example.com", this 
            would result in an SRV-specific domain name of 
            "_ldap._tcp.example.com". 
      
        c.  Issue a DNS query for the SRV resource records associated 
            with the domain name formed in step 7.4.5.b. 
      
     Multiple SRV resource records may be returned in response to a 
     query. Each resource record identifies a different connection 
     target, including the domain name of a server, and a port number 
     for that server. The port number specified in a SRV resource 
     record MUST be used for any subsequent bind and search operations. 
      
     SRV resource records provide "priority" and "weight" values which 
     MUST be used to determine the preferred server. If a server is 
     unavailable or unreachable, a connection attempt must be made to 
     the next-best server in the answer set. 
      
     Refer to RFC 2782 for a detailed explanation of SRV resource 
     records and their handling.

  8.      Internationalization and Localization 
      
     The LDAP-WHOIS model uses the internationalization and 
     localization services provided by LDAPv3. In this regard, LDAP-
     WHOIS clients do not need to implement any special services in 
     order to process and display internationalized attribute data, 
     since the attribute types already provide direct support for 
     internationalized data. 
      
     LDAP-WHOIS clients may have some localization or language-specific 
     presentation issues with regards to attribute names, in that the 
     names of the attributes may need to be localized for specific 
     markets. However, these services are outside the scope of the 
     protocol operations. Any such requirements must be dealt with 
     according to the services available on the client platform. 
      
     In the case of legacy WHOIS servers which gateway requests between 
     TCP port 43 and the LDAP-WHOIS service, the input and output 
     language and/or locale codes MAY be specified by server-specific 
     options, although these mechanisms must be defined as part of the 
     WHOIS protocol for any widespread consistency to be possible, and 
     are therefore beyond the scope of this document. 
      
      
  9.      DIT Replication 
      
     All DITs which provide data for global Internet resources SHOULD 
     be replicated across two or more servers. Each of the 
     authoritative LDAP servers for the managed resource MUST be 
     specified with a unique DNS SRV resource record for the domain 
     name associated with the top-level resource assignment space. 
      
     For example, the top-level "com" delegation space SHOULD have two 
     or more SRV resource records associated with the "_ldap._tcp.com" 
     domain name, with each entry referring to separate LDAP servers, 
     and with each of those servers maintaining accurate copies of the 
     "dc=com" DIT (within reasonable timeliness). Similarly, the top-
     level " arpa" domain which is used by the IPv4 and IPv6 delegation 
     trees SHOULD provide two or more SRV resource records for the 
     "_ldap._tcp.arpa" domain name, as should the "in-addr.arpa" and 
     "ip6.arpa" domain hierarchies. 
      
     DITs which serve multiple organizations SHOULD also be replicated. 
     For example, an ISP which provides LDAP-WHOIS services for their 
     customers SHOULD also follow these same rules, since outages of 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 53] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     those servers will affect multiple parties. Leaf-node DITs 
     associated with an user-managed resource MAY be replicated, and 
     are encouraged to do so. 
      
     Similarly, any referrals which present URLs as answer data SHOULD 
     provide multiple URLs, each of which reference different hosts on 
     different networks. For leaf-node referrals, attribute references, 
     and labeledURI references, this behavior MAY be relaxed, although 
     it is still encouraged. 
      
     Note that the most effective replication strategy will be for 
     entities to replicate their DITs with the delegation parents, as 
     this will allow queries for those resources to be processed by the 
     parent servers (thereby eliminating the need for referral 
     queries). In many cases, this will not be feasible (the servers 
     for the "dc=com" DIT cannot be expected to host replicas of every 
     subordinate DIT), but it is encouraged where practical. 
      
      
  10.     Transition Issues 
      
     There are a handful of areas where the proposed service does not 
     fully match with all of the existing WHOIS service offerings. 
     These areas are discussed in more detail below. 
      
      
  10.1.   NIC Handles 
      
     NIC handles represent a historical method of WHOIS lookups, tying 
     unique identifiers to a specific record in a specific database. 
     Given that the model proposed in this document uses a distributed 
     lookup system rather than isolated databases, the NIC handle model 
     is no longer necessary. Furthermore, given the limited global 
     usability of NIC handles, they should be deprecated. 
      
     However, NIC handles are an important part of the legacy service, 
     and their continued usage is likely to be desired in at least some 
     instances. There are two possible workarounds for this problem: 
      
        * NIC handle output in legacy WHOIS systems SHOULD be replaced 
          with an LDAP URL for the contact entries. This option 
          facilitates faster coalescence around the LDAP-WHOIS system. 
      
        * Referral entries MAY be defined for each existing NIC handle 
          if the explicit NIC handle is still required for an 
          application or usage, and queries for NIC handles MAY be 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 54] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
          processed through these referral entries. For example, the 
          NIC handle of EH26 on Network Solutions' WHOIS server can be 
          represented as "cn=EH26,cn=inetResources,dc=netsol,dc=com", 
          with the inetOrgPerson and referral object classes defined, 
          and with the ref attribute value pointing to an entry named 
          "cn=Eric A. Hall,cn=inetResources,dc=ntrg,dc=com". 
      
     Of the two mechanisms described above, the former is preferred. 
      
      
  10.2.   Change-Logs 
      
     Several WHOIS services provide pseudo change-logs in their 
     response data, listing each unique modification event which has 
     occurred for a particular resource. For example, RIPE and some of 
     its member ccTLDs provide WHOIS output which includes a series of 
     "changed" fields that itemize every modification event ("updated", 
     "added", etc.), the modifier, and the modification date, which 
     cumulatively act as a change-log for the resource in question. 
      
     While this service is useful and informative to the delegating 
     bodies, this information is not as useful to external entities. 
     Furthermore, the principle use of this information is for the 
     purpose of internal audits, rather than external information. 
     Finally, a subset of this kind of information is already provided 
     in the *modified* operational attributes, which are always 
     available for public review. 
      
     Organizations are certainly free to maintain this information on 
     their internal systems (and are even encouraged to do so). 
     However, this information is not necessary for public view of the 
     data in the LDAP-WHOIS service. Where the auditing information 
     will be required, a format which is more suitable to legal review 
     will be required and more appropriate. 
      
     For these reasons, this service is not supported in the LDAP-WHOIS 
     service. However, if this information is absolutely required, 
     implementers MAY provide it as additional unstructured data via 
     the inetGeneralComments attribute (perhaps using an 
     "event:modifier:date" format).

  10.3.   Open Issues 
      
     The following issues require additional analysis: 
      
        *   inetIpv6Network and other entries will likely benefit from 
            certificate-related data, although the extent and nature of 
            this information (minimum requirements, preferred 
            attributes, pre-existing schema, etcetera) is currently 
            unknown. 
      
        *   The RIPE database v3 has several additional attributes: 
            domain:     [mandatory]  [single]     [primary/look-up key] 
            descr:      [mandatory]  [multiple]   [ ] 
            admin-c:    [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            tech-c:     [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            zone-c:     [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            nserver:    [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            sub-dom:    [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            dom-net:    [optional]   [multiple]   [ ] 
            remarks:    [optional]   [multiple]   [ ] 
            notify:     [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            mnt-by:     [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            mnt-lower:  [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key] 
            refer:      [optional]   [single]     [ ] 
            changed:    [mandatory]  [multiple]   [ ] 
            source:     [mandatory]  [single]     [ ]

  11.     Security Considerations 
      
     This document describes an application of the LDAPv3 protocol, and 
     as such it inherits the security considerations associated with 
     LDAPv3, as described in section 7 of RFC 2251. 
      
     By nature, LDAP is a read-write protocol, while the legacy WHOIS 
     service has always been a read-only service. As such, there are 
     significant risks associated with allowing unintended updates by 
     unauthorized third-parties. Moreover, allowing the LDAP-WHOIS 
     service to update the underlying delegation databases could result 
     in network resources being stolen from their lawful operators. For 
     example, if the LDAP front-end had update access to a domain 
     delegation database, a malicious third-party could theoretically 
     take ownership of that domain by exploiting an authentication 
     weakness, thereby causing ownership of the domain to be changed to 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 56] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     another party. For this reason, it is imperative that the LDAP-
     WHOIS service not be allowed to make critical modifications to 
     delegated resources without ensuring that all possible precautions 
     have been taken. 
      
     The query processing models described in this document make use of 
     DNS lookups in order to locate the LDAP servers associated with a 
     particular resource. DNS is susceptible to certain attacks and 
     forgeries which may be used to redirect clients to LDAP servers 
     which are not authoritative for the resource in question. 
      
     Some operators may choose to purposefully provide misleading or 
     erroneous information in an effort to avoid responsibility for bad 
     behavior. In addition, there are likely to be sporadic operator 
     errors which will result in confusing or erroneous answers. 
      
     This document provides multiple query models which will cause the 
     same query to be answered by different servers (one would be 
     processed by a delegation entity, while another would be processed 
     by an operational entity). As a result, each of the servers may 
     provide different information, depending upon the query type that 
     was originally selected. 
      
     For all of the reasons listed above, it is essential that 
     applications and end-users not make critical decisions based on 
     the information provided by the LDAP-WHOIS service without having 
     reason to believe the veracity of the information. Users should 
     limit unknown or untrusted information to routine purposes. 
      
     Finally, there are physical security issues associated with any 
     service which provides physical addressing and delivery 
     information. Although organizations are generally encouraged to 
     provide as much information as they feel comfortable with, no 
     information is required. 
      
      
  12.     IANA Considerations 
      
     This document defines an application of the LDAPv3 protocol rather 
     than a new Internet application protocol. As such, there are no 
     protocol-related IANA considerations. 
      
     However, this document does define several LDAP schema elements, 
     including object classes, attributes, syntaxes and extensibleMatch 
     filters, and these elements should be assigned OID values from the 
   
  Hall & Newton          I-D Expires: August 2002             [page 57] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00.txt         July 2002 
   
   
     IANA branch, rather than being assigned from a particular 
     enterprise branch. 
      
     Furthermore, this document defines delegation status codes for 
     four of the resource types described herein, and IANA is expected 
     to maintain the code-point mapping values associated with these 
     attribute values. Each resource type may develop its own peculiar 
     status codes, so each of the mapping tables will need to be 
     maintained independently. 
      
     Finally, this document also describes several instances where 
     public DNS and LDAP servers are queried. It is expected that IANA 
     will establish and maintain these LDAP servers (and the necessary 
     DNS SRV domain names and resource records) required for this 
     service to operate. This includes providing SRV resource records 
     in the generic TLDs and the root domain, and also includes 
     administering the referenced LDAP servers.

     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00: 
      
        *   As a result of the formation of the CRISP working group, 
            the original monolithic document has been broken into 
            multiple documents, with draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core 
            describing the core service, while related documents 
            describe the per-resource schema and access mechanisms. 
      
        *   References to the ldaps: URL scheme have been removed, 
            since there is no standards-track specification for the 
            ldaps: scheme. 
      
        *   An acknowledgements section was added.

        *   The Objectives section has been removed. [ir-dir-req] is 
            now being used as the guiding document for this service. 
      
        *   Several typographical errors have been fixed. 
      
        *   Some unnecessary text has been removed. 
      
        *   Figures changed to show complete sets of object classes, to 
            improve inheritance visibility. 
      
        *   Clarified the handling of reverse-lookup domains (zones 
            within the in-addr.arpa portion of the DNS hierarchy) in 
            the inetDnsDomain object class reference text. 
      
        *   Referrals now use regular LDAP URLs (multiple responses 
            with explicit hostnames and port numbers). Prior editions

            of this specification used LDAP SRV resource records for 
            all referrals. 
      
        *   The delegation status codes used by the 
            inetDnsDelegationStatus, inetIpv4DelegationStatus, 
            inetIpv6DelegationStatus and inetAsnDelegationStatus 
            attributes have been condensed to a more logical set. 
      
        *   Added an inetDnsAuthServers attribute for publishing the 
            authoritative DNS servers associated with a domain. NOTE 
            THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY ATTRIBUTE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE 
            REPLACED BY GENERALIZED RESOURCE-RECORD ENTRIES AND 
            ATTRIBUTES. 
      
        *   Added an inetGeneralDisclaimer attribute for publishing 
            generalized disclaimers. 
      
        *   Added the inetAssociatedResources auxiliary object class 
            for defining associated resources, and moved some of the IP 
            addressing and ASN attributes to the new object class. 
      
        *   Several attributes had their OIDs changed. NOTE THAT THIS 
            IS AN INTERNET DRAFT, AND THAT THE OIDS ARE SUBJECT TO 
            ADDITIONAL CHANGES AS THIS DOCUMENT IS EDITED.
