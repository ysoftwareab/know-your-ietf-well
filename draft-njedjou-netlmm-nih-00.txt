               This document discusses the architecture and protocol implications of 
               making network initiation support easier with NetLMM. The framework 
               is restricted to inter-technology mobility within a single NETLMM 
               domain. It is proposed to add a new NetLMM message from the LMA to 
               the MAG, which function is to trigger, upon various events, the

               1. Introduction  
                
               [GOMM] describes various problems encountered when using traditional 
               mobility management protocols as MIP to achieve host mobility between 
               subnets. The following requirements were listed in [GOMM], in search 
               for a solution to those issues; 
               .    The need to avoid additional signalling on the radio link 
               already suffering latency and throughput issues in some technologies, 
               especially cellular. 
               .    The need to lower software and protocol support on hosts, 
               already running several radio technologies. This is namely required 
               by device manufacturers that want to satisfy providers roadmaps. 
               .    The need to ease network side initiation of mobility for 
               various criteria. This is required by operators that have to manage 
               rare resources and want to provide the best experience to their users 
               by giving them the best available connection.

               Internet Draft    NETLMM Network Initiated Handovers      October 2006 
                
                
                
               A solution addressing these requirements will contribute to an easier 
               acceptance and break into the market of IP mobility solutions. This 
               will also provide the ability to give a better user experience of 
               mobility. 
                
               With the creation of the NetLMM Working Group, the IETF Internet Area 
               has recently sponsored the design of a new system to achieve host 
               mobility. It turns out that the design goals of the NetLMM solution 
               address only the two first of the three basic requirements that are 
               listed above. 
                
               The present document provides ways to address the "network side 
               initiation of mobility" requirement of [GOMM], not addressed by 
               [NetLMM]. Indeed by addressing this remaining requirement, the goals 
               of [GOMM] would be considered as reached, considering what is now 
               defined as local mobility in [NetLMM]. 
               Actually, as far as [NetLMM] defines a way to achieve layer 3 
               mobility, the initiation of the mobility is at first sight an 
               orthogonal problem with respect to NetLMM goal. Indeed, providing 
               mechanisms to initiate mobility not only complement the description 
               of the NetLMM solution, but also slightly affects it. 
                
               The basic principle of NetLMM is about detecting (at the IP layer) 
               that a host has moved into the realm of a new IP link, and initiating 
               the appropriate information exchange with other nodes of the network 
               involved in managing the mobility of the host. Such an information 
               exchange is aimed at updating the IP location of the host. The point 
               of NetLMM is that everything happens without any host involvement. 
               Even though NetLMM operates via an initiation of the mobility 
               management by the edge of the network (i.e. through MAG), NETLMM 
               gives no possibility to involve any node located in the rest of the 
               network. When considering a multi-technology terminal located in an 
               area covered by several access networks, network initiation of the 
               mobility may happen not only as the consequence of the host arriving 
               in a new IP realm. A mobile host should be able to check connectivity 
               with the new access router without being handed over, especially 
               because the host would already have an attachment on another 
               interface. It then becomes a policy matter to decide to handover the 
               IP flow on the new access router (new interface on MN). 
               Therefore it should be allowed that a central network entity having 
               the policies participates in initiating the NetLMM procedure. 
               Policies would include criteria as load balancing or the need to 
               always connect the host with the best possible access network (the 
               one access that has the best throughput, the best suited for the 
               operator, the less expensive for the user…). The LMA may have such a 
               good central position, in which case it would be an appropriate node 
               to initiate the mobility. Indeed, in an inter-access system 
               deployment scenario, MAGs would not be suited to apply the network 
               policy that has to be transverse to all access systems.

               Internet Draft    NETLMM Network Initiated Handovers      October 2006 
                
                
               This document is not aimed at bringing policies considerations in 
               NETLMM (which are out of scope). It only tries to discuss how NetLMM 
               can be made compatible with policy in the network.  
               The Media Independent Handover (MIH) framework of 802.21 has been 
               designed to facilitate inter-access mobility management with awarness 
               of policies. 
               Therefore, the MIH reference model can help in solving the identified 
               problem, i.e. how to initiate the mobility by the network and this 
               for other motivations than the host pre-attachment to a MAG. For this 
               purpose, the document first presents the underlying deployment 
               scenarios, then details and discusses the alternatives ways of 
               including MIH functions in the NetLMM architecture. 
                
               Considerations about the transport of MIH signalling between NetLMM 
               nodes or other such considerations are clearly considered out of the 
               intended scope of this document. The present proposal relies on two 
               existing building blocks, namely NetLMM and 802.21 reference model, 
               to work out a solution to the network initiation problem. For this 
               purpose, the document envisages the appropriate combination of these 
               blocks. 
                
                
               2. Terminology 
               This terminology is derived from [RFC3753] and [NetLMM]. 
                
               Access System 
                
               An IP network that includes one or more access points, access routers 
               and access control points. 
                
                
               Inter-access mobility function 
                
               This is a function which can be located inside a provider aggregation 
               network. It collects various information that help for target 
               decision (done by the PDP). 
                
                
               Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) 
                
               The local mobility anchor (LMA) is a router that maintains 
               reachability to a mobile node's address while the mobile node moves 
               around within the Netlmm infrastructure.  It is responsible for 
               maintaining forwarding information for the mobile nodes which 
               includes a set of mappings to associate mobile nodes by their 
               identifiers with their address information, associating the mobile 
               nodes with their serving MAGs and the relationship between the LMA 
               and the MAGs. There may be one or more LMAs in a Netlmm 
               infrastructure.

               A framework that enables seamless continuity while an MN switches 
               between heterogeneous link-layer technologies. The framework relies 
               on the identification of a mobility-management protocol stack within 
               the network elements that support handover as well as on a reference 
               model [802.21]. 
                
                
               MN Initiated Handover 
                
               The MN is the one that makes the initial decision to initiate the 
               execution of the handover. 
                
                
               Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) 
                
               The Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) is a router that a mobile node is 
               attached to as the first hop router in the Netlmm infrastructure. The 
               MAG is connected to the mobile node over some specific link 
               provided by a link layer technology while the Netlmm infrastructure 
               is agnostic about the latter. Each MAG has its own identifier used in 
               Netlmm protocol messaging between the MAG and the LMA. The important 
               interfaces between link layer specific functions and the Netlmm 
               function reside on the MAG.  There are multiple MAGs in a Netlmm 
               infrastructure. 
                
                
               Network Initiated Handover (NIH) 
                
               The network makes the initial decision to initiate the execution of 
               the handover. 
                
                
               Policy Decision Point (PDP) 
                
               A function that decide of the best access system as target for an MN, 
               based on several criteria and information. 
                
                
               3. Deployment scenarios and use cases 
                
               3.1. Targeted cooperation scenario of access systems 
                
               Wireless  broadband  operators  worldwide  have  hard-worked  the 
               deployment of WLAN infrastructures to serve the increasing demand for 
               high speed internet access in delimited areas as airports, hotels and 
               conference centers. 
               Today, the demand is wider, including not only internet access but 
               also services as voice over IP. Also, the wireless access needs to be 
               ubiquitous (stadiums, motorways, parks, and other metropolitan 
               areas)and mobile. Wimax has been designed to undertake this 
               challenge.

               The Wimax Network architecture specification, [Wimax], basically 
               recommends that the radio sub-system (defined at IEEE 802) and the 
               network sub-system be coupled in a very specific manner (Access 
               Service Network Gateway).  
                
               Therefore, integrating Wimax in an operator network would certainly 
               require plugging the Wimax system alongside the already deployed IP 
               access stratum used for WLAN architectures for example. At a minimum, 
               if the existing IP access was to be re-used, the routers would have 
               to be changed to be interoperable with the Wimax radio sub-system. 
               Still, it would be needed in some areas of the topology to deploy new 
               Wimax specific access routers. 
               Therefore the following deployment figure sounds reasonable as a 
               starting hypothesis.

               3.2. Inter access Mobility management architecture 
                
               Because the system wants to provide the users with the connection 
               that best suits their needs, and also because of other resource 
               management purposes such as load balancing, there are situations 
               where a host should be indicated which link or access system to 
               switch to. To this end, a multi access system provider may want to 
               deploy mobility functions inside their network. 
                
               The following figure depicts an architecture to manage mobility with 
               a model of cooperation as presented in the precedent paragraph.

               In such a cooperation architecture, the inter-access mobility 
               function manages the overall user mobility by performing the 
               following actions: 
               .    Monitoring terminals conditions 
               .    Monitoring the capacity of every access system. 
               .    Instructing the terminal to handover between the access 
               systems. This should triggers IP mobility procedures. 
                
               Note that this inter-access mobility function can be co-located to 
               the node acting as the IP Mobility anchor.

               3.3. Use cases 
                
               The following use-cases illustrate why network initiated access 
               mobility upon best connection or load balancing criteria makes sense 
               for an integrated access networks system.

               Internet Draft    NETLMM Network Initiated Handovers      October 2006 
                
                
                
               We consider here an access network provider operating both WLAN and 
               WiMAX access services in the same geographical area. Indeed, that 
               might be a possible deployment scenario in an airport. 
               .    When a node, attached to WLAN requests a VoIP session, the 
               inter-system mobility function (depicted above) may instruct the node 
               to handover to Wimax because not enough capacity is remaining on the 
               WLAN system. Based on the cooperation scenario of Figure 2, a layer 3 
               handover would also be required. This is where the IP mobility 
               protocols as Mobile IP or NetLMM come into play. However, because of 
               the requirements listed in the introduction, Mobile IP is not a good 
               candidate for this layer 3 movement  (see [GOMM] for details). 
               .    When the Wimax BS becomes overloaded, the inter-system mobility 
               function may wish to handover some nodes to the WLAN access in order 
               to keep the Wimax capacity for highly demanding QoS users. 
               It is to be made clear however that policies considerations are 
               beyond the scope of this document. 
               It is also to be noted that, in both use cases, the handover need is 
               not generated by the discovery of a new IP connectivity. Still, layer 
               3 movement would be required because of the previous motivations. 
                
                
               4. IEEE 802.21-MIH protocol for Inter-access mobility 
                
               It is commonly accepted that the handover initiation and the handover 
               decision policy (i.e., access selection) are out-of-the-scope of 
               mobility management protocols such as MIP or NetLMM (these protocols 
               are only concerned with packet delivery on new path and/or possible 
               address update). 
                
               The IEEE 802.21 Working Group is currently proposing a specification 
               which facilitates, among other things, the handover initiation phase 
               across different (heterogeneous) access technologies. Accordingly, 
               802.21 implements a set of media independent events and commands 
               which allows both mobile-initiated and network-initiated handovers. 
               However, this draft only discusses the network-initiated case (just 
               as NetLMM). 
                
               The figure below shows how the 802.21 reference model can be used in 
               the inter-access system architecture of an integrated provider as 
               described in section 3.1.Here, the MIH Point of Service has a 
               transversal view on the access systems.

               802.21 would basically serve to prepare and execute the switch 
               between the involved access systems. When such a handover at layer 2 
               requires a handover at layer 3, protocols from the IETF would then 
               have to be invoked.

               The precedent figure simply pictures the different functions and 
               protocol messages that intervene in the process of managing the 
               inter-access mobility. The next section discusses how these functions 
               can be put together inside a provider architecture. 
                
                
               5. Implications of the 802.21 reference model in a NetLMM architecture 
                
               5.1. NetLMM solution status 
                
               NetLMM is a solution to avoid the host involvement in the IP level 
               mobility management. When the host does not participate into that 
               function, signalling on the wireless link is reduced, aside other 
               advantages. 
               The NetLMM designed team has issued a third draft in October. The 
               next section recalls its basic principles. It is reminded that the 
               solution described in [NetLMM] is the result of a work still in 
               progress, thus subject to modifications. 
                
               5.2. NetLMM in a nutshell 
                
               [NetlMM] describes a process by which a MN changes its attachment 
               from one Access Router (called Media Access Gateways - MAG) to 
               another while communicating and remaining reachable from anywhere in 
               the Internet. The MN pre-attaches to a new MAG via stateless or 
               stateful address configuration upon arrival in the MAG "domain". The 
               reception of a pre-attachment request (NDP/SLAAC, DHCP...) triggers a 
               location update process between the two MAGs (the new and the old 
               one) and a so-called Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) as shown on the 
               following picture. For the sake of simplicity, this figure only shows 
               the registration to the new MAG and not the deregistration from the 
               old MAG. 
               The LMA maintains connectivity of the MN with the rest of the 
               Internet. After the location update process is completed, the MN 
               gains IP connectivity with the new MAG by completing the network 
               attachment process (NDP/SLAAC, DHCP...). It is to be noted that the 
               MN keeps the same IP prefix (previously assigned by the LMA) when 
               switching from the old to the new MAG. For details see [NetLMM].

               5.3. NetLMM architecture with MIH functionalities support 
                
               This section depicts a possible introduction of the MIH reference 
               model inside a NetLMM architecture where access networks are 
               integrated and belong to the same NetLMM domain. As explained 
               earlier, such an integration aims at handling inter-access mobility 
               with control in the network. Because the MN is not involved in the IP 
               mobility management process, it is a requirement that the MN keeps 
               the same IP address while moving from one access system to the other. 
               In this architecture, it is suggested to co-locate the MIH service in 
               the network with the LMA function. 
               In an inter-access system deployment scenario with a MAG per system 
               as depicted below, it looks convenient to deploy the LMA in the 
               aggregated network. This is exactly where the MIH service was 
               introduced above (figure 3). 
               Overall, the model of the picture below aims at supporting 802.21 
               with minimal network impact. Such a requirement is essential for 
               providers and manufacturers.

               Some terminals may be configured to operate a single radio interface 
               at a time. In such a case, when the MN is instructed to handover, it 
               basically switches-off its current radio and powers on the target 
               one. The node would very probably then proceed to neighbour 
               discovery, which will automatically trigger NetLMM on the new MAG. 
               The MAG would in turn perform the location update as usual. Therefore 
               this scenario is naturally adapted to NetLMM. Indeed, when the MN 
               pre-attaches to the new MAG, it no more has any connectivity and is 
               bound to an IP layer handover.  
               However, it is to be noted that having a single interface active at a 
               time may induce more delay to the overall handover process. The 
               tendency is clearly toward an integration of radio technologies that 
               run in parallel. 
               The document is not really intended to address this scenario.

               5.3.2. Several active radio interface at the same time 
                
               In order to address the seamless continuity requirement, it may be 
               needed that the terminal has at least two interfaces that can be 
               active at the same time. Otherwise the seamlessness of the handover 
               would in many cases hardly be guaranteed. 
               Having an interface active supposes that the IP configuration on that 
               interface has completed successfully. When the involved access router 
               is a MAG, it can be assumed that the NetLMM procedure has taken 
               place. The problem arises when a second radio on a second interface 
               is powered up or attaches to a new Access Point. Upon such an event, 
               neighbour discovery may start on the interface. According to NetLMM, 
               the new MAG (assuming the APs on the two interfaces do not share the 
               same MAG-deployment scenario above) is expected to start the location 
               registration. 
               Effectively, in [NetLMM] the location update procedure automatically 
               starts after the MN_Access_Network API has performed. This gives no 
               possibility to launch the execution of that procedure for different 
               reasons and at a different time. Actually a PDP might want to control 
               the time at which the the NetLMM location update is started. The 
               reasons follow; 
               .    To provide the better connection available to the MN: the new 
               link may not necessarily bring more quality for the ongoing 
               communication of the MN in which case doing the NETLMM location upate 
               would damage the service. 
               .    To load-balance the MNs between the systems (whenever this has 
               the consequence of modifying the attachment of the MN from a MAG to 
               another) 
                
               The remainder of this document always assumes the second scenario 
               presented earlier is considered. 
                
               5.3.3. Resulting NetLMM protocol modification 
                
               The following message flow suggests an initiation of NetLMM that 
               would address the precedent problem, i.e. to better control the 
               location registration of NetLMM. 
                
               It is assumed that at the start of the procedure depicted below, the 
               MN has an already active interface. It is connected to its current 
               MAG. Also, the MN MIH status is assumed to be registered in the 
               network MIH service. The MIH status basically indicates the current 
               access system used by the MN. The MN is also considered to have 
               registered for link and MIH events. 
               A new NETLMM message is added. The following describes the protocol 
               operation including exchanges with the PDP. Clearly, description of 
               communication with the PDP is out-of-scope but useful as a matter of 
               illustration for a better understanding. 
                
               Interaction with the PDP (informative only)

               Internet Draft    NETLMM Network Initiated Handovers      October 2006 
                
                
               It is suggested that after the "MN_Access_Network API" primitive has 
               completed, the new MAG sends a request to the PDP to inform that the 
               MN has pre-attached. This request is called "MN attachment notify". 
               At this stage, the NETLMM process has to remain frozen until the PDP 
               deems necessary to decide that the MN should handover. When such a 
               decision is made, the network MIH (co-located here with the LMA) is 
               informed with a "Target Notify" message. It in turn requests the 
               terminal to switch its IP flows between links (MIH_Switch.request and 
               MIH_Switch.response ). 
               Actually, in a multi radio access environment the multi-interfaces MN 
               must be notified of the handover decision even if it keeps the same 
               IP address across IP realms. This allows the switch of flows from one 
               interface to the other. The "MIH_switch" command is one among other 
               means to reach this requirement. 
                
               NETLMM modification (normative) 
                
               Further, complementary to what is described in [NETLMM], at this 
               point (after the switch order), the LMA sends an "Update Start" 
               message to the new MAG. It is only when the new MAG receives the 
               "Update Start" message that it starts the location registration 
               update.  The  "Location  registration"  message  serves  as  an 
               acknowledgment to the "Update start". 
               In this way, the NETLMM process is made compatible with the network 
               policy.

               be started. Reception of this message by the MAG results in the

               LMA sends the Update Start message, it triggers a timer within which 
               it expects the MAG to send a Location Registration request. It is let

               6. The "No host support" problem 
                
               The whole point of NetLMM is to keep the layer 3 mobility procedure 
               transparent to the host. However, the MN would always have to switch 
               between links in order to maintain connectivity. These links could be 
               of different nature, in which case mechanisms as the MIH protocol are 
               needed to optimize the transition. Therefore, even if the MN appears 
               to be directly interacting with the LMA in the operation described 
               above, such an interaction is aimed at addressing the vertical 
               handover (inter-layer 2) and not the layer 3 mobility. Hence the "no 
               host involvement principle" of NetLMM is not violated with the 
               suggested amendment. 
                
                
               7. Security considerations 
                
               The mechanisms used for the transport of the MIH messages between the 
               Mn-MIH and the LMA-MIH are out of scope. So are the surrounding 
               security considerations. The NetLMM message added here has the same 
               security requirements as those of [NetLMM]. 
                
                
               8. Conclusion 
                
               This document is an effort to add the support of network initiation 
               of the handover to the NetLMM protocol. In a NetLMM normal operation, 
               the handover is already initiated by the network but the only 
               motivation to do so is that the MN has pre-attached to a new MAG. In 
               order to take into account other criteria for starting the location 
               update, the document suggests two things; 
               .    An adequate integration of the 802.21 MIH reference model in 
               the NetLMM architecture 
               .    A modification of the NetLMM protocol operation including the 
               state machine. 
               The resulting number of NetLMM messages can still be minimized. 
               However the author's primary intent not to modify the existing NetLMM 
               messages exchange, was put forward in resolving the problem.

               Appendix A. Distributed approach of the MIH support 
                
               Better scalability could be reached by distributing the MIH functions 
               over MNs, LMA and MAGs. Figure 8 depicts the mobility management 
               architecture with MIH functions distributed over NetLMM entities. The 
               mobility management process can be summarized as follows. 
                
               The MIH capable node attached to the access network A communicates 
               with the MIH service, collocated to the MAG A1. MAGs MIH functions 
               subscribe to MN events and monitor the points of attachment under its 
               control so as to be alerted about the need to trigger handover for 
               some MNs for different reasons. 
               The LMA MIH has a global view of the whole system and intervenes when 
               a MAG is not able to handle the needs of the MN. 
                
               If this approach is intended to bring scalability it would clearly 
               increase protocol complexity and impact of MIH support on NetLMM 
               infrastructure; especially because it requires MIH interface between 
               MAGs and additional MIH exchange between LMA and MAGs.
