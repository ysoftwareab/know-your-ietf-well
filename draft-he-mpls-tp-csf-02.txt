1. Introduction 

   In transport network OAM functionalities are important and 
   fundamental to ease operational complexity, enhance network 
   availability and meet service performance objectives by efficient and 
   automatic detection, handling, diagnosis and appropriate reporting of 
   defects and performance monitoring. 

   In the case of server layer defects detected in a transport network, 
   normally an AIS/FDI is generated for the downstream client signal as 
   an indication to the downstream network elements that the Client 
   signal is missing due to a server layer defect.  

   According to [MPLS-TP Framework], MPLS-TP clients include PW and 
   network layer clients. Examples of network layer clients include IP, 
   MPLS and MPLS-TP. 

   In cases the client service to be carried by MPLS-TP networks does 
   not provide mechanisms to propagate its failure information on top of 
   MPLS-TP networks (e.g. not needed in the original application of the 
   client signal, the signal was originally at the bottom of the layer

   stack and it was not expected to be transported over a server layer), 
   while such an indication is needed by the downstream, it is necessary 
   that MPLS-TP OAM provides such a tool to help propagate client 
   failure indication to the far end on detection of a failure of the 
   ingress client signal. 

   This document defines a MPLS-TP OAM tool as Client Signal Fail 
   indication (CSF) to propagate client failures and their clearance 
   across a MPLS-TP domain.

   Client Signal Fail indication (CSF) provides a function to enable a 
   MEP to propagate a client failure indication to its peer MEP across a

   MPLS-TP network in case the client service itself does not support 
   propagation of its failure status.  

   Packets with CSF information can be issued by a MEP, upon receiving 
   failure information from its client service. Detection rules for 
   client failure events are client-specific and are therefore outside 
   the scope of this document.

                         Figure 1 Use case of CSF 

   Figure 1 depicts a typical connection scenario between two client 
   network elements (Node A and Node D) interconnected through MPLS-TP 
   transport network. Client Node A connects to MPLS-TP Node B and 
   Client Node D connects to MPLS-TP Node C. Node B and C support MPLS-
   TP MEP function. 

   If a failure is detected between Node A and Node B and is taken as a 
   native client failure condition, the MEP function in Node B will 
   initiate CSF signal and it will be sent to Node C through MPLS-TP 
   network. CSF signal will be extracted at Node C as an indication of 
   client signal failure. Further, this may be mapped back into native 
   client failure indication and regenerated towards client Node D. 

   Node B learns the failure between A and B either by direct detection 
   of signal fail (e.g. loss of signal) or by some fault indications 
   between A and B (e.g. RDI, AIS/FDI).  

   If the connection between Node A and B recovers, Node B may stop 
   sending CSF signals to Node C (implicit failure clearance mechanism) 
   or explicitly send failure clearance indication (e.g. by flags in CSF 
   PDU format) to Node C to help expedite clearance of native client 
   failure conditions. 

   Accordingly, Node C will clear client failure condition when a valid 
   client data frame is received and no CSF is received (implicit 
   failure clearance mechanism) or upon receiving explicit failure 
   clearance indication.

3.2. Transmission of CSF 

   Upon learning signal failure condition of its client-layer the MEP 
   can immediately start transmitting periodic packets with CSF 
   information. A MEP continues to transmit periodic packets with CSF 
   information until the client-layer signal failure condition is 
   cleared. 

   The clearance of CSF condition can be communicated to the peer MEP 
   via: 

   - stopping transmission of CSF signal or 
   - forwarding CSF PDU with clearance indication. 
    
   Transmission of packets with CSF information can be enabled or 
   disabled on a MEP. 

   Detection and clearance rules for CSF events are client and 
   application specific and outside the scope of this draft. 

   The period of CSF generation is client and application specific. 

3.3. Reception of CSF  

   Upon receiving a packet with CSF information a MEP either declares or 
   clears a client-layer signal fail condition according to the received 
   CSF information and propagates this as a signal fail indication to 
   its client-layer.  

3.4. Configuration of CSF  

   Specific configuration information required by a MEP to support CSF 
   transmission is the following: 

   CSF transmission period - this is application dependent. 

   PHB - identifies the per-hop behavior of packet with CSF information. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with CSF information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support CSF functionality.

       - Period (Bits 53 to 55): CSF transmission period and can be 
       configured. 

5. Consequent actions 

   The original usage of CSF is to transport a client signal fail 
   condition at the input of the transport network to the output port of 
   the transport network for clients that do not have AIS defined. 

   CSF allows the transport network to create a condition at the output 
   port of the transport network such that the customer input port is 
   able to detect and alarm that there is no data arriving i.e. the 
   connection is interrupted. In this case, customers may choose another 
   transport network or another port to continue communication. 

6. Security Considerations 

    Malicious insertion of spurious CSF signals (e.g. DoS) is not quite 
    likely in a transport network since transport networks are usually 
    self-managed by operators and providers.
