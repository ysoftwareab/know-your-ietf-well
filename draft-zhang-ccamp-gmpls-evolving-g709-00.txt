Abstract 
 
   Recent revisions of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 have introduced new 
   features for Optical Transport Networks (OTN) ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, 
   ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex. Several recent documents have proposed 
   ways to modify GMPLS signaling protocols to support the new OTN 
   features. 

   It is important that a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS  
   signaling and routing protocols. This solution must address all of

   the new features, must be acceptable to all equipment vendors, and 
   must be extensible for the evolving OTN. 

   This document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) with new features including ODU0, 
   ODU4, ODU2e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends   
   MPLS to include Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex 
   (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and G.709),   Wavelength (Lambdas) Switching, 
   and Spatial Switching (e.g., incoming port or   fiber to outgoing 
   port or fiber). [RFC3471] presents a functional description of the 
   extensions to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling 
   required to support Generalized MPLS.  RSVP-TE-specific formats and 
   mechanisms and technology specific details are specified in [RFC3473]. 

   With the maturity and deployment of G.709 technology, it is necessary 
   that there should be a kind of control technology for G.709. [RFC4328]

   describes the control technology details that are specific to G.709 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) as specified in the ITU-T G.709 
   recommendation [ITUT-G709]. 

   However, with the evolution of OTN, there are some new features 
   introduced in ITU-T, for example, ODU0, ODU2e,ODU4 are described in 
   [G709-Amd3] and ODU3e1, ODU3e2 are described in [Gsup43] and ODUflex 
   is under being developed in [G709draft-v3]. 

   Therefore, it is obvious that [RFC4328] can not support these new 
   features of OTN from control plane perspective, and it should be 
   updated or replaced to support the evolving OTN. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible, efficient and understandable. 

2. Terminology 

 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. GMPLS Extensions for the Evolving G.709 - Overview 

   The new features for the evolving OTN are described in the separate 
   ITU-T documents, for example, ODU0, ODU2e,ODU4 are described in 
   [G709-Amd3] and ODU3e1, ODU3e2 are described in [Gsup43] and ODUflex 
   is under being developed in [G709draft-v3]. 

   The new signal types of digital wrapper layer for the evolving OTN 
   are listed as follows: 

      - Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk): 

       . OTU4 
       . OTU2e 
       . OTU3e1 
       . OTU3e2 
    
      - Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 

       . ODU0 
       . ODU2e

        . ODU3e1 
        . ODU3e2      
        . ODU4 
        . ODUflex 
    
   A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) is introduced 
   for ODU0, ODU4, ODU3e2 and ODUflex, so there are two TS granularities 
   for the original ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 because it should keep the 
   compatibility. 

   It also defines the new multiplexing hierarchy for the evolving OTN 
   except that the new signal types are introduced. In addition to the 
   support of ODUk mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 2e, 3, 3e1, 3e2, 4), 
   G.709 supports ODUk multiplexing. For the evolving OTN, the 
   multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k > j) 
   signal is as follows: 

   -  ODU0 into ODU1 multiplexing 

   -  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex into ODU2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS      
      granularity) 

   - ODU1 into ODU2 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

   - ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e and ODUflex into ODU3 multiplexing (with 
     1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

   - ODU1, ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

   - ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3 and ODUflex into ODU4 multiplexing 
     (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

   - ODU2e into ODU3e1 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

   - ODU2e into ODU3e2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

   [RFC4328] describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control 
   for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN) [ITUT-G709].However, 
   [RFC4328] can not support these new features of the evolving OTN from 
   control plane perspective, and it should be updated or replaced to 
   support the control for the evolving OTN. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible, efficient and understandable.

   Extensions for Traffic Parameters for the Evolving G.709 

   The traffic parameters for G.709 are defined in [RFC4328] as follows: 

    

       0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |  Signal Type  |   Reserved    |              NMC              | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |              NVC              |        Multiplier (MT)        | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                           Reserved                            | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   It is obvious that the Signal Type should be extended to cover the 
   new Signal Type introduced by the evolving OTN. The new Signal Type 
   is extended as follows: 

      Value  Type 
      -----  ---- 
      0      Not significant 
      1      ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps) 
      2      ODU2 (i.e., 10 Gbps) 
      3      ODU3 (i.e., 40 Gbps) 
      4      ODU4 (i.e., 100 Gbps) 
      5      Reserved (for future use) 
      6      OCh at 2.5 Gbps 
      7      OCh at 10 Gbps 
      8      OCh at 40 Gbps 
      9      OCh at 100 Gbps 
      10~19  Reserved (for future use) 
      20     ODU0 (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 
      21~30  Reserved (for future use) 
      31     ODU2e (i.e., 10Gbps for FC1200 and GE LAN) 
      32     ODU3e1  
      33     ODU3e2  
      34     ODUflex (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      35~255 Reserved (for future use)

4. Generalized Label 

   [RFC3471] has defined the Generalized Label which extends the 
   traditional label by allowing the representation of not only labels 
   which travel in-band with associated data packets, but also labels 
   which identify time-slots, wavelengths, or space division multiplexed 
   positions. The format of the corresponding RSVP-TE Generalized Label   
   object is defined in the Section 2.3 of [RFC3473]. 

   However, for different technologies, we usually need use specific 
   label rather than the Generalized Label. For example, the label 
   format described in [RFC4606] could be used for SDH/SONET, the label 
   format in [RFC4328] for G.709. 

   According to the ODUk label format defined in [RFC4328], it may have 
   some difficulties in extensibility. When ODU3 maps to ODU4, or 
   ODUflex maps to ODU4, lots of labels are requested, which brings 
   complicated signaling process. For example, when ODU3 is mapped into 
   ODU4 with 1.25G tributary slots, it will need thirty-two labels 
   (32*4*8=1024 bits) to be allocated for one ODU3 connection. If 
   ODUflex into ODU4, it may need eighty labels (80*4*8=2560 bits) to be 
   allocated for one ODUflex connection. 

   In this document, a new ODUk label format is defined. The new ODUk 
   label format is very flexible, efficient and understandable. 

4.1. New definition of ODUk label  

   In order to be compatible with new types of ODU signal and new types 
   of tributary slot, the following new ODUk label format is defined: 

     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | ODUj  |OD(T)Uk| T | Reserved  |           Bit Map             | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |                           .........                           | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 
   ODUj and OD(T)Uk (4 bits respectively): indicate that ODUj is 
   multiplexed into ODUk(k>j), or ODUj is mapped into OTUk (j=k). 

   ODUj field    Signal type 
   ----------    ----------- 
      0          ODU0

      7           OTU3e2 
      8-15        Reserved (for future use) 
    

   T (2 bits): indicates the type of tributary slot of OD(T)Uk. 
   Currently, two types of tributary slot are defined in [G.709], the 
   1.25Gbps tributary slot and the 2.5Gbps tributary slot. 

   T field      TS type 
   -------      -------        
     0          1.25Gbps TS granularity 
     1          2.5Gbps TS granularity 
     2-3        Reserved (for future use) 
    

   Bit Map (variable): indicates which tributary slots in ODUk that the 
   ODUj will be multiplexed into. The sequence of the Bit Map is 
   consistent with the sequence of the tributary slots in ODUk. Each bit 
   in the bit map represents the corresponding tributary slot in ODUk 
   with a value of 1 or 0 indicating whether the tributary slot will be 
   used by ODUj or not.  

   The size of the bit map equals to the total number of the tributary 
   slots of ODUk.

   Padded bits are added behind the Bit Map to make the whole label a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary. Padded bit MUST be set to 0 and 
   MUST be ignored. 

   In case of an ODUk mapped into OTUk, it's no need to indicate which 
   tributary slots will be used by ODUk, so the size of Bit Map is 0. 

4.2. Examples  

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the label 
   format described in the previous sections of this document. 

   1. ODUk in OTUk mapping: In such conditions, the downstream node 
      along an LSP returns a label indicating that the ODU1 (ODU2 or 
      ODU3 or ODU4) is directly mapped into the corresponding OTU1 (OTU2 
      or OTU3 or ODU4). The following example label indicates an ODU1 
      mapped into OTU1 with 2.5Gbps TS granularity. 

     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   2. ODUj into ODUk multiplexing: In such conditions, this label 
      indicates that an ODUj is multiplexed into several tributary slots 
      of OPUk and then mapped into OTUk. Some instances are shown as 
      follow: 

      - ODU0 into ODU2 Multiplexing: 
 
     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 
   This above label indicates an ODU0 multiplexed into the second 
   tributary slot of ODU2, wherein the type of the tributary slot is 
   1.25Gbps.

   This above label indicates an ODU1 multiplexed into the 2nd, 4th 
   tributary slot of ODU2, wherein the type of the tributary slot is 
   1.25Gbps. 

 
      - ODU2 into ODU3 Multiplexing with 2.5Gbps TS granularity: 

     0                   1                   2                   3

   This above label indicates an ODU2 multiplexed into the 2nd, 3rd, 5th 
   and 7th tributary slot of ODU3, wherein the type of the tributary 
   slot is 2.5Gbps. 

 
4.3. Label Distribution Procedure 

   This document does not change the existing label distribution 
   procedures [RFC4328] for GMPLS except that the new ODUk label should 
   be processed as follows. 

   When a node receives a generalized label request for setting up an 
   ODUj LSP from its upstream node, the node should generate an ODU 
   label according to the signal type of the requested LSP and the free 
   resources (i.e., free tributary slots of ODUk) that will be reserved 
   for the LSP, and send the label to its upstream node. Note that these 
   labels can also be specified by the source node of the connection.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then set the bits to 1 in 
   the Bit Map field corresponding to the reserved tributary slots.

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the node only needs to fill the ODUj 
   and the ODUk fields with corresponding values in the label. Other 
   bits are reserved and MUST be set to 0. 

   When receiving an ODU label from its downstream node, the node should 
   learn which ODU signal type is multiplexed or mapped into which ODU 
   signal type by analyzing the ODUj and the ODUk fields.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then obtain which tributary 
   slots in ODUk are reserved by its downstream node according to the 
   position of the bits that are set to 1 in the Bit Map field, so that 
   the node can multiplex the ODUj into the reserved tributary slots of 
   ODUk after the LSP is established. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the size of Bit Map field is 0 and 
   no additional procedure is needed.
