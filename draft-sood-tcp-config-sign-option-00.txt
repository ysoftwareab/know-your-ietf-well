Abstract 
    
   This RFC proposes a generic and configurable signature option for 
   TCP.  This work extends the practice defined in TCP MD5 Signature 
   Option for BGP sessions [RFC-2385].  This RFC describes a new TCP 
   Configurable Signature Option that allows any TCP-based application 
   to enhance security in TCP connections.  This option is configurable 
   because it allows implementers to choose the digest mechanism of 
   choice for each TCP connection.  This digest mechanism constructs a 
   signature for each TCP segment, using a (preferably) connection 
   specific shared secret key and components from TCP header and data.

1. Introduction 
    
   TCP is a transport protocol [RFC-0793], widely deployed and used in 
   current networks.  MD5 is a digest algorithm used in signature-based 
   message authentication mechanisms [RFC-1321].  Additional digest 
   algorithms have since been developed, and are good candidates for 
   complementing MD5. 
    
   The primary motivation for adding this option is to provide a 
   stronger mechanism into the TCP protocol, which allows for both ends 
   of a TCP connection to verify the identity of the peer.  RFC 2385 
   discusses a current practice used for securing BGP against spoofed 
   TCP segments, especially the TCP resets.  This current practice 
   requires an attacker to guess the sequence number and the password.  
   This password is used in computing the MD5 digest for each TCP 
   segment. 
    
   This proposal is an attempt to formalize this mechanism, and enable 
   it to be used by all TCP applications, if they choose to.  In 
   addition, various weaknesses in MD5 [Dobb-96] have been identified.  
   Therefore, the selection of MD5 as the digest algorithm is not only 
   limiting the applications, and is also less secure than, say SHA1 
   [FIPS-180-1] and HMAC [RFC-2104].

                  TCP Configurable Signature Option      January 2004 
 
 
   This document describes how to add an option to the TCP header, 
   called the Configurable Signature option, which allows a configurable 
   digest to be applied to TCP connections. 
    
   RFC-2385 prescribes the use of MD5 for BGP peers.  This document 
   maintains the same set of steps that are described in RFC-2385 for 
   the creation of the digest. 
 
2. TCP Configurable Signature Option Specification 
 
   Every TCP segment, which has to be protected against spoofing, will 
   contain a digest in this option.  This digest is created using the 
   digest mechanism defined in this document.  This option also defines 
   a field for the length of the digest (Bytes) included in this option.  
   The digest can be truncated for insertion into this TCP option. 
    
   Unlike other TCP options (like Window Scale Option) [RFC-1323], this 
   option is not negotiable between the peers.  The sender should be 
   independent of receiverÆs capability to verify and apply digest 
   signatures, when using this option.  In other words, this option 
   should be used by a sending application, as per the applications 
   requirement for being authenticated by the receiving peer. 
    
2.1 Processing 
    
   Every TCP segment sent on the TCP connection, which has to be 
   protected against spoofing, will contain the Configurable Signature 
   option, and the receiver must verify the signature.  This option 
   includes the computation of the digest value by the sender, using the 
   senderÆs shared key for that connection.  The steps required for 
   creation of this digest are described in Section 2.2. 
    
   The receiver of every TCP segment must re-compute the value of the 
   digest for every segment received.  Receiver follows the same steps 
   as the sender, and uses the receiverÆs shared key for this 
   connection, for digest computation.  The receiver then validates the 
   received digest value contained in the option, with the computed 
   digest value.   
    
   TCP segments are accepted for additional processing after the digest 
   values have been compared to be the same.  Any TCP connection 
   initiated with a signed SYN segment dictates that all following 
   segments in the connection (including SYN/ACK, Data), must also be 
   signed.  Receiver discards TCP segments for which the digests do not 
   match.  No further processing is done for those segments.  The 
   receiver also discards unsigned segments for this connection. 
    
2.2 Input Data Items for Digest Creation

                  TCP Configurable Signature Option      January 2004 
 
 
   The following items are applied to the selected digest algorithm, in 
   the order specified below.  Note that this is the same order 
   specified in RFC-2385, to minimize changes to current applications 
   that use RFC-2385 proposals. 
      1. TCP pseudo header in the order: 
           a. Source IP address 
           b. Destination IP address 
           c. Zero-padded protocol number 
           d. Segment Length 
      2. TCP header, excluding options, and assuming a checksum of 
         zero. 
      3. TCP segment data, if any 
      4. An independently specified key or password, known to both TCP 
         peers and presumably connection specific. 
    
   The TCP header and pseudo-header are in network byte order.  The 
   sending TCP host is in complete control of inserting this option, and 
   independent of the receiving host understanding this option.  A 
   mutual implementation of this option will be necessary for the 
   creation of TCP connections between the peers. 
    
2.3 Option Syntax 
    
   This option would appear in every segment of a connection, including 
   the SYN, ACK/SYN, and data segments.  The proposed option has the 
   following format: 
    
                +---------+---------+---------+---------+ 
                | Kind=21 |Length=20|Dig Type |Dig Len  | 
                +---------+---------+-------------------+ 
                | Digest...(possibly, truncated/padded) |           
                +---------------------------------------+ 
                |                                       | 
                +---------------------------------------+ 
                |                                       | 
                +-------------------+-------------------+ 
                |                   | 
                +-------------------+ 
    
   The fields are defined below: 
    
      Kind       1 Octet: The TCP option; value = 21 decimal 
      Length     1 Octet: Length of the option, as defined in RFC-0793; 
                  value = 20 decimal 
      Dig Type    1 Octet: Digest algorithm to be used.  Possible values 
                  are defined in section 2.4. 
      Dig Length  1 Octet: Length of the digest (in Bytes) included in 
                  this option.  This must be less than or equal to 16.

                  TCP Configurable Signature Option      January 2004 
 
 
      Digest     16 Octets: Computed digest, either complete, Padded or 
                  truncated, to fit the 16 octets defined in this 
                  option.  The digest field must be filled starting 
                  first bytes of the computed digest value.  Any pad 
                  bytes should be 0x00. 
                  Example: MD5 digest will be inserted completely, as 
                  it is 16 Bytes in length; HMAC-SHA1-96 will have 12 
                  Bytes of digest and rest padded with 0x00; SHA1 
                  digest, which is inherently 20 Bytes, will be 
                  truncated to first 16 Bytes. 
    
2.4 Digest Values 
    
   This section explains the digest values that can be used for filling 
   the Dig Type field in the option header. 
    
         Dig Type     Meaning 
         --------     ------- 
          0x01         SHA-1 
          0x02         MD-5 
          0x03         HMAC-SHA1 
          0x04         HMAC-MD5 
          0x05         HMAC-SHA1-96 [RFC-2404] 
          0x06         HMAC-MD5-96 [RFC-2403] 
          0x07         DES-MAC 
          0x08         AES-CCM [RFC-3610] 
 
   All other values are reserved. 
    
3. TCP Implications 
 
3.1 TCP Header Size 
    
   Inclusion of TCP options increases the header size, and the size of 
   this option must also be considered in the impacts on the TCP 
   headers.  The Configurable Signature Option defined in this document 
   specifies a total length of 20 Bytes. 
    
   Calculation of the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) should now 
   consider the additional 20 Bytes of header on every TCP segment.  The 
   MTU of the interface should now subtract an additional 20 Bytes for 
   effective MTU calculation. 
    
   Larger TCP headers lead to a lower effective throughput, which can 
   have differing impacts, based on the packet sizes of the application.  
   Applications must appropriately determine the impacts of these larger 
   header sizes on their traffic patterns.

                  TCP Configurable Signature Option      January 2004 
 
 
   The maximum size of this option has been limited to 20 Bytes to 
   accommodate all other options that have to be carried in a typical 
   SYN packet.  Based on TCP specifications [RFC-0793], the maximum size 
   of TCP header is 60 Bytes.  A breakup of the sizes used by various 
   options, above the standard 20 Bytes TCP header, is defined below, 
   and also discussed in RFC 2385: 
    
              . 4 Bytes of MSS option 
              . 4 Bytes window scale option 
              . 12 Bytes for time-stamp [RFC-1323] 
              . 20 Bytes for Configurable Signature Option 
    
   This sums to 40 Bytes.  Along with the standard 20 Byte TCP header, 
   the total reaches the maximum allowed TCP header size of 60 Bytes. 
    
   Please note that, as per RFC-0793, the end-of-option-list padding is 
   not necessary.  This is because the total length of all options has 
   reached the end of the TCP header. 
 
3.2 TCP Connectionless Resets 
    
   As discussed in RFC-2385, the receiver of the reset will ignore 
   connectionless resets, since the sender of the reset does not know 
   the shared secret key between communicating TCP peers.  The intruding 
   peer sending these connectionless resets will either generate 
   incorrect signatures using a bad key, or send the reset without this 
   TCP option.  In either case, the resets will be ignored. 
    
   Therefore, it becomes the responsibility of the TCP peer application 
   (say, BGP) to recover from crashes of itsÆ connection peer.  This 
   will also be true for cases when the usual TCP resets are not 
   generated in response to stale connections or for connection attempts 
   to a peer without a listener on that TCP port. 
    
4. Performance 
    
   Local computation of the digest and comparing it with the digest 
   value in the TCP option header will be a pre-requisite to any further 
   TCP processing.  These two additional steps will show their impact on 
   the normal processing rate of TCP implementations.  MD5 signature 
   generation is generally faster than the corresponding SHA1-1 
   signature generation.  The HMAC-based algorithms are slower, albeit 
   more secure, than their corresponding base algorithms. 
    
   A sample of performance numbers (Mbps) as seen on a 730 MHz Pentium-
   III processor with 256K Cache is as follows:

   On this platform, a delay of 2.56 usecs (.00256 msec) is noticed for 
   generation of signature for an ACK, using HMAC-MD5.  Generation of a 
   signature for a TCP segment with 1024 Bytes of data took 18.53 usecs 
   (0.01853 msecs), using HMAC-MD5.  Similar delays will be experienced 
   both at the receiver and at the sender.  The receiver will also bear 
   the additional cost of performing the compare operation. 
    
5. Security Considerations 
 
   This document defines a digest based security mechanism for TCP 
   peers, based on a pre-shared common secret between the peers.  The 
   proposal is designed to use one of the defined digest algorithms, and 
   as such, is as secure as the underlying security considerations of 
   those algorithms.   
    
   In addition, the shared secret value must be of sufficient length to 
   support each digest algorithmÆs strength.  Neither the length nor the 
   selection criteria of this shared secret should downgrade the 
   inherent strength of the algorithm in any manner.  The mechanism 
   through which the shared secret is communicated between the TCP 
   connection peers is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   This proposal also prescribes truncation of the calculated digest 
   value to accommodate in the available options field space.  Different 
   algorithms allow different characteristics when truncated.  
   Therefore, determination of the truncation impact on the algorithm 
   strength must be made prior to using that digest algorithm for 
   authentication.
