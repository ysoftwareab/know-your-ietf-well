                 Framework for Transport Network Slices
                    draft-nsdt-teas-ns-framework-00

Abstract

   This memo discusses setting up special-purpose transport connections
   using existing IETF technologies.  These connections are called
   transport slices for the purposes of this memo.  The memo discusses
   the general framework for this setup, the necessary system components
   and interfaces, and how abstract requests can be mapped to more
   specific technologies.  The memo also discusses related
   considerations with monitoring and security.

   This memo is intended for discussing interfaces and technologies.  It
   is not intended to be a new set of concrete interfaces or
   technologies.  Rather, it should be seen as an explanation of how
   some existing, concrete IETF VPN and traffic-engineering technologies
   can be used to create transport slices.  Note that there are is a
   rather large of these technologies, and new technologies or
   capabilities keep being added.  This memo is also not intended
   presume any particular technology choice.

1.  Introduction

   This draft provides a framework for discussing transport slices, as
   defined in [I-D.nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition] (to be replaced
   by draft-rokui-teas-transport-slice-definition).  It is the intention
   in this document to use terminology consistent with this and other
   definitions provided in that draft.

   In particular, this document uses the following terminology defined
   in the defintions document: - Transport Slice - Transport Slice

Internet-Draft      Transport Network Slice Framework         March 2020


   Controller (TSC) - Transport Network Controller (TNC) - Nothrbound
   Interface (NBI) - Southbound Interface (SBI)

   This framework is intended as a structure for discussing interfaces
   and technologies.  It is not intended to be a new set of concrete
   interfaces or technologies.  Rather, the idea is that existing or
   under-development IETF technologies (plural) can be used to realize
   the ideas expressed here.

   For example, virtual private networks (VPNs) have served the industry
   well as a means of providing different groups of users with logically
   isolated access to a common network.  The common or base network that
   is used to provide the VPNs is often referred to as an underlay
   network, and the VPN is often called an overlay network.  As an
   example technology, a VPN may in turn serve as an underlay network
   for transport slices.

   Note: It is conceivable that extensions to these IETF technologies
   are needed in order to fully support all the ideas that can be
   implemented with slices, but at least in the beginning there is no
   plan for the creation of new protocols or interfaces.

   Driven largely by needs surfacing from 5G, the concept of network
   slicing has gained traction ([NGMN-NS-Concept], [TS23501], [TS28530],
   and [BBF-SD406]).  In [TS23501], Network Slice is defined as "a
   logical network that provides specific network capabilities and
   network characteristics", and a Network Slice Instance is defined as
   "A set of Network Function instances and the required resources (e.g.
   compute, storage and networking resources) which form a deployed
   Network Slice".  According to [TS28530], an end-to-end network slice
   consists of three major types of network segments: Radio Access
   Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and Core Network (CN).
   Transport network provides the required connectivity between
   different entities in RAN and CN segments of an end-to-end network
   slice, with a specific performance commitment.  For each end-to-end
   network slice, the topology and performance requirement on transport
   network can be very different, which requires the transport network
   to have the capability of supporting multiple different transport
   slices.

   While network slices are commonly discussed in the context of 5G, it
   is important to note that transport slices are a narrower concept,
   and focus primarily on particular network connectivity aspects.
   Other systems, including 5G deployments, may use transport slices as
   a component to create entire systems and concatenated constructs that
   match their needs, including end-to-end connectivity.

Internet-Draft      Transport Network Slice Framework         March 2020


   A Transport Slice could span multiple technologies and multiple
   administrative domains.  Depending on the consumer's requirements, a
   transport slice could be isolated from other, often concurrent
   transport slices in terms of data, control and management planes.

   The consumer expresses requirements for a particular transport slice
   by specifying what is required rather than how the requirement is to
   be fulfilled.  That is, the Transport Slice consumer's view of a
   transport slice is an abstract one.

   Thus, there is a need to create logical network structures with
   required characteristics.  The consumer of such a logical network can
   require a degree of isolation and performance that previously might
   not have been satisfied by traditional overlay VPNs.  Additionally,
   the transport slice consumer might ask for some level of control of
   their virtual networks, e.g., to customize the service paths in a
   network slice.

   This document specifies a framework for the use of existing
   technologies as components to provide a transport slice service, and
   might also discuss (or reference) modified and potential new
   technologies, as they develop (such as candidate technologies
   described in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn]).

2.  Requirements

   It is intended that transport slices can be created to meet specific
   requirements, typically expressed as bandwidth, latency, latency
   variation, and other desired or required characteristics.  Creation
   is initiated by a management system or other application used to
   specify network-related conditions for particular traffic flows.

   And it is intended that, once created, these slices can be monitored,
   modified, deleted, and otherwise managed.

   It is also intended that applications and components will be able to
   use these transport slices to move packets between the specified end-
   points in accordance with specified characteristics.

   As an example of additional requirements that might apply to
   transport slices, see [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] (in particular,
   section 3).

3.  Framework

   A number of transport slice services will typically be provided over
   a shared underlying network infrastructure.  Each transport slice
   consists of both the overlay connectivity and a specific set of



Gray, Editor, et al.   Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Transport Network Slice Framework         March 2020


   dedicated network resources and/or functions allocated in a shared
   underlay network to satisfy the needs of the transport slice
   consumer.  In at least some examples of underlying network
   technologies, the integration between the overlay and various
   underlay resources is needed to ensure the guaranteed performance
   requested for different transport slices.

   ** Align with definitions draft **

   The users of transport slices are:

   o  The management system or other application that creates and
      manages them.

   o  The applications and components wishing to use these slices.

   Transport users are served by the system that can build transport
   slices, as follows:

   o  A controller takes requests from a management system or other
      application, which are then communicated via an abstracted
      northbound interface.  This interface transmits data objects that
      describe the needed transport slices in terms of topology and
      service level objectives (SLO).

   o  These requests are assumed to be translated by one or more
      underlying systems, which establish specific transport slice
      instances, using specific implementation techniques (such as IP
      and MPLS) implemented on top of the underlying network
      infrastructure.

   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] provides an example
   architecture that might apply in using the technology described in
   that document.

3.1.  Management systems or other applications

   The transport slice system is used by a management system or other
   application.  These systems and applications may also be a part of a
   higher level function in the system, e.g., putting together network
   functions, access equipment, application specific components, as well
   as the transport slices.

3.2.  Expressing connectivity intents

   The Transport Slice Controller (TSC) northbound interface (NBI) can
   be used to communicate between transport slice users (or consumers)
   and the TSC.



Gray, Editor, et al.   Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Transport Network Slice Framework         March 2020


   A transport slice user may be a network operator who, in turn,
   provides the transport slice to another transport slice user or
   consumer.

   Using the NBI, a consumer expresses requirements for a particular
   slice by specifying what is required rather than how that is to be
   achieved.  That is, the consumer's view of a slice is an abstract
   one.  Consumers normally have limited (or no) visibility into the
   provider network's actual topology and resource availability
   information.

   This should be true even if both the consumer and provider are
   associated with a single administrative domain, in order to reduce
   the potential for adverse interactions between transport slice
   consumers and other uses/users of the transport network
   infrastructure.

   The benefits of this model can include:

   o  Security: because the transport network (or network operator) does
      not need to expose network details (topology, capacity, etc.) to
      transport slice consumers the transport network components are
      less exposed to attack;

   o  Layered Implementation: the transport network comprises network
      elements that belong to a different layer network than consumer
      applications, and network information (advertisements, protocols,
      etc.) that a consumer cannot interpret or respond to (note - a
      consumer should not use network information not exposed via the
      TSC NBI, even if that information is available);

   o  Scalability: consumers do not need to know any information beyond
      that which is exposed via the NBI.

   The general issues of abstraction in a TE network is described more
   fully in [RFC7926].

   This framework document does not assume any particular layer at which
   transport slices operate as a number of layers (including virtual L2,
   Ethernet or IP connectivity) could be employed.

   Data models and interfaces are of course needed to set up transport
   slices, and specific interfaces may have capabilities that allow
   creation of specific layers.

   Layered virtual connections are comprehensively discussed in IETF
   documents and are widely supported.  See, for instance, GMPLS-based
   networks ([RFC5212] and [RFC4397]), or ACTN ([RFC8353] and

   [RFC8353]).  The principles and mechanisms associated with layered
   networking are applicable to transport slices.

   There are several IETF-defined mechanisms for expressing the need for
   a desired logical network.  The NBI carries data either in a
   protocol-defined format, or in a formalism associated with a modeling
   language.

   For instance:

   o  Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)
      [RFC5440] and GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) using RSVP-TE
      [RFC4208] use a TLV-based binary encoding to transmit data.

   o  Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
      Protocol [RFC8040] use XML abnd JSON encoding.

   o  gRPC/GNMI [I-D.openconfig-rtgwg-gnmi-spec] uses a binary encoded
      programmable interface;

   o  SNMP ([RFC3417], [RFC3412] and [RFC3414] uses binary encoding
      (ASN.1).

   o  For data modeling, YANG ([RFC6020] and [RFC7950]) may be used to
      model configuration and other data for NETCONF, RESTCONF, and GNMI
      - among others; ProtoBufs can be used to model gRPC and GNMI data;
      Structure of Management Information (SMI) [RFC2578] may be used to
      define Management Information Base (MIB) modules for SNMP, using
      an adapted subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1,
      1988).

   While several generic formats and data models for specific purposes
   exist, it is expected that transport slice management may require
   enhancement or augmentation of existing data models.

3.3.  Transport Slice Controller (TSC)

   The transport slice controller takes abstract requests for transport
   slices and implements them using a suitable underlying technology.  A
   transport slice controller is the key building block for control and
   management of the transport slice.  It provides the
   creation/modification/deletion, monitoring and optimization of
   transport Slices in a multi-domain, a multi-technology and multi-
   vendor environment.

   A TSC northbound interface (NBI) is needed for communicating details
   of a transport slice, as well as providing information to a slice

Internet-Draft      Transport Network Slice Framework         March 2020


   requester/consumer about transport slice status and performance.  The
   details for this NBI are not in scope for this document.

   The controller provides the following functions:

   o  Provides a technology-agnostic NBI for creation/modification/
      deletion of the transport slices.  The API exposed by this NBI
      communicates the endpoints of the transport slice, transport slice
      SLO parameters (and possibly monitoring thresholds), applicable
      input selection (filtering) and various policies, and provides a
      way to monitor the slice.

   o  Determines an abstract topology connecting the endpoints of the
      transport slice that meets criteria specified via the NBI.The TSC
      also retains information about the mapping of this abstract
      topology to underlying components of the transport slice as
      necessary to monitor transport slice status and performance.

   o  Provides "Mapping Functions" for the realization of transport
      slices.  In other words, it will use the mapping functions that:

      map technology-agnostic NBI request to technology-specific SBIs.

      map filtering/selection information as necessary to entities in
      the underlay network.

   o  Via an SBI, the controller collects Telemetry data (e.g.  OAM
      results, Statistics, States etc.) for all elements in the abstract
      topology used to realize the transport slice.

   o  Using the Telemetry data from the underlying realization of a
      transport slice (i.e. services/paths/tunnels), evaluates the
      current performance against transport slice SLO parameters and
      exposes them to the transport slice consumer via the NBI.  The TSC
      NBI may also include a capability to provide notification in case
      the transport slice performance reaches threshold values defined
      by the transport slice consumer.

3.3.1.  Northbound Inteface (NBI)

   The Transport Slice Controller provides a Northbound Interface (NBI)
   that allows consumers of network slices to request and monitor
   transport slices.  Consumers operate on abstract transport slices,
   with details related to their realization hidden.

   The NBI complements various IETF services, tunnels, path models by
   providing an abstract layer on top of these models.




Gray, Editor, et al.   Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Transport Network Slice Framework         March 2020


   The NBI is independent of type of network functions or services that
   need to be connected, i.e. it is independent of any specific storage,
   software, protocol, or platform used to realize physical or virtual
   network connectivity or functions in support of transport slices.

   The NBI uses protocol mechanisms and information passed over passed
   over those mechanisms to convey desired attributes for transport
   slices and their status.  The information is expected to be
   represented as a well-defined data model, and should include at least
   endpoint and connectivity information, SLO specification, and status
   information.

   To accomplish this, the NBI needs to convey information needed to
   support communication across the NBI, in terms of identifying the
   transport slices, as well providing the above model information.

3.4.  Mapping

   The main task of the transport slice controller is to map abstract
   transport slice requirements to concrete technologies and establish
   the required connectivity, and ensuring that required resources are
   allocated to the transport slice.

3.5.  Underlying technology

   There are a number of different technologies that can be used,
   including physical connections, MPLS, TSN, Flex-E, etc.

   See [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] - section 5 - for instance, for
   example underlying technologies.

   Also, as outlined in "applicability of ACTN to Transport Slices"
   below, ACTN ([RFC8453]) offers a framework that is used elsewhere in
   IETF specifications to create virtual network (VN) services similar
   to Transport Slices.

   A transport slice can be realized in a network, using specific
   underlying technology or technologies.  The creation of a new
   transport slice will be initiated with following three steps:

   o  Step 1: A higher level system requests connections with specific
      characteristics via NBI.

   o  Step 2: This request will be processed by a Transport Slice
      Controller which specifies a mapping between northbound request to
      any IETF Services, Tunnels, and paths models.

Internet-Draft      Transport Network Slice Framework         March 2020


   o  Step 3: A series of requests for creation of services, tunnels and
      paths will be sent to the network to realize the trasport slice.

   It is very clear that regardless of how transport slice is realized
   in the network (i.e. using tunnels of type RSVP or SR), the
   definition of transport slice does not change at all but rather its
   realization.

4.  Applicability of ACTN to Transport Slices

   [RFC8453] defined three controllers as per the framework for
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) to support virtual
   network (VN) services - Customer Network Controller (CNC), Multi-
   Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) and Provisioning Network Controller
   (PNC).  A CNC is responsible for communicating a customer's virtual
   network requirements, a MDSC is responsible for multi-domain
   coordination, virtualization/abstraction, customer mapping/
   translation and virtual service coordination to realize the virtual
   network requirement.  Its key role is to detach the network/service
   requirements from the underlying technology.  A PNC oversees the
   configuration, monitoring and collection of the network topology.
   The PNC is a underlay technology specific controller.

   While the ACTN framework is a generic VN framework that is used for
   various VN service beyond the transport slice, it is still a suitable
   based to understand how the various controllers interact to realize
   the Transport slice.

   A mapping between the Transport Slice definitions and ACTN
   definitions is as shown in Figure 1 below.

   The TSC NBI conveys the generic transport slice requirements.  These
   may then be realized using an SBI.

   As per [RFC8453] and [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-yang], the CNC-MDSC
   Interface (CMI) is used to convey the virtual network service
   requirements along with the service models and the MDSC-PNC Interface
   (MPI) is used to realize the service along network configuration
   models.  [I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang] further describe how
   the VPN services can be mapped to the underlying TE resources.

   The Transport Network Controller is depicted as a single block, where
   as in the ACTN framework this has been decomposed into MDSC and PNC
   to handle multiple domains and various underlay technologies.

   [RFC8453] also describes TE Network Slicing in the context of ACTN as
   a collection of resources that is used to establish a logically
   dedicated virtual network over one or more TE networks.  In case of

   TE enabled underlying network, ACTN VN can be used as a base to
   realize the transport network slicing by coordination among multiple
   peer domains as well as underlay technology domains.

5.  Considerations

5.1.  Monitoring

   Transport slice realization needs to be instrumented in order to
   track how it is working, and it might be necessary to modify the
   transport slice as requirements change.  Dynamic reconfiguration
   might be needed.

5.2.  Security Considerations

   Transport slices might use underlying virtualized networking.  All
   types of virtual networking require special consideration to be given
   to the separation of traffic between distinct virtual networks, as
   well as some degree of protection from effects of traffic use of
   underlying network (and other) resources from other virtual networks
   sharing those resources.

   For example, if a service requires a specific upper bound of latency,
   then that service can be degraded by added delay in transmission of
   service packets through the activities of another service or
   application using the same resources.

   Similarly, in a network with virtual functions, noticeably impeding
   access to a function used by another transport slice (for instance,
   compute resources) can be just as service degrading as delaying
   physical transmission of associated packet in the network.

   While a transport slice might include encryption and other security
   features as part of the service, consumers might be well advised to
   take responsibility for their own security needs, possibly by
   encrypting traffic before hand-off to a service provider.

5.3.  Privacy Considerations

   Privacy of transport nework slice service consumers must be
   preserved.  It should not be possible for one transport slice
   consumer to discover the presence of other consumers, nor should
   sites that are members of one transport slice be visible outside the
   context of that transport slice.

   In this sense, it is of paramount importance that the system use the
   privacy protection mechanism defined for the specific underlying
   technologies used, including in particular those mechanisms designed

   to preclude acquiring identifying information associated with any
   transport slice consumer.
