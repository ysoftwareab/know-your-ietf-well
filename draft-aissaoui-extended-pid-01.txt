  2    Introduction 
      
     There has been much discussion in the PWE3 and MPLS working group 
     mailing lists about the concept of MPLS or PW protocol identifier 
     (PID). A number of applications for the MPLS/PW PID have been 
     identified: 
      
     a. The first one has to do with the IP aliasing issue [1]. In 
        networks where load balancing schemes such as ECMP are used, 
        the first nibble immediately following the bottom of the label 
        stack may infer a IPv4 or IPv6 if its value is 4 or 6. Some 
        ECMP implementations include this nibble in the hashing 
        mechanism and may attempt to process further information beyond 
        this nibble if the packet is mistaken for an IP packet. It is 
        therefore required that non-IP payloads not to infer these two 
        values. In the specific case of PWE3 applications, this issue 
        is addressed by forcing the first nibble of the generic control 
        word or of the preferred control word to a value of zero [1]. 
        However, the SONET PW control word [2] does not comply with 
        this requirement. The SONET encapsulation addresses this issue 
        by preceding the SONET control word with a MPLS/PW PID to 
        disambiguate its payload from an IP packet. 
      
     b. The second one has to do with the ability to identify in PE, 
        MPLS or PW OAM messages, such as Y.1711 [3], LSP-Ping [4], or 
        VCCV [5]. Y.1711 messages are MPLS control packets, while LSP-
        Ping and VCCV are IP control packets. All can be inserted in a 
        non-IP LSP in the case of PWE3 applications. A PE can make use

        of the MPLS/PW PID to indicate to the remote PE that the 
        payload is an OAM packet without the need for a special label 
        value. 
      
     c. The third one is about making sure that a MPLS or a PW OAM 
        packet follows exactly the same path as the user traffic if 
        ECMP or similar load sharing mechanisms are used in the 
        network. This is fairly important since the whole idea of OAM 
        packet is to check the sanity and to troubleshoot the path user 
        packets follow through the network. The currently proposed MPLS 
        or PW OAM messages rely on a reserved label value to carry 
        these messages. For example, LSP-Ping makes use of the router 
        alert label value while Y.1711 OAM makes use of the OAM alert 
        label value. In both cases, another label is pushed into the 
        stack and thus the hashing algorithm of some ECMP 
        implementations may cause the OAM packet to follow a different 
        path from the user packet. If a MPLS/PW PID is used instead of 
        a special label value, this problem can be resolved. A proposal 
        for MPLS/PW PID to address this issue was made in draft-allan-
        mpls-pid-00.txt [6]. 
       
     This draft proposes to extend the use of the MPLS/PW PID to 
     identify user plane protocols carried in the LSP/PW payload. The 
     main application is interworking of different link layers over a 
     MPLS network, where each data link layer is terminated locally in 
     a PE. The MPLS/PW PID allows the use of a single multiprotocol PW 
     between any two user sites. The issues that are resolved by this 
     method are explained in Appendix A. 
      
     Appendix A also discusses the use the MPLS/PW PID to identify 
     different types of OAM messages in a PW in such a way to address 
     issues (b) and (c) above. 
      
      
  3    Extended MPLS/PW PID 
      
     The proposed structure of the MPLS/PW PID is compatible with the 
     MPLS payload type identifier in the PWE3 architecture document 
     [1]. Furthermore, it is compatible with RFC 2684 (Multiprotocol 
     over ATM), RFC 2427 (Multiprotocol over Frame Relay), and RFC 2878 
     (Bridging over PPP). 
      
     Support for this format of the PID is only needed when there are 
     multiple protocol types being transmitted over the same PW.  It is 
     unnecessary when there is a single protocol even if this single 
     protocol multiplexes other protocols. 
      
     When only partial support is provided for this PID, the handling 
     of multiple alternatives referred to in section 3.2 should be 
     examined.

  3.2      User-Plane Protocol Identification Details 
      
     The user plane encapsulation follows the procedures in the 
     NLPID/SNAP encapsulation in RFC 2427 (Multiprotocol over Frame 
     Relay). Where there are multiple alternatives to identify a 
     specific protocol, the use of the representation with the lowest 
     PA possible is required. For example, an IP datagram is 
     represented using PA=1 and an ISO NLPID=0xCC. 
      
     PA=1: ISO NLPID value other than 0x80 (32 bits) 
      
      0                   1                   2                   3

     The following ISO NLPID values are supported using this 
     configuration: 
     0x81    ISO CLNP 
     0x82    ISO ESIS 
     0x83    ISO ISIS

     Note: this appendix is not intended to be part of the 
     specification of the MPLS/PW PID. It is only provided to highlight 
     an application of the MPLS/PW PID. The content of this appendix 
     will be moved to a separate draft in the next revision of this 
     draft. 
      
     Figure 2 shows an example of interworking of different link layers 
     over MPLS.

          Figure 2: Interworking of different link layers over MPLS 
                                       
     Each AC can carry multiple higher layer protocols. This type of 
     interworking can be achieved in three different ways. Each method 
     is valid and has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
      
          1. Extend one link layer to the remote PE:  
             for example, the ATM link layer between CE3 and PE3 in 
             Figure 2 can be extended to PE2 using the PWE3 ATM-MPLS 
             encapsulations [9]. In PE2, the ATM PW is terminated and 
             the corresponding ATM AAL5 payload is reconstructed. Then 
             ATM and Ethernet link layers are interworked and the 
             corresponding PID fields are translated. The same thing 
             can be done for the FR link between CE1 and PE1 using a FR 
             PW towards PE2. Note that extending the Ethernet link 
             layer makes only sense if it is done all the way to the 
             ATM and FR CEs using a bridged encapsulation over the FR 
             and ATM links, and Ethernet PWs between the PEs. 
             Otherwise, PE1 and PE3 will need to insert a (fake) MAC 
             address for the FR and ATM interfaces on CE1 and CE3 in

             This method has the advantage of reusing existing PW 
             encapsulations specified in the PWE3 working group. It 
             also simplifies the interworking with MPLS since it does 
             not require the identification of the higher layer 
             protocols carried in an AC.  
             However, it makes the assumption that a PE will need to 
             terminate multiple L2 over MPLS encapsulations even if it 
             does not support those L2 interface types. For example, 
             PE2 might only have Ethernet and MPLS interfaces and not 
             ATM interfaces. In order to use this method, it will need 
             to terminate and process ATM PWs as specified in [9]. 
           
          2. Set up multiple pseudo-wires for each AC:  
             This method is described in [8]. In this case, each link 
             layer is terminated locally in a PE which inspects each 
             packetÆs PID to select the PW dedicated to each protocol 
             type. Therefore, multiple PWs need to be set up for each 
             AC. In the case where IP packets are routed over the AC 
             while all other protocols are bridged over the AC, this 
             method reduces to the set up of 2 parallel pseudo-wires 
             for each AC: an IP PW and an Ethernet PW. 
              
             This method has the advantage of using the current PW 
             model of inferring the protocol carried in the PW from the 
             label value. In other words, each PW carries only one 
             protocol type. 
              
             The disadvantage of this method is that it requires the 
             association of multiple PWs to a single AC. This is a 
             change to the current forwarding behavior of a PW. That 
             is, the traffic received on a AC is forwarded over a PW 
             based on the attachment circuit and the PID in the link 
             layer encapsulation. 
              
             There are also cases where one wants to avoid splitting 
             the path of the carried protocols. For example, the CE in 
             Figure 2 could be a device of another service provider who 
             runs IS-IS as its IGP while the rest of the traffic is IP. 
             In normal operation, a failure of the datapath is detected 
             by the IS-IS routing plane since routing packets follow 
             the same path as user packets. If the IP PW fails while 
             the IS-IS PW is still up, there is no way to let the IS-IS 
             routing know about the failure except by tearing down the 
             IS-IS PW. The tearing down of a group of PWs when one of 
             them fails is not desirable for other types of user 
             protocols who do not have such kind of dependency. 
           
          3. Set up a multiprotocol PW and translate the PID: 
             In this method, each link layer is terminated locally in a 
             PE which inspects each received packet in an AC and 
             translates the link layer PID into a PW PID. The PW PID 
             has the format proposed in Section 3 of this document.

             This method allows the creation of a single multiprotocol 
             PW to carry all protocols in an AC.  
              
             Consider the example of the traffic between CE1 and CE2 in 
             Figure 2. The CE device could belong to a service provider 
             running IS-IS as its IGP. The interworking here is between 
             an Ethernet interface and an rfc2427 routed FR DLCI with 
             IP and ISIS routing traffic.  The ISIS routing traffic can 
             be carried over the same PW as the IP traffic by using an 
             extended PID with PA=1 and NLPID=0x83.  The NLPID is 
             interworked to 802.3 LLC on the Ethernet side of the PW by 
             adding the appropriate LLC of FEFE03 using the same 
             mapping as defined in FRF 8.1 [10]. 
   
             This method has the advantage of requiring a single PW to 
             carry multiple user protocols over MPLS. It maintains the 
             same path for both user and control plane protocols of the 
             customer of the network. Finally, it provides a consistent 
             operation with existing FR-ATM service interworking 
             deployments. 
              
             The disadvantage of this method is that the PE needs to 
             inspect the received traffic on a PW packet by packet in 
             order to translate the PID. Note however that the PW 
             forwarding paradigm is not changed. Forwarding is still 
             based on the label and the attachment circuit for each 
             direction respectively. PID translation can be viewed as 
             part of payload manipulation. 
   
   

  7.1      Interworking Considerations 
      
     Regardless of which of the 3 above methods is used to perform 
     interworking of different link layers over MPLS, there are two 
     orthogonal issues to resolve: 
      
     a. Identification of multiple higher-layer protocols:  
        When a CE multiplexes multiple protocols in a single AC, it 
        indicates the protocol type in a protocol identifier (PID) 
        field in the link layer encapsulation. For example, RFC 2684 
        specifies the format for this field for an ATM/AAL5 link layer. 
        A PE examines the PID of each packet received in a AC to either 
        select the PW dedicated to this protocol (method 2) or to 
        translate the link layer PID into a PW PID(method 3). In the 
        case of method 1, the PE performs a translation of the PID 
        between two link layers, for instance ATM/AAL5 and Ethernet in 
        the example above. 
      
     b. L3 protocol dependency on the type of link layer:  
        Consider again the example of IS-IS traffic and IP traffic 
        carried between CE1 and CE2 in Figure 2. The operation of ISIS

  Internet Draft    draft-aissaoui-extended-pid-01.txt               October 2003 
   
        over a PW can treat the link as a broadcast link or a point-to-
        point link.  When it is point-to-point (i.e., only one CE 
        device on the Ethernet end), the procedures in draft-ietf-isis-
        igp-p2p-over-lan [11] will apply.  When it is broadcast, there 
        can be multiple CE routers on the Ethernet AC.  The preferred 
        choice in this particular case is to change the FR AC to 
        bridged encapsulation and use an Ethernet PW.  This will allow 
        the FR attached CE (CE2) to properly participate when presented 
        with packets with the three multicast MAC addresses AllISs, 
        AllL1ISs, and AllL2ISs.  If the FR AC is not or cannot be 
        changed to bridged encapsulation, the Ethernet attached PE will 
        need to assume that all ISIS packets received across the PW 
        should be prepended with the AllISs destination MAC or dig into 
        the packet to determine the MAC to use based on the packet 
        type.  The procedures for ARP Mediation [12] need to be applied 
        to determine a source MAC address. 
         
      

  7.2      Application of the Extended MPLS/PW PID to MPLS/PW OAM 
      
     In order to address issues (b) and (c) in Section 2, the MPLS/PW 
     PID can be used to identify an MPLS/PW OAM message carried in a 
     PW. This is an alternative to the router alert label value in LSP 
     Ping/VCCV and to the OAM alert label value in Y.1711 MPLS OAM.  
      
     An IP control packet (LSP Ping/VCCV) inserted in a PW is 
     identified by including the MPLS/PW PID just below the bottom of 
     the MPLS label stack as explained in [5]. The PA field is set to 0 
     to indicate a MPLS/PW control plane protocol. The PID field is a 
     PPP DLL and is set to the value indicating an IPv4 or IPv6 packet. 
      
     Similarly, a Y.1711 OAM message is identified through a PA=0 and a 
     specific value of the PPP DLL to be assigned by IANA.
