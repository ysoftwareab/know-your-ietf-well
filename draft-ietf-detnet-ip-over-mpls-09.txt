1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by
   a network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides a capability for the
   delivery of data flows with extremely low packet loss rates and
   bounded end-to-end delivery latency.  General background and concepts
   of DetNet can be found in the DetNet Architecture [RFC8655].

   This document specifies use of the IP DetNet encapsulation over an
   MPLS network.  It maps the IP data plane encapsulation described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] to the DetNet MPLS data plane defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

3.  DetNet IP Data Plane Overview

   Figure 1 illustrates an IP DetNet, with an MPLS based DetNet network
   as a sub-network between the relay nodes.  An IP flow is mapped to
   one or more PWs and MPLS (TE) LSPs.  The end systems still originate
   IP encapsulated traffic, identified as DetNet flows.  The relay nodes
   follow procedures defined in Section 4 to map each DetNet flow to
   MPLS LSPs.  While not shown, relay nodes can provide service sub-
   layer functions such as PREOF using DetNet over MPLS, and this is
   indicated by the solid line for the MPLS facing portion of the
   Service component.  Note that the Transit node is MPLS (TE) LSP aware
   and performs switching based on MPLS labels, and need not have any
   specific knowledge of the DetNet service or the corresponding DetNet
   flow identification.  See Section 4 for details on the mapping of IP
   flows to MPLS, and [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] for general support of
   DetNet services using MPLS.

4.  IP over DetNet MPLS

   This section defines how IP encapsulated flows are carried over a
   DetNet MPLS data plane as defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  Since
   both Non-DetNet and DetNet IP packet are identical on the wire, this
   section is applicable to any node that supports IP over DetNet MPLS,
   and this section refers to both cases as DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS.

4.1.  IP Over DetNet MPLS Data Plane Scenarios

   An example use of DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS is presented here.

   Figure 1 illustrates IP DetNet enabled End Systems (hosts) connected
   to DetNet (DN) enabled IP networks, operating over a DetNet aware
   MPLS network.  In this Figure we have a case where the Relay nodes
   act as T-PEs and sit at the boundary of the MPLS domain since the
   non-MPLS domain is DetNet aware.  This case is very similar to the
   DetNet MPLS Network Figure 2 in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  However, in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] Figure 2, the T-PEs are located at the end
   system and MPLS spans the whole DetNet service.  The primary
   difference in this document is that the Relay nodes are at the edges
   of the MPLS domain and therefore function as T-PEs, and that MPLS
   service sub-layer functions are not provided over the DetNet IP
   network.  The transit node functions shown above are identical to
   those described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

   Figure 2 illustrates how relay nodes can provide service protection
   over an MPLS domain.  In this case, CE1 and CE2 are IP DetNet end
   systems which are interconnected via a MPLS domain such as described
   in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  Note that R1 and R3 sit at the edges of
   an MPLS domain and therefore are similar to T-PEs, while R2 sits in
   the middle of the domain and is therefore similar to an S-PE.

    Figure 2: Service Protection Over DetNet MPLS Network for DetNet IP

   Figure 1 illustrates DetNet enabled End Systems connected to DetNet
   (DN) enabled MPLS network.  A similar situation occurs when end
   systems are not DetNet aware.  In this case, edge nodes sit at the
   boundary of the MPLS domain since it is also a DetNet domain
   boundary.  The edge nodes provide DetNet service proxies for the end
   applications by initiating and terminating DetNet service for the
   application's IP flows.  While the node types differ, there is
   essentially no difference in data plane processing between relay and
   edges.  There are likely to be differences in controller plane
   operation, particularly when distributed control plane protocols are
   used.

   It is still possible to provide DetNet service protection for non-
   DetNet aware end systems.  This case is basically the same as
   Figure 2, with the exception that CE1 and CE2 are non-DetNet aware
   end systems and R1 and R3 become edge nodes.

4.2.  DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Encapsulation

   The basic encapsulation approach is to treat a DetNet IP flow as an
   app-flow from the DetNet MPLS perspective.  The corresponding example
   DetNet Sub-Network format is shown in Figure 3.

         Figure 3: Example DetNet IP over MPLS Sub-Network Formats

   In Figure 3 "App-Flow" indicates the payload carried by the DetNet IP
   data plane.  "IP" and "NProto" indicate the fields described in
   Section 5.1.1.  (IP Header Information) and Section 5.1.2.  (Other
   Protocol Header Information) of [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip], respectively.
   "App-Flow for MPLS" indicates that an individual DetNet IP flow is
   the payload from the perspective of the DetNet MPLS data plane
   defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

   Per Section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls], the DetNet MPLS data plane
   uses a single S-Label to support a single app flow.  DetNet IP Flow
   Identification Procedures in Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip]
   states that a single DetNet flow is identified based on IP, and next
   level protocol, header information.  Section 4.4.  (Aggregation
   Considerations) of [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] defines the ways in which
   aggregation is supported through the use of prefixes, wildcards,
   lists, and port ranges.  Collectively, this results in the fairly
   straightforward procedures defined in the next section.

   As shown in Figure 2, DetNet relay nodes are responsible for the
   mapping of a DetNet flow, at the service sub-layer, from the IP to
   MPLS DetNet data planes and back again.  Their related DetNet IP over
   DetNet MPLS data plane operation is comprised of two sets of
   procedures: the mapping of flow identifiers, and ensuring proper
   traffic treatment.

Internet-Draft    DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Data Plane     October 2020


   Mapping of IP to DetNet MPLS is similar for DetNet IP flows and IP
   flows.  The six-tuple of IP is mapped to the S-Label in both cases.
   The various fields may be mapped or ignored when going from IP to
   MPLS.

5.  IP over DetNet MPLS Procedures

   The main differences of mapping IP to DetNet MPLS (compared to plain
   MPLS) are that (1) there is a mandatory flow identification to make
   the forwarding decision (i.e., forwarding is not based on FEC), (2)
   the d-CW (DetNet Control Word) is mandatory for the MPLS
   encapsulation and (3) during forwarding over the DetNet MPLS network
   DetNet flow specific treatment is needed.

5.1.  DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Flow Identification and Aggregation
      Procedures

   A DetNet relay node (ingress T-PE) that sends a DetNet IP flow over a
   DetNet MPLS network MUST map a DetNet IP flow, as identified in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] into a single MPLS DetNet flow and MUST process
   it in accordance to the procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].
   PRF MAY be supported at the MPLS level for DetNet IP flows sent over
   an DetNet MPLS network.  Aggregation MAY be supported as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] Section 4.4.  Aggregation considerations in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] MAY be used to identify an individual DetNet IP
   flow.  The provisioning of the mapping of DetNet IP flows to DetNet
   MPLS flows MUST be supported via configuration, e.g., via the
   controller plane.

   A DetNet relay node (egress T-PE) MAY be provisioned to handle
   packets received via the DetNet MPLS data plane as DetNet IP flows.
   A single incoming DetNet MPLS flow MAY be treated as a single DetNet
   IP flow, without examination of IP headers.  Alternatively, packets
   received via the DetNet MPLS data plane MAY follow the normal DetNet
   IP flow identification procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip]
   Section 5.1.

   An implementation MUST support the provisioning for handling any
   packet flows received via DetNet MPLS data plane as DetNet IP flows
   via configuration.  Note that such configuration MAY include support
   from PREOF on the incoming DetNet MPLS flow.

   Note: using Layer-4 (L4) transport protocols e.g., for multipath are
   out of scope of this document both for a single flow and aggregate
   flows.

Internet-Draft    DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Data Plane     October 2020


5.2.  DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Traffic Treatment Procedures

   The traffic treatment required for a particular DetNet IP flow is
   provisioned via configuration or the controller plane.  When a DetNet
   IP flow is sent over DetNet MPLS, a DetNet relay node MUST ensure
   that the provisioned DetNet IP traffic treatment is provided at the
   forwarding sub-layer as described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls]
   Section 5.2.  Note that the PRF function MAY be utilized when sending
   IP over MPLS.

   Traffic treatment for DetNet IP flows received over the DetNet MPLS
   data plane MUST follow Section 5.3 DetNet IP Traffic Treatment
   Procedures in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

6.  Management and Control Information Summary

   The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
   support DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS at the MPLS ingress node:

   o  Each MPLS App-Flow is identified using the IP flow identification
      information as defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  The information
      is summarized in Section 5.1 of that document, and includes all
      wildcards, port ranges and the ability to ignore specific IP
      fields.

   o  The DetNet MPLS service that is to be used to send the matching IP
      traffic.  This matching information is provided in
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] Section 5.1, and includes both service and
      traffic delivery information.

   The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
   support DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS at the MPLS egress node:

   o  S-Label values that are carrying MPLS over IP encapsulated
      traffic.

   o  For each S-Label, how the received traffic is to be handled.  The
      traffic may be processed according as any other DetNet IP traffic
      as defined in this document or in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip], or the
      traffic may be directly treated as an MPLS App-flow for additional
      processing according to [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

   It is the responsibility of the DetNet controller plane to properly
   provision both flow identification information and the flow-specific
   resources needed to provide the traffic treatment to meet each flow's
   service requirements.  This applies for aggregated and individual
   flows.

7.  Security Considerations

   General security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-security].  DetNet MPLS and DetNet IP security
   considerations equally apply to this document and are described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   Security aspects which are unique to DetNet are those whose aim is to
   protect the support of specific quality of service aspects of DetNet,
   which are primarily to deliver data flows with extremely low packet
   loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery latency.

   The primary considerations for the data plane are to maintain
   integrity of data and delivery of the associated DetNet service
   traversing the DetNet network.  Application flows can be protected
   through whatever means is provided by the underlying technology.  For
   example, encryption may be used, such as that provided by IPSec
   [RFC4301] for IP flows and/or by an underlying sub-net using MACSec
   [IEEE802.1AE-2018] for IP over Ethernet (Layer-2) flows.

   From a data plane perspective this document does not add or modify
   any header information.

   At the management and control level DetNet flows are identified on a
   per-flow basis, which may provide controller plane attackers with
   additional information about the data flows (when compared to
   controller planes that do not include per-flow identification).  This
   is an inherent property of DetNet which has security implications
   that should be considered when determining if DetNet is a suitable
   technology for any given use case.

   To provide uninterrupted availability of the DetNet service,
   provisions can be made against DOS attacks and delay attacks.  To
   protect against DOS attacks, excess traffic due to malicious or
   malfunctioning devices can be prevented or mitigated, for example
   through the use of existing mechanism such as policing and shaping
   applied at the input of a DetNet domain.  To prevent DetNet packets
   from being delayed by an entity external to a DetNet domain, DetNet
   technology definition can allow for the mitigation of Man-In-The-
   Middle attacks, for example through use of authentication and
   authorization of devices within the DetNet domain.
