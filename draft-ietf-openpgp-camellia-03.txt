Internet-Draft       The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP           April 2008


1.  Introduction

   The OpenPGP protocol [RFC4880] can support many different symmetric
   ciphers.  This document presents the necessary information to use the
   Camellia [RFC3713] cipher in the OpenPGP protocol.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Camellia

   Camellia is specified in [RFC3713].  It is a 128-bit block cipher (as
   are AES and Twofish in OpenPGP), that supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and
   256-bit keys.  This document defines the use of Camellia in OpenPGP.

     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+
     | Camellia Key Length | OpenPGP Symmetric-Key Algorithm Number |
     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+
     |         128         |                  XXXX                  |
     |         192         |                  YYYY                  |
     |         256         |                  ZZZZ                  |
     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+

    [[To be allocated by IANA.  Please fill this in: presumably XXXX ==
                     11, YYYY == 12, and ZZZZ == 13]]

   OpenPGP applications MAY implement Camellia.  If implemented,
   Camellia may be used in any place in OpenPGP where a symmetric cipher
   is usable, and is subject to the same usage requirements (such as its
   presence in the Preferred Symmetric Algorithms signature subpacket)
   as the other symmetric ciphers in OpenPGP.

   While the OpenPGP algorithm preferences system prevents
   interoperability problems with public key encrypted messages, if
   Camellia (or any other optional cipher) is used for encrypting
   private keys, there could be interoperability problems when migrating
   a private key from one system to another.  A similar issue can arise
   when using an optional cipher for symmetric-only encrypted messages,
   as this OpenPGP message type does not perform cipher negotiation.
   Those using optional ciphers in this manner should take care they are
   using a cipher that their intended recipient can decrypt.

4.  Security Considerations

   At publication time, there are no known weak keys for Camellia, and
   the Camellia algorithm is believed to be strong.  However, as with
   any technology involving cryptography, implementers should check the
   current literature, as well as the Camellia home page at
   <http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/>, to determine if Camellia has
   been found to be vulnerable to attack.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA to assign three algorithm numbers from
   the registry of OpenPGP Symmetric-Key Algorithms that was created by
   [RFC4880].
