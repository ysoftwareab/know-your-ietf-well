                       Routing Optimization with SDN
                       draft-yang-dmm-sdn-dmm-04.txt


Abstract

   DMM is a mobility protocol which has mobility functions to solve the
   existing problems in the current centralized ones. However, when a
   mobile node moves to another anchor, the previous flow is forwarded
   by the previous router. For this reason, the routing optimization
   could be an issue. This draft proposes a routing optimization method
   in distributed anchor architecture. In this draft, we applied the
   SDN concept to DMM architecture for routing optimization.

1. Introduction

   DMM is a technology for distributed network-based mobility
   management protocol, which has been proposed to solve the problems
   in the centralized mobility protocols such as PMIPv6 [RFC5213],
   MIPv6 [RFC6275]. In the current research of distributed mobility
   management, there are two methods for mobility management.

   One is the fully distributed mobility management method. The other
   is the partially distributed mobility method.

   In partially distributed method, it decouples the control plane and
   data plane. It uses a centralized method for control plane and uses
   a distributed method for data plane. In fully distributed method, it
   uses a distributed method for both control plane and data plane.

   In Partially Distributed, there is one entity which that stores the
   BCEs allocated for the MNs in the mobility domain. In the current
   network, when mobile node moves to a new anchor, tunneling must be
   used between the P-MAAR and a new anchor and the previous flow is
   forwarded from the P-MAAR to the new anchor until the flow is
   finished. Therefore, routing may not be optimized in term of
   bandwidth overhead.



2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   Software Defined Networking  (SDN)

   The following terms are defined and used in this document:

   DMM service (distributed mobility management service)

      Function that store the BCEs and support mobility management, it's
      running on controller.

   The following terms used in this document are defined in A PMIPv6-
   based solution for Distributed Mobility Management [draft-bernardos-
   dmm-pmip-03]

   Mobility Anchor and Access Router (MAAR)

   Central Mobility Database (CMD)

   Previous MAAR  (P-MAAR)

   Serving MAAR (S-MAAR)

   CN MAAR (CN-MAAR)

3. Motivation of DMM Optimization

   In current distributed mobility management, mobile node is allocated
   IP from initiate anchor. if mobile node moves to another router,
   mobile node received data through the tunneling between P-MAAR and
   S-MAAR. that is, tunneling is necessary to receive data from
   previous router and this method has still optimization routing

   problem. In this draft, we propose a routing optimization scheme
   that applied SDN concept to DMM architecture.

4. DMM architecture with SDN concept for routing Optimization

   The purpose of this draft is to make optimized routing path from the
   DMM architecture. If data path is controlled by SDN controller in
   the DMM architecture with a DMM service that stored mobile node
   status, mobile node data path is possible to set up by optimized
   path. Moreover, tunneling is not necessary when receiving data from
   previous router. The architecture of proposed method is shown in the
   figure 1.

                         Figure 1. DMM architecture with SDN

   In current distributed mobility management, Upon the MN's attachment
   to initiate router, the binding update message is sent to CMD that
   stored mobile node status and session DB replies to initiate router
   with PBA including prefix. When the mobile node moves from its
   current router to new router, new router sends a binding update
   message to CMD. CMD sends to update information related to mobile
   node. The previous router that received update information from CMD
   establishes a tunnel with the new router to transmit data.

4.1. Handover process and potential optimization routing

   In proposed architecture, mobile node is supported mobility
   management by binding update to controller with DMM service.
   Moreover, data path can be set up without data tunneling in our
   method. because data path is set up by flow table which made by SDN
   controller. That is, mobile node can be supported optimized path by
   flow table, without tunneling. There are several benefits and
   potential ways to support routing optimization.

   As a Figure2, When mobile node attach initiate router , MAAR1 sends
   a Packet in Message with MN's ID, for registration to the controller.
   Upon accepting this Packet in Message, the controller sends a Packet
   out Message including the mobile node's prefix1 and controller
   stored mobile node information in Binding cache entry.
   For set up the data path, the controller sends a Flow Modify message
    to set up the flow table in the P-MAAR.
   If the mobile node moves to the S-MAAR, the S-MAAR sends a Packet in
   Message with mobile node's ID, prefix1, new location of mobile
   node(S-MAAR). The controller which receives packet in message will
   check and update BCE.
   Upon receiving this Packet in Message, the Controller sends Flow
   Modify message to P-MAAR, S-MAAR to set up the new data path. On
   receiving flow modify messages, the S-MAAR and P-MAAR will update
   their routing tables. Then the data session will flow from P-MAAR to
   new S-MAAR and finally to the mobile node.


4.2. Advantage of DMM architecture with SDN

   SDN which has a flexible way to set up data flow can provide a
   solution to support efficient route in the DMM architecture. If the
   mobile node moves to another router, this method can solve the
   routing optimization problem by modifying flow tables. Besides, the
   SDN doesn't only allow us to control the data path but also the
   other kinds of messages between routers.

4.3. Optimization routing

   As a Figure2, When mobile node attach new router, the data session
   Will flow from P-MAAR to new S-MAAR. Even mobile node Move to 
   another router, data path will be formed through the P-MAAR. 
   It will be occur delay and make the non-optimization path. However,
   In the SDN based DMM, the controller can modify flow table to make 
   the optimization data path.

4.4. The Function of DMM Service

   As a Figure3, When mobile node attach new router, Previous CMD
   can't support optimization path since it has only Binding 
   cache information and session information. However, DMM Service 
   function can support optimization path since it can know all 
   current network status and calculate optimization path with Binding 
   cache information.

	     Figure 4. Functional Architecture for Supporting
                      FPC Protocol in SDN-based DMM



   To deploy DMM service on the SDN controller, policy-based network 
   control model which is defined in [DMM FPC Protocol] can be used. 
   FPC protocol is a semantic protocol for forwarding policy 
   configuration between control and data plane of mobility management
   functions. In the SDN-based DMM environment, as a Figure 4, 
   DMM service entity includes mobility control plane. 
   FPC protocol may be used between SDN controller and DMM control 
   plane. Mobility management policy which received via FPC agent 
   should be translated for SDN Controller as an interpretable way.

   it is required to support multi domain with mobility management. In
   the previous draft[I-D.ietf-dmm-distributed-anchoring],they describe
   the solution to support inter-domain operation for mobility
   management. However, tunneling and new entity(such as new LMA) are
   necessary to support mobility management for multi domain since CMD
   doesn't have any information of other domain. In this draft, 
   controllers can communicate via East/Westbound interfaces to make 
   a path between edge routers in each different domain.

                Figure 5. Data flow in Different Domains

   As a figure5, data path is set up to send data packet from router in
   the domain1 to router in the domain2. Therefore, this architecture 
   can support mobility management in multi domain.

   To support mobility, when MN moves to another domain where managed
   by another SDN controller, such interfaces described in Figure 6 are
   needed. DMM services which perform over each SDN controllers may
   exchange mobility signaling messages such as Proxy Binding Update
   (PBU) messages, similar with communication between DMM control plane
   entities. After the rules which is changed by DMM service is sent to
   SDN controller via Northbound API. SDN controller may find edge
   router in different domain using East/West interfaces to establish
   inter-domain forwarding path.
