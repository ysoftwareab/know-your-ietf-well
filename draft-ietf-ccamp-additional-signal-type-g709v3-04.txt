Abstract

RFC 4328 and RFC 7139 provide Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic
Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling extensions to control the full set
of Optical Transport Network (OTN) features. However, these
specifications do not cover the additional Optical channel Data
Unit (ODU) containers defined in G.Sup43 (ODU1e, ODU3e1 and
ODU3e2). This document defines new signal types for these
additional containers.

1. Introduction

   [RFC7139] updates the Optical channel Data Unit (ODU)-related
   portions of [RFC4328] to provide Resource ReserVation Protocol-
   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions to support control for
   [G.709-v3] in the OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC
   objects. However, it does not specify signal types for the
   containers defined in [G.Sup43] (ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2).
   This document provides RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support
   these additional signal types.

   These containers are non-standard data plane frame formats (not
   defined in ITU-T Recommendations). They are among some of the
   intra-domain approaches used in networks for transport of
   10GBASE-R signals in optical transport networks. As a
   Supplement, [G.Sup43], does not guarantee interoperability in
   the data plane for these containers.

2. RSVP-TE extension for Additional Signal Types

   [RFC7139] defines the format of Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM
   SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects. These traffic
   parameters have a signal type field. This document defines the
   signal type for ODU1e, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2 as defined in the IANA
   considerations section. They are allocated from the
   Specification Required policy added to the subregistry by
   [RFC7892].


3. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues
   above those identified in [RFC7139].

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry called "Generalized Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" with a subregistry
   called "OTN Signal Type". IANA is requested to make three
   further allocations from this registry under the Specification
   Required policy for ODU1e, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2 as follows:

   Value                       Type
   -----                       ----
   TBD (IANA is requested      ODU1e  (10Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])
     to assign the value 23)
   TBD (IANA is requested      ODU3e1 (40Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])
     to assign the value 26)
   TBD (IANA is requested      ODU3e2 (40Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])
     to assign the value 27)


   These signaled types are carried in Traffic Parameters in OTN-
   TDM SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects [RFC7139].
