                   CDNI Control Interface / Triggers
                  draft-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-08

Abstract

   This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnection Control
   Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected
   CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The
   upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream
   CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it invalidates or
   purges metadata or content.  The upstream CDN can monitor the status
   of activity that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6707] introduces the problem scope for CDN Interconnection (CDNI)
   and lists the four categories of interfaces that may be used to
   compose a CDNI solution (Control, Metadata, Request Routing,
   Logging).

   [RFC7336] expands on the information provided in [RFC6707] and
   describes each of the interfaces and the relationships between them
   in more detail.

   This document describes the "CI/T" interface, "CDNI Control interface
   / Triggers".  It does not consider those parts of the control
   interface that relate to configuration, bootstrapping or
   authentication of CDN Interconnect interfaces.  Section 4 of
   [RFC7337] identifies the requirements specific to the CI interface,
   requirements applicable to the CI/T interface are CI-1 to CI-6.

   o  Section 2 outlines the model for the CI/T Interface at a high
      level.

   o  Section 3 describes collections of Trigger Status Resources.

   o  Section 4 defines the web service provided by the dCDN.

   o  Section 5 lists properties of CI/T Commands and Status Resources.

   o  Section 6 contains example messages.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology defined in [RFC6707].

2.  Model for CDNI Triggers

   A CI/T Command, sent from the uCDN to the dCDN, is a request for the
   dCDN to do some work relating to data associated with content
   requests originating from the uCDN.

   There are two types of CI/T Command, CI/T Trigger Commands and CI/T
   Cancel Commands.  The CI/T Cancel Command can be used to request
   cancellation of an earlier CI/T Trigger Command.  A CI/T Trigger
   Command is of one of the following types:

   o  preposition - used to instruct the dCDN to fetch metadata from the
      uCDN, or content from any origin including the uCDN.

   o  invalidate - used to instruct the dCDN to revalidate specific
      metadata or content before re-using it.

   o  purge - used to instruct the dCDN to delete specific metadata or
      content.

   The CI/T interface is a web service offered by the dCDN.  It allows
   CI/T commands to be issued, and triggered activity to be tracked.
   When the dCDN accepts a CI/T Command it creates a resource describing
   status of the triggered activity, a Trigger Status Resource.  The
   uCDN can poll Trigger Status Resources to monitor progress.

   The dCDN maintains at least one collection of Trigger Status
   Resources for each uCDN.  Each uCDN only has access to its own
   collections, the locations of which are shared when CDN
   interconnection is established.

   To trigger activity in the dCDN, the uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the
   collection of Trigger Status Resources.  If the dCDN accepts the CI/T
   Command, it creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its
   location to the uCDN.  To monitor progress, the uCDN can GET the
   Trigger Status Resource.  To request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger
   Command the uCDN can POST to the collection of Trigger Status
   Resources, or simply DELETE the Trigger Status Resource.

   In addition to the collection of all Trigger Status Resources for the
   uCDN, the dCDN can maintain filtered views of that collection.  These
   filtered views are defined in Section 3 and include collections of
   Trigger Status Resources corresponding to active and completed CI/T
   Trigger Commands.  These collections provide a mechanism for polling
   the status of multiple jobs.

   Figure 1 is an example showing the basic message flow used by the
   uCDN to trigger activity in the dCDN, and for the uCDN to discover
   the status of that activity.  Only successful triggering is shown.
   Examples of the messages are given in Section 6.

              Figure 1: Basic CDNI Message Flow for Triggers

   The steps in Figure 1 are:

   1.  The uCDN triggers action in the dCDN by posting a CI/T Command to
       a collection of Trigger Status Resources,
       "http://dcdn.example.com/triggers/uCDN".  The URL of this was
       given to the uCDN when the CI/T interface was established.

   2.  The dCDN authenticates the request, validates the CI/T Command
       and, if it accepts the request, creates a new Trigger Status
       Resource.

   3.  The dCDN responds to the uCDN with an HTTP 201 response status,
       and the location of the Trigger Status Resource.

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   4.  The uCDN can poll, possibly repeatedly, the Trigger Status
       Resource in the dCDN.

   5.  The dCDN responds with the Trigger Status Resource, describing
       progress or results of the CI/T Trigger Command.

   The remainder of this document describes the messages, Trigger Status
   Resources, and collections of Trigger Status Resources in more
   detail.

2.1.  Timing of Triggered Activity

   Timing of the execution of CI/T Commands is under the dCDN's control,
   including its start-time and pacing of the activity in the network.

   CI/T invalidate and purge commands MUST be applied to all data
   acquired before the command was accepted by the dCDN.  The dCDN
   SHOULD NOT apply CI/T invalidate and purge commands to data acquired
   after the CI/T Command was accepted, but this may not always be
   achievable so the uCDN cannot count on that.

   If the uCDN wishes to invalidate or purge content then immediately
   pre-position replacement content at the same URLs, it SHOULD ensure
   the dCDN has completed the invalidate/purge before initiating the
   prepositioning.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the dCDN pre-
   positions the new content, then immediately invalidates or purges it
   (as a result of the two uCDN requests running in parallel).

   Because the CI/T Command timing is under the dCDN's control, the dCDN
   implementation can choose whether to apply CI/T invalidate and purge
   commands to content acquisition that has already started when the
   command is received.

2.2.  Scope of Triggered Activity

   Each CI/T Command can operate on multiple metadata and content URLs.

   Multiple representations of an HTTP resource may share the same URL.
   CI/T Trigger Commands that invalidate or purge metadata or content
   apply to all resource representations with matching URLs.

   The dCDN MUST reject CI/T Commands from a uCDN that act on another
   uCDN's data.  Security considerations are discussed further in
   section Section 8.

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


2.3.  Trigger Results

   Possible states for a Trigger Status Resource are defined in section
   Section 5.2.3.

   The CI/T Trigger Command MUST NOT be reported as 'complete' until all
   actions have been completed successfully.  The reasons for failure,
   and URLs or Patterns affected, SHOULD be enumerated in the Trigger
   Status Resource.  For more detail, see section Section 4.7.

   If a dCDN is also acting as a uCDN in a cascade, it MUST forward CI/T
   Commands to any downstream CDNs that may be affected.  The CI/T
   Trigger Command MUST NOT be reported as 'complete' in a CDN until it
   is 'complete' in all of its downstream CDNs.  If a CI/T Trigger
   Command is reported as 'processed' in any dCDN, intermediate CDNs
   MUST NOT report 'complete', instead they must also report
   'processed'.  A CI/T Command MAY be reported as 'failed' as soon as
   it fails in a CDN or in any of its downstream CDNs.  A cancelled CI/T
   Trigger Command MUST be reported as 'cancelling' until it has been
   reported as 'cancelled', 'complete', or 'failed' by all dCDNs in a
   cascade.

3.  Collections of Trigger Status Resources

   As described in Section 2, Trigger Status Resources exist in the dCDN
   to report the status of activity triggered by each uCDN.

   A collection of Trigger Status Resources is a resource that contains
   a reference to each Trigger Status Resource in that collection.

   The dCDN MUST make a collection of a uCDN's Trigger Status Resources
   available to that uCDN.  This collection includes all of the Trigger
   Status Resources created for CI/T Commands from the uCDN that have
   been accepted by the dCDN, and have not yet been deleted by the uCDN,
   or expired and removed by the dCDN (as described in section
   Section 4.4).  Trigger Status Resources belonging to a uCDN MUST NOT
   be visible to any other CDN.  The dCDN could, for example, achieve
   this by offering different collection URLs to each uCDN, and/or by
   filtering the response based on the uCDN with which the HTTP client
   is associated.

   To trigger activity in a dCDN, or to cancel triggered activity, the
   uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the dCDN's collection of the uCDN's
   Trigger Status Resources.

   In order to allow the uCDN to check the status of multiple jobs in a
   single request, the dCDN SHOULD also maintain collections
   representing filtered views of the collection of all Trigger Status

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   Resources.  These filtered collections are optional-to-implement but,
   if implemented, the dCDN MUST include links to them in the collection
   of all Trigger Status Resources.  The filtered collections are:

   o  Pending - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      have been accepted, but not yet acted upon.

   o  Active - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      are currently being processed in the dCDN.

   o  Complete - Trigger Status Resources representing activity that
      completed successfully, and 'processed' CI/T Trigger Commands for
      which no further status updates will be made by the dCDN.

   o  Failed - Trigger Status Resources representing CI/T Commands that
      failes or were cancelled by the uCDN.

4.  CDNI Trigger Interface

   This section describes an interface to enable an upstream CDN to
   trigger activity in a downstream CDN.

   The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP, so dCDNs may make use of
   any HTTP feature when implementing the CI/T interface.  For example,
   a dCDN SHOULD make use of HTTP's caching mechanisms to indicate that
   a requested response/representation has not been modified, reducing
   the uCDN's processing needed to determine whether the status of
   triggered activity has changed.

   All dCDNs implementing CI/T MUST support the HTTP GET, HEAD, POST and
   DELETE methods as defined in [RFC7231].

   The only representation specified in this document is JSON,
   [RFC7159].  It MUST be supported by the uCDN and by the dCDN.

   The URL of the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources
   needs to be either discovered by, or configured in, the uCDN.  The
   mechanism for discovery of that URL is outside the scope of this
   document.

   CI/T Commands are POSTed to the dCDN's collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources.  If a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted by the dCDN,
   the dCDN creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its URI to
   the uCDN in an HTTP 201 response.  The triggered activity can then be
   monitored by the uCDN using that resource and the collections
   described in Section 3.

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   The URI of each Trigger Status Resource is returned to the uCDN when
   it is created, and URIs of all Trigger Status Resources are listed in
   the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  This means
   all Trigger Status Resources can be discovered by the uCDN, so dCDNs
   are free to assign whatever structure they desire to the URIs for CI/
   T resources.  Therefore uCDNs MUST NOT make any assumptions regarding
   the structure of CI/T URIs or the mapping between CI/T objects and
   their associated URIs.  URIs present in the examples in this document
   are purely illustrative and are not intended to impose a definitive
   structure on CI/T interface implementations.

4.1.  Creating Triggers

   To issue a CI/T Command, the uCDN makes an HTTP POST to the dCDN's
   collection of all of the uCDN's Trigger Status Resources.  The
   request body of that POST is a CI/T Command, as described in
   Section 5.1.1.

   The dCDN validates the CI/T Command, if it is malformed or the uCDN
   does not have sufficient access rights it MUST either respond with an
   appropriate 4xx HTTP error code and a Trigger Status Resource MUST
   NOT be created on the dCDN, or create a 'failed' Trigger Status
   Resource containing an appropriate error description.

   When a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted, the uCDN MUST create a new
   Trigger Status Resource which will convey a specification of the CI/T
   Command and its current status.  The HTTP response to the dCDN MUST
   have status code 201 and MUST convey the URI of the Trigger Status
   Resource in the Location header field.  The HTTP response SHOULD
   include the content of the newly created Trigger Status Resource,
   this is recommended particularly in cases where the CI/T Trigger
   Command has completed immediately.

   Once a Trigger Status Resource has been created the dCDN MUST NOT re-
   use its URI, even after that Trigger Status Resource has been
   removed.

   The dCDN SHOULD track and report on progress of CI/T Trigger
   Commands.  If the dCDN is not able to do that, it MUST indicate that
   it has accepted the request but will not be providing further status
   updates.  To do this, it sets the "status" of the Trigger Status
   Resource to "processed".  In this case, CI/T processing should
   continue as for a "complete" request, so the Trigger Status Resource
   MUST be added to the dCDN's collection of Complete Trigger Status
   Resources.  The dCDN SHOULD also provide an estimated completion time
   for the request, by using the "etime" property of the Trigger Status
   Resource.  This will allow the uCDN to schedule prepositioning after
   an earlier delete of the same URLs is expected to have finished.

   If the dCDN is able to track the execution of CI/T Commands and a CI/
   T Command is queued by the dCDN for later action, the "status"
   property of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "pending".  Once
   processing has started the "status" MUST be "active".  Finally, once
   the CI/T Command is complete, the status MUST be set to "complete" or
   "failed".

   A CI/T Trigger Command may result in no activity in the dCDN if, for
   example, it is an invalidate or purge request for data the dCDN has
   not yet acquired, or a prepopulate request for data it has already
   acquired and which is still valid.  In this case, the "status" of the
   Trigger Status Resource MUST be "processed" or "complete", and the
   Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to the dCDN's collection of
   Complete Trigger Status Resources.

   Once created, Trigger Status Resources can be cancelled or deleted by
   the uCDN, but not modified.  The dCDN MUST reject PUT and POST
   requests from the uCDN to Trigger Status Resources by responding with
   an appropriate HTTP status code, for example 405 "Method Not
   Allowed".

4.2.  Checking Status

   The uCDN has two ways to check progress of CI/T Commands it has
   issued to the dCDN, described in sections Section 4.2.1 and
   Section 4.2.2.

   To check for change in status of a Trigger Status Resource or
   collection of Trigger Status Resources without re-fetching the whole
   Resource or Collection, Entity Tags SHOULD be included by the dCDN
   for the uCDN to use as cache validators, as defined in [RFC7232].

   The dCDN SHOULD use the cache control headers for responses to GETs
   for Trigger Status Resources and Collections to indicate the
   frequency at which it recommends the uCDN should poll for change.

4.2.1.  Polling Trigger Status Resource collections

   The uCDN can fetch the collection of its Trigger Status Resources, or
   filtered views of that collection.

   This makes it possible to poll status of all CI/T Trigger Commands in
   a single request.  If the dCDN moves a Trigger Status Resource from
   the Active to the Completed collection, the uCDN can fetch the result
   of that activity.






Murray & Niven-Jenkins   Expires January 3, 2016               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP Entity Tags to
   monitor for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the whole
   collection.  An example of this is given in section Section 6.2.4.

4.2.2.  Polling Trigger Status Resources

   The uCDN has a URI provided by the dCDN for each Trigger Status
   Resource it has created, it may fetch that Trigger Status Resource at
   any time.

   This can be used to retrieve progress information, and to fetch the
   result of the CI/T Command.

   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP Entity Tags to
   monitor for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the Trigger
   Status Resource.

4.3.  Cancelling Triggers

   The uCDN can request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command by
   POSTing a CI/T Cancel Command to the collection of all Trigger Status
   Resources.

   Cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command is optional-to-implement in
   the dCDN.

   The dCDN MUST respond to the CI/T Cancel Command appropriately, for
   example with HTTP status code 200 "OK" if the cancellation has been
   processed and the CI/T Command is inactive, 202 "Accepted" if the
   command has been accepted but the CI/T Command remains active, or 501
   "Not Implemented" if cancellation is not supported by the dCDN.

   If cancellation of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is accepted by
   the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD NOT start processing of that activity.
   Issuing a CT/T cancel command for a "pending" Trigger Status Resource
   does not however guarantee that the corresponding activity will not
   be started, because the uCDN cannot control the timing of that
   activity.  Processing could, for example, start after the POST is
   sent by the uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.

   If cancellation of an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource
   is accepted by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T
   Command.  However, as with cancellation of a "pending" CI/T Command,
   the dCDN does not guarantee this.

   If the CI/T Command cannot be stopped immediately, the status in the
   corresponding Trigger Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelling",
   and the Trigger Status Resource MUST remain in the collection of

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   Trigger Status Resources for active CI/T Commands.  If processing is
   stopped before normal completion, the status value in the Trigger
   Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelled", and the Trigger Status
   Resource MUST be included in the collection of failed CT/T Trigger
   Commands.

   Cancellation of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   requires no processing in the dCDN, its status MUST NOT be changed to
   "cancelled".

4.4.  Deleting Triggers

   The uCDN can delete Trigger Status Resources at any time, using the
   HTTP DELETE method.  The effect is similar to cancellation, but no
   Trigger Status Resource remains afterwards.

   Once deleted, the references to a Trigger Status Resource MUST be
   removed from all Trigger Status Resource collections.  Subsequent
   requests to GET the deleted Trigger Status Resource SHOULD be
   rejected by the dCDN with an HTTP error.

   If a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the dCDN SHOULD
   NOT start processing of that activity.  Deleting a "pending" Trigger
   Status Resource does not however guarantee that it has not started
   because the uCDN cannot control the timing of that activity.
   Processing may, for example, start after the DELETE is sent by the
   uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.

   If an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the
   dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T Command.  However, as with
   deletion of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource, the dCDN does not
   guarantee this.

   Deletion of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource requires
   no processing in the dCDN other than deletion of the Trigger Status
   Resource.

4.5.  Expiry of Trigger Status Resources

   The dCDN can choose to automatically delete Trigger Status Resources
   some time after they become "complete", "processed", "failed" or
   "cancelled".  In this case, the dCDN will remove the Trigger Status
   Resource and respond to subsequent requests for it with an HTTP
   error.

   If the dCDN performs this housekeeping, it MUST have reported the
   length of time after which completed Trigger Status Resources will be
   deleted via a property of the collection of all Trigger Status



Murray & Niven-Jenkins   Expires January 3, 2016               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   Resources.  It is RECOMMENDED that Trigger Status Resources are not
   automatically deleted by the dCDN for at least 24 hours after they
   become "complete", "processed", "failed" or "cancelled".

   To ensure it is able to get the status of its Trigger Status
   Resources for completed and failed CI/T Commands, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the uCDN polling interval is less than the time after which
   records for completed activity will be deleted.

4.6.  Loop Detection and Prevention

   Given three CDNs, A, B and C.  If CDNs B and C delegate delivery of
   CDN A's content to each other, CDN A's CI/T Commands could be passed
   between CDNs B and C in a loop.  More complex networks of CDNs could
   contain similar loops involving more hops.

   In order to prevent and detect such CI/T loops, each CDN uses a CDN
   Provider ID to uniquely identify itself.  In every CI/T Command it
   originates or cascades, each CDN MUST append an array element
   containing its CDN Provider ID to a JSON array under an entry named
   "cdn-path".  When receiving CI/T Commands a dCDN MUST check the cdn-
   path and reject any CI/T Command which already contains its own CDN
   Provider ID in the cdn-path.  Transit CDNs MUST check the cdn-path
   and not cascade the CI/T Command to dCDNs that are already listed in
   cdn-path.

   The CDN Provider Id consists of the two characters "AS" followed by
   the CDN Provider's Autonomous System number, then a colon (':') and
   an additional qualifier that is used to guarantee uniqueness in case
   a particular AS has multiple independent CDNs deployed.  For example
   "AS64496:0".

   If the CDN provider has multiple Autonomous Systems, the same AS
   number SHOULD be used in all messages from that CDN provider, unless
   there are multiple distinct CDNs.

   If the RI interface described in [I-D.ietf-cdni-redirection] is
   implemented by the dCDN, the CI/T and RI interfaces SHOULD use the
   same CDN Provider Id.

4.7.  Error Handling

   A dCDN can signal rejection of a CI/T Command using HTTP status
   codes.  For example, 400 if the request is malformed, or 403 or 404
   if the uCDN does not have permission to issue CI/T Commands or it is
   trying to act on another CDN's data.





Murray & Niven-Jenkins   Expires January 3, 2016               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   If any part of the CI/T Trigger Command fails, the trigger SHOULD be
   reported as "failed" once its activity is complete or if no further
   errors will be reported.  The "errors" property in the Trigger Status
   Resource will be used to enumerate which actions failed and the
   reasons for failure, and can be present while the Trigger Status
   Resource is still "pending" or "active", if the CI/T Trigger Command
   is still running for some URLs or Patterns in the Trigger
   Specification.

   Once a request has been accepted, processing errors are reported in
   the Trigger Status Resource using a list of Error Descriptions.  Each
   Error Description is used to report errors against one or more of the
   URLs or Patterns in the Trigger Specification.

   If a surrogate affected by a CI/T Trigger Command is offline in the
   dCDN, or the dCDN is unable to pass a CI/T Command on to any of its
   cascaded dCDNs:

   o  If the CI/T Command is abandoned by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD
      report an error.

   o  A CI/T "invalidate" command may be reported as "complete" when
      surrogates that may have the data are offline.  In this case,
      surrogates MUST NOT use the affected data without first
      revalidating it when they are back online.

   o  CI/T "preposition" and "purge" commands can be reported as
      "processed" if affected caches are offline and the activity will
      complete when they return to service.

   o  Otherwise, the dCDN SHOULD keep the Trigger Status Resource in
      state "pending" or "active" until the CI/T Command is acted upon,
      or the uCDN chooses to cancel it.

4.8.  Content URLs

   To refer to content in the dCDN, the uCDN MUST present URLs in the
   same form as in the metadata it supplied to the dCDN.  By definition,
   it is always possible for the dCDN to locate content based on URLs in
   this form.

   Therefore, if content URLs are transformed by an intermediate CDN in
   a cascade, that intermediate CDN MUST transform URLs in CI/T Commands
   it passes to its dCDN.

   When processing Trigger Specifications, CDNs MUST ignore the URL
   scheme (http or https) in comparing URLs.  For example, for a CI/T

   invalidate or purge command, content MUST be invalidated or purged
   regardless of the protocol clients use to request it.

5.  CI/T Object Properties and Encoding

   CI/T Commands, Trigger Status Resources and Trigger Collections and
   their properties are encoded using JSON, as defined in sections
   Section 5.1.1, Section 5.2.1, and Section 5.1.2.

   Names in JSON are case sensitive.  The names and literal values
   specified in the present document MUST always use lower-case.

   JSON types, including 'object', 'array", 'number' and 'string' are
   defined in [RFC7159].

   Unrecognised name/value pairs in JSON objects SHOULD NOT be treated
   as an error by either the uCDN or dCDN.  They SHOULD be ignored in
   the processing, and passed on by dCDN to any further dCDNs in a
   cascade.

5.1.  CI/T Objects

   The top-level objects defined by the CI/T interface are described in
   this section.  Each has an associated MIME Media Type.  The encoding
   of values used by these objects is described in Section 5.2.

5.2.  Properties of CI/T Objects

   This section defines the values that can appear in the top level
   objects described in Section 5.1, and their encodings.

5.2.1.  Trigger Specification

   A Trigger Collection is encoded as a JSON object containing the
   following name/value pairs.

   An unrecognised name/value pair in the Trigger Specification object
   contained in a CI/T Command SHOULD be preserved in the Trigger
   Specification of any Trigger Status Resource it creates.

      Name: type

         Description: This property defines the type of the CI/T Trigger
         Command.

5.2.4.  PatternMatch

   A Pattern Match consists of a string pattern to match, and flags
   describing the type of match.

   It is encoded as a JSON object with the following name/value pairs:

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


      Name: pattern

         Description: A pattern for string matching.

         Value: A JSON string representing the pattern.  The pattern may
         contain the wildcards * and ?, where * matches any sequence of
         characters (including the empty string) and ? matches exactly
         one character.  The three literals "\" , "*" and "?"  MUST be
         escaped as "\\", "\*" and "\?".

         Mandatory: Yes.

      Name: case-sensitive

         Description: Flag indicating whether or not case-sensitive
         matching should be used.

         Value: One of the JSON values 'true' or 'false'.

         Mandatory: No, default is case-insensitive match.

      Name: match-query-string

         Description: Flag indicating whether or not the query string
         should be included in the pattern match.

         Value: One of the JSON values 'true' or 'false'.

         Mandatory: No, default is not to include the query string in
         the pattern match.

   Example of case-sensitive prefix match against
   "http://www.example.com/trailers/":

   {
       "pattern": "http://www.example.com/trailers/*",
       "case-sensitive": true
   }

5.2.5.  Absolute Time

   A JSON number, seconds since the UNIX epoch.

5.2.6.  Error Description

   An Error Description is used to report failure of a CI/T Command, or
   in the activity it triggered.  It is encoded as a JSON object with
   the following name/value pairs:

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


      Name: error

         Value: Error Code, as defined in Section 5.2.7.

         Mandatory: Yes.

      Names: metadata.urls, content.urls, metadata.patterns,
      content.patterns

         Description: Metadata and content references copied from the
         Trigger Specification.  Only those URLs and patterns to which
         the error applies are included in each property, but those URLs
         and patterns MUST be exactly as they appear in the request, the
         dCDN MUST NOT generalise the URLs.  (For example, if the uCDN
         requests prepositioning of URLs "http://content.example.com/a"
         and "http://content.example.com/b", the dCDN must not
         generalise its error report to Pattern
         "http://content.example.com/*".)

         Value: A JSON array of JSON strings, where each string is
         copied from a 'content.*' or 'metadata.*' value in the
         corresponding Trigger Specification.

         Mandatory: At least one of these name/value pairs is mandatory
         in each Error Description object.

      Name: description

         Description: A human-readable description of the error.

         Value: A JSON string, the human-readable description.

         Mandatory: No.

5.2.7.  Error Code

   This type is used by the dCDN to report failures in trigger
   processing.

6.  Examples

   The following sections provide examples of different CI/T objects
   encoded as JSON.

   Discovery of the triggers interface is out of scope of this document.
   In an implementation, all CI/T URLs are under the control of the
   dCDN.  The uCDN MUST NOT attempt to ascribe any meaning to individual
   elements of the path.

   In examples in this section, the URL 'http://dcdn.example.com/
   triggers' is used as the location of the collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources, and the CDN Provider Id of uCDN is "AS64496:1".

6.1.  Creating Triggers

   Examples of the uCDN triggering activity in the dCDN:

6.1.1.  Preposition

   An example of a CI/T preposition command, a POST to the collection of
   all Trigger Status Resources.

   Note that "metadata.patterns" and "content.patterns" are not allowed
   in a preposition Trigger Specification.

   REQUEST:

     POST /triggers HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*
     Content-Type: application/cdni.ci.TriggerCommand+json
     Content-Length: 347

     {
       "trigger" : {
         "type": "preposition",

         "metadata.urls" : [ "http://metadata.example.com/a/b/c" ],
         "content.urls" : [
             "http://www.example.com/a/b/c/1",
             "http://www.example.com/a/b/c/2",
             "http://www.example.com/a/b/c/3",
             "http://www.example.com/a/b/c/4"
           ]
       },
       "cdn-path" : [ "AS64496:1" ]

         }
     }

6.1.2.  Invalidate

   An example of a CI/T invalidate command, another POST to the
   collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  This instructs the dCDN
   to re-validate the content at "http://www.example.com/a/index.html",
   as well as any metadata and content whose URLs are prefixed by
   "http://metadata.example.com/a/b/" using case-insensitive matching,
   and "http://www.example.com/a/b/" respectively, using case-sensitive
   matching.

     }

6.2.  Examining Trigger Status

   Once Trigger Status Resources have been created, the uCDN can check
   their status as shown in these examples.

6.2.1.  Collection of All Triggers

   The uCDN can fetch the collection of all Trigger Status Resources it
   has created that have not yet been deleted or removed as expired.
   After creation of the "preposition" and "invalidate" triggers shown
   above, this collection might look as follows:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*


   RESPONSE:

         "coll-complete": "/triggers/complete",
         "coll-failed": "/triggers/failed",
         "coll-pending": "/triggers/pending",
         "staleresourcetime": 86400,
         "triggers": [
             "http://dcdn.example.com/triggers/0",
             "http://dcdn.example.com/triggers/1"
         ]
     }

6.2.2.  Filtered Collections of Trigger Status Resources

   The filtered collections are also available to the uCDN.  Before the
   dCDN starts processing the two CI/T Trigger Commands shown above,
   both will appear in the collection of Pending Triggers, for example:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/pending HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*


   RESPONSE:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Length: 153
     Expires: Sun, 31 Aug 2014 09:54:19 GMT
     Server: example-server/0.1
     Etag: "5012053611544832286"
     Cache-Control: max-age=60
     Date: Sun, 31 Aug 2014 09:53:19 GMT
     Content-Type: application/cdni.ci.TriggerCollection+json

     {
         "staleresourcetime": 86400,
         "triggers": [
             "http://dcdn.example.com/triggers/0",
             "http://dcdn.example.com/triggers/1"
         ]
     }

   At this point, if no other Trigger Status Resources had been created,
   the other filtered views would be empty.  For example:

6.2.3.  Individual Trigger Status Resources

   The Trigger Status Resources can also be examined for detail about
   individual CI/T Trigger Commands.  For example, for the CI/T
   "preposition" and "invalidate" commands from previous examples:

   The uCDN SHOULD use the Entity Tags of collections or Trigger Status
   Resources when polling for change in status, as shown in the
   following examples:

   When the CI/T Trigger Command is complete, the contents of the
   filtered collections will be updated along with their Entity Tags.
   For example, when the two example CI/T Trigger Commands are complete,
   the collections of pending and complete Trigger Status Resources
   might look like:

6.2.5.  Deleting Trigger Status Resources

   reduce the size of the collections.  For example, to delete the
   "preposition" request from earlier examples:

8.  Security Considerations

   The CI/T interface provides a mechanism to allow a uCDN to generate
   requests into the dCDN and to inspect its own CI/T requests and their
   current state.  The CI/T interface does not allow access to or
   modification of the uCDN or dCDN metadata relating to content
   delivery, or to the content itself.  It can only control the presence
   of that metadata in the dCDN, and the processing work and network
   utilisation involved in ensuring that presence.

   By examining pre-positioning requests to a dCDN, and correctly
   interpreting content and metadata URLs, an attacker could learn the
   uCDN or content owner's predictions for future content popularity.
   By examining invalidate or purge requests, an attacker could learn
   about changes in the content owner's catalogue.

   By injecting CI/T commands an attacker, or a misbehaving uCDN, would
   generate work in the dCDN and uCDN as they process those requests.
   And so would a man in the middle attacker modifying valid CI/T
   commands generated by the uCDN.  In both cases, that would decrease
   the dCDN caching efficiency by causing it to unnecessarily acquire or
   re-acquire content metadata and/or content.

   A dCDN implementation of CI/T MUST restrict the actions of a uCDN to
   the data corresponding to that uCDN.  Failure to do so would allow
   uCDNs to detrimentally affect each other's efficiency by generating
   unnecessary acquisition or re-acquisition load.

8.1.  Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Integrity
      Protection

   A CI/T implementation MUST support TLS transport for HTTP (https) as
   per [RFC2818] and [RFC7230].

   The use of TLS for transport of the CI/T interface allows:

   o  The dCDN and the uCDN to authenticate each other and, once they
      have mutually authenticated each other, it allows:

   o  The dCDN and the uCDN to authorize each other (to ensure they are
      receiving CI/T Commands from, or reporting status to, an
      authorized CDN).

   o  CDNI commands and responses to be transmitted with
      confidentiality.



Murray & Niven-Jenkins   Expires January 3, 2016               [Page 42]

Internet-Draft          CDN Interconnect Triggers              July 2015


   o  Protection of the integrity of CDNI commands and responses.

   In an environment where any such protection is required, mutually
   authenticated encrypted transport MUST be used to ensure
   confidentiality of the CI/T information.  To that end, TLS MUST be
   used by CI/T, including authentication of the remote end.

   When TLS is used, the general TLS usage guidance in [RFC7525] MUST be
   followed.

   HTTP requests that attempt to access or operate on CI/T data
   belonging to another CDN MUST be rejected using, for example, HTTP
   "403 Forbidden" or "404 Not Found".  This is intended to prevent
   unauthorised users from generating unnecessary load in dCDN or uCDN
   due to revalidation, reacquisition, or unnecessary acquisition.

   Note that in a "diamond" configuration, where one uCDN's content can
   be acquired via more than one directly-connected uCDN, it may not be
   possible for the dCDN to determine from which uCDN it acquired
   content.  In this case, the dCDN MUST allow each uCDN from which the
   content could have been acquired to act upon that content using CI/T
   Commands.

8.2.  Denial of Service

   This document does not define a specific mechanism to protect against
   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the CI/T.  However, CI/T endpoints
   can be protected against DoS attacks through the use of TLS transport
   and/or via mechanisms outside the scope of the CI/T interface, such
   as firewalling or use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

   Depending on the implementation, triggered activity may consume
   significant processing and bandwidth in the dCDN.  A malicious or
   faulty uCDN could use this to generate unnecessary load in the dCDN.
   The dCDN should consider mechanisms to avoid overload, for example by
   rate-limiting acceptance or processing of CI/T Commands, or batching
   up its processing.

8.3.  Privacy

   The CI/T protocol does not carry any information about individual End
   Users of a CDN, there are no privacy concerns for End Users.

   The CI/T protocol does carry information which could be considered
   commercially sensitive by CDN operators and content owners.  The use
   of mutually authenticated TLS to establish a secure session for the
   transport of CI/T data, as discussed in Section 8.1, provides
   confidentiality while the CI/T data is in transit, and prevents

   parties other party than the authorised dCDN from gaining access to
   that data.  The dCDN MUST ensure that it only exposes CI/T data
   related to a uCDN to clients it has authenticated as belonging to
   that uCDN.
