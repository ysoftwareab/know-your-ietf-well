1. Introduction 

   The SatLabs Group [SATLABS] is an international non-profit EEIG 
   (European Economic Interest Grouping) committed to large-scale 
   adoption and deployment of the Digital Video Broadcasting Return 
   Channel via Satellite (DVB-RCS) standard [ETSI-RCS]. SatLabs members 
   are service providers, satellite operators, system integrators, 
   terminal manufacturers and technology providers with an interest in 
   DVB-RCS. 

   Since its creation in 2001, the main goal of the SatLabs Group has 
   been to achieve interoperability between DVB-RCS terminals and 
   systems. Therefore, the Group has defined the SatLabs Qualification 
   Program which provides an independent certification process for DVB-
   RCS Terminals based on System Recommendations defined by SatLabs. To 
   enhance products interoperability, beyond the physical and MAC layers 
   mechanisms defined in the DVB-RCS standard, SatLabs has expanded its 
   Recommendations in the field of DVB-RCS terminal management 
   [SATLABS]. As a part of this effort, SatLabs has specified a common 
   SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) for DVB-RCS terminals, which 
   is defined in this document.

2. Conventions used in this document 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT" 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [RFC2119]. 

2.1. MIB Module 

   The MIB module in this document uses the following OBJECT IDENTIFIER values 
   assigned by IANA: 
    
                    +------------+---------------------------+ 
                    | Descriptor | OBJECT IDENTIFIER value   | 
                    +------------+---------------------------+ 
                    |dvbrcsIfMib |{ mib-2 transmission 239 } | 
                    +------------+---------------------------+ 
    
                Table 1: Object Identifiers for the MIB 
    
   These values have been assigned for this MIB under the 'mib-2.transmission' 
   subtree.

4. Security Considerations 

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a 
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments.  

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even 
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even 
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed 
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this 
   MIB module. 

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 

    

5. IANA Considerations 

   No action from IANA is needed.

   Rev -01  

   - Second draft, for comment by the community.  

   The MIB module is renamed DVBRCS-MIB to reflect that it covers more 
   than solely interface issues. 

   The MIB has been updated with 

         o a conformance section that captures the options 

         o structural changes and corrections to achieve this 

         o SYNTAX refinements where applicable 

         o UNITS declarations where applicable 

   Document reformatted to conform to I-D format conventions.
