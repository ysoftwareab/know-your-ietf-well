1. Introduction 
    
   L2VPN signaling protocols described in [L2VPN-SIG] specify the 
   signaling procedures to set up various L2VPN models as defined in 
   [L2VPN-FRAME]. This document describes how BGP can be used to provide 
   an auto-discovery mechanism for L2VPN membership information that can 
   be used for the signaling procedures. The L2VPN membership consists 
   of identifiers of the Forwarders, the network address of the PE where 
   the Forwarders are provisioned, the VPN Identifier that the 
   Forwarders belong to, and other necessary information. This 
   information is encoded and distributed to other PEs through BGP 
   update messages. 
    
2. Auto-Discovery Overview 
    
   [BGP-AUTO] describes the general framework of using BGP for auto-
   discovery of both L2VPNs and L3VPNs, which is done through the 
   process of distributing a database of VPN membership on per PE basis. 
   The auto-discovery mechanism specified in this document is built on 
 
 
hlmu                    Expires - August 2004                [Page 2] 
                    BGP Auto-Discovery for L2VPNs       February 2004 
 
 
   such a framework, and the VPN membership information obtained through 
   this mechanism can be used by L2VPN signaling protocols, such as LDP 
   or L2TP. It is assumed that the PEs that participate in the auto-
   discovery process have the capability of using BGP peerings 
   supporting MPBGP and open capability negotiations.  This document 
   builds on the foundation of Routing Distinguisher utilized in L3VPN 
   support of [2547bis]. 
    
   The following diagram shows an example of an L2VPN that uses BGP 
   auto-discovery. Each PE can communicate with one another through BGP 
   sessions that are established either directly between PEs or by the 
   way of route reflectors. The BGP sessions are used to advertise L2VPN 
   membership information among the PEs. Once PEs learn such 
   information, they can establish L2VPN signaling connections and 
   pseudowires accordingly.

   [L2VPN-SIG] defines that each Forwarder is represented by a Forwarder 
   Identifier which is the concatenation of an Attachment Group 
   Identifier (AGI) and an Attachment Individual Identifier (AII). 
    
   To advertise a Forwarder, the AGI and AII are encoded in BGP MP-NLRI 
   fields and distributed to PEs participating in L2VPN auto-discovery. 
   All Forwarders belonging to the same L2VPN will have the same AGI. 
   When a PE receives a Forwarder advertisement through BGP, it uses the 
   AII encoded in the advertisement as the Target AII (TAII) for the 
   L2VPN signaling protocol. The Source AII (SAII) of the local 
   Forwarder is known through local configuration on the PE. When a

   Forwarder previously advertised is removed from a PE, the PE needs to 
   withdraw the AGI and AII of this Forwarder. 
    
3. BGP Protocol Details 
 

3.1 Overview  
    
   The BGP auto-discovery specified in this document is similar to the 
   schemes described [BGPVPN] and [LDPVPN], but further optimized. This 
   introduction provides the background on these mechanisms.    
    
   The L2VPN mechanisms have been designed to support both VPWS and VPLS 
   (normal and GVPLS). The mechanisms have been optimized to support the 
   rapid growth of either VPWS or VPLS usage.   
    
   The BGP multi-protocol attribute has the following fields [MPBGP]: 
    
      [AFI] [SAFI] [length of next hop] [next hop address] [number of 
      SNPAs] [length of SNPA1] [SNPA1][length of SNPA2] [SNPA2] ... 
      [length of SNPAn] [SNPAn] 
    
   BGP auto-discovery makes use of the coloring of routes in BGP and the 
   attachment of next hop addresses to a particular sub-network point of 
   attachment (SNPA) in the multi-protocol attribute. 
    
   The coloring of routes passed in the BGP protocol can be done by 
   associating either a BGP Community (normal [BGPCOMM] or extended 
   [BGPEXTCOMM]), and or extended information in the multi-protocol 
   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).  In L3VPNs [2547bis], 
   the coloring is done via a: 
         - Route Target as an Extended Community attribute, and 
         - an AFI/SAFI pair that allows the NLRI to be encoded as  
            12 bytes with 8 byte Route Distinguisher and a 4 byte IP v4 
            address.   
         
   The encoding of the AFI/SAFI alerts the L3VPNs that this AFI/SAFI 
   pair is used for L3VPNs. 
    
   As the deployment of the L3VPNs has increased, the fate sharing of 
   multiple BGP VPNs over a single TCP connection has caused problems in 
   some BGP deployments. In response to these problems, new BGP work 
   items are being proposed [IETF57, IDR notes] for reducing the fate 
   sharing of the VPNs. These proposed BGP mechanisms include: restarts 
   limited to a AFI-SAFI pair [nalawade-soft-notify], route-refresh 
   limited to a AFI-SAFI pair [BGPREFRESH], bundling of AFI/SAFIs over a 
   TCP connection [BGP-BUNDLE-TCP]. While proposed BGP mechanisms are 
   under consideration of the IDR group and have some deployment, these 
   items have not been approved as BGP drafts.   
    
 
 
hlmu                    Expires - August 2004                [Page 4] 
                    BGP Auto-Discovery for L2VPNs       February 2004 
 
 
   These mechanisms can also reduce the fate-sharing of auto-discovery 
   mechanisms for different L2VPNS.  If explosive growth occurs in 
   either the VPWS or VPLS deployments, utilizing these AFI/SAFI 
   isolation mechanisms may allow splitting of the processing of auto-
   discovery mechanisms. 
    
3.2 AFI/SAFI encoding  
      
   
   The AFI value will be XXXX (assigned by IANA) is used for all L2VPN 
   applications. The SAFI value will be set the following bit pattern:  
    
            0000 00LW  -- where 
                           L is the presence of VPLS 
                           W is the presence of VPWS 
    
   Initial deployments are expected to have both VPLS and VPWS within an 
   L2VPN, and the SAFI value is set 3 to signify that the NRLI encoding 
   can be used for both VPLS and Future deployments that expect either 
   VPWS or VPLS but not both in an L2VPN may set the SAFI value in the 
   AFI/SAFI encoding to 1 for VPWS or 2 for VPLS. 
    
3.3 NLRI Encodings 
    

   The encoding of the NRLI in the MP-BGP attribute is based on the 
   AFI/SAFI identifiers.  For L2VPNs, the SAFI values of 1-3 will have 
   the following NLRI encoding: 
    
      Length of NLRI in bits, NLRI field (variable length)  
    
         Where the NLRI field is further defined as: 
 
         Length of AGI (in bits), AGI (variable), 
         Length of AII (in bits), AII (variable)   
 
 
3.4 Use of RD format for AGI 
    

   The AGI is defined by [L2VPN-SIG].  For initial deployments, the AGI 
   may utilize the Route Distinguisher as defined by RFC 2547.  This 
   section describes the appropriate use of the values of the Route 
   Distinguisher for the AGI.  This text is non-normative, that is it 
   provides suggestions for deployment, but does not constitute any 
   requirements on the specification. 
    
   The RD is encoded as follows:  
    
      [type (2 octets)] [value (6 octets)]

   For deployment details on the RD, please refer to the section 6 on 
   deployment.  
       
3.5 Capabilities Negotiation for L2VPN Auto-Discovery 
    
   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange L2VPN NLRI, they MUST use 
   negotiation scheme defined in [MPBGP-RFC 2842] to ensure both of them 
   capable of processing such NLRI correctly. Two BGP speakers 
   exchanging L2VPN NLRI service MAY use the dynamic capabilities 
   negotiation scheme defined utilizing the new capabilities message 
   [BGP-DYNCAP]. 
    
   With either negotiation, the peer will specify the Multi-protocol 
   Extensions (capability 1) including in the capability list the 
   AFI/SAFI pairs for L2VPNs.  As example, a BGP peer could announce in 
   the capability could specific AFI(XXX)/SAFI(1), AFI(XXX)/SAFI(2), 
   AFI/SAFI(3). 
 
3.6 Use of RT for Auto-Discovery 
    
   
   If a Layer 2 Forwarder wishes to be discovered via BGP, it needs to 
   be provisioned with a Forwarder Identifier that consists of an AGI 
   and an AII and associate the Forwarder Identifier with one or more 
   Route Targets (RT) Extended Community attributes. The RT Extended 
   Community attributes are passed along with the BGP route. 
    
3.7 Use of RT for Controlling Traffic 
    
   
   The RTs are utilized in BGP to control NLRI distribution. Each BGP 
   speaker can define a set of distribution policies using Route Targets 
   to control how addresses are advertised or accepted, thereby 
   governing the formation of the L2VPN network topology.  
    
   To form a full mesh, each Forwarder is configured with the same RT 
   value for both the "export RT" and the "import RT".  This 
   distribution policy allows the Forwarders to be visible to all BGP 
   speakers having the same Route Target (Extended Community value).  
   After the all BGP peers have the Layer-2 information, they can set up 
   a full mesh of pseudowires among these Forwarders using the L2VPN 
   signaling procedures. (Note: Other BGP policy may not utilize Route 
   Targets and fully distribute the L2VPN information to all BGP 
   speakers within the full mesh.The key is the full distribution of 
   Layer-2 endpoints to the BGP speakers setting up the full mesh.) 
    
   Sometimes, a hub-and-spoke L2PVN network is desired. This can be 
   achieved by using two different RTs for distribution processing, 
   where one stands for "hub" and the other stands for "spoke". On the 
   hub PE, the "hub" RT is assigned to local Forwarders as the "export 
   RT", and the hub PE is configured to "import" only the L2VPN NLRIs 
 
 
hlmu                    Expires - August 2004                [Page 6] 
                    BGP Auto-Discovery for L2VPNs       February 2004 
 
 
   that have the "spoke" RT. On the spoke PE, the "spoke" RT is assigned 
   to the local Forwarders as the "export RT", and the spoke PE is 
   configured to "import" only the L2VPN NLRIs that have the "hub" RT.  
   This distribution policy will result in (1) spoke PEs only seeing the 
   Forwarders configured on the hub PE, and (2) a hub PE seeing all 
   Forwarders configured on every spoke PE. The L2PVN signaling then 
   sets up pseudo-wires that form the hub-and-spoke topology.   
    
   A more complex topology is partial mesh.  It can be done by using 
   sets of "import RTs" and "export RTs" to control route distributions. 
    
4. Inter-AS Auto-Discovery 
    
   
   When PEs participating in L2VPNs reside in more than one AS, the BGP 
   auto-discovery procedures need to ensure that VPN membership 
   information can be communicated across AS boundaries. Depending on 
   how Forwarders on the PEs are connected in Inter-AS L2VPNs, ABSRs 
   operate in different modes which follow different procedures for 
   L2VPN auto-discovery [L2VPN-SIG]. 
 
                  PE-1 ----+              +---- PE-3 
                           |              | 
                           |              | 
                        ASBR-1 ------- ASBR-2 
                           |              | 
                           |              | 
                  PE-2 ----+              +---- PE-4 
    
                |<-- AS1 -->|            |<-- AS2 -->| 
    
     
4.1 Proxy Mode 
    

   Some network operators want to enforce certain policies including 
   those of L2VPNs at the AS boundaries, and they want L2VPN signaling 
   connections and pseudowires to be confined within an AS. In this mode 
   of operation, an ASBR acts as a ‘‘Proxy’’ PE that establishes and 
   manages signaling connections and pseudowires to the PEs in its own 
   AS on behalf of the PEs in another AS. 
    
   To connect two Forwarders on PE-1 and PE-3 respectively for instance, 
   three pseudowires need to be established and spliced together: one 
   from PE-1 to ASBR-1, one from ASBR-1 to ASBR-2, and one from ASBR-2 
   to PE-3. 
    
   Prior to establishing the pseudowires, PE-1 announces its Forwarder 
   information through a BGP update message. When receiving the BGP 
   update, ASBR-1 replaces the next-hop address with its own address so 
   that the recipient of the update thinks that ASBR-1 is provisioned 
 
 
hlmu                    Expires - August 2004                [Page 7] 
                    BGP Auto-Discovery for L2VPNs       February 2004 
 
 
   with the Forwarder being advertised. In order to keep track of the 
   originating PE, the BGP Identifier of PE-1 is recorded in the first 
   SNAP field. ASBR-1 then announces the update to ASBR-2 with: 
      - next-hop address of ASBR-1, and 
      - SNAP1 filled with PE-1 BGP Identifier. 
    
   When ASBR-2 receives the update from ASBR-1, it performs the same 
   procedures as ASBR-1, so it announces the update to all PEs in AS2 
   with: 
      - next-hop address of ASBR-2, and 
      - SNAP1 with PE1 BGP Identifier, and 
      - SNAP2 with ASBR-1 BGP Identifier. 
    
   From the perspective of PE-3, the remote Forwarder advertised through 
   the update message is provisioned on ASBR-2, so PE-3 needs to set up 
   a pseudowire to ASBR-2 in order to connect to the remote Forwarder. 
    
4.2 Transparent Mode 
    
   
   In this mode, L2VPN signaling connections and pseudowires traverse 
   the AS boundaries and are directly established between the PEs on 
   which Forwarders are provisioned. That is, ASBRs treat pseudowires 
   transparently and do not keep any stateful information of 
   pseudowires. 
    
   This deployment would most often be deployed within an enterprise or 
   carrier where the AS boundaries group information but do not provide 
   a hard boundary to the L2VPNs.   
    
   The ASBRs that deal with the AS confederations that replaced an IBGP 
   mesh may be a candidate to utilize the transparent mode.  It is key 
   for the deployment and management issues to understand that the ASBRs 
   that do not support L2VPN auto-discovery and are included in the 
   transparent mode: 
      -  must pass the information transparently through the router  
         without modification. 
      -  will not keep any information about the state of the pseudo- 
         wires.  
    
   The ASBR that transparently pass the information can either: 
      1) support the L2VPN AFI/SAFI but be configured not 
         to participate in the L2VPN signaling procedures, or 
    
      2) be configured to transitive MP-BGP attributes without 
         processing any MP-BGP attributes. 
    
   For example, When receiving BGP updates that contain L2VPN NLRIs from 
   PEs in AS1, ASBR-1 simply relays them to the neighboring ASBR-2 which 
   further relays them to PEs in AS2 without modification.

   Besides passing the NLRIs, the transparent ASBRs also need to provide 
   Inter-AS network reachability for the PEs so that they can establish 
   L2VPN signaling connections and pseudowires to each other. 
 
   Entities utilizing the transparent mode must be careful to consider 
   all BGP issues, L2VPN signaling and policy issues.  L3VPN also 
   utilizes this transparent mode of operation [2547bis]. 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
 

   For the BGP sessions used for L2VPN auto-discovery, TCP MD5 
   authentication can be utilized.  The L2VPN signaling protocols may 
   also use its native authentication mechanisms for security. For 
   example, LDP has TCP MD5 authentication as well, and L2TP has a CHAP-
   like authentication scheme. 
    
6. Deployment Issues  
    
   
   The deployment of L2VPN BGP auto-discovery in Enterprises, ISPs and 
   carrier networks uses the mechanisms described in this document will 
   also need to make some deployments decisions.  This section provides 
   some background on deployment issues gained from BGP and L3VPNs. 
   These deployment issues are: 
     1. regarding RD value selection,  
     2. auto-configuration mechanisms for BGP and Signaling protocol 
        setup. 
    
   This section is non-normative, that is it is not binding on an 
   implementation.   
    
6.1 RD Value Selection 
    
   
   L2VPN auto-configurations are being deployed to ease the 
   configuration burden of L2VPNs over MPLS.  In choosing an RD, it is 
   important to understand the issues between the three existing types 
   of RD values.  For ease of transition between type 0-2 RD values, it 
   may be useful to restrict the assigned number to 2 bytes.  
    
   The following is the definition of the RD bytes from [BGP2547bis]: 
     
   [type (2 octets)]  
   [Value (6 octets)] 
      type 0: [Administrator (2 octets), Assigned number (4 octets)]  
      type 1: [Administrator (4 octets), Assigned number (2 octets)] 
      type 2: [Administrator (4 octets), Assigned number (2 octets)]

                    BGP Auto-Discovery for L2VPNs       February 2004 
 
 
   A type 0 RD Administrator filed has two octets for an Administrator 
   value (2 bytes) that is drawn from the public autonomous system (AS) 
   number space combined with a 4 byte assigned number. Today, the AS 
   numbers fit within 2 bytes.  Within 3-7 years, the AS numbers may 
   exceed the 2 byte space, and require the 4 byte AS numbers. It would 
   be wise to only use the 2 bytes of Assigned number for type 0 and 
   type 2 assigned numbers.  Type 1 uses an assigned IP address [4 
   bytes] as the administrator identifier.  This address in the type 1 
   RD administrator field should utilize. 
    
   The type 1 RD administrator field an IP address is from the public IP 
   address space.  Private address numbers used for administrator 
   numbers should not be used in RDs. Use of private address numbers 
   (such as network 10) may run into collisions with two network 
   deployments using the same IP address.  
 
6.2 Dynamic Signaling Session Creation 
    

   The purpose of BGP auto-configuration is to reduce the configuration 
   burden for setup of psuedowires.  In deployment of the BGP auto-
   discovery just as in the normal BGP, the policy controlling the auto-
   configuration uses configuration plus the existence of the 
   information in BGP as the impetus to establish a signaling session.   
    
   Signaling sessions MAY be established before or after the BGP auto-
   discovery phase is completed.  This can be done in two ways:  
     1. Each PE can have a signaling session manually created to all the 
        PEs participating in L2VPN in the network before the BGP auto-
        discovery, regardless of whether they have any forwarders in 
        common or not OR 
     2. Each PE can set up a session to other PEs dynamically as the BGP 
        auto-discovery phase progresses if they have at least one 
        forwarder in common after the auto-discovery phase is complete. 
    
   Approach (1) has the benefit of simplicity and pre-determined 
   behavior in that the L2VPN signaling sessions may not go up and down 
   depending on dynamic L2VPN memberships. 
 
   Approach (2) provides complete automatic creation of signaling 
   sessions based on the BGP auto-discovery mechanisms and local policy. 
   The benefit of this approach is that reduces the configuration burden 
   to a minimum. Once obtain L2VPN membership information through BGP 
   auto-discovery, a PE may start L2VPN signaling sessions to other PEs. 
    
   With either approach, whenever a new Forwarder is added to an L2VPN, 
   a PE MUST advertise its information to all other PEs through BGP. The 
   receiving PE may initiate a pseudowire to the advertising PE with the 
   information learnt through BGP auto-discovery. Whenever an existing 
   Forwarder is removed from an L2VPN, a PE MUST withdraw the previous

   advertisement of this Forwarder through BGP. PEs with pseudowires 
   connecting to this Forwarder will also receive an update through the 
   signaling sessions notifying that the Forwarder is removed. 
    
   Either approach may be chosen for deployment depending on given 
   deployment requirements.
