            Separating Crypto Negotiation and Communication
                  draft-kuehlewind-taps-crypto-sep-01

Abstract

   Secure transport protocols often consist of three logically distinct
   components: transport, control (handshake), and record protection.
   Typically, such a protocol contains a single module that is
   responsible for all three functions.  However, in many cases, this
   coupling is unnecessary.  For example, while cryptographic context
   and endpoint capabilities need to be known before encrypted
   application data can be sent on a specific transport connection,
   there is otherwise no technical constraint that a cryptographic
   handshake must be performed on said connection.  This document
   recommends a logical separation between transport, control, and
   record components of secure transport protocols.  We compare existing
   protocols such as Transport Layer Security, QUIC, and IKEv2+ESP in
   the context of this logical separation.

1.  Introduction

   Secure transport protocols are generally composed of three pieces:

   1.  A transport protocol to handle the transfer of data.

   2.  A record protocol to frame, encrypt and/or authenticate data

   3.  A control protocol to perform cryptographic handshakes, negotiate
       shared secrets, and maintain state during the lifetime of
       cryptographic session including session resumption and key
       refreshment.  (In the context of TLS, the control protocol is
       called the handshake protocol.)

   For ease of deployment and standardization, among other reasons,
   these constituents are often tightly coupled.  For example, in TLS
   [RFC5246], the control protocol depends on the record protocol, and
   vice versa.  However, more recent transport protocols such as QUIC
   [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] keep these pieces separate.  For example, QUIC
   uses TLS to negotiate secrets, and exports those secrets to encrypt
   packets independent of TLS.

   Separating these pieces is important, as new secure transport
   protocols increasingly rely on session resumption mechanisms where
   cryptographic context can be resumed to transmit application data
   with the first packet without delay for connection setup and
   negotiation.  In the case where there is no cryptographic context
   available when an application expresses the need to transmit data to
   a certain endpoint, it must first run the control protocol on a
   transport connection before being able to transmit application data.
   If the control protocol can be separated from the other components,
   then it can use another transport connection to establish secrets
   without blocking the application's main transport connection.  This
   also opens up the possibility to run the control protocol well in
   advance of the need to send application data, to avoid unnecessary
   delays.  For example, a client system could maintain a database of
   endpoints it is likely to communicate with, and establish keying
   material with a control protocol at periodic intervals to ensure
   fresh keys for new transport connections.

   [I-D.moskowitz-sse] proposes a similar approach.  However while
   [I-D.moskowitz-sse] proposes a new protocol to negotiate and maintain
   long-term cryptographic sessions, this document relies on the use of
   existing protocols and only discusses requirements for the evolution
   of these protocols and exchange of information within one endpoint
   locally.

2.  Terminology

   o  Transport Protocol: A protocol that can transport messages between
      two endpoints.  This may represent the service offered to
      applications to allow them to send and receive data before
      encryption; and also represent the protocol that can transmit
      control data and encrypted records.

   o  Control Protocol: A protocol that performs a cryptographic
      handshake and, in addition, can validate and authenticate
      endpoints, encrypt and authenticate its negotiation, and
      ultimately generate keying material.

Internet-Draft              crypto separation               October 2017


   o  Record Protocol: A protocol that can use keying material to
      transform messages.  A record will generally add a frame around
      application data, and authenticate and/or encrypt the data.

   o  Keying Material: A shared secret from which pre-shared keys can be
      derived and subsequently used to encrypt and authenticate data,
      generated by a control protocol and used by a record protocol.

3.  Protocol Interfaces

   In traditional models in which the protocols are not separated out
   into the three elements of control, record, and transport protocols,
   there are two basic approaches to the interactions:

   1.  The transport protocol provides data to the security protocol and
       gets back an encrypted version of the data to be sent (control
       and record protocols are combined).

   2.  The security protocol provides keying material to the transport
       protocol, and the transport protocol is responsible for
       encrypting data (transport and record protocols are combined).

   By teasing apart all three portions as separate protocols, there end
   up being six interface points:

      Figure 1: Secure Transport Protocol Components and Interactions

   1.  A transport protocol depends upon a control protocol to establish
       keying material to protect application data being sent through
       the transport.  The main interface it relies upon is starting the

       control channel, or handshake, or ensuring that the material is
       ready.

   2.  A control protocol depends upon a transport protocol in order to
       send and receive negotiation messages with the remote peer.

   3.  A control protocol sends its keying material and cryptographic
       context to the record protocol to use.

   4.  A record protocol may signal state expiration events to a control
       protocol.

   5.  A transport protocol uses a record protocol to send and receive
       application data.

   6.  A record protocol uses a transport protocol to send and receive
       encrypted data.

3.1.  Control-Transport Interface

   Note that for the purposes of this interface description, it is
   assumed that the application is primarily interacting with the
   transport protocol, and thus the control protocol interacts with the
   application primarily through the abstraction of the transport
   protocol.

   o  Start negotiation: The interface MUST provide an indication to
      start the protocol handshake for key negotiation, and have a way
      to be notified when the handshake is complete.

   o  Identity constraints: The interface MUST allow the application to
      constrain the identities that it will accept a connection to, such
      as the hostname it expects to be provided in certificate SAN.

   o  Local identities: The interface MUST allow the local identity to
      be set via a raw private key or interface to one to perform
      cryptographic operations such as signing and decryption.

   o  State changes: The interface SHOULD provide a way for the
      transport to be notified of important state changes during the
      protocol execution and session lifetime, e.g., when the handshake
      begins, ends, or when a key update occurs.

   o  Validation: The interface MUST provide a way for the application
      to participate in the endpoint authentication and validation,
      which can either be specified as parameters to define how the
      peer's authentication can be validated, or when the protocol

Internet-Draft              crypto separation               October 2017


      provides the authentication information for the application to
      inspect directly.

   o  Caching domain and lifetime: The application SHOULD be able to
      specify the instances of the protocol that can share cached keys,
      as well as the lifetime of cached resources.

   o  The protocol SHOULD allow applications to negotiate application
      protocols and related information.

   o  The protocol SHOULD allow applications to specify negotiable
      cryptographic algorithm suites.

   o  The protocol SHOULD expose the peer's identity information.

3.2.  Control-Record Interface

   o  Key export: The interface MUST provide a way to export keying
      material from a control protocol to a record protocol with well-
      defined cryptographic properties, e.g., "forward-secure."

   o  Key lifetime and rotation: The interface MUST provide a way for
      the control protocol to define key lifetime bounds in terms of
      _time_ or _bytes encrypted_ and, additionally, provide a way to
      forcefully update cryptographic session keys at will.  The record
      protocol MUST be able to signal back to the control protocol that
      a lifetime has been reached and that rotation is required.  These
      values SHOULD be configurable by the application.

3.3.  Transport-Record Interface

   o  Transform data: The interface MUST provide a way to send raw
      application data from the transport protocol to a record protocol
      to transform it based on the keying material.  This data is then
      sent out by the transport protocol.  The same applies for inbound
      data, in which inbound transport data is transformed by the record
      protocol into raw application data.

   o  Reliability: The transport MUST specify if messages are
      transmitted reliable and in order.

   o  Maximum message size (optional): The transport may specify a
      maximum message size for the encrypted data if e.g. a datagram
      transport is used

4.  Existing Mappings

   In this section we document existing mappings between common
   transport security protocols and the three components described in
   Section I.

   o  TLS/DTLS: TLS [RFC5246] and DTLS [RFC6347] is a combination of a
      control (handshake) and record protocol, with a dependency on some
      underlying transport.

                                   +----------------+

   o  QUIC + TLS: The emerging QUIC standard is decomposed into the
      three pieces outlined in Section I [I-D.ietf-quic-tls].  TLS is
      used as the control protocol running on a dedicated QUIC stream, a
      QUIC-specific record protocol encrypts and encapsulates stream
      frames, and the main QUIC component handles the transport of these
      frames.

      already a distinct protocol from its commonly paired record
      protocol, which is ESP [RFC4303].  ESP encrypts and authenticates
      IP datagrams, and sends them as datagrams over a transport
      mechanism such, e.g., IP or UDP.

5.  Benefits of Separation

Internet-Draft              crypto separation               October 2017


5.1.  Reducing Connection Latency

   One of the clearest benefits of separating the control protocol from
   the record protocol is that the cryptographic handshake can be
   performed out-of-band from the application's data transfer.  This
   should essentially reduce the number of RTTs required before being
   able to send data by the full length of the handshake (which is
   commonly 1 or 2 RTTs in the best cases for TLS 1.2 and IKEv2,
   potentially more if cookie challenges or extended authentication are
   required).

   To avoid long-lived transport connections that wouldn't be actively
   used, and thus would be vulnerable to timeouts on NATs or firewalls,
   an obvious approach to separating the control and record protocols is
   to use different transport connections for the early handshake and
   the data transfer.  However, this approach of using separate
   connections will not always save RTTs if the cryptographic handshake
   and data transfer are back-to-back.  Each connection may require its
   own transport protocol handshake, and if the data transfer must wait
   for two transport protocols to establish and the cryptographic
   handshake to be finished before sending, then it may experience
   higher latency.  Implementations SHOULD avoid this by either allowing
   the control and record protocols to share a single transport
   connection or open two connections in parallel when the control
   protocol has not pre-fetched keys.  Latency benefits, however, can
   even be achieved when ensuring that this scenario does not occur by
   always having the control protocol refresh the keys whenever old ones
   are near expiry.

5.2.  Protocol Flexibility

   Separation of the control, record, and transport protocols also
   allows for more flexible composition of protocols with one another.
   If a deployment uses a control protocol like TLS, which requires a
   stream-based transport protocol like TCP, separation of protocols
   will allow it to use the resulting keys for record protocols that run
   on datagram transport protocols like UDP.

   This flexibility may be useful for implementations that are
   optimizing for packet size by choosing minimal/lightweight record
   protocols, while being able to use commonly supported control
   protocols like TLS.  One example here is the approach of a VPN tunnel
   that uses ESP or Diet-ESP [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp] to encrypt
   datagrams, but uses TLS for establishing keys.

Internet-Draft              crypto separation               October 2017


5.3.  Protocol Capability Negotiation

   Enabling the use of a different transport protocol for the actual
   data transmission than for the cryptographic handshakes opens also
   the possibility to negotiate protocol capabilities for the data
   transmission.  For TLS, usually TCP is the appropriate transport
   protocol to use, as it is also widely supported by endpoints.
   Allowing an endpoint to indicate the support of other, new transport
   protocols within the TCP connection that is used for the
   cryptographic handshake, provides a dynamic transition path to enable
   easy deployment of new protocols.
