           Abstract 
     
            This document presents the test specification for SUA(SCCP User  
            Adaptation layer )protocol, which can be used to test SUA  
            implementations for conformance to the protocol definition. The  
            list of tests is exhaustive and covers almost all the categories  
            of test. This draft can also be used in conjunction with SUA  
            specification by implementers of protocol as  implementers guide,  
            as the pictorial representation of various scenarios help easy  
            understanding of the protocol.

    Internet Draft         SUA Conformance Test Plan                Aug 2003 
     
     
     
         1. Introduction 
     
         1.1 Scope 
     
            This document details the Conformance of the SUA( SCCP User  
            Adaptation Layer) Protocol as per <draft-ietf-sigtran-sua-15.txt> 
            The next version of the draft will cover any additions  done to  
            Protocol revision and any subsequent RFC published by IETF. 
     
         1.2 Terms Used 
     
            Signaling Gateway (SG) - Network element that terminates SCN 
            Signaling and transports SCCP-User signaling over IP to an IP 
            Signaling endpoint.  A Signaling Gateway could be modeled as one 
            Or more Signaling Gateway Processes, which are located at the 
            Border of the SS7 and IP networks. Where an SG contains more than 
            one SGP, the SG is a logical entity and the contained SGPs are 
            assumed to be coordinated into a single management view to the SS7 
            network and to the supported Application Servers. 
     
            Application Server (AS) - A logical entity serving a specific 
            Routing Key.  An example of an Application Server is a virtual IP 
            Database element handling all requests for an SCCP-user.  The AS 
            Contains a set of one or more unique Application Server Processes, 
            Of which one or more is normally actively processing traffic. 
     
            Application Server Process (ASP) - An Application Server Process 
            Serves as an active or backup process of an Application Server 
            (e.g., part of a distributed signaling node or database element). 
            Examples of ASPs are MGCs, IP SCPs, or IP-based HLRs. An ASP 
            Contains an SCTP end-point and may be configured to process  
            traffic Within more than one Application Server. 
     
            IP Server Process (IPSP) - A process instance of an IP-based 
            Application.  An IPSP is essentially the same as an ASP, except   
            that It uses SUA in a peer-to-peer fashion.  Conceptually, an IPSP  
            does Not use the services of a Signaling Gateway.

    Internet Draft         SUA Conformance Test Plan                Aug 2003 
     
     
            Signaling Gateway Process (SGP) - A process instance of a 
            Signaling Gateway.  It serves as an active, load-sharing or 
            Broadcast process of a Signaling Gateway. 
     
            Signaling Process - A process instance that uses SUA to   
            communicate With other signaling process.  An ASP, a SGP and an  
            IPSP are all Signaling processes. 
     
     
            Association - An association refers to an SCTP association.  The 
            Association provides the transport for the delivery of SCCP-User 
            Protocol data units and SUA layer peer messages. 
     
            Routing Key - The Routing Key describes a set of SS7 parameters 
            And/or parameter-ranges that uniquely defines the range of 
            Signaling traffic configured to be handled by a particular 
            Application Server. An example would be where a Routing Key  
            consists Of a particular SS7 SCCP SSN plus an identifier to  
            uniquely mark the network that the SSN belongs to, for which all  
            traffic would be Directed to a particular Application Server.   
            Routing Keys are mutually exclusive in the sense that a received  
            SS7 signaling Message cannot be directed to more than one Routing  
            Key.  Routing Keys can be provisioned, for example, by a MIB or  
            registered using SUA's dynamic registration procedures. 
     
            Routing Context - An Application Server Process may be configured  
            to Process traffic within more than one Application Server.  In  
            this Case, the Routing Context parameter is exchanged between the  
            SGP and the ASP (or between two ASPs), identifying the relevant  
            Application Server.  From the perspective of an SGP/ASP, the             
            Routing Context Uniquely identifies the range of traffic  
            associated with a Particular Application Server, which the ASP is  
            configured to receive. There is a 1:1 relationship between a  
            Routing Context values and a Routing Key within an AS.  Therefore  
            the Routing Context can be viewed as an index into an AS Table  
            containing the AS Routing Keys. The Routing Context also uniquely  
            identifies an SS7 entity  (Point code) into a SS7 network, as  
            presented by the SGP. 
     
            Address Mapping Function (AMF) - The AMF is an implementation 
            Dependent function that is responsible for resolving the address 
            Presented in the incoming SCCP/SUA message to correct SCTP 
            Association for the desired endpoint. The AMF MAY use routing 
            Context / rouging key information as selection criteria for the 
            Appropriate SCTP association.

            Fail-over - The capability to re-route signaling traffic as 
            Required to an alternate Application Server Process, or group of 
            ASPs, within an Application Server in the event of failure or 
            Unavailability of a currently used Application Server Process. 
            Fail-over may apply upon the return to service of a previously 
            Unavailable Application Server Process. 
     
            Network Byte Order - Most significant byte first, a.k.a. Big  
            Endian. 
     
            Layer Management - Layer Management is a nodal function that  
            Handles the inputs and outputs between the SUA layer and a local   
            Management Entity. 
     
            Host - The computing platform that the SGP or ASP process is  
            running On. 
     
            Stream - A stream refers to an SCTP stream; a uni-directional 
            Logical channel established from one SCTP endpoint to another 
            Associated SCTP endpoint, within which all user messages are 
            Delivered in-sequence except for those submitted to the un-ordered 
            Delivery service. 
     
            Transport address - an address that serves as a source or 
            Destination for the unreliable packet transport service used by 
            SCTP. In IP networks, a transport address is defined by the 
            Combination of an IP address and an SCTP port number.  Note, only 
            One SCTP port may be defined for each endpoint, but each SCTP 
            Endpoint may have multiple IP addresses. 
     
        2 General Principles of SUA Tests 
     
            These tests aim to verify a given implementation of a protocol in 
            Accordance with the relevant draft. The specification is  
            independent Of a given implementation and does not generally imply  
            any modification of The endpoint under test. However, it is  
            recognized that certain tests Require capabilities of the system  
            that are not explicitly defined in The draft, and these  
            capabilities may not be present in all Implementations. As a  
            consequence, certain tests may  not be possible in  All  
            implementations.

         2.1 Presentation of test descriptions 
     
            Each test description includes the environment in which the   
            implementation  under test must be inserted in order to pass the  
            test. Nine test Configurations are defined (named A, B, C, D, G, H  
            and  I, Relay); they are presented in clause 3. 
            Each test is precisely described. Nevertheless, some events not 
            Directly concerning the point under test, or without direct link  
            With the test nature, are not explicitly described. In order to  
            preserve the  Test description implementation independence,  
            certain flexibility has  been left in the test descriptions. This  
            is particularly the case when it is necessary to terminate the  
            SCTP association (where it is only mentioned, "Terminate" with no  
            more precision). The operator will choose according to the  
            implementation particularities and the events 
            expected  in the test description, the appropriate Termination  
            means (MML- Man Machine Language, provoked failure, etc.). 
     
     
         2.1.1 Pre Test Condition 
     
            Before starting the test we need to get the setup into a condition 
            From where test can be started. These conditions are specified in  
            Pre- Test condition in each test. 
     
            Note: Where NIF has been written, it means that NIF+SM. In some 
            implementation these may be two entities and in some, they may be 
            implemented in single entity. 
     
     
     
        3  Test Configurations: 
         The set of tests described in this Recommendation assumes that the 
         Point under test is inserted in a test environment called "test 
         Configuration".

          REG_RSP message would be received at the ASP side with RC 
          value and a Success Status for REG_RSP. Check that the AS 
          to which ASP has been added has the same configuration as 
          requested in the Dynamic Registration. 
          Check C: Ntfy (AS-inactive) is sent to ASP. 
        3. Send a ASPAC from ASP to SGP for RC1. 
          Check C: A Status Ind for ASP Active for RC1 is received at 
          the NIF(SM). Active-Ack with RC1 is received at ASP and Notify

        4. Send Data for RK1 from SGP. 
          Check D: Data Message is received at the ASP side. 
     
        Note: In some implementations, when Data is sent for an 
        unconfigured RK then instead of giving a Send Failure the Stack 
        may route the Data through  a Default AS .

           Check B: ASP indicates Inactive to SM. 
           The state of AS is Active if the minimum number of ASPs that can be 
           Active in the AS is 1. 
        2. Send a valid DeReg Req message from ASP1 to SGP Stack. 
           Check B: A DEREG_IND would be received at the NIF(SM) and a 
           DEREG_RSP message would be received at the ASP1 side with RC value  
           and a Success Status for DEREG_REQ. Check that ASP1 is removed from 
           the AS.
