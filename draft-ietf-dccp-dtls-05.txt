   Abstract

   This document specifies the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) over the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DTLS
   provides communications privacy for datagram protocols and allows
   client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed
   to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.  DCCP is a
   transport protocol that provides a congestion-controlled unreliable
   datagram service.

INTERNET-DRAFT              DTLS over DCCP            February 6, 2008




1. Introduction

   This document specifies how to use Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS), as specified in [RFC4347], over the Datagram Congestion
   Control Protocol (DCCP), as specified in [RFC4340].

   DTLS is an extension of Transport Layer Security (TLS, [RFC4346])
   that modifies TLS for use with the unreliable transport protocol UDP.
   TLS is a protocol that allows client/server applications to
   communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
   tampering and message forgery.  DTLS can be viewed as TLS-plus-
   adaptations-for-unreliability.

   DCCP provides an unreliable transport service, similar to UDP, but
   with adaptive congestion control, similar to TCP and SCTP.  DCCP can
   be viewed equally well as either UDP-plus-congestion-control or TCP-
   minus-reliability (although, unlike TCP, DCCP offers multiple
   congestion control algorithms).

   The combination of DTLS and DCCP will offer transport security
   capabilities to DCCP users similar to those available for TCP, UDP
   and SCTP.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. DTLS over DCCP

   The approach here is very straightforward -- DTLS records are
   transmitted in the Application Data fields of DCCP-Data and DCCP-
   DataAck packets (in the rest of the document assume that "DCCP-Data
   packet" means "DCCP-Data or DCCP-DataAck packet").  Multiple DTLS
   records MAY be sent in one DCCP-Data packet, as long as the resulting
   packet is within the Path Maximum Transfer Unit (PMTU) currently in
   force for normal data packets, if the Don't Fragment (DF) bit is
   being used, or within the current DCCP maximum packet size if the DF
   bit is not being used (see section 3.5 for more information on PMTU
   Discovery).  A single DTLS record MUST be fully contained in a single
   DCCP-Data packet; it MUST NOT be split over multiple packets.

3.1 DCCP and DTLS Sequence Numbers

   Both DCCP and DTLS use sequence numbers in their packets/records.
   These sequence numbers serve somewhat, but not completely,
   overlapping functions.  Consequently, there is no connection between

   the sequence number of a DCCP packet and the sequence number in a
   DTLS record contained in that packet and no connection between
   sequence number-related features such as DCCP synchronization and
   DTLS anti-replay protection.

3.2 DCCP and DTLS Connection Handshakes

   Unlike UDP, DCCP is connection-oriented, and has a connection
   handshake procedure that precedes the transmission of DCCP-Data and
   DCCP-DataAck packets.  DTLS is also connection-oriented, and has a
   handshake procedure of its own that must precede the transmission of
   actual application information.  Using the rule of mapping DTLS
   records to DCCP-Data and DCCP-DataAck packets in section 3, above,
   the two handshakes are forced to happen in series, with the DCCP
   handshake first, followed by the DTLS handshake.  This is how TLS
   over TCP works.

   However, the DCCP handshake packets DCCP-Request and DCCP-Response
   have Application Data fields and can carry user data during the DCCP
   handshake, and this creates the opportunity to perform the handshakes
   partially in parallel.  DTLS client implementations MAY choose to
   transmit the ClientHello message in the DCCP-Request packet.  DTLS
   server implementations MAY choose to respond to a ClientHello message
   received in a DCCP-Request packet with a HelloVerifyRequest message,
   if denial of service countermeasures are to be used, or a ServerHello
   message otherwise, in the DCCP-Response packet.  DTLS servers MAY
   also choose to delay the response until the handshake completes and
   then send the response in a DCCP-Data packet.

   DTLS handshake messages can be quite large, theoretically up to 2^24-
   1 bytes and in practice often many kilobytes.  Subsequently, unlike
   other DTLS messages, the handshake messages may be fragmented over
   multiple DTLS records.  If the size of the ClientHello is too large
   to transmit in its entirety in a DCCP-Request packet the ClientHello
   MUST be sent in DCCP-Data packets after the DCCP handshake is
   complete.  Similarly, if the server response to a ClientHello is too
   large to transmit in its entirety in a DCCP-Response packet, it MUST
   be sent in DCCP-Data packets after the DCCP handshake is complete.

   Transmission of subsequent DTLS handshake messages MUST wait for the
   completion of the DCCP handshake and use DCCP-Data packets.

   Note that even though the DCCP handshake is a reliable process
   (handshake messages are retransmitted as required if messages are
   lost), the transfer of Application Data in DCCP-Request and DCCP-
   Response packets is not necessarily reliable.  For example, DCCP
   server implementations are free to discard Application Data received
   in DCCP-Request packets.  And if DCCP-Request or DCCP-Response
   packets need to be retransmitted, the DCCP implementation may choose
   to not include the Application Data present in the initial message.

INTERNET-DRAFT              DTLS over DCCP            February 6, 2008

   Since the DTLS handshake is also a reliable process, it will
   interoperate across the data delivery unreliability of DCCP (after
   all, one of the basic functions of DTLS is to work over unreliable
   transport).  If ClientHello messages or the HelloVerifyRequest or
   ServerHello messages are lost, the ClientHello message will be
   retransmitted by DTLS.

   This is regardless of whether the messages were sent in DCCP-
   Response/Request packets or DCCP-Data packets.  However, the only way
   for DTLS to retransmit a ClientHello message that was originally
   transmitted in a DCCP-Request packet (and it or the response was lost
   somehow) is to wait for the DCCP handshake to complete and then send
   the ClientHello in a DCCP-Data packet.  This is due to the
   characteristic of DCCP that the next opportunity to send data after
   sending data in a DCCP-Request is only after the connection handshake
   completes.

   DCCP and DTLS use similar strategies for retransmitting handshake
   messages.  If there is no response to the original request (DCCP-
   Request or ClientHello respectively) within normally 1 second, the
   message is retransmitted.  The timer is then doubled and the process
   repeated until a response is received, or a maximum time is exceeded.

   Therefore, if the ClientHello message is sent in a DCCP-Request
   packet, and the DCCP-Request or DCCP-Response message is lost, the
   DCCP and DTLS handshakes could be timing out on similar schedules.
   The DCCP-Request packets will be retransmitted on timeout, but the
   ClientHello packet cannot be retransmitted until the DCCP handshake
   completes (there is no possibility of adding new Application Data to
   a DCCP-Request retransmission).  In order to avoid multiple
   retransmissions queuing up before the first retransmission can be
   sent, DTLS over DCCP MUST wait until the completion of the DCCP
   handshake before restarting its DTLS handshake retransmission timer.

3.3 Effects of DCCP Congestion Control

   Given the large potential sizes of the DTLS handshake messages, it is
   possible that DCCP congestion control could throttle the transmission
   of the DTLS handshake to the point that the transfer cannot complete
   before the DTLS timeout and retransmission procedures take effect.
   Adding retransmitted messages to a congested situation might only
   make matters worse and delay connection establishment.

   Note that a DTLS over UDP application transmitting handshake data
   into this same network situation will not necessarily receive better
   throughput, and might actually see worse effective throughput.
   Without the pacing of slow-start and congestion control, a UDP
   application might be making congestion worse and lowering the
   effective throughput it receives.

INTERNET-DRAFT              DTLS over DCCP            February 6, 2008

   As stated in [RFC4347], "mishandling of the [retransmission] timer
   can lead to serious congestion problems".  This remains as true for
   DTLS over DCCP as it is for DTLS over UDP.

   DTLS over DCCP implementations SHOULD take steps to avoid
   retransmitting a request that has been queued but not yet actually
   transmitted by DCCP, when the underlying DCCP implementation can
   provide this information.  For example, DTLS could delay starting the
   retransmission timer until DCCP indicates the message has been
   transferred from DCCP to the IP layer.

   In addition to the retransmission issues, if the throughput needs of
   the actual application data differ from the needs of the DTLS
   handshake, it is possible that the handshake transference could leave
   the DCCP congestion control in a state that is not immediately
   suitable for the application data that will follow.  For example,
   DCCP CCID 2 ([RFC4341]) congestion control uses an Additive Increase
   Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm similar to TCP congestion
   control.  If it is used then it is possible that transference of a
   large handshake could cause a multiplicative decrease that would not
   have happened with the application data.  The application might then
   be throttled while waiting for additive increase to return throughput
   to acceptable levels.

   Applications where this might be a problem should consider using DCCP
   CCID 3 ([RFC4342]).  CCID 3 implements TCP-Friendly Rate Control
   (TFRC, [RFC3448])).  TFRC varies the allowed throughput more slowly
   than AIMD and might avoid the discontinuities possible with CCID 2.

3.4 DTLS Sessions and DCCP Connections

   There is no necessary relationship between the life of a DTLS session
   and the life of a DCCP connection.  Often the session and connection
   lives start and stop together (DCCP connection establishment
   immediately followed by DTLS session establishment, DTLS session
   termination immediately followed by DCCP connection termination), but
   this is not the only possibility.

   A single DTLS session may span multiple DCCP connections using the
   DTLS session resumption features.  The session resumption feature of
   DTLS is widely used and this situation is likely to occur frequently.
   It is even possible to resume a DTLS session over a different
   transport.

   DCCP cannot differentiate different types of application data sent
   over a DCCP connection.  If the application performs appropriate
   multiplexing, a DCCP connection could conceivable contain both DTLS
   and non-DTLS data in parallel or series, or several different DTLS
   sessions in series.  However, multiple DTLS sessions cannot be
   carried in parallel over the same DCCP connection since [RFC4347]
   provides no way to demultiplex the different associations.

INTERNET-DRAFT              DTLS over DCCP            February 6, 2008


   A special case of this DCCP connection flexibility is an application
   that starts up transferring non-DTLS data, and then switches to DTLS
   after some time.  This is likely to be useful and has implications
   for the choice of DCCP Service Code.  See section 3.6 for more
   information on this.

3.5 PMTU Discovery

   Each DTLS record must fit within a single DCCP-Data packet.  DCCP
   packets are normally transmitted with the DF (Don't Fragment) bit set
   for IPv4 (or without fragmentation extension headers for IPv6).
   Because of this, DCCP performs Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU)
   Discovery.

   DTLS also normally uses the DF bit and performs PMTU Discovery on its
   own, using an algorithm that is strongly similar to the one used by
   DCCP.  A DTLS over DCCP implementation MAY use the DCCP-managed value
   for PMTU and not perform PMTU Discovery on its own.  However,
   implementations that choose to use the DCCP-managed PMTU value SHOULD
   continue to follow the procedures of [RFC4347] section 4.1.1.1 with
   regard to fragmenting handshake messages during handshake
   retransmissions.  Alternatively, a DTLS over DCCP implementation MAY
   choose to use its own PMTU Discovery calculations, as specified in
   [RFC4347], but MUST NOT use a value greater than the value determined
   by DCCP.

   DTLS implementations normally allow applications to reset the PMTU
   estimate back to the initial state.  When that happens, DTLS over
   DCCP implementations SHOULD also reset the DCCP PMTU estimation.

   DTLS implementations also sometimes allow applications to control the
   use of the DF bit (when running over IPv4) or the use of
   fragmentation extension headers (when running of IPv6).  DTLS over
   DCCP implementations SHOULD control the use of the DF bit or
   fragmentation extension headers by DCCP in concert with the
   application's indications, when the DCCP implementation supports
   this.  Note that DCCP implementations are not required to support
   sending fragmentable packets.

   Note that the DCCP Maximum Packet Size (MPS in [RFC4340]) is bounded
   by the current congestion control state (Congestion Control Maximum
   Packet Size, CCMPS in [RFC4340]).  Even when the DF bit is not set
   and DCCP packets may then be fragmented, the MPS may be less than the
   65,535 bytes normally used in UDP.  It is also possible for the DCCP
   CMPS, and thus the MPS, to vary over time as congestion conditions
   change.  DTLS over DCCP implementations MUST NOT use a DTLS record
   size that is greater than the DCCP MPS currently in force.

3.6 DCCP Service Codes

   The DCCP connection handshake includes a field called Service Code
   that is intended to describe "the application-level service to which
   the client application wants to connect".  Further, "Service Codes
   are intended to provide information about which application protocol
   a connection intends to use, thus aiding middleboxes and reducing
   reliance on globally well-known ports" [RFC4340].

   It is expected that many middleboxes will give different privileges
   to applications running DTLS over DCCP versus just DCCP.  Therefore,
   applications that use DTLS over DCCP sometimes and just DCCP other
   times SHOULD register and use different Service Codes for each mode
   of operation.  Applications that use both DCCP and DTLS over DCCP MAY
   choose to listen for incoming connections on the same DCCP port and
   distinguish the mode of the request by the offered Service Code.

   Some applications may start out using DCCP without DTLS, and then
   optionally switch to using DTLS over the same connection.  Since
   there is no way to change the Service Code for a connection after it
   is established, these applications will use one Service Code.

3.7 New Versions of DTLS

   As DTLS matures, revisions to and updates for [RFC4347] can be
   expected.  DTLS includes mechanisms for identifying the version in
   use and presumably future versions will either include backward
   compatibility modes or at least not allow connections between
   dissimilar versions.  Since DTLS over DCCP simply encapsulates the
   DTLS records transparently, these changes should not affect this
   document and the methods of this document should apply to future
   versions of DTLS.

   Therefore, in the absence of a revision to this document, this
   document is assumed to apply to all future versions of DTLS.  This
   document will only be revised if a revision to DTLS makes a revision
   to the encapsulation necessary.

   It is RECOMMENDED that an application migrating to a new version of
   DTLS keep the same DCCP Service Code used for the old version and
   allow DTLS to provide the version negotiation support.  If a new
   version of DTLS provides significant new capabilities to the
   application that could change the behavior of middleboxes with regard
   to the application, an application developer MAY register a new
   Service Code.

4. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for DTLS are specified in [RFC4347] and for
   DCCP in [RFC4340].  The combination of DTLS and DCCP introduces no
   new security considerations.
