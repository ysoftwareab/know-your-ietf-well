       Abstract 

       The problem of quality analysis and advanced fault detection of 
       a pure light-path in a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing 
       (DWDM) optical network requires the transmission of optical 
       evidence related parameters along the provisioned route. In 
       this draft we propose an RSVP-TE based mechanism to collect and 
       evaluate optical evidence measured over optical nodes along the 
       light-path.

     1. Introduction 

       For successful fault detection on a light-path, we need 
       mechanisms that can collect all physical evidences (consisting 
       of optical measurements such as signal power, OSNR, etc.) that 
       affect the light-path. In this document we propose an RSVP-TE 
       based mechanism for collection of evidences along a light-path. 
       The proposed technique is also suitable for optical networks 
       that suffer of physical dysfunction due the non-ideal optical 
       transmission medium and/or to critical situations (e.g., a 
       fiber cut). In this scenario even if every node along the path 
       is connected, the reachability of the end node with an 
       acceptable signal quality is not guaranteed.  
       The term evidence refers to real optical measurements or 
       estimates computed using a prediction model. The former may 
       require mutually exclusive access to hardware to avoid 
       interference, in which case the evidence is called blocking 
       evidence. In the later case the evidence is classified as non-
       blocking. This draft addresses evidence collection for both 
       blocking and non-blocking evidences.  
        
     2. Evidence Collection 

       For successful fault detection on an optical path, the fault 
       isolation mechanism needs to be aware of all physical evidence 
       (consisting of optical measurements such as signal power, OSNR, 
       Optical Channel Monitor, etc.) that affect the light-path. 
       Consequently this draft proposes control plane based mechanism 
       for evidence collection. How evidences are collected (from data 
       plane) is beyond the scope of this document.  

     2.1. Optical Path Quality Evaluation 

       The quality of an optical path is assessed by collecting the 
       physical evidences along an LSP and evaluating them (e.g. for 
       faulty point detection). In this draft we make use of the 
       LSP_ATTRIBUTES to perform the evidence collection hop by hop 
       along the optical path. 

       It is important to note that collection of blocking evidences 
       require a mutually exclusive access to the resource. Therefore 
       the entire LSP needs to be "locked" until the collection for 
       the blocking evidences is completed. This implies that if 
       another evidence collection process tries to retrieve evidences 
       on the same node-resource already under "Administrative 
       Evidences Locking" status, needs to be aborted. The draft uses

       the RSVP Admin status object to realize "LSP Administrative 
       Evidences locking" to make sure that all nodes are ready to 
       collect the blocking evidence.  

       In the following we first define Optical Evidence 
       classification, and the extensions to LSP ATTRIBUTE and RSVP 
       Admin status objects needed to perform the aforementioned 
       functionalities. Section 2.7 details the signaling mechanism 
       with examples to illustrate how proposed extensions are used 
       for evidence collection. 

     2.2. Optical Evidence Classification and LSP Locking 

       Physical evidences (consisting of optical measurements such as 
       signal power, OSNR, Optical Channel Monitor, etc.) that have 
       effect on the light-path are classified as: 

       o  Blocking evidence. In general blocking evidence is a 
       physical measurement that may require a mutually exclusive 
       access to hardware resources while performing the measurement. 

       o  Non blocking evidence. A physical value that can be probed 
       in parallel at different nodes. 

       Consequently, every optical node can be in three states w.r.t. 
       to a certain reserved resource: unlock, lock-requested or lock. 
       In fact blocking evidence requires the resource to be in lock 
       state. In general this is due to the hardware limitation of 
       optical nodes.   

       In case of blocking evidence the LSP status needs to be set to 
       "Locked". For this purpose, we extend the Admin object 
       [RFC3471], [RFC3473] with B bit (Blocked request bit) and C bit 
       (block Confirm bit). Specifically, Administrative status object 
       is extended with the following two bits for locking purpose.

       Reflect (R): 1 bit 
       When set, indicates that the edge node SHOULD reflect the 
       object/TLV back in the appropriate message.  This bit MUST NOT 
       be set in state change request, i.e., Notify, messages. 
        
       Reserved: 25 bits. This field is reserved.  It MUST be set to 
       zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.  These 
       bits SHOULD be passed through unmodified by transit nodes. 
        
       Testing (T): 1 bit. When set, indicates that the local actions 
       related to the "testing" mode should be taken. 
        
       Administratively down (A): 1 bit. When set, indicates that the 
       local actions related to the "administratively down" state 
       should be taken. 
        
       Deletion in progress (D): 1 bit. When set, indicates that that 
       the local actions related to LSP teardown should be taken.  
       Edge nodes may use this flag to control connection teardown. 
        
       Blocking node (B): 1 bit. When set, indicates that locking 
       procedure is ongoing. 
        
       Confirm blocking (C): 1 bit. When set, indicates that the 
       locking procedure is successfully ongoing. 
        

       During LSP locking for collection of blocking evidence, the R 
       bit (Reflect bit) MUST be set. Furthermore, if the node along 
       the path understands B and C bits, the node MUST return the 
       Admin object in the Resv Message for locking confirmation or 
       unlocking. Since we need to block an entire LSP, any node 
       unable to measure the required blocking evidence MUST set a 
       lock failure (unset the C bit in the Path Admin Object).  

       The general locking procedure is defined as follows: 

       o  Every transit node that receives the Admin status object in 
       the Path message with B, C and R bit set needs to check if the 
       actual status is unlock. 

       o  In the case of unlock status, the node switches to lock-
       required state related to the required blocking evidence. 

        
        
       Z. Ali, et al          Expires January 5, 2009           [Page 5] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection.doc  July 08 
           

       o  In the case of lock or lock-required states, the node 
       forwards the Admin object message without the C bit set. This 
       implies a lock failure.  

       o  The Resv message performs the locking for the entire LSP in 
       case of C and B bit set and unlocking in case of unset C bit. 

       o  Every transit node that receives the Resv message with B and 
       C bit set changes its status to lock.  

       This strategy prevents race conditions.  

     2.3. Optical Evidence Collection  

       Path quality evaluation is based on holistic analysis of the 
       evidence collected along the path of an LSP. To signal which 
       evidence needs to be collected we extend the LSP Attribute TLV 
       sub-object. 

       The evidence collection is performed as follows:  

       o  Source node sends a Path message with LSP Attribute object 
       aimed to inform the transit nodes about the imminent evidence 
       collection. The Path message also contains TLV sub-objects with 
       required evidence.  

       o  Every transit node, when receives the message with LSP 
       Attribute object, assembles the collected evidence (specified 
       in TLV) inside a sub-TLV. The way an optical node gets 
       knowledge of the evidence using information locally available 
       at the node (e.g. via discovery of internal amplifiers, 
       photodiode etc.) is out of the scope of this document.  

       o  Evidence collection will be executed by the returning Resv 
       message that collects hop-by-hop evidence objects by inserting 
       the sub-TLV inside the attached TLV. After successful 
       forwarding of the Resv message the status of transit nodes MUST 
       be switched to unlock for preventing deadlock. 

       In case of blocking evidence the LSP lock MUST be obtained 
       before evidence collection. 

       In case of non-blocking evidence the unavailability of certain 
       evidence in an intermediate node MUST NOT cause the request of 
       failure. The holistic evidence evaluation SHOULD be able to 
       deal with missing non-blocking evidence. 

        
        
       Z. Ali, et al          Expires January 5, 2009           [Page 6] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection.doc  July 08 
           

       When a transit node not in locked state receives a request for 
       blocking evidence, an evidence collection failure (PathErr) 
       SHOULD be sent to the Ingress node.  

     2.4. Evidence Collection Request TLV 

       The proposed encoding scheme for optical evidence measurements 
       defines a TLV associated to a particular evidence type. A TLV 
       sub-object is encoded in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object 
       [RFC4420]. The TLV sub-object encoding is: 

           0                   1                   2

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
       +-+ 
           
       Type: Collected evidence type (TBA). This can be blocking or 
       non blocking type.    

       Length: length of the TLV object in bytes without the 4 byte 
       header. 

       E-type (Evidence Type, 8 bits): Evidence identifier encoded as 
       per [WD6-23]. E.g., 0 for Signal power, 1 for OSNR, 2 for Pilot 
       Tone (as blocking evidence).  

       This TLV defines which types of evidence (signal power, OSNR, 
       Pilot Tone, alarm etc.) need to be collected and is carried by 
       the Path message. 

     2.5. Evidence recording TLV 

       A set of evidence is collected through the Resv message to 
       allow the optical quality evaluation at the ingress node. Each 
       item of optical evidence is collected separately. Every transit 
       node, in the Path message, finds the Evidence Collection 
       Requested TLV and replies the Evidence value in Resv using

       evidence recording TLV (encoded in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object). 
       The evidence value can be measured or estimated. Furthermore it 
       sets the Measure Method inside this TLV according to the kind 
       of measured media (single lambda measurement or aggregate 
       measurement).  
        
       This evidence collection improves the feasibility evaluation 
       where network elements support at least a subset of evidence. 
        
       The following TLV encodes the evidence values of the LSP 
       associated to the evidence type defined in the Evidence 
       Collection Request TLV.

     2.6. Signaling Procedure for evidence collection using RSVP-TE 

       In this section we describe signaling procedures for 
       tracerouting with evidence collection using examples. Consider 
       a GMPLS LSP that has OXC1 as Ingress Node, OXC4 as Egress node 
       with OXC2 and OXC3 in transit, as shown below.  

        
                +------+       +------+       +------+       +------+ 
                |      | ----- |      | ===== |      | ----- |      | 
                | OXC1 | ===== | OXC2 | ----- | OXC3 | ----- | OXC4 | 
                |      | ----- |      | ----- |      | ===== |      | 
                +------+       +------+       +------+       +------+ 
        

       In the following we consider three scenarios of evidence 
       collection and describe signaling procedures associated with 
       the evidence collection and how above mentioned extensions to 
       LSP Attribute and admin status objects are used for this 
       purpose.  

     2.6.1. Non-blocking evidence collection 

       The quality evaluation of an optical path is done after LSP is 
       signaled. In case of non-blocking evidences, evidence 
       collection follows the following procedure: 

       o  OXC1 node sends a Path message with Evidence Collection 
       Request TLV aimed to inform the transit nodes about the 
       imminent evidence collection and about the type of evidence 
       that needs to be collected (e.g., Signal power).      

       o  Every transit node (OXC2,OXC3), when receives the Path 
       message with Evidence Collection Request TLV, starts the 
       internal evidence reading procedure and waits for the 
       correspondent Resv message to forward the related Evidence 
       recording TLV in the upstreaming flow to the ingress node OXC1. 
       If for some reason the evidence is not available, since it is 
       non blocking evidence, the node simply does not include the 
       evidence measure in its own Evidence recording TLV. The 
       holistic analysis can be performed also with a subset of the 
       non blocking evidences.  

       o  Egress node OXC4 sends Resv message with Evidence Collection 
       Request TLV containing optical evidence TLV upstream to the 

        
        
       Z. Ali, et al          Expires January 5, 2009          [Page 10] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection.doc  July 08 
           

       ingress node OXC1 and puts its own evidence value in this 
       Evidence recording TLV. 

       o  Every transit node (OXC3,OXC2) inserts its own Evidences 
       recording TLV inside Resv message in such way that ingress node 
       collects all required evidences hop by hop.  

       o  OXC1 node when receives the Resv message extract the 
       Evidences recording TLV to perform holistic path quality 
       analysis.  

       The transit nodes that do not support LSP_REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE 
       object or do not support evidence request TLV will be addressed 
       in a later version of the document. 

       Summarizing the Evidence collection will be executed by the 
       returning Resv message that collects hop-by-hop evidence 
       objects upstream. 

     2.6.2. Blocking evidence collection with all nodes ready for 
       evidence collection 

       In this scenario the locking strategy needs to be performed 
       first to ensure that no node in the LSP is already locked in 
       another blocking evidences collection. I.e., we need to be sure 
       that all nodes along the path are ready to collect the 
       evidence. This phase uses Admin status object in the Path and 
       Resv message, as follows: 

       o  OXC1 switches to "lock-required" state and sends a Path 
       message with Admin status object with B, C and R bit set. B bit 
       is used to signal locking is required. C bit is used for 
       locking confirmation. Recall it needs to be set if lock is 
       granted, and needs to be unset otherwise.  

       o  Every transit node (OXC2, OXC3) that receives the Admin 
       status object in the Path message with B, C and R bit set 
       switches to "lock-required" state related to the required 
       blocking evidence. 

       o  Egress node OXC4 switches to lock state and forwards the 
       Admin status object in the Resv message, resetting the R bit. 

       o  Every transit node (OXC3,OXC2) that receives the Resv 
       message with B and C bit set changes its state to "locked".  


        
        
       Z. Ali, et al          Expires January 5, 2009          [Page 11] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection.doc  July 08 
           

       o  Ingress node OXC1 when receives the Resv message with Admin 
       status object with B and C bit set switches to "locked" state. 

       At the end of this procedure the entire LSP is in "locked" 
       state and is ready for blocking evidence collection.  

       At this stage the Evidence collection can be performed as 
       described earlier.  

       The locking is performed before evidence collection to maintain 
       a better compatibility with the future available blocking 
       evidences kind that would require further action to be taken 
       before starting the collection. 

     2.6.3.  Blocking evidence collection with some node(s) blocked for 
       evidence collection. 

       In this scenario the locking procedure fails since some node 
       (OXC3 in this example) is in "locked" or "lock-required" state 
       over another LSP. 

       o  OXC1 switches to lock-required state and sends a Path 
       message with Admin status object with B, C and R bit set. B bit 
       is used to signal locking is required. C bit is used for 
       locking confirmation. Recall it needs to be set if lock is 
       granted, and needs to be unset otherwise.   

       o  OXC2 receives the Admin status object in the Path message 
       with B, C and R bit set and switches to "lock-required" state 
       related to the required blocking evidence. 

       o  OXC3 node receives the Admin status object and, since it is 
       already in lock or lock-required state for another LSP with the 
       same resources, unsets the C bit. Therefore the locking 
       procedure will fail. 

       o  Egress node OXC4, since the received Admin object does not 
       have the C bit set, switches to unlock state and forwards the 
       received Admin status object in the Resv message resetting the 
       R bit. 

       o  When the other transit nodes (OXC3, OXC2) receive the Admin 
       object in the Resv message with B bit set but with C bit unset, 
       they switch to unlock state.

       o  When the ingress node OXC1 receives the Resv message with 
       Admin object containing B bit set and C bit unset switches to 
       unlock. 

       At this stage the Locking mechanism fails since the ingress 
       node has not received the confirmation of successful locking (C 
       bit set). 

     3. Security Considerations 

       Security considerations and requirements from [RFC4379] apply 
       equally to this document. Furthermore, there are some 
       additional security considerations that may be induced by the 
       extended RSVP-TE model proposed by this draft. These security 
       considerations will be added in a later version of the draft.
