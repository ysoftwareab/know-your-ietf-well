Internet-Draft       YANG Modules for A+P Softwires         January 2019


1.  Introduction

   The IETF Softwire working group has developed several IPv4-in-IPv6
   softwire mechanisms to address various deployment contexts and
   constraints.  As a companion to the architectural specification
   documents, this document focuses on the provisioning of address plus
   port (A+P) softwire functional elements: Border Routers (BRs) and
   Customer Premises Equipment (CEs, a.k.a., CPE).  The softwire
   mechanisms covered in this document are Lightweight 4 over 6 (lw4o6)
   [RFC7596], Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)
   [RFC7597], and Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T)
   [RFC7599].

   This document focuses on A+P mechanisms [RFC6346]; the reader can
   refer to [RFC8513] for a YANG module for DS-Lite [RFC6333].

   This document defines YANG modules [RFC7950] that can be used to
   configure and manage A+P softwire elements using the NETCONF
   [RFC6241], or RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocols for:

   o  Configuration

   o  Operational State

   o  Notifications

2.  Terminology

   The reader should be familiar with the concepts and terms defined in
   [RFC7596], [RFC7597], [RFC7599], and the YANG data modelling language
   defined in [RFC7950].

   The YANG modules in this document adopt the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  The meanings of the symbols
   used in tree diagrams are defined in [RFC8340].

   The document uses the abbrieviation 'BR' as a general term for
   softwire tunnel concentrators, including both MAP Border Routers
   [RFC7597] and Lightweight 4over6 lWAFTRs [RFC7596].

   For brevity, "algorithm" is used to refer to the "mapping algorithm"
   defined in [RFC7597].

   A network element may support one or multiple instances of a softwire
   mechanism; each of these instances (i.e., binding instances, MAP-E
   instances, or MAP-T instances) may have its own configuration and
   parameters.  The term 'algo-instance' is used to denote both MAP-E
   and MAP-T instances.

Internet-Draft       YANG Modules for A+P Softwires         January 2019


3.  Overview of the Modules

3.1.  Overall Structure

   The document defines the following two YANG modules for the
   configuration and monitoring of softwire functional elements:

   ietf-softwire-ce      Provides configuration and monitoring for
                         softwire CE element.  This module is defined as
                         augments to the interface YANG module
                         [RFC8343].

   ietf-softwire-br      Provides configuration and monitoring for
                         softwire BR element.

   In addition, the following module is defined:

   ietf-softwire-common  Contains groups of common functions that are
                         imported into the CE and BR modules.

   This approach has been taken so that the various modules can be
   easily extended to support additional softwire mechanisms, if
   required.

   Within the BR and CE modules, the YANG "feature" statement is used to
   distinguish which of the different softwire mechanism(s) is relevant
   for a specific element's configuration.  For each module, a choice
   statement 'ce-type' is included for either 'binding' or 'algorithm'.
   'Binding' is used for configuring Lightweight 4over6, whereas
   'algorithm' is used for configuring MAP-T or MAP-E.

   In the 'algo-instances' container, a choice statement 'data-plane' is
   included to specify MAP-E (encapsulation) or MAP-T (translation).
   Table 1 shows how these choices are used to indicate the desired
   softwire mechanism:

            +--------------------+-----------+---------------+
            |   S46 Mechanism    |  ce-type? |  data-plane?  |
            +--------------------+-----------+---------------+
            | Lightweight 4over6 |  binding  |      n/a      |
            |       MAP-E        | algorithm | encapsulation |
            |       MAP-T        | algorithm |  translation  |
            +--------------------+-----------+---------------+

         Table 1: Softwire Mechanism Choice Statement Enumeration

   NETCONF notifications are also included.

      Note: Earlier versions of this specification combined the softwire
      mechanisms by their associated technologies rather than their
      function in the architecture.  As the document was revised, it
      became apparent that dividing the modules by their role in the
      architecture (CE or BR) was a better approach as this follows the
      intended function and existing implementation approaches more
      closely.

3.2.  Additional Components Configuration

   The softwire modules only aim to provide configuration relevant for
   softwires.  In order to fully provision a CE element, the following
   may also be necessary:

   o  IPv6 forwarding and routing configuration, enabling the CE to
      obtain one or more IPv6 prefixes for softwire usage.  A YANG
      module for routing management is described in [RFC8349].

   o  IPv4 routing configuration, to add one or more IPv4 destination
      prefix(es) reachable via the configured softwire.  A YANG module
      for routing management is described in [RFC8349].

   o  Stateful NAT44/NAPT management, to optionally specify a port set
      (Port Set Identifier (PSID)) along with its length.  A YANG module
      for NAT management is described in [RFC8512].

   o  Stateless NAT46 management, required by softwire translation based
      mechanisms (i.e., the assignment of a Network-Specific Prefix to
      use for IPv4/IPv6 translation).  A YANG module for NAT management
      is described in [RFC8512].

   As YANG modules for the above functions are already defined in other
   documents, their functionality is not duplicated here and they should
   be referred to, as needed.  Appendix A.3 provides XML examples of how
   these modules can be used together.

   The CE must already have minimal IPv6 configuration in place so it is
   reachable by the NETCONF client to obtain softwire configuration.  If
   additional IPv6 specific configuration is necessary, the YANG modules
   defined in [RFC8344] and [RFC8349] may be used.

4.  Softwire CE YANG Tree Diagram

4.1.  CE Tree Diagram

   The CE module provides configuration and monitoring for all of the
   softwire mechanisms covered in this document (i.e., Lightweight
   4over6, MAP-E, and MAP-T).

   This module augments "ietf-interfaces", defined in [RFC8343] with an
   entry for the softwire.  This entry can be referenced to configure
   IPv4 forwarding features for the element.  This entry is added only
   if tunnel type (Section 10) is set to 'aplusp'.

4.2.  Softwire CE Tree Diagram Description

   Additional information related to the operation of a CE element is
   provided below:

   o  softwire-payload-mtu: optionally used to set the IPv4 MTU for the
      softwire.  Needed if the softwire implementation is unable to
      correctly calculate the correct IPv4 Maximum Transit Unit (MTU)
      size automatically.

   o  softwire-path-mru: optionally used to set the maximum IPv6
      softwire packet size that can be received, including the
      encapsulation/translation overhead.  Needed if the softwire
      implementation is unable to correctly calculate the correct IPv4
      payload Maximum Receive Unit (MRU) size automatically (see
      Section 3.2 of [RFC4213]).

   o  ce-type: provides a choice statement allowing the binding or
      algorithmic softwire mechanisms to be selected.

   Further details relevant to binding softwire elements are:

   o  binding-ipv6info: used to set the IPv6 binding prefix type to
      identify which IPv6 address to use as the tunnel source.  It can
      be 'ipv6-prefix' or 'ipv6-address'.

   o  br-ipv6-addr: sets the IPv6 address of the remote BR.

   Additional details relevant to some of the important algorithmic
   elements are provided below:

   o  algo-versioning: optionally used to associate a version number
      and/or timestamp to the algorithm.  This can be used for logging/
      data retention purposes [RFC7422].  The version number is selected
      to uniquely identify the algorithm configuration and a new value
      written whenever a change is made to the algorithm or a new algo-
      instance is created.

   o  forwarding: specifies whether the rule can be used as a Forward
      Mapping Rule (FMR).  If not set, this rule is a Basic Mapping Rule
      (BMR) only and must not be used for forwarding.  Refer to
      Section 4.1 of [RFC7598].

   o  ea-len: used to set the length of the Embedded-Address (EA), which
      is defined in the mapping rule for a MAP domain.

   o  data-plane: provides a choice statement for either encapsulation
      (MAP-E) or translation (MAP-T).

   o  br-ipv6-addr: defines the IPv6 address of the BR.  This
      information is valid for MAP-E.

   o  dmr-ipv6-prefix: defines the Default Mapping Rule (DMR) IPv6
      prefix of the BR.  This information is valid for MAP-T.

   Additional information on the notification node is listed below:

   o  ce-binding-ipv6-addr-change: if the CE's binding IPv6 address
      changes for any reason, the NETCONF client will be notified.

5.2.  Softwire BR Tree Diagram Description

   The descriptions for leaves which are common with the CE module are
   provided in Section 4.2.  Descriptions for additional elements are
   provided below:

   o  binding-table-versioning: optionally used to associate a version
      number and/or timestamp to the binding table.  This can be used
      for logging or data retention purposes [RFC7422].  The version
      number is selected to uniquely identify the binding table
      configuration and a new timestamp value written whenever a change
      is made to the contents of the binding table or a new binding
      table list is created.

   o  binding-entry: used to define the binding relationship between

      3-tuples {lwB4's IPv6 address/prefix, the allocated IPv4 address,
      restricted port-set}. For detail information, please refer to
      [RFC7596].

   o  softwire-num-max: used to set the maximum number of softwire
      binding rules that can be created on the lw4o6 element
      simultaneously.  This paramter must not be set to zero because
      this is equivalent to disabling the BR instance.

   o  active-softwire-num: holds the number of softwires currently
      provisioned on the BR element.

   Additional information on some of the important notification nodes is
   listed below:

   o  invalid-entry, added-entry, modified-entry: used to notify the
      NETCONF client that a specific binding entry or MAP rule has
      expired, been invalidated, added, or modified.

       Binding based softwire mechanisms are IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnelling
       transition mechanisms specifically intended for complete
       independence between the IPv6 subnet prefix (and IPv6 address)
       and IPv4 address, with or without IPv4 address sharing.

       This is accomplished by maintaining state for each softwire
       (per-subscriber state) in the central Border Relay (BR) and using
       a hub-and-spoke forwarding architecture. In order to delegate the
       NAPT function and achieve IPv4 address sharing, port-restricted
       IPv4 addresses needs to be allocated to CEs.

       This feature indicates that the network element can function as
       one or more binding based softwire instances.";

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   All data nodes defined in the YANG modules which can be created,
   modified, and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are
   considered sensitive.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) applied

   to these data nodes without proper protection can negatively affect
   network operations.  An attacker who is able to access the BR can
   undertake various attacks, such as:

   o  Setting the value of 'br-ipv6-addr' on the CE to point to an
      illegitimate BR so that it can intercept all the traffic sent by a
      CE.  Illegitimately intercepting users' traffic is an attack with
      severe implications on privacy.

   o  Setting the MTU to a low value, which may increase the number of
      fragments ('softwire-payload-mtu').

   o  Disabling hairpinning (i.e., setting 'enable-hairpinning' to
      'false') to prevent communications between CEs.

   o  Setting 'softwire-num-max' to an arbitrary high value, which may
      be exploited by a misbehaving user to perform a DoS on the binding
      BR by mounting a massive number of softwires.

   o  Setting 'icmpv4-rate' or 'icmpv6-rate' to a low value, which may
      lead to the deactivation of ICMP messages handling.

   o  Accessing to private data maintained by the BR (e.g., the binding
      table or the algorithm configuration).  Such data can be misused
      to track the activity of a host.

   o  Instructing the BR to install entries which in turn will induce a
      DDoS attack by means of the notifications generated by the BR.
      This DDoS can be softened by defining a notification interval, but
      given that this interval parameter can be disabled or set to a low
      value by the misbehaving entity, the same problem will be
      observed.

   Security considerations related to lw4o6, MAP-T, and MAP-E are
   discussed in [RFC7596], [RFC7597], and [RFC7599] respectively.

   Security considerations given in [RFC7950] are also applicable here.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a new tunnel type under the
   "tunnelType" sub-registry of the "ifType definitions" registry
   maintained at [TUNNELTYPE-IANA-REGISTRY] and use the following data
   for the new entry:

Appendix A.  Configuration Examples

   The following sections provide examples of how the softwire YANG
   modules can be used for configuring softwire elements.

A.1.  Configuration Example for a lw4o6 BR Binding-Table

   The lwAFTR maintains an address binding table which contains the
   following 3-tuples:

   o  IPv6 Address for a single lwB4

   o  Public IPv4 Address

   o  Restricted port-set

   The entry has two functions: the IPv6 encapsulation of inbound IPv4
   packets destined to the lwB4 and the validation of outbound IPv4-in-
   IPv6 packets received from the lwB4 for de-capsulation.

   Consider an example for the following lw4o6 binding table entry:

   lwB4 Binding IPv6 Address:  2001:db8::1

   lwB4 Binding IPv4 Address:  192.0.2.1

   lwB4 PSID:                  0x34

   lwB4 PSID Length            8

   BR IPv6 Address:            2001:db8:1::2

         </binding>
       </br-instances>

A.2.  Configuration Example for a MAP-E BR

   A MAP-E BR is configured with forward mapping rules for the CEs it is
   serving.  In this example (taken from [RFC7597], Appendix A, Example
   2), the following parameters are required:

   o  Rule IPv6 Prefix

   o  Rule IPv4 Prefix

   o  Rule EA-bit bit length

   o  IPv6 Address of MAP-BR

   The mapping rule has two functions: identifying the destination CE
   IPv6 address for encapsulating inbound IPv4 packets and the
   validation of outbound IPv4-in-IPv6 packets received from the CE for
   de-capsulation.

   The transport type for the data plane also needs to be configured for
   encapsulation to enable MAP-E and forwarding needs to be enabled.

   Consider an example for the following MAP-E Forwarding Mapping Rule:

A.3.  lw4o6 CE Configuration Example

   This section provides XML examples for configuring a lw4o6 CE.
   Examples for routing and NAT44 are also provided for convienience.

   Consider an example for the following lw4o6 CE configuration:

   lwB4 Binding IPv6 Address:  2001:db8::1

   lwB4 Binding IPv4 Address:  192.0.2.1

   lwB4 PSID:                  0x34

   lwB4 PSID Length            8

                   Figure 5: lw4o6 CE Configuration XML

   In the example depicted in Figure 5, the interface name is defined
   for the softwire tunnel.  This name is then referenced by the routing
   configuration for the IPv4 route.  Figure 6 provides an example
   configuration for the CE's IPv4 routing, using the YANG module
   described in [RFC8349].
