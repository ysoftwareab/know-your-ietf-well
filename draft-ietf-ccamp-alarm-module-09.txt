Abstract

   This document defines a YANG module for alarm management.  It
   includes functions for alarm list management, alarm shelving and
   notifications to inform management systems.  There are also
   operations to manage the operator state of an alarm and
   administrative alarm procedures.  The module carefully maps to
   relevant alarm standards.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] module for alarm management.
   The purpose is to define a standardized alarm interface for network
   devices that can be easily integrated into management applications.
   The model is also applicable as a northbound alarm interface in the
   management applications.

   Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
   Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the network
   services or necessarily point to the root cause.  However, being able
   to feed alarms to the alarm management application in a standardized
   format is a starting point for performing higher level network
   assurance tasks.

   The design of the module is based on experience from using and
   implementing available alarm standards from ITU [X.733], 3GPP
   [ALARMIRP] and ANSI [ISA182].

1.1.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950]:

   o  action

   o  client

   o  data tree

   o  server

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  Alarm (the general concept): An alarm signifies an undesirable
      state in a resource that requires corrective action.

   o  Fault: A fault is the underlying cause of an undesired behavior.
      There is no trivial one-to-one mapping between faults and alarms.
      One fault may result in several alarms in case the system lacks
      root-cause and correlation capabilities.  An alarm might not have
      an underlying fault as a cause.  For example, imagine a bad Mean
      Opinion Score (MOS) alarm from a Voice over IP (VOIP) probe and
      the cause being non-optimal QoS configuration.

   o  Alarm Type: An alarm type identifies a possible unique alarm state
      for a resource.  Alarm types are names to identify the state like
      "link-alarm", "jitter-violation", "high-disk-utilization".

   o  Resource: A fine-grained identification of the alarming resource,
      for example: an interface, a process.

   o  Alarm Instance: The alarm state for a specific resource and alarm
      type.  For example ("GigabitEthernet0/15", link-alarm).  An entry
      in the alarm list.

   o  Cleared alarm: A cleared alarm is an alarm where the system
      considers the undesired state to be cleared.  Operators can not
      clear alarms, clearance is managed by the system.  For example, a
      linkUp notification can be considered a clear condition for a
      linkDown state.

   o  Closed alarm: Operators can close alarms irrespective of the alarm
      being cleared or not.  A closed alarm indicates that the alarm
      does not need attention, either since the corrective action has
      been taken or that it can be ignored for other reasons.

   o  Alarm Inventory: A list of all possible alarm types on a system.

   o  Alarm Shelving: Blocking alarms according to specific criteria.

   o  Corrective Action: An action taken by an operator or automation
      routine in order to minimize the impact of the alarm or resolve
      the root cause.

   o  Management System: The alarm management application that consumes
      the alarms, i.e., acts as a client.

   o  System: The system that implements this YANG alarm module, i.e.,
      acts as a server.  This corresponds to a network device or a
      management application that provides a northbound alarm interface.

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  Objectives

   The objectives for the design of the Alarm Module are:

   o  Simple to use.  If a system supports this module, it shall be
      straight-forward to integrate this into a YANG based alarm
      manager.

   o  View alarms as states on resources and not as discrete
      notifications.

   o  To provide a precise definition of "alarm" in order to exclude
      general events that should not be forwarded as alarm
      notifications.

   o  To provide precise identification of alarm types and alarm
      instances.

   o  A management system should be able to pull all available alarm
      types from a system, i.e., read the alarm inventory from a system.
      This makes it possible to prepare alarm operators with
      corresponding alarm instructions.

   o  Address alarm usability requirements, see Appendix G.  While IETF
      and telecom standards have addressed alarms mostly from a protocol
      perspective, the process industry has published several relevant
      standards addressing requirements for a useful alarm interface;
      [EEMUA], [ISA182].  This alarm module defines usability
      requirements as well as a YANG data model.

   o  Mapping to [X.733], which is a requirement for some alarm systems.
      Still, keep some of the X.733 concepts out of the core model in
      order to make the model small and easy to understand.

3.  Alarm Module Concepts

   This section defines the fundamental concepts behind the data model.
   This section is rooted in the works of Vallin et. al [ALARMSEM].

3.1.  Alarm Definition

   An alarm signifies an undesirable state in a resource that requires
   corrective action.

   There are two main things to remember from this definition:



Vallin & Bjorklund      Expires October 13, 2019                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


   1.  the definition focuses on leaving out events and logging
       information in general.  Alarms should only be used for undesired
       states that require action.

   2.  the definition also focuses on alarms as a state on a resource,
       not the notifications that report the state changes.

   See Appendix F for information how this definition relates to other
   alarm standards.

3.2.  Alarm Type

   This document defines an alarm type with an alarm type id and an
   alarm type qualifier.

   The alarm type id is modeled as a YANG identity.  With YANG
   identities, new alarm types can be defined in a distributed fashion.
   YANG identities are hierarchical, which means that a hierarchy of
   alarm types can be defined.

   Standards and vendors should define their own alarm type identities
   based on this definition.

   The use of YANG identities means that all possible alarms are
   identified at design time.  This explicit declaration of alarm types
   makes it easier to allow for alarm qualification reviews and
   preparation of alarm actions and documentation.

   There are occasions where the alarm types are not known at design
   time.  An example is a system with digital inputs that allows users
   to connect detectors, such as smoke detectors, to the inputs.  In
   this case it is a configuration action that says that certain
   connectors are fire alarms for example.

   In order to allow for dynamic addition of alarm types the alarm
   module allows for further qualification of the identity-based alarm
   type using a string.  A potential drawback of this is that there is a
   significant risk that alarm operators will receive alarm types as a
   surprise.  They do not know how to resolve the problem since a
   defined alarm procedure does not necessarily exist.  To avoid this
   risk the system MUST publish all possible alarm types in the alarm
   inventory, see Section 4.2.

   A vendor or standards organization can define their own alarm type
   hierarchy.  The example below shows a hierarchy based on X.733 event
   types:





Vallin & Bjorklund      Expires October 13, 2019                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity vendor-alarms {
       base al:alarm-type;
     }
     identity communications-alarm {
       base vendor-alarms;
     }
     identity link-alarm {
       base communications-alarm;
     }

   Alarm types can be abstract.  An abstract alarm type is used as a
   base for defining hierarchical alarm types.  Concrete alarm types are
   used for alarm states and appear in the alarm inventory.  There are
   two kinds of concrete alarm types:

   1.  The last subordinate identity in the "alarm-type-id" hierarchy is
       concrete, for example: "alarm-identity.environmental-
       alarm.smoke".  In this example "alarm-identity" and
       "environmental-alarm" are abstract YANG identities, whereas
       "smoke" is a concrete YANG identity.

   2.  The YANG identity hierarchy is abstract and the concrete alarm
       type is defined by the dynamic alarm qualifier string, for
       example: "alarm-identity.environmental-alarm.external-detector"
       with alarm-type-qualifier "smoke".

   For example:

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


     // Alternative 1: concrete alarm type identity
     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity environmental-alarm {
       base al:alarm-type;
       description "Abstract alarm type";
     }
     identity smoke {
       base environmental-alarm;
       description "Concrete alarm type";
     }

     // Alternative 2: concrete alarm type qualifier
     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity environmental-alarm {
       base al:alarm-type;
       description "Abstract alarm type";
     }
     identity external-detector {
       base environmental-alarm;
       description
         "Abstract alarm type, a run-time configuration
          procedure sets the type of alarm detected. This will
          be reported in the alarm-type-qualifier.";
     }

   A server SHOULD strive to minimize the number of dynamically defined
   alarm types.

3.3.  Identifying the Alarming Resource

   It is of vital importance to be able to refer to the alarming
   resource.  This reference must be as fine-grained as possible.  If
   the alarming resource exists in the data tree then an instance-
   identifier MUST be used with the full path to the object.

   When the module is used in a controller/orchestrator/manager the
   original device resource identification can be modified to include
   the device in the path.  The details depend on how devices are
   identified, and are out of scope for this specification.

   Example:

      The original device alarm might identify the resource as
      "/dev:interfaces/dev:interface[dev:name='FastEthernet1/0']".

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


      The resource identification in the manager could look something
      like: "/mgr:devices/mgr:device[mgr:name='xyz123']/dev:interfaces/
      dev:interface[dev:name='FastEthernet1/0']"

   This module also allows for alternate naming of the alarming resource
   if it is not available in the data tree.

3.4.  Identifying Alarm Instances

   A primary goal of this alarm module is to remove any ambiguity in how
   alarm notifications are mapped to an update of an alarm instance.
   The X.733 and 3GPP documents were not clear on this point.  This YANG
   alarm module states that the tuple (resource, alarm type identifier,
   alarm type qualifier) corresponds to a single alarm instance.  This
   means that alarm notifications for the same resource and same alarm
   type are matched to update the same alarm instance.  These three
   leafs are therefore used as the key in the alarm list:

     list alarm {
       key "resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier";
       ...
     }

3.5.  Alarm Lifecycle

   The alarm model clearly separates the resource alarm lifecycle from
   the operator and administrative lifecycles of an alarm.

   o  resource alarm lifecycle: the alarm instrumentation that controls
      alarm raise, clearance, and severity changes.

   o  operator alarm lifecycle: operators acting upon alarms with
      actions like acknowledgment and closing.  Closing an alarm implies
      that the operator considers the corrective action performed.
      Operators can also shelf (block/filter) alarms in order to avoid
      nuisance alarms.

   o  administrative alarm lifecycle: purging (deleting) unwanted alarms
      and compressing the alarm status change list.  This module exposes
      operations to manage the administrative lifecycle.  The server may
      also perform these operations based on other policies, but how
      that is done is out of scope for this document.

   A server SHOULD describe how long it retains cleared/closed alarms:
   until manually purged or if it has an automatic removal policy.  How
   this is done is outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


3.5.1.  Resource Alarm Lifecycle

   From a resource perspective, an alarm can for example have the
   following lifecycle: raise, change severity, change severity, clear,
   being raised again, etc.  All of these status changes can have
   different alarm texts generated by the instrumentation.  Two
   important things to note:

   1.  Alarms are not deleted when they are cleared.  Deleting alarms is
       an administrative process.  The alarm module defines an action
       "purge-alarms" that deletes alarms.

   2.  Alarms are not cleared by operators, only the underlying
       instrumentation can clear an alarm.  Operators can close alarms.

   The YANG tree representation below illustrates the resource oriented
   lifecycle:

     +--ro alarm* [resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier]
        ...
        +--ro is-cleared                 boolean
        +--ro last-changed               yang:date-and-time
        +--ro perceived-severity         severity
        +--ro alarm-text                 alarm-text
        +--ro status-change* [time] {alarm-history}?
           +--ro time                    yang:date-and-time
           +--ro perceived-severity      severity-with-clear
           +--ro alarm-text              alarm-text

   For every status change from the resource perspective a row is added
   to the "status-change" list, if the server implements the feature
   "alarm-history".  The feature "alarm-history" is optional to
   implement, since keeping the alarm history may have an impact on the
   server's memory resources.

   The last status values are also represented as leafs for the alarm.
   Note well that the alarm severity does not include "cleared", alarm
   clearance is a boolean flag.

   An alarm can therefore look like this: (("GigabitEthernet0/25", link-
   alarm,""), false, 2018-04-08T08:20:10.00Z, major, "Interface
   GigabitEthernet0/25 down")

3.5.2.  Operator Alarm Lifecycle

   Operators can act upon alarms using the set-operator-state action:

        ...

              +---w text?    string

   The operator state for an alarm can be: "none", "ack", "shelved", and
   "closed".  Alarm deletion (using the action "purge-alarms") can use
   this state as a criterion.  For example, a closed alarm is an alarm
   where the operator has performed any required corrective actions.
   Closed alarms are good candidates for being purged.

3.5.3.  Administrative Alarm Lifecycle

   Deleting alarms from the alarm list is considered an administrative
   action.  This is supported by the "purge-alarms" action.  The "purge-
   alarms" action takes a filter as input.  The filter selects alarms
   based on the operator and resource lifecycle such as "all closed
   cleared alarms older than a time specification".  The server may also
   perform these operations based on other policies, but how that is
   done is out of scope for this document.

   Purged alarms are removed from the alarm list.  Note well, if the
   alarm resource state changes after a purge, the alarm will reappear
   in the alarm list.

   Alarms can be compressed.  Compressing an alarm deletes all entries
   in the alarm's "status-change" list except for the last status
   change.  A client can perform this using the "compress-alarms"
   action.  The server may also perform these operations based on other
   policies, but how that is done is out of scope for this document.

3.6.  Root Cause, Impacted Resources and Related Alarms

   The alarm module does not mandate any requirements for the system to
   support alarm correlation or root-cause and service-impact analysis.
   However, if such features are supported, this section describes how
   the results of such analysis are represented in the data model.
   These parts of the model are optional.  The module supports three
   scenarios:





Vallin & Bjorklund      Expires October 13, 2019               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


   Root cause analysis:  An alarm can indicate candidate root cause
      resources, for example: a database issue alarm referring to a full
      disc partition.

   Service impact analysis:  An alarm can refer to potential impacted
      resources, for example: an interface alarm referring to impacted
      network services

   Alarm correlation:  Dependencies between alarms, several alarms can
      be grouped as relating to each other, for example a streaming
      media alarm relating to a high jitter alarm.

   Different systems have varying degrees of alarm correlation and
   analysis capabilities, and the intent of the alarm module is to
   enable any capability, including none.

   The general principle of this alarm module is to limit the amount of
   alarms.  In many cases several resources are affected for a given
   underlying problem.  A full disk will of course impact databases and
   applications as well.  The recommendation is to have a single alarm
   for the underlying problem and list the affected resources in the
   alarm, rather than having separate alarms for each resource.

   The alarm has one leaf-list to identify possible "impacted-resources"
   and a leaf-list to identify possible "root-cause-resources".  These
   serves as hints only.  It is up to the client application to use this
   information to present the overall status.  Using the disk full
   example, a good alarm would be to use the hard disk partition as the
   alarming resource and add the database and applications into the
   "impacted-resources" leaf-list.

   A system should always strive to identify the resource that can be
   acted upon as the "resource" leaf.  The "impacted-resource" leaf-list
   shall be used to identify any side-effects of the alarm.  The
   impacted resources can not be acted upon to fix the problem.  The
   disk full example above illustrates the principle; you can not fix
   the underlying issue by database operations.  However, you need to
   pay attention to the database to perform any operations that limits
   the impact of problem.

   On some occasions the system might not be capable of detecting the
   root cause, the resource that can be acted upon.  The instrumentation
   in this case only monitors the side-effect and raises an alarm to
   indicate a situation requiring attention.  The instrumentation still
   might identify possible candidates for the root-cause resource.  In
   this case the "root-cause-resource" leaf-list can be used to indicate
   the candidate root-cause resources.  An example of this kind of alarm
   might be an active test tool that detects an SLA violation on a VPN

   connection and identifies the devices along the chain as candidate
   root causes.

   The alarm module also supports a way to associate different alarms to
   each other with the "related-alarm" list.  This list enables the
   server to inform the client that certain alarms are related to other
   alarms.

   Note well that this module does not prescribe any dependencies or
   preference between the above alarm correlation mechanisms.  Different
   systems have different capabilities and the above described
   mechanisms are available to support the instrumentation features.

3.7.  Alarm Shelving

   Alarm shelving is an important function in order for alarm management
   applications and operators to stop superfluous alarms.  A shelved
   alarm implies that any alarms fulfilling these criteria are ignored
   (blocked/filtered).  Shelved alarms appear in a dedicated shelved
   alarm list in order to be filtered out from the alarm list in order
   for the main alarm list to only contain entries of interest.  Shelved
   alarms do not generate notifications but the shelved alarm list is
   updated with any alarm state changes.

   Alarm shelving is optional to implement, since matching alarms
   against shelf criteria may have an impact on the server's processing
   resources.

3.8.  Alarm Profiles

   Alarm profiles are used to configure further information to an alarm
   type.  This module supports configuring severity levels overriding
   the system default levels.  This corresponds to the Alarm Assignment
   Profile, ASAP, functionality in M.3100 [M.3100] and M.3160 [M.3160].
   Other standard or enterprise modules can augment this list with
   further alarm type information.

4.  Alarm Data Model

   The fundamental parts of the data model are the "alarm-list" with
   associated notifications and the "alarm-inventory" list of all
   possible alarm types.  These MUST be implemented by a system.  The
   rest of the data model are made conditional with the YANG features
   "operator-actions", "alarm-shelving", "alarm-history", "alarm-
   summary", "alarm-profile", and "severity-assignment".

   The data model has the following overall structure:

4.1.  Alarm Control

   The "/alarms/control/notify-status-changes" leaf controls if
   notifications are sent for all state changes, only raise and clear,
   or only notifications more severe than a configured level.  This
   feature in combination with alarm shelving corresponds to the ITU
   Alarm Report Control functionality, see Appendix F.2.4.

   Every alarm has a list of status changes.  The length of this list is
   controlled by "/alarms/control/max-alarm-status-changes".  When the
   list is full and a new entry created, the oldest entry is removed.

4.1.1.  Alarm Shelving

   The shelving control tree is shown below:

     +--rw control
        +--rw alarm-shelving {alarm-shelving}?
           +--rw shelf* [name]
              +--rw name           string
              +--rw resource*      resource-match

              |  +--rw alarm-type-id                 alarm-type-id
              |  +--rw alarm-type-qualifier-match    string
              +--rw description?   string


   Shelved alarms are shown in a dedicated shelved alarm list.  Matching
   alarms MUST appear in the /alarms/shelved-alarms/shelved-alarm list,
   and non-matching /alarms MUST appear in the /alarms/alarm-list/alarm
   list.  The server does not send any notifications for shelved alarms.

   Shelving and unshelving can only be performed by editing the shelf
   configuration.  It cannot be performed on individual alarms.  The
   server will add an operator state indicating that the alarm was
   shelved/unshelved.

   A leaf (/alarms/summary/shelves-active) in the alarm summary
   indicates if there are shelved alarms.

   A system can select to not support the shelving feature.

4.2.  Alarm Inventory

   The alarm inventory represents all possible alarm types that may
   occur in the system.  A management system may use this to build alarm
   procedures.  The alarm inventory is relevant for several reasons:



Vallin & Bjorklund      Expires October 13, 2019               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


      The system might not implement all defined alarm type identities,
      and some alarm identities are abstract.

      The system has configured dynamic alarm types using the alarm
      qualifier.  The inventory makes it possible for the management
      system to discover these.

   Note that the mechanism whereby dynamic alarm types are added using
   the alarm type qualifier MUST populate this list.

   The optional leaf-list "resource" in the alarm inventory enables the
   system to publish for which resources a given alarm type may appear.

   A server MUST implement the alarm inventory in order to enable
   controlled alarm procedures in the client.

   A server implementer may want to document the alarm inventory for
   off-line processing by clients.  The file format defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format] can be used for this
   purpose.

   The alarm inventory tree is shown below:

     +--ro alarm-inventory
        +--ro alarm-type* [alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier]
           +--ro alarm-type-id           alarm-type-id

           +--ro description             string


4.3.  Alarm Summary

   The alarm summary list summarizes alarms per severity; how many
   cleared, cleared and closed, and closed.  It also gives an indication
   if there are shelved alarms.

   The alarm summary tree is shown below:

4.4.  The Alarm List

   The alarm list (/alarms/alarm-list) is a function from the tuple
   (resource, alarm type, alarm type qualifier) to the current composite
   alarm state.  The composite state includes states for the resource
   lifecycle such as severity, clearance flag and operator states such
   as acknowledgment.  This means that for a given resource and alarm
   type the alarm list shows the current states of the alarm such as
   acknowledged and cleared status.

   Every alarm has three important states, the resource clearance state
   "is-cleared", the severity "perceived-severity" and the operator
   state available in the operator state change list.

   In order to see the alarm history the resource state changes are
   available in the "status-change" list and the operator history is
   available in the "operator-state-change" list.

4.5.  The Shelved Alarms List

   The shelved alarm list has the same structure as the alarm list
   above.  It shows all the alarms that matches the shelving criteria
   (/alarms/control/alarm-shelving).

4.6.  Alarm Profiles

   Alarm profiles (/alarms/alarm-profile) is a list of configurable
   alarm types.  The list supports configurable alarm severity levels in
   the container "alarm-severity-assignment-profile".  If an alarm
   matches the configured alarm type it MUST use the configured severity
   level(s) instead of the system default.  This configuration MUST also
   be represented in the alarm inventory.

4.7.  Operations

   The alarm module supports the following actions to manage the alarms:

   /alarms/alarm-list/purge-alarms:  Delete alarms from the "alarm-list"
      according to specific criteria, for example all cleared alarms
      older than a specific date.

   /alarms/alarm-list/compress-alarms:  Compress the "status-change"
      list for the alarms.

   /alarms/alarm-list/alarm/set-operator-state:  Change the operator
      state for an alarm.  For example, an alarm can be acknowledged by
      setting the operator state to "ack".

   /alarms/shelved-alarm-list/purge-shelved-alarms:  Delete alarms from
      the "shelved-alarm-list" according to specific criteria, for
      example all alarms older than a specific date.

   /alarms/shelved-alarm-list/compress-shelved-alarms:  Compress the
      "status-change" list for the alarms.

4.8.  Notifications

   The alarm module supports a general notification to report alarm
   state changes.  It carries all relevant parameters for the alarm
   management application.

   There is also a notification to report that an operator changed the
   operator state on an alarm, like acknowledge.

   If the alarm inventory is changed, for example a new card type is
   inserted, a notification will tell the management application that

5.  Relationship to the ietf-hardware YANG module

   RFC 8348 [RFC8348] defines the "ietf-hardware" YANG data model for
   the management of hardware.  The "alarm-state" in RFC 8348 is a
   summary of the alarm severity levels that may be active on the
   specific hardware component.  It does not say anything about how
   alarms are reported, and it doesn't provide any details of the
   alarms.

   The mapping between the alarm YANG data model and the "alarm-state"
   in RFC 8348 is as follows:

   is-cleared:  No bit set in "/hardware/component/state/alarm-state"

   perceived-severity:  Corresponding bit set in
      "/hardware/component/state/alarm-state".

   operator-state-change/state:  If the alarm is acknowledged by the
      operator, the bit "under-repair" is in "/hardware/component/state/
      alarm-state".

          * Alarm list:
                    A list of all alarms.  Cleared alarms stay in
                    the list until explicitly purged.

          * Operator actions on alarms:
                    Acknowledging and closing alarms.

          * Administrative actions on alarms:
                    Purging alarms from the list according to specific
                    criteria.

          * Alarm inventory:
                    A management application can read all
                    alarm types implemented by the system.

          * Alarm shelving:
                    Shelving (blocking) alarms according
                    to specific criteria.

          * Alarm profiles:
                    A management system can attach further
                    information to alarm types, for example
                    overriding system default severity
                    levels.

        This module uses a stateful view on alarms.  An alarm is a state
        for a specific resource (note that an alarm is not a
        notification).  An alarm type is a possible alarm state for a
        resource.  For example, the tuple:

          ('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25')

        is an alarm of type 'link-alarm' on the resource
        'GigabitEthernet0/25'.

        Alarm types are identified using YANG identities and an optional
        string-based qualifier.  The string-based qualifier allows for
        dynamic extension of the statically defined alarm types.  Alarm
        types identify a possible alarm state and not the individual
        notifications.  For example, the traditional 'link-down' and
        'link-up' notifications are two notifications referring to the
        same alarm type 'link-alarm'.

        With this design there is no ambiguity about how alarm and alarm
        clear correlation should be performed: notifications that report
        the same resource and alarm type are considered updates of the
        same alarm, e.g., clearing an active alarm or changing the
        severity of an alarm.

        The instrumentation can update 'severity' and 'alarm-text' on an
        existing alarm.  The above alarm example can therefore look
        like:

          (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
           warning,
           'interface down while interface admin state is up')

        There is a clear separation between updates on the alarm from
        the underlying resource, like clear, and updates from an
        operator like acknowledge or closing an alarm:

          (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
           warning,
           'interface down while interface admin state is up',
           cleared,
           closed)

        Administrative actions like removing closed alarms older than a
        given time is supported.

        This alarm module does not define how the underlying
        instrumentation detects and clears the specific alarms.  That
        belongs to the SDO or enterprise that owns that specific
        technology.

        The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
        NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',
        'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
        they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

         "This type is used to match resources of type 'resource'.
          Since the type 'resource' is a union of different types, the
          'resource-match' type is also a union of corresponding types.

          If the type is given as an XPath 1.0 expression, a resource of
          type 'instance-identifier' matches if the instance is part of
          the node set that is the result of evaluating the XPath 1.0
          expression.  For example, the XPath 1.0 expression:

           /ietf-interfaces:interfaces/ietf-interfaces:interface
               [ietf-interfaces:type='ianaift:ethernetCsmacd']

          would match the resource instance-identifier:

          assuming that the interface 'eth1' is of type
          'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'.

          If the type is given as an object identifier, a resource of
          type 'object-identifier' matches if the match object
          identifier is a prefix of the resource's object identifier.
          For example, the value:

           1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2

          would match the resource object identifier:

           1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.5

          If the type is given as an UUID or a string, it is interpreted
          as an XML Schema regular expression, which matches a resource
          of type 'yang:uuid' or 'string' if the given regular
          expression matches the resource string.

          If the type is given as an XPath expression it is evaluated
          in the following XPath context:

               the namespace is as defined by the 'namespace' statement
               in the YANG module.

               If a leaf of this type is encoded in XML, all namespace
               declarations in scope on the leaf element are added to

7.  X.733 Extensions

   Many alarm systems are based on the X.733, [X.733], and X.736 [X.736]
   alarm standards.  This module augments the alarm inventory, the alarm
   lists and the alarm notification with X.733 and X.736 parameters.

   The module also supports a feature whereby the alarm manager can
   configure the mapping from alarm types to X.733 "event-type" and
   "probable-cause" parameters.  This might be needed when the default
   mapping provided by the system is in conflict with other management
   systems or not considered correct.

   Note that the IETF Alarm Module term "resource" is synonymous to the
   ITU term "managed object".

     description
       "This module augments the ietf-alarms module with X.733 alarm
        parameters.

        The following structures are augmented with X.733 event type
        and probable cause:

         1) alarms/alarm-inventory: all possible alarm types
         2) alarms/alarm-list: every alarm in the system
         3) alarm-notification: notifications indicating alarm state
            changes
         4) alarms/shelved-alarms

        The module also optionally allows the alarm management system
        to configure the mapping from the IETF Alarm module alarm keys
        to the ITU tuple (event-type, probable-cause).

        The mapping does not include a corresponding X.733 specific
        problem value. The recommendation is to use the
        'alarm-type-qualifier' leaf which serves the same purpose.

        The module uses an integer and a corresponding string for
        probable cause instead of a globally defined enumeration, in
        order to be able to manage conflicting enumeration definitions.
        A single globally defined enumeration is challenging to
        maintain.

        The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
        NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',
        'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
        they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


   The list of alarms itself may be potentially sensitive from a
   security perspective, in that it potentially gives an attacker an
   authoritative picture of the (broken) state of the network.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /alarms/control/notify-status-changes:  This leaf controls whether an
      alarm should notify based on various state changes.  Unauthorized
      access to this leaf could have a negative impact on operational
      procedures relying on fine-grained alarm state change reporting

   /alarms/control/alarm-shelving/shelf:  This list controls the
      shelving (blocking) of alarms.  Unauthorized access to this list
      could jeopardize the alarm management procedures since these
      alarms will not be notified and not be part of the alarm list.

   /alarms/control/alarm-profile/alarm-severity-assignment-profile:
      This list controls the severity levels of an alarm.  Unauthorized
      access to this could for example downgrade the severity of an
      alarm and thereby have a negative impact on the alarm monitoring
      process.

   Some of the operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /alarms/alarm-list/purge-alarms:  This action deletes alarms from the
      alarm list.  Unauthorized use of this action could jeopardize the
      alarm management procedures since the deleted alarms may be vital
      for the alarm management application.

   /alarms/alarm-list/alarm/set-operator-state:  This action can be used
      by the operator to indicate the level of human intervention on an
      alarm.  Unauthorized use of this action could result in alarms
      being ignored by operators.

Appendix A.  Vendor-specific Alarm Types Example

   This example shows how to define alarm types in a vendor-specific
   module.  In this case the vendor "xyz" has chosen to define top level
   identities according to X.733 event types.

   This shows an alarm inventory, it shows one alarm type defined only
   with the identifier, and another dynamically configured.  In the
   latter case a digital input has been connected to a smoke-detector,
   therefore the "alarm-type-qualifier" is set to "smoke-detector" and
   the "alarm-type-id" to "environmental-alarm".

   The evolution of the definition of alarm moves from focused on events
   reporting a deviation from normal operation towards a definition to a
   undesired *state* which *requires an operator action*.

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


F.2.  Data model

   This section describes how this YANG alarm module relates to other
   standard data models.  Note well that we cover other data models for
   alarm interfaces.  Not other standards such as SDO specific alarms
   for example.

F.2.1.  X.733

   X.733 has acted as a base for several alarm data models over the
   year.  The YANG alarm module differs in the following ways:

      X.733 models the alarm list as a list of notifications.  The YANG
      alarm module defines the alarm list as the current alarm states
      for the resources, which is generated from the state change
      reporting notifications.

      In X.733 an alarm can have the severity level clear.  In the YANG
      alarm module "clear" is not a severity level, it is a separate
      state of the alarm.  An alarm can have the following states for
      example (major, cleared), (minor, not cleared)

      X.733 uses a flat globally defined enumerated "probable-cause" to
      identify alarm types.  This alarm module uses a hierarchical YANG
      identity, "alarm-type".  This enables delegation of alarm types
      within organizations.  It also lets management reason about
      abstract alarm types corresponding to base identities, see
      Section 3.2.

      The YANG alarm module has not included the majority of the X.733
      alarm attributes.  Rather these are defined in an augmenting
      module if "strict" X.733 compliance is needed.

F.2.2.  RFC 3877, the Alarm MIB

   The MIB in RFC 3877 takes a different approach, rather than defining
   a concrete data model for alarms, it defines a model to map existing
   SNMP managed objects and notifications into alarm states and alarm
   notifications.  This was necessary since MIBs were already defined
   with both managed objects and notifications indicating alarms, for
   example linkUp and linkDown notifications in combination with
   ifAdminState and ifOperState.  So RFC 3877 can not really be compared
   to the alarm YANG module in that sense.

   The Alarm MIB maps existing MIB definitions into alarms,
   alarmModelTable.  The upside of that is that a SNMP Manager can at
   runtime read the possible alarm types.  This corresponds to the
   alarmInventory in the alarm YANG module.

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module                 April 2019


F.2.3.  3GPP Alarm IRP

   The 3GPP Alarm IRP is an evolution of X.733.  Main differences
   between the alarm YANG module and 3GPP are:

      3GPP keeps the majority of the X.733 attributes, the alarm YANG
      module does not.

      3GPP introduced overlapping and possibly conflicting keys for
      alarms, alarmId and (managed object, event type, probable cause,
      specific problem).  (See Annex C in [X.733] Example 3).  In the
      YANG alarm module the key for identifying an alarm instance is
      clearly defined by ("resource", "alarm-type-id", "alarm-type-
      qualifier").  See also Section 3.4 for more information.

      The alarm YANG module clearly separates the resource/
      instrumentation life cycle from the operator life cycle. 3GPP
      allows operators to set the alarm severity to clear, this is not
      allowed by this module, rather an operator closes an alarm which
      does not affect the severity.

F.2.4.  G.7710

   G.7710 is different than the previous referenced alarm standards.  It
   does not define a data model for alarm reporting.  It defines common
   equipment management function requirements including alarm
   instrumentation.  The scope is transport networks.

   The requirements in G.7710 corresponds to features in the alarm YANG
   module in the following way:

      Alarm Severity Assignment Profile (ASAP): the alarm profile
      "/alarms/alarm-profile/".

      Alarm Reporting Control (ARC): alarm shelving "/alarms/control/
      alarm-shelving/" and the ability to control alarm notifications
      "/alarms/control/notify-status-changes".  Alarm shelving
      corresponds to the use case of turning off alarm reporting for a
      specific resource, the NALM state in M.3100.

Appendix G.  Alarm Usability Requirements

   This section defines usability requirements for alarms.  Alarm
   usability is important for an alarm interface.  A data model will
   help in defining the format but if the actual alarms are of low value
   we have not gained the goal of alarm management.

                  Table 5: Acceptable Alarm Rates, Burst

   The numbers in Table 4 and Table 5 are the sum of all alarms for a
   network being managed from one alarm console.  So every individual
   system or NMS contributes to these numbers.

   Vendors SHOULD make sure that the following rules are used in
   designing the alarm interface:

   1.  Rationalize the alarms in the system to ensure that every alarm
       is necessary, has a purpose, and follows the cardinal rule - that
       it requires an operator response.  Adheres to the rules of
       Table 3

   2.  Audit the quality of the alarms.  Talk with the operators about
       how well the alarm information support them.  Do they know what
       to do in the event of an alarm?  Are they able to quickly
       diagnose the problem and determine the corrective action?  Does
       the alarm text adhere to the requirements in Table 3?

   3.  Analyze and benchmark the performance of the system and compare
       it to the recommended metrics in Table 4 and Table 5.  Start by
       identifying nuisance alarms, standing alarms at normal state and
       startup.
