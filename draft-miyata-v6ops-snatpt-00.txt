Abstract

   This document specifies an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism to 
   provide accessibility for IPv6 node to IPv4 node, and vice-versa.
   The goal of this document is not providing the most fundamental 
   technology which could works well with additional technology.
   We used to have an technology called NAT-PT[RFC2766]. NAT-PT was 
   designed to work with problematic DNS Application Level Gateway. So,
   it was changed to historical state by [RFC4966].
   This document attempts to simplify NAT-PT specification, removing 
   dependability on Application Layer Gateway as well as resolving
   problems pointed in [RFC4966].

1. Introduction

   Disclaimer:
   This proposal is incomplete.  It is posted to seek comments on
   plausibility and to represent the approach how to simplify the NAT-PT
   which was mixed up with ALGs.

   IPv6 is a new version of the Internet Protocol(IP) designed to 
   improve IPv4 to allow for future Internet growth. 
   Recently, it is predicted that the IPv4 address would be run out in
   several years and IPv6 would be deployed.
   On the other hand, IPv4 has been maintained to extend its lifetime. 
   So, the transition period is predicted to be long. During the period,
   IPv6 node need to co-exist with IPv4 node.
   During the period, there would be some node which can use only IPv4
   (IPv4 Only Node) as well as node which can use only IPv6(IPv6 Only
   Node). And they will need to communicate.
   So, the translation technology is required.


   There are some standarized translation technologies, 
   "Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"(SIIT)[RFC2765] and 
   "An IPv6-to-IPv4 Transport Relay Translator"(TRT)[RFC3142].

   SIIT has a big advantage that does not require to maintain the 
   session state in Translator Box.
   But SIIT is designed to be used by small IPv6 network. And it 
   requires IPv6 host to implement functionalities to be assinged 
   IPv4 address.


   TRT has simple architecture and it does not require any modification
   for both IPv6 and IPv4 host.
   But TRT Translatoion Box is designed to translate in transport layer.
   To provide communication between IPv6 Only Node and IPv4 Only Node, 
   it establishs two sessions, one is with IPv6 Only Node, another is 



Miyata                   Expires August 1, 2008                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   with IPv4 Only Node. So it is costful. Also it is designed to provide
   only TCP sessions initiated by IPv6 Only Node.

   NAT-PT was designed to provide both TCP and UDP communications. 
   Also it attempted to provide communications initiated by both IPv6 
   Only Node and IPv4 Only Node.
   NAT-PT does not require IPv6 node and IPv4 node to implement special
   functionalities to communicate via Translation Box.
   In 2007 it was depricated by some reasons described in [RFC4966].
   But its basic and simple translation behavior is helpful for some
   situations, which does not expect perfect translation.

   This documents attmept to recycle NAT-PT specification removing
   dependability on specific application and resolving some issues 
   listed in [RFC4966].


2. Terminology

   The majority of terms used in this document are borrowed almost as is
   from [RFC2663]. The following lists terms specific to this document.

2.1 Network Address Translation (NAT)

   The term NAT in this document is very similar to the IPv4 NAT
   described in [RFC2663], but is not identical. IPv4 NAT translates
   one IPv4 address into another IPv4 address. In this document, NAT
   refers to translation of an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address and
   vice versa.

   While the IPv4 NAT [RFC2663] provides routing between private IPv4 
   and external IPv4 address realms, NAT in this document provides 
   routing between a IPv6 address realm and an external IPv4 address 
   realm.

2.2 NAT-PT flavors

   Just as there are various flavors identified with IPv4 NAT in 
   [RFC2663], the following NAT-PT variations may be identified in this
   document.

2.2.1 Traditional NAT-PT

   Traditional-NAT-PT would allow hosts within a IPv6 network to access
   hosts in the IPv4 network. In a traditional-NAT-PT, sessions are uni-
   directional, outbound from the IPv6 network.  This is in contrast 
   with Bi-directional-NAT-PT, which permits sessions in both inbound 
   and outbound directions.



Miyata                   Expires August 1, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   Just as with IPv4 traditional-NAT, there are two variations to
   traditional-NAT-PT, namely Basic-NAT-PT and NAPT-PT.
   
   With Basic-NAT-PT, a block of IPv4 addresses are set aside for
   translating addresses of IPv6 hosts as they originate sessions to the
   IPv4 hosts in external domain. For packets outbound from the IPv6 
   domain, the source IP address and related fields such as IP, TCP, UDP
   and ICMP header checksums are translated.  For inbound packets, the
   destination IP address and the checksums as listed above are
   translated.

   NAPT-PT extends the notion of translation one step further by also
   translating transport identifier (e.g., TCP and UDP port numbers,
   ICMP query identifiers). This allows the transport identifiers of a
   number of IPv6 hosts to be multiplexed into the transport identifiers
   of a single mapped IPv4 address. NAPT-PT allows a set of IPv6 hosts
   to share a single IPv4 address. Note that NAPT-PT can be combined 
   with Basic-NAT-PT so that a pool of external addresses are used in
   conjunction with port translation.

   For packets outbound from the IPv6 network, NAPT-PT would translate 
   the source IP address, source transport identifier and related fields
   such as IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP header checksums. Transport identifier
   can be one of TCP/UDP port or ICMP query ID. For inbound packets, the
   destination IP address, destination transport identifier and the IP
   and transport header checksums are translated.

2.2.2  Bi-Directional-NAT-PT

   With Bi-directional-NAT-PT, sessions can be initiated from hosts in
   IPv4 network as well as the IPv6 network. IPv6 network addresses are
   bound to IPv4 addresses statically or dynamically.
   For dynamic address binding Application Level Gateway(ALG)[RFC2663]
   is required. 
   There should be various kinds of ALG. The detail specification of ALG
   is out of scope of this document.


2.3 Protocol Translation (PT)

   PT in this document refers to the translation of an IPv4 packet into
   a semantically equivalent IPv6 packet and vice versa.  Protocol
   translation details are described in [RFC2765].


2.4 Application Level Gateway (ALG)

   ALG is an application specific agent that allows a IPv6 node to 



Miyata                   Expires August 1, 2008                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   communicate with a IPv4 node and vice versa. 
   Some applications carry network addresses in payloads. But NAT-PT is
   application unaware and does not snoop the payload. ALG would snoop 
   the payload to modify and configure the NAT-PT gateway dynamically if
   required.
   ALG could work in conjunction with NAT-PT to provide support for many
   kind of such applications.


2.5 Dummy Prefix

   The IPv6 Prefix to map IPv4 address to IPv6 address. And the length 
   is 96 bit.
   In this document Dummy Prefix is represented as PREFIX or PREFIX::/96
   when IPv6 address or prefix is described.
   The prefix PREFIX::/96 is advertised in the IPv6 network by the
   NAT-PT gateway, and packets addressed to this PREFIX will be routed 
   to the NAT-PT gateway. The pre-configured PREFIX only needs to be 
   routable within the IPv6 network and as such it can be any routable 
   prefix that the network administrator chooses.


2.6 Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3. Conceptual Model

   This document attempts to separate ALGs form NAT-PT gateway 
   logically as described in Fig. 3.1.
   NAT-PT gateway and ALG can colocate physically.
   Some ALG can be implemented in Translation Engine if required.

   This chapter makes use of internal conceptual variables to describe
   the behavior of NAT-PT gateway.
   The specific variable names are just an example. An implementation is
   not required to have them in the exact form described here, so long 
   as its external behavior is consistent with that described in this
   document.

   One of the most important point here is that "Address Mapping Table" 
   and "Translation Rule Table" is the most fundamental point that 
   define the behavior how to translate the packet regardless how the 
   entries are generated.

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   Another point is that the NAT-PT gateway MUST maintain the address
   mapping, translation rule or session status to recycle the IPv4 
   address and TCP/UDP ports. Also, to send ICMP Error Messages to
   appropriate destination, the information of translated session is 
   important to map the destination address.

3.1 Address Mapping Table

   To translate the packet, An IPv4 address must be mapped to an IPv6 
   address regardless the direction of the session.
   So, the address mapping must be defined in this table.

   This table must have following informations.

   IPv6 Address
      The IPv6 address to which IPv4 address be mapped.

   IPv4 Address
      The IPv4 address which is mapped to above IPv6 address.
      If the Translation Type of correspondent entry is NAPT-PT, the
      specified address can be shared with other entry.

   Translation Type
      The type of translation must be defined. 
      e.g., NAPT-PT or NAT-PT

   Stability
      The stability type of this mapping. This is used for recycle 
      purpose. This value specifies this mapping is "static" or 
      "dynamic". If it is mapped dynamically, and there are no session
      entry on "Session Status Table" associated to this entry for a 
      while, the entry and associated entry in "Translation Rule Table" 
      MUST be removed for recycle purpose.


3.2 Translation Rule Table

   The NAT-PT gateway needs to know how to handle the packet. So, this
   table defines the rule what kind of packet must be handled in what 
   kind of manner. 

   This table must have following informations.

   Address Mapping Table Entry
      The entry number of Address Mapping Table which is used by this
      entry.

   Direction
      The allowed direction of session initiation is defined.
      e.g., 
         IPv6-to-IPv4 (IPv6 node initiate the session)
         IPv4-to-IPv6 (IPv4 node initiate the session)
         Bi-dir       (Bi-direction)

   IPv6 Address
      The IPv6 address of end-node which can use this entry.
      If the Direction value of correspondent entry is IPv6-to-IPv4, the
      address can be specified by range as well as wildcard.
      e.g.,
         2001:DB8:b:a::/64
         2001:DB8:b:a:1234:5678:9abc:def0/128
         any

   IPv4 Address
      The IPv4 address of end-node which can use this entry. 
      If the Direction value of correspondent entry is IPv4-to-IPv6, the
      address can be specified by range as well as wildcard.
      e.g.,
         192.0.2.0/24
         192.0.2.4/32
         any

   Protocol
      The Protocol which is allowed to translate.
      e.g., 
         TCP, UDP, ICMP


3.3 Session Status Table

   The entries of this table MUST be generated dynamically when the 
   session is initiated. And it MUST be maintained and removed according
   to the session status.
   The correspondent session entry is generated after examining the
   "Translation Rule Table", if the session is allowed.

   In TCP session:
      The entry is generated by SYN packet. The entry is deleted when
      session is closed.
   In UDP session:
      The entry is generated by first packet. The entry is deleted after
      pre-configured time from last packet.

   Protocol
      The protocol of this entry. 
      e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP

   IPv6 Node
      The IPv6 address of IPv6 side end node of correspondent session.
      It can not be specified by range or wildcard.

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   IPv4 Node
      The IPv4 address of IPv4 side end node of correspondent session.
      It can not be specified by range or wildcard.

   Port on IPv6 Node
      The Port number of TCP or UDP, which is used on IPv6 side end node
      for this session.

   Port on IPv4 Node
      The Port number of TCP or UDP, which is used on IPv4 side end node
      for this session.

   Mapped IPv6 Address
      The address which is mapped to the address specified in 
      "IPv4 Node" field. It must be the synthesis address.
      The packet addressed to this address MUST be routed to the NAT-PT
      gateway. 

   Mapped IPv4 Address
      The address which is mapped to the address specified in 
      "IPv6 Node" field. 
      The packet addressed to this address MUST be routed to the NAT-PT 
      gateway. 

   Port on Gateway IPv6 Side
      The Port number of TCP or UDP, which is used on NAT-PT gateway 
      for this session on IPv6 side.

   Port on Gateway IPv4 Side
      The Port number of TCP or UDP, which is used on NAT-PT gateway 
      for this session on IPv4 side.

   Remaining Time
      Typically in UDP session, the entry MUST be removed when it is not
      in use. This field stores the remaining time for its expiration.
      After each packet translation, NAT-PT gateway must reset to the
      pre-configured value. The value MUST be decreased by aging method.


3.4 Configuration Interface

   "Address Mapping Table" and "Translation Rule Table" MUST be 
   configured
   statically or dynamically.
   So, the configuration Interface is required.
   The administrator would configure static rule. So, the User Interface
   (A.K.A. GUI, CUI) would be used.
   Some kinds of ALG, (e.g.. DNS-ALG, FTP-ALG) would generate dynamic

   rule, so the interface to set the rules are required.

   The Interface is TBD


4. Dummy Prefix Definition

   Each NAT-PT gateway MUST be pre-configured a Dummy Prefix. The Dummy
   Prefix assigned to individual NAT-PT gateway MUST be unique. The
   uniqueness MUST be guaranteed within the IPv6 network they attached.
   Backup model and Load balance model is out of scope of this document.
   The packet addressed to the synthesis IPv6 address MUST arrive to the
   associated NAT-PT gateway.

   The format is described in Fig. 3.1.

   The length of Dummy Prefix is 96-bit. The top 64-bit is a routable
   unicast prefix of IPv6. Any prefix can be assigned by the 
   administrator from the address space he/her is administrating as far
   as it is not assigned.

   The following 32-bit, represented as IDENT MUST be an value assigned
   by IANA to indicate that translator would exist in the path.
   More requirement for IDENT is described in Chapter 13.

   The Dummy Prefix MUST be followed by encoded IPv4 address.


5. NAT-PT Operation 

   NAT-PT offers a straight forward solution based on transparent
   routing [RFC2663] and address/protocol translation, allowing a large
   number of applications in IPv6 and IPv4 realms to inter-operate 
   without requiring any changes to these applications.

5.1 Traditional NAT-PT (IPv6 to IPv4)

   In the following paragraphs we describe the operation of
   traditional-NAT-PT and the way that connections can be initiated from
   a host in IPv6 domain to a host in IPv4 domain through a
   traditional-NAT-PT


5.1.1 Basic NAT-PT Operation

          (IPv6-B)-+
                   |                  +==============+
          (IPv6-A)-+-(NAT-PT)---------| IPv4 network |--(IPv4-C)
                        |             +==============+
                 (pool of IPv4 addresses)

                     Figure 4.1: IPv6 to IPv4 communication
           Node IPv6-A has an IPv6 address -> 2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210
           Node IPv6-B has an IPv6 address -> 2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3211
           Node IPv4-C has an IPv4 address -> 192.0.2.12

   NAT-PT has a pool of addresses including the IPv4 subnet
   10.0.0.0/24

   The IPv4 addresses in the address pool could be allocated one-to-one
   to the IPv6 addresses of the IPv6 end nodes in which case one needs
   as many IPv4 addresses as IPv6 end points. In this document we assume 
   that the IPv6 network has less IPv4 addresses than IPv6 end nodes and 
   thus dynamic address allocation is required for at least some of 
   them.

   Say the IPv6 Node IPv6-A wants to communicate with the IPv4 Node 
   IPv4-C.
   IPv6-A creates a packet with:

      Source Address, SA=2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210 and Destination
      Address, DA = PREFIX::192.0.2.12

   The packet is routed via the NAT-PT gateway, where it is translated
   to IPv4.

   If the outgoing packet is not a session initialisation packet, the
   NAT-PT SHOULD already have stored some state about the related
   session, including mapped IPv4 address and other parameters for the
   translation.  If this state does not exist, the packet SHOULD be
   silently discarded.

   If the packet is a session initialisation packet, the NAT-PT locally



Miyata                   Expires August 1, 2008                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   allocates an address (e.g: 10.0.0.10) from its pool of addresses and
   the packet is translated to IPv4. The translation parameters are
   cached for the duration of the session and the IPv6 to IPv4 mapping 
   is retained by NAT-PT.

   The resulting IPv4 packet has SA=10.0.0.10 and DA=192.0.2.12.
   Any returning traffic will be recognised as belonging to the same
   session by NAT-PT. NAT-PT will use the state information to translate
   the packet, and the resulting addresses will be
   SA=PREFIX::192.0.2.12, DA=2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210. Note that this
   packet can now be routed inside the IPv6-only stub network as normal.


5.1.2 NAPT-PT Operation

   NAPT-PT, which stands for "Network Address Port Translation +
   Protocol Translation", would allow IPv6 nodes to communicate with the
   IPv4 nodes transparently using a single IPv4 address. The TCP/UDP 
   ports of the IPv6 nodes are translated into TCP/UDP ports of the 
   registered IPv4 address.

   While NAT-PT support is limited to TCP, UDP and other port
   multiplexing type of applications, NAPT-PT solves a problem that is
   inherent with NAT-PT. That is, NAT-PT would fall flat when the pool
   of IPv4 addresses mapped for translation purposes is exhausted. 
   Once the address pool is exhausted, newer IPv6 nodes cannot establish
   sessions with the outside world anymore. NAPT-PT, on the other hand,
   will allow for a maximum of 63K TCP and 63K UDP sessions per IPv4
   address before having no TCP and UDP ports left to map.

   To modify the example sited in figure 4.1, we could have NAPT-PT on 
   the border router (instead of NAT-PT) and all IPv6 addresses could be
   mapped to a single IPv4 address 10.0.0.10.

   IPv6 Node IPv6-A would establish a TCP session with the IPv4 Node 
   IPv4-C as follows:

   IPv6-A creates a packet with:

   Source Address, SA=2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210 , source TCP port = 3017 
   and Destination Address, DA = PREFIX::192.0.2.12, destination TCP
   port = 23.

   When the packet reaches the NAPT-PT box, NAPT-PT would map one of
   the TCP ports from the mapped IPv4 address to translate the tuple 
   of (Source Address, Source TCP port) as follows:





Miyata                   Expires August 1, 2008                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


      SA=10.0.0.10, source TCP port = 1025  and
      DA=192.0.2.12, destination TCP port = 23.

   The returning traffic from 192.0.2.12, TCP port 23 will be recognized
   as belonging to the same session and will be translated
   back to IPv6 as follows:

      SA = PREFIX::192.0.2.12, source TCP port = 23;
      DA = 2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210 , destination TCP port = 3017

   Inbound NAPT-PT sessions are restricted to one server per service,
   mapped via static TCP/UDP port mapping. For example, IPv6-A in figure
   4.1 may be the only HTTP server (port 80) in the IPv6 domain. IPv4-C
   sends a packet:

      SA=192.0.2.12, source TCP port = 1025  and
      DA=10.0.0.10, destination TCP port = 80

   NAPT-PT will translate this packet to:

      SA=PREFIX::192.0.2.12, source TCP port = 1025
      DA=2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210, destination TCP port = 80

   In the above example, note that all sessions which reach NAPT-PT with
   a destination port of 80 will be redirected to the same node IPv6-A.
   

5.2 Bi-Directional-NAT-PT

   To provide incoming session, IPv4 address MUST be mapped one-to-one
   to IPv6 address. The mapping could be either statically or 
   dynamically.
   In this section the description is based on the situation that
   mapped address and translation rule are already configured.

   NAT-PT has a pool of addresses including the IPv4 subnet 10.0.0.0/24.

   Say the IPv4-C wants to communicate with the IPv6-A.  
   Somehow 10.0.0.10 is mapped to the IPv6-A, and IPv4-C knows the 
   mapped address. (ALG is expected to map the address and inform the 
   address to IPv4-C dynamically.)
   Then, the IPv4-C creates a packet with:

      Source Address, SA=192.0.2.12        and 
      Destination Address, DA = 10.0.0.10

   The packet is routed via the NAT-PT gateway, where it is translated
   to IPv6.

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008




   If the incoming packet is not a session initialisation packet, the
   NAT-PT SHOULD already have stored some state about the related
   session, including mapped IPv4 address and other parameters for the
   translation.  If this state does not exist, the packet SHOULD be
   silently discarded.

   If the packet is a session initialisation packet, the NAT-PT locally
   search the IPv6 address associated to 10.0.0.10 
   (2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210) from its "Address Mapping Table" and the 
   packet is translated to IPv6. The translation parameters are cached 
   for the duration of the session and the IPv6 to IPv6 mapping is
   retained by NAT-PT.

   The resulting IPv6 packet has SA=PREFIX::192.0.2.12 and 
   DA=2001:DB8:b:a::7654:3210.
   Any returning traffic will be recognised as belonging to the same
   session by NAT-PT. NAT-PT will use the state information to translate
   the packet, and the resulting addresses will be as follows.
   SA=10.0.0.10, DA=192.0.2.12. 


6. IPv6 Address mapping

   An IPv6 address MUST be mapped to an IPv4 address by prepending
   Dummy Prefix to the IPv4 address.
   The format MUST be as [PREFIX]::[IPv4 address].
   The address can be automatically calculated.


7. IPv4 Address mapping

   IPv4 address mapping can be done by either statically or dynamically.
   To map dynamically some ALGs are required.
   The ALG could be DNS-ALG, SIP-ALG, FTP-ALG etc...
   The specification of ALG is various, it depends on application.
   This document is attempting to remove the dependency on specific 
   application. So the specifications of ALGs are out of scope of this
   document.

   The borderline between ALG and NAT-PT gateway is "Address Mapping
   Table" and "Translation Rule Table".

   This documents describes the behavior after the entry in both tables
   are set.
   For the NAT-PT gateway, the behavior for both static entry and 
   dynamic one are almost same.

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   Only the difference is expiration of the entry based on the value of
   Stability field of "Address Mapping Table".
   If the value of Stability field indicate Dynamic, the entries in
   these tables MUST be maintained as described in chapter 3.


8. Protocol Translation Details

   The IPv4 and ICMPv4 headers are similar to their IPv6 counterparts 
   but a number of field are either missing, have different meaning or
   different length. NAT-PT SHOULD translate all IP/ICMP headers from 
   IPv4 to IPv6 and vice versa in order to make end-to-end IPv6 to IPv4
   communication possible. Due to the address translation function and
   possible port multiplexing, NAT-PT SHOULD also make appropriate
   adjustments to the upper layer protocol (TCP/UDP) headers. Some
   application requires ALG to complete its communication. FTP-ALG, for
   example, would make to FTP payload as an FTP packet traverses from
   IPv4 to IPv6 realm or vice versa. But any kind of ALG is out of scope
   of this document.

   Protocol Translation details are described in [RFC2765], but there 
   are some modifications required to SIIT because of the fact that 
   NAT-PT also performs Network Address Translation.


8.1 Translating IPv4 headers to IPv6 headers

   This is done exactly the same as in SIIT apart from the following
   fields:

      Source Address:
         The low-order 32 bits is the IPv4 source address. The high-
         order 96 bits is the designated PREFIX for all IPv4
         communications. Addresses using this PREFIX will be routed
         to the NAT-PT gateway (PREFIX::/96)

      Destination Address:
         NAT-PT retains a mapping between the IPv4 destination
         address and the IPv6 address of the destination node. The
         IPv4 destination address is replaced by the IPv6 address
         retained in that mapping.


8.2 Translating IPv6 headers to IPv4 headers

   This is done exactly the same as in SIIT apart from the Source
   Address which should be determined as follows:




Miyata                   Expires August 1, 2008                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


      Source Address:
         The NAT-PT retains a mapping between the IPv6 source address
         and a mapped IPv4 address. The IPv6 source address is replaced
         by the IPv4 address retained in that mapping.

      Destination Address:
         The original IPv6 packets that are translated have a 
         destination address of the form PREFIX::IPv4/96. Thus the 
         low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 destination address is copied to
         the IPv4 destination address.


8.3 TCP/UDP/ICMP Checksum Update

   NAT-PT retains mapping between IPv6 address and an IPv4 address. This
   mapping is used in the translation of packets that go through NAT-PT
   gateway.

   The following sub-sections describe TCP/UDP/ICMP checksum update
   procedure in NAT-PT, as packets are translated from IPv4 to IPv6 and 
   vice versa.


8.3.1 TCP/UDP/ICMP Checksum Update from IPv4 to IPv6

   UDP checksums, when set to a non-zero value, and TCP checksum SHOULD
   be recalculated to reflect the address change from IPv4 to IPv6. The
   incremental checksum adjustment algorithm may be borrowed from 
   [RFC3022].
   In the case of NAPT-PT, TCP/UDP checksum should be adjusted to
   account for the address and TCP/UDP port changes, going from IPv4 to
   IPv6 address.

   When the checksum of a IPv4 UDP packet is set to zero, NAT-PT MUST
   evaluate the checksum in its entirety for the IPv6-translated UDP
   packet. If a IPv4 UDP packet with a checksum of zero arrives in
   fragments, NAT-PT MUST await all the fragments until they can be
   assembled into a single non-fragmented packet and evaluate the
   checksum prior to forwarding the translated IPv6 UDP packet.

   ICMPv6, unlike ICMPv4, uses a pseudo-header, just like UDP and TCP
   during checksum computation. As a result, when the ICMPv6 header
   checksum is computed [RFC2765], the checksum needs to be adjusted to
   account for the additional pseudo-header. 

   Note, there may also be adjustments required to the checksum due to 
   changes in the source and destination addresses (and changes in 
   TCP/UDP/ICMP identifiers in the case of NAPT-PT) of the payload 
   carried within ICMP.

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


8.3.2 TCP/UDP/ICMP Checksum Update from IPv6 to IPv4

   TCP and UDP checksums SHOULD be recalculated to reflect the address
   change from IPv6 to IPv4. The incremental checksum adjustment 
   algorithm may be borrowed from [RFC3022]. In the case of NAPT-PT, 
   TCP/UDP checksums should be adjusted to account for the address and 
   TCP/UDP port changes, going from IPv6 to IPv4 addresses. For UDP 
   packets, optionally, the checksum may simply be changed to zero.

   The checksum calculation for a IPv4 ICMP header needs to be derived
   from the IPv6 ICMP header by running the checksum adjustment 
   algorithm [RFC3022] to remove the IPv6 pseudo header from the 
   computation. 
   Note, the adjustment must additionally take into account changes to 
   the checksum as a result of updates to the source and destination
   addresses (and transport ports in the case of NAPT-PT) made to the
   payload carried within ICMP.


8.4 ICMP translation

   The ICMP translation is described in [RFC2765], It is based on 
   previous RFC for ICMPv6[RFC2463]. And it is obsoleted by [RFC4443].
   So the description of ICMP translation needs to be revised.


8.4.1 ICMP translation from IPv4 to IPv6

   TBD


8.4.2 ICMP translation from IPv6 to IPv4

   TBD


9. Host Implementation

   This specification does not require any additional function to use
   NAT-PT gateway. So current existing IPv6 devices can use NAT-PT
   gateway. However, if IPv6 devices implement some functionality  
   it can resolve some issues listed on [RFC4966].
   e.g., Client application can display dialog to indicate users that
         the there is a translator in the path.
         Server application detect the existence of translator in the
         path. Then it can select the behavior according to the 
         pre-defined policy.

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   The detail behavior should be described in higher version or 
   individual document.


10. Application Layer Gateway support

   Some applications contain IP address in payload of the packet to 
   initiate a new session. In such case, the translation rule should be 
   configured dynamically. 
   To allow this, ALG is required and the communication method between 
   ALG and NAT-PT gateway is required.
   NAT-PT gateway needs the information in both "Address Mapping Table"
   and "Translation Rule Table".
   
   The protocol between NAT-PT gateway and ALG is TBD.


11. NAT-PT Limitations and Future Work

   All limitations associated to NAT [RFC2663] are also associated to
   NAT-PT.  Here are the most important of them in detail, as well as
   some unique to NAT-PT.


11.1 Load Balance

   Once we separate ALGs from NAT-PT gateway, load balance is easily
   achieved. For smarter dynamic load balance, ALG and NAT-PT gateway 
   SHOULD have communication method to share the load of NAT-PT gateways
   as described in [mNATPT]. 
   Anyway the ALG will inform some informations to NAT-PT gateway to be
   stored in "Address Mapping Table" and "Translation Rule Table".
   The purpose of this document is describing the behavior after those
   informations have been set. So load balance is out of the scope of 
   this document.


11.2 Redundancy

   The router redundancy technology is defined in [RFC3768]. It is 
   called "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol"(VRRP).
   But it is not enough to provide redundancy, because NAT-PT gateway
   MUST maintain the state of each session and rule. 
   So, status synchronization technology would be required in addition
   to VRRP. 
   It is clear that the status synchronization technology MUST 
   synchronize the information in all of "Address Mapping Table",
   "Translation Rule Table" and "Session Status Table".



Miyata                   Expires August 1, 2008                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008


   So, the redundancy can be provide by extending sNAT-PT.
   But it is out of the scope of this document.


11.3 SCTP
   
   TBD


11.4 Topology limitations

   There are limitations to using the NAT-PT translation method. It is
   mandatory that all requests and responses pertaining to a session be
   routed via the same NAT-PT router. One way to guarantee this would be
   to have NAT-PT based on a border router that has unique Dummy Prefix 
   to a stub domain, where all IP packets are either originated from the
   domain or destined to the domain. 


11.5 Protocol Translation Limitations

   A number of IPv4 fields have changed meaning in IPv6 and translation
   is not straightforward. For example, the option headers semantics and
   syntax have changed significantly in IPv6.  Details of IPv4 to IPv6
   Protocol Translation can be found in [RFC2765].


11.6 Impact of Address Translation

   Since NAT-PT performs address translation, applications that carry
   the IP address in the higher layers will not work.  In this case
   Application Layer Gateways (ALG) need to be incorporated to provide
   support for those applications. This is a generic problem with NAT
   and it is fully described in [RFC2663].


11.7 Lack of end-to-end security

   One of the most important limitations of the NAT-PT proposal is the
   fact that end-to-end network layer security is not possible.  Also
   transport and application layer security may not be possible for
   applications that carry IP addresses to the application layer. This
   is an inherent limitation of the Network Address Translation
   function.

   Independent of NAT-PT, end-to-end IPSec security is not possible
   across different address realms. The two end-nodes that seek IPSec
   network level security must both support one of IPv4 or IPv6.

Internet-Draft                   sNAT-PT                   February 2008



11.8 Multicast Translation

   TBD


11.9 Twice NAT-PT

   Theoretically, it should work well.
   Further investigation should be done later. 


12. Applicability Statement

   NAT-PT is a very useful tool to provide communication between IPv6
   Only Node and IPv4 Only Node.
   
   When only the communication which IPv6 Only Node initiate is 
   required, NAPT-PT is useful because it requires few IPv4 address.

   When the communication need to be able to initiated by either IPv4 
   Only Node or IPv6 Only Node, Bi-Directional-NAT-PT is helpful. 

   When using Bi-Directional-NAT-PT, ALG is helpful.
   Some ALG can be implemented inside the Translation Engine(Fig. 3.1).
   Some ALG can be implemented outside the Translation Engine. Moreover
   it can be implemented outside the NAT-PT gateway.

   sNAT-PT is very basic functionality. So, it has some limitations when
   it works alone. But it can be combined with some other technologies.
   Some examples are briefly introduced in this document.


13. IANA Considerations

   The Dummy Prefix format is described in Fig. 3.1.
   The 32-bit, represented as IDENT in Fig. 3.1, MUST be the 
   value which indicates that this address is synthesis address.
   IANA has assigned FE under their OUI(00-00-5E) to indicate that an 
   IPv4 address is encoded in following 32-bit as represented in 
   Fig.3.2. 
   According to the definition, it could be used for NAT-PT technology 
   as the address contains the encoded IPv4 address.

   This address is used by ISATAP [RFC4214], one of tunneling 
   technologies.
   In RFC4966 it is stated that NAT-PT gateway existence in the path 
   must be detected by the end-node, so same address SHOULD not used 
   for NAT-PT. It is desired to assign another value to NAT-PT 
   technology.


14. Security Considerations

   Section 11.4 of this document states that end-to-end network and
   transport layer security are not possible when a session is
   intercepted by a NAT-PT.  Also application layer security may not be
   possible for applications that carry IP addresses in the application
   layer.

   Finally, all of the security considerations described in [RFC2663]
   are applicable to this document as well.
