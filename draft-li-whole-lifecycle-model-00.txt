Abstract 

   Dynamic composing Web Services provides an efficient mechanism to 
offer complex large systems. Substantial progress has already been 
made towards composing Web Services. Unfortunately, these approaches 
cannot build a model of the whole life cycle of composed Web Services. 
In order to solve this problem, this draft designed a whole life cycle model 
named Service-Cloud model based on the forming picture of clouds 
in nature. Service-Cloud model can describe the whole life cycle of the 
composed web Services: discovery, compose, publish, and terminate.

1. Introduction 

Unanticipated dynamic Web Services composition has increasing 
relevance in software today because of the constant change and 
evolution of technologies, protocols, and standards. It can be a 
very important mechanism for use in mission-critical, high availability,
and hard real-time E-commerce systems and anywhere else where there is
a need to perform unanticipated changes to software without discontinuing
its operation. Many e- and m-commerce systems fall into this category[1- 3].
Web services composition establishes on the Web Service architecture, and
it has become a key technology of enterprise level integration. The main
problem in Web service composition is how to flexibly compose the 
existing, autonomy services into the enterprise level applications. 
Alone with the development of Web service and correlated technologies, 
enterprise level service composition step by step transits to Web 
service composition which based on service oriented architecture. Then 
how to realize flexible enterprise service composition based on SOA 
becomes a problem urgent to be solved.
The real challenge in Web Services composition lies in how to provide a 

complete solution [4]. This means to develop a tool that supports the entire 
life cycle of service composition, i.e., discovery, consistency checking 
and composition in terms of reuse and extendibility. This draft based on [6,7]
proposes a whole life cycle of composed Web Services.

2. A whole life cycle of composed Web Services 

W3C provided a life cycle of Web Service [5], but dynamic composed 
Web Services are more complex than use pre-existing Web Services 
directly, and the courses of providing a composed Web Service are also 
different of providing a pre-existing Web Service. So, here based on 
the life cycle of Web Services in [5]. We present a whole life cycle of 
composed Web Services.There are two separate transition paths in [5]: 
service itself and request processing. A composed Web Service life cycle 
is mainly deferent in request processing, and the first one is the same 
as the expressions in [5]. A composed Web Service request processing 
expressed in the state transition diagrams below.
                              
                                   *--------*

                                  \ *--------*/
                                    | failed |

Figure 1. State Transition Diagram of Request Processing of A Composed 
Web service
States:
getReq: the provider agent has accepted a request to provide a service.
doReq: the provider agent does some process to fulfill the requests.
done: the provider agent successfully completed the requests and 
return the results to request agent.
failed: the provider agent encounter some errors and cannot fulfill the 
request, and return errors to request agent.
Transitions:
A composed service starts getReq when it accepts a request.
A composed service starts execution after it received a request.
A composed service transitions to either done or failed state depending 
on the outcome of the doReq stage. 
A composed service exits doReq from either done or failed state (which are 
mutually exclusive according to the previous transition).
Substrates transition diagram of doReq is given in figure 2.

States:
doSea: the provider agent is doing searching to fulfill the requests.
doComp: the provider agent is doing composition to fulfill the requests.
doChe: the provider agent is doing checking to meet the requests.
doPub: the provider agent is doing publication for reuse.
seaFail: the provider agent encountered a searching error and didn't 
complete the requested functions, returning a searching error to the 
request agent.
compFail: the provider agent encountered a composing error and didn't 
complete the composition, returning a composing error to the request 
agent.
cheFail: the provider agent encountered a checking error and didn't 
complete the requested functions, returning a checking error to the request 
agent.
pubFail: the provider agent encountered a publishing error and didn't 
complete the publication, returning a publishing error to the request 
agent.

Transitions:
A composed service starts execution doSea after it accepts a request.
 A composed service transitions to doComp, compFail, or doSea depending 
on the outcome of the doSea stage.
A composed service transitions to either doChe or compFail depending 
on the outcome of the doComp stage.
A composed service transitions to either doPub or cheFail depending on the 
outcome of the doChe stage.
A composed service exists doReq from doPub, failed, or  doSea state 
which are mutually exclusive.
