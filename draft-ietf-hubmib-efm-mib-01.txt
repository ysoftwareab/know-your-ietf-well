Abstract
   
   This document defines objects for managing Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities on Ethernet-like
   interfaces conformant to the Ethernet OAM functionality defined in
   [802.3ah].   The Ethernet OAM functionality is complementary to SNMP
   management in that it is focused on a small set of link-specific
   functions for Ethernet interfaces.  This document defines objects for
   controlling those link OAM functions, and on providing mechanisms to
   take status and input from Ethernet OAM and feed it into a larger
   TCP/IP network management system.

1. Introduction
   
   The IEEE 802.3ah Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) task force added
   new management capabilities to Ethernet like interfaces.  These
   management capabilities were introduced to provide some basic OAM
   function on Ethernet media.  The defined functionality includes
   discovery, error signaling, loopback, and link monitoring.  This memo
   defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use
   with network management protocols in the Internet community to manage
   these new EFM interface capabilities.   
   
   
2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework
   
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].
   
   
3. Overview
   
   Ethernet networks have evolved over the past 30 years from simple
   LANs to a variety of other applications, including wide area
   networks.  To address some of these emerging markets, the IEEE
   802.3ah task force defined additional clauses for the IEEE 802.3
   standard [802.3-2002] to better address Ethernet deployments in the
   public access network.  
   
   The Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) task force was focused on four 
   somewhat independent objectives to better address Ethernet access
   deployments: optics, copper, Ethernet passive optical networks
   (Ethernet PON, or EPON), and operations, administration, and
   maintenance (OAM).  The optics sub-taskforce developed new optical
   physical layers that better served the long-reach outside plant
   networks typically found in the access network, including developing
   physical layers that operate up to 20Km and supporting the
   environmental conditions of outside deployments.  The copper sub
   taskforce developed two new physical layers that run Ethernet
   natively over existing twisted pair wires that have been supporting
   voice services for decades.  The EPON sub-taskforce developed a new
   point-to-multipoint Ethernet physical layer, utilizing Ethernet
   framing natively over a time-division multiple-access (TDMA)
   infrastructure.  The OAM sub-taskforce introduced some basic
   management functionality into an Ethernet link to better monitor and
   maintain Ethernet networks in geographically disparate networks.  
   
   This document defines the management objects necessary to integrate
   Ethernet OAM functionality into the SNMP management framework.  
   
   Ethernet OAM is composed of a core set of functions and a set of
   optional functional groups that are not required to be implemented
   along with the core set.  The mandatory functions include discovery
   operations (determining if the other end of the link is OAM capable,
   and what OAM functions it implements), state machine implementation,
   and some critical event flows.  The optional functional groups are
   for (a) link events, (b) remote loopback, and (c) variable retrieval
   and response.  Each optional functional group is controlled by a
   separate MIB table(s).  
   
   Ethernet OAM is complementary, not competitive, with SNMP management
   in that it provides some basic management functions at layer two,


M. Squire              Expires - December 2004               [Page 3] 
                             EFM OAM MIB                    June 2004


   rather than using layer three and above as required by SNMP over an
   IP infrastructure.  Ethernet OAM provides single-hop functionality in
   that it works only between two directly connected Ethernet stations. 
   SNMP can be used to manage the Ethernet OAM interactions of one
   Ethernet station with another.  
   
   Ethernet OAM has three functional objectives which are detailed in
   the following sections.  
  
3.1 Remote fault indication  
  
   Remote fault indication provides a mechanism for one end of an
   Ethernet link to signal the other end that the receive path is non
   operational.  Some Ethernet physical layers offer mechanisms to
   signal this condition at the physical layer.  Ethernet OAM added a
   mechanism so that some Ethernet physical layers can operate in
   unidirectional mode, allowing frames to be transmitted in one
   direction even when the other direction is non-operational.  
   Traditionally, Ethernet PHYs do not allow frame transmission in one
   direction if the other direction is not operational.  Using this
   mode, Ethernet OAM allows frame-based signaling of remote fault
   conditions while still not allowing higher layer applications to be
   aware of the unidirectional capability.  This document includes
   mechanisms for capturing that information and reflecting such
   information in objects and notifications into the SNMP management
   framework.  
  
3.2 Link monitoring 
  
   Ethernet OAM includes event signaling capability so that one end of
   an Ethernet link can indicate the occurrence of certain important
   events to the other end of the link.  This happens via a layer two
   protocol.  This document defines methods for incorporating the
   occurrence of these layer two events, both at the local end and far
   end of the link, into the SNMP management framework.  
   
   Ethernet OAM also includes mechanisms for one Ethernet station to
   query another directly connected Ethernet station about the status of
   its Ethernet interface variables and status.  This document DOES NOT
   include mechanisms for controlling how one Ethernet endpoint may use
   this functionality to query the status or statistics of a peer
   Ethernet entity.  
  
3.3 Remote loopback
  
   Remote loopback is a link state where the peer Ethernet entity echoes
   every received packet (without modifications) back onto the link. 
   Remote loopback is intrusive in that the other end of the link is not
   forwarding traffic from higher layers out over the link.  This

                             EFM OAM MIB                    June 2004


   document defines objects controlling loopback operation and reading
   the status of the loopback state.  
   
   
4. Relation to the Other MIBs
   
   The definitions presented here are based on Clauses 30 and 57 of
   [802.3ah].  Note that these clauses describe many of these variables
   and their affects on the MAC layer.  In some cases there is a one-to
   one relationship between an object in this document and an object in
   the Clause 30 MIB of [802.3ah].  In other cases, the objects of this
   document reflect a more complex entity and are reflected by more than
   one objectx in the Clause 30 MIB of [802.3ah].   
   
4.1 Relation to other SNMP MIBs
   
   This objects defined in this document do not overlap with MIB-2
   [RFC1213], the interfaces MIB [RFC2863], or the Ethernet-like
   interfaces MIB [RFC3635].  The objects defined here are defined for
   Ethernet-like interfaces only and use the same ifIndex as the
   associated Ethernet interface.  
   
   This document is independent of the other MIBs derived from [802.3ah]
   for copper [802.3ah-copper] and EPON [802.3ah-epon].  
   
4.2 IANA Considerations
   
   The EFM OAM MIB requires the allocation of a single object identifier
   for its MODULE-IDENTITY under the MIB-2 tree.  IANA has not yet
   allocated this object identifier.
   
4.3 Mapping of IEEE 802.3ah Managed Objects
   
   This section contains the mapping between managed objects defined in
   [802.3ah] Clause 30, and managed objects defined in this document.

   this MIB in some way.  
   
   
5. MIB Structure
   
   The common EFM MIB objects of this memo focus on the OAM capabilities
   introduced in IEEE 802.3ah.  The MIB objects are partitioned into
   four (4) different MIB groups.
   
   The dot3OamTable group manages the primary OAM objects of the
   Ethernet interface.  This group controls the state and status of OAM
   as well as the mode in which it operates.  
   The dot3OamStats table maintains statistics on the number and type of
   Ethernet OAM frames being transmitted and received on the Ethernet
   interface.
   
   The dot3OamPeer table maintains the current information on the status
   and configuration of the peer OAM entity on the Ethernet interface. 
   Managed information includes the capabilities and function available
   on the peer OAM entity.  
   
   The dot3OamEvent table defines the management objects for the event
   notification capability available in IEEE P802.3ah OAM.  With IEEE
   P802.3ah OAM, one device may send notifications to its peer devices
   whenever an important event happens on the local device.

          changes are primarily reflected in the new OAM features
          developed under this project, that can be applied to any
          Ethernet like interface. The OAM features are described in
          Clause 57 of [802.3ah].

        DESCRIPTION 
          "At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on
          the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
          determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
          progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM
          sublayer.  
                     
          This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
          interface via the dot3OamAdminState.  
   
          If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
          with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). 
                           
          The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
          passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
          OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM
          capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) is used by active mode
          devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
          trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
          not yet made that determination.  
                           
          The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM
          entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
          rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
          for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
          unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
          rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes

          oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
          by the local device, the state moves to
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
          fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
          diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
          whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
          or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
          decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
          in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
          30.3.6.1.10).  
   
          If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
          becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
          states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
          difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected
          the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
          via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the
          aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).  
                           
          When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
          OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
          operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].  "

          remoteLoopback(3).  If the local OAM client is in the process
          of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3,

        DESCRIPTION 
          "Ethernet OAM includes the ability to generate and receive
          event notifications to indicate various link problems.  This
          table contains the mechanisms to configure the thresholds to
          generate the standard Ethernet OAM events.  
   
          These events are:
            - Errored Symbol Period Event.  Generated when the number of
              symbol errors exceeds a threshold within a given window 
              defined by a number of symbols (e.g. 1,000 symbols out of 
              1,000,000 had errors).  
            - Errored Frame Period Event.  Generated when the number of 
              frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window 
              defined by a number of frames (e.g. 10 frames out of 1000 
              had errors).  
            - Errored Frame Event.  Generated when the number of frame 
              errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined 
              by a period of time (e.g. 10 frames in 1 second had 
              errors).
            - Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event.  Generated when the 
              number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within
              a given time period (e.g. 10 errored frame seconds within 
              the last 100 seconds).  An errored frame second is defined
              as a 1 second interval which had >0 frame errors.

7. Security Considerations
   
   The readable objects in this module can provide information about
   network traffic, and therefore may be considered sensitive.  In
   particular, OAM provides mechanisms for reading the IEEE 802.3 Clause
   30 MIB attributes from a link partner via a specialized layer two
   protocol.  Unlike SNMP, IEEE P802.3ah OAM does not include encryption
   or authorization mechanisms.  It should be used in environments where
   either this interface information is not considered sensitive, or
   where the facility terminations are protected.  By default, OAM is
   disabled on Ethernet-like interfaces and is therefore not a risk.  
   
   IEEE 802.3ah OAM is designed to support deployment in access and
   enterprise networks.  In access networks, one end of a link is the
   CO-side, and the other is the CPE-side, and the facilities are often
   protected in wiring cages or closets.  In such deployments, it is
   often the case that the CO-side is protected from access from the CPE
   side.  Within IEEE P802.3ah OAM, this protection from remote access
   is accomplished by configuring the CPE-side in passive mode using the
   dot3OamMode attribute.  This prevents the CPE from accessing
   functions and information at the CO-side of the connection.  In
   enterprise networks, read-only interface information is often
   considered non-sensitive.  
   



M. Squire              Expires - December 2004              [Page 54] 
                             EFM OAM MIB                    June 2004


   The operation of OAM on an Ethernet interface does not adversely
   affect data traffic as OAM is a slow protocol with very limited
   bandwidth potential, and it is not required for normal link
   operation.  And although there are a number of objects in this module
   with read-write or read-create MAX-ACCESS, they only affect the
   operation of the OAM protocol itself and not user data traffic.  
   
   The loopback capability of OAM can have potentially disruptive
   effects in that the when enabling remote loopback, the remote station
   automatically transmits all received traffic back to the local
   station except for OAM traffic.  This completely disrupts all higher
   layer protocols such as bridging, IP, and SNMP.  Therefore an
   attribute (dot3OamLoopbackIgnoreRx) was introduced to control whether
   the local station processes or ignores received loopback commands.  
   
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even   
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even   
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed   
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this   
   MIB module.
   
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).
   
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them
