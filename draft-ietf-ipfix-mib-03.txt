1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module for monitoring IP Flow Information
   Export (IPFIX) Devices including Exporters and Collectors.  The full
   configuration of the IPFIX Metering Process is out of the scope this
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   The IPFIX protocol provides network administrators with access to IP
   Flow information.  The architecture for the export of measured IP
   Flow information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting
   Process is defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture], per the
   requirements defined in [RFC3917].  The protocol document [RFC5101]
   specifies how IPFIX Data Record and Templates are carried via a
   congestion-aware transport protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to
   IPFIX Collecting Process.  IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX
   Information Elements, their name, type and additional semantic
   information, as specified in [RFC5102].  Finally [I-D.ietf-ipfix-as]
   describes what type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and
   how they can use the information provided.  It furthermore shows how
   the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and frameworks.

   It is assumed that Flow metering, export and collection is performed
   according to the IPFIX architecture defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture].  The monitored configuration
   parameters of the export and collection of Flow Templates and Records
   is modeled according to [RFC5101].  Packet selection and filtering
   methods that may be optionally used by the IPFIX Metering Process are
   not considered in this MIB module.  They are defined in the Packet
   Sampling (PSAMP) framework [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework] and sampling
   techniques [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech] documents.  Nevertheless the
   entry point for those methods [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib] is given within
   this MIB module since PSAMP export protocol [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol]
   is based on the IPFIX protocol.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The definitions of the basic terms like IP Traffic Flow, Exporting
   Process, Collecting Process, Observation Points, etc. can be found in
   the IPFIX protocol document [RFC5101].

5.  Structure of the IPFIX MIB

   The IPFIX MIB consists of four main tables, the Transport Session
   table, the Observation Domain table, the Template table and the
   Template Definition table.  Since the IPFIX architecture
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] foresees the possibility of using
   filtering and/or sampling functions to reduce the data volume the MIB
   provides the basic objects for these functions with the Selector
   Table and a subtree for hooking standard filtering and sampling
   functions.

   All remaining objects contain statistical values for the different
   tables contained in the MIB.  Finally an entry point for extensions
   of the IPFIX MIB is given that can be used e.g. for the PSAMP MIB
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib].

   The following subsections describe all tables in the IPFIX MIB
   module.

5.1.  The Transport Session Table

   The Transport Session is the basis of the MIB.  The Transport Session
   table (ipfixTransportSessionTable) contains all Transport Sessions
   between Exporter and Collector.  The table specifies the layer 4
   protocol of the Transport Session and, depending on the protocol,
   further parameters for the Transport Session.  In case of UDP and TCP
   these are the source and destination address as well as the source
   and destination port.  For SCTP the table contains the SCTP Assoc Id
   which is the index for the SCTP association in the SCTP MIB
   [RFC3873].  Finally a status of the Transport Session is given in the
   table.

5.1.1.  The Transport Session Group Table

   On Exporters, the Transport Session Group table
   (ipfixTransportSessionGroupTable) can be used to support features
   like failover, load-balancing, duplicate export to several Collectors
   etc.  The member type for each group member describes its
   functionality.

   For failover a Transport Session group can contain one Transport
   Session with member type "primary" and several Transport Sessions
   with type "secondary".  Entries with other member types are not
   allowed for that group.

   For load-balancing or parallel export all Transport Sessions in the
   group MUST have the same member type either "loadBalancing" or
   "duplicate".  The algorithms used for failover or load-balancing are



Dietz, et al.          draft-ietf-ipfix-mib-03.txt              [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                  February 2008


   out of the scope of this document.

   The notion of Transport Session Grouping is only available on
   Exporters.  Nevertheless the Transport Session Group table exists on
   Exporters and Collectors, for consistency reasons.  Each Transport
   Session Group on a Collector consists of a single Transport Session
   entry.  The member type for this entry MUST be set to unused.  If the
   Transport Session Grouping is not supported on an Exporter the same
   conditions as described above for Collectors apply.

   To illustrate the use of the above tables let us assume the following
   scenario: We have an Exporter on IP address 192.0.2.22 and a
   Collector on IP address 192.0.2.37.  The Exporter uses TCP to export
   Templates and Data Records.  This would lead to the following
   Transport Session Table on the Exporter:

     ipfixTransportSessionTable (2)
     |
     +- ipfixTransportSessionEntry (1)
        |
        +- index (5)
           +- ipfixTrasportSessionIndex (1) = 5
           +- ipfixTransportSessionProtocol (2) = 6 (TCP)
           +- ipfixTransportSessionAddressType (3) = 1 (ipv4)
           +- ipfixTransportSessionSourceAddress (4) = 192.0.2.22
           +- ipfixTransportSessionDestinationAddress (5) = 192.0.2.37
           +- ipfixTransportSessionSourcePort (6) = 7653
           +- ipfixTransportSessionDestinationPort (7) = 4739
           +- ipfixTransportSessionSctpAssocId (8) = 0
           +- ipfixTransportSessionTemplateRefreshTimeout (9) = 0
           +- ipfixTransportSessionOptionTemplateRefreshTimeout (10) = 0
           +- ipfixTransportSessionTemplateRefreshPacket (11) = 0
           +- ipfixTransportSessionOptionTemplateRefreshPacket (12) = 0
           +- ipfixTransportSessionStatus (13) = 2 (active)

   The values in brackets are the OID numbers.  The Collector would then
   have the same entry except that the index would be different (e.g.
   17).

   We further asume that the Exporter uses the above connection as the
   primary export for a session protected by a secondary backup
   connection with an ipfixTransportSessionIndex of 28.  Both, Exporter
   and Collector, also need to have a Transport Session Group Table.
   For the export this may look like the following table:







Dietz, et al.          draft-ietf-ipfix-mib-03.txt              [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                  February 2008


    ipfixTransportSessionGroupTable (3)
    |
    +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupEntry (1)
       |
       +- index (11)
          |
          +- index (5)
          |  +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupIndex (1) = 11
          |  +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupMemberType (2) = 1 (primary)
          +- index (28)
             +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupIndex (1) = 11
             +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupMemberType (2) = 2 (secondary)

   Since the Collector does not know which Transport Sessions belong
   together it has one Transport Session Group Table entry per Transport
   Session.  So the entry for the given example is the following:

      ipfixTransportSessionGroupTable (3)
      |
      +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupEntry (1)
         |
         +- index (19)
            |
            +- index (17)
               +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupIndex (1) = 19
               +- ipfixTransportSessionGroupMemberType (2) = 5 (unused)

5.2.  The Observation Domain Table

   The Observation Domain Table (ipfixObservationDomainTable) contains a
   reference to the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  The objects in the ENTITY MIB
   denote the Observation Point associated with the given Observation
   Domain Id.  In addition a direction can be given to render more
   specific which flow to monitor.  Since a Collector could receive the
   same Observation Domain Id in different sessions (thus from different
   Exporters) the table takes the Transport Session index as first
   index.  The Transport Session index would be typically zero (0) at an
   Exporter because the Observation Domain Id is usually unique per
   Device and thus need not to be scoped by the Transport Session.

5.3.  The Template Table

   The Template table lists all Templates (including Option Templates)
   that are sent (by an Exporter) or received (by a Collector).  The
   Templates are unique per Transport Session Group and Observation
   Domain, thus the table is indexed by the Transport Session Index and
   the Observation Domain Id from the previous two tables.  It contains
   the Set Id and an Access Time denoting the time when the Template was



Dietz, et al.          draft-ietf-ipfix-mib-03.txt              [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                  February 2008


   last sent or received.  In addition it contains an inactive timeout
   to terminate Flows that are inactive for a certain amount of time and
   an active timeout to expire Flows that are still active to get
   intermediate Flow Records for these long-living Flows.

5.4.  The Template Definition Table

   This table lists all the Information Elements contained in a Template
   or Option Template.  Therefore it takes the same indexes as the
   Template table plus the Template Id.  Its own index denotes the order
   of the Information Element inside the Template if necessary.  Besides
   the Information Element Id and the length of the encoded value the
   table contains flags for each Information Element.  The flags
   indicate if the Information Element is used for scoping or as a Flow
   key.

   To resume the above example the Exporter may want to export the
   octets received and dropped at the Observation Point since the last
   export of these values.  In addition it exports the start and end
   time of the flow relative to the timestamp contained in the IPFIX
   header.  The active timeout is set to 0 i.e., long-living Flows do
   not generate intermediate exports.  The inactive timeout is set to
   300 seconds i.e., a Flow is exported after 5 minutes of inactivity.
   This leads to the following Template Table defining Template and
   Option Template:

    ipfixTemplateTable (5)
    |
    +- ipfixTemplateEntry (1)
       |
       +- index (11)
          |
          +- index (3)
             |
             + index (257)
             | +- ipfixTemplateId (1) = 257
             | +- ipfixTemplateSetId (2) = 2
             | +- ipfixTemplateAccessTime (3) = 2007-7-9,12:49:11.2,+2:0
             | +- ipfixTemplateActiveTimeout (4) = 0
             | +- ipfixTemplateInactiveTimeout (5) = 500
             |
             + index (264)
               +- ipfixTemplateId (1) = 264
               +- ipfixTemplateSetId (2) = 3
               +- ipfixTemplateAccessTime (3) = 2007-7-9,12:47:04.8,+2:0
               +- ipfixTemplateActiveTimeout (4) = 0
               +- ipfixTemplateInactiveTimeout (5) = 0

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                  February 2008


   The Template Definition Table for the Template may look like follows:

   ipfixTemplateDefinitionTable (6)
   |
   +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionEntry (1)
      |
      +- index (11)
         |
         +- index (3)
            |
            + index (257)
              |
              +- index (1)
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIndex (1) = 1
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeId (2) = 158
              |  |                          (flowStartDeltaMicroseconds)
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeLength (3) = 4
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionFlags (4) = 0
              |
              +- index (2)
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIndex (1) = 2
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeId (2) = 159
              |  |                          (flowStartDeltaMicroseconds)
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeLength (3) = 4
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionFlags (4) = 0
              |
              +- index (3)
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIndex (1) = 3
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeId (2) = 1
              |  |                                     (octetDeltaCount)
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeLength (3) = 8
              |  +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionFlags (4) = 0
              |
              +- index (4)
                 +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIndex (1) = 4
                 +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeId (2) = 132
                 |                              (droppedOctetDeltaCount)
                 +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionIeLength (3) = 8
                 +- ipfixTemplateDefinitionFlags (4) = 0

5.5.  The Selector Table

   This table supports the usage of filtering and sampling functions as
   described in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture].  The implementation and
   use of this table is optional.  If implemented it contains lists of
   functions per Template, thus it takes the same indexes as the
   Template Definition table.  The Selector Index indicates the order of
   the functions i.e, the order in that the functions are applied to the



Dietz, et al.          draft-ietf-ipfix-mib-03.txt             [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                  February 2008


   packets observed at the Observation Point.  The functions are
   referred by object identifiers pointing to the function with its
   parameters.  If the table is implemented and no filtering or sampling
   is used for a Template then an entry for the Template should be
   created pointing to the Select All function (ipfixFuncSelectAll).

5.6.  The Selector Functions

   The subtree ipfixSelectorFunctions is a placeholder where all
   standard filtering and sampling functions should be located (if any)
   and is mainly built for extensibility in future versions.  It
   currently contains the Select All functions (ipfixFuncSelectAll).

   A future extension could produce e.g., the MIB tree shown in the
   following figure:

      ipfixSelectorFunctions
      |
      +- ipfixFuncSelectAll
      |  |
      |  +- ipfixFuncSelectAllAvail (is the function available?)
      |
      +- ipfixFuncF2
      |  |
      |  +- ipfixFuncF2Avail (is the function F2 available)
      |  |
      |  +- ipfixFuncF2Parameters (a table with parameters)
      ...
      |
      +- ipfixFunFn...

   If a Selector Function takes parameters the MIB should contain a
   table with an entry for each set of parameters used at the Exporter.
   In this way a future extension could point to an entry in that table
   to indicate both the used Selector Function as well as the parameters
   used for that function.

5.6.1.  Textual Convention IpfixFunctionAvailabilty

   In conjunction with the Selector Functions the textual convention
   IpfixFunctionAvailabilty is defined in the MIB.  It MUST be used
   within all Selector Functions to indicate if a standard function is

6.  MIB Definitions

   This section contains the definitions of the IPFIX-MIB module.  There
   are different mandatory groups defined for Collector and Exporter
   implementations.  The statistical objects are made optional.  As well
   as such features as Transport Session grouping which need not be
   supported by all IPFIX Devices.

          "The type of a member Transport Session in its Transport
          Session group (identified by the value of
          ipfixTransportSessionGroupIndex). The following values are
          valid:

          unknown(0)
              This value MUST be used if the status of the group
              membership cannot be detected by the equipment. This
              value should be avoided as far as possible.

          primary(1)
              This value is used for a group member that is used as
              the primary target of an Exporter. Other group members
              (with the same ipfixTransportSessionGroupIndex) MUST
              NOT have the value primary(1) but MUST have the value
              secondary(2).

          secondary(2)
              This value is used for a group member that is used as a
              secondary target of an Exporter. The Exporter will use
              one of the targets specified as secondary(2) within the
              same Transport Session group when the primary target is
              not reachable.

          duplicate(3)
              This value is used for a group member that is used for
              duplicate exporting i.e., all group members identified
              by the ipfixTransportSessionGroupIndex are exporting
              the same Records in parallel. This implies that all
              group members MUST have the the same membertype
              duplicate(3).

          loadBalancing(4)
              This value is used for a group member that is used as
              as one target for load-balancing. This means that a
              Record is sent to one of the group members in this
              group identified by ipfixTransportSessionGroupIndex.
              This implies that all group members MUST have the same
              membertype load-balancing(4)

          unused(5)
              This value MUST be specified if the Exporter does not
              support Transport Session grouping. It is the default
              value for Collectors since the Collector cannot decide
              if the received Transport Session uses Transport

          selecting every packet) this is a placeholder for future
          use and a guideline for implementing enterprise specific
          Selector Function objects.

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information should be employed in such environments.
