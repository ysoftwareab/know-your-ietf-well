Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency     November 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a number of requirements addressing issues
   that exist in the 3GPP IMS emergency services solution, and a
   proposed solution for marking SIP requests related to emergency
   services.  SIP-based emergency calls can be distinguished by the
   presence of the Service URN as defined in I-D-ietf-ecrit-phonebcp
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] and RFC 5031 [RFC5031].  The emergency
   services solution in the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), as
   described in 3GPP TS 23.167 [3GPP.23.167]specifies that the User
   Equipment (UE) performs emergency registration prior to or during the
   initiation of an emergency call which can be useful in specific
   scenarios such as roaming.  Marking of the emergency registration is
   a requirement described in this document that can not be fulfilled by
   the use of Service URN.  A further requirement for proposing a new
   method for marking requests related to emergency calls is to identify
   the call back from a PSAP.  Identification of the call back can aid
   in suppressing network-based and UA-based services.  A further
   requirement for proposing a new method for marking responses is the
   case where a UE did not recognize the request as an emergency service
   request.  Identification of the session as a emergency service
   session can aid in suppressing UA-based services or preventing
   transmission of a BYE request as required in some jurisdictions.  The
   requirements for marking emergency call related messages are explored
   in this document and a new URI parameter is proposed to fulfill these
   requirements.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119]


3.  Requirements

3.1.  General

   This section defines the requirements for introducing a new URI
   parameter to be used for marking emergency call related SIP requests.

3.2.  Requirements for additional emergency indication

   [REQ 1] Indication in REGISTER request:

   3GPP requires that a UE performs emergency registration under

   specific circumstances, such as roaming, as described in 3GPP TS
   23.167 [3GPP.23.167].  Marking the REGISTER request to indicate an
   emergency registration is necessary to inform the registrar that the
   contact address and AOR being registered is to be used for emergency
   calls, and roaming and barring restrictions should not be applied for
   the registered AOR.  A call back from a PSAP would be routed to the
   registered contact address.  Further requirements for the emergency
   registration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 [3GPP.23.167].

   [REQ 2] Indication of IMS Emergency call origination:

   The Service URN in the Request URI is considered to be the primary
   method for marking the INVITE request for emergency call initiation.
   However, it is considered necessary to add another marking to the
   emergency request, particularly if the Service URN in the Request-URI
   is replaced by a network entity (in the case of 3GPP, such actions
   are performed at the Emergency Call Session Control Function
   (E-CSCF)).  This can result in inappropriate handling at SIP entities
   prior to interworking the SIP request to ISUP at a PSTN gateway UA at
   the edge of the SIP network for routing towards the PSAP in the PSTN.

   [REQ 3] Indicating to the UA that an emergency call has been
   initiated:

   In the case that the UA is not emergency aware or no service URN for
   the requested emergency type is known, it will not populate the
   emergency INVITE with the service URN.  Upon the network identifying
   the Request URI as an emergency number, the Request URI can be
   replaced with the Service URN.  The UA is still unaware that an
   emergency call was initiated.  A backwards indication to the UA from
   the network can ensure proper handling of the emergency call at the
   UA, i.e. no services such as call hold are applied to the emergency
   call.

   [REQ 4] Marking the PSAP call back:

   Identifying a call back from a PSAP can allow the network to apply
   special handling of the call back.  Network-based services can be
   suppressed and the call can be routed to the contact address from
   which the emergency call was initiated.  Additionally, special
   handling of the call back can occur at the UA.

   PhoneBCP [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]suggests one possible method by
   which a call back can be identified, based upon the domain of the
   PSAP which answers the outgoing emergency call.  This is possible if
   the PSAP is located in an IP network and is capable of communicating
   using SIP signaling.  However, if the PSAP is located in the PSTN,
   attempting to identify the call back based upon the PSAP domain name

   is not possible.


4.  Proposed solution

4.1.  General

   This section provides an overview of the proposed new URI parameter
   to be used for marking requests related to emergency services.

4.2.  Proposed URI parameter

   A new URI parameter "sos" is defined in this document.  The "sos"
   parameter is appended to an AOR consistent with RFC 3261 [RFC3261].
   It is proposed that use of this URI parameter is restricted to the
   Contact header for request and responses related to an emergency call
   only.  The "sos" URI parameter MUST not be considered as a
   replacement for the Service URN for emergency calls originated by a
   UA.

4.3.  Proposed use of "sos" parameter

4.3.1.  REGISTER request

   It is proposed that when the UA sends a REGISTER request for
   emergency registration, the "sos" URI parameter SHALL be appended to
   the AOR in the Contact header.  This serves as an indication to the
   registrar that the request is for emergency registration.

   The "sos" URI parameter SHALL be present in the Contact header in the
   200 (OK) response sent upon successful registration, thus indicating
   to the UA that this contact address will be included in the Contact
   header of an INVITE for emergency call initiation.

4.3.2.  Requests for emergency call initiation

   When an emergency aware UA initiates an emergency call, the UA SHOULD
   include the "sos" URI parameter, appended to the contact address, in
   the Contact header in the INVITE request.

   An entity in the network that handles emergency calls (in the case of
   3GPP the P-CSCF is aware of the local emergency numbers and can
   detect that a request is for an emergency call), SHOULD append the
   "sos" URI parameter to the contact address in the Contact header in
   the event that the "sos" URI parameter is not present in the Contact
   header.

   This serves as an indication that this is an emergency call even in



Patel                      Expires May 7, 2009                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency     November 2008


   the case when the Service URN is removed by a network entity.

4.3.3.  Call back from PSAP

   The call back from the PSAP SHOULD include the "sos" URI parameter in
   the Contact header of the INVITE request.  If the PSAP is SIP
   capable, then the "sos" URI parameter SHOULD be included by the PSAP.
   If the PSAP is located in the PSTN, the PSTN gateway UA at the edge
   of the SIP network SHOULD append the "sos" parameter to the contact
   address in the Contact header of the generated INVITE request that is
   routed back to the emergency caller.  This serves as an indication to
   network entities and to the UE to apply special call handling such as
   to suppress services that would normally be applied to a terminating
   call.

4.3.4.  SIP responses

   The "sos" URI parameter MAY be included in provisional responses and
   2xx responses to initial INVITE request for emergency call.  This can
   serve as an indication to a UA that is not "emergency aware" that an
   emergency call has been initiated, thus allowing the UA to provide
   special handling of such a call.  Suppressing call hold or multi-
   party call initiation during the emergency call to the PSAP are
   examples of special handling.  It is RECOMMENDED that in such a
   response, the "sos" URI parameter is included in the Contact header,
   appended to contact address.


5.  Formal syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 [RFC2234]

   uri-parameter = *(";"value)

   value = sos


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new SIP URI parameter, as per the
   registry created by RFC 3969 [RFC3969]

   Parameter Name: sos

   Predefined Values: none

   Reference: [RFCXXXX]

Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency     November 2008


   [NOTE TO IANA: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number of this
   specification.]


7.  Security Considerations

   The "sos" URI parameter does not appear to raise any particular
   security issue.  Misuse of the "sos" URI parameter, by including it
   in a request or response not related to an emergency call SHOULD be
   monitored by a network entity.
