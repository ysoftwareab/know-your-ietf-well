Internet-Draft           Session State Analysis            February 2009


Abstract

   Session state on unsuccessful re-INVITE is an open issue[1].  Many
   people interested in this topics and there has been a lot of
   discussion in the mail list publicly or among participants privately.
   This text tried to analyse incorrectness or drawback of some of the
   methods to reveal the imortance of precise definition of session
   state.

Internet-Draft           Session State Analysis            February 2009


1.  Introduction

   There are more than one method to solve the problem mentioned above.
   I collected four types of such way from discussion and other open
   way, such as drafts.

   o rollback to session state before Re-INVITE; o commit any session
   parameters that have been sucessfully changed; o "manual rollback"
   using a new Re-INVITE; o giving out a precise definition of session
   state;

   I will analyse incorrectness and drawback of the first three ways to
   reveal the importance of precise definition of session state.  This
   text is not intend to introduce any solution in the fourth way, and
   one of such way can be found in [2].

2.  Rollback to session state before Re-INVITE

   If the Offer/Answer pairs belonging to or during(such as UPDATE) the
   Re-INVITE is just parts of the original modification triggered by Re-
   INVITE, such as precondition notification, should rollback with the
   failure of Re-INVITE.

   There will be one and only one Offer/Answer pair belonging to Re-
   INVITE, others is just during the Re-INVITE.  The succedent Offer/
   Answer pairs during the Re-INVITE, can be parts of the original
   modification or a new modification of the same session.  If it is a
   new modification, and having been processed successfully, it must not
   rollback with the failure of Re-INVITE.  The reason is that we have
   no reason to say that the the new successful modification should be
   commited by the signal(2XX of Re-INVITE) associate to the original
   modification request.  And in signal level, Re-INVITE and UPDATE is
   independent transaction(SIP).  The new modification commitment and
   its state have nothing to do whit the success/failure of Re-INVITE.

   So, we can find that ignoring the relationship among Offer/Answer
   pairs, and just "rollback to session state before Re-INVITE" is
   arbitrary.  This method is not acceptable.

3.  Commit any session parameters that have been sucessfully changed

3.1.  Intuitionistic drawback

   As mentioned in RFC3311: Although UPDATE can be used on confirmed
   dialogs, it is RECOMMENDED that a re-INVITE be used instead.  This is
   because an UPDATE needs to be answered immediately, ruling out the
   possibility of user approval.  Such approval will frequently be
   needed, and is possible with a re-INVITE.

   It reveal the main difference of Re-INVITE and UPDATE.  If we can not
   clarify the session state on unsuccessful re-INVITE, we just give up
   the advantages of Re-INVITE.

   "Commit any session parameters that have been sucessfully changed"
   just make Re-INVITE as UPDATE.  And we may ask: Why we need Re-INVITE
   further while modification of session using Re-INVITE is just as the
   one using UPDATE?

3.2.  Confirmed state but not enough for usage

   Considering situation: One side using Re-INVITE to reduce the number
   of media types, such as audio and vedio session to audio session, or
   to use codec needing less resources.  There are Offer/Answer pairs
   before the final response of Re-INVITE.  At last, the other side
   reject the modification.

   If we obey the rule "session parameters that have been sucessfully
   changed during the duration of the re-INVITE transaction MUST remain
   unchanged", the media types or resources are not enough for the user.

   EEven if user sends a new Re-INVITE to reopen the media types, but
   there is not enough media types or resources during this new Re-
   INVITE and it violates the continuity of session usage.  For advanced
   media type, such as virtual reality pursuing immersion for users, it
   will be terrible.

3.3.  Iseless pending state

   Reasons, such as precondition, can make the session state in pending
   state.  And if the preconidtion is not met, the two sides may not use
   the resources.

   Perhaps, the only way to resuming the session is to send a new Re-
   INVITE.  So the violation of continuity of session usage is also
   exist here.  It is ironic that if the session state has been
   rollbacked to the one before the previous Re-INVITE, the session
   state will be clear, and it can assure the continuity of session

   usage by the rules in section 8 of RFC3264.

3.4.  Inconsistent state

   Considering precondition(in fact any modification overlaps more than
   one Offer/Answer may be same), the two sides just has a shared view
   of the status of a media stream, not the precondition.  So the
   precondition in each side can be different

   The suspending and resuming of modification is operated by each user
   agent itself[6].  Then the modification here might not be consistent.

   For example, if precondition of one side is met and the other side is
   not met, the two sides will have inconsistent states.  As 3.3, the
   only way to resuming the session is to send a new Re-INVITE.

   The situations mentioned above show that this method has problems.
   This method is not acceptable.

   There are cases in this section need help of "manual rollback" using
   a new Re-INVITE.  Incorrectness or drawback of "manual rollback"
   using a new Re-INVITE is in section 4.

4.  Manual rollback using a new Re-INVITE

4.1.  Problems for ordinary SDP

   Sections mentioned above introduced "manual rollback" using a new Re-
   INVITE as the way to resume the session under ambiguous situations.
   But if the two sides have no consistent view of session state, no
   matter which side sends the new Re-INVITE, the other side will treat
   it as violation of session continuity because of different view of
   session state.

   So, from the points of session continuity, a precise definition of
   session state, as the fourth way, is needed for all situations
   mentioned above.

4.2.  Problems for non-integrative SDP

4.2.1.  Theoretical analysis

   Because the SDP just describe part of the session, not all aspects of
   the session.  It must be combined with the previous one(or ones) to
   show the effects, as the formula:

   "current session state" = "previous session state" + "modification
   session description".

   Even if using a new Re-INVITE with "modification session
   description", we can not rebulid the "current session state" without
   the definition of the "previous session state".  So, the "previous
   session state" is important here, and we still need to give out a
   precise definition of session state to get the "previous session
   state" here.

4.2.2.  Unable to construct the new complete SDP

   Some persons may ask that can we construct the new complete SDP.
   First, complete SDP might not be constructed for syntax of non-
   integrative SDP, such as the usage in [7].

   RFC4566 pointed out that attribute interpretation depends on the
   media tool being invoked.  And if the interpretation refer to some
   kind of complex function expression.  The rollback of modification
   can only be processed in the media tool side.  The other
   side(controlling side) have no way to onstruct the new complete SDP,
   so it can not do such rollback by a new Re-INVITE.

   Situations unable to rollback using "manual rollback", can be treated
   as proof of the importance of precise definition of session state.

5.  Giving out a precise definition of session state

   A precise definition of session state is the way giving out the rules
   which can be practical in all situations.  This text is not intend to
   introduce any solution in this way, and one of such way can be found
   in [2].

6.  Conclusion

   Considering incorrectness or drawback of the first three ways, we can
   admit that a precise definition of session state is important for
   current SIP/SDP usage and for the evolvement in the future.
