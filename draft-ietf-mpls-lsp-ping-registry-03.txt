                IANA registries for LSP ping Code Points
                  draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-registry-03

Abstract

   RFC 4379 and RFC 6424 created name spaces for Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping.  However, those RFCs
   did not create the corresponding IANA registries for the Downstream
   Mapping object Flags (DS Flags), Multipath Type, Pad TLV and Address
   Types.

   There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
   name spaces.  This document updates RFC 4379 and RFC 6424 in that it
   creates the IANA registries for that purpose.

Internet-Draft        IANA registries for LSP ping            March 2015


   This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust's Legal
   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents
   (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of
   publication of this document.  Please review these documents

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] created name spaces for MPLS LSP Ping.
   However, those RFCs did not create the corresponding IANA registries
   for DS Flags, Multipath Type, Pad TLV and Address Types.

   There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
   name spaces.  In particular [I-D.ietf-mpls-entropy-lsp-ping] and
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-lag-multipath]  are requesting allocation for
   DS Flags and Multipath Type.

   This document serves to update [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] in that it
   creates the IANA registries for that purpose.

   Note that "DS Flags" and "Multipath Type" are fields included in two
   TLVs defined in "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry: Downstream Mapping TLV
   (value 2) and Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV (value 20).
   Modification to their registry will affect both TLVs.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to create new registries within
   [IANA-MPLS-LSP-PING] protocol to maintain "DS Flags", "Multipath
   Type", "Pad TLV" and "Address Types" fields.  Name of registries and
   initial values are described in immediate sub-sections to follow.

2.1.  DS Flags

   [RFC4379] defines the Downstream Mapping (DSMAP) TLV, which has the
   Type 2 assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

   [RFC6424] defines the Downstream Detailed Mapping (DDMAP) TLV, which
   has the Type 20 assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

   DSMAP has been deprecated by DDMAP, but both TLVs share a field: "DS
   Flags".

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled "DS
   Flags" with the following registration procedure:

                           Registry Name: DS Flags.

    Bit number Name                                        Reference

          6    I: Interface and Label Stack Object Request   RFC4379
        5-0    Unassigned

   Assignments of DS Flags are via Standards Action [RFC5226].

2.2.  Multipath Type

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled
   "Multipath Type".

   The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are:


      0-250    Standards Action
    251-254    Experimental Use
        255    Standards Action


   IANA is requested to make the following initial assignments:

                           Registry Name: Multipath Type.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document simply creates IANA registries for code point defined
   in [RFC4379] and [RFC6424].  Thus, there are no new security
   concerns.
