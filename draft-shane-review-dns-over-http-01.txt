            A review of implementation DNS over port 80/443
                  draft-shane-review-dns-over-http-01

Abstract

   The default DNS transport uses UDP on port 53.  There are many
   motivations why users or operators may prefer to avoid sending DNS
   traffic in this way.  A common solution is to use port 80 or 443;
   with plain TCP, TLS-encrypted TCP, or full HTTP(S).  This memo
   reviews the possible approaches and delivers some useful information
   for developers.

1.  Introduction

   Name servers use port 53, on both UDP and TCP [RFC1035] [RFC5966].
   However, users or operators occasionally find it useful to use an
   alternative way to deliver DNS information, and often pick port 80
   (the default HTTP port) or 443 (the default HTTPS port) for this
   purpose.

   There are several use cases:

   o  Case 1: Firewalls or other middleboxes may interfere with normal
      DNS traffic [RFC3234] [RFC5625] [DOTSE] [SAC035].  In addition,
      some ISPs and hotels block external DNS and perform DNS rewriting
      to send users to advertising pages, or may use IP addresses which
      cause misleading geographic location for the user
      [I-D.ietf-dnsop-edns-client-subnet].  Users may want DNSSEC
      support which is not deployed locally in such a case, and so on.

   o  Case 2: Users may use DNS over TLS or HTTPS to protect privacy.
      This also allows the client to authenticate the server.

   o  Case 3: Developers may want a higher level DNS API.  Web
      developers may prefer different abstractions or familiar tools
      like JSON or XML, transmitted using HTTP or HTTPS.

   This memo does not aim to develop standards or tools.  The purpose is
   to review various implementation options as a reference for
   developers.  However, it may be helpful for anyone hoping to develop
   specifications for DNS over 80/443 in the future.

   Note that most of the implementations described in this memo are on
   port 80/443 and combined with TCP/TLS/HTTP(S).  The main focus is

   between stub resolvers and recursive servers, and the discussion is
   about the stub resolver to recursive server communication.

2.  Different Implementations Approaches

2.1.  DNS over TCP on port 80/443

   The simplest approach is just moving the DNS traffic to port 80 or
   443 from 53.  This approach serves the requirement use case 1.

   In this way, the whole protocol is the same as current DNS transport
   in TCP, except the transport port is moved to port 80 or 443.  The
   difference between port 80 and 443 is that the traffic of port 80 is
   usually intercepted as HTTP traffic for purposes of deeper
   inspection, while the traffic of port 443 is usually considered to be
   encrypted, and typically ignored by middle-boxes.  One example where
   DNS is transported through port 80/443 is one of the fallback cases
   of NLnetLabs' DNSSEC trigger [dnssec-trigger].

   Transporting DNS through port 80/443 is an easy implementation.
   Developers can simply run an existing DNS server and configure the
   DNS software to listen on ports 80/443.  The client can also apply
   this change without any significant changes.

   One drawback of this approach is that it might mislead the client
   because of the port used.  For example, clients might think DNS over
   443 as a secure protocol because normally the session would be
   encrypted.  In this case, however, it is not.

2.2.  DNS over TLS on port 443

   Another approach is DNS over TLS on port 443, which is also
   implemented in DNSSEC trigger.  It is similar to
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls], which uses the well-known port 853.
   Using port 443 to carry the traffic still serves the purpose in use
   case 1, as some middle boxes may block traffic on the new port.

   << Note: or we can just recommend developer to follow draft-ietf-
   dprive-dns-over-tls but using port 443 >>

   As specified in RFC 5246 [RFC5246], both the DNS server and client
   can be authenticated or not authenticated.  The DNS service providers
   can decide authenticated pattern on both server and client sides
   based on their own requirement for security and privacy.

   TLS provide many benefits for DNS.  First, it significantly reduces
   DNS conversation's vulnerability of being hijacked.  Second, it
   prevents resolvers from becoming amplifiers of reflection attack.

   Additionally, it provides privacy by encrypted the conversation
   between client and server.

   One concern of DNS over TLS is its cost.  Compared to UDP, DNS-over-
   TCP requires an additional round-trip-time (RTT) of latency to
   establish a TCP connection.  Use of TLS encryption algorithms adds an
   additional RTT, and results in slightly higher CPU usage.  It should
   also be considered that the DNS packet over TLS on a new port might
   be dropped by some middle boxes.  Another concern of TLS is the
   deployment difficulty when authenticating the server.  If servers are
   authenticated, certificate management is required.

2.3.  DNS Wire-format over HTTP(S)

   Different from DNS over TCP using port 80/443, another option is
   encapsulating DNS wire-format data into an HTTP body and sending it
   as HTTP(S) traffic.  It is quiet useful in use cases 1 & 2 described
   in the introduction.  This approach has the benefit that HTTP usually
   makes it through even the worst coffee shop or hotel room firewalls,
   as this expected by Internet users.  It also benefits from HTTP's
   persistent TCP connection pool concept (see section 6.3 in
   [RFC7230]), which DNS on TCP port 53 does not have.  Finally, as with
   DNS over TLS, HTTPS provides data integrity and privacy.

   The basic methodology works as follows:

   1.  The client creates a DNS query message.

   2.  The client encapsulates the DNS message in a HTTP(S) message body
       and assigns parameters with the HTTP header.

   3.  The client connects to the server and issues an HTTP(S) POST
       request method.

   4.  The server decapsulates the HTTP package to DNS query, and
       resolves the DNS query.

   5.  The server encapsulates the DNS response in HTTP(S) and sends it
       back via the HTTP(S) session.

   Note that if the original DNS query is sent by TCP, first two bits of
   the package is the message length and should be removed.  (This is
   only true if some software is translating from the DNS protocol to
   DNS over HTTP, for example via a proxy.  Native implementations will
   of course not need this.)  There is an implementation of this
   methodology in the Go Programming Language (https://github.com/BII-
   Lab/DNSoverHTTPinGO) as well as C (https://github.com/BII-Lab/
   DNSoverHTTP), maintained by BII lab.

   In addition to the benefits mentioned before, the HTTP header makes
   DNS wire-format over HTTP(S) easy to extend.  Compared to creating a
   new option in EDNS0, using new parameters in HTTP header is far
   easier to deploy, since DNS messages with EDNS0 may not pass some
   middle boxes.

   One disadvantage of packaging DNS into HTTP is its cost.  Doing pack
   and unpack costs CPU and may result in higher response time.  The DNS
   over HTTP messages also have a risk of being dropped by some
   firewalls which intercepts HTTP packets.  And it should be noted that
   if HTTPS is used here, then all the discussion of TLS in previous
   section is also applicable here.

2.4.  REST HTTP API

   As mentioned in use case 3, one motivation of a REST HTTP API is for
   web developers who need to get DNS information but cannot create raw
   requests (for example JavaScript developers).  They can work by
   creating HTTP requests other than real DNS queries.

   In this style of implementation DNS data is exchanged in other
   formats than wire format, like JSON [I-D.bortzmeyer-dns-json], or XML
   [I-D.mohan-dns-query-xml].  There are also lots of REST DNS API
   developed by DNS service providers.

   Most of these APIs are developed in the scope of their own system
   with different specification.  But a typical query is a client will
   requesting a special formatted URI.  Usually there is a HTTP(S)
   server listening to port 80/443, which will parse the request and
   create a DNS query or DNS operation command towards the real DNS.
   Unlike wire-format DNS over HTTP(S), once the HTTP(S) server receives
   the response, it create the response by putting DNS data into various
   structured formats like JSON, XML, YAML, or even plain text.

   However, this approach may have issues, because it is not based on
   traditional DNS protocol.  So there is no guarantee of the protocol's
   completeness and correctness.  The support of DNSSEC might also be a
   problem because the response usually do not contain RR records with
   the answer, making it impossible for a client to validate the reply.
