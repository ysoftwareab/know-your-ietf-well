Abstract

   The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) provides a mechanism
   where by network clients, with little or no static configuration,
   can discover desired network services. SSDP uses HTTP over multicast
   and unicast UDP to provide two functions: OPTIONS and ANNOUNCE.
   OPTIONS is used to determine if a desired network service exists on
   the network. ANNOUNCE is used by network services to announce their
   existence.

1.   Introduction

   With the growing number of small peer-to-peer TCP/IP networks, such
   as home or small office networks, computer users need a way to
   discover resources in a network easily, quickly, dynamically, and
   without any a priori knowledge.  This document proposes a discovery
   protocol that meets this user requirement.

   The proposed protocol is called the Simple Service Discovery
   Protocol (or SSDP).  SSDP performs only discovery.  It leaves any
   additional service description and/or negotiation to a higher layer
   service-specific protocol.

   Using SSDP, operating systems and applications can discover SSDP-
   enabled services in a network dynamically by issuing service
   queries.  Services that match the queries respond with their network
   locations and protocols to be used to communicate with them.  In
   addition, services can make their presence known through unsolicited
   announcements.

2.   Terminology

   Service Provider
          A resource that provides one or more network services, such
          as printing.

   SSDP Server
          A resource that advertises services and responds to service
          queries on behalf of one or more Service Providers.

   SSDP Client
          A resource that locates services of interest by sending out
          service queries and gathering responses.

   In addition, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [2].

3.   Protocol Overview

   SSDP-enabled services are discoverable in two ways.  Firstly, a SSDP
   Client sends a service query using an OPTIONS message. The OPTIONS
   message is encapsulated in an UDP packet and sent to a reserved
   multicast IP address and port.  SSDP Servers MUST always listen for
   service queries.  They MUST respond to the SSDP Client's query using
   one or more Reply messages, if they represent Service Providers that
   match those specified in the query. In addition, SSDP Servers MUST
   wait for a randomly selected period between MIN_REPLY_DELAY_INTERVAL
   and MAX_REPLY_DELAY_INTERVAL (inclusively) before it sends any Reply
   message.

   The SSDP Client times out if it does not receive a Reply message for
   a service query within RETRY_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL.  The SSDP Client
   SHOULD retransmit another OPTIONS message at a randomly selected
   time between MIN_RETRY_INTERVAL and MAX_RETRY_INTERVAL (inclusively)
   after the timeout.  It SHOULD re-send the OPTIONS message up to
   MAX_RETRIES times.  Re-sent OPTIONS messages SHOULD use the same
   Request-ID as the original request.

4.   Multicast and UDP

   SSDP transmits its OPTIONS and ANNOUNCE messages using multicast
   UDP.  A multicast IP address and two port numbers will be reserved
   for the SSDP.  SSDP Servers MUST listen on the reserved address and
   the first port for OPTIONS messages.  They MUST send ANNOUNCE
   messages to the reserved address and the second port.

   [Ed. Note: It is the intention of the authors to produce a separate
   draft that specifies how to use HTTP over unicast and multicast UDP.
   The SSDP draft will then reference this other draft.]

5.   Header Definitions

   SSDP uses the HTTP message syntax, methods and headers. Small
   changes have been made in order to enable proper functionality over
   UDP multicast/unicast. HTTP headers and methods that appear in this
   document but are not defined explicitly MUST follow their
   definitions in the HTTP specification [3].

5.1. Host Header

   The Host header in HTTP specifies the Internet host and port number
   of the resource being requested.  In a multicast environment the
   value of the Host header should be the multicast address and port.

5.2. Alt-Locations Header

   The Alt-Locations header is used in conjunction with the Location
   header.  When present, it lists alternative location(s) to the one
   specified in the Location header for completion of the request.

   Alt-Locations = "Alt-Locations" ":" 1#('<' AbsoluteURI '>')

   AbsoluteURI is defined in the HTTP specification [3].

   The Alt-Locations header is an extension of the Location header
   although it MAY be used without the Location header. Resources
   SHOULD first try to resolve the URI in the Location header and only
   continue on to the Alt-Locations header if the URI in the Location
   header could not be successfully resolved or if there is no Location
   header. Entries in the Alt-Locations header should then be resolved,
   in order.

   [Ed. Note: Since there are at least two specs which want to use this
   header, it is likely this header will be split out into its own
   spec.]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 SSDP/V1              February 26, 1999


5.3. Request-ID Header

   The Request-ID header is used to correlate responses from different
   hosts for a particular request and to distinguish responses for
   different service requests.

   Request-ID = "Request-ID" ":" AbsoluteURI

   In order to prevent the possibility of collisions Request-Ids must
   be unique across all requests from all resources for all time. One
   URI able to meet this requirement is the UUID URI that is defined as
   follows:

   UUID_URI = 'UUID' ':' UUID [Extension]

   The UUID and Extension productions are defined in [4].

   [Ed. Note: It is the author's intention to put the UUID URI
   definition in its own draft and to then make SSDP dependent on that
   draft.]

   [Ed. Note: Technically a Request-ID only needs to be unique to the
   resource that sent it. However this requires that the Request-ID be
   associated with some other value in order to tell one Request-ID
   from another. The most obvious value would be the IP address that
   sent the multicast UDP request. However IP addresses are constantly
   re-assigned and so using them to differentiate Request-Ids could
   cause a collision.]

6.   Method Definitions

6.1. OPTIONS

6.1.1.    Request

   SSDP uses the OPTIONS method to determine if services are available
   on the network.

   The Request-URI is the URI of the service to be discovered. The
   HTTP/1.1 reserved Request-URI '*' is interpreted as meaning all
   services.

   [Ed. Note: Need to add a section explaining how URIs are used to
   identify services.]

   The OPTIONS message MUST include a Host header and a Request-ID
   header.  Optionally, it MAY contain a Content-Length header, a
   Content-Type header and an Entity Body [3]. The Entity Body is used
   to provide additional information to select a Service Provider. If
   the resource processing the request does not understand the request
   body then it MUST ignore the request-body.



Cai, Leach, Gu and Goland                                     [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 SSDP/V1              February 26, 1999


   Below is an example of an OPTIONS message.

   OPTIONS /ietf/ipp/printer HTTP/1.1
   Host: 239.255.255.254:999
   Request-ID: uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
   Alt-Locations: <httpu://foo.com/bar:1270><http://foo.com/bar:80>

   Please note that the multicast address and port are not the SSDP
   reserved multicast address and port and are only included as an
   example.

   In this example the sender requests that a response be sent using
   HTTP unicast UDP if at all possible. If not then the response should
   be sent using normal HTTP. Note, however, that this requires
   establishing a TCP/IP connection and then sending a response. This
   behavior is not provided for by [3]. However, by including an HTTP
   URL in the Location header of an HTTPU or HTTPMU request the sender
   is indicating their support for receiving the response directly over
   TCP/IP.

6.1.2.    Response

   If a Location and/or Alt-Locations header is included in the request
   then the response MUST be directed to the first URI the resource has
   the ability to respond to. If the resource can not respond to any of
   the listed URIs then a response MUST NOT be sent.

   If no Location and/or Alt-Locations header is included then the
   resource MUST respond to the sender using unicast UDP.

   In either case the response MUST contain the same Request-ID as the
   request.

   The URI scheme name httpu is reserved for use with HTTP unicast UDP.
   The URI scheme name httpmu is reserved for use with HTTP multicast
   UDP.

   [Ed. Note: Both schemes will be placed in the HTTP over UDP
   document.]

   All resources that are able to accept incoming multicast UDP HTTP
   requests MUST be able to respond using unicast UDP HTTP.

   A 200 response to a multicast UDP OPTIONS request indicates that the
   response includes all OPTIONS information. A 3xx series response may
   also be used to direct the client to another location where they
   SHOULD retry their request.

   The Reply message SHOULD include a Location and/or Alt-Locations
   headers. Optionally it MAY contain a Content-Length header, a
   Content-Type header and an Entity Body. If the resource does not

INTERNET-DRAFT                 SSDP/V1              February 26, 1999


   understand the response body then the default behavior is to ignore
   the response body.

   Below is an example of a Reply message.

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Request-ID: uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
   Location: ipp://printServer1/printerA
   Alt-Locations: <lpr://printServer1/printerA>

6.2. ANNOUNCE

6.2.1.    Request

   The ANNOUNCE method represents an unsolicited message from an SSDP
   Server to announce the availability of Service Providers.  The
   Request-URI is the URI of the service being announced.

   The Location header [3] specifies the protocol end-point of a
   Service Provider.  This header MUST contain the protocol that can be
   used to communicate with the Service Provider.

   Furthermore, if the Service Provider supports multiple protocols, an
   Alt-Location header is used to identify the additional protocol end-
   points.

   The ANNOUNCE message SHOULD include a Location header.  It SHOULD
   also include an Alt-Locations header if the Service Provider has
   more than one URI.  The ANNOUNCE method SHOULD NOT contain the
   Request-ID header.  Optionally, it MAY contain a Content-Length
   header, a Content-Type header and an Entity Body. If the resource
   processing the request does not understand the request body then it
   MUST ignore the request-body.

   Below is an example of an ANNOUNCE message.

   ANNOUNCE dmtf:printer HTTP/1.1
   Host: 239.255.255.254:999
   Location: ipp://printServer1/printerA
   Alt-Locations: <lpr://printServer1/printerA>

   Please note that the multicast address and port are not the SSDP
   reserved multicast address and port and are only included as an
   example.

   [Ed. Note: Using the service class as the request-URI of the
   announce method certainly seems nifty, but I'm not sure it is the
   right choice. From a practical point of view there appear to be two
   choices. Set the Request-URI for all ANNOUNCE methods to be "*" or
   use some sort of URI. "*" isn't terribly useful as it means that all
   ANNOUNCE methods get processed by one and only one resource. However
   using the service class as the request-URI means that we end up with


Cai, Leach, Gu and Goland                                     [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 SSDP/V1              February 26, 1999


   two very different types of resources sharing the same request-URI.
   One type is the type who takes in and responds to OPTIONS methods.
   The second type is the type who takes in and records ANNOUNCE
   methods. The trick is that the relationship between these two
   resources is circular. The resource which responds to OPTIONS
   methods is the one sending the ANNOUNCE methods. The one who records
   ANNOUNCE methods is the one who sends OPTIONS methods. But they both
   have the same request-URI. I'm not sure if this is really a problem
   but it is food for thought.]

6.2.2.    Response

     There is no response to an ANNOUNCE request.

7.   Practical Considerations

7.1. Multiple-Functional Devices

   A multiple-functional device provides several services in the same
   unit.  The SSDP Server for a multiple-functional device MUST send an
   ANNOUNCE message for each of the device functions (i.e., Service
   Providers).  For example, a device that combines a scanner and a fax
   machine would send out the following ANNOUNCE messages:

      Announce 1:
   ANNOUNCE /ietf/scanner HTTP/1.1
   HOST: 239.255.255.254:999
   Location: scannerProtocol://deviceY

      Announce 2:
   ANNOUNCE itu://devices/fax HTTP/1.1
   HOST: 239.255.255.254:999
   Location: faxProtocol://deviceY

7.2. SSDP Server Proxy

   For legacy devices that do not have their own SSDP Servers, a SSDP
   Server Proxy can be configured to announce services and respond to
   service queries on behalf of legacy devices.  With a SSDP Server
   Proxy, legacy devices can be made discoverable in the same way as
   devices with built-in SSDP Servers.

8.   Security Considerations

   SSDP does not provide a mechanism to sign or encrypt its requests.
   The authors feel that authentication/encryption for HTTP UDP is of
   sufficient general interest that it should be addressed in its own
   specification. SSDP will be made dependent upon this
   authentication/encryption specification.

   [Ed. Note: Section 6.19 of the SIP spec
   (http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-12.txt)

   provides an example of how one can encrypt individual HTTP
   messages.]

9.   Appendix A: Constants

   MAX_REPLY_DELAY_INTERVAL
          A parameter that indicates the maximum number of seconds that
          a SSDP Server MUST wait before it responds to a OPTIONS
          message.  This parameter SHOULD be configurable and the
          default value SHOULD be 8.

   MIN_REPLY_DELAY_INTERVAL
          A parameter that indicates the minimum number of seconds that
          a SSDP Server MUST wait before it responds to a OPTIONS
          message.  This parameter SHOULD be configurable and the
          default value SHOULD be 0.

   MAX_RETRIES
          A parameter that indicates the maximum number of times that a
          SSDP Client SHOULD repeat sending OPTIONS messages for a
          particular service query.  This parameter SHOULD be
          configurable and the default value SHOULD be 3.

   MAX_RETRY_INTERVAL
          A parameter that indicates the maximum number of seconds that
          a SSDP Client MUST wait (after each timeout) before it
          retransmits another OPTIONS message for a particular service
          query.  This parameter SHOULD be configurable and the default
          value SHOULD be 10.

   MIN_RETRY_INTERVAL
          A parameter that indicates the minimum number of seconds that
          a SSDP Client MUST wait (after each timeout) before it
          retransmits another OPTIONS message for a particular service
          query.  This parameter SHOULD be configurable and the default
          value SHOULD be 3.

   RETRY_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL
          A parameter that indicates the number of seconds that a SSDP
          Client MUST wait for a Reply message to a Discovery message
          before it times out.  This parameter SHOULD be configurable
          and the default value SHOULD be 15.
