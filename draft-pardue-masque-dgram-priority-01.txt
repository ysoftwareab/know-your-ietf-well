                 draft-pardue-masque-dgram-priority-01

Abstract

   Application protocols using the QUIC transport protocol rely on
   streams, and optionally the DATAGRAM extension, to carry application
   data.  Streams and datagrams can be multiplexed but QUIC provides no
   interoperable prioritization scheme or signaling mechanism itself.
   The HTTP Extensible Prioritization scheme describes how to prioritize
   streams in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.  This document adopts the scheme to
   support HTTP datagrams.

1.  Introduction

   Application protocols using the QUIC transport protocol [QUIC] rely
   on streams, and optionally the DATAGRAM extension [QUIC-DATAGRAM], to
   carry application data.  Streams and datagrams can be multiplexed but
   QUIC provides no interoperable prioritization scheme or signaling
   mechanism itself.  The HTTP Extensible Prioritization scheme
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority] describes how to prioritize streams in
   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.  This document adopts the scheme to support HTTP
   datagrams [HTTP-DATAGRAM].

   The Extensible Priorities scheme for HTTP describes how clients can
   send priority signals related to requests in order to suggest how a
   server allocates resources to serving responses.  When the protocol
   is HTTP/2, responses are carried on streams.  When the protocol is
   HTTP/3, responses are carries on QUIC streams.

   While QUIC streams support multiplexing natively via use of a stream
   identifier, the QUIC DATAGRAM extension does not provide any such
   identifier.  HTTP datagrams [HTTP-DATAGRAM] supports multiplexing

   using a set of application-level identifiers that can be controlled
   and accessed by HTTP/3.  One identifer relates to a request stream,
   the second, optional, identifer relates to an abstract context.
   [HTTP-DATAGRAM] does not, however, define any means for multiplexed
   datagram prioritization.

   When the application protocol is HTTP/3, HTTP Datagrams can map
   directly to QUIC datagrams or they can be carried on streams using a
   DATAGRAM Capsule; see Section 4.4 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].

   This document describes how the Extensible Priorities scheme applies
   to HTTP datagrams.  Priority signals sent by clients, related to
   requests, can also be considered input to server scheduling decisions
   for HTTP datagrams mapped to QUIC datagrams.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The term sf-integer is imported from [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

2.  Signalling Datagram Priority

   The Extensible Prioritization scheme [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority]
   provides a framework for communicating and acting upon priority
   parameters, using [STRUCTURED-FIELDS] formats.  It defines the
   urgency and incremental parameters and provides guidance to
   implementers about how to act on these parameters, in combination
   with other inputs, to make resource allocation and scheduling
   choices.  Urgency communicates the client-view of request importance,
   and incremental communicates how the client intends to process
   response data as it arrives.  Parameters are communicated in HTTP
   headers or version-specific frames.  A client omitting the urgency or
   incremental parameters can be interpreted by the server as a signal
   to apply default priorities.  The core scheme is extensible, new
   parameters can be defined to augment the base ones.

   This specification defines the datagram-urgency ("du") extension
   parameter that operates in addition to the base urgency.  There is no
   extension to the base incremental behavior; individual datragrams,
   even if belonging to the same identifier, are messages that are
   expected to be processed individually as they arrive.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Datagram Prioritization             July 2021


2.1.  Datagram Urgency

   The datagram-urgency parameter ("du") takes an integer between 0 and
   7, in descending order of priority.  This range matches the base
   urgency ("u") parameter range; see Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority].

   The value is encoded as an sf-integer.  There is no default value.

   This parameter indicates the sender's recommendation, based on the
   expectation that the server would transmit HTTP datagrams in the
   order of their datagram-urgency values if possible.  The smaller the
   value, the higher the precedence.  Omitting the datagram-urgency
   parameter is a signal to apply the value of the urgency parameter.

   The following example shows a request for a CSS file with the urgency
   set to "0", any associated datagrams have the lower urgency of "2":

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = example.net
   :path = /style.css
   priority = u=0, du=2

   Endpoints MUST NOT treat reception of the datagram-urgency parameter,
   even if HTTP datagram support is not enabled.

   The datagram-urgency parameter applies only to HTTP datagrams mapped
   to QUIC datagrams.  Datagram capsules are sent on streams, so the
   base urgency parameter applies to them.

2.2.  Prioritization of Contexts

   The datagram-urgency parameter applies to all HTTP datagram contexts
   related to a request stream.  Prioritization of individual contexts
   is not supported.

2.3.  Reprioritization

   Reprioritization is supported using the existing mechanisms defined
   in Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority].

3.  Client Scheduling

   Clients MAY use datagram-urgency to make local processing or
   scheduling choices about HTTP datagrams related to the requests it
   initiates.

4.  Server Scheduling

   Priority signals are input to a prioritization process.  Expressing
   priority is only a suggestion.  The datagram-urgency parameter
   introduces new scheduling considerations on top of those presented in
   Section 10 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority].

   It is RECOMMENDED that, when possible, servers send higher urgency
   HTTP datagrams before lower urgency datagrams.

   Where streams and datagrams have equal urgency and datagram-urgency,
   it is RECOMMENDED that servers alternate emitting HTTP datagrams and
   stream bytes.  Where servers implement the recommendations in
   Section 10 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority], alternating between
   datagram and stream data will result in fair scheduling.  This
   recommendation holds whether stream are incremental or not.

   It is RECOMMENDED that servers schedule DATAGRAM capsules the same as
   response data.

5.  Retransmission Scheduling

   Section 12 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority] provides guidance about
   scheduling of retransmission data vs. new data.  Since QUIC datagrams
   are not retransmitted, endpoints that prioritize QUIC stream
   retransmission data could delay datagrams.  Furthermore, since
   DATAGRAM capsules are sent as stream data, they *are* subject to
   retransmission and could also delay native QUIC datagrams.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are believed to be no additional considerations to those
   presented in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the following entry in the HTTP Priority
   Parameters Registry

   Name:  datagram-urgency

   Description:  Priority of HTTP datagrams
