1.  Introduction

   Networking protocols employ a variety of transient numeric
   identifiers for different protocol objects, such as IPv4 and IPv6
   Fragment Identifiers [RFC0791] [RFC8200], IPv6 Interface Identifiers
   (IIDs) [RFC4291], transport protocol ephemeral port numbers
   [RFC6056], TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) [RFC0793], and DNS
   Transaction IDs (TxIDs) [RFC1035].  These identifiers typically have
   specific interoperability requirements (e.g. uniqueness during a
   specified period of time), and associated failure modes when such
   requirements are not met [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation].

   For more than 30 years, a large number of implementations of the TCP/
   IP protocol suite have been subject to a variety of attacks, with
   effects ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) or data injection, to
   information leakages that could be exploited for pervasive monitoring
   [RFC7258].  The root cause of these issues has been, in many cases,
   poor selection of transient numeric identifiers, usually as a result
   of insufficient or misleading specifications.

   For example, implementations have been subject to security or privacy
   issues resulting from:

   o  Predictable IPv4 or IPv6 Fragment Identifiers (see e.g.
      [Sanfilippo1998a], [RFC6274], and [RFC7739])

   o  Predictable IPv6 IIDs (see e.g.  [RFC7721], [RFC7707], and
      [RFC7217])

Internet-Draft           Predictable Numeric IDs            January 2021


   o  Predictable transport protocol ephemeral port numbers (see e.g.
      [RFC6056] and [Silbersack2005])

   o  Predictable TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) (see e.g.
      [Morris1985], [Bellovin1989], and [RFC6528])

   o  Predictable DNS TxIDs (see e.g.  [Schuba1993] and [Klein2007])

   These examples indicate that when new protocols are standardized or
   implemented, the security and privacy properties of the associated
   transient numeric identifiers tend to be overlooked, and
   inappropriate algorithms to generate such identifiers (i.e. that
   negatively affect the security or privacy properties of the protocol)
   are either suggested in the specification or selected by
   implementers.

   This document contains a non-exhaustive timeline of the specification
   and vulnerability disclosures related to some sample transient
   numeric identifiers, including other work that has led to advances in
   this area.  This analysis indicates that:

   o  Vulnerabilities associated with the inappropriate generation of
      transient numeric identifiers have affected protocol
      implementations for an extremely long period of time.

   o  Such vulnerabilities, even when addressed for a given protocol
      version, were later reintroduced in new versions or new
      implementations of the same protocol.

   o  Standardization efforts that discuss and provide advice in this
      area can have a positive effect on protocol specifications and
      protocol implementations.

   While it is generally possible to identify an algorithm that can
   satisfy the interoperability requirements for a given transient
   numeric identifier, this document provides empirical evidence that
   doing so without negatively affecting the security or privacy
   properties of the aforementioned protocols is non-trivial.  Other
   related documents ([I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation] and
   [I-D.gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations]) provide guidance in this
   area, as motivated by the present document.

   This document represents the consensus of the Privacy Enhancement and
   Assessment Research Group (PEARG).

2.  Terminology

   Transient Numeric Identifier:
      A data object in a protocol specification that can be used to
      definitely distinguish a protocol object (a datagram, network
      interface, transport protocol endpoint, session, etc) from all
      other objects of the same type, in a given context.  Transient
      numeric identifiers are usually defined as a series of bits, and
      represented using integer values.  These identifiers are typically
      dynamically selected, as opposed to statically-assigned numeric
      identifiers (see e.g.  [IANA-PROT]).  We note that different
      identifiers may have additional requirements or properties
      depending on their specific use in a protocol.  We use the term
      "transient numeric identifier" (or simply "numeric identifier" or
      "identifier" as short forms) as a generic term to refer to any
      data object in a protocol specification that satisfies the
      identification property stated above.

   The terms "constant IID", "stable IID", and "temporary IID" are to be
   interpreted as defined in [RFC7721].

3.  Threat Model

   Throughout this document, we assume an attacker does not have
   physical or logical access to the system(s) being attacked, and
   cannot observe the packets being transferred between the sender and
   the receiver(s) of the target protocol (if any).  However, we assume
   the attacker can send any traffic to the target device(s), to e.g.
   sample transient numeric identifiers employed by such device(s).

4.  Issues with the Specification of Transient Numeric Identifiers

   While assessing protocol specifications regarding the use of
   transient numeric identifiers, we have found that most of the issues
   discussed in this document arise as a result of one of the following
   conditions:

   o  Protocol specifications that under-specify the requirements for
      their transient numeric identifiers

   o  Protocol specifications that over-specify their transient numeric
      identifiers

   o  Protocol implementations that simply fail to comply with the
      specified requirements

   A number of protocol specifications (too many of them) have simply
   overlooked the security and privacy implications of transient numeric



Gont & Arce               Expires July 17, 2021                 [Page 4]

   identifiers.  Examples of them are the specification of TCP ephemeral
   ports in [RFC0793], the specification of TCP sequence numbers in
   [RFC0793], or the specification of the DNS TxID in [RFC1035].

   On the other hand, there are a number of protocol specifications that
   over-specify some of their associated transient numeric identifiers.
   For example, [RFC4291] essentially overloads the semantics of IPv6
   Interface Identifiers (IIDs) by embedding link-layer addresses in the
   IPv6 IIDs, when the interoperability requirement of uniqueness could
   be achieved in other ways that do not result in negative security and
   privacy implications [RFC7721].  Similarly, [RFC2460] suggested the
   use of a global counter for the generation of Fragment Identification
   values, when the interoperability properties of uniqueness per {Src
   IP, Dst IP} could be achieved with other algorithms that do not
   result in negative security and privacy implications [RFC7739].

   Finally, there are protocol implementations that simply fail to
   comply with existing protocol specifications.  For example, some
   popular operating systems (notably Microsoft Windows) still fail to
   implement transport protocol ephemeral port randomization, as
   recommended in [RFC6056].

5.  IPv4/IPv6 Identification

   This section presents the timeline of the Identification field
   employed by IPv4 (in the base header) and IPv6 (in Fragment Headers).
   The reason for presenting both cases in the same section is to make
   it evident that while the Identification value serves the same
   purpose in both IPv4 and IPv6, the work and research done for the
   IPv4 case did not affect IPv6 specifications or implementations.

   The IPv4 Identification is specified in [RFC0791], which specifies
   the interoperability requirements for the Identification field: the
   sender must choose the Identification field to be unique for a given
   source address, destination address, and protocol, for the time the
   datagram (or any fragment of it) could be alive in the internet.  It
   suggests that a node may keep "a table of Identifiers, one entry for
   each destination it has communicated with in the last maximum packet
   lifetime for the internet", and suggests that "since the Identifier
   field allows 65,536 different values, hosts may be able to simply use
   unique identifiers independent of destination".  The above has been
   interpreted numerous times as a suggestion to employ per-destination
   or global counters for the generation of Identification values.
   While [RFC0791] does not suggest any flawed algorithm for the
   generation of Identification values, the specification omits a
   discussion of the security and privacy implications of predictable
   Identification values.  This has resulted in many IPv4

   implementations generating predictable fragment Identification values
   by means of a global counter, at least at some point in time.

   The IPv6 Identification was originally specified in [RFC1883].  It
   serves the same purpose as its IPv4 counterpart, with the only
   difference residing in the length of the corresponding field, and
   that while the IPv4 Identification field is part of the base IPv4
   header, in the IPv6 case it is part of the Fragment header (which may
   or may not be present in an IPv6 packet).  [RFC1883] states, in
   Section 4.5, that the Identification must be different than that of
   any other fragmented packet sent recently (within the maximum likely
   lifetime of a packet) with the same Source Address and Destination
   Address.  Subsequently, it notes that this requirement can be met by
   means of a wrap-around 32-bit counter that is incremented each time a
   packet must be fragmented, and that it is an implementation choice
   whether to use a global or a per-destination counter.  Thus, the
   implementation of the IPv6 Identification is similar to that of the
   IPv4 case, with the only difference that in the IPv6 case the
   suggestions to use simple counters is more explicit.  [RFC2460] was
   the first revision of the core IPv6 specification, and maintained the
   same text for the specification of the IPv6 Identification field.
   [RFC8200], the second revision of the core IPv6 specification,
   removes the suggestion from [RFC2460] to use a counter for the
   generation of IPv6 Identification values, and points to [RFC7739] for
   sample algorithms for their generation.

   September 1981:
      [RFC0791] specifies the interoperability requirements for IPv4
      Identification value, but does not perform a vulnerability
      assessment of this transient numeric identifier.

   December 1995:
      [RFC1883], the first specification of the IPv6 protocol, is
      published.  It suggests that a counter be used to generate the
      IPv6 Identification value, and notes that it is an implementation
      choice whether to maintain a single counter for the node or
      multiple counters, e.g., one for each of the node's possible
      source addresses, or one for each active (source address,
      destination address) combination.

   December 1998:
      [Sanfilippo1998a] finds that predictable IPv4 Identification
      values (generated by most popular implementations) can be
      leveraged to count the number of packets sent by a target node.
      [Sanfilippo1998b] explains how to leverage the same vulnerability
      to implement a port-scanning technique known as dumb/idle scan.  A
      tool that implements this attack is publicly released.

   December 1998:
      [RFC2460], a revision of the IPv6 specification, is published,
      obsoleting [RFC1883].  It maintains the same specification of the
      IPv6 Identification field as its predecessor ([RFC1883]).

   November 1999:
      [Sanfilippo1999] discusses how to leverage predictable IPv4
      Identification to uncover the rules of a number of firewalls.

   December 1998:
      OpenBSD implements randomization of the IPv4 Identification field
      [OpenBSD-IPv4-ID].  This feature eventually shipped with OpenBSD
      2.5.

   November 1999:
      [Bellovin2002] explains how the IPv4 Identification field can be
      exploited to count the number of systems behind a NAT.

   September 2002:
      [Fyodor2002] explains how to implement a stealth port-scanning
      technique by leveraging nodes that employ predictable IPv4
      Identification values.

   October 2003:
      OpenBSD implements randomization of the IPv6 Identification field
      [OpenBSD-IPv6-ID].  This feature eventually shipped with OpenBSD
      3.4.

   December 2003:
      [Zalewski2003] explains a technique to perform TCP data injection
      attack based on predictable IPv4 identification values which
      requires less effort than TCP injection attacks performed with
      bare TCP packets.

   November 2005:
      [Silbersack2005] discusses shortcoming in a number of techniques
      to mitigate predictable IPv4 Identification values.

   October 2007:
      [Klein2007] describes a weakness in the pseudo random number
      generator (PRNG) in use for the generation of the IP
      Identification by a number of operating systems.

   June 2011:
      [Gont2011] describes how to perform idle scan attacks in IPv6.

      Linux mitigates predictable IPv6 Identification values
      [RedHat2011] [SUSE2011] [Ubuntu2011].

   December 2011:
      [draft-gont-6man-predictable-fragment-id-00] describes the
      security implications of predictable IPv6 Identification values,
      and possible mitigations.  This document has the Intended Status
      of "Standards Track", with the intention to formally update
      [RFC2460], to introduce security and privacy requirements on IPv6
      Identification values.

   May 2012:
      [Gont2012] notes that some major IPv6 implementations still employ
      predictable IPv6 Identification values.

   March 2013:
      The 6man WG adopts [I-D.gont-6man-predictable-fragment-id], but
      changes the track to "BCP" (while still formally updating
      [RFC2460]), publishing the resulting document as
      [draft-ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id-00].

   June 2013:
      A patch that implements IPv6-based idle-scan in nmap is submitted
      [Morbitzer2013].

   December 2014:
      The 6man WG changes the Intended Status of
      [draft-ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id-01] to "Informational"
      and publishes it as [draft-ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id-02].
      As a result, it no longer formally updates [RFC2460].

   June 2015:
      [draft-ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id-08] notes that some
      popular host and router implementations still employ predictable
      IPv6 Identification values.

   February 2016:
      [RFC7739] (based on [I-D.ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id])
      analyzes the security and privacy implications of predictable IPv6
      Identification values, and provides guidance for selecting an
      algorithm to generate such values.  However, being published with
      the Intended Status of "Informational", it does not formally
      update [RFC2460].

   June 2016:
      [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis], revision of [RFC2460], removes the
      suggestion from RFC2460 to use a counter for the generation of

      IPv6 Identification values, but does not perform a vulnerability
      assessment of the generation of IPv6 Identification values.

   July 2017:
      [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis] is finally published as [RFC8200],
      obsoleting [RFC2460], and pointing to [RFC7739] for sample
      algorithms for the generation of IPv6 Fragment Identification
      values.

   June 2019:
      [IPID-DEV] notes that the IPv6 ID generators of two popular
      operating systems are flawed.

6.  TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs)

   [RFC0793] suggests that the choice of the ISN of a connection is not
   arbitrary, but aims to reduce the chances of a stale segment from
   being accepted by a new incarnation of a previous connection.
   [RFC0793] suggests the use of a global 32-bit ISN generator that is
   incremented by 1 roughly every 4 microseconds.  However, as a matter
   of fact, protection against stale segments from a previous
   incarnation of the connection is enforced by preventing the creation
   of a new incarnation of a previous connection before 2*MSL have
   passed since a segment corresponding to the old incarnation was last
   seen (where "MSL" is the "Maximum Segment Lifetime" [RFC0793]).  This
   is accomplished by the TIME-WAIT state and TCP's "quiet time" concept
   (see Appendix B of [RFC1323]).  Based on the assumption that ISNs are
   monotonically increasing across connections, many stacks (e.g.,
   4.2BSD-derived) use the ISN of an incoming SYN segment to perform
   "heuristics" that enable the creation of a new incarnation of a
   connection while the previous incarnation is still in the TIME-WAIT
   state (see p. 945 of [Wright1994]).  This avoids an interoperability
   problem that may arise when a node establishes connections to a
   specific TCP end-point at a high rate [Silbersack2005].

   The interoperability requirements for TCP ISNs are probably not as
   clearly spelled out as one would expect.  Furthermore, the suggestion
   of employing a global counter in [RFC0793] negatively affects the
   security and privacy properties of the protocol.

   September 1981:
      [RFC0793], suggests the use of a global 32-bit ISN generator,
      whose lower bit is incremented roughly every 4 microseconds.
      However, such an ISN generator makes it trivial to predict the ISN
      that a TCP instance will use for new connections, thus allowing a
      variety of attacks against TCP.

   February 1985:

      [Morris1985] was the first to describe how to exploit predictable
      TCP ISNs for forging TCP connections that could then be leveraged
      for trust relationship exploitation.

   April 1989:
      [Bellovin1989] discussed the security considerations for
      predictable ISNs (along with a range of other protocol-based
      vulnerabilities).

   February 1995:
      [Shimomura1995] reported a real-world exploitation of the attack
      described in 1985 (ten years before) in [Morris1985].

   May 1996:
      [RFC1948] was the first IETF effort, authored by Steven Bellovin,
      to address predictable TCP ISNs.  The same concept specified in
      this document for TCP ISNs was later proposed for TCP ephemeral
      ports [RFC6056], TCP Timestamps, and eventually even IPv6
      Interface Identifiers [RFC7217].

   July 1996:
      OpenBSD implements TCP ISN randomization based on random
      increments (please see Appendix A.2 of
      [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation]) [OpenBSD-TCP-ISN-I].  The
      feature eventually shipped with OpenBSD 2.0.

   December 2000:
      OpenBSD implements TCP ISN randomization using simple
      randomization (please see Section 7.1 of
      [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation]) [OpenBSD-TCP-ISN-R].  The
      feature eventually shipped with OpenBSD 2.9.

   March 2001:
      [Zalewski2001] provides a detailed analysis of statistical
      weaknesses in some ISN generators, and includes a survey of the
      algorithms in use by popular TCP implementations.

   May 2001:
      Vulnerability advisories [CERT2001] [USCERT2001] are released
      regarding statistical weaknesses in some ISN generators, affecting
      popular TCP/IP implementations.

   March 2002:
      [Zalewski2002] updates and complements [Zalewski2001].  It
      concludes that "while some vendors [...] reacted promptly and

      flawed solution that apparently was not tested using a known
      approach" [Zalewski2002].

   June 2007:
      OpenBSD implements TCP ISN randomization based on the algorithm
      specified in [RFC1948] (currently obsoleted by [RFC6528]) for the
      TCP endpoint that performs the active open, while keeping the
      simple randomization scheme for the endpoint performing the
      passive open [OpenBSD-TCP-ISN-H].  This provides monotonically-
      increasing ISNs for the client side (allowing the BSD heuristics
      to work as expected), while avoiding any patterns in the ISN
      generation for the server side.  This feature eventually shipped
      with OpenBSD 4.2.

   February 2012:
      [RFC6528], published 27 years after Morris' original work
      [Morris1985], formally updates [RFC0793] to mitigate predictable
      TCP ISNs.

   August 2014:
      [I-D.eddy-rfc793bis-04], the upcoming revision of the core TCP
      protocol specification, incorporates the algorithm specified in
      [RFC6528] as the recommended algorithm for TCP ISN generation.

7.  IPv6 Interface Identifiers (IIDs)

   IPv6 Interface Identifiers can be generated in multiple ways: SLAAC
   [RFC4862], DHCPv6 [RFC8415], and manual configuration.  This section
   focuses on Interface Identifiers resulting from SLAAC.

   The Interface Identifier of stable (traditional) IPv6 addresses
   resulting from SLAAC have traditionally resulted in the underlying
   link-layer address being embedded in the IID.  At the time, employing
   the underlying link-layer address for the IID was seen as a
   convenient way to obtain a unique address.  However, recent awareness
   about the security and privacy properties of this approach [RFC7707]
   [RFC7721] has led to the replacement of this flawed scheme with an
   alternative one [RFC7217] [RFC8064] that does not negatively affect
   the security and privacy properties of the protocol.

   January 1997:
      [RFC2073] specifies the syntax of IPv6 global addresses (referred
      to as "An IPv6 Provider-Based Unicast Address Format" at the
      time), consistent with the IPv6 addressing architecture specified
      in [RFC1884].  Hosts are recommended to "generate addresses using
      link-specific addresses as Interface ID such as 48 bit IEEE-802
      MAC addresses".

Internet-Draft           Predictable Numeric IDs            January 2021


   July 1998:
      [RFC2374] specifies "An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast Address
      Format" (obsoleting [RFC2373]) changing the size of the Interface
      ID to 64 bits, and specifies that that IIDs must be constructed in
      IEEE EUI-64 format.  How such identifiers are constructed becomes
      specified in the appropriate "IPv6 over <link>" specification such
      as "IPv6 over Ethernet".

   January 2001:
      [RFC3041] recognizes the problem of network activity correlation,
      and specifies temporary addresses.  Temporary addresses are to be
      used along with stable addresses.

   August 2003:
      [RFC3587] obsoletes [RFC2374], making the TLA/NLA structure
      historic.  The syntax and recommendations for the traditional
      stable IIDs remain unchanged, though.

   February 2006:
      [RFC4291] is published as the latest "IP Version 6 Addressing
      Architecture", requiring the IIDs of the traditional (stable)
      autoconfigured addresses to employ the Modified EUI-64 format.
      The details of constructing such interface identifiers are defined
      in the appropriate "IPv6 over <link>" specifications.

   March 2008:
      [RFC5157] provides hints regarding how patterns in IPv6 addresses
      could be leveraged for the purpose of address scanning.

   December 2011:
      [draft-gont-6man-stable-privacy-addresses-00] notes that the
      traditional scheme for generating stable addresses allows for
      address scanning, and also does not prevent active node tracking.
      It also specifies an alternative algorithm meant to replace IIDs
      based on Modified EUI-64 format identifiers.

   November 2012:
      The 6man WG adopts [I-D.gont-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] as a
      working group item (as
      [draft-ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses-00]).  However, the
      document no longer formally updates [RFC4291], and therefore the
      specified algorithm no longer formally replaces the Modified
      EUI-64 format identifiers.

   February 2013:
      An address-scanning tool (scan6 of [IPv6-Toolkit]) that leverages
      IPv6 address patterns is released [Gont2013].

      [I-D.cooper-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy] elaborates on
      the security and privacy properties of all known algorithms for
      generating IPv6 IIDs.

   January 2014:
      The 6man WG publishes [draft-ietf-6man-default-iids-00]
      ("Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers"),
      recommending [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] for the
      generation of stable addresses.

   April 2014:
      [RFC7217] (formerly [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses]) is
      published, specifying "A Method for Generating Semantically Opaque
      Interface Identifiers with IPv6 Stateless Address
      Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)" as an alternative to (but *not*
      replacement of) Modified EUI-64 format IIDs.

      [I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning]), about "Network

      [draft-gont-6man-non-stable-iids-00] is published, with the goal
      of specifying requirements for non-stable addresses, and updating

   May 2016:
      [draft-gont-6man-address-usage-recommendations-00] is published,

      privacy properties, and meaning to eventually provide advice in
      this area.

   February 2017:
      The 6man WG publishes [RFC8064] ("Recommendation on Stable IPv6
      Interface Identifiers") (formerly [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids]),
      with requirements for stable addresses and a recommendation to
      employ [RFC7217] for the generation of stable addresses.  It
      formally updates a large number of RFCs.

8.  NTP Reference IDs (REFIDs)

   NTP [RFC5905] Reference IDs are employed to avoid degree-one timing
   loops in scenarios where two NTP peers are (mutually) the time source
   of each other.

   June 2010:
      [RFC5905], "Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and
      Algorithms Specification" is published.  It specifies that for NTP
      peers with stratum higher than 1 the REFID embeds the IPv4 Address
      of the time source or an MD5 hash of the IPv6 address of the time
      source.

   July 2016:
      [draft-stenn-ntp-not-you-refid-00] is published, describing the
      information leakage produced via the NTP REFID.  It proposes that
      NTP returns a special REFID when a packet employs an IP Source
      Address that is not believed to be a current NTP peer, but
      otherwise generates and returns the traditional REFID.  It is
      subsequently adopted by the NTP WG as
      [I-D.ietf-ntp-refid-updates].

   April 2019:
      [Gont-NTP] notes that the proposed fix specified in
      [draft-ietf-ntp-refid-updates-00] is, at the very least, sub-
      optimal.

9.  Transport Protocol Ephemeral Port Numbers

   Most (if not all) transport protocols employ "port numbers" to
   demultiplex packets to the corresponding transport protocol
   instances.

   August 1980:
      [RFC0768] notes that the UDP source port is optional and
      identifies the port of the sending process.  It does not specify
      interoperability requirements for source port selection, nor does
      it suggest possible ways to select port numbers.  Most popular
      implementations end up selecting source ports from a system-wide
      global counter.

   September 1981:
      [RFC0793] (the TCP specification) essentially describes the use of
      port numbers, and specifies that port numbers should result in a
      unique socket pair (local address, local port, remote address,
      remote port).  How ephemeral ports (i.e. port numbers for "active
      opens") are selected, and the port range from which they are
      selected, are left unspecified.

   July 1996:
      OpenBSD implements ephemeral port randomization [OpenBSD-PR].  The
      feature eventually shipped with OpenBSD 2.0.

   July 2008:
      The CERT Coordination Centre published details of what became
      known as the "Kaminsky Attack" [VU-800113] on the DNS.  The attack
      exploited the lack of source port randomisation in many major DNS
      implementations to perform cache poisoning in an effective and
      practical manner.

   January 2009:
      [RFC5452] mandates the use of port randomization for DNS
      resolvers, and mandates that implementations must randomize ports
      from the range (53 or 1024, and above) or the largest possible
      port range.  It does not recommend possible algorithms for port
      randomization, although the document specifically targets DNS
      resolvers, for which a simple port randomization suffices (e.g.
      Algorithm 1 of [RFC6056]).  This document led to the
      implementation of port randomization in the DNS resolver
      themselves, rather than in the underlying transport-protocols.

   January 2011:
      [RFC6056] notes that many TCP and UDP implementations result in
      predictable port numbers, and also notes that many implementations
      select port numbers from a small portion of the whole port number



Gont & Arce               Expires July 17, 2021                [Page 15]

      space.  It recommends the implementation and use of ephemeral port
      randomization, proposes a number of possible algorithms for port
      randomization, and also recommends to randomize port numbers over
      the range 1024-65535.

   March 2016:
      [NIST-NTP] reports a non-normal distribution of the ephemeral port
      numbers employed by the NTP clients of an Internet Time Service.

   April 2019:
      [I-D.gont-ntp-port-randomization] notes that some NTP
      implementations employ the NTP service port (123) as the local
      port for non-symmetric modes, and aims to update the NTP
      specification to recommend port randomization in such cases, in
      line with [RFC6056].  The proposal experiences some push-back in
      the relevant working group (NTP WG) [NTP-PORTR], but is finally
      adopted as a working group item as
      [I-D.ietf-ntp-port-randomization].

   September 2019:
      [I-D.ietf-ntp-port-randomization] passes its WGLC.

10.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document analyzes the timeline of the specification and
   implementation of the transient numeric identifiers of some sample
   IETF protocols, and how the security and privacy properties of such
   protocols have been affected as a result of it.  It provides concrete
   evidence that advice in this area is warranted.

   [I-D.gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations] formally requires protocol
   specifications to specify the interoperability requirements for their
   transient numeric identifiers, to do a warranted vulnerability
   assessment of such transient numeric identifiers, and to recommend
   possible algorithms for their generation, such that the
   interoperability requirements are complied with, while any negative
   security and privacy properties of these transient numeric
   identifiers are mitigated.

   [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation] analyzes and categorizes
   transient numeric identifiers based on their interoperability
   requirements and their associated failure modes, and recommends

   possible algorithms that can comply with those requirements without
   negatively affecting the security and privacy properties of the
   corresponding protocols.
