 IANA registrations of SDP 'proto' attribute for transporting RTP Media
                  over TCP under various RTP profiles.
              draft-ietf-mmusic-proto-iana-registration-06

Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification establishes a
   registry of profile names for use by higher-level control protocols,
   such as the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to refer to the
   transport methods.  This specification describes the following new
   SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting RTP Media over
   TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/
   SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.

1.  Overview

   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides end-to-end network
   transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time
   data such as audio, video over multicast or unicast network services.
   The data transport is augmented by RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), to
   allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large
   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
   functionality.

   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], provides a general-
   purpose format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or
   invitations.  TCP-Based Media Transport in the SDP [RFC4145],
   specifies a general mechanism for describing media transport over
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) using SDP with [RFC4571] defining
   a method for framing RTP and RTCP packets [RFC3550] onto a
   connection-oriented transport (such as TCP).  Connection-Oriented
   Media Transport over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in
   the SDP [RFC4572], extends [RFC4145] for describing TCP-based media
   streams that are protected using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246].

   This specification describes additional SDP transport protocol
   identifiers for transporting RTP Media over TCP as defined in
   Section 3.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Identifiers

   The 'm=' line in SDP specifies, among other items, the transport
   protocol (identified via the 'proto' field) to be used for the media
   in the session.  See the "MediaDescriptions" section of SDP [RFC4566]
   for a discussion on transport protocol identifiers.

   The following is the format for an 'm=' line, as specified in
   [RFC4566]:

             m=<media> <port> <proto> <fmt> ...

3.1.  TCP/RTP/AVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/AVPF transport describes RTP Media with RTCP-based
   Feedback [RFC4585] over TCP.

   It is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/AVPF stream over the TCP transport is realized using the
      framing method defined in [RFC4571].

3.2.  TCP/RTP/SAVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/SAVP transport describes Secure RTP (SRTP) Media
   [RFC3711] over TCP.

   It is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/SAVP stream over the TCP transport is realized using the
      framing method defined in [RFC4571].

3.3.  TCP/RTP/SAVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/SAVPF transport describes Secure RTP Media with RTCP-
   based Feedback [RFC5124] over TCP.

   It is realized as described below:

Internet-Draft           SDP Proto Registrations           February 2016


   o  RTP/SAVPF stream over the TCP transport is realized using the
      framing method defined in [RFC4571].

3.4.  TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP transport describes Secure RTP Media [RFC3711]
   using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) SRTP (DTLS-SRTP)
   [RFC5764] over TCP.

   It is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/SAVP using DTLS-based key establishment is realized according
      to the procedures defined in [RFC5764]; and

   o  [RFC4571] framing is used to transport DTLS-SRTP packets over TCP.

3.5.  TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF transport describes Secure RTP Media with
   RTCP-based Feedback [RFC5124] using DTLS-SRTP over TCP.

   It is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/SAVPF using DTLS-based key establishment is realized according
      to the procedures defined in [RFC5764]; and

   o  [RFC4571] framing is used to transport DTLS-SRTP packets over TCP.

3.6.  TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP transport describes RTP Media on top of TLS over
   TCP.

   It is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/AVP packets are framed using the procedures from [RFC4571];
      and

   o  [RFC4571] framed RTP/AVP packets are transported as Application
      data messages over the TLS association setup using the procedures
      from [RFC4572].

3.7.  TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF transport describes RTP Media with RTCP-based
   Feedback [RFC5124] on top of TLS over TCP.

   It is realized as described below:

Internet-Draft           SDP Proto Registrations           February 2016


   o  RTP/AVPF packets are framed using the procedures from [RFC4571];
      and

   o  [RFC4571] framed RTP/AVPF packets are transported as Application
      data messages over the TLS association setup using the procedures
      from [RFC4572].

4.  ICE Considerations

   When procedures from [RFC6544] are used to setup Interactive
   Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] candidates for a TCP
   transport, the framing mechanism from [RFC4571] MUST be used for
   framing Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) packets (for keep-
   alives, consent checks), as defined in section 3 of [RFC6544].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol
   identifiers :'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF',
   'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP',
   'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF', as defined in Section 3.  These proto values
   should be registered by the IANA under the "proto" subregistry in the
   "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.

   [To RFC Editor: Remove this note prior to publication.  This
   registration should take place at the following location:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters/sdp-
   parameters.xhtml#sdp-parameters-2.  Replace XXXX in the table below
   with the assigned number of this RFC]

6.  Security Considerations

   The new "proto" identifiers registered by this document in the SDP
   parameters registry maintained by IANA is primarily for use by the
   offer/answer model of the Session Description Protocol [RFC3264] for
   the negotiation and establishment of RTP based Media over the TCP
   transport.  This specification doesn't introduce any additional
   security considerations beyond those specified by the individual
   transport protocols identified in the "proto" identifiers and those
   detailed in Section 7 of [RFC4566].
