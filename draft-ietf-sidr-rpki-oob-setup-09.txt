       An Out-Of-Band Setup Protocol For RPKI Production Services
                   draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-oob-setup-09

Abstract

   This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of
   the RPKI provisioning and publication protocols between two parties.
   The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can
   be passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable means which
   provides acceptable data integrity and authentication.

   This setup protocol is not part of the provisioning or publication
   protocol, rather, it is intended to simplify configuration of these
   protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging keying material
   used to authenticate those relationships.

1.  Introduction

   This note describes a small XML-based out-of-band protocol used to
   set up relationships between parents and children in the RPKI
   provisioning protocol ([RFC6492]) and between publishers and
   repositories in the RPKI publication protocol
   ([I-D.ietf-sidr-publication]).

   The basic function of this protocol is public key exchange, in the
   form of self-signed X.509 certificates, but workshop experience has
   demonstrated that it's simpler for the user if we also bundle the
   other configuration information needed to bring up a new player into
   the messages used in the key exchange.

   The underlying transport for this protocol is deliberately
   unspecified.  It might be a USB stick, a web interface secured with

   conventional HTTPS, PGP-signed email, a T-shirt printed with a QR
   code, or a carrier pigeon.

   Since much of the purpose of this protocol is key exchange,
   authentication and integrity of the key exchange MUST be ensured via
   external means.  Typically such means will tie directly to a new or
   existing business relationship

2.  History

   The protocol described in this document grew out of a series of
   workshops held starting in 2010, at which it became clear that manual
   configuration of keying material and service URLs was both error
   prone and unnecessarily confusing.  The basic mechanism and semantics
   have been essentially unchanged since the earliest versions of the
   protocol, but there were several workshop-driven syntax changes and
   simplifications before the protocol made its way into the IETF, and a
   few more simplifications and minor extensions have occurred since
   that time.

3.  Overview of the BPKI

   Several protocols related to RPKI provisioning use signed CMS
   messages ([RFC5652]) to authenticate the underlying XML-based
   protocols.  Verification of these CMS messages requires X.509
   certificates.  The PKI that holds these certificates is distinct from
   the RPKI, and contains no RFC 3779 resources.  We refer to this as
   the "Business PKI" (BPKI), to distinguish it from the RPKI.  The "B"
   is a hint that the certificate relationships in the BPKI are likely
   to follow and become part of existing contractual relationships
   between the issuers and subjects of this PKI.

   The RPKI provisioning protocol does not dictate a particular
   structure for the BPKI, beyond the basic requirement that it be
   possible for one party to sign and the other party to verify the CMS
   messages.  This allows a certain amount of flexibility to allow an
   Internet registry to reuse an existing PKI as the BPKI if that makes
   sense in their context.

   In order to keep this protocol simple, we adopt a somewhat
   constrained model of the BPKI.  The first two operations in this
   protocol are an exchange of public keys between child and parent for
   use in the provisioning protocol, the latter two operations in this
   protocol are an exchange of public keys between publisher and
   repository for use in the publication protocol.  In each of these
   operations, the sending party includes its public key, in the form of
   a self-signed X.509 CA certificate.  The private keys corresponding
   to the exchanged certificates are not used to sign CMS messages



Austein                  Expires August 26, 2017                [Page 3]

   directly; instead, the exchanged CA certificates are the issuers of
   the BPKI end-entity (EE) certificates which will be included in the
   CMS messages and can be used, along with the exchanged certificates,
   to verify the CMS messages.

   Details of how to tie the exchanged certificates into an
   implementation's local BPKI are left to the implementation, but the
   recommended approach is to cross-certify the received public key and
   subject name under one's own BPKI, using a Basic Constraints
   extension with cA = TRUE, pathLenConstraint = 0, indicating that the
   cross-certified certificate is a CA certificate which is allowed to
   issue EE certificates but is not allowed to issue CA certificates.
   See section 4.2.1.9 of [RFC5280] for more information about the Basic
   Constraints extension.

   For example, suppose that Alice and Bob each have their own self-
   signed BPKI certificates:

             Issuer:       CN = Alice CA
             Subject:      CN = Alice CA
             Public Key:   [Alice CA Public Key]
             BasicConstraints: cA = TRUE

             Issuer:       CN = Bob CA
             Subject:      CN = Bob CA
             Public Key:   [Bob CA Public Key]
             BasicConstraints: cA = TRUE

   Alice sends Bob her self-signed BPKI certificate, and Bob cross-
   certifies its public key and subject name under Bob's own self-signed
   BPKI certificate:

             Issuer:       CN = Bob CA
             Subject:      CN = Alice CA
             Public Key:   [Alice CA Public Key]
             BasicConstraints: cA = TRUE, pathLenConstraint = 0

   Later, when Bob receives a CMS message from Alice, Bob can verify
   this message via a trust chain back to Bob's own trust anchor:

             Issuer:       CN = Alice CA
             Subject:      CN = Alice EE
             Public Key:   [Alice EE Public Key]

   A complete description of the certificates allowed here is beyond the
   scope of this document, as it is determined primarily by what is
   acceptable to the several other protocols for which this protocol is
   handling setup.  Furthermore, we expect the requirements to change



Austein                  Expires August 26, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           RPKI Out-Of-Band Setup            February 2017


   over time to track changes in cryptographic algorithms, required key
   length, and so forth.  Finally, since this protocol is restricted to
   setting up pairwise relationships, all that's really required is that
   the two parties involved in a particular conversation agree on what
   constitutes an acceptable certificate.

   All of that said, in practice, the certificates currently exchanged
   by this protocol at the time this document was written are what a
   reader familiar with the technology would probably expect: RSA keys
   with lengths in the 2048-4096 bit range, SHA-2 digests, and a few
   common X.509v3 extensions (principally Basic Constraints, Authority
   Key Identifier, and Subject Key Identifier).  Since the most likely
   usage is a cross-certification operation in which the recipient
   simply extracts the Subject Name and public key after checking the
   self-signature and discards the rest of the incoming certificate, the
   practical value of esoteric X.509v3 extensions is somewhat limited.

4.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All of the protocols configured by this setup protocol have their own
   terminology for their actors, but in the context of this protocol
   that terminology becomes somewhat confusing.  All of the players in
   this setup protocol issue certificates, are the subjects of other
   certificates, operate servers, and, in most cases, act as clients for
   one protocol or another.  Therefore, this note uses its own terms for
   the actors in this protocol.

   Child:  An entity acting in the client ("subject") role of the
      provisioning protocol defined in [RFC6492].

   Parent:  An entity acting in the server ("issuer") role of the
      provisioning protocol defined in [RFC6492].

   Publisher:  An entity acting in the client role of the publication
      protocol defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-publication].

   Repository:  An entity acting in the server role of the publication
      protocol defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-publication].

   Note that a given entity might act in more than one of these roles;
   for example, in one of the simplest cases, the child is the same
   entity as the publisher, while the parent is the same entity as the
   repository.

5.  Protocol Elements

   Each message in the protocol is a distinct XML element in the
   "http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/" XML namespace.

   The outermost XML element of each message contains a version
   attribute.  This document describes version 1 of the protocol.

   Appendix A is a [RelaxNG] schema for this protocol.  The schema is
   normative: in the event of a disagreement between the schema and the
   following textual description, the schema is authoritative.

   Since "1" is currently the only value allowed for the version
   attribute in the schema, an incorrect protocol version can be
   detected either by checking the version attribute directly or as a
   schema validation error.

5.1.  Common Protocol Elements

   Most messages contain, among other things, a self-signed BPKI X.509
   certificate.  These certificates are represented as XML elements
   whose text value is the Base64 text ([RFC4648] section 4, with line
   breaks within the Base64 text permitted but not required) encoding
   the DER representation of the X.509 certificate.

   A number of attributes contain "handles".  A handle in this protocol
   is a text string in the US-ASCII character set consisting of letters,
   digits, and the special characters "/", "-", and "_".  This protocol
   places no special semantics on the structure of these handles,
   although implementations might.  Handles are protocol elements, not
   necessarily meaningful to humans, thus the simplicity of a restricted
   character set makes more sense than the complex rules which would be
   needed for internationalized text.

   Most messages allow an optional "tag" attribute.  This is an opaque
   cookie supplied by the client in a particular exchange and echoed by
   the server; the intent is to simplify the process of matching a
   response received by the client with an outstanding request.

5.2.  Protocol Messages

   The core of this protocol consists of four message types,
   representing the basic request and response semantics needed to
   configure a RPKI engine to talk to its parent and its repository via
   the provisioning and publication protocols, respectively.

5.2.1.  <child_request/>

   The <child_request/> message is an initial setup request from a
   provisioning protocol child to its provisioning protocol parent.

   Fields in the <child_request/> message:

   version:  The version attribute specifies the protocol version.  This
      note describes protocol version 1.

   tag:  The child MAY include a "tag" attribute in the request message.

   child_handle:  The child_handle attribute is what the child calls
      itself.  This is just a hint from the child to the parent, the
      parent need not honor it.

   child_bpki_ta:  The <child_bpki_ta/> element is the child's BPKI
      identity, a self-signed X.509 BPKI certificate, encoded in Base64.

      This CA certificate will be the issuer of the BPKI EE certificates
      corresponding to private keys that the child will use when sending
      provisioning protocol messages to the parent.

   <child_request

5.2.2.  <parent_response/>

   The <parent_response/> message is a response from a provisioning
   protocol parent to a provisioning protocol child that had previously
   sent a <child_request/> message.

   Fields in the <parent_response/> message:

   version:  The version attribute specifies the protocol version.  This
      note describes protocol version 1.

   tag:  If the <child_request/> message included a "tag" attribute, the
      parent MUST include an identical "tag" attribute in the

      <parent_response/> message; if the request did not include a tag
      attribute, the response MUST NOT include a tag attribute either.

   service_uri:  The service_uri attribute contains an HTTP or HTTPS URL
      ([RFC7230]) that the child should contact for up-down ([RFC6492])
      service.

   child_handle:  The child_handle attribute is the parent's name for
      the child.  This MAY match the child_handle from the
      <child_request/> message.  If they do not match, the parent wins,
      because the parent gets to dictate the names in the provisioning
      protocol.  This value is the sender field in provisioning protocol
      request messages and the recipient field in provisioning protocol
      response messages.

   parent_handle:  The parent_handle attribute is the parent's name for
      itself.  This value is the recipient field in provisioning
      protocol request messages and the sender field in provisioning
      protocol response messages.

   parent_bpki_ta:  The <parent_bpki_ta/> element is the parent's BPKI
      identity, a self-signed X.509 BPKI certificate.

      This certificate is the issuer of the BPKI EE certificates
      corresponding to private keys that the parent will use to sign
      provisioning protocol messages to the child.

   offer:  If an <offer/> element is present, the parent is offering
      publication service to the child.  The <offer/> element, if
      present, is empty.

   referral:  If <referral/> elements are present, they suggest third-
      party publication services which the child might use, and contain:

      referrer:  A referrer attribute, containing the handle by which
         the publication repository knows the parent,

      contact_uri:  An optional contact_uri attribute that the child may
         be able to follow for more information, and

      Authorization token:  The text of the <referral/> element is the
         Base64 encoding of a signed authorization token granting the
         child the right to use a portion of the parent's namespace at
         the publication repository in question.  See Section 5.3 for
         details on the authorization token.

   A parent is unlikely to need to send both <offer> and <referral>
   elements, but strictly speaking they are not mutually exclusive, so a

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2.3.  <publisher_request/>

   The <publisher_request/> message is a setup request from a publisher
   to a repository.  Generally this will not take place until after the
   publisher has set up the provisioning protocol via a <child_request/>
   / <parent_response/> exchange: in particular, the <referral> sub-
   element here requires an <authorization/> token provided by the
   provisioning protocol exchange.

   Fields in the <publisher_request/> message:

   version:  The version attribute specifies the protocol version.  This
      note describes protocol version 1.

   tag:  The publisher MAY include a "tag" attribute in the request
      message.

   publisher_handle:  The publisher_handle attribute is the publisher's
      name for itself.  This is just a hint, the repository need not
      honor it.

   publisher_bpki_ta:  The <publisher_bpki_ta/> element is the
      publisher's BPKI identity, a self-signed X.509 BPKI certificate.
      This certificate is the issuer of the BPKI EE certificates
      corresponding to private keys that the publisher will use to sign
      publication protocol messages to the repository.

   referral:  If a <referral/> element is present, it contains:

      referrer:  A referrer attribute containing the publication handle
         of the referring parent, and

      Authorization token:  The text of the <referral/> element is the
         Base64 encoding of a signed authorization token granting the
         publisher the right to use a portion of its parent's namespace
         at this repository.  See Section 5.3 for details on the
         authorization token.

      These fields are copies of values that a parent provided to the
      child in the <parent_response/> message (see Section 5.2.2).  The
      referrer attribute is present to aid lookup of the corresponding
      certificate by the repository.  Note that the repository operator
      makes the final decision on whether to grant publication service
      to the prospective publisher.  The <referral/> element just
      conveys a parent's grant of permission to use a portion of that
      parent's namespace.

5.2.4.  <repository_response/>

   The <repository_response/> message is a repository's response to a
   publisher which has previously sent a <publisher_request/> message.

   Fields in the <repository_response/> message:

   version:  The version attribute specifies the protocol version.  This
      note describes protocol version 1.

   tag:  If the <publisher_request/> message included a "tag" attribute,
      the repository MUST include an identical "tag" attribute in the
      <repository_response/> message; if the request did not include a
      tag attribute, the response MUST NOT include a tag attribute
      either.

   service_uri:  The service_uri attribute contains an HTTP or HTTPS URL
      ([RFC7230]) that the publisher should contact for publication
      service ([I-D.ietf-sidr-publication]).

   publisher_handle:  The publisher_handle attribute is the repository's
      name for the publisher.  This may or may not match the
      publisher_handle attribute in the publisher's <publisher_request/>
      message.

   sia_base:  The sia_base attribute is the rsync:// URI for the base of
      the publication space allocated to the publisher.

   rrdp_notification_uri:  The optional rrdp_notification_uri attribute
      is the URI for the RRDP notification file covering the publication
      space allocated to the publisher ([I-D.ietf-sidr-delta-protocol]).

   repository_bpki_ta:  The <repository_bpki_ta/> element is the
      repository's BPKI identity, a self-signed X.509 BPKI certificate.

5.3.  <authorization/>

   The <authorization/> element is a separate message which is signed
   with CMS, then included as the Base64 content of <referral/> elements
   in other messages.

   The eContentType for the signed CMS message is id-ct-xml ([RFC6492]).

   Fields in the <authorization/> element:

   version:  The version attribute specifies the protocol version.  This
      note describes protocol version 1.

   authorized_sia_base:  The value of the authorized_sia_base attribute
      is the rsync:// URI of the base of the namespace which the
      referrer is delegating.

   BPKI TA:  The text of the <authorization/> element is the identity of
      the entity to whom the referrer is delegating the portion of the
      namespace named in the authorized_sia_base attribute, represented
      as a Base64-encoded self-signed X.509 BPKI certificate.

5.4.  <error/>

   The <error/> element is an optional message which can be used in
   response to any of the core protocol messages described in
   Section 5.2.

   Whether an <error/> element is an appropriate way to signal errors
   back to the sender of a protocol message depends on details of the
   implementation which are outside this specification.  For example, if
   this protocol is embedded in a web portal interface which is designed
   to let a human being upload and download these messages via upload
   and download forms, a human-readable error message may be more
   appropriate.  On the other hand, a portal intended to be driven by a
   robotic client might well want to use an <error/> message to signal
   errors.  Similar arguments apply to non-web encapsulations (email,
   USB stick, ...); the primary factor is likely to be whether the
   implementation expects the error to be handled by a human being or by
   a program.

   Fields in the <error/> message:

   version:  The version attribute specifies the protocol version.  This
      note describes protocol version 1.

   reason:  The reason attribute contains a code indicating what was
      wrong with the message.  This version of the protocol defines the
      following codes:

      syntax-error:  Receiver could not parse the offending message.

      authentication-failure:  Receiver could not authenticate the
         offending message.

      refused:  Receiver refused to perform the requested action.

   Offending message:  The <error/> element contains a verbatim copy of
      the message to which this error applies.

6.  Protocol Walk-Through

   This section walks through a few simple examples of the protocol in
   use, and stars our old friends, Alice, Bob, and Carol.  In this
   example, Alice is the root of a RPKI tree, Bob wants to get address
   and ASN resources from Alice, and Carol wants to get some of those
   resources in turn from Bob.  Alice offers publication service, which
   is used by all three.

   Alice, Bob, and Carol each generate his or her own self-signed BPKI
   certificate.

   Bob constructs a <child_request/> message and sends it to Alice:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   <child_request
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/"
       version="1"
       child_handle="Bob">
     <child_bpki_ta>
       R29kIGlzIHJlYWwgdW5sZXNzIGRlY2xhcmVkIGludGVnZXI=
     </child_bpki_ta>
   </child_request>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   o  Bob's preferred handle is "Bob", so Bob uses that when setting
      child_handle.

   o  <child_bpki_ta/> is Bob's self-signed BPKI certificate.

   Alice replies with a <parent_response/> message, but Alice already
   has 41 other children named Bob, so she calls this one "Bob-42".

   Alice's provisioning protocol server happens to use a RESTful URL
   scheme so that it can find the expected validation context for the
   provisioning protocol CMS message just by looking at the URL, so the
   service URL she provides to Bob includes both her name and Bob's.
   Alice offers publication service, so she offers to let Bob use it;
   Alice doesn't have to do this, she could just omit this and leave Bob
   to find publication service on his own, but Alice is trying to be
   helpful to her customer Bob.  Bob doesn't have to accept Alice's
   offer, but may choose to do so.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   <parent_response
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/"
       version="1"

     <offer/>
   </parent_response>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   o  <parent_bpki_ta/> is Alice's own self-signed BPKI certificate.

   Bob receives Alice's <parent_response/> and extracts the fields Bob's
   RPKI engine will need to know about (child_handle, parent_handle,
   service_uri, and <parent_bpki_ta/>).  Bob also sees the repository
   offer, decides to take Alice up on this offer, and constructs a
   <publisher_request/> message accordingly:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   <publisher_request
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/"
       version="1"
       tag="A0001"

     </publisher_bpki_ta>
   </publisher_request>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Alice receives Bob's request to use Alice's publication service,
   decides to honor the offer she made, and sends back a
   <repository_response/> message in response.  Alice recognizes Bob as
   one of her own children, because she's already seen Bob's self-signed

   BPKI certificate, so she allocates publication space to Bob under her
   own publication space, so that relying parties who rsync her products
   will pick up Bob's products automatically without needing an
   additional fetch operation.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   <repository_response
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/"
       version="1"
       tag="A0001"
       service_uri="http://a.example/publication/Alice/Bob-42"
       publisher_handle="Alice/Bob-42"
       sia_base="rsync://a.example/rpki/Alice/Bob-42/"

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Bob should now have everything he needs to talk to Alice both for
   provisioning and for publication.

   A more interesting case is Bob's child, Carol.  Carol wants to get
   her resources from Bob, and, like Bob, does not particularly want to
   operate a publication service.  Bob doesn't have a publication
   service of his own to offer, but he can refer Carol to Alice, along
   with his permission for Carol to use a portion of the namespace that
   Alice gave him.

   Carol's <child_request/> to Bob looks very similar to Bob's earlier
   request to Alice:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   <child_request
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/"
       version="1"
       child_handle="Carol">
     <child_bpki_ta>
       SSd2ZSBoYWQgZnVuIGJlZm9yZS4gIFRoaXMgaXNuJ3QgaXQu
     </child_bpki_ta>
   </child_request>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Bob's <parent_response/> to Carol also looks a lot like Alice's
   response to Bob, except that Bob includes a <referral/> element
   instead of an <offer/> element.  Carol is an only child, so Bob
   leaves her name alone:

     </referral>
   </parent_response>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Bob's response includes a <referral/> element with a referrer
   attribute of "Alice/Bob-42", since that's Bob's name to Alice's
   repository.  The Base64-encoded authorization token is an
   <authorization/> element in a CMS message that can be verified
   against Bob's self-signed BPKI certificate, using a BPKI EE
   certificate included in the CMS wrapper.  The <authorization/> text
   is Carol's self-signed BPKI certificate; Bob's signature over this
   element indicates Bob's permission for Carol to use the indicated
   portion of Bob's publication space.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   <authorization
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/"

     SSd2ZSBoYWQgZnVuIGJlZm9yZS4gIFRoaXMgaXNuJ3QgaXQu
   </authorization>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Carol, not wanting to have to run a publication service, presents
   Bob's referral to Alice in the hope that Alice will let Carol use
   Alice's publication service.  So Carol constructs a
   <publisher_request/> message including the referral information
   received from Bob, and sends it all to Alice:

       R28sIGxlbW1pbmdzLCBnbyE=
     </referral>
   </publisher_request>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Alice sees the signed authorization token Bob gave to Carol, checks
   its signature, and unpacks it.  When the signature proves valid and
   the contained BPKI TA matches Carol's, Alice knows that Bob is
   willing to let Carol use a portion of Bob's namespace.  Given this,
   Alice is willing to provide publication service to Carol in the
   subtree allocated by Bob for this purpose, so Alice sends back a
   <repository_response/>:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   <repository_response
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/rpki-setup/"
       version="1"
       tag="A0002"
       service_uri="http://a.example/publication/Alice/Bob-42/Carol"
       publisher_handle="Alice/Bob-42/Carol"

     </repository_bpki_ta>
   </repository_response>
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Once Carol receives this response, Carol should be good to go.

   In theory the publication referral mechanism can extend indefinitely
   (for example, Carol can refer her child Dave to Alice for publication
   service and it should all work).  In practice, this has not yet been
   implemented, much less tested.  In order to keep the protocol
   relatively simple, we've deliberately ignored perverse cases such as
   Bob being willing to refer Carol to Alice but not wanting Carol to be
   allowed to refer Dave to Alice.

   Any RPKI operator is free to run their own publication service should
   they feel a need to do so, and a child need not accept any particular
   <offer/> or <referral/>.  In general, having a smaller number of
   larger publication repositories is probably good for overall system
   performance, because it will tend to reduce the number of distinct
   repositories from which each relying party will need to fetch, but
   the decision on where to publish is up to individual RPKI CA
   operators and out of scope for this protocol.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   As stated in Section 1, the basic function of this protocol is an
   exchange of public keys to be used as BPKI trust anchors.  Integrity
   and authentication of these exchanges MUST be ensured via external
   mechanisms deliberately left unspecified in this protocol.
