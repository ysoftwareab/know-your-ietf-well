INTERNET-DRAFT       RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802         30 July 2007


1.  Introduction

   In situations where it is desirable to centrally manage
   authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) for IEEE 802
   [IEEE-802] networks, deployment of a backend authentication and
   accounting server is desirable.  In such situations, it is expected
   that IEEE 802 authenticators will function as AAA clients.

   RFC 3580 [RFC3580] defined guidelines for the use of the Remote
   Authentication Dialin User Service (RADIUS) within networks utilizing
   IEEE 802 local area networks.  This document defines additional
   attributes suitable for usage by IEEE 802 authenticators acting as
   AAA clients.  The attributes defined in this document are usable both
   within RADIUS and Diameter.

1.1.  Terminology

This document uses the following terms:

Access Point (AP)
          A Station that provides access to the distribution services
          via the wireless medium for associated Stations.

Association
          The service used to establish Access Point/Station mapping and
          enable Station invocation of the distribution system services.

authenticator
          An authenticator is an entity that require authentication from
          the supplicant.  The authenticator may be connected to the
          supplicant at the other end of a point-to-point LAN segment or
          wireless link.

authentication server
          An authentication server is an entity that provides an
          authentication service to an authenticator.  This service
          verifies from the credentials provided by the supplicant, the
          claim of identity made by the supplicant.

Station (STA)
          Any device that contains an IEEE 802.11 conformant medium
          access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to the
          wireless medium (WM).

Supplicant
          A supplicant is an entity that is being authenticated by an
          authenticator.  The supplicant may be connected to the
          authenticator at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment or

          802.11 wireless link.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  RADIUS attributes

2.1.  Allowed-Called-Station-Id

   Description

      The Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute allows the RADIUS server
      to specify which Called-Station-Ids and networks the user is
      allowed to access.  One or more Allowed-Called-Station-Id
      attributes MAY be included in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request
      packet.  A summary of the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute
      format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to
      right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Length       |            String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code

      TBD

   Length

      >=3

   String

      The String field is one or more octets, containing the layer 2
      endpoint that the user's call is allowed to be terminated on, as
      specified in the definition of Called-Station-Id in [RFC2865]
      Section 5.30 and [RFC3580] Section 3.20.  In the case of IEEE 802,
      the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute is used to store the
      Medium Access Control (MAC) address in ASCII format (upper case
      only), with octet values separated by a "-".  Example:
      "00-10-A4-23-19-C0".  Where restrictions on both the network and



Aboba & Malinen             Proposed Standard                   [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT       RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802         30 July 2007


      authenticator MAC address usage are intended, the network name
      MUST be appended to the authenticator MAC address, separated from
      the MAC address with a ":".  Example "00-10-A4-23-19-C0:AP1".
      Where no MAC address restriction is intended, the MAC address
      field MUST be omitted, but the ":" and network name fields MUST be
      included.  Example ":AP1".  Within IEEE 802.11 [IEEE-802.11], the
      SSID constitutes the network name; within IEEE 802.1af
      [IEEE-802.1af], the Network Identifier (NID) constitutes the
      network name.

      If the user attempts to connect to the NAS from a Called-Station-
      Id that does not match one of the Allowed-Called-Station-Id
      attributes, then the user MUST NOT be permitted to access the
      network.

      The Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute is useful in the following
      situations:

[1]       Where users can connect to a NAS without an Access-Request
          being sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server (e.g. where key
          caching is supported within IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.1af).

[2]       Where pre-authentication may be supported (e.g.  IEEE 802.1X
          pre-authentication).  In this situation, the network name
          typically will not be included in a Called-Station-Id
          Attribute within the Access-Request, so that the RADIUS server
          will not be able to make a decision whether to allow access to
          a particular network.

   In these situations, it can be desirable for the RADIUS server to
   restrict usage of key cache entries.

2.2.  EAP-Key-Name

   Description

      The EAP-Key-Name Attribute, defined in [RFC4072], contains the EAP
      Session-Id, as described in [KEYFRAME].  Exactly how this
      Attribute is used depends on the link layer in question.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  An EAP-
      Key-Name Attribute MAY be included within Access-Request, Access-
      Accept and CoA-Request packets.  A summary of the EAP-Key-Name
      Attribute format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from
      left to right.

   Code

      102 [RFC4072]

   Length

      >=2

   String

      The String field, when present, is one or more octets, containing
      the EAP Session-Id, as defined in [KEYFRAME].  Since the NAS
      operates as a pass-through in EAP, it cannot know the EAP Session-
      Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As a result, an
      EAP-Key-Name Attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST NOT contain
      any data.  A RADIUS server receiving an Access-Request with an
      EAP-Key-Name Attribute containing data MUST silently discard the
      Attribute.  In addition, the RADIUS server SHOULD only include
      this Attribute in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request if an EAP-Key-
      Name Attribute was present in the Access-Request.

2.3.  EAP-Peer-Id

   Description

      The EAP-Peer-Id Attribute contains a Peer-Id generated by the EAP
      method.  Exactly how this name is used depends on the link layer
      in question.  See [KEYFRAME] for more discussion.  The EAP-Peer-Id
      Attribute MAY be included in Access-Request, Access-Accept and
      Accounting-Request packets.  More than one EAP-Peer-Id Attribute
      MUST NOT be included in an Access-Request; one or more EAP-Peer-Id
      attributes MAY be included in an Access-Accept.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name, and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  Since the
      NAS operates as a pass-through in EAP [RFC3748], it cannot know
      the EAP-Peer-Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As a
      result, an EAP-Peer-Id Attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST
      NOT contain any data.  A home RADIUS server receiving an Access-
      Request an EAP-Peer-Id Attribute with non-empty data MUST silently
      discard the Attribute.  In addition, the home RADIUS server SHOULD
      include one or more EAP-Peer-Id attributes in an Access-Accept

      only if an empty EAP-Peer-Id Attribute was present in the Access-
      Request.  A summary of the EAP-Peer-Id Attribute format is shown
      below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code

      TBD

   Length

      >=2

   String

      The String field, when present, is one or more octets containing a
      EAP Peer-Id exported by the EAP method.  For details, see
      [KEYFRAME] Appendix A.  A robust implementation SHOULD support the
      field as undistinguished octets.

2.4.  EAP-Server-Id

   Description

      The EAP-Server-Id Attribute contains a Server-Id generated by the
      EAP method.  Exactly how this name is used depends on the link
      layer in question.  See [KEYFRAME] for more discussion.  The EAP-
      Server-Id Attribute is only allowed in Access-Request, Access-
      Accept, and Accounting-Request packets.  More than one EAP-Server-
      Id Attribute MUST NOT be included in an Access-Request; one or
      more EAP-Server-Id attributes MAY be included in an Access-Accept.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name, and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  Since the
      NAS operates as a pass-through in EAP [RFC3748], it cannot know
      the EAP-Server-Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As
      a result, an EAP-Server-Id Attribute sent in an Access-Request
      MUST NOT contain any data.  A home RADIUS server receiving in an
      Access-Request an EAP-Server-Id Attribute with non-empty data MUST
      silently discard the Attribute.  In addition, the home RADIUS
      server SHOULD include this Attribute an Access-Accept only if an
      empty EAP-Server-Id Attribute was present in the Access-Request.
      A summary of the EAP-Server-Id Attribute format is shown below.

      field as undistinguished octets.

2.5.  Mobility-Domain-Id

   Description

      A single Mobility-Domain-Id Attribute MAY be included in an
      Access-Request or Accounting-Request, in order to enable the NAS
      to provide the RADIUS server with the Mobility Domain Identifier,
      defined in IEEE 802.11r [IEEE-802.11r].  A summary of the
      Mobility-Domain-Id Attribute format is shown below.  The fields
      are transmitted from left to right.

   String

      The String field contains one or more octets, encoding a single
      Mobility Domain Identifier as defined in IEEE 802.11r
      [IEEE-802.11r].  UTF-8 encoded 10646 characters are recommended,
      but a robust implementation SHOULD support the field as
      undistinguished octets.

2.6.  Preauth-Timeout

   Description

      This Attribute sets the maximum number of seconds which pre-
      authentication state is kept by the NAS.  This Attribute MAY be
      sent by the server to the NAS in an Access-Accept.  Where both
      Session-Timeout and Preauth-Timeout attributes are present in an
      Access-Accept, the Session-Timeout Attribute refers only to the
      maximum session time after the supplicant associates with the
      authenticator and is enabled to send data frames through it.  A
      summary of the Preauth-Timeout Attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

     0     This Attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
     0+    Zero or more instances of this Attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.
     0-1   Zero or one instance of this Attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   The EAP-Key-Name Attribute is already defined as a RADIUS Attribute
   within Diameter EAP [RFC4072].

   When used in Diameter, the other attributes defined in this
   specification can be used as Diameter AVPs from the Code space 1-255
   (RADIUS Attribute compatibility space).  No additional Diameter Code
   values are therefore allocated.  The data types and flag rules for
   the attributes are as follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT       RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802         30 July 2007


                                  +---------------------+
                                  |    AVP Flag rules   |
                                  |----+-----+----+-----|----+
                                  |    |     |SHLD| MUST|    |
   Attribute Name      Value Type |MUST| MAY | NOT|  NOT|Encr|

   EAP-Peer-Id         UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   EAP-Server-Id       UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |

   EAP-Lower-Layer     Unsigned32 | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   -------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|

   The attributes in this specification have no special translation
   requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways;
   they are copied as is, except for changes relating to headers,
   alignment, and padding. See also [RFC3588] Section 4.1 and [RFC4005]
   Section 9.

   What this specification says about the applicability of the
   attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in Diameter to
   AA-Request [RFC4005] or Diameter-EAP-Request [RFC4072].  What is said
   about Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer [RFC4005] or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer [RFC4072] with Result-Code AVP set to
   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH.

   What is said about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate success.  Similarly, what
   is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in Diameter to AA-
   Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate failure.

   What is said about COA-Request applies in Diameter to Re-Auth-Request
   [RFC4005].

   What is said about Accounting-Request applies to Diameter Accounting-
   Request [RFC4005] as well.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace, see
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types>.  This specification
   requires assignment of a RADIUS attribute types for the following
   attributes:






Aboba & Malinen             Proposed Standard                  [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT       RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802         30 July 2007


   Attribute                     Type
   =========                     ====
   Allowed-Called-Station-Id     TBD
   EAP-Peer-Id                   TBD
   EAP-Server-Id                 TBD
   Mobility-Domain-Id            TBD
   Preauth-Timeout               TBD
   EAP-Lower-Layer               TBD

   This specification allocates the following decimal values for the
   EAP-Lower-Layer Attribute:

   1 -  Wired IEEE 802.1X Version 1 (2001)
   2 -  Wired IEEE 802.1X Version 2 (2004)
   3 -  WPA
   4 -  WPA2 (no pre-authentication)
   5 -  WPA2, IEEE 802.1X pre-authentication
   6 -  IEEE 802.11r
   7 -  IEEE 802.11s
   8 -  IEEE 802.1af
   9 -  IEEE 802.16e
   10 - IKEv2
   11 - PPP
   12 - PANA (no pre-authentication)

   Additional values are allocated as described in [RFC3575] Section 2.1
   (Designated Expert).

6.  Security Considerations

   Since this document describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of
   authentication, authorization, and accounting in IEEE 802 networks,
   it is vulnerable to all of the threats that are present in other
   RADIUS applications.  For a discussion of these threats, see
   [RFC2607], [RFC2865], [RFC3162], [RFC3576], [RFC3579], and [RFC3580].
