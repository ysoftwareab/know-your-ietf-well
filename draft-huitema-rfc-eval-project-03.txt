             Evaluation of a Sample of RFC Produced in 2018
                   draft-huitema-rfc-eval-project-03

Abstract

   This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently
   published RFC.  We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in
   2018, looking for history and delays.  We also use two randomly
   chosen sets of RFC published in 2008 and 1998 for comparing delays
   seen in 2018 to those observed 10 or 20 years ago.
   The average RFC in the 2018 sample was produced in 3 years and 4
   months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in the working
   group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4
   months in RFC production.  The main variation in RFC production
   delays comes from the AUTH-48 phase.

   We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using
   Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about
   deployment.  We show that citation counts indicate academic interest,
   but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the
   specifications.

   The RFCs selected for this survey were chosen at random and represent
   a small sample of all RFCs produced, and only approximately 10% of
   the RFCs produced in each of 1998, 2008, and 2018.  It is possible
   that different samples would produce different results.  Furthermore,
   the conclusions drawn from the observations made in this document
   represent the author's opinions and do not have consensus of the
   IETF.

1.  Introduction

   As stated on the organization's web site, "The IETF is a large open
   international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and
   researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture
   and the smooth operation of the Internet."  In this memo, the author
   attempts to evaluate the RFC production process.  This is an
   individual effort, and the author's conclusions presented here did
   not reach any kind of IETF consensus.

   The IETF keeps records of documents and process actions in the IETF
   data tracker [TRKR].  The IETF data tracker provides information
   about RFC and drafts, from which we can infer statistics about the
   production system.  We can measure how long it takes to drive a
   proposition from initial draft to final publication, and how these
   delays can be split between Working Group discussions, IETF reviews,
   IESG assessment, RFC Editor delays and final reviews by the authors.

   Just measuring production delays may be misleading.  If the IETF
   simply rubber-stamped draft proposals and published them, the delays
   would be short but the quality and impact might suffer.  We hope that
   most of the RFC that are published are useful, but we need a way to
   measure that usefulness.  We try to do that by measuring the number
   of references of the published RFCs in Semantic Scholar [SSCH], and
   also by asking the authors of each RFC in the sample whether the
   protocols and technologies defined in the RFCs were implemented and
   used on the Internet.

   In order to limit the resource required for this study, we selected
   at random 20 RFC published in 2018, as explained in Section 2.2.  For
   comparison purposes, we also selected at random 20 RFC published in
   1998 and 20 published in 2008.  Limiting the sample to 20 out of 209
   RFCs published in 2018 allows for in depth analysis of each RFC, but

   readers should be reminded that the samll sample size limits the
   statistical significance of the results.

   The information gathered for every RFC in the sample is presented in
   Section 3.  In Section 4 we analyze the production process and the
   sources of delays, comparing the 2018 sample to the selected samples
   for 1998 and 2018.  In Section 5.1 we present citation counts for the
   RFC in the samples, and analyze whether citation counts could be used
   to evaluate the quality of RFC.

   The measurement of delays could be automated by processing dates and
   events recorded in the data tracker.  The measurement of published
   RFC could be complemented by statistics on abandoned drafts, which
   would measure the efficiency of the IETF triaging process.  These
   potential next steps are developed in Section 6.

2.  Methodology

   The study reported here started with a simple idea: take a sample of
   RFC, and perform an in-depth analysis of the path from the first
   presentation of the idea to its publication, while also trying to
   access the success of the resulting specification.  This requires
   defining the key milestones that we want to track, and drawing a
   random sample using an unbiased process.

2.1.  Defining the Important Milestones

   The IETF data tracker records a list of events for each document
   processed by IETF working groups.  This has a high granularity, and
   also a high variability.  Most documents start life as an individual
   draft, are adopted by a working group, undergo a working group last
   call, are submitted to the IESG, undergo an IETF last call and an
   IESG review, get eventually approved by the IESG, and are processed
   for publication by the RFC Editor, but there are exceptions.  Some
   documents are first submitted to one working group and then moved to
   another.  Some documents are published through the Independent
   Stream, and are submitted to the Independent Stream Editor instead of
   the IESG.

   In order to simplify tabulation, we break the delay from between the
   submission of the first draft and the publication of the RFC in three
   big components:

   o  The working group delay, from the first draft to the start of the
      IETF last call;






Huitema                  Expires August 10, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                RFC-Eval-2018                February 2020


   o  The IETF delay, which lasts from the beginning of the IETF last
      call to the approval by the IESG, including the reviews by various
      directorates;

   o  The RFC production, from approval by the IESG to publication,
      including the AUTH-48 reviews.

   For submissions to the independent stream, we don't have a working
   group.  We consider instead the progression of the individual draft
   until the adoption by the ISE as the equivalent of the "working
   group" period, and the delay from adoption by the ISE until
   submission to the RFC Editor as the equivalent of the IETF delay.

   We measure the staring point of the process using the date of
   submission of the first draft listed on that RFC page in the IETF
   data tracker.  In most case, this first draft is an individual draft
   that then resubmitted as a working group draft, or maybe resubmitted
   with a new name as the draft was searching for a home in an IETF
   working group, or before deciding for submission on the independent
   stream.

   The IETF Data Tracker entries for RFC and drafts do not list working
   group events like Working Group Last Call.  The only intermediate
   event that we list between the first draft and the submission to the
   IESG is the Working Group Adoption.  For that, we use the date of
   submission of the version 00 of the draft eventually published as
   RFC.  We use the same definition for drafts submitted to the
   Independent Stream.

2.2.  Selecting a Random Sample of RFC

   Basic production mechanisms could be evaluated by processing data
   from the IETF data tracker, but subjective data requires manual
   assessment of results, which can be time consuming.  Since our
   resources are limited, we will only perform this analysis for a small
   sample of RFC, selected at random from the list of RFC approved in
   2018.  Specifically, we will pick 20 RFC at random between:

   o  RFC 8307, published in January 2018, and

   o  RFC 8511, published December 2018.

   In order to avoid injecting personal bias in the random selection, we
   use a random selection process similar to the Nomination Committee
   selection process defined in [RFC3797].  The process is seeded with
   the text string "vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas", and the results
   are:

   When evaluating delays and impact, we will compare the year 2018 to
   2008 and 1998, 10 and 20 years ago.  To drive this comparison, we
   pick 20 RFC at random among those published in 2008, and another 20
   among those published in 1998.  We use the same nomcom-like
   methodology.

   For 2008, we picking random RFC numbers between RFC 5134 (January
   2008) and RFC 5405 (December 2008), using the sentence "sed fugit
   interea fugit irreparabile tempus" as a seed.  We actually list here
   21 numbers, because the random draw place RFC 5315 in 20th position,
   but that RFC was never issued.  We replace it by RFC 5301, which came
   in 21st position.

3.  Analysis of 20 Selected RFC

   We review each of the RFC listed in Section 2.2 for the year 2018,
   trying both to answer the known questions and to gather insight for
   further analyzes.  In many cases, the analysis of the data is
   complemented by direct feedback from the RFC authors.

   The draft underwent minor copy edit before publication.

   Some but not all of the long delay in AUTH-48 is due to clustering
   with [RFC8410].  MISSREF was cleared on 2018-05-09 and the document
   re-entered AUTH-48 at once.  AUTH-48 lasted over two months after
   that.

   The time after AUTH-48 and before publication (3 weeks) partly
   overlaps with travel for IETF-102 and is partly due to coordinating
   the cluster.

3.2.  8456

   Benchmarking Methodology for Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

   The draft underwent very extensive copy editing, covering use of
   articles, turn of phrases, choice of vocabulary.  The changes are
   enough to cause pagination differences.  The "diff" tool marks pretty
   much every page as changed.  Some diagrams see change in protocol
   elements like message names.

   According to the author, the experience of producing this draft
   mirrors a typical one in the Benchmarking Methodologies Working Group
   (BMWG).  There were multiple authors in multiple time zones, which
   slowed down the AUTH-48 process somewhat, although the AUTH-48 delay
   of 46 days is only a bit longer than the average draft.

   The RFC was part of cluster with [RFC8455].

   BMWG publishes informational RFCs centered around benchmarking, and
   the methodologies in RFC 8456 have been implemented in benchmarking
   products.

3.3.  8446

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3 [RFC8446], as
   the title indicates, defines the new version of the TLS protocol.
   From the IETF data tracker, we extract the following:

   Proposed standard
   160 pages
   29 WG drafts first 2014-04-17.
   Last call announced 2018-02-15

   AUTH-48 2018-06-14
   AUTH-48 complete 2018-08-10
   Published 2018-08-10

   This draft started as a WG effort.

   The RFC was a major effort in the IETF.  Working group members
   developed and tested several implementations.  Researchers analyzed
   the specifications and performed formal verifications.  Deployment
   tests outlined issues that caused extra work when the specification
   was almost ready.  These complexity largely explains the time spent
   in the working group.

   Comparing the final draft to the published version, we find
   relatively light copy editing.  It includes explaining acronyms on
   first use, clarifying some definitions standardizing punctiation and
   capitalization, and spelling out some numbers in text.  This
   generally fall in the category of "style", although some of the
   clarifications go into message definitions.  However, that simple
   analysis does not explain why the AUTH-48 phase took almost two
   months.

   This document's AUTH-48 process was part of the "Github experiment",
   which tried to use github pull requests to track the AUTH-48 changes
   and review comments.  The RPC staff had to learn using Github for
   that process, and this required more work than the usual RFC.  Author
   and AD thoroughly reviewed each proposed edit, accepting some and
   rejecting some.  The concern there was that any change in a complex
   specification might affect a protocol that was extensively reviewed
   in the working group, but of course these reviews added time to the
   AUTH-48 delays.

   There are 21 implementations listed in the Wiki of the TLS 1.3
   project [TLS13IMP].  It has been deployed on major browsers, and is
   already used in a large fraction of TLS connections.

3.4.  8355

   Resiliency Use Cases in Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING)
   Networks [RFC8355] is an informational RFC.  It originated from a use
   case informational draft that was mostly used for the BOF creating
   the WG, and then to drive initial work/evolutions from the WG.

   No implementation of the RFC itself, but the technology behind it
   such as Segment Routing (architecture RFC 8402, TI-LFA draft-ietf-
   rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa) is widely implemented and deployment is
   ongoing.

   According to participants in the discussion, the process of adoption
   of the source packet routing standards was very contentious.  The
   establishment of consensus at both the working group level and the
   IETF level was difficult and time consuming.

   This RFC defines the support of WebSockets in HTTP/2, which is
   different from the mechanism defined for HTTP/1.1 in [RFC6455].  The
   process was relatively straightforward, involving the usual type of
   discussions, some on details and some on important points.

   Comparing final draft and published RFC shows a minor set of copy
   edit, mostly for style.  However, the author recalls a painful
   process.  The RFC includes many charts and graphs that were very
   difficult to format correctly in the author's production process that
   involve conversions from markdown to XML, and then from XML to text.
   The author had to get substantial help from the RFC editor.

   There are several implementations, including Firefox and Chrome,
   making RFC 8441 a very successful specification.

   DNS Privacy, Authorization, Special Uses, Encoding, Characters,
   Matching, and Root Structure: Time for Another Look?  [RFC8324].

   Published 2018-02-27

   This RFC took only 9 months from first draft to publication, which is
   the shortest in the 2018 sample set.  In part, this is because the
   text was privately circulated and reviewed by ISE designated experts
   before the first draft was published.  The nature of the document is
   another reason for the short delay.  It is an opinion piece, and does
   not require the same type of consensus building and reviews than a
   protocol specification.

   Comparing the final draft and the published version shows only minor
   copy edit, mostly for style.  According to the author, because this
   is because he knows how to write in RFC Style with the result that
   his documents often need a minimum of editing.  He also makes sure
   that the document on which the Production Center starts working
   already has changes discussed and approved during Last Call and IESG
   review incorporated rather than expecting the Production Center to
   operate off of notes about changed to be made.

   This RFC recommends to deprecate two encryption algorithms that are
   now considered obsolete and possibly broken.  The document was sent
   back to the WG after the first last call, edited, and then there was
   a second last call.  The delay from first draft to working group last
   call was relatively short, but the number may be misleading.  The
   initial draft was a replacement of a similar draft in the KITTEN
   working group, which stagnated for some time before the CURDLE
   working group took up the work.  The deprecation of RC4 was somewhat
   contentious, but the WG had already debated this prior to the
   production of this draft, and the draft was not delayed by this
   debate.

   Most of the 280 days between IETF LC and IESG approval was because
   the IESG had to talk about whether this document should obsolete or
   move to historic RFC 4757, and no one was really actively pushing
   that discussion for a while.

   The 99 days in AUTH-48 are mostly because one of the authors was a
   sitting AD, and those duties ended up taking precedence over
   reviewing this document.

   Minor copy editing, for style.

   The implementation of the draft would be the actual removal of
   support for 3DES and RC4 in major implementations.  This is
   happening, but very slowly.

   OSes after that.  After some debates from 2015 to 2015, the TCPM
   working group adopted the draft, with a goal of documenting Cubic in

   the RFc series.  According to the authors, this was not a high
   priority effort, as Cubic was already implemented in multiple OSes
   and documented in research papers.  At some point, only one of the
   authors was actively working on the draft.  Ths may explain why
   another two years was spent progressing the draft after adoption by
   the WG.

   The RFC publication may or may not have triggered further
   implementations.  On the other hand, several OSes picked up bug fixes
   from the draft and the RFC.

   This RFC has a complex history.  The first individual draft was
   submitted to the TLS working group on September 7, 2012.  It
   progressed there, and was adopted by the WG after 3 revisions.  There
   were then 8 revisions in the TLS WG, until the WG decided to not
   progress it.  The draft was parked in 2013 by the WG chairs after
   failing to get consensus in WG last call.  The AD finally pulled the
   plug in 2016, and the draft was then resubmitted to the ISE.

   At that point, the author was busy and was treating this RFC with a
   low priority because, in his words, it would not be a "real RFC".
   There were problems with the draft that only came up late.  In
   particular, it had to wait for a change in registry policy that only
   came about with the publication of TLS 1.3, which caused the draft to
   only be published after RFC 8446, and also required adding references
   to TLS 1.3.  The author also got a very late comment while in AUTH-48
   that caused some rewrite.  Finally, there was some IANA issue with
   the extension registry where a similar extension was added by someone
   else.  The draft was changed to just use it.

   This is a pretty simple document, but it took over 3 years from
   individual draft to RFC.  According to the authors,the biggest
   setbacks occurred at the start: it took a while to find a home for
   this draft.  It was presented in the TLS WG (because it's a TLS
   extension) and UTA WG (because it has to do with applications using
   TLS).  Then the ADs determined that a new WG was needed, so the
   authors had to work through the WG creation process, including

   TLS 1.3.

   Perhaps partially due to the delays, some of the implementers lost
   interest in supporting this RFC.

3.18.  8362

   OSPFv3 Link State Advertisement (LSA) Extensibility [RFC8362] is a
   major extension to the OSPF protocol.  It makes OSPFv3 fully
   extensible.

   The specification was first submitted as a personal draft in the IPv6
   WG, then moved to the OSPF WG.  The long delay of producing this RFC
   is due to the complexity of the problem, and the need to wait for
   implementations.  It is a very important change to OSPF that makes
   OSPFv3 fully extensible.  Since it was a non-backward compatible
   change, the developers started out with some very complex migration
   scenarios but ended up with either legacy or extended OSPFv3 LSAs
   within an OSPFv3 routing domain.  The initial attempts to have a
   hybrid mode of operation with both legacy and extended LSAs also
   delayed implementation due to the complexity.

   Copy editing for style and clarity.

   This specification either was or will be implemented by all the
   router vendors.

3.19.  8468

   IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence: Updates for the IP Performance
   Metrics (IPPM) Framework [rfc8468].

   Informational, 15 pages.
   3 personal drafts, first 2015-08-06. 7 WG drafts
   WG adoption on 2016-07-04
   Last call announced 2018-04-11, draft 04

   RFC8468 was somehow special in that there was not a technical reason/
   interest that triggered it, but rather a formal requirement.  While
   writing RFC7312 the IP Performance Metrics working group (IPPM)
   realized that RFC 2330, the IP Performance Metrics Framework
   supported IPv4 only and explicitly excluded support for IPv6.
   Nevertheless, people used the metrics that were defined on top of RFC
   2330 (and, therefore, IPv4 only) for IPv6, too.  Although the IPPM WG
   agreed that the work was needed, the interest of IPPM attendees in
   progressing (and reading/reviewing) the IPv6 draft was limited.
   Resolving the IPv6 technical part was straight-forward, but
   subsequently some people asked for a broader scope (topics like
   header compression, 6lo, etc.) and it took some time to figure out
   and later on convince people that these topics are out of scope.  The
   group also had to resolve contentious topics, for example how to
   measure the processing of IPv6 extension headers, which is sometimes
   non-standard.

   The AUTH-48 delay for this draft was longer than average.  According
   to the authors, the main reasons include:

   o  Work-load and travel caused by busy-work-periods of all co-authors

   o  Time zone difference between co-authors and editor (at least US,
      Europe, India, not considering travel)

   o  Editor proposing and committing some unacceptable modifications
      that needed to be reverted

   o  Lengthy discussions on a new document title (required high effort
      and took a long time, in particular reaching consensus between co-
      authors and editor was time-consuming and involved the AD)

   o  Editor correctly identifying some nits (obsoleted personal
      websites of co-authors) and co-authors attempting to fix them.

   The differences between the final draft and the publish RFC show copy
   editing for style and clarity, but do not account for the back and
   forth between authors and editors mentioned by the authors.

4.  Analysis of Process and Delays

   We examine the 20 RFC in the sample, measuring various
   characteristics such as delay and citation counts, in an attempt to
   identify patterns in the IETF processes.

4.1.  First Draft to RFC Delays

   We look at the distribution of delays between the submission of the
   first draft and the publication of the RFC, using the three big
   milestones defined in Section 2.1: delay in the Working Group, IETF
   delay, and publication delay.  The following table shows the delays
   for the 20 RFC in the sample:

   stream submissions, the average delay from start to finish is 3 years
   and 3 months, of which on average 2 years and 9 months are spent
   getting consensus in the working group, and 3 to 4 months each for
   IETF consensus and for RFC production.

   The longest delay is found for [RFC8492], 6.5 years from start to
   finish.  This is however a very special case, a draft that was
   prepared for the TLS working group and failed to reach consensus.
   After that, it was resubmitted to the ISE, and incurred atypical
   production delays.

   On average, we see that 80% of the delay is incurred in WG
   processing, 10% in IETF review, and 10% for edition and publication.
   We can compare these delays to those observed 10 years ago and 20
   years ago:

   The IETF takes three to four times more times to produce an RFC in
   2018 than it did in 1998, but about the same time as it did in 2008.
   We can get a rough estimate of how this translates in term of "level
   of attention" per RFC by comparing the number of participants in the
   IETF meetings of 2018, 2008 and 1998 [IETFCOUNT] to the number of RFC
   published these years [RFCYEAR].

   +------+------+---------+---------+------+----------+---------------+
   | Year |   Nb |  Spring |  Summer | Fall |  Average | Attendees/RFC |
   |      |  RFC |      P. |      P. |      |       P. |               |
   +------+------+---------+---------+------+----------+---------------+
   | 2018 |  208 |    1235 |    1078 |  879 |     1064 | 5.1           |
   |      |      |         |         |      |          |               |
   | 2008 |  290 |    1128 |    1181 |  962 |     1090 | 3.8           |
   |      |      |         |         |      |          |               |
   | 1998 |  234 |    1775 |    2106 | 1705 |     1862 | 9.0           |
   +------+------+---------+---------+------+----------+---------------+

   The last column in the table provides the ratio of average number of
   participants by number of RFC produced.  If the IETF was a
   centralized organization, if all participants and documents were
   equivalent, this ratio would be the number of participants dedicated
   to produce an RFC on a given year.  This is of course a completely
   abstract figure because none of the hypotheses above is true, but it
   still gives a vague indication of the "level of attention" applied to
   documents.  We see that this ratio has increased from 2008 to 2018,
   as the number of participants was about the same for these two years
   but the number of published RFC decreased.  However, that ratio was
   much higher in 1998.  The IETF had many more participants, and there
   were probably many more eyes available to review any given draft.  If
   we applied the ratios of 1998, the IETF would be producing 119
   documents in 2018 instead of 208.

4.2.  Working Group Delays

   The largest part of the delays is spent in the working groups, before
   the draft is submitted to the IESG for IETF review.  As mentioned in
   Section 2.1, the only intermediate milestone that we can extract from

   The delay before working group adoption average to a bit less than 10
   months, compared to 1 years and a bit more than 9 months for delays
   after adoption.  We see that RFC 8492 stands out, with long delays
   spent attempting publication through a working group before
   submission to the independent editor.  There are a few documents that
   started immediately as working group efforts, or were immediately
   targeted for publication in the independent series.  Those documents
   tend to see short delays, with the exception of RFC 8446 on which the
   TLS working groupspent a long time working.

4.3.  Preparation and Publication Delays

   The preparation and publication delays include three components:

   o  the delay from submission to the RFC Editor to beginning of AUTH-
      48, during which the document is prepared;

   o  the AUTH-48 delay, during which authors review and eventually
      approve the changes proposed by the editors;

   o  the publication delay, from final agreement by authors and editors
      to actual publication.

   The breakdown of the publication delays for each RFC is shown in the
   following table.

   On average, the total delay appears to be a bit more than four month,
   but the average is skewed by the extreme values encountered for
   [RFC8492].  If we exclude that RFC from the computations, the average
   delay drops to a just a bit more than 3 months: about 2 months for
   the preparation, a bit more than one month for the AUTH-48 phase, and
   4 days for the publishing.

   Of course, these delays vary from RFC to RFC.  To try explain the
   causes of the delay, we compute the correlation factor between the
   observed delays and 4 plausible explanation factors:

   o  The number of pages in the document,

   o  The amount of copy edit, as discussed in Section 4.4,

   o  Whether or not an IANA action was required.

   We find the following values:

            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+
            | Correlation | RFC edit | AUTH-48 | Edit(total) |
            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+
            | Nb pages    |     0.50 |   -0.04 |        0.21 |
            |             |          |         |             |
            | Copy-Edit   |     0.42 |    0.24 |        0.45 |
            |             |          |         |             |
            | IANA        |    -0.13 |    0.26 |        0.15 |
            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+

   None of these indicate strong correlations.  The greater number of
   pages will tend to increase the preparation delay, but it does not
   appear to impact the AUTH-48 delay at all.  The amount of copy
   editing also tend to increase the the preparation delay somewhat and
   the AUTH-48 delay a little.  The presence or absence of IANA action
   has very ittle correlation with the delays.

   We also observe that the AUTH-48 delay varies much more than the
   preparation delay, with a standard deviation of 20 days for AUTH-48
   versus 10 days for the preparation delay.  In theory, AUTH-48 is just
   a final verification: the authors receive the document prepared by
   the RFC production center, and just have to give their approval, or
   maybe request a last minute correction.  The name indicates that this
   is expected to last just two days, but in average it lasts more than
   a month.

   We tested a variety of hypotheses that might explain the duration of
   AUTH-48 by computing the correlation coefficients between various

   properties of the RFC and the production delays.  The results are
   listed in the following table:

       +-------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+
       | Correlation | RFC production | AUTH-48 | RFC Edit(total) |
       +-------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+
       | Nb drafts   |           0.19 |   -0.30 |           -0.17 |
       |             |                |         |                 |
       | Nb Authors  |           0.40 |   -0.04 |            0.16 |
       |             |                |         |                 |
       | WG delay    |           0.03 |   -0.16 |           -0.15 |
       +-------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+

   The results show that there is no simple answer.  The number of
   pages, the required amount of copy editing and to a very small extent
   the number of drafts can help predict the production delay, but there
   is no obvious predictor for the AUTH-48 delay.  In particular, there
   is no numerical evidence that the number of authors influences the
   AUTH-48 delay, or that authors who have spent a long time working on
   the document in the working group somehow spend even longer to answer
   questions during AUTH-48 - if anything, the numerical results point
   in the opposite direction.

   After asking the authors of the RFC in the sample why the AUTH-48
   phase took a long time, and we got three explanations:

   1- Some RFC have multiple authors in multiple time zones.  This slows
   down the coordination required for approving changes.

   2- Some authors found some of the proposed changes unnecessary or
   undesirable, and asked that they be reversed.  This required long
   exchanges between authors and editors.

   3- Some authors were not giving high priority to AUTH-48 responses.

   As mentioned above, we were not able to verify these hypotheses by
   looking at the data.

4.4.  Copy Editing

   We can assess the amount of copy editing applied to each published
   RFC by comparing the text of the draft approved for publication and
   the text of the RFC.  We do expect differences in the "boilerplate"
   and in the IANA section, but we will also see differences due to copy
   editing.  Assessing the amount of copy editing is subjective, and we
   do it using a scale of 1 to 4:

   1- Minor editing

   2- Editing for style, such as capitalization, hyphens, that versus
   which, and expending all acronyms at least one.

   3- Editing for clarity in addition to style, such as rewriting
   ambiguous sentences and clarifying use of internal references.  For
   Yang models, that may include model corrections suggested by the
   verifier.

   4- Extensive editing.

   The following table shows that with about half of the RFC required
   editing for style, and the other half at least some editing for
   clarity.

   This method of assessment does not take into account the number of
   changes proposed by the editors and eventually rejected by the
   authors, since these changes are not present in either the final
   draft or the published RFC.  It might be possible to get an
   evaluation of these "phantom changes" from the RFC Production Center.

4.5.  Independent Series

   Out of 20 randomly selected RFC, 3 were published through the
   "independent series".  One is an independent opinion, another a
   description of a non-IETF protocol format, and the third was
   [RFC8492], which is a special case.  Apart from this special case,
   the publication delays were significantly shorter for the Independent
   Stream than for the IETF stream.  This seems to indicate that the
   Independent Series is functioning as expected.

   The authors of these 3 RFC are regular IETF contributors.  This
   observation motivated a secondary analysis of all the RFC published
   in the "independent" stream in 2018.  There are 14 such RFC: 8507,
   8494, 8493, 8492, 8483, 8479, 8433, 8409, 8374, 8369, 8367, 8351,
   8328 and 8324.  (RFC 8367 and 8369 were published on 1 April 2018.)
   The majority of the documents were published by regular IETF
   participants, but two of them were not.  One describes "The BagIt
   File Packaging Format (V1.0)" [RFC8493], and the other the "Yeti DNS
   Testbed" [RFC8483].  They document a data format and a system
   developed outside the IETF, and illustrate the outreach function of
   the Independent Stream.  In both cases, the authors include one
   experienced IETF participant, who presumably helped outsiders
   navigate the publication process.

5.  Citation Counts

   In this exploration, we want to assess whether citation counts
   provide a meaningful assessment of the popularity of RFC.  We obtain
   the citation counts through the Semantic Scholar API, using queries
   of the form:

   http://api.semanticscholar.org/
        v1/paper/10.17487/rfc8446?include_unknown_references=true

   In these queries, the RFC is uniquely identified by its DOI
   reference, which is composed of the RFC Series prefix 10.17487 and
   the rfc identifier.  The queries return a series of properties,
   including a list of citations for the RFC.  Based on that list of
   citations, we compute three numbers:

   o  The total number of citations

   o  The number of citations in the year of publication and the year
      after that

   o  For the RFC published in 1998 or 2008 that we use for comparison,
      the number of citations in the years 2018 and 2019.

   The results indicate that [RFC8446] is by far the most cited of the
   20 RFC in our sample.  This is not surprising, since TLS is a key
   Internet Protocol.  The TLS 1.3 protocol was also the subject of
   extensive studies by researchers, and thus was mentioned in a number
   of published papers.  Surprisingly, the Semantic Scholar mentions a
   number of citations that predate the publication date.  These are
   probably citations of the various draft versions of the protocol.

   The next most cited RFC in the sample is [RFC8312] which describes
   the Cubic congestion control algorithm for TCP.  That protocol was
   also the target of a large number of academic publications.The other
   RFC in the sample only have a small number of citations.

   There is probably a small bias when measuring citations at a fixed
   date.  An RFC published in January 2018 would have more time to
   accrue citations than one published in December.  That may be true to
   some extent, as the second most cited RFC in the set was published in
   January.  However, the effect has to be limited.  The most cited RFC
   was published in August, and the second most cited was published in
   2019.  (That RFC got an RFC number in 2018, but publication was
   slowed by long AUTH-48 delays.)

5.2.  Comparison to 1998 and 2008

   In order to get a baseline, we can look at the number of references
   for the RFC published in 2008 and 1998.  However, we need totake time
   into account.  Documents published a long time ago are expected to
   have accrued more references.  We try to address this by looking at
   three counts for each document: the overall number of references over
   the document's lifetime, the number of references obtained in the
   year following publication, and the number of references observed
   since 2018:

   The total numbers shows new documents with fewer citations than the
   older ones.  This can be explained to some degree by the passage of
   time.  If we restrict the analysis to the number of citations accrued
   in the year of publishing and the year after that, we still see about
   the same distribution for the three samples.

   We also see that the number of references to RFC fades over time.
   Only the most popular of the RFC produced in 1998 are still cited in
   2019.

   From looking at these results, it is fairly obvious that citation
   counts cannot be used as proxies for the "value" of an RFC.  In our
   sample, the two RFC that have high citation counts were both widely
   deployed, and can certainly be described as successful, but we also
   see many RFC that saw significant deployment without garnering a high
   level of citations.

   Citation counts are driven by academic interest, but are only loosely
   correlated with actual deployment.  We saw that [RFC8446] was widely
   cited in part because the standardization process involved many
   researchers, and that the high citation count of [RFC8312] is largely
   due to the academic interest in evaluating congestion control
   protocols.  If we look at previous years, the most cited RFC in the
   2008 sample is [RFC5326], an experimental RFC defining security
   extensions to an experimental delay tolerant transport protocol.
   This protocol does not carry a significant proportion of Internet
   traffic, but has been the object of a fair number of academic
   studies.

   The citation process tends to privilege the first expression of a
   concept.  We see that with the most cited RFC in the 1998 set is
   [RFC2267], an informational RFC defining Network Ingress Filtering
   that was obsoleted in May 2000 by [RFC2827].  It is still cited
   frequently in 2018 and 2019, regardless of its formal status in the
   RFC series.  We see the same effect at work with [RFC8441], which
   garners very few citations although it obsoletes [RFC6455] that has a
   large number of citations.  The same goes for [RFC8468], which is
   sparsely cited while the [RFC2330] is widely cited.  Just counting
   citations will not indicate whether developers still use an old
   specification or have adopted the revised RFC.

6.  Observations and Next Steps

   The goal of this study was to evaluate how the IETF produces
   standards, from working group processing to RFC production.  As shown
   in Section 4, the average RFC was produced in 3 years and 4 months,
   which is similar to what was found in the 2008 sample, but more than
   three times larger than the delays for the 1998 sample.

   The Working group process appears to be the main source of delays.
   Efforts to diminish delays should probably focus there, instead of on
   the IETF and IESG reviews of the RFC production.  For the RFC
   production phase, most of the variability originates in the AUTH-48
   process, which is influenced by a variety of factors such as number
   of authors or level of engagement of these authors.

   Most of the delay is spent in the working group, but the IETF data
   tracker does not hold much information about what happens inside the
   working groups.  For example, events like Working Group Last Calls
   are not recorded in the history of the drafts available in the
   datatracker.  Such information would have been interesting.  Of
   course, requiring that information would create an administrative
   burden, so there is clearly a trade-off between requiring more work
   from working group chairs and providing better data for process
   analysis.

   The Independent Submission stream operates as expected.  The majority
   of the authors of the independent RFC appear to be in IETF insiders,
   but there is some amount of engagement by outside parties.

   The analysis of citations in Section 5.1 shows that citation numbers
   are a very poor indication of the "value" of an RFC.  Citation
   numbers measure the engagement of academic researchers with specific
   topics, but have little correlation with the level of adoption and
   deployment of a specific RFC.

   This document analyses a small sample of RFC "in depth".  This
   allowed gathering of detailed feedback on the process and the
   deployments.  On the other hand, much of the data on delays is
   available from the IETF data tracker.  It may be worth considering
   adding an automated reporting of delay metrics in the IETF data
   tracker.

   This document only considers the RFC that were published in a given
   year.  This approach can be criticized as introducing a form of
   "survivor bias".  There are many drafts proposed to the IETF, and
   only a fraction of them end up being published as RFC.  On one hand
   this is expected, because part of the process is to triage between
   ideas that can gather consensus and those that don't.  On the other
   hand, we don't know whether that triage is too drastic and
   discouraged progress on good ideas.

   One way to evaluate the triage process would be to look at
   publication attempts that were abandoned, for example drafts that
   expired without progressing or being replaced.  The sampling
   methodology could also be used for that purpose.  Pick maybe 20
   drafts at random, among those abandoned in a target year, and
   investigate why they were abandoned.  Was it because better solutions
   emerged in the working group?  Or maybe because the authors
   discovered a flaw in their proposal?  Or was it because some
   factional struggle blocked a good idea?  Was the idea pursued in a
   different venue?  Hopefully, someone will try this kind of
   investigation.

7.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not specify any protocol.

   We might want to analyze whether security issues were discovered
   after publication of specific standards.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.

   Peliminary analysis does not indicate that IANA is causing any
   particular delay in the RFC publication process.
