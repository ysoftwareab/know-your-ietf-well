1.  Introduction

   The Synthetic Initialization Vector (SIV) block cipher mode of
   operation [RFC5297] provides either deterministic authenticated
   encryption (DAE) or nonce-reuse misuse-resistant authenticated
   encryption (MRAE) [DAE].  It was originally specified for the
   combination of AES-CMAC for authenticity and AES-CTR for
   confidentiality.  The 128-bit AES-CMAC tag is used as the 128-bit
   (synthetic) IV for AES-CTR.  This document show how to apply SIV mode
   to ciphers and MACs with IV and tag lengths other than 128 bits,
   including where the IV and tag length may differ.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

1.2.  Motivation

   Common IV-based authenticated encryption modes of operation require a
   unique IV (or nonce) to be provided on each call to the encryption
   function with the same key.  If an IV is reused, either by accident
   or through malicious action, then some combination of the
   confidentiality and/or authenticity properties is usually lost.  For

   the popular Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [SP800-38D], NIST states that
   "a breach of the requirement [...] for the uniqueness of the
   initialization strings may compromise the security assurance almost
   entirely" (section 3 and Appendix A).  The SIV mode of operation
   [RFC5297][SIV], when used with a unique nonce as part of the
   associated data, provides a measure of protection against nonce
   reuse.  If a nonce is reused with SIV mode then there is no loss of
   authenticity, and a minimal loss of confidentiality: an attacker is
   able to determine only whether the exact same message has been
   encrypted with the same associated data and nonce using the same key.

   While the SIV mode is specified as a generic composition of an IV-
   based encryption scheme and a pseudorandom function (PRF), most uses
   of the mode have concentrated on the one concrete instantiation of
   the mode given at the time: AES-SIV.  AES-SIV is built entirely from
   the AES block cipher, using AES-CMAC [RFC4493] as the PRF and AES in
   CTR mode for confidentiality.  This combination is attractive as it
   requires only an AES encryption operation to implement all aspects of
   the mode.  It also has the convenient property that AES-CMAC produces
   a 128-bit tag, and AES-CTR requires a 128-bit IV, which allows the
   tag to be used directly as the (synthetic) IV.

   While AES-SIV has many attractive properties, there are good reasons
   for extending SIV to other ciphers and PRFs.  As stated in the
   rationale for adopting ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for IETF protocols
   [RFC8439], overreliance on a single cipher design, however good, may
   cause difficulties if a weakness is ever discovered in AES.
   Secondly, AES can be difficult to implement efficiently in software
   while avoiding timing side-channels.  Finally, there is the simple
   fact that non-AES ciphers and PRFs exist and will continue to be
   used, and SIV mode is of independent interest to users of those
   alternative primitives.

2.  The Generic SIV Construction

   The generic SIV construction is defined in terms two primitive
   functions:

   1.  A PRF, F*, that takes a vector of strings as input.

   2.  A length-preserving IV-based encryption scheme, E.

   The S2V function can be used to build F* from a PRF, F, that takes a
   single string input.  The generalised version of this function is
   described in the next section.

   The following constants MUST be defined for any concrete
   instantiation of E and F*:

      IV_LEN - the length of IV/nonce expected by E, in bits.

      TAG_LEN - the length of the output tag produced by F*, in bits.

      PRF_KEY_LEN - the length of key required for F*, in bits.

      CIPHER_KEY_LEN - the length of key required for E, in bits.

   For any choice of E and F*, TAG_LEN MUST be greater than or equal to
   IV_LEN.

   We denote the encryption operation of E as E.encrypt(key, iv,
   plaintext), and the decryption operation as E.decrypt(key, iv,
   ciphertext).

2.1.  Encryption

   Encryption takes as input a key, K, a plaintext P, and zero or more
   associated data headers to be authenticated but not encrypted.  The
   key K MUST be as long as the sum of the key length of F* and the key
   length of E.  For example, if F* requires a 256-bit key and E
   requires a 128-bit key, then K must be 384 bits long.

   Encryption proceeds as follows.  Firstly, keys K1 and K2 are derived
   from K by taking the leftmost PRF_KEY_LEN bits of K as K1, and the
   rightmost CIPHER_KEY_LEN bits of K as K2.  Secondly, the PRF F* is
   applied to K1, the plaintext P, and all of the n associated data
   strings AD1, ..., ADn.  This results in an authentication tag, T.
   The SIV is defined as the leftmost IV_LEN bits of T.  If TAG_LEN =
   IV_LEN, then T is used in its entirety.  The plaintext P is then
   encrypted using E, with K2 as the key and SIV as the IV, producing
   ciphertext C.  The concatenation of T with C is returned as the
   output of the function.

   In pseudocode, generalised SIV encryption is as follows:

   SIV-ENCRYPT[F*,E](K, P, AD1, ..., ADn) {
       K1 = leftmost(K, PRF_KEY_LEN)
       K2 = rightmost(K, CIPHER_KEY_LEN)
       T = F*(K1, AD1, ..., ADn, P)
       SIV = leftmost(T, IV_LEN)
       C = E.encrypt(K2, SIV, P)

       return T || C
   }

2.2.  Decryption

   Decryption takes as input a key, K, an authenticated ciphertext Z,
   and zero or more associated data blocks to be authenticated but not
   decrypted.

   Keys K1 and K2 are derived as for encryption.  The leftmost TAG_LEN
   bits of Z are taken as the tag T, while the remaining bits are the
   ciphertext C.  As for encryption, the SIV is taken as the leftmost
   IV_LEN bits of T.  The ciphertext C is then decrypted using E with
   the key K2 and SIV as the IV, producing plaintext P.  The expected
   authentication tag T' is then computed using F* over the key K1, the
   associated data AD1, ..., ADn, and the plaintext P.  If T' exactly
   matches T then the plaintext P is returned.  If T' does not match T
   then the implementation MUST NOT return P and MUST destroy P and T'
   and return a failure.  Authentication tag comparisons SHOULD be
   performed in constant time to avoid leaking the true value of T'
   through timing differences.

   SIV-DECRYPT[F*,E](K, Z, AD1, ..., ADn) {
       T = leftmost(Z, TAG_LEN)
       C = rightmost(Z, len(Z) - TAG_LEN)
       K1 = leftmost(K, PRF_KEY_LEN)
       K2 = rightmost(K, CIPHER_KEY_LEN)
       SIV = leftmost(T, IV_LEN)

       P = E.decrypt(K2, SIV, C)
       T' = F*(K1, AD1, ..., ADn, P)

       if T = T' then
           return P
       else
           destroy P and T'
           return FAIL
       fi
   }

2.3.  Generalised S2V

   SIV requires a PRF that takes a vector of strings as input, while
   most PRFs in current use are designed to only take a single string.
   In principle, any unambiguous encoding can be used to convert a
   vector of inputs into a single string, but SIV defines a particularly
   efficient encoding provided by the function S2V (for "string to
   vector") that converts a single-string PRF to a vector input PRF.
   S2V is defined using bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) and a doubling
   operation in the finite field GF(2^n) where n is the bit length of
   the output of the PRF.  For AES-SIV, which uses AES-CMAC as the PRF,

   this is GF(2^128).  In this section we show how to define S2V for
   PRFs with different tag lengths.

   Points in the finite field GF(2^n) are represented as n-bit strings
   a_(n-1) ... a_1 a_0, which can also be seen as binary coefficients
   for a polynomial f(x) = a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0.
   Multiplication is then defined as the product of two polynomials,
   with the remainder taken after division by a fixed polynomial.  In
   S2V, the fixed polynomial is the lexicographically first minimum-
   weight primitive polynomial [SIV] (section 2).  For GF(2^128), such a
   primitive polynomial is:

   f(x) = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1

   Primitive polynomials for other fields can be found in published
   tables, such as [HPL-98-135].  The following polynomials are
   indicated for common PRF output sizes:

            +-----------+-------------------------------------+

            | GF(2^192) | f(x) = x^192 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1    |
            | GF(2^224) | f(x) = x^224 + x^9 + x^8 + x^3 + 1  |
            | GF(2^256) | f(x) = x^256 + x^10 + x^5 + x^2 + 1 |
            | GF(2^384) | f(x) = x^384 + x^12 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 |
            | GF(2^512) | f(x) = x^512 + x^8 + x^5 + x^2 + 1  |
            +-----------+-------------------------------------+

   Doubling for S2V is defined as multiplication with the binary value
   0^(n-2)10 (i.e., the number 2 represented as an n-bit binary string).
   The doubling operation can be efficiently implemented as a left-shift
   operation followed by a conditional XOR with an n-bit constant
   derived from the binary coefficients of the primitive polynomial.
   The condition being whether the most significant bit of the value
   being shifted off is 1.  For GF(2^128), the constant is
   0^(120)10000111, with one bits corresponding to x^7, x^2, x and 1
   respectively.  The following table lists the constants for common PRF
   output sizes in binary and hexadecimal form.  Leading zero octets are
   omitted from the hexadecimal format.

   It is recommended that the conditional XOR be performed in constant
   time.  A constant time bit-sliced implementation is provided in
   Appendix A.

   The S2V algorithm parameterised over a particular PRF, F, written
   S2V[F] is as follows, where TAG_LEN is the output size of the PRF in
   bits, dbl(x) is the appropriate doubling operation for TAG_LEN, and
   xorend is defined as in [RFC5297].  The constant <zero> is the
   TAG_LEN sequence of all zero bits, and <one> is TAG_LEN-1 zero bits
   followed by a single 1 bit.  The function pad(X) pads the input to
   TAG_LEN bits by appending a single 1 bit followed by as many 0 bits
   as necessary.

   S2V[F](K, S1, ..., Sn) {
       if n = 0 then
           return F(K, <one>)
       fi
       D = F(K, <zero>)
       for i = 1 to n-1 do
           D = dbl(D) xor F(K, Si)
       done
       if len(Sn) >= TAG_LEN then
           T = Sn xorend D
       else
           T = dbl(D) xor pad(Sn)
       fi
       return F(K, T)
   }

   The original AES-SIV mode of [RFC5297] can be seen as an
   instantiation of the generic SIV construction in this document, with
   the following parameters:

      F* = S2V[AES-CMAC]

      E = AES-CTR where the 31st and 63rd bits of the IV are zeroed
      prior to use as described in [RFC5297] section 2.5.

      PRF_KEY_LEN = 128, 192 or 256 bits

      CIPHER_KEY_LEN = 128, 192 or 256 bits (to match PRF_KEY_LEN).

      IV_LEN = TAG_LEN = 128 bits.

3.  XChaCha20-HMAC-SHA256-SIV

   ChaCha20 is a stream cipher that has been adopted for use in IETF
   protocols by [RFC8439].  It has several attractive properties, most
   notably that it can be implemented efficiently in software and is
   relatively easy to make resistant to cache-timing side-channel
   attacks.  As originally specified, ChaCha20 takes a 256-bit key and a
   64-bit nonce, which was extended to 96-bits when adopted by the IETF.
   A 96-bit nonce is too small to be safely generated randomly (or
   pseudorandomly as in SIV) without artificially limiting the number of
   messages that can be encrypted with a single key.  To address this
   problem, an extended nonce variant known as XChaCha20
   [I-D.arciszewski-xchacha] has been proposed, which increase the nonce
   to 192-bits.  This makes it an excellent choice for an SIV
   instantiation, providing a MRAE cipher mode alternative to AES.

   In principle, any PRF that produces at least a 192-bit output could
   be used with XChaCha20.  For concreteness, we specify the use of HMAC
   [RFC2104] with the SHA-256 secure hash function [RFC6234] as HMAC-
   SHA256 is widely implemented.  The S2V function of section 2.3 is
   used to allow HMAC-SHA256 to take a vector of strings as input, with
   the primitive polynomial for GF(2^256) used for point doubling and
   the leftmost 192 bits of the S2V[HMAC-SHA256] tag used as the
   synthetic IV for XChaCha20.

   The encryption and decryption procedures are as described in sections
   2.1 and 2.2 above, with the following constant values:

      PRF_KEY_LEN = 256 bits.

      CIPHER_KEY_LEN = 256 bits.

      IV_LEN = 192 bits.

      TAG_LEN = 256 bits.

   Test vectors for XChaCha20-HMAC-SHA256-SIV are provided in
   Appendix A.

4.  IANA considerations

   This section registers AEAD algorithms as per the registry
   established in [RFC5116].  As specified in [RFC5297] section 6, the
   interface of RFC 5116 only allows a single associated data (AD)
   component.  When SIV is accessed via this interface, multiple AD
   components must be marshalled into a single string prior to calling
   the SIV procedures.

4.1.  AEAD_XCHACHA20_SIV_HMAC_SHA256

   The AEAD_XCHACHA20_SIV_HMAC_SHA256 algorithm is an instantiation of
   the generalised SIV mode described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 with the
   XChaCha20 extended-nonce stream cipher [I-D.arciszewski-xchacha] and
   HMAC-SHA256 as the PRF, as described in Section 3.  XChaCha20 uses a
   32-bit block counter and a 512-bit block size, therefore the maximum
   size of plaintext that can be encrypted in a single invocation is
   2^38 octets, around 256 GB.  The ciphertext length is equal to the
   length of the plaintext plus 32 octets for the HMAC-SHA256
   authentication tag (of which the leftmost 24 octets comprise the
   SIV).

   The input and output lengths for AEAD_XCHACHA20_SIV_HMAC_SHA256 as
   defined by [RFC5116] are:

      K_LEN is 64 octets.
      P_MAX is 2^38 octets.
      A_MAX is unlimited.
      N_MIN is 1 octet.
      N_MAX is unlimited.
      C_MAX is 2^38 + 32 octets.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5297] apply here.

   The security proofs for SIV [DAE] require that F* (and F if
   constructing F* using S2V) behaves as a pseudorandom function (PRF).
   E must be a length-preserving semantically-secure encryption scheme.

   It is RECOMMENDED that SIV mode is always used with a unique random
   component included as the last element of the header (associated
   data) to ensure semantic security.  While SIV mode loses a minimal

   amount of security if this component is omitted (or accidentally
   reused), an attacker in this case is able to determine if the same
   plaintext has been encrypted under the same key and with the same
   associated data.  Depending on the application this may still be a
   significant loss of confidentiality.  For example, a service that
   produces yes/no answers to questions would lose all confidentiality
   of its responses in this case.  The misuse resistance of SIV should
   be considered a failsafe and not as a way to do without a nonce.

   The requirement that E be length-preserving means that the ciphertext
   produced by SIV mode will be equal in length to the input plaintext,
   plus the authentication tag (which is of fixed size for any concrete
   instantiation of this mode).  If the length of the plaintext on its
   own may reveal information then care should be taken to obscure this
   prior to encryption -- by padding to a known maximum length, for
   example.  In the case of the yes/no answer service the English words
   "yes" and "no" can be distinguished purely by length, to give a
   simple example.

   In [tightness], Chatterjee, Menezes and Sarkar show an attack on SIV
   within the multi-user setting.  It is RECOMMENDED that concrete
   instantiations intended for such use define a MAC_KEY_LENGTH of at
   least 256 bits or describe other countermeasures.

   The number of components passed to any invocation of S2V (including
   the plaintext) must not exceed TAG_LEN - 1.  For example, a 128-bit
   PRF such as AES-CMAC should allow no more than 127 components.  For
   XChaCha20-HMAC-SHA256-SIV no more than 255 components should be
   allowed.
