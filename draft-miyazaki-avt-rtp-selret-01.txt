1. Abstract

   This document describes a new RTP payload format and a new RTCP
   packet format to enable multiple selective retransmissions of
   generic media data. This payload format is especially applicable in
   a RTP-RX profile as described in [9].

   While RTP is widely used for media streaming applications over the
   Internet, using it over unreliable links needs some further
   modifications to achieve a good quality of the media stream at the
   receiver.

   The aforementioned RTP-RX profile describes a generic retransmission
   mechanism to make RTP more reliable. This payload format description
   increases the reliability and decreases the bandwidth requirements
   of such a generic profile by introducing the concept of multiple
   selective retransmissions.

 Selective Retransmissions for RTP                         July 14, 2000




   This paper describes a mechanism to use the lower delay requirements
   in streaming applications to make RTP more reliable, by the means of
   multiple selective retransmissions. Therefore a new RTP payload
   format is defined as well as a new RTCP packet. An example algorithm
   to use the new payload format fields and the new RTCP packet is
   introduced and an additional section shows results of a performance
   evaluation. The evaluation is done by simulating a video streaming
   application over an mobile communication system.

3. Introduction

   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)[3] was designed as an Internet
   protocol to transmit real-time (or near real-time) data over
   multicast or unicast. Even though the multicast capability is a
   strong feature of RTP, a common use of it is non-interactive unicast
   transmission of media streams. This application, further referred to
   as media streaming, has lower delay requirements. A constant offset
   delay, in which already received packets are stored at the client, is
   tolerable.

   Typically RTP is run over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)[4]. While
   the unreliable UDP performs good for reliable channels, the quality
   of the received media stream is bad, when transmitted over error-
   prone links. Especially compressed streams, such as MPEG video-data,
   are highly susceptible to packet loss, which will lead to a bad
   video quality at the client. E.g. in a wireless environment with a
   unstable transmission quality (bit error rate (BER) about 10E-3 ..
   10E-6) a sufficient quality of video and voice transmitted by RTP
   cannot be achieved.

   The scenario for such a media streaming over an error-prone link
   might be the one in Figure 1.  Media files are stored on a media
   server which is connected via an internet link to a mobile network.
   The wireless link between the mobile network and the mobile
   terminal, which works as the client in this scenario, is generally
   unreliable and subject to bit errors.

 Selective Retransmissions for RTP                         July 14, 2000




   To achieve a better quality of the received media stream, especially
   when transmitted over error-prone links, retransmissions of lost
   packets of the stream seems to be a possible solution. However the
   quite low delay requirements of media streaming applications and the
   bandwidth limitations of the wireless link have to be considered. In
   wireless systems bandwidth is a scarce resource and efficient use of
   this resource is of vital importance. Hence reliability for the
   complete media stream might not be achievable.

   Furthermore in compressed media streams, e.g. MPEG video stream, not
   every frame is equal important. In this example some frames contain
   data that other data depends upon, which makes these frames more
   important. Current protocols applying retransmission for reliable
   transmission (e.g. TCP)  make no use of this characteristic of
   compressed media streams.


4. Proposed solution

   Much work has been done recently to make RTP more reliable. As one
   result a new profile for unicast sessions is proposed [9]. This
   profile includes the ability to request retransmissions of lost
   packets. However the profile is kept very general and leaves space
   for a payload format to define further details and enhance the
   functionality.

   The solution presented in this document is based on the concept of
   multiple selective retransmissions of data packets in case of packet
   loss. This functionality is added to the RTP RX profile by the means
   of this payload format.

   As mentioned before, compressed media streams generally consist of
   data packets of high importance and data packets of lower
   importance. In the proposed solution data packets of high importance
   are retransmitted in case of packet loss and by this the quality of
   the received media stream is increased significantly.
   However single retransmission of lost data packets, which are
   transmitted over links with high bit error rates are still far from
   being reliable. Even though no 100% reliability is desired, the
   delay requirements and bandwidth limitations might allow more than
   one retransmission of important parts of the media stream. Therefore
   mechanisms for multiple retransmission attempts are included in our
   proposal.

   On the other hand by limiting the retransmissions on only the data
   packets of high importance and transmitting the data packets of
   lower importance the usual unreliable way the delay requirements of
   media streaming can still be meet. Additionally the total bandwidth
   requirements for transmission and retransmission of the media stream

   data are kept at a low level suitable and advantageous for usage
   over bandwidth limited, wireless links.

   To keep also the bandwidth requirements on the link back from the
   client to the media server at a minimum level, means for a judgement
   at the client, whether a retransmission would still arrive in time
   (retransmission judgement), is proposed. With our solution it is
   possible to calculate the time when the lost packet has to be
   received at the client at latest. This time is compared against the
   round trip time. Only if this calculation predicts that a
   retransmission of the lost packet will be received in time, a
   retransmission is generated at the client and send to the server.
   Therefore no bandwidth is wasted for unnecessary retransmission
   requests and subsequent retransmissions.

   In summary we propose the following enhancements/extensions to RTP:

   1) Selective retransmission
      Retransmission of lost packets, but limited to lost packets of
      high importance.

   2) Multiple retransmission attempts
      In case retransmission of a lost data packet fails, further
      attempts can be requested.

   3) Retransmission with time limit based on client judgement
      Means to calculate the time when a lost packet has to be received
      at the client at latest to perform a efficient client based
      retransmission judgement.

   RTP packet retransmissions in a unicast scenario are an essential
   part of the proposed RTP-RX profile [9]. The profile is kept very
   general and could be used as a starting point. However, to enable
   the items listed above, additions are needed. These are described in
   the following sections.


5. Concept of a second sequence number

   In this section the concept of a second sequence number is
   described, which enables to do multiple retransmissions very
   efficiently.

   Normally a loss of a transmitted RTP packet can be realized by a gap
   in the sequence numbers of the received packets. This is a very time
   efficient way to detect packet loss, since it does not introduce
   additional traffic or delay.

   However, retransmissions of lost RTP packets need to have the same
   sequence number as the original transmitted packet, because the

 Selective Retransmissions for RTP                         July 14, 2000




   sequence number is used for other purposes than packet loss
   detection as well (e.g. synchronization, coping with reordering).
   Therefore it is not possible to detect a lost retransmission by
   looking at the sequence numbers.

   Other mechanisms to detect packet loss (e.g. acknowledgements,
   timer-based loss detection) have the disadvantage that they either
   introduce additional traffic or delay. Both is not desirable,
   especially not for delay sensitive traffic over a bandwidth limited
   channel.

   To overcome these problems, the following mechanism is used to
   detect lost retransmissions. A second sequence number (SSN) is
   introduced. For every packet that is (re)transmitted the source
   decides if the packet should be retransmitted if it gets lost. If it
   should be retransmitted it gets a new SSN assigned. If it should not
   be retransmitted, it carries the SSN of the previous packet. With
   this mechanism, the client can detect lost packets, which should be
   retransmitted.


6. Payload header in a new RTP payload format

   In order achieve the solution described above, we extend the RTP
   header in the RTP payload format by the following fields.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   The first part of the header is the usual RTP header with a payload
   format identifier set to this new payload format "MulSelRx". The
   payload contains an additional payload header consisting of 4 bytes.
   The fields of this additional header are explained as follows:

     SSN Indicator (S): 1bit
          If this bit is set to one, the packet should be retransmitted
          if it is lost. Therefore it has a new SSN value assigned,
          which is incremented by one to the previous packetÆs SSN.
          If this bit is set to zero, the packet should not be
          retransmitted if it is lost and therefore carries the SSN
          value of the previous packet.

     Payload Type (PT): 7 bits
          This fields identifies the payload format that follows the
          header additions and is used as described in [3].

     Second Sequence Number (SSN): 8 bit
          The second sequence number is carried in this field. It is
          used as describe in section 5.

     Diff Time Indicator(D): 1 bit
          If DTI field is set to one, the diff time field is
          included in the RTP header extension. For further information
          please refer to description of diff time field.
          If it is set to 0 no diff time is transmitted and the
          diff time field is not valid.

     Diff Time: 15 bit
          This field indicates the difference between the time stamp of
          the last RTP packet that should be retransmitted if lost
          (i.e. S==1) and that of the current RTP packet. It can be
          used by the receiver to compute the timestamp of a lost
          packet.
          The default unit of this field is [ms] and by default the
          following table is used to encode the diff time values.

7. RTCP packet type

   The retransmission request, which is sent from the sender to the
   receiver to request the retransmission of a lost packet has to
   contain the SSN value that is requested. The RTCP packet that is
   used in the RTP-RX profile to request retransmissions can be used
   for this purposes. It contains a 16 bit packet identification (PID)
   and 16 payload specific bits. These fields are used as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      version(V), padding(P), report count(RC), packet type(PT),
      length, SSRC and SSRC_1:
         as described in [9], Section 4.2.

      packet identification(PID):
         The SSN value of the requested packet is inserted in this
         field. Since the SSN is only 8 bit long, the upper 8 bits are
         not used in this field.
         If several packets are requested (i.e. SSN_BLP != 0) this
         indicates the lowest SSN value of all requested packets.

      SSN bitmask of following lost packets(SSN_BLP):
         By the means of this bitmask it is possible to request more
         than one lost packet. The use is similar as described in [9]
         section 4.3.


8. Indicating usage in SDP

   Packets of this format contain RTP packets with dynamic payload type
   values. These values have to be indicated in SDP as well as the
   value for this payload format. An example indication within SDP
   would be:

   m= video 0 RTP/AVP-RX xx yy

 Selective Retransmissions for RTP                         July 14, 2000




   The first payload type value indicate the multiple selective
   retransmission payload type and the second the used media payload
   type.


9. An example use of the payload format

   In sections 4 and 5 we proposed a solution to enhance the quality of
   media stream, transmitted over an unreliable link. How this solution
   can be achieved by using the header fields as described in section 6
   and 7 is shown in form of an example in this section.

9.1 Selective retransmission

   As described before a media stream contains more or less important
   parts. In section 6 we introduced a SSN indicator bit (S) which is
   used to mark packets, that should be retransmitted if they are lost.
   Hence these packets should contain the important parts of the media
   stream. With this it is possible to distinguish between two priority
   levels, and to allow retransmissions of only the important packets.

9.2 Multiple retransmission attempts

   If a retransmission fails, further attempts to retransmit the lost
   packet MAY be requested. While the detection of a lost packet is
   normally straight forward (e.g. by checking the sequence number),
   detecting a lost retransmission requires further mechanisms. This is
   done by the means of the SSN field as described in section 5.

   The SSN value MUST be incremented by one for every packet that
   should be retransmitted, regardless whether it is a retransmission
   or sent for the first time. By comparing the actual received with
   the most recent SSN value, the client will detect the loss of a high
   priority packet immediately (i.e. if the SSN value was increased,
   but no packet with S=1 was received, it must have been lost). This
   enables the client to send another retransmission request and the
   server to do multiple retransmissions.

9.3 Retransmission with time limit based on client judgement

   As described in section 3, bandwidth might be a very scarce
   resource. Therefore requesting the retransmission or retransmitting
   packets that will not be received in time anyway, SHOULD be avoided.
   Hence in this example the client estimates the arrival time of the
   requested lost packet and the time after which it will become
   useless. Therefore the RTP timestamp of the lost packet is needed,
   which is achieved by using the diff-timestamp field.

   In these fields the difference between the actual packet's time
   stamp and the most recent packet's timestamp that should be

 Selective Retransmissions for RTP                         July 14, 2000




   retransmitted is calculated. At detecting a lost packet with S=1, it
   is possible to calculate the timestamp of the lost packet by the
   means of this field, because the received packet contains its own
   timestamp and the difference to the lost packet's timestamp.

   The knowledge of the lost packet's time stamp enables the client to
   judge if a retransmission request would still make sense or if the
   bandwidth should be saved.


10. Performance evaluation of the proposed solution

   The previous sections introduced a solution, how to enhance the
   capabilities of media streaming application over unreliable links.
   The solution implies a new RTP payload format and a new RTCP packet
   as described in sections 6 and 7. How these fields can be used in
   general is described in an example in section 8.

   This section will show the increased performance that is possible
   with our solution. This is done by simulating a video streaming
   application over a unreliable wireless link.

10.1 Application

   In this performance evaluation we simulate a MPEG4 video streaming
   application. MPEG4 video data is streamed from a server to a client
   (i.e. unicast). In the client the received frames are buffered
   before they are displayed at their scheduled playing time. Therefore
   the delay requirements are not exactly real-time. The scheduled
   playing time includes an additional buffering delay.

   We consider a transmission of a real MPEG4 video stream, with a
   total play time of about 120s and an average bit rate of 33100 bps.
   The frame rate is 10 fps. The frame length is variable between
   100byte and 2000byte. The additional allowed buffering delay is set
   in our simulations to 2 seconds.

   The MPEG4 video stream consists of Intra coded (I-)frames and
   Predictive coded (P-)frames. While the I-frames are completely
   independent and can be displayed all by themselves, the P-frames
   contain only the difference to the previous frame and hence need the
   previous frame to be received correctly to be displayed. This leads
   to I-frames having a higher importance than P-frames. The different
   frames are mapped into different RTP packets with packets containing
   an I-frame having S=1 and packets containing P-frames having S=0
   assigned.

10.2 Environment

   A mobile environment is considered as a typical representation for
   unreliable, bandwidth limited links. Figure 1 illustrates the
   general scenario that is evaluated. The used protocols for the
   evaluation are shown in Figure 2.

   The RTP layer implies the newly defined RTP payload format and RTCP
   packet as described in sections 5 and 6 and the use of the
   additional fields as given in the example in section 7. Additional
   to the client's retransmission judgement, a similar mechanism is
   used on the server side, to avoid unnecessary retransmissions.

   The Internet link is modeled as error-free, loss-less and with a
   constant delay of 50 ms.

   For the wireless link a W-CDMA channel is considered. W-CDMA, as a
   third generation mobile communication system with high Quality-of-
   Service (QoS) capabilities, is a well suited network for this kind
   of applications in a mobile use.

   The W-CDMA system is standardized at the 3rd Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP). The standardization is still under progress and no
   final specifications are finished. For the simulations the
   specifications of December 1999 are considered. The wireless link
   and its link layer protocols are simulated according to this
   specifications (see [7] for details).

   A single user is considered for the mobile channel, hence the
   bandwidth is not shared between different users here. The channel is
   simulated with the fading model, as described in [8]. The fading
   process has a mean signal-to-noise ratio per received symbol of
   Es/N0. Different mean Es/N0 values are simulated, which reflect
   different channel conditions.

   The back channel in our simulations is modeled as error-free and
   therefore loss-less.

   The propagation delay of the mobile channel, is strongly dependent
   on the length of the packet that is to be sent. The minimum delay of
   50ms applies for all transmitted frames, due to the coding,
   interleaving etc. in the physical layer.

10.3 Performance results

   This section shows some results of the simulations as described
   above. To measure the quality of the received video stream, the
   number of displayed frames, relative to the number of sent frames,
   is considered.

   The next figure shows the amount of received frames for RTP and the
   extended RTP for different channel conditions.






















   It can be seen from this figures, that both applications suffer from
   bad channel conditions.

   In states, where Es/N0 is smaller than 5dB, not even half of the
   video frames can be displayed, using normal RTP. In those conditions
   many errors occur, which leads to a loss of many frames.
   Additionally, if an I-frame gets lost, all following P-frames, even
   if they would be received correctly, are discarded.
   The application using the extended RTP as described in section 7,
   performs much better. Even though it suffers from bad channel
   conditions as well, the repetition of lost I-frames, leads to an
   increased performance.
   The next figure shows the amount of displayed P-frames for different
   channel conditions.






















   Even though the lost P-frames are not retransmitted, more frames are
   displayed, using the extended RTP. This is due to the fact, that
   fewer correctly received frames are discarded, because of a lost I-
   frame.

   The next figure shows the amount of received I-frames for different
   channel conditions.























   From this figure the effect of the extended RTP is visible best.
   Nearly all I-frames are displayed at the receiver in this case,
   while only half of the frames can be displayed with normal RTP in
   bad channel conditions.

10.4 Conclusions

   It was shown in the previous sections that repetition of important
   media data, leads to a better media quality at the receiver. These
   repetitions are possible, if the lower delay requirements in
   streaming applications are used wisely. To do so, a newly defined
   RTP payload format and RTCP packet are introduced, which enable a
   media server to do multiple, selective retransmissions.
