1.  Introduction

   RFC 7274 [RFC7274] made some changes to the terminology used for MPLS
   Special Purpose Labels, but did not define consistent terminology.

   One thing that RFC 7274 did was to deprecate use of the term
   "reserved labels" when describing a range of labels allocated from a
   registry maintained by IANA.  The term "Reserved" in such a registry
   means "set aside, not to be used", but that range of labels was
   available for allocation according to the policies set out in that
   registry.  The name "Special Purpose Labels" was introduced in RFC
   7274 in place of the previous term, and the abbreviation SPL was
   recommended.

   At the time of writing the first version of this document, the IETF
   was in the process of allocating the very first SPLs from the
   Extended SPL (eSPL) range [RFC8595].  This document discusses and
   recommends terminology and abbreviations to be used when talking
   about and documenting Special Purpose Labels.

   This document updates RFC 3032 [RFC3032] and RFC 7274 [RFC7274] in
   that it changes the terminology for both Base SPLs and Extended SPLs.

Internet-Draft               SPL Terminology                January 2021


   This document applies that terminology change to the relevant IANA
   registry and also clarifies the use of the Entropy Label Indicator
   (7) when immediately preceded by the Extension Label (15).

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Background

   Two sets of SPLs are defined for use in MPLS:

      The range of 0-15, Base Special Purpose Labels (bSPLs), is
      specified in RFC 3032 [RFC3032].

      The range 0-1048575 of eSPLs is specified in RFC 7274 [RFC7274].

      *  the values 0-15 have been reserved never to be allocated

      *  the values 16-239 are available for allocation

      *  the values 240-255 are for experimental use

      *  the values 256-1048575 are currently not available for
         allocation.  A standard track RFC will be needed to allocate
         any labels from this range.

2.1.  GMPLS Special Purpose Labels

   Note that IANA maintains a registry called "Special Purpose
   Generalized Label Values".  Labels in that registry have special
   meaning when present in certain signalling objects, are 32 bits long,
   and are not to be confused with MPLS forwarding plane labels.  This
   document does not make any changes to the GMPLS registry or to how
   labels from that registry are described.

3.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   IANA maintains a name space for 'Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Values' code points [SPL-NAME-SPACE].  Within
   this name space there are two registries.  One is called the
   'Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values' registry [bSPL].  The other is
   called 'Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values' registry [eSPL].




Andersson, et al.         Expires July 25, 2021                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SPL Terminology                January 2021


   The difference in the name of the name space and the first registry
   is only that the MPLS abbreviation is expanded.  This document
   changes the name of the first registry to 'Base Special-Purpose MPLS
   Label Values', but leaves the name of the latter registry unchanged
   as 'Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values'.

   The following conventions will be used in specifications and when
   talking about SPLs.

   o  Collectively, the two (unrelated) ranges (0-15 and 16-1048575) are
      known as Special Purpose Labels (SPL).

   o  Special purpose labels from the range 0-15 are called Base Special
      Purpose Labels (bSPL).

   o  Special purpose labels from the range 16-1048575 are called
      Extended Special Purpose Labels (eSPL).  (Note that the reserved
      values 0-15 from the 'Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values'
      registry do not need a name as they are not available for
      allocation and MUST NOT be used.)

   o  The combination of the Extension Label (XL) (value 15 which is a
      bSPL, and which is also called the xSPL) and an eSPL is called a
      Composite Special Purpose Label (cSPL).

   This results in a label stacks such as the illustrative examples
   shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

4.  Clarification on Handling of the Entropy Label Indicator

   Section 3.1 of [RFC7274] contains two paragraphs that describe the
   handling of the Entropy Label Indicator (label 7).  These paragraphs
   have introduced some confusion about whether the Entropy Label
   Indicator can be present when immediately preceded by the Extension
   Label.  This document updates [RFC7274] by replacing those paragraphs
   as follows.

   OLD

      Values 0-15 of the "Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values"
      registry are set aside as reserved.  Furthermore, values 0-6 and
      8-15 MUST NOT appear in the data plane following an XL; an LSR
      processing a packet with an XL at the top of the label stack
      followed by a label with value 0-6 or 8-15 MUST drop the packet.

      Label 7 (when received) retains its meaning as Entropy Label
      Indicator (ELI) whether a regular special-purpose label or an
      ESPL; this is because of backwards compatibility with existing
      implemented and deployed code and hardware that looks for the ELI
      without verifying if the previous label is XL or not.  However,
      when an LSR inserts an entropy label, it MUST insert the ELI as a
      regular special-purpose label, not as an ESPL.

   NEW

      Values 0-15 of the "Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values"
      registry are set aside as reserved.  Furthermore, an
      implementation MUST NOT place a label with value 0-15 in the label
      stack immediately following an XL; an LSR processing a packet with
      an XL at the top of the label stack immediately followed by a
      label with value 0-15 MUST drop the packet.

Internet-Draft               SPL Terminology                January 2021


      When inspecting a label stack to find an Entropy Label Indicator
      (ELI - label 7) a pre-existing implementation may fail to inspect
      the previous label, and so not notice that it is an XL.  Such
      systems can continue to process the entropy information and
      forward the packet when the previous label is an XL without
      causing harm.  However, the packet will be dropped when the XL
      reaches the top of the stack at another LSR.

5.  Security Considerations

   The document describes the terminology to be used when describing and
   specifying the use of SPLs.  It does not effect the forwarding in the
   MPLS data plane, nor does it have any effect on how LSPs are
   established by an MPLS control plane or by a centralized controller.

   This document does not aim to describe existing implementations of
   SPLs or potential vulnerabilities of SPLs.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to change the name of the registry that today is
   called "Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values" is changed to "Base
   Special- Purpose MPLS Label Values".

7.  Acknowledgements

   We like to thank the Routing Directorate reviwer Eric Gray for a
   detailed, careful and insightful review, and Tom Petch for pointing
   out several issues of clarity.
