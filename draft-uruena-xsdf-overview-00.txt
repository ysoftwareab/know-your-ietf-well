Abstract

   This document provides an overview of the eXtensible Service
   Discovery Framework (XSDF). It defines a collection of extensible
   protocols and agents for the dynamic location of network services.
   XSDF Service Discovery Framework is scalable and can be deployed from
   unmanaged LANs up to Internet-wide Service Location. XSDF also
   provides several mechanisms to select among the available services
   discovered. This allows service providers to implement load sharing
   or active/backup policies among multiple servers providing the same
   service.

1. Introduction

   Service Discovery term refers to the process that allows an User to
   find a Service. In particular, the main information to be discovered
   for network Services is its location, that is, the combination of
   network addresses of the server which is running that Service
   instance, and a transport protocol port where the Service process is
   listening. Until the day in which Service Discovery Frameworks will
   be widely deployed, clients need to known just the hostname of the
   server providing such Service, as most Services employ well-known
   ports.

   This situation requires User's workstation to be pre-configured with
   the name of the servers providing network Services. This approach
   lead to high administrative costs, specially when adding new Services
   to the network. When clients are mobile and connect to several
   networks, manual configuration becomes a real issue.

   That is the rationale behind the development of Service Discovery
   Frameworks. This document provides an overview of the eXtensible
   Service Discovery Framework. XSDF defines a collection of application
   protocols and entities, aimed to manage information about network
   Services as its existence, location, and management data.

   XSDF is an evolution of the Service Location Protocol (SLP) [1]. It
   also tries to be compliant with the requirements [4] defined by the
   Reliable Server Pooling (Rserpool) Working Group. The main features
   of XSDF and its differences with SLP are:

   Enhanced Service Model: SLP describes a Service with an URL and a set
      of attribute-value pairs. Also, SLP services are identified by its
      URL, which is known to be the source of some problems [5]. In
      XSDF, services are identified by an UUID [6] and could be defined
      by employing an extensible hierarchical representation data model.

   Internet-wide location: SLP was designed for Service Discovery in
      Local Area Networks inside a single administrative domain. XSDF
      has been designed to allow Service Discovery from remote sites by
      querying public Service Directory Agents advertised in DNS SRV
      Resource Records [3].

   Load balancing: Although Service selection is an important step in
      the Service Discovery process, SLP does not provide a standard
      mechanism to choose the best service located. XSDF includes the
      service selection model of Rserpool thus enabling common selection
      mechanisms as load balancing or primary/backup servers. Such
      selection process can be done both, by the end hosts and by the
      XSDF Directory Agents. As XSDF Agents are themselves Services,

      they can employ the XSDF Framework to discover other low loaded
      XSDF Agents.

   End-to-End solution: As end clients are aware of the different
      servers from a pool, they can connect directly to the chosen one.
      Therefore there is not need of stateful middleware, as in other
      solutions like L4/L7 switches.

   High Availability: Once deployed, Service Discovery may became a
      critical component of the Network. XSDF defines the XSTP/XSSP
      protocols to provide a scalable and highly available Service
      repository distributed among multiple DAs sharing a common Realm.

   Zero Configuration: As in SLP, neither UAs nor SAs need to be
      configured with the location of DAs. XSDF may also bootstrap by
      employing multicast searches and DA advertisements. However, as
      DAs are Services themselves, XSDF does not require special
      messages for DA Discovery. In a XSDF capable network, a client
      does not need to know any Service but IP connectivity (via DHCP or
      IPv6 autoconf.). Then, it may be able to obtain any kind of
      Service information, for example the local DNS server.

   As in SLP, XSLP only handles Service Discovery (and additionally
   Service selection). Once an UA choose one Service, it will employ any
   other protocol outside of the scope of XSDF (unless it was also a
   XSDF Service, of course). XSDF will just provide the location and
   protocol information to begin further Service communication.

   This document does not contain the specification of XSDF protocols
   but an overview of the XSDF Framework. XSDF protocols are defined in
   separate documents. See [8] for a detailed description of common XSDF
   procedures and data structures.

1.1 Definitions

   Domain: A Domain is a single administrative organization containing
      Users and Services.

   Scope: A Scope is a subset of Users and Services from a Domain,
      typically making a logical administrative group.

   Realm: A Realm is a combination of a Domain and one or more Scopes
      from such Domain, if any.

   Service: A Service is any process attached to a network that provides
      some kind of functionality to Users or other Services. A Service
      belongs to a single Realm.

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   User Agent (UA): A process working on the User's (or other process)
      behalf to discover Services, and select the best available one.
      UAs obtain Service information from Directory Agents and Service
      Agents via XSLP.

   Service Agent (SA): A Service Agent is itself a Service that
      advertise Service information on behalf other processes. SAs are
      queried by User Agents for Services via XSLP, and/or register
      Service information in Directory Agents employing XSRP.

   Directory Agent (DA): A Directory Agent is a Service that, when
      deployed, acts as a central repository of all Service information
      from a Realm. Service Agents register its Services in a DA
      employing the XSRP protocol. Then, User Agents are able to query
      that information with XSLP. An Scope can be served by multiple DAs
      that coordinate themselves via XSSP & XSTP protocols.

   XSDF Agent: Any process that employs any XSDF protocol to interact
      with other XSDF Agents. Depending on the protocol a XSDF Agent may
      behave as a client or as a server (i.e. becoming itself a
      Service).

2. Architecture

   A XSDF Framework is formed by multiple XSDF Agents and several
   protocols to communicate them. Each of these protocols deals with a
   different part of the Service Discovery process. The XSDF protocols
   are:

   eXtensible Service Location Protocol (XSLP): User Agents employ this
      protocol to get Service information from Service Agents and/or
      Directory Agents. Please note that a SA or a DA can behave as an
      UA and query other SAs/DAs for XSDF Service information. XSLP
      protocol specification can be found at [9].

   eXtensible Service Register Protocol (XSRP): When a Scope is served
      by one or more Directory Agents, Service Agents register Service
      information in such DAs, thus aggregating all Services of the
      Scope in a central cache. XSRP is the protocol employed by SAs to
      register Service information in a DA. XSRP protocol specification
      can be found at [10].

   eXtensible Service Subscription Protocol (XSSP): This protocol allows
      a XSDF Agent to subscribe itself to any changes made to Service
      information by registering a notification channel. All changes
      affecting the specified subscription are sent through that
      channel. Directory Agents with common Scopes employ this protocol
      to be subscribed to Service registration operations from those
      Scopes. XSSP protocol specification can be found at [11].

   eXtensible Service Transfer Protocol (XSTP): In order to achieve high
      availability or just scalability, a single Scope can be served by
      several Directory Agents. Those DAs employ the XSTP protocol to
      obtain the Services known by the other DAs, and to notify
      subscribed Services with XSRP operations affecting Service
      information registered in the common Scope. XSTP protocol
      specification can be found at [12].

   All XSDF protocols are quite simple client-server ones. That allows
   UAs, and specially SAs, to be implemented in embedded platforms with
   low processing power.

   XSDF messages may be encoded with any suitable encoding mechanism for
   hierarchical structured data, as XML does. However, XBE32 [7] binary
   encoding is preferred as it is more compact, and can be more easily
   parsed than plain XML.

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   This figure provides an overview of the XSDF architecture and its
   protocols:

             +----+ XSLP  +----+  XSTP  +----+  XSRP +----+
             | UA | ----> | DA | <----> | DA | <---- | SA |
             +----+ XSSP  +----+  XSSP  +----+       +----+
               |                                        ^
               |                  XSLP                  |
               +----------------------------------------+

   The main objective of the XSDF Framework is that User Agents were
   able to obtain information about available Services. Such information
   is maintained by the Service Agents. In small scenarios, UAs are able
   to query SAs for the services via XSLP multicast queries.

   In bigger networks, there is an intermediate Service information
   broker called Directory Agent. A DA does not generate Service
   information but only acts as a central cache of Service information.
   SAs periodically refresh Service information in DAs via XSRP, in
   order that UAs ask them for such information via unicast XSLP.

   When multiple DAs handle the same collection of Services, all DAs
   need to have the same information in order to provide the same view
   to UAs. In that case, DAs employ: XSTP to acquire Service information
   from other DAs, and XSSP to be subscribed to changes in other DA's
   Services in order to quickly apply those changes to its own Service
   cache.

2.1 Realm Model

   As SLP, XSDF employs the Scope mechanism to aggregate Services and
   Users in administrative groups. Therefore, User searches are
   restricted to Services from its own group. XSDF adds the "Domain"
   object to allow remote Service Discovery.

   A Realm is a combination of a domain (if any) and one or more Scopes.
   XSDF Agents must be configured with a Realm, although UAs may search
   for Services in other Realms, that is, from remote Domains.

   Each organization will define Scopes tailored to its needs. However,
   the XSDF Framework defines three default Scopes:

   DEFAULT: By default all Services belong to the "DEFAULT" Scope and
      have no Domain. This well-known Scope is useful for unmanaged
      networks.

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   LOCAL: Services that belong to this Scope, are only meaningfully to
      the local server. For example managing Services as SNMP or SSH/
      Telnet.

   PUBLIC: Public services from remote domains belong to the Realm with
      the specified DNS domain and a "PUBLIC" Scope.

   In order to simplify SA and UA implementation, DAs of the same Scope
   behave as a single repository, thus a Service can be registered in a
   single DA but be available by querying any other DAs of the same
   Scope. Please notice that, this description only applies to XSDF
   Agents in the same Scope. As a XSDF Agent may belong to several
   Scopes, it should handle each Scope as a separate environment.

                                   A
                     XSLP        +----+         XSRP
               +---------------> | DA | <---------------+
               |                 +----+                 |
               |            B             B             |
             +----+ XSLP  +----+  XSTP  +----+  XSRP +----+
       A,B,C | UA | ----> | DA | <----> | DA | <---- | SA | A,B,C
             +----+       +----+  XSSP  +----+       +----+
               |                                        ^
               |                  XSLP                  |
               +----------------------------------------+

   For example, in the above figure, the SA has Services from 3
   different Scopes (A, B, C). It should register Services from the
   first one at the single DA that manages that Scope. Services from
   Scope B could be registered at any of the two DAs which serve Scope
   B. Finally, SA should reply to direct UA requests from the last Scope
   as there is no DA managing that Scope. The same applies to XSLP
   queries from UAs. If an UA wants to fetch Services from all the
   Scopes, it will need to send unicast requests to DAs managing those
   Scopes and a Multicast request to query SAs from the unmanaged C
   Scope. Also, only the two DAs sharing the B Scope will employ XSTP/
   XSSP to keep Service information in sync.

2.2 Service Model

   In SLP, a Service is defined by an URL and a set of attribute-value
   pairs. In Rserpool, Service information carries one or more transport
   protocol identifiers, that is, a port and one or more IP address per
   transport protocol, along with selection policy information.

   XSDF Service model mix both approaches with a single extensible
   representation. Service information is divided in four parts:

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   Service Identifier: All Services are identified by a single UUID,
      which is unique inside a Domain.

   Service State: This refers to the volatile information about the
      Service that cannot be cached for long time. A good example of
      State information is the workload of the server. Also, Service
      State includes version information of other Service information.

   Service Main Information: This information defines the Type of the
      Service, its selection policy, and other important
      Service-dependent information.

   Service Location Information: In order to establish a connection with
      a network Service, clients need to known its attachment point to
      the network and the available protocols to access to the Service.
      Location information specifies data such as its IP addresses,
      transport ports and configured application protocols.

   Service Additional Information: While previous information allows
      automatic Service Discovery, the so called Additional Information
      contains data intended for human consumption as a textual
      description of the Service or the mail address of the Service
      administrator.

   When requesting Service information, an UA may specify which kind of
   information it is interested in. This allows automatic UAs to
   download just Service State, Main and Location Information to choose
   a Service, and later just check the State to see if Service
   information need to be updated. All without downloading the
   Additional information that may be quite long as it is very verbose
   for human consumption.

2.3 Cache Model

   In the XSDF Framework, Service information can be stored in multiple
   places. That information is generated and maintained by Service
   Agents and no other XSDF Agent but the home SA should modify Service
   Information. Thus, the only authoritative source of information about
   a Service instance is the home SA. Then, to improve network
   performance, that information may be cached by the other two XSDF
   Agents: UAs and DAs.

   Service Agents assigns a lifetime to its Service information. This
   lifetime specifies the amount of time that Service data is expected
   to remain valid. Therefore, Service information may be cached by UAs
   only until the lifetime period expires.

   A Directory Agent is just a central cache for Service information.



Urue±a & Larrabeiti    Expires September 15, 2004               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   When a SA registers a Service in the DA via XSRP, it specifies the
   expected Lifetime of that information. When an UA requests Service
   information to the DA via XSLP, DA reply also contains the Age an the
   Time To Live of that information.

   Age is the amount of time Service information has been cached in the
   DA before the reply was generated. Time To Live is the amount of time
   left that Service information can be cached in the client. That is,
   time to live equals the lifetime of the Service minus its DA cache
   age. Whenever a SA refresh Service information cached in the DA, age
   is set to zero and time to live is set to the specified lifetime
   value.

   Lifetime value configures the UA cache behavior. However, Service
   information cached in DAs may be flushed before its lifetime expires
   if not refreshed by the home SA. When a Service registration/update
   is acknowledged, DA specifies the "minLife" and "maxLife" values for
   next update. SAs should update Service information before "maxLife"
   time expires but after "minLife". This mechanism has been designed to
   avoid Service update storms from SAs to DAs. It also allows DAs to
   cache, for "maxLife" milliseconds, Service information with zero
   lifetime, that is, that should not be cached by UAs.

                                      lifetime
             +----+  age/ttl  +----+ <-------- +----+
             | UA | <-------- | DA |   XSRP    | SA |
             +----+   XSLP    +----+ --------> +----+
                                    min/maxLife

   XSSP subscriptions follow the same minLife-maxLife mechanism to
   "cache" subscription information. If a subscription is not refreshed
   before maxLife, that subscription is deleted and further
   notifications are not sent to subscription's notification channel.

2.4 Selection Model

   When an UA requests Service information via XSLP, it can found
   several Service instances that fit its needs. In that case, some kind
   of selection process should happen. For example, a list of all
   Services (for example printers) could be shown to the user who
   chooses one of them.

   For Services that allows automatic selection, XSDF provides a version
   of the selection model from Rserpool. Each Service Type may have an
   associated selection policy. Also, each Service instance may provide
   some kind of metric about the "goodness" of the Service.

   XSDF allows each Service Type to define its own selection policy and



Urue±a & Larrabeiti    Expires September 15, 2004               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   related metrics. But defines the following selection policies that
   must be supported by all XSDF implementations:

   Round Robin: This policy states that each time a client wants to
      access a Service, it chooses a different one. Services may have an
      associated "weight" information, thus Service instances with
      greater "weight" should be accessed proportionality more times
      than servers with lower "weight" values.

   Least Used: Services with this policy indicate that clients should
      access to servers with the lowest "workload" state value.

   Most Resources: Services with this policy tell clients that they
      should access to servers with the greatest "resources" state
      value.

   Closest: Services with this policy tell clients that they should
      access to servers with the lowest latency from its point of view.

   Of course, if the selected Service is offline or has zero "resources"
   left, clients should try the next discovered one, sorted by the
   selection policy in use.

   Along with the "weight", "workload" and "resources" values, XSDF
   defines a fourth selection metric that is applied to before other
   selection policies: "priority". When two Services of the same type
   have different "priority" value, clients should access to the Service
   with the greatest one. Only if the Service with the greatest priority
   is offline, clients are able to access the next Service with greater
   priority. When two or more Services have the same priority, one of
   them is chosen following the associated selection policy.

   Unlike ASAP, where selection process is always performed in the
   client side, in XSDF selection process could be done by the UA, the
   DA or both. SAs may include selection information inside the Service
   information in order that UAs choose the best discovered Service.
   Also SAs may specify in the XSRP Service registration, Selection
   information for the DA. In that case, DA sorts the registered
   Services from the same Type and, when an UA requests Service
   information, the DA may provide just the better Services. A SA may
   provide the first, second or both kinds of selection data, which also
   can be different.

3. Applicability Statement

   XSDF could be deployed in a broad set of scenarios, from unmanaged
   LANs to big Enterprise Networks and even in Internet. As each network
   has its own requirements, each scenario will need to deploy all kind
   of XSDF agents and protocols or just a subset of them.

3.1 Unmanaged Networks

   The first scenario is a single LAN that has little or no server
   infrastructure (i.e. no DNS server), for example a SOHO were there
   are only only client stations, or home appliances.

     Scopes: DEFAULT      DEFAULT    DEFAULT
             +----+       +----+     +----+
             | UA |       | SA | ... | SA |
             +----+       +----+     +----+
               |             ^          ^
               |    XSLP     |          |
               +-------------+----------+

   In this scenario, XSDF Service Discovery can be achieved just by
   deploying User Agents and Service Agents at the same "DEFAULT" scope.
   Then, XSLP protocol is employed to perform multicast/broadcast
   searches. If multiple Services are found, selection process will be
   performed by UAs.

3.2 Small Network

   The second scenario is a network with multiple LANs where multicast
   searches are too inefficient. In that case, a Directory Agent should
   be deployed. Therefore Service Agents should employ XSRP to register
   its Services in the DA.

     Scopes:   A            A             A

             +----+       +----+       +----+
             | UA |

                +-------> | DA | <---- | SA |
                   XSLP   +----+  XSRP +----+
     Scopes:   B            B             B

   If the number of Services and Users is small, all XSDF agents may
   belong to the same Scope. Otherwise, multiple Scopes could be
   defined. Those Scopes could be managed by a single DA or by several
   ones but each DA only handles one Scope. As UAs ask DAs for Services,

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   selection process could be done at the DA. Thus, DA may reply to the
   UA with the Service list ordered by server workload.

3.3 Enterprise Network

   The last scenario is an Enterprise network were there are many
   subgroups of Users and Services and also critical Services rely on
   XSDF Service Discovery. Therefore, both scalability and high
   availability of the XSDF Service is required.

     Scopes:   AB           AB            AC           AC
             +----+ XSLP  +----+  XSTP  +----+  XSRP +----+
             | UA | ----> | DA | <----> | DA | <---- | SA |
             +----+ XSSP  +----+  XSSP  +----+       +----+

   In an Enterprise network, there will be multiple Scopes, and Scopes
   with critical Services will be handled by two or more DAs. In that
   case all XSDF protocols will be deployed. XSTP and XSSP will allow
   DAs with common Scopes to share its Service information and provide a
   common view to UAs and SAs. Selection process could not only be done
   in the DAs, but also in the UAs in order to quickly react to server
   failures.

3.4 Internet

   XSDF can be also employed to advertise public Services in Internet.
   For example a pool of Web servers may employ XSDF to achieve load
   balancing. This could be done by deploying public available DAs
   managing the pool Services with "PUBLIC" Scope, and advertising such
   DAs in the DNS server of the organization.

                   1. SRV RR?   +-----+              Server
            +------------------>| DNS |               Pool
            |                   +-----+                +----+
            |                                         +----+|
          +----+ 2. XSLP  +----+  XSTP  +----+  XSRP +----+|+
          | UA | -------> | DA | <----> | DA | <---- | SA |+
          +----+          +----+  XSSP  +----+       +----+
   Scopes:                PUBLIC        PUBLIC       PUBLIC

   In this scenario, an UA willing to contact a Service from the
   "example.com" Domain first will ask for the "_xslp._udp.example.com"
   DNS SRV Resource Record. This record will contain a list of the
   preferred public DAs. Then, the UA is able to ask, via XSLP, for the
   desired Service  (i.e. www) in the "PUBLIC" Scope. At last, the DA
   will reply with the least-loaded, available servers.

4. Security considerations

   XSDF security model is based on the Realm concept. Services and Users
   belong to Realms. Therefore an User (i.e. an UA) should access only
   to Service information from its own Realm. The same applies to other
   XSDF Agents, SAs should register Services only at DAs from compatible
   Realms. These authorization relationships are defined by each
   protocol. For example, an User from a Realm should access via XSLP to
   Service information from that Realm, however he must not be able to
   deregister those Services via XSRP.

   Some Scopes may be public, and any User from other domains may be
   able to obtain information via XSLP. However, others Scopes could be
   restricted and must require authorization in order to grant access.
   In that case, XSDF Agents should be authenticated in order to check
   their access rights.

   XSDF relies on IPSec and TLS to provide authenticated and secure
   protocol message exchange among XSDF Agents. However, XSDF has some
   security mechanisms that should be employed when not provided by
   lower layers (i.e. SCTP already provides a Cookie mechanism).

4.1 Cookie mechanism

   XSDF provides a simple Cookie mechanism to reduce the risk of Denial
   of Service (DoS) attacks. A XSDF server Agent may reject any request
   message without processing it with a reply error message that carries
   a Cookie value. In that case, the client should reissue the same
   message but including this Cookie value. Once a valid Cookie is
   received by the XSDF server, it may process the included operations.
   This mechanism does not prevent DoS attacks but made it harder to
   perform attacks with spoofed IP addresses.

4.2 EAP Authentication

   XSDF provides two kinds of authentication, first one is suitable for
   User authentication while the other one allows Server messages to be
   authenticated.

   Users may be authenticated employing EAP [2] messages. The process is
   very similar to the Cookie mechanism. When an unauthenticated user
   wishes to request a message from a restricted Scope, the XSDF server
   Agent may reject that message without processing it. The reply error
   message will carry an EAP request message, for example a
   MD5-Challenge.

   Then, the client will employ the requested authentication mechanism
   and return the EAP response along with the original XSDF requests.

Internet-Draft               XSDF Overview                    March 2004


   Once properly authorized, XSDF server Agent would perform the
   requested operations.

4.3 Public Key Signature

   The above mechanism may be suitable for, shared secret based, user
   authentication. However, in order to provide server message
   authentication (i.e. DA advertisement), public key signatures are a
   better mechanism.

   XSDF messages may contain a Signature Information Element. That
   element contains a digest of the message, encrypted with the XSDF
   Agent private key. Therefore, any XSDF Agent with the public key of
   the source one may check if the message is valid and has been
   generated by the claimed XSDF Agent.

   When XSDF is deployed in insecure environments, all User Agents must
   know (or obtain via other mechanisms) the public keys of the
   Directory Agents from its Realm, in order to validate DA
   Advertisements. Otherwise, is very easy to advertise a rogue DA and
   compromise the security of, not only XSDF, but other types of
   Services obtained via XSDF.

   For example, a rogue DA may carry out a DoS attack by answering to
   all XSLP request with an empty Service list. Even worse, it may reply
   with rogue Services that perform man-in-the-middle attacks to Users
   and real Services.

5. Acknowledgements

   The eXtensible Service Discovery Framework is an evolution of the one
   defined by the Service Location Protocol, and owes many of the ideas
   discussed at the Srvloc Working Group. Besides, XSDF tries to cover
   some of the requisites defined by the Rserpool Working Group, thus it
   has also benefited from their efforts. Therefore, we wish to thank
   all the RFC and draft authors from both communities, including Erik
   Guttman, Weibin Zhao, James Kempf, John Loughney, Maureen Stillman,
   Quiaobing Xie, Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, and many others.
