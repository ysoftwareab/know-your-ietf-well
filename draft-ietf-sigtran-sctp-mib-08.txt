 Abstract

    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable
    transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet
    network such as IP, designed to transport PSTN signaling messages
    over the connectionless packet network, but is capable of broader
    applications.

    This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which
    describes the minimum amount of objects needed to manage the
    implementation of the SCTP.

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003





 1. Introduction

    This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which
    describes managed objects for implementations of the SCTP.

    The document starts with a brief description of the SNMP framework
    and continues with the MIB explanation and security consideration
    among others.

    The managed objects in this MIB module have been based on [RFC2012]
    update: "Management Information Base for the Transmission Control
    Protocol (TCP)" [TCPMIB], work in progress, and the RFC 3291 "Textual
    Conventions for Internet Network Addresses" [TADDRESS], work in
    progress.

    Terms related to the SCTP architecture are explained in [RFC2960].
    Other specific abbreviations are listed below.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

 2. The SNMP Framework

    The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
    components:


       -  An overall architecture, described in [RFC2571].






 Pastor, Belinchon                                               [Page 3]

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003


       -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
          purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
          Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
          [RFC1155] , [RFC1212] and [RFC1215].  The second version,
          called SMIv2, is described in [RFC1902], [RFC1903] and
          [RFC1904].

       -  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
          first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
          described in [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
          protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
          called SNMPv2c and described in [RFC1901] and [RFC1906]. The
          third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
          described in [RFC1906], [RFC2272] and [RFC2574].

       -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
          first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
          described in [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations
          and associated PDU formats is described in [RFC1905].

       -  A set of fundamental applications described in [RFC2273] and
          the view-based access control mechanism described in [RFC2575].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
    the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
    defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  This memo specifies
    a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the
    SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.  The
    resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
    where objects or events are omitted because no translation is
    possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable information in
    SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the
    translation process.  However, this loss of machine-readable
    information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.



 3. MIB Structure

    This chapter will explain the main objects this MIB defines. A
    detailed view of the MIB structure with the OID values is below.

                   +--(3) sctpPerAssocParamsGroup



    The main groups are further explained along the MIB definition.


 3.1 SCTP Objets

    This branch contains the SCTP statistics and general parameters (both
    of them scalars) and the SCTP MIB tables.


 3.1.1 SCTP Statistics







 Pastor, Belinchon                                               [Page 5]

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003


    SCTP MIB includes both Counter32 and Counter64 to deal with
    statistics. Counter64 has been applied to those counters, which are
    likely to wrap around in less than one hour, according to [RFC2863].

    In addition Gauge32 is also used.


 3.1.1.1 State-Related Statistics

    These measures are based in the TCP model, but adapted to the SCTP
    states. They store the number of succeeded association attempts, how
    many associations have been initiated by the local or the remote SCTP
    layer, or just the number of associations terminated in a graceful
    (by means of SHUTDOWN procedure) or ungraceful way (by means of CLOSE
    procedure).


 3.1.1.2 Statistics for traffic Measurements

    It has been specified statistics related to the whole SCTP layer.
    There are, e.g., statistics related to either SCTP packets or SCTP
    chunks.

    Statistics related to a specific association, or local/remote IP
    addresses are defined inside its concerned table.



 3.1.2 SCTP Parameters

    This section of the MIB contains the general variables of the
    SCTP protocol. Maximum, minimum, initial values, and values by
    default are listed here.

    SCTP RTO mechanism definition is based on the TCP MIB [RFC2012-
    update]. In SCTP protocol, only options 'other' and 'vanj' are valid
    since SCTP protocol defines Van Jacobson's algorithm as the one to
    be used to calculate RTO. 'Other' is left for future use.


 3.1.3 MIB Tables

    There are several tables included in the SCTP MIB. The first group
    deals with the Association variables and is composed of a main and
    two extended tables. The second group is a bunch of tables used for
    the reverse lookup.

    It is NOT possible to create rows in any table (sctpAssocTable,
    sctpAssocLocalAddressTable, sctpRemAddressTable and Reverse Lookup
    tables).





 Pastor, Belinchon                                               [Page 6]

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003


    It is NOT possible to delete rows in any table except in
    sctpAssocTable under the particular conditions explained below.


 3.1.3.1  Association Table

    This is the main MIB table, where all the association related
    information is stored per association basis. It is structured
    according to expanded tables. The main table is called sctpAssocTable
    and is indexed by sctpAssocId (the association identification) that
    is a value that uniquely identifies an association. The MIB does not
    restrict which value must be written here,, however it must be unique
    within the table.

    The sctpAssoc index is also shared by two more tables:
       -  sctpAssocLocalAddressTable: to store the local IP address(-es).
       -  sctpAssocRemAddressTable: to store the remote addresses and the
          per-remote-address(-es)related information.

    Entries in the sctpAssocTable are created when trying to establish
    the association, i.e., when sending the COOKIE-ECHO message
    (originating side) or the COOKIE-ACK message (server side). At this
    point, i.e., at established state, all entry fields are filled in
    with valid values.

    Note: The following representation is a conceptual mode of describing
    the relationship between the tables in this MIB. Note that the real
    relationship of the tables is by sharing an index, so tables are not
    truly within tables. Every entry is explained when defining the
    corresponding objects in the MIB.

    Both sctpAssocLocalAddressTable and sctpAssocRemAddressTable are
    indexed by addresses. 'Address' and 'AddressType' use the syntax
    InetAddress and InetAddressType defined in the Textual Conventions
    for Internet Network Address [RFC 3291]. In the general case this
    syntax is valid for Unknown IP addresses, IPv4, IPv6, non-global
    IPv4, non-global IPv6 address and DNS, but only the IPv4 and IPv6
    address options will be allowed in this MIB.

    The sctpAssocLocalAddressTable table will have as many entries as
    local IP addresses have been defined. The sctpAssocRemAddressTable
    table will contain as many entries as remote IP addresses are known
    to reach the peer. For multihoming concept see reference [RFC2960].

    DNS value is not used to identify an IP address since it is only
    valid during initialization (once this stage is finished, both sides
    only use IP addresses).

    To keep the name of the remote peer (when provided by the peer at
    initialization time), an entry has been created in the sctpAssocTable
    (sctpAssocRemHostName). When no DNS name is provided by the remote
    endpoint, this value will be NULL (zero-length string). Otherwise,
    the received DNS name will be stored here.

    If it is required to abort an existing association, the value
    deleteTCB has to be written in the variable sctpAssocState. That is
    the only way to delete rows in any of the mentioned tables.


 3.1.3.2  Reverse Lookup Table

    There are five reverse lookup tables to help management applications
    to efficiently access conceptual rows in other tables. This is the
    way for not performing expensive tree walks through large number of
    associations.

    All of these tables are optional. In case of implementing them, any
    entry must be created after the main table (sctpAssocTable) concerned





 Pastor, Belinchon                                               [Page 9]

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003


    entry has been created. This ensures that the field indexing the
    lookup table exists.

    The defined reversed lookup tables allow performing a lookup using
    the following variables:

       -  Local Port: It allows a management application to find out all
          the associations that use a specific local port
       -  Remote Port: It allows a management application to find out all
          the associations that use a specific remote port
       -  Remote Host Name: It allows a management application to find
          out all the associations to a specific host name.
       -  Remote Primary IP Address: It allows a management application
          to find out all the associations that use a specific remote IP
          address as primary.
       -  Remote IP address: a management application to find out all the
           associations that use a specific remote IP address.

    As an example the picture below shows the table to look up by local
    port.


    MIB-2 {1 3 6 1 2 2}

           |

                   |
                   +--(3) sctpAssocState



    All the lookup tables contains the sctpAssocState object. This allows
    getting the three objects in an easier way.

    It is not possible to either create or delete rows in these tables.


 3.2 Conformance

    The conformance section recommends as optional the general SCTP
    statistics and those per association or remote IP address statistics.

    Also, IP address will take the format of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (not
    scoped). DNS name will not be accepted either (since names will be
    stored û if present û in the sctpRemoteHostName variable).

 5. Compiling Notes

    After compiling the MIB the following warning can be got:




 Pastor, Belinchon                                              [Page 36]

    @ index of row `sctpLookupRemPrimIPAddrEntry' can exceed OID size
       limit by 141 subidentifier(s)

    This comes from the fact that sctpAssocRemPrimaryAddress has the
    default InetAddress size of (0..255) which exceeds OID size
    limitations. Introducing a size restriction on
    sctpAssocRemPrimaryAddress would make the warning go away û although
    it would be one of those more arbitrary restrictions.

 8. Security Consideration

    The deleteTCB management object, defined in this MIB, has a MAX-
    ACCESS clause of read-write. This is because it allows operators to
    tear down the associations. Such object may be considered sensitive
    or vulnerable in some network environments. The support for SET
    operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can
    have a negative effect on network operations.

    It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
    possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
    over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
    for such a secure environment.

    SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if security
    measures are taken (e.g., using IPSEC), there is no per-user control
    as to who (once an IPSEC association is established between hosts) is
    allowed to GET or SET the objects in this MIB

    It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
    features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
    of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
    based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

    It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
    entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
    configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.

 10. Revision History

    RFC-Editor to remove this section before publication as RFC.


 10.1 Changes from <SCTP-MIB-predraft-01.txt>

    o Open issues updated

    o Section 2: Reference to RFC227x changed to RFC257x

    o Section 4: Inside the sctpRtoAlgorithm definition has been put
    "other" first rather than last.  That way, it won't end up in the
    middle of things when new enumerations are added later.


 10.2 Changes from <draft-ietf-sigtran-sctp-mib-00.txt>

    o Change of "Simple" word to "Stream" word in SCTP acronyms

    o Version of the MIB based on SCTPv10

    o Section 2: Update SNMP Framework to include the standard
    explanation

    o New Structure for the MIB:
                 sctp
               \- sctpObjects
                       \- sctpScalars
                       \- sctpTables
               \- sctpMIBConformance

    o Section 4.1.2: Unit of Conformance updated (functional structure).

    o MAX-ACCESS clauses reviewed

    o The general statistics has been re-ordered, placed before the
    tables.

    o In SMIv2, indexes should be not-accessible (= the object type is a
    column in a table used as index and may not be used as an operand in
    any operation != SMIv1) (pp109-110 in [])

    o IPv6 compatible:
        - Change of Primary/Local/Remote addresses
        - PENDING: check "MODULE-COMPLIANCE"

    o Row Status included in AssocTable, AssocLocal and AssocRem to
    create, modify and delete rows in the tables.

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003



    o SCTP general statistics changed from Counter32 to Counter64 since
    it supports more data changes.

    o sctpCurrEstab ("State-related variables and statistics" section)
    variable changed from Gauge32 to Counter32.

    o sctpAssocRemAddressT1expired and sctpAssocRemAddressT2expired have
    been removed from the remote table and added in the general
    association data since they are variables per association (not per IP
    address).

    o sctpAssocDropDatag statistic has been removed from the general
    association statistics since it had an ambiguous meaning.

    o Explained the meaning of the unordered chunks (chunks in which the
    U bit is set to 1) in sctpStatOutOfOrderSentChunks and
    sctpStatOutOfOrderRecChunks.

    o Added sctpChecksumErrorCounter to collect information about wrong
    checksums received from the peer.

    o Specify that sctpStatSentChunks and sctpStatRecChunks does not
    contain retransmission chunks.

    o Reword the Security Considerations chapter pointing out that IPsec
    does not secure the network but it provides end-to-end security over
    a network.

    o sctpAssocRemAddressRtxChunks replaced as a variable per
    association, meaning the number of chunks retransmited to the peer in
    the current association.

    o sctpHeartBeatMisses and sctpMaxRetr have been replaced from the
    general SCTP statistics to the remote IP address table
    (sctpHeartBeatMisses) and in the association table (sctpMaxRetr).

    o Specify that the retransmissions in the general SCTP statistics
    include control plus data chunks.

    o Included heartbeat timer for remote IP address.

    o Removed sctpAssocRemAddressHeartBeatMisses variable from the remote
    IP address table.

    o Removed sctpAssocRemAddressT3expired variable from the remote IP
    address table.

    o Updated variables to the new SCTP states defined in v10.

    clause.

    o sctpAssocRemHostName - the type OCTECT STRING should be OCTET
    STRING.

    o sctpAssocRemPrimaryAddress - the DESCRIPTION clause is missing its
    closing ouble-quote.

    o sctpConformance - this is defined as { sctpMIB 2 }, then never
    used; instead sctpMIBConformance (which is undefined) is used in the
    definition of sctpMIBGroups and sctpMIBCompliances.

    o Reworded the MIB organization

    o Removed maximum number of concurrent associations

    o In sctpMIBCompliance, removed a missing comma in MANDATORY-GROUPS.

    o In sctpAssocTablesVariablesGroup and sctpAssocStatGroup, removed
    extra commas at end of OBJECTS list.

    o sctpAssocInStreams. ACCESS changed from read-create to read-only.

    o sctpAssocRemAddressHeartBeatFlag and sctpAssocRemAddressHBTimer
    changed from per remote IP address to per association.

    o Comment on sctpAssocRemAddressHBTimer specifies now that the
    manager can change it.

    o ACCESS on sctpAssocRemAddressHBTimer changed from read-only to
    read-write.

    o ACCESS on sctpAssocRemAddressRetransCount changed from read-write
    to read-only.

    o Move sctpStatChecksumErrorCounter from general statistics to per
    association.

    o sctpMaxInStreams û ItÆs a sctp-user feature.

    o sctpStatRetransChunks û ItÆs more useful to have this statistic in
    a association basis

    o sctpAssocRemAddressHeartBeatFlag and sctpAssocRemAddressHBTimer
    have been created again instead of per association in order to follow

    the draft. If some implementations want to have the same value for
    all the associations they have, they should set all the variables in
    the different remote addresses to the same value.


 10.3 Changes from <draft-ietf-sigtran-sctp-mib-02.txt>

    o Deleting all the RowStatus Structure. Associated text rewording in
    Tables section.

    o Variable StartTime added in all the tables in order to specify the
    creation time.

    o Adding the Association reverse lookup table for easier management.
    Associated text rewording in tables section.

    o Remove sctpInitialT1 and sctpInitialT2, since these values are
    equal to RTO.

    o Change of the Heartbeats to a per-association basis

    o Conformance up-to-date with all of this.


 10.4 Changes from <draft-ietf-sigtran-sctp-mib-03.txt>

    Main changes are due to the alignment with the TCP and UDP MIBs and
    the inclusion of new lookup tables.
    o Convert MIB to a read-only


    o Counters ends with ôsö

    o Include ôunknownö as an option for InetAddressType  in conformance

    o Terminology fix: CLOSED state, unordered chunks instead of out-of-
    order, ..

    o HBFlag changed to per remote address

    o ChecksumErrors out of the AssocTable and hangs from Scalars

    o Update Ports from Unsigned32 to InetPortNumber according to
    RFC2851-update

    o Rework inverse tables: five new lookup tables

    o Remove INTEGER32 and change it to UNSIGNED32

    o Replace Counter32 by Counter64

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003


    o Split Sent and Received chunks per association into control,
    ordered and unordered chunks


 10.5 Changes from <draft-ietf-sigtran-sctp-mib-04.txt>

    Changes due to the IETF-51 meeting and requests from the mailing
    list.
    o Typo errors

    o Objects renumbering

    o All counters to Counter32 to be backward compatible, not to waste
    memory. Operators needing more than 32 bits will do it by
    augmentations.

    o Limit the number of IP address size when index

    o Specify that a port number with value zero means unknown port
    number according to the RFC2851-update

    Changes due to the alignment with the RFC2851-update.

    o Include clarification text of the IP address types supported in the
    SCTP MIB. Chapter 3.1.2.1 (Association table)

    o Remote Primary IP address: Addition of the ipv4z an ipv6z types for
    non-globally IP addresses in which a scope identifier is needed.
    Addition of the scope of ipv6 type. All of them according to the
    RFC2851-update v04

    o InetAddressType for local and remote IP addresses:

    Limit UNKNOWN type only for unknown IP address format. Remove UNKNOWN
    type for zero-length value in the InetAddress since it will be never
    zero-length due to the size restriction (0..64)

    Addition of the ipv4z an ipv6z types for non-globally IP addresses in
    which a scope identifier is needed. Addition of the scope of ipv6
    type. All of them according to the RFC2851-update v04

    o Clarify when mapping DNS <-> IPaddress occurs with the remote IP
    addresses

    o Conformance:

    Description: Specify that the SCTP MIB only need to support IPv4/IPv6
    addresses without a zone index, unknown type and DNS names. Support
    for IPv4/IPv6 addresses with zone indices is not required.

 INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                 May, 2003


    InetAddressType for primary, local and remote IP addresses: Clarify
    that the implementation is only required to support IPv4 and IPv6
    address types without zone indices. Clarify also that UNKONWN type is
    only used in case of local and remote addresses when invalid/unknown
    IP address format

    InetAddress value of primary, local and remote IP address: Removal of
    the InetAddress values supported. Limitation of the supported IP
    address types is already included in the InetAddressType

    o Revision of the RFC2851-update v05. Changes in this draft does not
    affect the SCTP MIB.

 10.6 Changes from <draft-ietf-sigtran-sctp-mib-05.txt>

    Changes due to the IPv6mib Design Team and the Sigtran mailing list.

    o RFC2851-update v06 (changes) does not affect the SCTP MIB

    o Typo errors

    o Restructure the MIB organization (tree):
             sctp
               \- sctpParameters
               \- sctpStats

    o Modify conformance section according to the new MIB structure.
    Statistics and lookup tables will be optional

    o Clarify that the SCTP MIB is based on the TCP MIB update
    (RFC2012update) and the TCs for Internet Network Addresses
    (RFC2851update) û remove reference to RFC2452

    o Replace "Sent" by "out" and "Received" by "in" in statistics

    o Change the sctpAssocId to exclude the value zero. This allows other
    MIBs to reference associations and to use the value 0 to indicate no
    association

    o Clarify sctpRemHostName to be zero-length value when no remote host
    name was received at the initialization stage

    o Limit the range of local and remote ports to (1..65535). Value 0
    (unknown port number according to RFC2851-update) is not valid in
    SCTP associations since there is no way of having an assoc with an
    unknown local or remote port

    o sctpAssocRemPrimaryAddressType and sctpAssocRemPrimaryAddress value
    to be filled in with a zero length string until valid values are
    received in the INIT or INIT ACK chunk

    o sctpAssocRemAddress and sctpAssocLocalAddressIP size upper limit
    restriction to 36, as TCP MIB

    o Change to Counter64 those counters which may wrap in less than an
    hour

    o Change sctpMaxAssoc variable to Integer32 since value û1 is allowed
    for dynamic maximum number of associations

    o Added a new column in the association table to give a pointer to
    the primary system level process which holds the association
    endpoint(sctpAssocPrimaryProcess)

    o Specify in the security section, which object should be handled
    carefully for security reasons
