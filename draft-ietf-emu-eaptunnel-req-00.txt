Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


1.  Introduction

   Running EAP methods within a TLS protected tunnel has been deployed
   in several different solutions.  EAP methods supporting this include
   PEAP, TTLS [I-D.funk-eap-ttls-v0] and EAP-FAST [RFC4851].  There have
   been various reasons for employing a protected tunnel for EAP
   processes.  They include protecting weak authentication exchanges,
   such as username and password.  In addition a protected tunnel can
   provide a means to provide peer identity protection and EAP method
   chaining.  Finally, systems have found it useful to transport
   additional types of data within the protected tunnel.

   This document describes the requirements for an EAP tunnel method as
   well as for a password protocol supporting legacy password databases
   within the tunnel method.


2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   Because this specification is an informational specification (not
   able to directly use [RFC2119]), the following capitalized words are
   used to express requirements language used in this specification.
   Use of each capitalized word within a sentence or phrase carries the
   following meaning during the EMU WG's method selection process:

      MUST - indicates an absolute requirement

      MUST NOT - indicates something absolutely prohibited

      SHOULD - indicates a strong recommendation of a desired result

      SHOULD NOT - indicates a strong recommendation against a result

      MAY - indicates a willingness to allow an optional outcome

   Lower case uses of "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and
   "MAY" carry their normal meaning and are not subject to these
   definitions.


3.  Use Cases

   To motivate and explain the requirements in this document, a
   representative set of use cases for the EAP tunnel method are
   supplied here.  The candidate tunnel method is expected to meet all
   of the use cases marked as MUST.

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


3.1.  Password Authentication

   Many legacy systems only support user authentication with passwords.
   Some of these systems require transport of the actual username and
   password to the authentication server.  This is true for systems
   where the authentication server does not have access to the cleartext
   password or a consistent transform of the cleartext password.
   Example of such systems are one time password (OTP) systems and other
   systems where the username and password are submitted to an external
   party for validation.  The tunnel method MUST meet this use case.
   However, it MUST NOT expose the username and password to untrusted
   parties and it MUST provide protection against man-in-the-middle and
   dictionary attacks.

   Since EAP authentication occurs before network access is granted the
   tunnel method SHOULD provide support for minimal password management
   tasks including password change, "new PIN mode", and "next token
   mode" required by some systems.

3.2.  Protect Weak EAP Methods

   Some existing EAP methods have vulnerabilities that could be
   eliminated or reduced by running them inside a protected tunnel.  For
   example, a method such as EAP-MD5 does not provide mutual
   authentication or protection from dictionary attacks.  In addition,
   tunneled EAP methods are subject to a specific form of man-in-the-
   middle attack described in [TUNNEL-MITM].

   The tunnel method MUST support protection of weak inner methods and
   protect against man-in-the-middle attacks associated with tunneled
   authentication.

3.3.  Chained EAP Methods

   Several circumstances are best addressed by using chained EAP
   methods.  For example, it may be desirable to authenticate the user
   and also authenticate the device that he or she is using.  However,
   chained EAP methods from different conversations can be re-directed
   into the same conversation by an attacker giving the authenticator
   the impression that both conversations terminate at the same end-
   point.  Cryptographic binding can be used to bind the results of key
   generating methods together or to an encompassing tunnel.

   The tunnel method MUST support chained EAP methods while including
   strong protection against attacks on the method chaining.

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


3.4.  Identity Protection

   When performing an EAP authentication, the peer may want to protect
   its identity, only disclosing its identity to a trusted backend
   authentication server.  This helps to maintain the privacy of the
   peer's identity.

   The tunnel method MUST support identity protection, ensuring that
   peer identity is not disclosed to the authenticator and any other
   intermediaries before the server that terminates the tunnel method.
   If an inner method also provides identity protection, this protection
   MUST extend all the way to the server that terminates that inner
   method.  Note that the peer may need to expose the realm portion of
   the EAP outer identity in the NAI [RFC4282] in a roaming scenario in
   order to reach the appropriate authentication server.

3.5.  Emergency Services Authentication

   When wireless VOIP service is provided, some regulations require any
   user to be able to gain access to the network to make an emergency
   telephone call.  To avoid eavesdropping on this call, it's best to
   negotiate link layer security as with any other authentication.

   Therefore, the tunnel method SHOULD allow anonymous peers or server-
   only authentication, but still derive keys that can be used for link
   layer security.  The tunnel method MAY also allow for the bypass of
   server authentication processing on the client.  Forgoing
   authentication increases the chance of man-in-the-middle and other
   types of attacks that can compromise the derived keys used for link
   layer security.

3.6.  Network Endpoint Assessment

   The Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) protocols and reference model
   described in [I-D.ietf-nea-requirements] provide a standard way to
   check the health ("posture") of a device at or after the time it
   connects to a network.  If the device does not comply with the
   network's requirements, it can be denied access to the network or
   granted limited access to remediate itself.  EAP is a convenient
   place for conducting an NEA exchange.

   The tunnel method SHOULD support carrying NEA protocols such as PB-
   TNC [I-D.ietf-nea-pb-tnc].  Depending on the specifics of the tunnel
   method, these protocols may be required to be carried in an EAP
   method.

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


3.7.  Credential Provisioning and Enrollment

   When a peer has authenticated with EAP, this is a convenient time to
   distribute credentials to that peer that may be used for later
   authentication exchanges.  For example, the authentication server can
   provide a private key or shared key to the peer that can be used by
   the peer to perform rapid re-authentication or roaming.  In addition
   there have been proposals to perform enrollment within EAP, such as
   [I-D.mahy-eap-enrollment].

   The tunnel method SHOULD support carrying credential distribution
   protocols.

3.8.  Resource Constrained Environments

   A growing number of "resource constrained" devices (e.g. printers and
   phones) are connecting to IP networks and those networks increasingly
   require EAP authentication to gain access.  Therefore, it is natural
   to expect that new EAP methods be designed to work as well as
   possible with these devices.

   For the purposes of this document, the phrase "resource constrained"
   means any combination of the following constraints: little processing
   power, small amounts of memory (both ROM and RAM), small amounts of
   long-term mutable storage (e.g. flash or hard drive) or none at all,
   and constrained power usage (perhaps due to small battery).

   The tunnel method SHOULD be designed so it can be configured to work
   with "resource constrained" devices, when possible.

3.9.  Client Authentication During Tunnel Establishment

   In cases where client authentication can be performed as part of the
   tunnel establishment it is efficient for the tunnel method to allow
   this.  The tunnel MUST be capable of providing client side
   authentication during tunnel establishment.

3.10.  Extensibility

   The tunnel method MUST provide extensibility so that additional types
   of data can be carried inside the tunnel in the future.  This removes
   the need to develop new tunneling methods for specific purposes.


4.  Requirements

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


4.1.  General Requirements

4.1.1.  RFC Compliance

   The tunnel method MUST include a Security Claims section with all
   security claims specified in Section 7.2 in RFC 3748 [RFC3748].  In
   addition, it MUST meet the requirement in Sections 2.1 and 7.4 of RFC
   3748 that tunnel methods MUST support protection against man-in-the-
   middle attacks.  Furthermore, all tunnel methods MUST support
   identity protection as specified in Section 7.3 in RFC 3748.

   The tunnel method MUST be unconditionally compliant with RFC 4017
   [RFC4017] (using the definition of "unconditionally compliant"
   contained in section 1.1 of RFC 4017).  This means that the method
   MUST satisfy all the MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT
   requirements in RFC 4017.

   The tunnel method MUST meet all the EAP method requirements contained
   in the EAP Key Management Framework draft [I-D.ietf-eap-keying] or
   its successor.  The tunnel method MUST include MSK and EMSK
   generation.  This will enable the tunnel method to properly fit into
   the EAP key management framework, maintaining all of the security
   properties and guarantees of that framework.

   The tunnel method MUST NOT be tied to any single cryptographic
   algorithm.  Instead, it MUST support run-time negotiation to select
   among an extensible set of cryptographic algorithms.  This
   "cryptographic algorithm agility" provides several advantages.  Most
   important, when a weakness in an algorithm is discovered or increased
   processing power overtakes an algorithm, users can easily transition
   to a new algorithm.  Also, users can choose the algorithm that best
   meets their needs.

   The tunnel method MUST meet requirements pertinent to EAP method
   contained in Section 3 of RFC 4962 [RFC4962].  This includes:
   cryptographic algorithm independence; strong, fresh session keys;
   replay detection; keying material confidentiality and integrity;
   confirm cipher suite selection; and uniquely named keys.  In
   addition, the tunnel method MUST support EAP channel bindings to
   enable a system based on EAP to meet the additional requirements in
   Section 3 of RFC 4962.

4.1.2.  Draw from Existing Work

   Several existing tunnel methods are already in widespread usage: EAP-
   FAST [RFC4851], EAP-TTLS [I-D.funk-eap-ttls-v0], and PEAP.
   Considerable experience has been gained from various deployments with
   these methods.  This experience SHOULD be considered when evaluating

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


   tunnel methods.  If one of these existing tunnel methods can meet the
   requirements contained in this specification then that method SHOULD
   be preferred over a new method.

   Even if minor modifications or extensions to an existing tunnel
   method are needed, this method SHOULD be preferred over a completely
   new method so that the advantage of accumulated deployment experience
   and security analysis can be gained.

4.2.  Tunnel Requirements

   Existing tunnel methods make use of TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] to
   provide the protected tunnel.  In general this has worked well so
   there is consensus to continue to use TLS as the basis for a tunnel
   method.

4.2.1.  TLS Requirements

   The tunnel based method MUST support TLS version 1.2
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] and SHOULD support TLS version 1.0
   [RFC2246] and version 1.1 [RFC4346] to enable the possibility of
   backwards compatibility with existing deployments.  The following
   section discusses requirements for TLS Tunnel Establishment.

4.2.1.1.  Cipher Suites

4.2.1.1.1.  Cipher Suite Negotiation

   Cipher suite negotiations always suffer from downgrading attacks when
   they are not secured by any kind of integrity protection.  A common
   practice is a post integrity check in which, as soon as available,
   the established keys (here the tunnel key) are used to derive
   integrity keys.  These integrity keys are then used by peer and
   authentication server to verify whether the cipher suite negotiation
   has been maliciously altered by another party.

   Integrity checks prevent downgrading attacks only if the derived
   integrity keys and the employed integrity algorithms cannot be broken
   in real-time.  See Section 6.1 or [KHLC07] for more information on
   this.  Hence, the tunnel method MUST provide integrity protected
   cipher suite negotiation with secure integrity algorithms and
   integrity keys.

   All versions of TLS meet these requirements as long as the cipher
   suites used provide strong authentication, key establishment and data
   integrity protection.

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


4.2.1.1.2.  Tunnel Data Protection Algorithms

   In order to prevent attacks on the cryptographic algorithms employed
   by inner authentication methods, a tunnel protocol's protection needs
   to provide a basic level of algorithm strength.  The tunnel method
   MUST provide at least one mandatory to implement cipher suite that
   provides the equivalent security of 128-bit AES for encryption and
   message authentication.  See [NIST SP 800-57] for a discussion of the
   relative strengths of common algorithms.

4.2.1.1.3.  Tunnel Authentication and Key Establishment

   A tunnel method MUST provide unidirectional authentication from
   authentication server to EAP peer or mutual authentication between
   authentication server and EAP peer.  The tunnel method MUST provide
   at least one mandatory to implement cipher suite that provides
   certificate based authentication of the server and provides optional
   certificate based authentication of the client.  Other types of
   authentication MAY be supported.

   At least one mandatory to implement cipher suite MUST meet the
   following requirements for secure key establishment along with the
   previous requirements for authentication and data protection
   algorithms:

   o  One-way key derivation, i.e., a compromised key leads to the
      compromise of all descendant keys but does not affect the security
      of any precedent key in the same branch of the key hierarchy.

   o  Cryptographically separated keys, i.e., a compromised key in one
      branch of the key hierarchy does not affect the security of keys
      in other branches.

   o  Cryptographically separated entities, i.e., keys held by different
      entities are cryptographically separate.  As a result, the
      compromise of a single peer does not compromise keying material
      held by any other peer within the system, including session keys
      and long-term keys.

   o  Identity binding, i.e., each derived key is bound to the EAP peer
      and authentication server by including their identifiers as input
      to the key derivation.

   o  Context binding, i.e., each derived key is bound to its context by
      including appropriate key labels in the input of the key
      derivation.

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


   o  Key lifetime, i.e., each key has a lifetime assigned that does not
      exceed the lifetime of any key higher in the key hierarchy.

   o  Mutual implicit key authentication, i.e., the keying material
      derived upon a successful key establishment execution is only
      known to the EAP peer and authentication server and is kept
      confidential.

   o  Key freshness, i.e.  EAP peer and EAP server are assured that the
      derived keys are fresh and the re-use of expired key material is
      prevented.  The freshness property is typically achieved by using
      one or more of the following techniques: nonces, sequence numbers,
      timestamps.


   The mandatory to implement cipher suites MUST NOT include "export
   strength" cipher suites, cipher suites providing mutually anonymous
   authentication or static Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.  NIST
   publication [NIST SP 800-52] can be consulted for a list of
   acceptable TLS v1.0 cipher suites and [NIST SP 800-108] for
   additional information on secure key derivation.

   In addition a tunnel method SHOULD provide cipher suites to meet the
   following additional recommendations for good key establishment
   algorithms:

   o  Key control , i.e., EAP peer and authentication server each
      contribute to the key computation of the tunnel key.  This
      property prevents that a single protocol participant controls the
      value of an established key.  In that way, protocol participants
      can ensure that generated keys are fresh and have good random
      properties.

   o  Key confirmation, i.e., one protocol participant is assured that
      another participant actually possesses a particular secret key.
      In the case of mutual key confirmation both the EAP peer and the
      authentication server are assured that they possess the same key.
      Key confirmation is commonly achieved by using one of the derived
      keys to generate a message authentication code.  Mutual key
      confirmation combined with mutual implicit key authentication
      leads to mutual explicit key authentication.

   o  Forward secrecy (FS), i.e., if a long-term secret key is
      compromised, it does not compromise keys that have been
      established in previous EAP executions.  This property is
      typically achieved by executing an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key
      establishment.

4.2.1.2.  Tunnel Replay Protection

   In order to prevent replay attacks on a tunnel protocol, the message
   authentication MUST be generated using a time-variant input such as
   timestamps, sequence numbers, nonces, or a combination of these so
   that any re-use of the authentication data can be detected as
   invalid.  TLS makes use of an 8 byte sequence number to protect
   against replay.

4.2.1.3.  TLS Extensions

   In order to meet the requirements in this document TLS extensions MAY
   be used.  For example, TLS extensions may be useful in providing
   certificate revocation information via the TLS OCSP extension (thus
   meeting the requirement in Section 4.5.1.3).

4.2.1.4.  Peer Identity Privacy

   A tunnel protocol MUST support peer privacy.  This requires that the
   username is not transmitted in the clear and, if applicable, the peer
   certificate is sent confidentially (i.e. encrypted).

4.2.1.5.  Session Resumption

   The tunnel method MUST support TLS session resumption as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis].  The tunnel method MAY support other
   methods of session resumption such as those defined in [RFC5077].

4.2.2.  Fragmentation

   Tunnel establishment sometimes requires the exchange of information
   that exceeds what can be carried in a single EAP message.  In
   addition information carried within the tunnel may also exceed this
   limit.  Therefore a tunnel method MUST support fragmentation and
   reassembly.

4.2.3.  EAP Header Protection

   A tunnel method SHOULD provide protection of the outer EAP header
   information when possible to make sure the outer EAP header is not
   modified by the intermediaries.

4.3.  Tunnel Payload Requirements

   This section describes the payload requirements inside the tunnel.
   These requirements frequently express features that a candidate
   protocol must be capable of offering so that a deployer can decide
   whether to make use of that feature.  This section does not state

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


   requirements about what features of each protocol must be used during
   a deployment.

4.3.1.  Extensible Attribute Types

   The payload MUST be extensible.  Some standard payload attribute
   types will be defined to meet known requirements listed below, such
   as password authentication, inner EAP method, vendor specific
   attributes, and result indication.  Additional payload attributes MAY
   be defined in the future to support additional features and data
   types.

4.3.2.  Request/Challenge Response Operation

   The payload MUST support request and response type of half-duplex
   operation typical of EAP.  Multiple attributes may be sent in a
   single payload.  The payload MAY support carrying on multiple
   authentications in a single payload packet.

4.3.3.  Mandatory and Optional Attributes

   The payload MUST support marking of mandatory and optional
   attributes, as well as an attribute used for rejecting mandatory
   attributes.  Mandatory attributes are attributes sent by the
   requester that the responder is expected to understand and MUST
   respond to.  If the responder does not understand or support one of
   the mandatory attributes in the request, it MUST ignore the rest of
   the attributes and send a NAK attribute to decline the request.  The
   NAK attribute MUST support inclusion of which mandatory attribute is
   not supported.  The optional attributes are attributes that are not
   mandatory to support and respond to.  If the responder does not
   understand or support the optional attributes, it can ignore these
   attributes.

4.3.4.  Vendor Specific Support

   The payload MUST support communication of an extensible set of
   vendor-specific attributes.  These attributes will be segmented into
   uniquely identified vendor specific name spaces.  They can be used
   for experiments or vendor specific features.

4.3.5.  Result Indication

   The payload MUST support result indication and its acknowledgement,
   so both the EAP peer and server will end up with a synchronized
   state.  The result indication is needed after each chained inner
   authentication method and at the end of the authentication, so
   separate result indication for intermediate and final result MUST be

   supported.

4.3.6.  Internationalization of Display Strings

   The payload MAY provide a standard attribute format that supports
   international strings.  This attribute format MUST support encoding
   strings in UTF-8 [RFC3629] format.  Any strings sent by the server
   intended for display to the user MUST be sent in UTF-8 format and
   SHOULD be able to be marked with language information and adapted to
   the user's language preference.

4.4.  EAP Channel Binding Requirements

   The so-called "lying NAS" problem is a well-documented problem with
   the current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) architecture
   [RFC3748] when used with pass-through authenticators.  Here, a
   Network Access Server (NAS), or pass-through authenticator, may
   authenticate to the backend AAA infrastructure using one set of
   credentials, while representing contrary information to EAP peers.

   Such attacks can be prevented by so-called channel bindings
   [I-D.clancy-emu-chbind], in which key channel binding characteristics
   are transported from the peer to the server, allowing the server to
   verify whether the authenticator has advertised valid information to
   the peer.  The server can also respond back with additional
   information that could be useful for the peer to decide whether or
   not to continue its session with the serving authenticator.

   The tunnel method MUST be capable of supporting EAP channel bindings
   described above.

4.5.  Requirements Associated with Carrying Username and Passwords

   This section describes the requirements associated with tunneled
   password authentication.  The password authentication mentioned here
   refers to user or machine authentication using a legacy password
   database, such as LDAP, OTP, etc.  These legacy user databases
   typically require the password in its original text form in order to
   authenticate the peer, hence they require the peer to send the clear
   text user name and password to the EAP server.

4.5.1.  Security

   Due to the fact that the EAP peer needs to send clear text password
   to the EAP server to authenticate to the legacy user database, the
   security measures in the following sections MUST be met.

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


4.5.1.1.  Confidentiality and Integrity

   The clear text password exchange MUST be integrity and
   confidentiality protected.  As long as the password exchange occurs
   inside an authenticated and encrypted tunnel, this requirement is
   met.

4.5.1.2.  Authentication of Server

   The EAP server MUST be authenticated before the peer can send the
   clear text user name and password to the server.

4.5.1.3.  Server Credential Revocation Checking

   In some cases, the EAP peer needs to present its password to the
   server before it has network access to check the revocation status of
   the server's credentials.  Therefore, the tunnel method MUST support
   mechanisms to check the revocation status of a credential.  The
   tunnel method SHOULD make use of Online Certificate Status Protocol
   (OCSP) [RFC2560] or Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol
   (SCVP) [RFC5055] to obtain the revocation status of the EAP server
   certificate.

4.5.2.  Internationalization

   The password authentication exchange MUST support user names and
   passwords in international languages.  It MUST support encoding of
   user name and password strings in UTF-8 [RFC3629] format.  Any
   strings sent by the server during the password exchange and intended
   for display to the user MUST be sent in UTF-8 format and SHOULD be
   able to be marked with language information and adapted to the user's
   language preference.

4.5.3.  Meta-data

   The password authentication exchange MUST support additional
   associated meta-data which can be used to indicate whether the
   authentication is for a user or a machine.  This allows the EAP
   server and peer to request and negotiate authentication specifically
   for a user or machine.  This is useful in the case of multiple inner
   authentications where the user and machine both need to be
   authenticated.

4.5.4.  Password Change

   The password authentication exchange MUST support password change, as
   well as other multiple round trips exchanges like new pin mode and
   next token mode for OTP database.

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


4.6.  Requirements Associated with Carrying EAP Methods

4.6.1.  Method Negotiation

   The tunnel method MUST support the protected negotiation of the inner
   EAP method.  It MUST NOT allow the inner EAP method negotiation to be
   downgraded or manipulated by intermediaries.

4.6.2.  Chained Methods

   The tunnel method MUST support the chaining of multiple EAP methods.
   The tunnel method MUST allow for the communication of intermediate
   result and verification of compound binding between executed inner
   methods when chained methods are employed.

4.6.3.  Cryptographic Binding with TLS Tunnel

   The tunnel method MUST provide a mechanism to bind the tunnel
   protocol and the inner EAP method.  This property is referred to as
   cryptographic binding.  Without such bindings attacks are feasible on
   tunnel methods [TUNNEL-MITM] and chained methods.

   Cryptographic bindings are typically achieved by securely mixing the
   established keying material (say tunnel key TK) from the tunnel
   protocol with the established keying material (say method key MK)
   from the inner authentication method(s) in order to derive fresh
   keying material.  If chained EAP methods are executed in the tunnel,
   all derived inner keys are combined to one method key MK.  The keying
   material derived from mixing tunnel and method keys is also referred
   to as compound key CTK.  In particular, CTK is used to derive MSK,
   EMSK and other transient keys TEK, such as transient encryption keys
   and integrity protection keys.  The key hierarchy for tunnel methods
   executions that derive compound keys for the purpose of cryptographic
   binding is depicted in Figure 1.

                          Figure 1: Compound Keys

   For every key deriving inner EAP method that completes successfully
   within the tunnel cryptographic binding MUST be performed similar to
   the following:

   o  compute a compound key CTK using the keying material from tunnel
      protocol and all tunneled inner authentication method(s) as inputs

   o  use compound key CTK to derive transient keys for use in a
      cryptographic protocol that verifies the integrity of the tunnel
      and the inner authentication method.

   Furthermore, the compound key CTK and all keys derived from it SHOULD
   be derived in accordance to the guidelines for key derivations and
   key hierarchies as specified in Section 4.2.1.1.3.  In particular,
   all derived keys MUST have a lifetime assigned that does not exceed
   the lifetime of any key higher in the key hierarchy, and MUST prevent
   domino effects.

4.6.4.  Peer Initiated

   The tunnel method SHOULD allow for the peer to initiate an inner EAP
   authentication in order to meet its policy requirements for
   authenticating the server.

4.6.5.  Method Meta-data

   The tunnel method MUST allow for the communication of additional data
   associated with an EAP method.  This can be used to indicate whether
   the authentication is for a user or a machine.  This allows the EAP

   server and peer to request and negotiate authentication specifically
   for a user or machine.  This is useful in the case of multiple inner
   EAP authentications where the user and machine both need to be
   authenticated.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.


6.  Security Considerations

   A tunnel method is often deployed to provide mutual authentication
   between EAP Peer and EAP Server and to generate strong key material
   for use in protecting lower layer protocols.  In addition the tunnel
   is used to protect the communication of additional data, including
   peer identity between the EAP Peer and EAP Server from disclosure to
   or modification by an attacker.  These sections cover considerations
   that affect the ability for a method to achieve these goals.

6.1.  Ciphersuite Selection

   TLS supports a wide variety of cipher suites providing a variety of
   security properties.  The selection of strong cipher suites is
   critical to the security of the tunnel method.  Selection of a cipher
   suite with weak or no authentication, such as an anonymous Diffie-
   Hellman based cipher suite will greatly increase the risk of system
   compromise.  Since a tunnel method uses the TLS tunnel to transport
   data, the selection of a ciphersuite with weak data encryption and
   integrity algorithms will also increase the vulnerability of the
   method to attacks.

   A tunnel protocol is prone to downgrading attacks if the tunnel
   protocol supports any key establishment algorithm that can be broken
   on-line.  In a successful downgrading attack, an adversary breaks the
   selected "weak" key establishment algorithm and optionally the "weak"
   authentication algorithm without being detected.  Here, "weak" refers
   to a key establishment algorithm that can be broken in real-time, and
   an authentication scheme that can be broken off-line, respectively.
   See [KHLC07] for more details.  The requirements in this document
   disapprove the use of key establishment algorithms that can be broken
   on-line.

   Mutually anonymous tunnel protocols are prone to man-in-the-middle
   attacks described in [KHLC07].  During such an attack, an adversary
   establishes a tunnel with each the peer and the authentication
   server, while peer and server believe that they established a tunnel



Hoeper, et al.          Expires December 27, 2008              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft       EAP Tunnel Method Requirements            June 2008


   with each other.  Once both tunnels have been established, the
   adversary can eavesdrop on all communications within the tunnels,
   i.e. the execution of the inner authentication method(s).
   Consequently, the adversary can eavesdrop on the identifiers that are
   exchanged as part of the EAP method and thus, the privacy of peer
   and/or authentication server is compromised along with any other data
   transmitted within the tunnels.

6.2.  Tunneled Authentication

   In many cases a tunnel method provides mutual authentication by
   authenticating the server during tunnel establishment and
   authenticating the peer within the tunnel using an EAP method.  As
   described in [TUNNEL-MITM], this mode of operation can allow a man-
   in-the-middle to authenticate to the server as the peer by tunneling
   the inner EAP protocol messages to and from a peer executing the
   method outside a tunnel or with an untrustworthy server.
   Cryptographic binding between the established keying material from
   the inner authentication method(s) and the tunnel protocol verifies
   that the endpoints of the tunnel and the inner authentication
   method(s) are the same. this can thwart the attack if the inner
   method derived keys of sufficient strength that they cannot be broken
   in real-time.

   In cases where the inner authentication method does not generate any
   or only weak key material care must be taken to ensure that the peer
   does not execute the inner method with the same credentials outside a
   protective tunnel or with an untrustworthy server.

6.3.  Outer EAP Method Header

   There are several existing EAP methods which use a similar packet
   format to EAP-TLS.  Often for the initial portions of the exchange
   the execution of the method is identical except for the method ID.
   Protection of the outer EAP header helps to avoid vulnerabilities
   that may arise when an attacker attempts to modify packets to make
   one EAP message look like one from a different method.
