      Additional XML Security Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
             <draft-eastlake-rfc6931bis-xmlsec-uris-01.txt>



Abstract

   This document updates and corrects the IANA registry for the list of
   URIs intended for use with XML digital signatures, encryption,
   canonicalization, and key management.  These URIs identify algorithms
   and types of information.  This document corrrects three errata
   against and obsoletes RFC 6931.

   The intent is to keep this draft alive while it accumulates updates
   until it seems reasonable to publish the next version.

INTERNET-DRAFT                              Additional XML Security URIs


1. Introduction

   XML digital signatures, canonicalization, and encryption have been
   standardized by the W3C and by the joint IETF/W3C XMLDSIG working
   group [W3C].  All of these are now W3C Recommendations and some are
   also RFCs.  They are available as follows:

      RFC
      Status            W3C REC      Topic
      -----------       -------      -----

      [RFC3275]         [XMLDSIG10]  XML Digital Signatures
      Draft Standard

      [RFC3076]         [CANON10]    Canonical XML
      Informational

      - - - - - -       [XMLENC10]   XML Encryption 1.0

      [RFC3741]         [XCANON]     Exclusive XML Canonicalization 1.0
      Informational

   All of these documents and recommendations use URIs [RFC3986] to
   identify algorithms and keying information types.  The W3C has
   subsequently produced updated XML Signature 1.1 [XMLDSIG11],
   Canonical XML 1.1 [CANON11], and XML Encryption 1.1 [XMLENC11]
   versions, as well as a new XML Signature Properties specification
   [XMLDSIG-PROP].

   All camel-case element names herein, such as DigestValue, are from
   these documents.

   This document is an updated convenient reference list of URIs and
   corresponding algorithms in which there is expressed interest.  This
   document fixes Errata [Err3597], [Err3965], [Err4004] against and
   obsoletes [RFC6931].

   All of the URIs appear in the indexes in Section 4.  Only the URIs
   that were added by [RFC4051], [RFC6931], or this document have a
   subsection in Section 2 or 3, with the exception of Minimal
   Canonicalization (Section 2.4).  For example, use of SHA-256 is
   defined in [XMLENC11] and hence there is no subsection on that
   algorithm here, but its URI is included in the indexes in Section 4.

   Specification in this document of the URI representing an algorithm
   does not imply endorsement of the algorithm for any particular
   purpose.  A protocol specification, which this is not, generally
   gives algorithm and implementation requirements for the protocol.
   Security considerations for algorithms are constantly evolving, as
   documented elsewhere.  This specification simply provides some URIs

INTERNET-DRAFT                              Additional XML Security URIs


   and relevant formatting for when those URIs are used.

   Note that progressing XML Digital Signature [RFC3275] along the
   Standards Track required removal of any algorithms from the original
   version [RFC3075] for which there was not demonstrated
   interoperability.  This required removal of the Minimal
   Canonicalization algorithm, in which there appears to be continued
   interest.  The URI for Minimal Canonicalization was included in
   [RFC4051] and [RFC6931] and is included here.



1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document is not intended to change the algorithm implementation
   requirements of any IETF or W3C document. Use of [RFC2119]
   terminology is intended to be only such as is already stated or
   implied by other authoritative documents.

2. Algorithms

   The URI [RFC3986] that was dropped from the XML Digital Signature
   standard due to the transition from Proposed Standard to Draft
   Standard [RFC3275] is included in Section 2.4 below with its original

        http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#

   prefix so as to avoid changing the XMLDSIG standard's namespace.

   Additional algorithms in [RFC4051] were given URIs that start with

        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#

   while further algorithms added in this document are given URIs that
   start with

        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#

   In addition, for ease of reference, this document includes in the
   indexes in Section 4 many cryptographic algorithm URIs from several
   XML security documents using the namespaces with which they are
   defined in those documents. For example, 2000/09/xmldsig# for some
   URIs specified in [RFC3275] and 2001/04/xmlenc# for some URIs
   specified in [XMLENC10].

   See also [XMLSECXREF].



2.1 DigestMethod (Hash) Algorithms

   These algorithms are usable wherever a DigestMethod element occurs.



2.1.1 MD5

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#md5

   The MD5 algorithm [RFC1321] takes no explicit parameters. An example
   of an MD5 DigestAlgorithm element is:

   <DigestAlgorithm
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#md5"/>

   An MD5 digest is a 128-bit string. The content of the DigestValue
   element SHALL be the base64 [RFC2045] encoding of this bit string
   viewed as a 16-octet octet stream. See [RFC6151] for MD5 security

   considerations.



2.1.2 SHA-224

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha224

   The SHA-224 algorithm [FIPS180-4] [RFC6234] takes no explicit
   parameters.  An example of a SHA-224 DigestAlgorithm element is:

   <DigestAlgorithm
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha224" />

   A SHA-224 digest is a 224-bit string. The content of the DigestValue
   element SHALL be the base64 [RFC2045] encoding of this string viewed
   as a 28-octet stream.



2.1.3 SHA-384

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha384

   The SHA-384 algorithm [FIPS180-4] takes no explicit parameters.  An
   example of a SHA-384 DigestAlgorithm element is:

   <DigestAlgorithm
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha384" />

   A SHA-384 digest is a 384-bit string. The content of the DigestValue
   element SHALL be the base64 [RFC2045] encoding of this string viewed
   as a 48-octet stream.



2.1.4 Whirlpool

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#whirlpool

   The Whirlpool algorithm [10118-3] takes no explicit parameters.  A
   Whirlpool digest is a 512-bit string.  The content of the DigestValue
   element SHALL be the base64 [RFC2045] encoding of this string viewed
   as a 64-octet stream.

2.1.5 New SHA Functions

   Identifiers:
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-224
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-256
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-384
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-512

   NIST has recently completed a hash function competition for an
   alternative to the SHA family.  The Keccak-f[1600] algorithm was
   selected [Keccak] [SHA-3].  This hash function is commonly referred
   to as "SHA-3", and this section is a space holder and reservation of
   URIs for future information on Keccak use in XML security.

   A SHA-3 224, 256, 384, and 512 digest is a 224-, 256-, 384-, and
   512-bit string, respectively.  The content of the DigestValue element
   SHALL be the base64 [RFC2045] encoding of this string viewed as a
   28-, 32-, 48-, and 64-octet stream, respectively.



2.2 SignatureMethod MAC Algorithms

   This section covers SignatureMethod MAC (Message Authentication Code)
   Algorithms.

   Note: Some text in this section is duplicated from [RFC3275] for the
   convenience of the reader. RFC 3275 is normative in case of conflict.



2.2.1 HMAC-MD5

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-md5

   The HMAC algorithm [RFC2104] takes the truncation length in bits as a
   parameter; if the parameter is not specified, then all the bits of
   the hash are output. An example of an HMAC-MD5 SignatureMethod
   element is as follows:

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-md5">
      <HMACOutputLength>112</HMACOutputLength>
   </SignatureMethod>

   The output of the HMAC algorithm is ultimately the output (possibly
   truncated) of the chosen digest algorithm. This value SHALL be base64
   [RFC2045] encoded in the same straightforward fashion as the output
   of the digest algorithms. Example: the SignatureValue element for the

        </simpleType>

   DTD:

   The Schema Definition and DTD immediately above are copied from
   [RFC3275].

2.2.2 HMAC SHA Variations

   Identifiers:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha224
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha256

        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha512

   SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 [FIPS180-4] [RFC6234] can also
   be used in HMAC as described in Section 2.2.1 above for HMAC-MD5.



2.2.3 HMAC-RIPEMD160

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-ripemd160

   RIPEMD-160 [10118-3] can also be used in HMAC as described in Section
   2.2.1 above for HMAC-MD5.

2.3 SignatureMethod Public Key Signature Algorithms

   These algorithms are distinguished from those in Section 2.2 above in
   that they use public key methods. That is to say, the verification
   key is different from and not feasibly derivable from the signing
   key.



2.3.1 RSA-MD5

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-md5

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm described in
   [RFC3447]. An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-md5" />

   The SignatureValue content for an RSA-MD5 signature is the base64
   [RFC2045] encoding of the octet string computed as per [RFC3447],
   Section 8.2.1, signature generation for the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5
   signature scheme. As specified in the EMSA-PKCS1-V1_5-ENCODE function
   in [RFC3447], Section 9.2, the value input to the signature function
   MUST contain a pre-pended algorithm object identifier for the hash
   function, but the availability of an ASN.1 parser and recognition of
   OIDs is not required of a signature verifier. The PKCS#1 v1.5
   representation appears as:

        CRYPT (PAD (ASN.1 (OID, DIGEST (data))))

   Note that the padded ASN.1 will be of the following form:

        01 | FF* | 00 | prefix | hash

   Vertical bar ("|") represents concatenation. "01", "FF", and "00" are
   fixed octets of the corresponding hexadecimal value, and the asterisk
   ("*") after "FF" indicates repetition. "hash" is the MD5 digest of
   the data. "prefix" is the ASN.1 BER MD5 algorithm designator prefix
   required in PKCS #1 [RFC3447], that is,

        hex 30 20 30 0c 06 08 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 02 05 05 00 04 10

   This prefix is included to make it easier to use standard
   cryptographic libraries. The FF octet MUST be repeated enough times
   that the value of the quantity being CRYPTed is exactly one octet
   shorter than the RSA modulus.

   See [RFC6151] for MD5 security considerations.

2.3.2 RSA-SHA256

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC3447] as described
   in Section 2.3.1, but with the ASN.1 BER SHA-256 algorithm designator
   prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256" />



2.3.3 RSA-SHA384

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha384

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC3447] as described
   in Section 2.3.1, but with the ASN.1 BER SHA-384 algorithm designator
   prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha384" />

   Because it takes about the same effort to calculate a SHA-384 message
   digest as it does a SHA-512 message digest, it is suggested that RSA-
   SHA512 be used in preference to RSA-SHA384 where possible.



2.3.4 RSA-SHA512

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha512

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC3447] as described
   in Section 2.3.1, but with the ASN.1 BER SHA-512 algorithm designator
   prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha512" />

   in Section 2.3.1, but with the ASN.1 BER RIPEMD160 algorithm

   The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) [FIPS180-4] is
   the elliptic curve analogue of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
   signature method, i.e., the Digital Signature Standard (DSS). It
   takes no explicit parameters. For detailed specifications of how to
   use it with SHA hash functions and XML Digital Signature, please see
   [X9.62] and [RFC4050].  The #ecdsa-ripemd160 and #ecdsa-whirlpool
   fragments in the new namespace identifies a signature method
   processed in the same way as specified by the #ecdsa-sha1 fragment of
   this namespace, with the exception that RIPEMD160 or Whirlpool is
   used instead of SHA-1.

   The output of the ECDSA algorithm consists of a pair of integers
   usually referred by the pair (r, s).  The signature value consists of
   the base64 encoding of the concatenation of two octet streams that
   respectively result from the octet encoding of the values r and s in
   that order.  Conversion from integer to octet-stream must be done
   according to the I2OSP operation defined in the [RFC3447]
   specification with the l parameter equal to the size of the base
   point order of the curve in bytes (e.g., 32 for the P-256 curve and
   66 for the P-521 curve [FIPS186-3]).

   For an introduction to elliptic curve cryptographic algorithms, see
   [RFC6090] and note the errata (Errata ID 2773-2777).

2.3.7 ESIGN-SHA*

        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#esign-sha512

   The ESIGN algorithm specified in [IEEEP1363a] is a signature scheme
   based on the integer factorization problem. It is much faster than
   previous digital signature schemes, so ESIGN can be implemented on
   smart cards without special co-processors.

   An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod

2.3.8 RSA-Whirlpool

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#rsa-whirlpool

   As in the definition of the RSA-SHA1 algorithm in [XMLDSIG11], the
   designator "RSA" means the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm as defined in
   [RFC3447].  When identified through the #rsa-whirlpool fragment
   identifier, Whirlpool is used as the hash algorithm instead.  Use of
   the ASN.1 BER Whirlpool algorithm designator is implied. That
   designator is
        hex 30 4e 30 0a 06 06 28 cf 06 03 00 37 05 00 04 40
   as an explicit octet sequence. This corresponds to OID
   1.0.10118.3.0.55 defined in [10118-3].

   These identifiers imply the PKCS#1 EMSA-PSS encoding algorithm
   [RFC3447].  The RSASSA-PSS algorithm takes the digest method (hash
   function), a mask generation function, the salt length in bytes
   (SaltLength), and the trailer field as explicit parameters.

   Algorithm identifiers for hash functions specified in XML encryption
   [XMLENC11] [XMLDSIG11] and in Section 2.1 are considered to be valid
   algorithm identifiers for hash functions.  According to [RFC3447],
   the default value for the digest function is SHA-1, but due to the
   discovered weakness of SHA-1 [RFC6194], it is recommended that
   SHA-256 or a stronger hash function be used. Notwithstanding
   [RFC3447], SHA-256 is the default to be used with these
   SignatureMethod identifiers if no hash function has been specified.

   The default salt length for these SignatureMethod identifiers if the
   SaltLength is not specified SHALL be the number of octets in the hash
   value of the digest method, as recommended in [RFC4055]. In a
   parameterized RSASSA-PSS signature the ds:DigestMethod and the
   SaltLength parameters usually appear. If they do not, the defaults
   make this equivalent to http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-
   more#sha256-rsa-MGF1 (see Section 2.3.10). The TrailerField defaults
   to 1 (0xBC) when omitted.

2.3.10 RSASSA-PSS without Parameters

   [RFC3447] currently specifies only one mask generation function MGF1
   based on a hash function.  Although [RFC3447] allows for
   parameterization, the default is to use the same hash function as the
   digest method function.  Only this default approach is supported by
   this section; therefore, the definition of a mask generation function
   type is not needed yet.  The same applies to the trailer field. There
   is only one value (0xBC) specified in [RFC3447].  Hence, this default
   parameter must be used for signature generation. The default salt
   length is the length of the hash function.

2.3.11 RSA-SHA224

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha224

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC3447] as described
   in Section 2.3.1 but with the ASN.1 BER SHA-224 algorithm designator


D. Eastlake 3rd                                                [Page 16]

   prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha224" />

   Because it takes about the same effort to calculate a SHA-224 message
   digest as it does a SHA-256 message digest, it is suggested that RSA-
   SHA256 be used in preference to RSA-SHA224 where possible.

   See also Appendix B concerning an erroneous version of this URI that
   appeared in [RFC6931].



2.4 Minimal Canonicalization

   Thus far, two independent interoperable implementations of Minimal
   Canonicalization have not been announced.  Therefore, when XML
   Digital Signature was advanced along the Standards Track from
   [RFC3075] to [RFC3275], Minimal Canonicalization was dropped.
   However, there is still interest.  For its definition, see Section
   6.5.1 of [RFC3075].

   For reference, its identifier remains:
        http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#minimal



2.5 Transform Algorithms

   Note that all CanonicalizationMethod algorithms can also be used as
   Transform algorithms.



2.5.1 XPointer

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#xptr

   This transform algorithm takes an [XPointer] as an explicit
   parameter.  An example of use is:

   Schema Definition:

        <element name="XPointer" type="string"/>

   DTD:

        <!ELEMENT XPointer (#PCDATA) >

   Input to this transform is an octet stream (which is then parsed into
   XML).

   Output from this transform is a node set; the results of the XPointer
   are processed as defined in the XMLDSIG specification [RFC3275] for a
   same-document XPointer.



2.6 EncryptionMethod Algorithms

   This subsection gives identifiers and information for several
   EncryptionMethod Algorithms.



2.6.1 ARCFOUR Encryption Algorithm

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#arcfour

   ARCFOUR is a fast, simple stream encryption algorithm that is
   compatible with RSA Security's RC4 algorithm [RC4]. An example
   EncryptionMethod element using ARCFOUR is

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#arcfour">
      <KeySize>40</KeySize>
   </EncryptionMethod>

   Note that Arcfour makes use of the generic KeySize parameter
   specified and defined in [XMLENC11].

2.6.2 Camellia Block Encryption

   Identifiers:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia128-cbc
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia192-cbc
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia256-cbc

   Camellia is a block cipher with the same interface as the AES
   [Camellia] [RFC3713]; it has a 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and
   256-bit key sizes. In XML Encryption Camellia is used in the same way
   as the AES: It is used in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with a
   128-bit initialization vector (IV). The resulting cipher text is
   prefixed by the IV. If included in XML output, it is then base64
   encoded. An example Camellia EncryptionMethod is as follows:

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm=
      "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia128-cbc"
   />



2.6.3 Camellia Key Wrap

   Identifiers:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia128
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia192
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia256

   Camellia [Camellia] [RFC3713] key wrap is identical to the AES key
   wrap algorithm [RFC3394] specified in the XML Encryption standard
   with "AES" replaced by "Camellia". As with AES key wrap, the check
   value is 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6.

   The algorithm is the same whatever the size of the Camellia key used
   in wrapping, called the "key encrypting key" or "KEK". If Camellia is
   supported, it is particularly suggested that wrapping 128-bit keys
   with a 128-bit KEK and wrapping 256-bit keys with a 256-bit KEK be
   supported.

   An example of use is:

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm=
      "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia128"
   />

2.6.4 PSEC-KEM

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#psec-kem

   The PSEC-KEM algorithm, specified in [18033-2], is a key
   encapsulation mechanism using elliptic curve encryption.

   An example of use is:

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#psec-kem">
      <ECParameters>
         <Version>version</Version>

         <Base>base</Base>
         <Order>order</Order>
         <Cofactor>cofactor</Cofactor>
      </ECParameters>
   </EncryptionMethod>

   See [18033-2] for information on the parameters above.



2.6.5 SEED Block Encryption

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#seed128-cbc

   SEED [RFC4269] is a 128-bit block size with 128-bit key sizes. In XML
   Encryption, SEED can be used in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
   with a 128-bit initialization vector (IV). The resulting cipher text
   is prefixed by the IV. If included in XML output, it is then base64
   encoded.

   An example SEED EncryptionMethod is as follows:

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#seed128-cbc" />



2.6.6 SEED Key Wrap

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#kw-seed128

   Key wrapping with SEED is identical to Section 2.2.1 of [RFC3394]

   with "AES" replaced by "SEED". The algorithm is specified in
   [RFC4010].  The implementation of SEED is optional. The default
   initial value is 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6.

   An example of use is:

3. KeyInfo

   In Section 3.1 below a new KeyInfo element child is specified, while
   in Section 3.2 additional KeyInfo Type values for use in
   RetrievalMethod are specified.



3.1 PKCS #7 Bag of Certificates and CRLs

   A PKCS #7 [RFC2315] "signedData" can also be used as a bag of
   certificates and/or certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  The
   PKCS7signedData element is defined to accommodate such structures
   within KeyInfo.  The binary PKCS #7 structure is base64 [RFC2045]
   encoded.  Any signer information present is ignored.  The following
   is a example [RFC3092], eliding the base64 data:

   <foo:PKCS7signedData
      xmlns:foo="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more">
      ...
   </foo:PKCS7signedData>



3.2 Additional RetrievalMethod Type Values

   The Type attribute of RetrievalMethod is an optional identifier for
   the type of data to be retrieved. The result of dereferencing a
   RetrievalMethod reference for all KeyInfo types with an XML structure
   is an XML element or document with that element as the root. The
   various "raw" key information types return a binary value. Thus, they
   require a Type attribute because they are not unambiguously parsable.

5. Allocation Considerations

   W3C and IANA allocation considerations are given below.



5.1 W3C Allocation Considerations

   As it is easy for people to construct their own unique URIs [RFC3986]
   and, if appropriate, to obtain a URI from the W3C, it is not intended
   that any additional "http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#" URIs be
   created beyond those enumerated in this RFC.  (W3C Namespace
   stability rules prohibit the creation of new URIs under
   "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#" and URIs under
   "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#" were frozen with the
   publication of [RFC4051].)

   An "xmldsig-more" URI does not imply any official W3C or IETF status
   for these algorithms or identifiers nor does it imply that they are
   only useful in digital signatures.  Currently, dereferencing such
   URIs may or may not produce a temporary placeholder document.
   Permission to use these URI prefixes has been given by the W3C.



5.2 IANA Considerations

   IANA has established a registry entitled "XML Security URIs".  The
   initial contents correspond to Section 4.2 of this document with each
   section number in the "Sec/Doc" column augmented with a reference to
   this RFC (for example, "2.6.4" means "[RFC6931], Section 2.6.4").

   New entries, including new Types, will be added based on Expert
   Review [RFC5226].  Criterion for inclusion are (1) documentation
   sufficient for interoperability of the algorithm or data type and the
   XML syntax for its representation and use and (2) sufficient
   importance as normally indicated by inclusion in (2a) an approved W3C
   Note, Proposed Recommendation, or Recommendation or (2b) an approved
   IETF Standards Track document.  Typically, the registry will
   reference a W3C or IETF document specifying such XML syntax; that
   document will either contain a more abstract description of the
   algorithm or data type or reference another document with a more
   abstract description.

6. Security Considerations

   This RFC is concerned with documenting the URIs that designate
   algorithms and some data types used in connection with XML security.
   The security considerations vary widely with the particular
   algorithms, and the general security considerations for XML security
   are outside of the scope of this document but appear in [XMLDSIG11],
   [XMLENC11], [CANON10], [CANON11], and [GENERIC].

   [RFC6151] should be consulted before considering the use of MD5 as a
   DigestMethod or RSA-MD5 as a SignatureMethod.

   See [RFC6194] for SHA-1 security considerations and [RFC6151] for MD5
   security considerations.

   Additional security considerations are given in connection with the
   description of some algorithms in the body of this document.

   Implementers should be aware that cryptographic algorithms become
   weaker with time.  As new cryptoanalysis techniques are developed and
   computing performance improves, the work factor to break a particular
   cryptographic algorithm will reduce.  Therefore, cryptographic
   implementations should be modular, allowing new algorithms to be
   readily inserted.  That is, implementers should be prepared for the
   set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to change over time.

Appendix A: Changes from RFC 6931

   The following changes have been made in RFC 6931 to produce this
   document.

    1. Delete Appendix on Changes from RFC 4051, since they were already
       included in RFC 6931, and remove refeence to RFC 4051 and to the
       on Errata against RFC 4051.

    2. Fix three errata as follows: [Err3597], [Err3965], and [Err4004].
       In cases where [RFC6931] had an erroneous URI, it is still
       included in the indicies and it is stated that implementations
       SHOULD only generate the correct URI but SHOULD understand both
       the correct and erroneous URI.

    3. Minor editorial changes.

Appendix B: Bad URIs

   [RFC6931] included two bad URIs as shown below. "{Bad}" in the
   indexes (Section 4.1 and 4.1) indicates such a Bad value.
   Implementations SHOULD only generate the correct URI but SHOULD
   understand both the correct and erroneous URI.

   2006/12/xmlc12n11#
       Appears in the indicies (Section 4.1 and 4.2] of [RFC6931] when
       it should be "2006/12/xmlc14n11#" (i.e., "12" should have been
       "14"). This is [Err3965] and is corrected in this document.

   2007/05/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha224
       Appears in the indicies (Section 4.1 and 4.2] of [RFC6931] when
       it should be "2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha22". This is [Err4004]
       and is corrected in this document.
