           draft-lam-lime-summary-l0-l2-layer-independent-01

Abstract

   This draft summarizes the existing ITU-T SG 15 standards, (Layer 0 -
   Layer 2) both technology-specific and generic across these
   technologies, relevant to leveraging OAM to support fault management,
   performance monitoring, and configuration management.  Knowledge from
   this domain may be leveraged for the benefit of developing generic
   layer independent management for other layers.

Internet-Draft        L0-L2 Independent Management          October 2014


1.  Introduction

   A comprehensive set of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) capabilities is essential for supporting the critical network
   operations of fault management, performance monitoring, and
   configuration management.  For this reason in the ITU-T, Layer 0 -
   Layer 2 technologies have been designed with extensive OAM
   capabilities (e.g., as specified in [ITU-T_G.709], [ITU-T_G.707],
   [ITU-T_G.8012], etc.)  Considerable effort has been expended to
   establish a coherent approach to OAM that allows monitoring of the
   status and performance of (stacked) connections, including generic
   layer independent principles and inter-layer interworking.  Thus, the
   OAM architecture used in transport networks has a common behavior
   across all technologies and layer networks.  This draft summarizes
   ITU-T Recommendations that specify the generic architecture,
   principles, and models, both technology specific and generic,
   developed to support management of L0-L2 connections based upon a
   unified and consistent OAM view of multi-layer networks.  It should
   be noted that the OAM and management framework and requirements for
   MPLS-TP, which is L2.5, has also been based upon these principles
   (e.g., RFC 6371 [RFC6371], RFC 5860 [RFC5860], RFC 5950 [RFC5950],
   and RFC 5951 [RFC5951].

   It is believed that the generic architecture, principles and models
   specified in the material summarized herein may be leveraged in
   considerations of a common approach to OAM management for other layer
   networks (e.g., Layer 3-Layer 7).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   Anomaly: The smallest discrepancy that can be observed between actual
   and desired characteristics of an item.  The occurrence of a single
   anomaly does not constitute an interruption in ability to perform a
   required function.  Anomalies are used as the input for the
   Performance Monitoring (PM) process and for detection of defects
   (from [ITU-T_G.806], Section 3.7).

   Defect: The density of anomalies has reached a level where the
   ability to perform a required function has been interrupted.  Defects
   are used as input for performance monitoring, the control of
   consequent actions, and the determination of fault cause (from
   [ITU-T_G.806], Section 3.24).

Internet-Draft        L0-L2 Independent Management          October 2014


   Fault: A fault is the inability of a function to perform a required
   action.  This does not include an inability due to preventive
   maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned actions (from
   [ITU-T_G.806], Section 3.26).

   Fault cause: A single disturbance or fault may lead to the detection
   of multiple defects.  A fault cause is the result of a correlation
   process that is intended to identify the defect that is
   representative of the disturbance or fault that is causing the
   problem (from [ITU-T_G.806], Section 3.27).

   Failure: The fault cause persisted long enough to consider the
   ability of an item to perform a required function to be terminated.
   The item may be considered as failed; a fault has now been detected
   (from [ITU-T_G.806], Section 3.25).

   Equipment Management Function (EMF): The management functions within
   an NE (see [ITU-T_G.7710]).

   Element Management System (EMS)

   Information Model (IM): An information model condenses domain
   knowledge and insights to provide a representation of its essential
   concepts, structures, and interrelationships.  It models managed
   objects at a conceptual level, independent of any specific
   implementations or protocols used to transport the data.

   Layer 0 - Layer 2: Refers to physical (photonic), physical
   (electrical), and data link (e.g., Ethernet) transport technology,
   respectively.

   Network Management System (NMS)

   Network Element (NE)

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)

   o  On-demand OAM - OAM actions that are initiated via manual
      intervention for a limited time to carry out diagnostics.  On-
      demand OAM can result in singular or periodic OAM actions during
      the diagnostic time interval.

   o  Proactive OAM - OAM actions that are carried on continuously to
      permit timely reporting of fault and/or performance status.

3.  Network Operation Supported by L0-L2 OAM

   OAM mechanisms include the tools and utilities to plan, install,
   monitor and troubleshoot a network layer.  While the specific set of
   OAM mechanisms in a layer depends upon the technology (e.g.,
   [ITU-T_G.709] on OTN, [ITU-T_G.707] on SDH, [ITU-T_G.8013] on
   Ethernet), they all support the same fault management, performance
   monitoring, and configuration management operations and processes.
   As noted previously, MPLS-TP OAM (e.g., [ITU-T_G.8113.2], [RFC6424],
   [RFC6428], etc.) was also designed to support L0-L2 operations and
   processes.  Some OAM functions are implemented in hardware (data
   plane inherent, such as Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM) or
   Performance Monitoring (PM)), while other functions can be
   implemented mostly in lower software layers.

   Fault management includes defect detection, fault localization, fault
   reporting, and protection switching [OTN Handbook, Chapter 3].

   o  Defect detection: Failures affecting the transport of client
      information are detected by continuous pro-active checking.
      Persistent failures are considered to be service-affecting
      defects.  Detected defects are correlated with other detected
      defects to find the most probable cause of the failure and
      consequent actions, such as protection switching, are taken.

   o  Fault localization: If the defect information is insufficient to
      locate the failure, on-demand OAM functions can be used to
      determine the cause of the defect more accurately.

   o  Fault reporting: Persistent defects are reported to the network
      management system to provide the appropriate alarm reports to
      maintenance staff for maintaining the desired quality of service
      level.

   o  Protection switching: After a defect has been detected, a
      protection switch can be initiated as a consequent action to
      restore the interrupted traffic, and thus improve the
      availability.

   Performance monitoring includes measuring the performance (e.g.,
   packet losses, bit errors, etc.) of the transport of client
   information in order to verify the quality of service and to estimate
   the transport integrity.

   Configuration management includes indicating the operational state of
   a connection; e.g., whether it can be used to transport client data
   or whether the set-up of the connection is completed.

4.1.  Generic Transport Layer and Technology Independent Standards

4.1.1.  Generic Transport Architecture

   Recommendations [ITU-T_G.800] and [ITU-T_G.805] provide a technology
   independent and model-based description of transport network
   functionality.  The first generic functional model based architecture
   Recommendation was ITU-T G.805, which describes connection oriented
   networks.  ITU-T G.800 was subsequently developed to provide a common
   framework to describe both connection-oriented and connectionless
   networks.  The descriptions are compatible with those of the earlier
   generic Recommendations (e.g., ITU-T G.805).  These standard model-
   based approaches:

Internet-Draft        L0-L2 Independent Management          October 2014


   o  Enable the description of the generic characteristics of networks
      using a common language at a level that transcends technology and
      physical architecture choices.

   o  Provide a view of functions or entities that may be distributed
      among various equipment.

   o  Concurrently specify transport and management functionality.

   These generic functional architectures of transport networks are the
   basis for a harmonized set of functional architecture Recommendations
   for specific transport layer network technologies that use circuit
   switching or packet switching technology (e.g.  [ITU-T_G.803] for
   SDH, [ITU-T_G.872] for OTN, [ITU-T_G.8010] for Carrier Ethernet,
   [ITU-T_G.8110.1] for MPLS-TP).  These transport technology specific
   architecture Recommendations are used as the basis for a
   corresponding set of Recommendations for equipment specifications,
   including OAM and management.

4.1.2.  Generic processing of transport equipment OAM functions

   The development of the OAM architecture used by ITU-T in transport
   networks started around 1990, and basic generic OAM functions were
   first defined in the period 1990-1993 and described in Recommendation
   [ITU-T_G.806].  Since that time, this initial OAM architecture has
   been extended to assure it remains generic with respect to emerging
   transport technologies.  The extended OAM functionality included the
   definition of a transport maintenance entity with end-points and
   intermediate-points, pro-active and on-demand OAM functions, defect
   correlation, and alarm suppression, etc.  The generic OAM
   architecture in ITU-T G.806 has been used as the common basis for all
   technology-specific transport equipment specifications (e.g.,
   [ITU-T_G.783] for SDH, [ITU-T_G.798] for OTN, [ITU-T_G.8021] for
   Carrier Ethernet, and also [ITU-T_G.8121] for MPLS-TP).

4.1.3.  Generic management requirements

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.7710] specifies the equipment management
   function (EMF) requirements that are common to multiple transport
   technologies and common to packet-based and circuit-based transport
   networks.  The Recommendation addresses the EMF inside a transport
   network element, including the configuration, fault, and performance
   (i.e. the C, F, P of FCAPS) management functions.  The generic
   management requirements in ITU-T G.7710 have been used as the common
   basis for all technology-specific transport management specifications
   (e.g., [ITU-T_G.784] for SDH, [ITU-T_G.874] for OTN, [ITU-T_G.8051]
   for Carrier Ethernet, and [ITU-T_G.8151] for MPLS-TP.

4.1.4.  Generic information model of transport network resources

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.gim] specifies a core information model for
   transport resources.  The model is also applicable to the management
   and control of the transport network regardless of the technology of
   the underlying transport network.  Furthermore, the applicability of
   the information model is independent of the choice of protocol to be
   used in the management and control interfaces.  The core information
   model defined in this Recommendation can be used as the basis for the
   extension of transport/control-technology-specific information
   models.  Such extension will be specified in the technology-specific
   Recommendations, such as [ITU-T_G.774] series for SDH,
   [ITU-T_G.874.1] for OTN management, [ITU-T_G.8052] for Carrier
   Ethernet management, [ITU-T_G.8152] for MPLS-TP management, and
   [ITU-T_G.7718.1] for ASON control plane management.

4.2.  Layer and Technology Specific Standards

4.2.1.  Architecture

   Recommendations [ITU-T_G.803] and [ITU-T_G.872] describe respectively
   the functionality of the SDH and optical transport networks (OTN), L0
   and L1, from a network level perspective using the generic principles
   defined in ITU-T G.805 and ITU-T G.800.  ITU-T G.803 and ITU-T G.872
   describe the specific aspects concerning the SDH and optical
   transport network layered structure, characteristic information,
   client/server layer associations, network topology, and layer network
   functionality.  In accordance with ITU-T G.805 and ITU-T G.800, the
   optical transport network is decomposed into independent transport
   layer networks where each layer network can be separately partitioned
   in a way which reflects the internal structure of that layer network.
   In addition to reflecting the generic fault, configuration, and
   performance management requirements, it describes requirements for
   connection supervision (e.g., continuity, connectivity, required
   maintenance information), signal quality supervision, adaptation
   management, etc.) and connection supervision techniques (i.e.,
   inherent, non-intrusive, intrusive, and sublayer monitoring).

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8010] describes the functional architecture
   of L2 Ethernet networks using the modelling methodology described in
   ITU-T G.800 and ITU-T G.805.  The Ethernet network functionality is
   described from a network level viewpoint, taking into account an
   Ethernet network layered structure, client characteristic
   information, client/server layer associations, networking topology,
   and layer network functionality providing Ethernet signal
   transmission, multiplexing, routing, supervision, performance
   assessment, and network survivability.  Recommendation ITU-T G.8010/
   Y.1306 describes the relevant parts of the Ethernet specifications in

   [IEEE_802.1Q] and [IEEE_802.3] using the ITU-T transport network
   modelling methodology.  The ETH layer network provides the transport
   of adapted information through an ETH connectionless trail between
   ETH access points.  The adapted information is a (non-) continuous
   flow of MAC service data units (IEEE 802.3).

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8110.1] provides functional components, based
   on Recommendation ITU T G.805, that allow the Multi Protocol Label
   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) to be modeled in a way that is
   consistent with the description of other transport technologies
   defined by the ITU-T to simplify integration with other transport
   technologies.  It provides a representation of the MPLS-TP technology
   using the methodologies that have been used for other transport
   technologies (e.g., SDH, OTN and Ethernet).  In G.8110.1, the
   architecture of MPLS-TP forwarding, OAM, and network survivability
   are modeled from a network-level viewpoint.

4.2.2.  Transport Equipment Functions

   Recommendations [ITU-T_G.783] and [ITU-T_G.798] specify both the
   components and the methodology that should be used in order to
   specify the respective SDH and OTN functionality of network elements.
   This Recommendations uses the specification methodology defined in
   [ITU-T_G.806], in general for transport network equipment, and is
   based on the architecture of SDH transport networks defined in
   [ITU-T_G.783] and optical transport networks defined in [ITU-T_G.872]
   and the interfaces for SDH transport networks defined in
   [ITU-T_G.707] and optical transport networks defined in
   [ITU-T_G.709].  The description is generic and no particular physical
   partitioning of functions is implied.  The input/output information
   flows associated with the functional blocks serve for defining the
   functions of the blocks and are considered to be conceptual, not
   physical.  They also provides processes for SDH OAM based on ITU-T
   G.707 and OTN OAM based on ITU-T G.709.  The functionality defined in
   this Recommendation can be applied at user-to-network interfaces
   (UNIs) and network node interfaces (NNIs) of the optical transport
   network.

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8021] specifies both the functional
   components and the methodology that should be used in order to
   specify the L2 Ethernet transport network functionality of network
   elements.  This Recommendation uses the specification methodology
   defined in [ITU-T_G.806] in general for transport network equipment
   and is based on the architecture of Ethernet layer networks defined
   in [ITU-T_G.8010], the interfaces for Ethernet transport networks
   defined in [ITU-T_G.8012], and in support of services defined in the
   ITU-T G.8011.x series of Recommendations.  It also provides processes
   for Ethernet OAM based on [ITU-T_G.8013].  The description is generic

   and no particular physical partitioning of functions is implied.  The
   input/output information flows associated with the functional blocks
   serve to define the functions of the blocks and are considered to be
   conceptual, not physical.  The functionality defined in this
   Recommendation can be applied at user-to-network interfaces (UNIs)
   and network-to-network interfaces (NNIs) of the Ethernet transport
   network.

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8121] specifies both the functional
   components and the methodology that should be used in order to
   specify the multi-protocol label switching transport profile (MPLS-
   TP) layer network functionality of network elements.  This
   Recommendation provides a representation of MPLS-TP technology which
   uses the methodologies that have been used for other transport
   technologies (e.g., optical transport network (OTN) and Ethernet).
   It also provides generic processes for MPLS-TP OAM.  It specifies a
   library of basic building blocks and a set of rules by which they may
   be combined in order to describe digital transmission equipment.  The
   library comprises the functional building blocks needed to specify
   completely the generic functional structure of the MPLS-TP layer
   network.

4.2.3.  Transport management requirements

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.874] addresses management aspects of L0 and
   L1 optical transport network elements containing transport functions
   of one or more layer networks of the optical transport network (OTN).
   It is based on the architecture of optical transport networks defined
   in [ITU-T_G.872], the interfaces for OTN networks defined in
   [ITU-T_G.709], and the OTN equipment function description defined in
   [ITU-T_G.798].  The management functions for fault management,
   configuration management, and performance management are specified.
   Generic requirements in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 that are applicable to
   OTN are identified in ITU-T G.874 via pointer references to ITU-T
   G.7710/Y.1701.  OTN-specific requirements explicitly specified
   include separation of management communication network and signaling
   communication network, OTN fault causes and failures, alarm reporting
   control (ARC) setting, operational state, trail trace identifier
   configuration, adaptation function configuration, connection function
   configuration, tandem connection monitoring control function
   configuration, and the management of the performance primitives.

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8051] addresses management aspects of the L2
   Ethernet Transport capable network element containing transport
   functions of one or more of the layer networks of the Ethernet
   transport network.  The L2 Ethernet specific equipment functional
   blocks are defined in [ITU-T_G.8021].  In this Recommendation, fault
   management, configuration management, and performance management are

   specified.  Generic requirements in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 that are
   applicable to Ethernet are identified in ITU-T G.8051/Y.1345 via
   pointer references to ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701.  Ethernet-specific
   requirements explicitly specified include the management
   communication channel, fault causes and failures, alarm reporting
   control setting, operational state, flow termination function
   configuration, adaptation function configuration, connection function
   configuration, diagnostic function configuration, traffic
   conditioning and shaping function configuration, performance
   monitoring requirements, and the management of the performance
   primitives.

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8151] addresses management aspects of the
   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) capable network element, which is
   separable from that of its client layer networks so that the same
   means of management can be used regardless of the client.  In this
   Recommendation, fault management, configuration management, and
   performance management are specified.  The generic requirements for
   managing transport network elements are specified in [ITU-T_G.7710]
   and the requirements for the management of equipment used in networks
   supporting an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) are specified in [IETF
   RFC 5951].  This Recommendation specifies the requirements for
   managing the MPLS-TP specific equipment functional blocks, which are
   defined in [ITU-T_G.8121].

4.2.4.  Management Information Models

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.874.1] provides a management-protocol-neutral
   information model for managing network elements in the L0 and L1
   optical transport network (OTN) [ITU-T_G.872], [ITU-T_G.709], and
   [ITU-T_G.798] and supporting the management requirements specified in
   [ITU-T_G.7710] and [ITU-T_G.874].  It identifies the managed entities
   required for the management of OTN network elements, including
   Termination Points (TP), Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM), Non-
   Intrusive Monitoring (NIM), Delay Measurement (DM), and the general
   Performance Monitoring (PM) Current Data (CD) and History Data (HD).
   These entities are relevant to information exchanged across
   standardized management interfaces.  The management-protocol-neutral
   information model should be used as the base for defining management-
   protocol-specific data schema.  The specific mapping of the
   management-protocol-neutral information model into management-
   protocol-specific data schema is the decision of the management-
   protocol-specific solution designer.  The information model specified
   in this Recommendation allows for managing the OTN functional
   capabilities of the NE.

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8052] provides a management-protocol-neutral
   information model for managing network elements in the L2 Ethernet

   transport network [ITU-T_G.8010], [ITU-T_G.8012], and [ITU-T_G.8021]
   and supporting the management requirements specified in
   [ITU-T_G.7710] and [ITU-T_G.8051].  It identifies the managed
   entities required for the management of Ethernet transport network
   elements, including Termination Points (TP), Maintenance Entity Group
   (MEG) End Point (MEP), MEG Intermediate Point (MIP), Traffic
   Conditioning and Shaping (TCS), Loss Measurement (LM), Delay
   Measurement (DM), and the general Performance Monitoring (PM) Current
   Data (CD) and History Data (HD).  These entities are relevant to
   information exchanged across standardized management interfaces.  The
   management-protocol-neutral information model should be used as the
   base for defining management-protocol-specific data schema.  The
   specific mapping of the management-protocol-neutral information model
   into management-protocol-specific data schema is the decision of the
   management-protocol-specific solution design.  The information model
   specified in this Recommendation allows for managing the Ethernet
   functional capabilities of the NE.

   It should also be noted that [MEF_7.2] specifies the EMS-NMS
   interface profile needed to support Metro Ethernet services, which
   provides the profile of management entities based on [ITU-T_Q.840.1]
   and [ITU-T_G.8052] and a mapping to the TMF's MTNM 3.5[TMF_MTNM]
   Ethernet model.

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G.8152] provides a management-protocol-neutral
   information model for managing network elements in the L2 MPLS-TP
   network [ITU-T_G.8110.1], [ITU-T_G.8112], and [ITU-T_G.8121] series
   and supporting the management requirements specified in
   [ITU-T_G.7710] and [ITU-T_G.8151].  It identifies the managed
   entities required for the management of MPLS-TP network elements,
   including Termination Points (TP), Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) End
   Point (MEP), MEG Intermediate Point (MIP), Loss Measurement (LM),
   Delay Measurement (DM), and the general Performance Monitoring (PM)
   Current Data (CD) and History Data (HD).  These entities are relevant
   to information exchanged across standardized management interfaces.
   The management-protocol-neutral information model should be used as
   the base for defining management-protocol-specific data schema.  The
   specific mapping of the management-protocol-neutral information model
   into management-protocol-specific data schema is the decision of the
   management-protocol-specific solution design.  The information model
   specified in this Recommendation allows for managing the MPLS-TP
   functional capabilities of the NE.

5.  Discussion

   This draft has provided an introduction to the significant body of
   specifications developed in ITU-T that detail the generic
   architectural principles for OAM in (multi layer) transport networks.

   It also provides an introduction to the specifications that apply
   those general principles in a consistent way to various layered
   transport network technologies.  It is anticipated that the generic
   and layer specific OAM architecture and management specifications
   described in this draft will prove valuable in considerations of
   generic unified approaches to OAM and management for additional
   multilayer networks.
