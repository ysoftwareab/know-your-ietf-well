1. Introduction 

   This document describes the use of SEED [RFC4009] block cipher 
   algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] 
   for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol 
   (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the control traffic for RTP, the 
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED is a national industrial association standard [TTASSEED] and is 
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial 
   services that are operated on wired and wireless communications. 

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed 
   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts 
   since 1998. The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the 
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has the 16-round Feistel structure. 
   A 128-bit input is divided into two 64-bit blocks, and the right 64-
   bit block is an input to the round function with a 64-bit subkey that 
   is generated from the key scheduling. 

   SEED is robust against known attacks including DC (Differential 
   cryptanalysis), LC (Linear cryptanalysis), and related key attacks. 
   SEED has gone through wide public scrutinizing procedures. It has 
   been evaluated and is considered cryptographically secure by credible 
   organizations such as ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27. 

1.2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119]. 

2. Cipher Suite Definitions 

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics 
   and valuables, including mode, key size, weak keys, block size, and 
   rounds. The following sections contain description of the relevant 
   characteristics of SEED. 

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in 
   [ISOSEED] [RFC4009]. The SEED homepage, http://www.kisa.or.kr, 
   contains a wealth of information about SEED, including detailed 
   specification, evaluation report, test vectors, and so on.

2.1. Mode 

   The SEED does not have any restriction for modes of operation that 
   are used in block ciphers. We define 8 modes of running SEED and an 
   implementation may choose to operate in a single mode of operation. 

2.1.1. Counter 

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption, which 
   it refers to as AES-CM. SEED counter mode is defined in a similar 
   manner, and is denoted as SEED_CM respectively. The plaintext inputs 
   to the block cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and the block cipher 
   outputs are processed as in AES-CM. The only difference in the 
   processing is that SEED-CM use SEED. Implementations MUST use SEED-CM 
   in conjunction with an authentication function. The pre-defined 
   authentication transform for SRTP is HMAC-SHA1 [RFC 2104]. SEED-CM 
   uses a 112-bit salt as an input, as does AES-CM. The default session 
   authentication key-length SHALL be 160 bits, the default 
   authentication tag length SHALL be 80 bits, and the 
   SRTP_PREFIX_LENGTH SHALL be zero for HMAC-SHA1. For SRTP, smaller 
   values are NOT RECOMMENDED, but MAY be used after careful 
   consideration of the issues in section 7.5 and 9.5 of [RFC3711].  

2.1.2. Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode [CCM]. In 
   this specification, CCM is used with the SEED block cipher. 

   SEED CCM has two parameters: 

     M   M indicates the size of the authentication tag. In SRTP, a full 
         80-bit authentication-tag SHOULD be used, but a shorter tag or 
         even a zero-length tag MAY be used under certain conditions to 
         support either of the following two application environment 
         described in section 7.5 of [RFC3711]. Implementation MUST 
         support M values of 10 octets, and implementation MAY support M 
         values of less than 10 octets. 

     L   L indicates the size of the length field in octets. In SRTP, 
         the size of length field is 16 bits. Implementations MUST 
         support an L value of 2 octets.

Internet-Draft                SEED-SRTP             September 18, 2008 
    

   SEED-CCM has four inputs: 

     Key 

         A single key is used to calculate the authentication tag using 
         CBC-MAC and to perform payload encryption using counter mode. 
         SEED only supports key size of 128 bits. Implementation MUST 
         support this key size. 

     Nonce 

         The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the 
         parameter L. L equals 2 and that nonce size equals 13. 
         Implementations MUST support a nonce of 13 octets. SEED-CCM 
         nonce is defined as the most significant bits of the 
         initialization vector (IV) defined in section 4.1.1 of 
         [RFC3711]. 

     Payload 

       The payload of the RTP packet. 

     Additional Authentication Data (AAD) 

       The header of the RTP packet. 

   SEED-CCM generates one output: The final result c consists of the 
   encrypted RTP payload followed by the authentication tag. 

2.1.3. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) 

   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both 
   confidentiality and data origin authentication [GCM].GCM is used with 
   the SEED block cipher. 

   SEED-GCM has four inputs: a key, a payload, and an additional 
   authenticated data (AAD) all described in section 2.1.2, and an 
   initialization vector (IV). 

   SEED-GCM defines an IV. The size of the IV is 12 octets. 
   Implementations MUST support this octet size. SEED-GCM IV is defined 
   as the most significant bits of the initialization vector (IV) 
   defined in section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711]. 

2.2. Key Size and Number of Rounds 

   SEED defines 128-bit key and has the 16-round Feistel structure.

2.3. Block Size 

   SEED uses a block size of 16 octets (128 bits). 

2.4. Performance  

   Performance figures of SEED are available at 
   http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html. 

3. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only 
   an exhaustive search for the key. For further security considerations, 
   the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL].
