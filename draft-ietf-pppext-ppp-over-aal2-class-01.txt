Abstract

PPP over AAL2 [1] defines the encapsulation that allows a PPP session to be 
transported over an ATM virtual circuit using the AAL2 adaptation layer. 
Using AAL2 as an adaptation layer for PPP transport over ATM provides a 
bandwidth efficient transport for IP applications that generate small 
packets. An example IP application that generates small packets is RTP 
encapsulated voice (Voice over IP).

In addition to bandwidth efficiency, real-time applications such as voice 
require low latency. RFC 2689 [2] describes an architecture for providing 
transport services for real time applications on low bit rate links. The 
main components of the architecture are: a real-time encapsulation format 
for asynchronous and synchronous low-bitrate links, a header compression 
architecture optimized for real-time flows, elements of negotiation 
protocols used between routers (or between hosts and routers), and 
announcement protocols used by applications to allow this negotiation to 
take place.

This document defines extensions to PPP over AAL2 that can be used to 
implement a fragment-oriented solution for the real-time encapsulation 
format part of the architecture described in [2].

1. Introduction

As an extension to the "best-effort" services the Internet is well-known 
for, additional types of services ("integrated services") that support the 
transport of real-time multimedia information are being developed for, and 
deployed in the Internet.

Multi Class Multi Link PPP [3] defines a fragment-oriented solution for the 
real-time encapsulation format part of the architecture defined in [2], i.e. 
for the queues-of-fragments type sender.  As described in more detail in the 
architecture document, a real-time encapsulation format is required as, 
e.g., a 1500 byte packet on a 128 kbit/s ATM virtual circuit makes this link 
unavailable for the transmission of real-time information for about 100 ms.  
This adds a worst-case delay that causes real-time applications to operate 
with round-trip delays that are too high for many interactive tasks. Multi 
Class Multi Link PPP defines a set of extensions of Multi Link PPP [4] that 
enable the sender to fragment the packets of various priorities into 
multiple classes of fragments, allowing high-priority packets to be sent 
between fragments of lower priorities.

This document defines a set of class extensions to PPP over AAL2 [1] that 
implement equivalent functionality to Multi Class Multi Link PPP over a 
single ATM virtual circuit. Instead of using Multi Link PPP as the basis for 
fragmentation functionality, this document uses the functionality of the 
Segmentation and Reassembly Service Specific Convergence Sublayer (SSSAR)[5] 
that is already required as the basic encapsulation format of PPP over AAL2.

In addition to providing fragmentation, the real time transport service must 
allow high priority fragments to be sent between fragments of lower 
priorities. This can be accomplished in PPP over AAL2 by allowing a single 
PPP session to span multiple AAL2 CPS [6] Channel Identifiers. Once a PPP 
session spans multiple AAL2 Channel IDs, the Channel ID can be used to 
identify the class that a fragment belongs to. Fragments belonging to a high 
priority class can be sent using a particular AAL2 Channel ID. Fragments of 
lower priority classes can be sent using different AAL2 Channel IDs. Once 
multiple fragment classes are identified using different AAL2 Channel IDs, 
the AAL2 CPS layer can be used to send fragments belonging to a high 
priority class between fragments of lower priorities.

The class based extensions to PPP over AAL2 use existing services of the 
AAL2 SSCS and CPS layers already specified in PPP over AAL2. Because of 
this, the extensions described in this draft may be viewed as a desirable 
alternative to Multi Class Multi Link PPP in providing a class based 
transport service with PPP over AAL2.

1.1.  Specification Language

The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, 
RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be 
interpreted as described in [6].

2. Requirements

This document assumes the same service requirements as defined in Multi 
Class Multi Link PPP [3]. The reader is referred to section 2 of Multi Class 
Multi Link PPP for the general requirements of a multi class fragmentation / 
preemption service.

3. Class Extensions for PPP over AAL2

PPP over AAL2 uses the Segmentation and Reassembly Service Specific 
Convergence Sublayer (SSSAR) [5] for the AAL type 2. The SSSAR sublayer is 
used to segment PPP packets into frames that can be transported using the 
AAL2 CPS. The SSSAR sublayer uses different AAL2 UUI code-points to indicate 
whether a segment is the last segment of a packet or not. SSSAR provides 
basic fragmentation functionality for all packets encapsulated using PPP 
over AAL2. The SSSAR layer fragments all packets into 64 byte fragments.

The AAL2 CPS layer defines a Channel ID that is used to identify multiple 
streams of packets within a single ATM Virtual Circuit. In this document, 
the AAL2 CPS Channel ID is used to identify the preemption class that a 
packet fragment belongs to. Since the Channel ID is used to identify 
different preemption classes, packet fragments from each class of traffic 
MUST be assigned to different Channel IDs. In addition, each PPP session 
MUST have at least as many Channel IDs assigned as there are different 
classes of preemptible traffic.

To allow PPP packets to be assigned to different preemption classes, PPP 
packets must be classified into multiple preemption classes as they are 
fragmented using SSSAR. Many classification methods may be used to determine 
the class that a particular PPP packet belongs to. The architecture document 
[2] describes possible alternatives that MAY be used to implement a real 
time classification scheme.

Once packets have been classified into different premption classes, each 
class of traffic is then assigned a different Channel ID. Since fragments 
from each traffic class are now transmitted using separate Channel ID, the 
AAL2 CPS layer can be used to schedule fragments from the different classes. 
The AAL2 CPS specification [6] does not specify a method for scheduling AAL2 
CPS payloads from different Channel IDs. The scheduling method required at 
the AAL2 CPS layer depends upon the real time requirements of applications 
using this service. Some real-time applications MAY require the use of a 
priority based CID scheduler. Other applications MAY only require a fair or 
weighted fair CID scheduler. Implementations of PPP over AAL2 real time 
transport extensions SHOULD implement AAL2 CPS CID schedulers that meet the 
requirements of multi-class real time applications. 

4. Example Implementation: Class Based Extensions for Voice Service

When PPP over AAL2 is used to transport both voice and non-voice packets over 
low bandwidth ATM virtual circuits, it may be necessary to preempt the 
transmission of a large data packet in order to transmit a voice packet with 
minimal delay. The example implementation described below shows an example of 
how the class extensions for PPP over AAL2 can be used to support a real time 
voice transport service over low bandwidth AAL2 virtual circuits. To 
guarantee low latency and loss for voice transport, the ATM virtual circuit 
in this example must be provisioned using a real time traffic class such as 
VBRnrt or VBRrt.

For the simple voice service described above, 2 classes are sufficient to 
guarantee low latency for voice packets. The PPP over AAL2 session in this 
case can be configured to run across 2 AAL2 CPS Channel IDs. One channel ID 
is used to transport large data packets while the other channel ID is used to 
transport real time voice packets.

Packets that arrive at the PPP interface must first be classified as either 
belonging to the real time class or belonging to the data class. A simple 
classifier that can be used to classify packets at this layer is packet size. 
Large packets are assigned to the non-real time (or data) traffic class and 
small packets are assigned to the real time traffic class. The packet size 
used to discriminate between real time and non real time packets may vary 
based on the application and transmission rate of the virtual circuit.

Once packets have been classified, they are now fragmented using the SSSAR 
layer of PPP over AAL2. Separate instances of the SSSAR fragmentation 
function run on each of the 2 Channel IDs assigned to the PPP session. 
Fragments coming from the SSSAR functions are now scheduled into the AAL2 
virtual circuit using the AAL2 CPS layer. Most AAL2 SAR implementations 
currently implement fair scheduling across multiple AAL2 Channel IDs. Since 
the AAL2 CPS scheduler implements fair scheduling, real time fragments will 
wait for at most one non-real time fragment to be transmitted on the AAL2 
virtual circuit before being scheduled. 

7.  Security Considerations

Operation of this protocol is believed to be no more and no less secure than
operation of PPP over AAL2 [1].
