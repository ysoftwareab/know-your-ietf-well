Abstract 
    
   In multihomed mobile networks, multiple Mobile Routers can be 
   deployed to provide fault recovery or load sharing. Also, each Mobile 
   Router (MR) can have a bi-directional tunnel with its own Home Agent 
   (HA). In this multihomed mobile network scenario, the neighbor root 
   MR can replace or share the operation of another MR. Therefore, MRs 
   should cooperate with each other to provide session continuity or 
   load sharing. We present an authentication and registration mechanism 
   without introducing extra signaling messages. Using the Return

   Routability procedure of Mobile IPv6 and the Binding Update message  
   with the neighbor MR registration option, the MR can authenticate and

1. Introduction 
    
   In multihomed mobile networks, multiple MRs can be used to provide 
   fault recovery or load sharing [6]. To support these properties, each 
   MR should cooperate with neighbor MRs. For fault recovery, each MR 
   should substitute the other MR in case of MR failure. And for load 
   sharing, the HA should dynamically make a tunnel through any MR in 
   the multihomed mobile network.

Internet Draft Neighbor MR Authentication and Registration  April 2004 
 
 
   To provide fault recovery, the nested tunnel recovery mechanism [3] 
   was introduced. In case of the egress link failure of the MR, the MR 
   can be allocated the new Care-of-Address (CoA) from the neighbor root 
   MR and make another tunnel through the nested tunnel. From this 
   solution, however, the previous session can be continued only in case 
   of link failure. In case of MR failure, the neighbor MR can not 
   cooperate with each other without any previous neighbor information. 
   Related threats are already treated at the multihoming threat 
   analysis draft [10]. To solve the tunnel failure problem, the 
   neighbor MR authentication and registration mechanism is needed. This 
   registration mechanism can be applied tunnel recovery, dynamic load 
   sharing, or bi-casting. 
    
   In this document, we introduce the neighbor MR authentication and 
   registration mechanism using Return Routability Procedure and Binding 
   Update message. Compared to the NEMO basic support protocol [2], we 
   only introduce the Neighbor MR Registration Option in Binding Update 
   message as a mobility option. This solution is quite simple and can 
   be applied to solve various problems, like not only link failure, but 
   MR failure, load sharing, or bi-casting by the HA. 
    
   Also, we present a possible solution, named as a HA-based Tunnel 
   Recovery Mechanism in multihomed mobile networks at Section A. After 
   detecting the broken tunnel, the HA can initiate the tunnel recovery 
   with an alternative MR. Also, this mechanism can be applied to the 
   dynamic load sharing or bi-casting. For load sharing or bi-casting, 
   the HA can make another tunnel with a neighbor MR.  
    
    
2. Terminology 
    
   It is assumed that readers are familiar with NEMO terminology 
   described in [3, 7], and the terms described in [2, 6].  
    
   The neighbor MR 
    
     In this document, we only consider the MR which has a connection  
     to the fixed Internet. This MR is defined as a root MR at the  
     terminology draft [7]. Therefore, the neighbor MR is also the root 
     MR at the same multihomed mobile network with a connection to the 
     fixed Internet. 
    
   The neighbor HA 
    
     We define the neighbor HA which is a correspond HA of the neighbor 
     MR. The MR has a secure association with its own HA, but the 
     neighbor MR does not have any relation with another HA. Originally, 
     the neighbor HA is not known to other MRs. 
    
   The neighbor MR information

     In this document, we define the neighbor MR information which can  
     be acquired from the neighbor MR or neighbor HA. This MR  
     information is the Home Address, Care-of Address, and Mobile 
     Network Prefix. 
    
    
3. Related Multihoming Scenarios and Problem Definition 
    
   In this draft, we are focusing on (N, N, 1) and (N, N, N) cases in 
   multihoming issue draft [3]. From the view of problem oriented 
   approach in the multihoming issue draft, the DoubleBed case can be 
   this class. In this case, some related threats are identified in 
   threat analysis draft [8, 9, 10]. In these multihomed mobile networks, 
   the sub mobile network can join and leave dynamically. The MR should 
   authenticate and register neighbor MRs to provide fault recovery and 
   load sharing. In some situation, MRs can be manually configured by 
   the network administrators especially if MRs are in the same 
   administrative domain. However, it is highly desirable for mobile 
   routers to discover alternate MRs automatically for greater 
   flexibility. Therefore, the dynamic authentication and registration 
   mechanism is crucial. 
    
    
4. Tunnel Alteration Scenarios 
    
   In this section, we discuss tunnel alteration scenarios. To provide 
   fault recovery, broken tunnel scenarios should be considered. Broken 
   tunnel scenarios can be classified as link failure and MR failure. 
   And for load sharing or bi-casting, non-associated MRs and HAs pair 
   should be able to make the bi-directional tunnel dynamically. By 
   classifying the broken tunnel cases and reviewing the load sharing, 
   we identify the reason of neighbor MR registration. 
    
4.1 Link Failure  
    
   Usually, the MR uses the wireless channel as an access channel for 
   the mobility support. This wireless channel has unreliability because 
   of channel error, blackout, or handover. From these factors, sudden 
   link failure can be happen. Even though the wireless channel is not 
   broken, in case of highly degraded channel, an alternative link can 
   be cost effective. In this case, this high-loss channel can be 
   treated as a broken link. 
    
4.2 MR Failure  
    
   The MR itself can have a problem, like an operating system bug, 
   packet queue overflow, the lack of CPU cycle, data structure overflow, 
   power supply problem, etc. Sudden hardware failures can happen, and

   this problem affects whole network nodes in the mobile network. These 
   node problems can cause sudden service suspension.  
    
   And, the MR is easy to expose to malicious attacks. Because of the 
   mobility, the MR can be a target of any kinds of Denial-of-Service 
   attacks. And detecting attacks is much harder than that of fixed 
   nodes. Because the MR usually uses the wireless channel, the wireless 
   link itself is more vulnerable for attacks. Especially, the MR can 
   experience DoS attacks, like packet flooding, data structure attack 
   using malicious requests or reflected Denial-of-Service attacks.  
    
   In these cases, the MR cannot activate the alternative tunnel 
   recovery. Therefore, sessions using the previous tunnel cannot be 
   recovered after failure. 
    
4.3 Dynamic Load Sharing or Bi-casting 
    
   To support dynamic load sharing, non-associated MRs and HAs should 
   cooperate with each other. For traffic from the mobile network, each 
   MR can share its traffic load with neighbor MRs. In that case, each 
   MR should have the neighbor MR information. For the traffic from the 
   outside network, the need for load sharing through HAs can exist. If 
   this traffic sharing is done from the HA side, HAs should share 
   neighbor MRs’ information in the same mobile network. Using this 
   information, neighbor HA can make a bi-directional tunnel with the 
   alternative MR. 
    
    
5. Neighbor MR Authentication and Registration  
    
   In this section, we present our Neighbor MR Authentication and 
   Registration Mechanism. Our mechanism consists of Neighbor MRs 
   Discovery, neighbor MR Authentication using Return Routability 
   Procedure, and neighbor MRs Registration using Binding Update message.  
    
5.1 Neighbor MRs Discovery 
    
   By listening Router Advertisement (RA) messages on the *ingress* 
   interface, the MR can get information of neighbor MRs. This Router 
   Advertisement can be initiated from the explicit Router Solicitation 
   (RS) message. The root MR which is at the visiting network should 
   response to this RS message from the ingress interface. And the 
   responding RA message should contain its own Home Address and Mobile 
   Network Prefix as an option. From this neighbor discovery process, 
   the MR can acquire neighbor MR's information, like Home Address (HoA), 
   Care-of-Address (CoA), and Mobile Network Prefix (MNP).  
    
5.2 Neighbor MR Authentication using Return Routability

Internet Draft Neighbor MR Authentication and Registration  April 2004 
 
 
   After acquiring the neighbor MR information, the MR can authenticate 
   the received neighbor MR information. Because the MR operates both as 
   the Mobile Node (MN) of Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [1] and the MR of NEMO 
   basic support protocol, the MR can operate as a MN to the neighbor MR. 
   As a MN of MIPv6, the MR initiates the Return Routability procedure 
   with the neighbor MR. Using the Home Test and Care-of Test, the MR 
   can authenticate its own HoA and CoA to the neighbor MR. Therefore, 
   after the mutual Return Routability procedure, each MR can 
   authenticate the neighbor MRs which are discovered from the RA 
   message. 
    
5.3 Neighbor MR Registration with the Binding Update Message 
    
   After the above Return Routability procedure finished successfully, 
   the MR can register the neighbor MRs with Binding Update message. 
   With an option noted as the Neighbor MR Registration Option, the MR 
   registers acquired neighbor MRs’ HoA, CoA, MNP to its own HA. This 
   registration is periodically repeated as the BU sent. From this 
   periodic registration, the HA can keep the last neighbor MRs list. 
    
   An example is explained in Figure 1. From the neighbor discovery 
   process, MR2 can get the neighbor MR information from the RA message. 
   Here, the RS process can be optional. After neighbor discovery, MR2 
   initiates Home Test Init message and Care-of Test Init message for 
   the Return Routability test. Of course, MR1 also initiates the Return 
   Routability procedure. From this mutual Return Routability test, each 
   MR can authenticate the neighbor MR information. If the Return 
   Routability test is failed, MR1 may discard the neighbor information. 
   If the Return Routability test is succeeded, MR1 update this neighbor 
   MR information to the Neighbor MR List and sends the Binding Update 
   message with the Neighbor MR Registration option. After receiving BU 
   from MR1, HA1 updates the neighbor MR information to the Neighbor MR 
   List. And HA1 sends the Binding Acknowledgement.

6. Additional Data Structure for Multihoming  
    
6.1 Neighbor MR List for Mobile Router  
    
   The Mobile Router keeps the Neighbor MR List. In this Neighbor MR 
   List, the HA address, the HoA, CoA, and MNP pairs of neighbor MRs are 
   kept. The HA address can be obtained from the Home Test of the Return 
   Routability procedure. And other information is obtained and verified 
   from the above authentication and registration process. This neighbor 
   MR list of the MR can be used when the data packet is received from 
   the neighbor HA. After receiving the IP-in-IP encapsulated packet, 
   the MR can verify by checking whether the outer packet's source 
   address is the HA address of the neighbor Mobile Router and the inner 
   packet’ destination address belongs to the MNP. 
    
   This neighbor MR List should be updated from the periodic Router 
   Advertisement message.  
    
6.2 Neighbor MR List for Home Agent   
    
   The Home Agent keeps the Neighbor MR List of the multihomed MR. In 
   this Neighbor MR List, the HoA, CoA, and MNP pairs of the neighbor MR 
   should be kept. This neighbor MR list can be used when the data 
   tunnel are recovered or the traffics are shared with the neighbor MR. 
   In case of a tunnel recovery, the MR can select the alternative MR 
   from this Neighbor MR List. Using the CoA of neighbor MR, the HA can 
   make a bi-directional tunnel with the alternative MR. In case of load 
   sharing, the HA can verify the bi-directional tunnel which comes from 
   the neighbor MR or HA, for the outbound and inbound traffic 
   respectively. After receiving the load-shared IP-in-IP encapsulated 
   packet, the Home Agent can verify by checking whether the outer 
   packet's source address is the HA address or the neighbor MR and the 
   inner packets's destination address belongs to the MNP. 
    
   This neighbor MR List should be updated from the periodic Binding 
   Update message. 
    
    
7. Additional Messages to NEMO Basic Support Protocol   
    
7.1 Neighbor MR Registration Option 
    
   This Neighbor MR Registration Option is included in the Binding 
   Update message as a mobility option to register the neighbor MR. 
   There could be multiple Neighbor MR Registration Options if there 
   exist multiple MRs at the mobile network. The Neighbor MR 
   Registration Option has an alignment requirement.  
    
   Figure 2 shows the Neighbor MR Registration Option format.

7.2 Binding Acknowledgement Status 
    
   This document also introduces the following new Binding 
   Acknowledgement status value.  
    
     144     Neighbor MR Registration failed 
    
   This message is used to notify the failed neighbor MR registration. 
   If the HA cannot provide the functionality of managing Neighbor MR 
   List or wants to deny the registration request, the Binding 
   Acknowledgement can be returned with this status value. 
    
    
8. Conclusion 
    
   In this draft, we propose a Neighbor MR Authentication and 
   Registration mechanism for multihomed mobile networks without new 
   signaling message. Using Return Routability procedure of MIPv6 and 
   Binding Update with a new option of NEMO basic support protocol, the 
   MR can authenticate and register neighbor MRs to its own HA. This 
   solution is quite simple and can be applied to solve various problems, 
   like not only link failure, but MR failure, load sharing, or bi-
   casting by the HA.  
    
    
9. Security Considerations 
    
   Related security problems are treated at the draft, "Threats for 
   Multi-homed Mobile Networks" [10]. Similar threats are also mentioned 
   at other drafts [8, 9].

A. HA-based Tunnel Recovery Mechanism 
    
   We also consider the HA-based Tunnel Recovery Mechanism using above 
   registered neighbor MR information. This mechanism consists of the 
   broken tunnel detection, the tunnel recovery request/response process, 
   and tunnel recovery by the neighbor MR.  
    
   There already exists some tunnel availability test from the HA. The 
   multihoming issue draft [3] considers "tunnel liveness". Basically, 
   the periodic Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement exchange can 
   check the tunnel liveness. By sending binding updates regularly with 
   shorter livetime value, the HA can check the tunnel liveness. This 
   however may be overhead because the Binding Update message SHOULD be 
   encrypted. And another kinds of method is "tunnel heartbeats". If 
   there exists no data packets exchange, small probe packets can be 
   exchanged between the HA and the MR for shorter period of binding 
   updates. Using this mechanism, the HA can detect the broken tunnel 
   caused by either link failure or MR failure. This active probing can 
   be used for more reliable tunnel liveness. 
    
   After detecting the tunnel failure, the HA can select the neighbor MR 
   from the Neighbor MR List to recover the previous tunnel. This tunnel 
   can be nested through the neighbor HA if we apply the NEMO Basic 
   Support protocol. Also, this tunnel can be directly delivered to the 
   neighbor MR using any route optimization mechanism. The HA sends the 
   Tunnel Recovery Request message to the selected neighbor MR. Tunnel 
   Recovery Request include the HA's IP Address, MR's Home Address, and 
   Mobile Network Prefix. And the neighbor MR can verify the request by 
   checking own Neighbor MR List. If the HA requests the tunneling for 
   the valid neighbor MR, then it decides whether it can serve the 
   request or not. And it responds to the HA with the Tunnel Recovery 
   Response message. 
    
   If the HA is approved to make a recovered tunnel with the neighbor MR, 
   the HA can detour packets to the neighbor MR. And the MR can check 
   the bi-directional tunnel by checking the outer packet's source 
   address and the inner packet's destination address. If tunneled 
   packets are valid, then tunneled packets can be decapsulated and 
   delivered to the destination node.
