1.  Introduction

   This document describes a YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] data model for
   routing policy configuration based on operational usage and best
   practices in a variety of service provider networks.  The model is
   intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators to manage
   policy configuration in a consistent, intuitive way in heterogeneous
   environments with routers supplied by multiple vendors.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA)[I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model                 June 2018


1.1.  Goals and approach

   This model does not aim to be feature complete -- it is a subset of
   the policy configuration parameters available in a variety of vendor
   implementations, but supports widely used constructs for managing how
   routes are imported, exported, and modified across different routing
   protocols.  The model development approach has been to examine actual
   policy configurations in use across a number of operator networks.
   Hence the focus is on enabling policy configuration capabilities and
   structure that are in wide use.

   Despite the differences in details of policy expressions and
   conventions in various vendor implementations, the model reflects the
   observation that a relatively simple condition-action approach can be
   readily mapped to several existing vendor implementations, and also
   gives operators an intuitive and straightforward way to express
   policy without sacrificing flexibility.  A side affect of this design
   decision is that legacy methods for expressing policies are not
   considered.  Such methods could be added as an augmentation to the
   model if needed.

   Consistent with the goal to produce a data model that is vendor
   neutral, only policy expressions that are deemed to be widely
   available in existing major implementations are included in the
   model.  Those configuration items that are only available from a
   single implementation are omitted from the model with the expectation
   they will be available in separate vendor-provided modules that
   augment the current model.

2.  Model overview

   The routing policy module has three main parts:

   o  A generic framework to express policies as sets of related
      conditions and actions.  This includes match sets and actions that
      are useful across many routing protocols.

   o  A structure that allows routing protocol models to add protocol-
      specific policy conditions and actions though YANG augmentations.
      There is a complete example of this for BGP [RFC4271] policies in
      the proposed vendor-neutral BGP data model
      [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

   o  A reusable grouping for attaching import and export rules in the
      context of routing configuration for different protocols, VRFs,
      etc.  This also enables creation of policy chains and expressing
      default policy behavior.

   The module makes use of the standard Internet types, such as IP
   addresses, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in RFC 6991
   [RFC6991].

3.  Route policy expression

   Policies are expressed as a sequence of top-level policy definitions
   each of which consists of a sequence of policy statements.  Policy
   statements in turn consist of simple condition-action tuples.
   Conditions may include multiple match or comparison operations, and
   similarly, actions may effect multiple changes to route attributes,
   or indicate a final disposition of accepting or rejecting the route.
   This structure is shown below.

      +--rw routing-policy
         +--rw policy-definitions
            +--rw policy-definition* [name]
               +--rw name          string
               +--rw statements
                  +--rw statement* [name]
                     +--rw name          string
                     +--rw conditions
                     |     ...
                     +--rw actions
                           ...

3.1.  Defined sets for policy matching

   The models provides a set of generic sets that can be used for
   matching in policy conditions.  These sets are applicable for route
   selection across multiple routing protocols.  They may be further
   augmented by protocol-specific models which have their own defined
   sets.  The supported defined sets include:

   o  prefix sets - define a set of IP prefixes, each with an associated
      CIDR netmask range (or exact length)

   o  neighbor sets - define a set of neighboring nodes by their IP
      addresses.  These sets are used for selecting routes based on the
      neighbors advertising the routes.

   o  tag set - define a set of generic tag values that can be used in
      matches for filtering routes

   The model structure for defined sets is shown below.

          |        +--rw tag-value*   tag-type


3.2.  Policy conditions

   Policy statements consist of a set of conditions and actions (either
   of which may be empty).  Conditions are used to match route
   attributes against a defined set (e.g., a prefix set), or to compare
   attributes against a specific value.

   Match conditions may be further modified using the match-set-options
   configuration which allows operators to change the behavior of a
   match.  Three options are supported:

   o  ALL - match is true only if the given value matches all members of
      the set.

   o  ANY - match is true if the given value matches any member of the
      set.

   o  INVERT - match is true if the given value does not match any
      member of the given set.

   Not all options are appropriate for matching against all defined sets
   (e.g., match ALL in a prefix set does not make sense).  In the model,
   a restricted set of match options is used where applicable.

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model                 June 2018


   Comparison conditions may similarly use options to change how route
   attributes should be tested, e.g., for equality or inequality,
   against a given value.

   While most policy conditions will be added by individual routing
   protocol models via augmentation, this routing policy model includes
   several generic match conditions and also the ability to test which
   protocol or mechanism installed a route (e.g., BGP, IGP, static,
   etc.).  The conditions included in the model are shown below.

                  |     +--rw tag-set?
                  |     +--rw match-set-options?

3.3.  Policy actions

   When policy conditions are satisfied, policy actions are used to set
   various attributes of the route being processed, or to indicate the
   final disposition of the route, i.e., accept or reject.

   Similar to policy conditions, the routing policy model includes
   generic actions in addition to the basic route disposition actions.
   These are shown below.

                       +--rw set-preference?   uint8

3.4.  Policy subroutines

   Policy 'subroutines' (or nested policies) are supported by allowing
   policy statement conditions to reference other policy definitions
   using the call-policy configuration.  Called policies apply their
   conditions and actions before returning to the calling policy
   statement and resuming evaluation.  The outcome of the called policy
   affects the evaluation of the calling policy.  If the called policy
   results in an accept-route (either explicit or by default), then the
   subroutine returns an effective boolean true value to the calling
   policy.  For the calling policy, this is equivalent to a condition
   statement evaluating to a true value and evaluation of the policy
   continues (see Section 4).  Note that the called policy may also
   modify attributes of the route in its action statements.  Similarly,
   a reject-route action returns false and the calling policy evaluation
   will be affected accordingly.  Consequently, a subroutine cannot
   explicitly accept or reject a route.  Rather it merely provides an
   indication that 'call-policy' condition returns boolean true or false
   indicating whether or not the condition matches.  Route acceptance or
   rejection is solely determined by the top-level policy.

   Note that the called policy may itself call other policies (subject
   to implementation limitations).  The model does not prescribe a
   nesting depth because this varies among implementations.  For
   example, some major implementation may only support a single level of
   subroutine recursion.  As with any routing policy construction, care
   must be taken with nested policies to ensure that the effective
   return value results in the intended behavior.  Nested policies are a
   convenience in many routing policy constructions but creating
   policies nested beyond a small number of levels (e.g., 2-3) should be
   discouraged.

4.  Policy evaluation

   Evaluation of each policy definition proceeds by evaluating its
   corresponding individual policy statements in order.  When a
   condition statement in a policy statement is satisfied, the
   corresponding action statement is executed.  If the action statement

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model                 June 2018


   has either accept-route or reject-route actions, evaluation of the
   current policy definition stops, and no further policy definitions in
   the chain are evaluated.

   If the condition is not satisfied, then evaluation proceeds to the
   next policy statement.  If none of the policy statement conditions
   are satisfied, then evaluation of the current policy definition
   stops, and the next policy definition in the chain is evaluated.
   When the end of the policy chain is reached, the default route
   disposition action is performed (i.e., reject-route unless an
   alternate default action is specified for the chain).

5.  Applying routing policy

   Routing policy is applied by defining and attaching policy chains in
   various routing contexts.  Policy chains are sequences of policy
   definitions (described in Section 3) that have an associated
   direction (import or export) with respect to the routing context in
   which they are defined.  The routing policy model defines an apply-
   policy grouping that can be imported and used by other models.  As
   shown below, it allows definition of import and export policy chains,
   as well as specifying the default route disposition to be used when
   no policy definition in the chain results in a final decision.

         +--rw apply-policy
         |  +--rw import-policy*
         |  +--rw default-import-policy?   default-policy-type
         |  +--rw export-policy*
         |  +--rw default-export-policy?   default-policy-type

   The default policy defined by the model is to reject the route for
   both import and export policies.

6.  Routing protocol-specific policies

   Routing models that require the ability to apply routing policy may
   augment the routing policy model with protocol or other specific
   policy configuration.  The routing policy model assumes that
   additional defined sets, conditions, and actions may all be added by
   other models.

   An example of this is shown below, in which the BGP configuration
   model in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] adds new defined sets to match on
   community values or AS paths.  The model similarly augments BGP-
   specific conditions and actions in the corresponding sections of the
   routing policy model.

7.  Security Considerations

   Routing policy configuration has a significant impact on network
   operations, and, as such, any related model carries potential
   security risks.

   YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the NETCONF
   protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an authenticated and
   secure channel over which to transfer configuration and operational
   data.  Note that use of alternate transport or data encoding (e.g.,
   JSON over HTTPS) would require similar mechanisms for authenticating
   and securing access to configuration data.

   Most of the data elements in the policy model could be considered
   sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized access or invalid
   data could cause major disruption.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This YANG data model and the component modules currently use a
   temporary ad-hoc namespace.  If and when it is placed on redirected
   for the standards track, an appropriate namespace URI will be
   registered in the IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].  The routing policy
   YANG modules will be registered in the "YANG Module Names" registry
   [RFC6020].

        managing how routes are imported, exported, and modified across
        different routing protocols.  This module is intended to be used
        in conjunction with routing protocol configuration modules
        (e.g., BGP) defined in other models.

        Route policy expression:

        Policies are expressed as a set of top-level policy definitions,
        each of which consists of a sequence of policy statements.
        Policy statements consist of simple condition-action tuples.
        Conditions may include mutiple match or comparison operations,
        and similarly actions may be multitude of changes to route
        attributes or a final disposition of accepting or rejecting the
        route.

        Route policy evaluation:

        Policy definitions are referenced in routing protocol
        configurations using import and export configuration statements.
        The arguments are members of an ordered list of named policy
        definitions which comprise a policy chain, and optionally, an
        explicit default policy action (i.e., reject or accept).

        Evaluation of each policy definition proceeds by evaluating its
        corresponding individual policy statements in order.  When a
        condition statement in a policy statement is satisfied, the
        corresponding action statement is executed.  If the action
        statement has either accept-route or reject-route actions,
        policy evaluation of the current policy definition stops, and
        no further policy definitions in the chain are evaluated.

        If the condition is not satisfied, then evaluation proceeds to
        the next policy statement.  If none of the policy statement
        conditions are satisfied, then evaluation of the current policy
        definition stops, and the next policy definition in the chain is
        evaluated.  When the end of the policy chain is reached, the
        default route disposition action is performed (i.e.,
        reject-route unless an alternate default action is specified
        for the chain).

        Policy 'subroutines' (or nested policies) are supported by
        allowing policy statement conditions to reference another policy
        definition which applies conditions and actions from the
        referenced policy before returning to the calling policy
        statement and resuming evaluation.  If the called policy
        results in an accept-route (either explicit or by default), then
        the subroutine returns an effective true value to the calling
        policy.  Similarly, a reject-route action returns false.  If the

        evaluate the remaining conditions (using a modified route if the
        subroutine performed any changes to the route).";

10.  Policy examples

   Below we show an example of XML-encoded configuration data using the
   routing policy and BGP models to illustrate both how policies are
   defined, and also how they can be applied.  Note that the XML has
   been simplified for readability.
