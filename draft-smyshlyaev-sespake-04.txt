   ||      concatenation of byte strings A and C, i.e., if A in B_n1, C
           in B_n2, A = (a_1,a_2,...,a_n1) and C = (c_1,c_2,...,c_n2),

           length of the byte representations of the coordinates X and Y
           is equal to the minimum possible length of the byte
           representation of the subgroup generator p.

4.  Mathematical definitions

   Suppose a prime number p > 3 is given.  Then, an elliptic curve E,
   defined over a finite prime field GF(p), is the set of number pairs
   (x,y), where x and y belong to Fp, satisfying the identity:

      y^2 = x^3 + a * x + b (mod p),

   where a, b belong to GF(p) and 4 * a^3 + 27 * b^2 is not congruent to
   zero modulo p.

   An invariant of the elliptic curve is the value J(E), satisfying the
   equality:

                       4 * a^3
   J(E) = 1728 * ------------------ (mod p),
                 4 * a^3 + 27 * b^2

   Elliptic curve E coefficients a, b are defined in the following way
   using the invariant J(E):

   | a = 3 * k (mod p),
   |
   | b = 2 * k (mod p),

                J(E)
   where k = ----------- (mod p), J(E) /= 0 or 1728.
             1728 - J(E)

   The pairs (x, y) satisfying the identity (1) are called "the elliptic
   curve E points"; x and y are called x- and y-coordinates of the
   point, correspondingly.

   We will denote elliptic curve points as Q(x, y) or just Q.  Two
   elliptic curve points are equal if their x- and y-coordinates are
   equal.

   On the set of all elliptic curve E points, we will define the
   addition operation, denoted by "+".  For two arbitrary elliptic curve
   E points Q1 (x1, y1) and Q2 (x2, y2), we will consider several
   variants.

   Suppose coordinates of points Q1 and Q2 satisfy the condition x1 /=
   x2.  In this case, their sum is defined as a point Q3 (x3, y3), with
   coordinates defined by congruencies:

   | x3 = lambda^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p),
   |
   | y3 = lambda * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p),

                   y1 - y2
   where lambda = -------- (mod p).
                   x1 - x2

   If x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 /= 0, then we will define point Q3 coordinates
   in the following way:

   | x3 = lambda^2 - x1 * 2 (mod p),
   |
   | y3 = lambda * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p),

                   3 * x1^2 + a
   where lambda = ------------ (mod p).
                      y1 * 2

   If x1 = x2 and y1 = -y2 (mod p), then the sum of points Q1 and Q2 is
   called a zero point O, without determination of its x- and y-
   coordinates.  In this case, point Q2 is called a negative of point
   Q1.  For the zero point, the equalities hold:

      O + Q = Q + O = Q,

   where Q is an arbitrary point of elliptic curve E.

   A set of all points of elliptic curve E, including the zero point,
   forms a finite abelian (commutative) group of order m regarding the
   introduced addition operation.  For m, the following inequalities
   hold:

      p + 1 - 2 * sqrt(p) =< m =< p + 1 + 2 * sqrt(p).

   The point Q is called "a point of multiplicity k", or just "a
   multiple point of the elliptic curve E", if for some point P, the
   following equality holds:

   Q = P + ... + P = k * P
       -----+-----
           k

5.  Protocol description

   The protocol is used by subjects A and B that are commencing key
   establishment with password-based authentication.

5.1.  Protocol parameters

   Various elliptic curves can be used in the protocol.  For each
   elliptic curve supposted by clients the following values must be
   defined:

   o  the curve identifier ID_ALG, that is a byte string of arbitrary
      length;

   o  the point P, that is a generator point of the subgroup of order q
      of the curve;

   o  the set of distinct curve points {Q_1,Q_2,...,Q_N} of order q,
      where the total number of points N is defined for protocol
      instance.

   The method of generation of the points {P,Q_1,Q_2,...,Q_N} is
   described in Section 6.

   The protocol parameters that are used by subject A are the following:

   1.  The secret password value PW, which is a byte string that is
       uniformly randomly chosen from a subset of cardinality 10^10 or
       greater of the set B_k, where k >= 6 is password length.

   2.  The list of curve identifiers supported by A.

   3.  Sets of points {Q_1,Q_2,...,Q_N}, corresponding to curves
       supported by A.

   4.  The C_1^A counter, that tracks the total number of unsuccessful
       authentication trials in a row, and a value of CLim_1 that stores
       the maximum possible number of such events.

   5.  The C_2^A counter, that tracks the total number of unsuccessful
       authentication events during the period of usage of the specific
       PW, and a value of CLim_2 that stores the maximum possible number
       of such events.

Internet-Draft                   SESPAKE                        May 2016


   6.  The C_3^A counter, that tracks the total number of authentication
       events (successful and unsuccessful) during the period of usage
       of the specific PW, and a value of CLim_3 that stores the maximum
       possible number of such events.  The identifier ID_A of subject A
       (optional), a byte string of an arbitrary length.

   7.  The unique identifier ID_A of the subject A (optional, see.  Note
       2), which is a byte string of an arbitrary length.

   The protocol parameters that are used by subject B are the following:

   1.  The values ind and salt, where ind is in {1,...,N}, salt is in
       {1,...,2^128-1}.

   2.  The point Q_PW, satisfying the following equation:

          Q_PW = int (F (PW, salt, 2000))*Q_ind.

       It is possible that the point Q_PW is not stored and is
       calculated using PW in the beginning of the protocol.  In that
       case B has to store PW and points Q_1,Q_2,...,Q_N.

   3.  The ID_ALG identifier of the elliptic curve used in the protocol.

   4.  The C_1^B counter, that tracks the total number of unsuccessful
       authentication trials in a row, and a value of CLim_1 that stores
       the maximum possible number of such events.

   5.  The C_2^B counter, that tracks the total number of unsuccessful
       authentication events during the period of usage of the specific
       PW, and a value of CLim_2 that stores the maximum possible number
       of such events.

   6.  The C_3^B counter, that tracks the total number of authentication
       events (successful and unsuccessful) during the period of usage
       of the specific PW, and a value of CLim_3 that stores the maximum
       possible number of such events.  The identifier ID_B of subject B
       (optional), a byte string of an arbitrary length.

   7.  The unique identifier ID_B of the subject B (optional, see.  Note
       2), which is a byte string of an arbitrary length.

5.2.  Initial values of the protocol counters

   After the setup of a new password value PW the values of the counters
   must be assigned as follows:

   o  C_1^A = C_1^B = CLim_1, where CLim_1 is in {3,...,5};



Smyshlyaev, et al.      Expires November 6, 2016                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                   SESPAKE                        May 2016


   o  C_2^A = C_2^B = CLim_2, where CLim_2 is in {7,...,20};

   o  C_3^A = C_3^B = CLim_3, where CLim_3 is in {10^3,10^3+1,...,10^5}.

5.3.  Protocol steps

   The described protocol consists of the following steps:

   1.   If any of the counters C_1^A, C_2^A, C_3^A is equal to 0, A
        finishes the protocol with an error that informs of exceeding
        the number of trials that is controlled by the corresponding
        counter.

   2.   A decrements each of the counters C_1^A, C_2^A, C_3^A by 1,
        requests open authentication information from B and sends the
        ID_A identifier.

   3.   If any of the counters C_1^B, C_2^B, C_3^B is equal to 0, B
        finishes the protocol with an error that informs of exceeding
        the number of trials that is controlled by the corresponding
        counter.

   4.   B decrements each of the counters C_1^B, C_2^B, C_3^B by 1.

   5.   B sends the values of ind, salt and the ID_ALG identifier to A.
        B also can OPTIONALLY send the ID_B identifier to A.  All
        following calculations are done by B in the elliptic curve group
        defined by the ID_ALG identifier.

   6.   A sets the curve defined by the received ID_ALG identifier as
        the used elliptic curve.  All following calculations are done by
        A in this elliptic curve group.

   7.   A calculates the point Q_PW^A = int (F (PW, salt, 2000))*Q_ind.

   8.   A chooses randomly (according to the uniform distribution) the
        value alpha, alpha is in {1,...,q-1}, and assigns z_A = 0.

   9.   A sends the value u_1 = alpha*P - Q_PW^A to B.

   10.  After receiving u_1, B checks that u_1 is in E.  If it is not, B
        finishes with an error, considering the authentication process
        unsuccessful.

   11.  B calculates Q_B = u_1 + Q_PW, assigns z_B = 0 and chooses
        randomly (according to the uniform distribution) the value
        betta, betta is in {1,...,q-1}.

   12.  If m/q*Q_B = O, B assigns Q_B = P and z_B = 1.

   13.  B calculates K_B = HASH (( m/q*betta*(mod q))*Q_B ), where the
        input of a hash function is a little-endian representation of
        the obtained point (x-coordinate first, then y-coordinate).

   14.  B sends the value u_2 = betta*P + Q_PW to A.

   15.  After receiving u_2, A checks that u_2 is in E.  If it is not, A
        finishes with an error, considering the authentication process
        unsuccessful.

   16.  A calculates Q_A = u_2 - Q_PW^A.

   17.  If m/q*Q_A = O, then A assigns Q_A = P and z_A = 1.

   18.  A calculates K_A = HASH (( m/q*alpha(mod q))*Q_A ), where the
        input of a hash function is a little-endian representation of
        the obtained point (x-coordinate first, then y-coordinate).

   19.  A calculates MAC_A = HMAC (K_A, 0x01 || ID_A || ind || salt ||
        u_1 || u_2 || DATA_A), where DATA_A is an optional string that
        is authenticated with MAC_A (if it is not used, then DATA_A is
        considered to be of zero length).

   20.  A sends (DATA_A || MAC_A) to B.

   21.  B checks that the values MAC_A and HMAC (K_B, 0x01 || ID_A ||
        ind || salt || u_1 || u_2 || DATA_A) are equal.  If they are
        not, it finishes with an error, considering the authentication
        process unsuccessful.

   22.  If z_B = 1, B finishes, considering the authentication process
        unsuccessful.

   23.  B sets the value of C_1^B to CLim_1 and increases C_2^B by 1.

   24.  B calculates MAC_B = HMAC(K_B, 0x02 || ID_B || ind || salt ||
        u_1 || u_2 || DATA_A || DATA_B), where DATA_B is an optional
        string that is authenticated with MAC_B (if it is not used, then
        DATA_B is considered to be of zero length).

   25.  B sends (DATA_B || MAC_B) to A.

   26.  A checks that the values MAC_B and HMAC (K_A, 0x02 || ID_B ||
        ind || salt || u_1 || u_2 || DATA_A || DATA_B) are equal.  If
        they are not, it finishes with an error, considering the
        authentication process unsuccessful.

   27.  If z_A = 1, A finishes, considering the authentication process
        unsuccessful.

   28.  A sets the value of C_1^A to CLim_1 and increases C_2^A by 1.

   After the successful finish of the procedure the subjects A and B are
   mutually authenticated and each subject has an explicitly
   authenticated value of K = K_A = K_B.

   N o t e:

   1.  In the case where the interaction process can be initiated by any
       subject (client or server) the ID_A and ID_B options MUST be used
       and the resiver MUST check that the identifier he had received is
       not equal to his own, otherwise, it finishes the protocol.  If an
       optional parameter ID_A (or ID_B) is not used in the protocol, it
       SHOULD be considered equal to a fixed byte string (zero-length
       string is allowed) defined by a specific implementation.

   2.  The ind, ID_A, ID_B and salt parameters can be agreed in advance.
       If some parameter is agreed in advance, it is possible not to
       send it during a corresponding step.  Nevertheless, all
       parameters MUST be used as corresponding inputs to HMAC function
       during stages 19, 21, 24 and 26.

   3.  The ID_ALG parameter can be fixed or agreed in advance.

   4.  Continuation of protocol interaction in case of any of the
       counters C_1^A, C_1^B being equal to zero MAY be done without
       changing password.  In this case these counters can be used for
       protection against denial-of-service attacks.  For example,
       continuation of interaction can be allowed after a certain delay.

   5.  Continuation of protocol interaction in case of any of the
       counters C_2^A, C_3^A, C_2^B, C_3^B being equal to zero MUST be
       done only after changing password.

6.  Construction of points Q_1,...,Q_N

   This section provides an example of possible algorithm for generation
   of each point Q_i in the set {Q_1,...,Q_N} that corresponds to the
   given elliptic curve E.

   The akgorithm is based on choosing points with coordinates with a
   known preimages of a cryptographic hash function H, which is the GOST
   R 34.11-2012 hash function (see [RFC6986]) with 256-bit output, if
   2^254 < q < 2^256, and the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function (see
   [RFC6986]) with 512-bit output , if 2^508 < q < 2^512.

   The algorithm consists of the following steps:

   1.  Choose an arbitrary SEED value with length of 32 bytes or more.

   2.  Calculate X = INT (H (SEED)) mod p.

   3.  Check that the value of X^3 + aX + b is a quadratic residue in
       the field F_p.  If it is not, return to Step 1.

   4.  Choose the value of Y arbitrarily from the set
       {+sqrt(A),-sqrt(A)}, where A = X^3 + aX + b.  Here sqrt(A) is an
       element of F_p, for which (sqrt(A))^2 = A mod p.

   5.  Check that for point Q = (X,Y) the following relations hold: Q !=
       O and q*Q = O.  If they do not, return to Step 1.

   With the defined algorithm for any elliptic curve E point sets
   {Q_1,...,Q_N} are constructed.  Constructed points in one set MUST
   have distinct x-coordinates.

   N o t e: The knowledge of hash function preimage prevents knowledge
   of the multiplicity of any point related to generator point P.  It is
   of primary importance, because such a knowledge could be used to
   implement an attack against protocol with exhaustive search of
   password.

8.  Security Considerations

   Any cryptographic algorithms, particularly HASH function and HMAC
   function, that are used in the SESPAKE protocol MUST be carefully
   designed and MUST be able to withstand all known types of
   cryptanalytic attack.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the HASH function satisfies the following
   condition:
   hashlen <= log_2(q) + 4, where hashlen is the the lenghts of the HASH
   function output.

   The output lenghths of hash functions that are used in the SESPAKE
   protocol is RECOMMENDED to be greater or equal to 256 bits.

   The points Q_1, Q_2,... Q_3 and P must be chosen in such a way that
   they are provable pseudorandomness.  As a practical matter, this

   means that the algorithm for generation of each point Q_i in the set
   {Q_1,...,Q_N} (see Section 6) ensures that multiplicity of any point
   under any other point is unknown.

Appendix A.  Test examples for GOST-based protocol implementation

   The following test examples are made for the protocol implementation
   that is based on the Russian national standards GOST R 34.10-2012
   [GOST3410-2012] and GOST R 34.11-2012 [GOST3411-2012].  The English
   versions of these standards can be found in [RFC7091] and [RFC6986].

A.1.  Examples of points

   There are three points (Q_1, Q_2, Q_3) for each of the elliptic
   curves below.  This points were constructed using the method
   described in Section 6, where the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function
   (see [RFC6986]) with 256-bit output is used if 2^254 < q < 2^256 and
   the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function (see [RFC6986]) with 512-bit
   output is used if 2^508 < q < 2^512.

   The same method should be used for constructing, if necessary,
   additional points.  Each of the points complies with the GOST R
   34.10-2012 [GOST3410-2012] standard and is represented by a pair of
   (X, Y) coordinates in the canonical form and by a pair of (U, V)
   coordinates in the twisted Edward form in accordance with the
   document [RFC7836] for the curves that have the equivalent
   representation in this form.  There is a SEED value for each point,
   by which it was generated.

A.2.  Test examples

   This protocol implementation uses the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function
   (see [RFC6986]) with 256-bit output as the H function and the
   HMAC_GOSTR3411_2012_512 function defined in [RFC7836] as a PRF
   function for the F function.  The parameter len is considered equal
   to 256, if 2^254 < q < 2^256, and equal to 512, if 2^508 < q < 2^512.

   The test examples for one of the three points of each curve in
   Appendix A.1 of this document are given below.
