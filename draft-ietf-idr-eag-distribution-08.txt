         Distribution of MPLS-TE Extended admin Group Using BGP
                   draft-ietf-idr-eag-distribution-08

Abstract

   As MPLS-TE network grows, administrative Groups advertised as a
   fixed-length 32-bit Bitmask is quite constraining.  "Extended
   Administrative Group" IGP TE extensions sub-TLV is introduced to
   provide for additional administrative groups (link colors) beyond the
   current limit of 32.  This document describes extensions to BGP
   protocol, that can be used to distribute extended administrative
   groups in MPLS-TE.

1.  Introduction

   MPLS-TE advertises 32 administrative groups (commonly referred to as
   "colors" or "link colors") using the Administrative Group sub-TLV of
   the Link TLV defined in OSPFv2 (RFC3630), OSPFv3 (RFC5329) and ISIS
   (RFC5305).

   As MPLS-TE network grows, administrative Groups advertised as a
   fixed-length 32-bit Bitmask is quite constraining.  "Extended
   Administrative Group" IGP TE extensions sub-TLV defined in [RFC7308]
   is introduced to provide for additional administrative groups (link
   colors) beyond the current limit of 32.

   TThis document defines a new TLV to be carried within BGP-LS
   attribute (defined in [I.D-ietf- idr-ls-distribution]) to distribute
   extended administrative groups in MPLS-TE.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Carrying Extended Administrative Groups in BGP

   This document proposes one new BGP link attribute TLVs that can be
   announced as attribute in the BGP-LS attribute (defined in [I.D-ietf-
   idr-ls-distribution]) to distribute extended administrative groups.

Internet-Draft            Extended admin Group              October 2018


   The extensions in this document build on the ones provided in BGP-LS
   [RFC7752] and BGP-4 [RFC4271].

   BGP-LS attribute defined in [RFC7752] has nested TLVs which allow the
   BGP-LS attribute to be readily extended.  Link attribute TLVs defined
   in section 3.2.2 of [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution]are TLVs that may
   be encoded in the BGP-LS attribute with a link NLRI.  Each 'Link
   Attribute' is a Type/Length/ Value (TLV) triplet formatted as defined
   in Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].

   This document proposes one new TLV as a link attribute:

         Type            Value

         TBD1        Extended Administrative Group (EAG)


   The EAG TLV is used in addition to the Administrative Groups when a
   node wants to advertise more than 32 colors for a link.  The EAG TLV
   is optional.  The format and semantics of the 'value' fields in EAG
   TLVs correspond to the format and semantics of value fields in IGP
   extension sub-TLVs, defined in [RFC7308].

   +------------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------+
   |  TLV Code  |     Description     |     IS-IS    |   Defined in:   |
   |    Point   |                     |  TLV/Sub-TLV |                 |
   +------------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------+
   |    TBD1    |       Extended      |     22/14    |    [RFC7308]    |
   |            |Admininstrative Group|              |                 |
   +------------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------+

                     Table 1: 'EAG' Link Attribute TLV

3.1.  AG and EAG coexistence

   Similar to section 2.3.1 of [RFC7308],if a BGP speaker advertises
   both AG and EAG then AG and EAG should be dealt with in the same way
   as AG and EAG carried in the Extended Administrative Group (EAG) sub-
   TLV [RFC7308] for both OSPF [RFC3630] and ISIS [RFC5305].

3.2.  Desire for unadvertised EAG bits

   Unlike AGs, EAGs are advertised as any non-zero-length-bit Bitmask.
   the EAG length may be longer for some links than for others.  Similar
   to section 2.3.2 of [RFC7308], if a BGP peer wants to only use links
   where the specific bits of an EAG is set to 1 but the specific bits
   of this EAG is not advertised, then the implementation SHOULD process

   these desire and unadvertised EAG bits in accordance with rule
   defined in section 2.3.2 of [RFC7308].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC7752] and [RFC4271].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning code-points from the registry "BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs" for the new Link Attribute TLVs defined in the table above:
