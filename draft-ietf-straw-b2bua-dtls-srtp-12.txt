1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   [RFC5763] describes how Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]
   can be used to establish a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   [RFC3711] security context with the Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) [RFC6347] protocol.  It describes a mechanism for transporting
   a certificate fingerprint using Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566].  The fingerprint identifies the certificate that will be
   presented during the DTLS handshake.  DTLS-SRTP is currently defined
   for point-to-point media sessions, in which there are exactly two
   participants.  Each DTLS-SRTP session (described in Section 3 of
   [RFC5764]) contains a single DTLS connection (if RTP and RTCP are
   multiplexed) or two DTLS connections (if RTP and RTCP are not
   multiplexed), and either two SRTP contexts (if media traffic is

   flowing in both directions on the same 5-tuple) or one SRTP context
   (if media traffic is only flowing in one direction).

   In many SIP deployments, SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUA)
   entities exist on the SIP signaling path between the endpoints.  As
   described in [RFC7092], these B2BUAs can modify SIP and SDP
   information.  For example, as described in Section 3.1.3 of
   [RFC7092], SDP-modifying signaling-only B2BUAs can potentially modify
   the SDP.  B2BUAs can also be present on the media path, in which case
   they modify parts of the SDP information (like IP address, port) and
   subsequently modify the RTP headers as well.  Such B2BUAs are
   referred to as media plane B2BUAs.  [RFC7092] describes two different
   categories of media plane B2BUAs, according to the level of
   activities performed on the media plane.

   When B2BUAs are present in a call between two SIP User Agents (UAs)
   they often make end-to-end DTLS-SRTP sessions impossible.  End-to-end
   DTLS-SRTP session means that man-in-middle devices cannot break the
   DTLS-SRTP session between the endpoints.  In other words, the man-in-
   middle device cannot create a separate DTLS-SRTP session between the
   client and the middle device, on one side, and the middle device and
   the remote peer on the other side.  B2BUAs may be deployed for
   address hiding or media latching [RFC7362], although TURN (and ICE)
   is expected to be used more often for this purpose as it provides
   better security properties.  Such B2BUAs are able to perform their
   functions without requiring termination of DTLS-SRTP sessions i.e.
   these B2BUAs need not act as DTLS proxy and decrypt the RTP payload.

1.2.  Goals and Scope of this Document

   A B2BUA could be deployed for address hiding or media latching, as
   described in [RFC7362].  Such B2BUAs only terminate the media plane
   at the IP and transport (UDP/TCP) layers and may inspect the RTP
   headers or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets.  The goal of this
   specification is to provide guidance on how such B2BUAs function
   without breaking the end-to-end DTLS-SRTP session.  A B2BUA could
   also terminate the media or modify the RTP headers or RTP Control
   Protocol (RTCP) packets.  Such B2BUAs will not allow end-to-end DTLS-
   SRTP.  The recommendations made in this document are not expected to
   be applied by B2BUAs terminating DTLS-SRTP sessions given deployment
   reality.

   This specification assumes that a B2BUA is not providing identity
   assurance and is not authorized to terminate the DTLS-SRTP session.
   A B2BUA that provides identity assurance on behalf of endpoints
   behind it can modify any portion of SIP and SDP before it generates
   the identity signature.  As the B2BUA is generating the identity
   signature it is not possible to detect if a B2BUA has terminated the

   DTLS-SRTP session.  B2BUAs providing identity assurance and
   terminating DTLS-SRTP session are out of scope of this document.

   The following sections describe the behavior B2BUAs can follow to
   avoid breaking end-to-end DTLS-SRTP sessions.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Transport Address: The combination of an IP address and port number.

   The following generalized terms are defined in [RFC3261], Section 6.

      B2BUA: a SIP Back-to-Back User Agent, which is the logical
      combination of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client
      (UAC).

      UAS: a SIP User Agent Server.

      UAC: a SIP User Agent Client.

   All of the pertinent B2BUA terminology and taxonomy used in this
   document is based on [RFC7092].

   It is assumed the reader is already familiar with the fundamental
   concepts of the RTP protocol [RFC3550] and its taxonomy [RFC7656], as
   well as those of SRTP [RFC3711], and DTLS [RFC6347].

3.  B2BUAs Procedures to Allow End-to-End DTLS-SRTP

   A B2BUA MUST follow the rules mentioned below to allow end-to-end
   DTLS-SRTP session.

   1.  B2BUAs MUST forward the certificate fingerprint and SDP setup
       attribute it receives from one endpoint unmodified towards the
       other endpoint and vice-versa.

   2.  [RFC4474] provides a means for signing portions of SIP requests
       in order to provide identity assurance and certificate pinning by
       providing an identity signature over the SDP that carries the
       fingerprint of keying for DTLS-SRTP [RFC5763].  B2BUAs can
       identify that [RFC4474] is used for identity assurance if the SIP
       request contains both Identity and Identity-Info headers.  In
       cases where endpoints use [RFC4474], B2BUAs MUST ensure that it
       does not modify any of the information used to construct the



Ravindranath, et al.     Expires October 6, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       DTLS-SRTP Handling in SIP B2BUA          April 2016


       identity signature.  This includes the entire SDP body and
       portions of SIP header as described in [RFC4474].  In this case,
       a B2BUA cannot act as a media relay B2BUA.

   3.  [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] is introduced to overcome the
       limitations of [RFC4474] (discussed in Section 1 of
       [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis]).  Unlike [RFC4474],
       [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] does not generate identity signature
       over material that intermediaries in the field commonly alter.
       In this case, a B2BUA can act as a media relay B2BUA.  B2BUAs can
       identify that [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] is used for identity
       assurance if the SIP request contains an Identity header but does
       not include an Identity-Info header.  The Identity-Info header is
       deprecated in [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis].  A B2BUA MUST ensure
       that it does not modify any of the headers used to construct the
       identity signature.

   4.  Both media relays and media-aware relays MUST NOT modify the
       authenticated portion of RTP and RTCP packets, and MUST NOT
       modify the authentication tag in the RTP and RTCP packets.

4.  Signaling Plane B2BUA Handling of DTLS-SRTP

   Section 3.1 of [RFC7092] describes different categories of signaling
   plane B2BUAs.  This section explains how these B2BUAs are expected to
   comply with the recommendations in Section 3.

4.1.  Proxy-B2BUAs

   Proxy-B2BUAs, as defined in Section 3.1.1 of [RFC7092], modify only
   the Via and Record-Route SIP headers.  These B2BUAs can continue to
   perform their function and still allow end-to-end DTLS-SRTP sessions
   since it does not modify any of the headers used to construct the
   identity signature.

4.2.  Signaling-only and SDP-modifying Signaling-only B2BUAs

   These categories of B2BUAs are likely to modify headers that are used
   to construct the identity signature.  For example, a signaling-only
   B2BUA can modify the Contact URI.  Such B2BUAs are likely to violate
   rule 2 or rule 3 in Section 3.  Depending upon the application
   requirements, such a B2BUA may be able to limit modification of
   header fields to those allowed to be modified by [RFC4474] or
   [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis].

5.  Media Plane B2BUA Handling of DTLS-SRTP

5.1.  General

   This section describes how the different types of media plane B2BUAs
   defined in [RFC7092] are expected to comply with the recommendations
   in Section 3.

5.1.1.  Media Relay

   A media relay, as defined in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC7092], from an
   application layer point-of-view, forwards all packets it receives on
   a negotiated connection, without inspecting or modifying the packet
   contents.  A media relay only modifies the transport layer (UDP/TCP)
   and IP headers.

   A media relay B2BUA follows the rule 1 mentioned in Section 3 and
   forwards the certificate fingerprint and SDP setup attribute it
   receives from one endpoint unmodified towards the other endpoint and
   vice-versa.  The example below shows a SIP call establishment flow,
   with both SIP endpoints (user agents) using DTLS-SRTP, and a media
   relay B2BUA.

         Figure 1: INVITE with SDP call-flow for Media Relay B2BUA

   NOTE: For brevity the entire value of the SDP fingerprint attribute
   is not shown.  The example here shows only one DTLS connection for
   the sake of simplicity.  In reality depending on whether the RTP and
   RTCP flows are multiplexed or demultiplexed there will be one or two
   DTLS connections.

Internet-Draft       DTLS-SRTP Handling in SIP B2BUA          April 2016


   If RTP and RTCP traffic is multiplexed as described in [RFC5761] on a
   single port then only a single DTLS connection is required between
   the peers.  If RTP and RTCP are not multiplexed, then the peers would
   have to establish two DTLS connections.  In this case, Bob, after he
   receives an INVITE request, triggers the establishment of a DTLS
   connection.  Note that the DTLS handshake and the sending of INVITE
   response can happen in parallel; thus, the B2BUA has to be prepared
   to receive DTLS, STUN and media on the ports it advertised to Bob in
   the SDP offer before it receives a SDP answer from Bob. Since a media
   relay B2BUA does not differentiate between a DTLS message, RTP or any
   packet it receives, it only changes the transport layer (UDP/TCP) and
   IP headers and forwards the packet towards the other endpoint.  The
   B2BUA cannot decrypt the RTP payload as the payload is encrypted
   using the SRTP keys derived from the DTLS connection setup between
   Alice and Bob.

   If the endpoints use [RFC4474], a B2BUA cannot function as a media-
   relay without violating rule 2 in Section 3.  If [4474bis] is used, a
   B2BUA can modify the IP address in the c= line and the port in the m=
   line, as shown in Figure 1, as long as it does not otherwise violate
   rule 3 in Section 3.

5.1.2.  RTP/RTCP-Aware Media-Aware B2BUA

   Unlike the media relay discussed in Section 5.1.1, a media-aware
   relay as defined in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7092], is aware of the type
   of media traffic it is receiving.  There are two types of media-aware
   relays, those that merely inspect the RTP headers and unencrypted
   portions of RTCP packets, and those that inspect and modify the RTP
   headers and unencrypted portions of RTCP packets.

5.1.2.1.  RTP Header and RTCP Packets Inspection

   A RTP/RTCP aware media relay does not modify the RTP headers and RTCP
   packets but only inspects the packets.  Such B2BUAs follow rule 4 in
   Section 3 and can continue to do their function while allowing end-
   to-end DTLS-SRTP.  Inspection by the B2BUA will not reveal the clear-
   text for encrypted parts of the SRTP/SRTCP packets.

5.1.2.2.  RTP Header and RTCP Packet Modification

   A B2BUA cannot modify RTP headers or RTCP packets, as to do so it
   would need to act as a DTLS endpoint, terminate the DTLS-SRTP session
   and decrypt/re-encrypt RTP packets.  If a B2BUA modifies unencrypted
   or encrypted portions of the RTP or RTCP packets then the integrity
   check will fail and the packet will be dropped by the endpoint.  The
   unencrypted and encrypted portions of the RTP or RTCP packets are
   integrity protected using the HMAC algorithm negotiated during DTLS

   handshake (discussed in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5764]).  B2BUAs have to
   follow the rules in Section 3 to avoid breaking integrity of SRTP/
   SRTCP streams.

6.  Forking Considerations

   Due to forking [RFC3261], a SIP request carrying an SDP offer sent by
   an endpoint (offerer) can reach multiple remote endpoints.  As a
   result, multiple DTLS-SRTP sessions can be established, one between
   the endpoint that sent the SIP request and each of the remote
   endpoints that received the request.  B2BUAs have to follow rule 1 in
   Section 3 while handling offer/answer and forward the certificate
   fingerprints and SDP setup attributes it received in the SDP answer
   from each endpoint (answerer) unmodified towards the offerer.  Since
   each DTLS connection is setup on a unique 5-tuple, B2BUA replaces the
   answerer's transport addresses in each answer with its unique
   transport addresses so that the offerer can establish a DTLS
   connection with each answerer.  The B2BUA acting as a media relay
   here follows rule 4 mentioned in Section 3.

                                             Bob (192.0.2.1:6666)
                                            /
                                           /
                                          / DTLS-SRTP=XXX
                                         /
                                        /

                         <----------->  (192.0.2.3:8888)
                         DTLS-SRTP=YYY ^
                                        \
                                         \  DTLS-SRTP=YYY
                                          \
                                           \

                                             Charlie (192.0.2.2:6666)

                 Figure 2: B2BUA handling multiple answers

   For instance, as shown in Figure 2 Alice sends a request with an
   offer, and the request is forked.  Alice receives answers from both
   Bob and Charlie.  The B2BUA advertises different B2BUA transport
   address in each answer, as shown in Figure2, where XXX and YYY
   represent different DTLS-SRTP sessions.  The B2BUA replaces Bob's
   transport address (192.0.2.1:6666) in the answer with its transport
   address (192.0.2.3:7777) and Charlie's transport address
   (192.0.2.2:6666) in the answer with its transport address

   (192.0.2.3:8888).  The B2BUA tracks the remote sources (Bob and
   Charlie) and associates them to the local sources that are used to
   send packets to Alice.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the behavior B2BUAs must follow to avoid
   breaking end-to-end DTLS-SRTP.  Media relays that modify RTP or RTCP,
   or modify SIP header fields or SDP fields that are protected by the
   identity signature, are incompatible with end-to-end DTLS-SRTP.  Such
   relays are out of scope for this document.  Security considerations
   discussed in [RFC5763] are also applicable to this document.  In
   addition, the B2BUA behaviors outlined in this document do not impact
   the security and integrity of a DTLS-SRTP session or the data
   exchanged over it.  A malicious B2BUA can try to break into the DTLS
   connection, but such an attack can be prevented using the identity
   validation mechanism discussed in [RFC4474] or
   [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis].  Either the endpoints or authentication
   service proxies involved in the call can use the identity validation
   mechanisms discussed in [RFC4474] or [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] to
   validate the identity of peers and detect malicious B2BUA's that can
   attempt to terminate the DTLS connection to decrypt the RTP payload.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
