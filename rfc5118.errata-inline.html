1.  Overview

   This document is informational, and is *not normative* on any aspect
   of SIP.

   This document contains test messages based on the current version
   (2.0) of the Session Initiation Protocol as defined in [RFC3261].

   This document is expected to be used as a companion document to the
   more general SIP torture test document [RFC4475], which does not
   include specific tests for IPv6 network identifiers.

   This document does not attempt to catalog every way to make an
   invalid message, nor does it attempt to be comprehensive in exploring
   unusual, but valid, messages.  Instead, it tries to focus on areas
   that may cause interoperability problems in IPv6 deployments.

2.  Document Conventions

   This document contains many examples of SIP messages with IPv6
   network identifiers.  The appendix contains an encoded binary form
   containing the bit-exact representation of all the messages and the
   script needed to decode them into separate files.

   The IPv6 addresses used in this document correspond to the 2001:
   DB8::/32 address prefix reserved for documentation [RFC3489].
   Likewise, the IPv4 addresses used in this document correspond to the
   192.0.2.0/24 address block as described in [RFC3330].

   Although SIP is a text-based protocol, some of these examples cannot
   be unambiguously rendered without additional markup due to the
   constraints placed on the formatting of RFCs.  This document uses the
   &lt;allOneLine/&gt; markup convention established in [RFC4475] to avoid
   ambiguity and meet the Internet-Draft layout requirements.  For the
   sake of completeness, the text defining this markup from Section 2.1
   of [RFC4475] is reproduced in its entirety below:

      Several of these examples contain unfolded lines longer than 72
      characters.  These are captured between &lt;allOneLine/&gt; tags.  The
      single unfolded line is reconstructed by directly concatenating
      all lines appearing between the tags (discarding any line feeds or
      carriage returns).  There will be no whitespace at the end of
      lines.  Any whitespace appearing at a fold-point will appear at
      the beginning of a line.

      The following represent the same string of bits:

      Header-name: first value, reallylongsecondvalue, third value

         &lt;allOneLine&gt;
         Header-name: first value,
          reallylongsecondvalue
         , third value
         &lt;/allOneLine&gt;

         &lt;allOneLine&gt;
         Header-name: first value,
          reallylong
         second
         value,
          third value
         &lt;/allOneLine&gt;

      Note that this is NOT SIP header-line folding, where different
      strings of bits have equivalent meaning.

3.  SIP and IPv6 Network Configuration

   System-level issues like deploying a dual-stack proxy server,
   populating DNS with A and AAAA Resource Records (RRs), zero-
   configuration discovery of outbound proxies for IPv4 and IPv6
   networks, when a dual-stack proxy should Record-Route itself, and
   media issues also play a major part in the transition to IPv6.  This
   document does not, however, address these issues.  Instead, a
   companion document [sip-trans] provides more guidance on these
   issues.

4.  Parser Torture Tests

   The test messages are organized into several sections.  Some stress
   only the SIP parser and others stress both the parser and the
   application above it.  Some messages are valid and some are not.
   Each example clearly calls out what makes any invalid messages
   incorrect.

   Please refer to the complete Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) in
   [RFC3261] on representing IPv6 references in SIP messages.  IPv6
   references are delimited by a &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;.  When an IPv6 reference is
   part of a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), RFC 3261 mandates
   that the &quot;IPv6reference&quot; production rule be used to recognize tokens
   that comprise an IPv6 reference.  More specifically, the ABNF states
   the following:

     SIP-URI        =  &quot;sip:&quot; [ userinfo ] hostport
                       uri-parameters [ headers ]
     hostport       =  host [ &quot;:&quot; port ]
     host           =  hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
     IPv4address    =  1*3DIGIT &quot;.&quot; 1*3DIGIT &quot;.&quot; 1*3DIGIT &quot;.&quot; 1*3DIGIT
     IPv6reference  =  &quot;[&quot; IPv6address &quot;]&quot;
     IPv6address    =  hexpart [ &quot;:&quot; IPv4address ]
     hexpart        =  hexseq / hexseq &quot;::&quot; [ hexseq ] / &quot;::&quot; [ hexseq ]
     hexseq         =  hex4 *( &quot;:&quot; hex4)
     hex4           =  1*4HEXDIG

4.1.  Valid SIP Message with an IPv6 Reference

   The request below is well-formatted according to the grammar in
   [RFC3261].  An IPv6 reference appears in the Request-URI (R-URI), Via
   header field, and Contact header field.

   Message Details: ipv6-good

      REGISTER sip:[2001:db8::10] SIP/2.0
      To: sip:user@example.com
      From: sip:user@example.com;tag=81x2
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP [2001:db8::9:1];branch=z9hG4bKas3-111
      Call-ID: SSG9559905523997077@hlau_4100
      Max-Forwards: 70
      Contact: &quot;Caller&quot; &lt;sip:caller@[2001:db8::1]&gt;
      CSeq: 98176 REGISTER
      Content-Length: 0

4.2.  Invalid SIP Message with an IPv6 Reference

   The request below is not well-formatted according to the grammar in
   [RFC3261].  The IPv6 reference in the R-URI does not contain the
   mandated delimiters for an IPv6 reference (&quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;).

   A SIP implementation receiving this request should respond with a 400
   Bad Request error.

   Message Details: ipv6-bad

      REGISTER sip:2001:db8::10 SIP/2.0
      To: sip:user@example.com

      CSeq: 98176 REGISTER
      Content-Length: 0

4.3.  Port Ambiguous in a SIP URI

<div class='Verified-endnote-styling' id='eid1311'>
<pre>
<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid1311'>EID 1311</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 4.3, 1st par

<b>Original Text:</b>

                                                  [...], the intended port
   number becomes the last octet of the reference.

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

                                                  [...], the intended port
   number becomes the last octet pair of the reference.
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
Each hexadecimal group in a literal IPv6 address encodes two octets<br/>of the IPv6 address -- cf. RFC 4291 !
</div>
   IPv6 uses the colon to delimit octets.  This may lead to ambiguity if
   the port number on which to contact a SIP server is inadvertently
   conflated with the IPv6 reference.  Consider the REGISTER request
   below.  The sender of the request intended to specify a port number
   (5070) to contact a server, but inadvertently, inserted the port
   number inside the closing &quot;]&quot; of the IPv6 reference.  Unfortunately,
   since the IPv6 address in the R-URI is compressed, the intended port
   number becomes the last octet of the reference.

   From a parsing perspective, the request below is well-formed.
   However, from a semantic point of view, it will not yield the desired
   result.  Implementations must ensure that when a raw IPv6 address
   appears in a SIP URI, then a port number, if required, appears
   outside the closing &quot;]&quot; delimiting the IPv6 reference.  Raw IPv6
   addresses can occur in many header fields, including the Contact,
   Route, and Record-Route header fields.  They also can appear as the
   result of the &quot;sent-by&quot; production rule of the Via header field.
   Implementers are urged to consult the ABNF in [RFC3261] for a
   complete list of fields where a SIP URI can appear.

   Message Details: port-ambiguous

      To: sip:user@example.com
      From: sip:user@example.com;tag=81x2

      CSeq: 98176 REGISTER
      Content-Length: 0

4.4.  Port Unambiguous in a SIP URI

   In contrast to the example in Section 4.3, the following REGISTER
   request leaves no ambiguity whatsoever on where the IPv6 address ends
   and the port number begins.  This REGISTER request is well formatted
   per the grammar in [RFC3261].

   Message Details: port-unambiguous

      REGISTER sip:[2001:db8::10]:5070 SIP/2.0
      To: sip:user@example.com
      From: sip:user@example.com;tag=81x2

      Max-Forwards: 70
      CSeq: 98176 REGISTER
      Content-Length: 0

4.5.  IPv6 Reference Delimiters in Via Header

   IPv6 references can also appear in Via header fields; more
   specifically in the &quot;sent-by&quot; production rule and the &quot;via-received&quot;
   production rule.  In the &quot;sent-by&quot; production rule, the sequence of
   octets comprising the IPv6 address is defined to appear as an
   &quot;IPv6reference&quot; non-terminal, thereby mandating the &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;
   delimiters.  However, this is not the case for the &quot;via-received&quot;
   non-terminal.  The &quot;via-received&quot; production rule is defined as
   follows:

      via-received = &quot;received&quot; EQUAL (IPv4address / IPv6address)

   The &quot;IPv6address&quot; non-terminal is defined not to include the
   delimiting &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;.  This has led to the situation documented
   during the 18th SIP Interoperability Event [Email-SIPit]:

      Those testing IPv6 made different assumptions about enclosing
      literal v6 addresses in Vias in [].  By the end of the event, most
      implementations were accepting either.  Its about 50/50 on what
      gets sent.

   While it would be beneficial if the same non-terminal
   (&quot;IPv6reference&quot;) was used for both the &quot;sent-by&quot; and &quot;via-received&quot;
   production rules, there has not been a consensus in the working group
   to that effect.  Thus, the best that can be suggested is that
   implementations must follow the Robustness Principle [RFC1122] and be
   liberal in accepting a &quot;received&quot; parameter with or without the

   delimiting &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; tokens.  When sending a request,
   implementations must not put the delimiting &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; tokens.

   The two test cases below are designed to stress this behavior.  A SIP
   implementation receiving either of these messages must parse them
   successfully.

   The request below contains an IPv6 address in the Via &quot;received&quot;
   parameter.  The IPv6 address is delimited by &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;.  Even
   though this is not a valid request based on a strict interpretation
   of the grammar in [RFC3261], robust implementations must nonetheless
   be able to parse the topmost Via header field and continue processing
   the request.

4.9.  IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Addresses

   An IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is usually represented with the last 32
   bits appearing as a dotted-decimal IPv4 address; e.g., ::ffff:
   192.0.2.1.  A SIP implementation receiving a message that contains
   such a mapped address must be prepared to parse it successfully.  An
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address may appear in signaling, or in the SDP
   carried by the signaling message, or in both.  If a port number is
   part of the URI represented by the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, then it
   must appear outside the delimiting &quot;]&quot; (cf. Section 4.4).

   The message below is well-formed according to the grammar in
   [RFC3261].  The Via list contains two Via headers, both of which
   include an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.  An IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   also appears in the Contact header and the SDP.  The topmost Via
   header includes a port number that is appropriately delimited by &quot;]&quot;.

4.10.  IPv6 Reference Bug in RFC 3261 ABNF

   It is possible to follow the IPv6reference production rule of RFC
   3261 ABNF -- the relevant portion of which is reproduced at the top
   of Section 4 -- and arrive at the following construct:

   [2001:db8:::192.0.2.1]

   Note the extra colon before the IPv4 address in the above construct.
   The correct construct, of course, is:

   [2001:db8::192.0.2.1]

   The ABNF pertaining to IPv6 references in RFC 3261 was derived from
   RFC 2373 [RFC2373], which has been obsoleted by RFC 4291 [RFC4291].
   The specific behavior of inserting an extra colon was inherited from
   RFC 2373, and has been remedied in RFC 4291.  However, following the
   Robustness Principle [RFC1122], an implementation must tolerate both
   of the above constructs.

   The message below includes an extra colon in the IPv6 reference.  A
   SIP implementation receiving such a message may exhibit robustness by
   successfully parsing the IPv6 reference (it can choose to ignore the
   extra colon when parsing the IPv6 reference.  If the SIP
   implementation is acting in the role of a proxy, it may additionally
   serialize the message without the extra colon to aid the next
   downstream server).

   The next message has the correct syntax for the IPv6 reference in the

5.  Security Considerations

   This document presents examples of SIP messages with IPv6 references
   contained in the signaling headers and SDP payload.  While this
   document may clarify the behavior of SIP elements processing a

   message with IPv6 references, it does not normatively change the base
   SIP [RFC3261] specification in any way.  Consequently, all security
   considerations in [RFC3261] apply.

   Parsers must carefully consider edge conditions and malicious input
   as part of their design.  Attacks on many Internet systems use
   crafted input to cause implementations to behave in undesirable ways.
   Many of the messages in this document are designed to stress a parser
   implementation at points traditionally used for such attacks.  This
   document does not, however, attempt to be comprehensive.  It contains
   some common pitfalls that the authors have discovered while parsing
   IPv6 identifiers in SIP implementations.

Appendix A.  Bit-Exact Archive of Each Test Message

   The following text block is an encoded, gzip compressed TAR archive
   of files that represent each of the example messages discussed in
   Section 4.

   To recover the compressed archive file intact, the text of this
   document may be passed as input to the following Perl script (the
   output should be redirected to a file or piped to &quot;tar -xzvf -&quot;).

   #!/usr/bin/perl
   use strict;
   my $bdata = &quot;&quot;;
   use MIME::Base64;
   while(&lt;&gt;) {
     if (/-- BEGIN MESSAGE ARCHIVE --/ .. /-- END MESSAGE ARCHIVE --/) {
          if ( m/^\s*[^\s]+\s*$/) {
              $bdata = $bdata . $_;
          }
     }
   }
   print decode_base64($bdata);

   Alternatively, the base-64 encoded block can be edited by hand to
   remove document structure lines and fed as input to any base-64
   decoding utility.
