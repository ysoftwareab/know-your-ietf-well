             IANA registry for PMSI Tunnel Type code points
                   draft-ietf-l3vpn-pmsi-registry-07

Abstract

   RFC 6514 created a space of Tunnel Type code points for a new BGP
   attribute called the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI
   Tunnel) attribute".  However the RFC did not create an IANA registry
   for these.

   There now is need to make further code point allocations from this
   name space.  This document serves to update RFC 6514 in that it
   creates an IANA registry for that purpose.

1.  Introduction

   In RFC 6514 'BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP
   IP VPNs' [RFC6514], an optional transitive BGP attribute called the
   "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute" is
   specified.  This BGP attribute uses an octet field to specify the
   PMSI tunnel type.  RFC 6514 allocates the values 0-7.

   There now is need to make further code point allocations from this
   name space.  In particular, draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast] needs to make such an allocation.
   However the RFC did not create an IANA registry for these codepoints.

   This document creates a new IANA registry called "P-Multicast Service
   Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel Types" for these code points.
   The registry is created in the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" registry.

   Creating this registry is an update of RFC 6514 [RFC6514].

2.  Security Considerations

   This document simply creates an IANA registry from a table in RFC
   6514.  Thus, there are no security concerns.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new registry called "P-Multicast
   Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel Types" in the "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.

Internet-Draft             PMSI IANA registry                August 2014


   The allocation policy for values 0x00 to 0xFA is IETF Review
   [RFC5226].  Values 0xFB to 0xFE are experimental and are not to be
   assigned. 0xFF is reserved, the status of 0xFF may only be changed
   through Standards Action [RFC5226].

   The initial registry should appear as:

      Value        Meaning                        Reference

      0x00         no tunnel information present  [RFC 6514]

      0x08 - 0xFA  Unassigned
      0xFB - 0xFE  Experimental                   [RFC-to-be]
