           Network Access Control List (ACL) YANG Data Model
                     draft-ietf-netmod-acl-model-20

Abstract

   This document defines a data model for Access Control List (ACL).  An
   ACL is a user-ordered set of rules, used to configure the forwarding
   behavior in device.  Each rule is used to find a match on a packet,
   and define actions that will be performed on the packet.

1.  Introduction

   Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements used to
   configure device forwarding behavior.  It is used in many networking
   technologies such as Policy Based Routing (PBR), firewalls etc.

   An ACL is an user-ordered set of rules, that is used to filter
   traffic on a networking device.  Each rule is represented by an
   Access Control Entry (ACE).

   Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of actions.

   The match criteria allow for definition of packet headers and
   metadata, the contents of which must match the definitions.

   o  Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such
      as address or Class of Service (CoS) or port numbers.

   o  In case a vendor supports it, metadata matches apply to fields
      associated with the packet but not in the packet header such as
      input interface or length of the packet as received over the wire.

   The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching
   criteria are met.  These actions are any operations that would apply
   to the packet, such as counting, policing, or simply forwarding.  The
   list of potential actions is unbounded depending on the capabilities
   of the networking devices.

   Access Control List is also widely knowns as ACL (pronounce as [ak-uh
   l]) or Access List.  In this document, Access Control List, ACL and
   Access List are used interchangeably.

   The matching of filters and actions in an ACE/ACL are triggered only
   after the application/attachment of the ACL to an interface, VRF,
   vty/tty session, QoS policy, or routing protocols, amongst various
   other configuration attachment points.  Once attached, it is used for
   filtering traffic using the match criteria in the ACEs and taking
   appropriate action(s) that have been configured against that ACE.  In
   order to apply an ACL to any attachment point other than an
   interface, vendors would have to augment the ACL YANG model.

2.  Problem Statement

   This document defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] data model for the
   configuration of ACLs.  It is very important that model can be used
   easily by application/attachment models.

   ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
   filter constructs and actions that they support.  Therefore this

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                 October 2018


   draft proposes a model that can be augmented by standard extensions
   and vendor proprietary models.

3.  Understanding ACL's Filters and Actions

   Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
   common understanding of what Access Control List (ACL) is.  A network
   system usually has a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered
   list of rules, also known as Access Control Entries (ACE).  Each ACE
   has a group of match criteria and a group of actions.  The match
   criteria allow for definition of contents of the packet headers or
   metadata, if supported by the vendor.  Packet header matching applies
   to fields visible in the packet such as address or CoS or port
   numbers.  Metadata matching applies to fields associated with the
   packet, but not in the packet header, such as input interface, packet
   length, or source or destination prefix length.  The actions can be
   any sort of operation from logging to rate limiting or dropping to
   simply forwarding.  Actions on the first matching ACE are applied
   with no processing of subsequent ACEs.

   The model also includes a container to hold overall operational state
   for each ACL and operational state for each ACE.  One ACL can be
   applied to multiple targets within the device, such as interface of a
   networking device, applications or features running in the device,
   etc.  When applied to interfaces of a networked device, distinct ACLs
   are defined for the ingress (input) or egress (output) interface.

   This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
   create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary
   models.  The base model is simple in design, and we hope to achieve
   enough flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model.

   The use of feature statements in the model allows vendors to
   advertise match rules they are capable and willing to support.  There
   are two sets of feature statements a device needs to advertise.  The
   first set of feature statements specify the capability of the device.
   These include features such as "Device can support matching on
   Ethernet headers" or "Device can support matching on IPv4 headers".
   The second set of feature statements specify the combinations of
   headers the device is willing to support.  These include features
   such as "Plain IPv6 ACL supported" or "Ethernet, IPv4 and IPv6 ACL
   combinations supported".

3.1.  ACL Modules

   There are two YANG modules in the model.  The first module, "ietf-
   access-control-list", defines generic ACL aspects which are common to
   all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor.  In effect, the module

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                 October 2018


   can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass".  It imports
   the second module, "ietf-packet-fields".  The match container in
   "ietf-access-control-list" uses groupings in "ietf-packet-fields" to
   specify match fields such as port numbers or protocol.  The
   combination of 'if-feature' checks and 'must' statements allow for
   the selection of relevant match fields that a user can define rules
   for.

   If there is a need to define a new "matches" choice, such as IPFIX
   [RFC7011], the container "matches" can be augmented.

4.  ACL YANG Models

4.1.  IETF Access Control List module

   "ietf-access-control-list" module defines the "acls" container that
   has a list of "acl".  Each "acl" has information identifying the
   access list by a name ("name") and a list ("aces") of rules



Jethanandani, et al.      Expires April 4, 2019                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                 October 2018


   associated with the "name".  Each of the entries in the list
   ("aces"), indexed by the string "name", has containers defining
   "matches" and "actions".

   The model defines several ACL types and actions in the form of
   identities and features.  Features are used by implementors to select
   the ACL types the system can support and identities are used to
   validate the types that have been selected.  These types are
   implicitly inherited by the "ace", thus safeguarding against
   misconfiguration of "ace" types in an "acl".

   The "matches" define criteria used to identify patterns in "ietf-
   packet-fields".  The choice statements within the match container
   allow for selection of one header within each of "l2", "l3", or "l4"
   headers.  The "actions" define behavior to undertake once a "match"
   has been identified.  In addition to permit and deny for actions, a
   logging option allows for a match to be logged that can later be used
   to determine which rule was matched upon.  The model also defines the
   ability for ACLs to be attached to a particular interface.

   Statistics in the ACL can be collected for an "ace" or for an
   "interface".  The feature statements defined for statistics can be
   used to determine whether statistics are being collected per "ace",
   or per "interface".

   This module imports definitions from Common YANG Data Types
   [RFC6991], and A YANG Data Model for Interface Management [RFC8343].

4.2.  IETF Packet Fields module

   The packet fields module defines the necessary groups for matching on
   fields in the packet including ethernet, ipv4, ipv6, and transport
   layer fields.  The "type" node determines which of these fields get
   included for any given ACL with the exception of TCP, UDP and ICMP
   header fields.  Those fields can be used in conjunction with any of
   the above layer 2 or layer 3 fields.

   Since the number of match criteria are very large, the base draft
   does not include these directly but references them by 'uses'
   statement to keep the base module simple.  In case more match
   conditions are needed, those can be added by augmenting choices
   within container "matches" in ietf-access-control-list.yang model.

   This module imports definitions from Common YANG Data Types [RFC6991]
   and references IP [RFC0791], ICMP [RFC0792], TCP [RFC0793],
   Definition of the Differentiated Services Field in the IPv4 and IPv6
   Headers [RFC2474], The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification
   (ECN) to IP [RFC3168], , IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture [RFC4007],

4.4.  Port Range Usage and Other Examples

   When a lower-port and an upper-port are both present, it represents a
   range between lower-port and upper-port with both the lower-port and
   upper-port included.  When only a port is present, it represents a
   port, with the operator specifying the range.

   The following XML example represents a configuration where TCP
   traffic from source ports 16384, 16385, 16386, and 16387 is dropped.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocol such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and
   the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM [RFC8341]) provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                 October 2018


   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

      /acls/acl/aces: This list specifies all the configured access
      control entries on the device.  Unauthorized write access to this
      list can allow intruders to modify the entries so as to permit
      traffic that should not be permitted, or deny traffic that should
      be permitted.  The former may result in a DoS attack, or
      compromise the device.  The latter may result in a DoS attack.
      The impact of an unauthorized read access of the list will allow
      the attacker to determine which rules are in effect, to better
      craft an attack.

      /acls/acl/aces/ace/actions/logging: This node specifies ability to
      log packets that match this ace entry.  Unauthorized write access
      to this node can allow intruders to enable logging on one or many
      ace entries, overwhelming the server in the process.  Unauthorized
      read access of this node can allow intruders to access logging
      information, which could be used to craft an attack the server.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers three URIs and three YANG modules.

6.1.  URI Registration

   This document registers three URIs in the IETF XML registry
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in RFC 3688, the following
   registration is requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-packet-fields
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ethertypes

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

6.2.  YANG Module Name Registration

   This document registers three YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry YANG [RFC6020].

7.  Acknowledgements

   Alex Clemm, Andy Bierman and Lisa Huang started it by sketching out
   an initial IETF draft in several past IETF meetings.  That draft
   included an ACL YANG model structure and a rich set of match filters,
   and acknowledged contributions by Louis Fourie, Dana Blair, Tula
   Kraiser, Patrick Gili, George Serpa, Martin Bjorklund, Kent Watsen,
   and Phil Shafer.  Many people have reviewed the various earlier
   drafts that made the draft went into IETF charter.

   Dean Bogdanovic, Kiran Agrahara Sreenivasa, Lisa Huang, and Dana
   Blair each evaluated the YANG model in previous drafts separately,
   and then worked together to created a ACL draft that was supported by
   different vendors.  That draft removed vendor specific features, and
   gave examples to allow vendors to extend in their own proprietary
   ACL.  The earlier draft was superseded with this updated draft and
   received more participation from many vendors.

   Authors would like to thank Jason Sterne, Lada Lhotka, Juergen
   Schoenwalder, David Bannister, Jeff Haas, Kristian Larsson and Einar
   Nilsen-Nygaard for their review of and suggestions to the draft.

Appendix A.  Extending ACL model examples

A.1.  A company proprietary module example

   Module "example-newco-acl" is an example of company proprietary model
   that augments "ietf-acl" module.  It shows how to use 'augment' with
   an XPath expression to add additional match criteria, actions, and
   default actions for when no ACE matches are found.  All these are
   company proprietary extensions or system feature extensions.
   "example-newco-acl" is just an example and it is expected that
   vendors will create their own proprietary models.

   module example-newco-acl {

     yang-version 1.1;

     namespace "http://example.com/ns/example-newco-acl";

A.2.  Linux nftables

   As Linux platform is becoming more popular as networking platform,
   the Linux data model is changing.  Previously ACLs in Linux were
   highly protocol specific and different utilities were used (iptables,
   ip6tables, arptables, ebtables), so each one had separate data model.
   Recently, this has changed and a single utility, nftables, has been
   developed.  With a single application, it has a single data model for
   filewall filters and it follows very similarly to the ietf-access-
   control list module proposed in this draft.  The nftables support
   input and output ACEs and each ACE can be defined with match and
   action.

   The example in Section 4.3 can be configured using nftable tool as
   below.

         nft add table ip filter
         nft add chain filter input
         nft add rule ip filter input ip protocol tcp ip saddr \
             192.0.2.1/24 drop

   The configuration entries added in nftable would be.

         table ip filter {
           chain input {
             ip protocol tcp ip saddr 192.0.2.1/24 drop
           }
         }


   We can see that there are many similarities between Linux nftables
   and IETF ACL YANG data models and its extension models.  It should be
   fairly easy to do translation between ACL YANG model described in
   this draft and Linux nftables.

A.3.  Ethertypes

   The ACL module is dependent on the definition of ethertypes.  IEEE
   owns the allocation of those ethertypes.  This model is being
   included here to enable definition of those types till such time that
   IEEE takes up the task of publication of the model that defines those
   ethertypes.  At that time, this model can be deprecated.
