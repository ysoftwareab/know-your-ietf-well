 Abstract 
    
   This document specifies the IPFIX protocol that provides network 
   operators with access to IP flow information. In order to export 
   IP flow information to the IPFIX collecting process, a common method 
   of representing the flow data and a standard means of communicating 
   them from an exporter to a collector required. This document 
   describes how the IPFIX flow record data, options record data and 
   control information (templates for example) are carried over a 
   congestion-aware transport protocol from IPFIX exporting process to 
   IPFIX collecting process.

   Issues in the Terminology section 
    
   PROTO-1: Is flowSet the right term to use? 
       - leave as is 
       - Record Set 
       - Record Array 
       - Record Collection 
       - Record List 
   PROTO-2: Some discrepancies between data types, field type and 
   Information 
       Element terminology. 
       - field type (IPFIX-PROTO) conflicts with field ID (IPFIX-INFO) 
       - suggestion: use field type instead of field Id in IPFIX-INFO 
       - rename 'type' to 'data type' and 'info elements' to 'fields' 
          in IPFIX-INFO 
   PROTO-3: IP encapsulated packet 
       - IP Traffic Flow definition speaks of IP packets 
       - Metering Process definitions say:  
         Input to the metering process are packets  
       - We don't want to limit ourselves to IPv4 and IPv6 
    
   Issues in the Transport Protocol section 
    
   PROTO-4: TCP and UDP are is not yet covered 
   PROTO-5: Error recovery, for example what to do if a collector 
       receives a message it can't decode. 
       Per protocol issue, ie TCP reset the session because it's a 
       stream protocol and can't recover. 
   PROTO-6: Section 5.2.3.3, Association: What happens if the Exporter 
   gets no response 
       from any Collector? 
       I think we should specify a (not-too-aggressive) retry 
       algorithm. 
   PROTO-7: Dropping data before export: What to do with sequence 
       numbers? 
   PROTO-8: Why having a stream per SID? 
   PROTO-9: IPFIX message should have MTU size. 
   PROTO-10: How to re-establish a lost connection? Procedure per 
   transport protocol? 
    
   Issues in the Failover section 
    
   PROTO-11: (initial version required) Section needs to be written

       If we tackle reliability/failover a state diagram is needed. 
    
   Issues in the Message Layout section 
    
   PROTO-12: Do we need the IETF exclusive template flowset format? 
       suggested solution: 
       - reserve flowset ID 0 & 1 for compatibility with NFv9 
       - try to make flowset ID 2 & 3 definition fully compatible with 
         NFv9 
       - add note that if you implement ID 2/3 correctly, you can also 
   process ID 0/1. 
   PROTO-13: How to distinguish IETF field IDs from vendor field IDs 
       - Specify method for detecting the difference in section 8. 
       - Add a note that there is a common ID space for for field types 
         used in data templates and option templates 
       - (Editorial) make clear that Section 8.2 also applies to option 
   templates 
   PROTO-14: Why do we need padding? Should we shift it to MAY? 
       limit the size of the padding? Yes 
       solution: 
       - padding shorter than actual Record Length 
       - fill with 0 
       - only at end of flowset 
       - applies to all flowsets 
       - padding is OPTIONAL (MAY) , not RECOMMENDED (SHOULD) 
    
   Issues in the IPFIX Message Format section 
    
   PROTO-15: Remove Reserved 2 octets in Vendor specific option 
   template flowset and add padding at the end 
   PROTO-16: relationship between several different scopes in one 
   record 
   PROTO-17: redefine scope values? 
       - 1 System 
         2 IP interface 
         3 observation domain (SID) (preciously called line card) 
         4 reserved (previously used for cache)

       - For example, the point 2 of the section "Template Management". 
         Remark: the template management will vary with TCP, SCTP, 
         etc... 
         Must have both sections updated: transport updated and

    Introduction 
 
    
   A data network with IP traffic, primarily consists of IP Flows 
   passing through the network elements of the network. It is often 
   interesting, useful or even a requirement to have access to 
   information about these flows that pass through the network elements 
   for administrative or other purposes. The IPFIX collecting process 
   should be able to receive the flow information passing through 
   multiple network elements within the data network. This requires an 
   uniformity in the method of representing the flow information and 
   the means of communicating the flows from the network elements to 
   the collection point. This document specifies the protocol to 
   achieve these afore mentioned requirements. This document specifies 
   in detail the representation of different flows, the additional data 
   required for flow interpretation, packet format, transport 
   mechanisms used, security concerns, etc. 
 
    
 2.1 
     IPFIX Documents Overview 
    
   The IPFIX protocol provides network administrators with access to IP 
   flow information. The architecture for the export of measured IP 
   flow information out of an IPFIX exporting process to a collecting 
   processing is defined in [IPFIX-ARCH], per the requirements defined 
   in [IPFIX-REQ]. [IPFIX-PROTO] specifies how IPFIX flow record data, 
   options record data and control information is carried via a

                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   congestion-aware transport protocol from IPFIX exporting process to 
   IPFIX collecting process. IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX 
   information elements (fields), their name, type and additional 
   semantic information, as specified in [IPFIX-INFO]. Finally [IPFIX-
   AS] describes what type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol 
   and how they can use the information provided. It furthermore shows 
   how the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and 
   frameworks. 
    
 3. 
    Terminology 
 
   The definition of the basic terms like IP Traffic Flow, Exporting 
   Process, Collecting Process, Observation Points etc. are 
   semantically identical with that found in the IPFIX requirements 
   document [IPFIX-REQ]. Some of the terms have been expanded for more 
   clarity when defining the protocol. Additional terms required for 
   the protocol has also been defined. For the same terms defined in 
   both this document and [IPFIX-ARCH], the definitions are identical 
   with [IPFIX-ARCH]. 
    
   The terminology summary table in Section 3.1 gives a quick overview 
   of the relationships between some of the different terms defined. 
 
 Observation Point 
    
   The Observation Point is a location in the network where IP packets 
   can be observed. Examples are a line to which a probe is attached, 
   a shared medium such as an Ethernet-based LAN, a single port of a 
   router, or a set of interfaces (physical or logical) of a router.   
    
   Note that one Observation Point may be a superset of several 
   other Observation Points. For example one Observation Point can be 
   an entire line card. This would be the superset of the 
   individual Observation Points at the line card's interfaces.  
 
 Observation Domain 
    
   The set of Observation Points, which is the largest aggregatable set 
   of Flow information at the Metering Process is termed an Observation 
   Domain. Each Observation Domain presents itself as a unique ID to 
   the Collecting Process for identifying the IPFIX Messages it 
   generates.   


 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                    [Page 8] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   For example, a router line card composed of several interfaces with 
   each interface being an Observation Point. Every Observation Point 
   is associated with an Observation Domain. 
    
 IP Traffic Flow or Flow 
    
   There are several definitions of the term 'flow' being used by the 
   Internet community.  Within the context of IPFIX we use the 
   following one: 
    
   A flow is defined as a set of IP packets passing an observation 
   point in the network during a certain time interval.  All packets 
   belonging to a particular flow have a set of common properties.  
   Each property is defined as the result of applying a function to the 
   values of: 
    
      1. one or more packet header field (e.g. destination IP address),    
      transport header field (e.g. destination port number), or  
      application header field (e.g. RTP header fields [RFC1889]) 
    
      2. one or more characteristics of the packet itself (e.g. number  
      of MPLS labels, etc...) 
    
      3. one or more of fields derived from packet treatment (e.g. next  
      hop IP address, the output interface, etc...) 
    
   A packet is defined to belong to a flow if it completely satisfies 
   all the defined properties of the flow. 
    
   This definition covers the range from a flow containing all packet 
   observed at a network interface to a flow consisting of just a 
   single packet between two applications with a specific sequence 
   number. 
 
Flow Key 
 
   Each of the fields which belong to 
    
     
     
      
      1. Packet header (e.g. destination IP address) 
     2. Property of the packet itself (e.g. packet length) 
     3. Derived from packet treatment (e.g. AS number) 
   which is used to define a Flow is termed as Flow Key. 
    
 Flow Type 
 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                    [Page 9] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
    
   A function F which would take input as a set of Flow Keys and 
   produce as output one or more Flows depending on the combination of 
   values for the set of Flow Keys. 
    
 Flow Record 
 
   A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow that was 
   observed at an Observation Point. A Flow Record contains measured 
   properties of the Flow (e.g. the total number of bytes of all 
   packets of the Flow) and usually characteristic properties of the 
   Flow (e.g. source IP address).  
 
 Metering Process 
    
   The Metering Process generates Flow Records. Input to the process 
   are packet headers observed at an Observation Point and packet 
   treatment at the Observation Point, for example the selected output 
   interface. 
   The Metering Process consists of a set of functions that includes 
   packet header capturing, timestamping, sampling, classifying, and 
   maintaining Flow Records. 
    
   The maintenance of Flow Records may include creating new records, 
   updating existing ones, computing Flow statistics, deriving further 
   Flow properties, detecting Flow expiration, passing Flow Records to 
   the Exporting Process, and deleting Flow Records. 
 
 Exporting Process 
    
   The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more Collecting 
   Processes. The Flow Records are generated by one or more Metering 
   Processes. 
    
 IPFIX Device 
    
   A device hosting at least an Observation Point, a Metering Process 
   and an Exporting Process. Typically, corresponding Observation 
   Point(s), Metering Process(es) and Exporting Process(es) are co-
   located at this device, for example at a router.

 IPFIX Node

   An IPFIX node is a host that implements the IPFIX protocol 
   which means it contains an Exporting Process or a Collecting 
   Process or both.
    
 Collecting Process 
    
 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 10] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   The Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more 
   Exporting Processes. The Collecting Process might store received 
   Flow Records or further process them, but these actions are out of 
   the scope of this document. 
    
 Collector 
 
   The device which hosts one or more Collecting Processes. 
    
 Flow Recording Process 
 
   The Flows generated from the metering device(s) in an Observation 
   Domain could  be collected into one or more database before 
   exporting. This functional block in addition to maintaining the Flow 
   database(s) does Flow aggregation, maintain the aggregate statistics 
   etc.  
    
   This block is optional for an IPFIX device. 
 
 Template 
        
   Template is an ordered n-tuple (e.g. <type,length>, TLV), used to 
   completely identify the structure and semantics of a particular 
   information that needs to be communicated from the IPFIX Device to 
   the Collector. Each template is uniquely identifiable by some means 
   (e.g. by using a Template ID). 
 
 Control Information, Data Stream 
 
   The information that needs to be exported from the IPFIX device can 
   be classified into the following categories: 
    
   - Control Information: 
   This includes the Flow type definition, selection criteria for 
   packets within the Flow sent by the Exporting Process and any IPFIX 
   protocol messages (e.g. keepalives). The 'control' stream carries 
   all the information needed for the end-points to understand the 
   IPFIX protocol, and specifically for the receiver to understand and 
   interpret the data sent by the sender. 
    
   - Data Stream:

                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   This includes data records carrying the field values for the various 
   observed Flows at each of the Observation Point. A sequence of such 
   records may also be described as a Data Stream. 
    
 IPFIX Message 
 
   An IPFIX Message is a message originating at the Exporting Process 
   that carries the IPFIX records of this Exporting Process and whose 
   destination is the Collecting Process. An IPFIX Message is 
   encapsulated within a transport layer header. 
    
 Message Header 
 
   The Message Header is the first part of an IPFIX Message, which 
   provides basic information about the message such as the IPFIX 
   version, length of the message, message sequence number, etc. 
    
 Template Record 
 
   A Template Record defines the structure and interpretation of fields 
   in a Flow Data Record. 
    
 Flow Data Record 
    
   A Flow Data Record is a data record that contains values of the Flow 
   parameters corresponding to a Template Record.  
    
 Options Template Record 
    
   An Options Template Record defines the structure and interpretation 
   of fields in an Options Data Record, including defining how to scope 
   the applicability of the Options Data Record. 
    
 Options Data Record 
    
   The Options Data Record is a data record that contains values and 
   scope information of the Flow measurement parameters, corresponding 
   to an Options Template Record. 
 
 FlowSet

   FlowSet is a generic term for a collection of records that have a 
   similar structure. In an IPFIX Message, one or more FlowSets follow 
   the Message Header. 
   There are three different types of FlowSets: Template FlowSet, 
   Options Template FlowSet, and Data FlowSet.   
    
 Template FlowSet 
 
   A Template FlowSet is a collection of one or more Template Records 
   that have been grouped together in an IPFIX Message.   
 
 Options Template FlowSet 
 
   An Options Template FlowSet is a collection of one or more Options 
   Template Records that have been grouped together in an IPFIX 
   Message. 
    
 Data FlowSet 
 
   A Data FlowSet is one or more records, of the same type, that are 
   grouped together in an IPFIX Message. Each record is either a Flow 
   Data Record or an Options Data Record previously defined by a 
   Template Record or an Options Template Record. 
    
 Information Element 
    
   An Information Element is a protocol and encoding independent 
   description of an attribute which may appear in an IPFIX Flow 
   Record. The IPFIX information model [IPFIX-INFO] defines the base 
   set of Information Elements for IPFIX. The type associated with an 
   Information Element indicates constraints on what it may contain and 
   also determine the valid encoding mechanisms for use in IPFIX.

 4. 
    Criteria for Flow Expiration and Export 
    
 4.1 
     Flow Expiration 
     
   A Flow is considered as expired under the following conditions:  
    
   1. If the Metering Process can detect the end of a Flow. For 
   example, if the FIN or RST bit is detected in a TCP 
   [TCP] connection.  
    
   2. If no packets belonging to the Flow have been observed for a 
   certain period of time. This time period SHOULD be configurable at 
   the Metering Process. Note that if the time period is set to 0, the 
   Metering Process will create a Flow for every single packet 
   observed. 
    
   3. If the Metering Process experiences internal constraints, a Flow 
   MAY be expired forcibly. For example, counters wrapping or low 
   memory. 
     
 4.2 
     Flow Export 
    
   A flow can be exported because it expired due to the reasons 
   mentioned in Flow Expiration section. The exporting process decides 
   when and whether to export an expired flow. For example: the 

 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 14] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   exporting process exports a portion of the expired flows every 'x' 
   seconds.  
    
   For long-lasting Flows, the Exporting Process SHOULD export the Flow 
   Records on a regular basis or based on some export policy. This 
   periodicity or export policy SHOULD be configurable at the Metering 
   Process. 
 
 5. 
    Transport Protocol 
    
   The IPFIX Protocol Specifications have been designed to be transport 
   protocol independent. Note that the Exporter can export to multiple 
   Collecting Processes, using independent transport protocols. 
    
    
 5.1 
     Transport Compliance and Transport Usage 
 
   We must differentiate between what must be implemented (so that 
   operators can interoperably deploy compliant implementations from 
   different vendors) and what should or could be used in various 
   operational environments. We must also make sure that ALL 
   implementations can operate in a congestion-aware and congestion 
   avoiding mode. 
      
   SCTP [RFC2960] MUST be implemented by all compliant implementations. 
   UDP [UDP] and TCP [TCP] MAY also be implemented by compliant 
   implementations. 
    
   SCTP SHOULD be used in deployments where exporters and collectors 
   are communicating over links which are susceptible to congestion. 
    
   TCP MAY be used in deployments where exporters and collectors 
   communicate over links which are susceptible to congestion, but SCTP 
   is preferred, due to its ability to limit back pressure on exporters 
   (especially when using PR-SCTP [SCTP-PR]) and its message vs. stream 
   orientation. 
    
   Other non-congestion aware protocols (like UDP) MAY be used in 
   deployments where exporters and collectors always communicate over 
   dedicated links which are not susceptible to congestion.

   TCP [TCP]  
    
 5.3 
     SCTP 
    
   This section describes how IPFIX can be transported over SCTP 
   [RFC2960] using traditional reliable mode.  
    
   IPFIX can also be transported over the partial reliable or 
   unreliable mode [PR-SCTP]. These last 2 modes will be briefly 
   discussed, while waiting for [PR-SCTP] to become a standard. 

 5.3.1    Congestion Avoidance 
    
   The SCTP transport protocol provides the required level of 
   congestion avoidance by design. 

 5.3.2    Reliability 
    
   The SCTP transport protocol is by default reliable, but has the 
   capability to operate in unreliable and partially reliable modes 
   [PR-SCTP]. 
    
   Using reliable SCTP streams (referred to hereafter as "streams") for 
   the IPFIX export is not in itself a guarantee that all records are 
   delivered. If there is congestion on the link from the exporter to 
   the collector, or if a significant amount of retransmissions are 
   needed, the send queues on the Exporting Process may fill up. In 
   that case it's up to the Exporting Process to decide what to do. It 
   MAY either halt export (buffer the data until there is space in the 
   send queues again) or discard IPFIX Messages away instead of 
   inserting them into the send queue. If any data is not inserted into 
   the send queues, the sequence numbers used for export must reflect 
   the loss of data. 

 5.3.3    Exporting Process 

 5.3.3.1  MTU size 
    
   Each IPFIX Message SHOULD be equal to or less than the local MTU in 
   size. When an IPFIX Message is transmitted over a network with an 
   MTU smaller than the local MTU, IP fragmentation may be used.

                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
 5.3.3.2 Source ID 
    
   The IPFIX Message MUST contain a Message Header, which includes a 
   source id (SID). The SID indicates from which Observation Domain the 
   data is being exported, and should be kept unique for each such 
   Observation Domain. 
    
   If a Metering Process consists of a single Observation Domain, a 
   single SID value MUST be used for all IPFIX Messages. The Exporting 
   Process will typically open one association to the collector, but 
   more are possible, in which one or more streams can be used. The 
   Exporting Process has the choice of transmitting parts of the export 
   data in separate streams or all data in one stream. 
    
   If a Metering Process consists of multiple Observation Domains, one 
   SID value for each Observation Domain MUST be used. The Exporting 
   Process will typically open one association, but more are possible, 
   in which at least one stream per Observation Domain is used. 
    
   The Exporting Process has the choice of using more than one stream 
   per Observation Domain, but data from multiple Observation Domains 
   should not be transmitted over the same stream. 

 5.3.3.3  Association 
    
   The Exporting Process MAY create one or more associations 
   (connection "bundle" in SCTP terminology) to the Collecting Process. 
   The Collecting Process MAY not initiate the connection. Inside each 
   association one or more streams MAY be requested by the Exporting 
   Process. If the Collecting Process can not support the requested 
   number of streams, it MAY choose to refuse the connection and the 
   Exporting Process should try to reduce, if possible, the number of 
   streams needed to perform the export. 

 5.3.3.4  Stream 
    
   An Observation Domain MUST use at least one stream, but MAY use 
   multiple streams, to export data records. The Observation Domain 
   MUST use the same SID value for all streams used. 
    
   An Exporting Process must not transmit messages with different SID 


 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 17] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   values in one stream, the Collecting Process should however verify 
   that the SID values are the expected values. 

 5.3.3.5  Template 
    
   Since the SCTP association is connection oriented the available 
   Template Records MUST be transmitted from each Observation Domain to 
   the Collecting Process immediately after the association is 
   established. 
    
   As a minimum the Template Records MUST be transmitted immediately 
   after they start to exist on the Metering Process and SHOULD 
   preferably be transmitted before any data, using the new Template 
   Record, have been transmitted. The Collecting Process SHOULD however 
   accept data without a Template Record. 
     
   When using a reliable mode for Template Record export, or if the 
   exporter knows that the IPFIX Message containing the templates was 
   positively acknowledged by the SCTP layer, it is not necessary to 
   periodically export the Template Records. 

 5.3.4    Collecting Process  
    
   The Collecting Process SHOULD listen for a new association request 
   from the Exporting Process. The Exporting Process will request a 
   number of streams to use for export. If the Collecting Process 
   doesn't support the number of streams inside the association, the 
   Collecting Process MUST refuse the connection and continue listen 
   for a new request.  
    
   When data is received from an association, the Collecting Process 
   MUST correlate data, with the same SID (Source ID) value, from 
   multiple streams into one export Flow from an Observation Domain. 
   This allows the Observation Domain to use separate streams for 
   different types of information. 
    
   The Collecting Process SHOULD verify that the received IPFIX 
   Messages inside one stream does not have differing SID values. The 
   Exporting Process MUST not transmit messages inside one stream with 
   multiple SID values. The correlated Flow Records are then treated 
   like a normal export Flow.

 5.3.5    SCTP Partially Reliable  
 
   This mode will not be discussed any further until [PR-SCTP] becomes 
   a standard, even if this mode offers a few advantages: 
   freedom to use SCTP as a reliable, single stream transport, as well 
   as multiple streams with different properties, for example in terms 
   of reliability, carrying different data types dependant on their 
   importance for the system. 
   Unreliable or partial reliability may be chosen for one or more 
   streams inside an association. Unreliable transport MAY be preferred 
   where large amount of data is to be exported and keeping send queues 
   is either an unnecessary overhead or impractical. Partial 
   reliability MAY be chosen where a small amount of queuing is 
   possible. 
    
   Naturally it is better to send templates over a reliable stream and 
   send the data on an unreliable (or partial reliable) stream. When an 
   exporter handles data with different properties it might even be 
   preferable to send them over different streams according to those 
   properties. 
    
   Example: an Exporting Process can use two streams per Observation 
   Domain. A reliable stream could be used for exporting templates, to 
   reduce the likelihood of loss and to remove the need for blind 
   retransmissions, and a partial or unreliable stream for data, to 
   avoid buffering of large amounts of data.

 7. 
    Message Layout 
    
   An IPFIX Message consists of a Message Header followed by one or 
   more FlowSets. The FlowSets can be any of the possible three types: 
   Template, Data, or Options Template.  
    
   IPFIX Message: 
   +--------+-------------------------------------------+ 
   |        | +----------+ +---------+ +----------+     | 
   |Message | | Template | | Data    | | Options  |     | 
   | Header | | FlowSet  | | FlowSet | | Template | ... | 
   |        | |          | |         | | FlowSet  |     | 
   |        | +----------+ +---------+ +----------+     | 
   +--------+-------------------------------------------+ 
 
   A FlowSet ID is used to distinguish the different types of FlowSets. 
   FlowSet IDs lower than 256 are reserved for special FlowSets, such 
   as the Template FlowSet (ID 0) and the Options Template FlowSet (ID 
   1). The Data FlowSets have a FlowSet ID greater than 255. 
 
   The format of the Template, Data, and Options Template FlowSets will 
   be discussed later in this document. The Exporter MUST code all 
   binary integers of the Message Header and the different FlowSets in 
   network byte order (also known as the big-endian byte ordering). 
    
   Following are some examples of IPFIX Messages: 
    
   1. An IPFIX Message consisting of interleaved Template, Data, and 
   Options Template FlowSets-A newly created Template is exported as 
   soon as possible. So if there is already an IPFIX Message with a 
   Data FlowSet that is being prepared for export, the Template and 
   Option FlowSets are also interleaved with this information, subject 
   to availability of space. 
    
   IPFIX Message:

                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   +--------+--------------------------------------------------------+ 
   |        | +----------+ +---------+     +-----------+ +---------+ | 
   |Message | | Template | | Data    |     | Options   | | Data    | | 
   | Header | | FlowSet  | | FlowSet | ... | Template  | | FlowSet | | 
   |        | |          | |         |     | FlowSet   | |         | | 
   |        | +----------+ +---------+     +-----------+ +---------+ | 
   +--------+--------------------------------------------------------+  
    
   2. An IPFIX Message consisting entirely of Data FlowSets-After the 
   appropriate Template Records have been defined and transmitted to 
   the Collecting Process, the majority of IPFIX Messages consists 
   solely of Data FlowSets.  
    
   IPFIX Message: 
   +--------+----------------------------------------------+ 
   |        | +---------+     +---------+      +---------+ | 
   |Message | | Data    | ... | Data    | ...  | Data    | | 
   | Header | | FlowSet | ... | FlowSet | ...  | FlowSet | | 
   |        | +---------+     +---------+      +---------+ | 
   +--------+----------------------------------------------+   
 
   3. An IPFIX Message consisting entirely of Template and Options 
   Template FlowSets-The Exporter MAY transmit a message containing 
   Template and Options Template FlowSets periodically to help ensure 
   that the Collecting Process has the correct Template Records and 
   Options Template Records when the corresponding Flow Data records 
   are received.  
    
   IPFIX Message: 
   +--------+-------------------------------------------------+ 
   |        | +----------+     +----------+      +----------+ | 
   |Message | | Template |     | Template |      | Options  | | 
   | Header | | FlowSet  | ... | FlowSet  | ...  | Template | | 
   |        | |          |     |          |      | FlowSet  | | 
   |        | +----------+     +----------+      +----------+ |

           the current Observation Domain by the Exporting Process. 
           This value MUST SHOULD be used by the Collecting Process to 
           identify whether any IPFIX Messages have been missed. 
 
   Source ID 
           A 32-bit value that identifies the Exporter Process 
           Observation Domain. Collecting Process SHOULD use the 
           combination of the source IP address and the Source ID field 
           to separate different export streams originating from the 
           same Exporting Process. 
            
            
 8.2 
     Field Type Format 
            
   This section describes the Field Type format for both IETF specified 
   Information Elements [IPFIX-INFO] and Vendor Specified Information 
   Elements. Vendors need the ability to define proprietary Information

   Elements, because, for example, they are delivering pre-standards 
   product, or the Information Element is in some way commercially 
   sensitive.  
    
   The Field Ids used to identify Information Elements are divided into 
   two non-overlapping ranges: the IETF specified range and the vendor  
   specified range. This partitioning of the identifiers into two  
   ranges allows the Collecting Process to discriminate between an IETF  
   specified Information Element and a Vendor Specified Information 
   Element. The vendor specified range is shared by all vendors, and 
   thus needs an accompanying vendor identifier to uniquely identify 
   it.

 8.3 
     Template FlowSet Format 
    
   One of the essential elements in the IPFIX format is the Template 
   FlowSet. Templates greatly enhance the flexibility of the Flow 
   Record format because they allow the Collecting Process to process 
   Flow Records without necessarily knowing the interpretation of all 
   the data in the Flow Record.  

 8.3.1    IETF Exclusive Template FlowSet Format 
    
   The IETF exclusive Template FlowSet MAY be used when the template  
   contains only IETF defined Information Elements. This format is 
   provided for backwards compatibility [NETFLOW9]. The format of the 
   IETF exclusive Template FlowSet is shown in Figure C.

     FlowSet ID 
           FlowSet ID value of 0 is reserved for the Template FlowSet. 
    
     Length 
           Total length of this FlowSet. Because an individual Template 
           FlowSet MAY contain multiple Template Records, the Length 
           value MUST be used to determine the position of the next 
           FlowSet record, which could be any type of FlowSet. Length 
           is the sum of the lengths of the FlowSet ID, the Length 
           itself, and all Template Records within this FlowSet. 
            
     Template ID 
           Each of the newly generated Template Records is given a 
           unique Template ID. This uniqueness is local to the 
           Observation Domain that generated the Template ID.      
           Template IDs 0-255 are reserved for Template FlowSets, 
           Options FlowSets, and other reserved FlowSets yet to be 
           created. Template IDs of Data FlowSets are numbered from 256 
           to 65535.

     Field Count 
           Number of fields in this Template Record. Because a Template 
           FlowSet usually contains multiple Template Records, this 
           field allows the Collecting Process to determine the end of 
           the current Template Record and the start of the next. 
  
     Field Type 
           A numeric value that represents the type of the field. Refer 
           to [IPFIX-INFO].        
 
     Field Length 
           The length of the corresponding Field Type, in bytes. Refer 
           to [IPFIX-INFO].    

 8.3.2    Vendor Specified Template FlowSet Format 
    
   A vendor specified Template FlowSet MUST be used when the template 
   contains one or more Vendor Specified Information Elements. A vendor 
   specified template MAY exclusively contain IETF defined Field Types. 
   A vendor specified template MAY contain Vendor Specified Information 
   Elements from multiple vendors.

   Data FlowSet Field Descriptions  
    
   FlowSet ID = Template ID 
           Each Data FlowSet is associated with a FlowSet ID. The 
           FlowSet ID maps to a (previously generated) Template ID. The 
           Collecting Process MUST use the FlowSet ID to find the 
           corresponding Template Record and decode the Flow Records 
           from the FlowSet. 
    
   Length 
           The length of this FlowSet.  
           Length is the sum total of lengths of FlowSet ID, Length 
           itself, all Flow Records within this FlowSet, and the 
           padding bytes, if any.       
    
   Record N - Field Value M 
           The remainder of the Data FlowSet is a collection of Flow 
           Data Record(s), each containing a set of field types and 
           values. The Type and Length of the fields have been 
           previously defined in the Template Record referenced by the 
           FlowSet ID or Template ID. 
    
   Padding 
           The Exporting Process SHOULD insert some padding bytes so 
           that the subsequent FlowSet starts at a 4-byte aligned 
           boundary. It is important to note that the Length field 
           includes the padding bits.

                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   Interpretation of the Data FlowSet format can be done only if the 
   Template FlowSet corresponding to the Template ID is available at 
   the Collecting Process.   
    
 8.5 
     Options Template FlowSet Format 
    
   The Options Template Record (and its corresponding Options Data 
   Record) is used to supply information about the Metering Process 
   configuration or Metering Process specific data, rather than 
   supplying information about IP Flows. 
   For example, the Options Template FlowSet can report the sample rate 
   of a specific interface, if sampling is supported, along with the 
   sampling method used.  

 8.5.1    IETF Exclusive Options Template FlowSet Format 
    
   The IETF exclusive Options Template FlowSet Format MAY be used  
   when the template contains only IETF defined options. This format  
   is provided for backwards compatibility [NETFLOW9]. The format of  
   the IETF exclusive Options Template FlowSet Format is shown in  
   Figure E.

   The IETF Exclusive Options Template FlowSet Field Definitions are  
   as follows: 
    
   FlowSet ID = 1 
           A FlowSet ID value of 1 is reserved for the Options 
           Template. 
    
   Length 
           Total length of this FlowSet. Each Options Template FlowSet 
           MAY contain multiple Options Template Records. Thus, the 
           Length value MUST be used to determine the position of the 
           next FlowSet record, which could be either a Template 
           FlowSet or Data FlowSet.                
           Length is the sum total of lengths of FlowSet ID, the Length 
           itself, and all Options Template Records within this FlowSet 
           Template ID. 
    
   Template ID 
           Template ID of this Options Template. This value is greater 
           than 255. 
     
   Option Scope Length 
           The length in bytes of any Scope fields definition contained 
           in the Options Template Record (The use of "Scope" is 
           described below).  
    
   Option Length 
           The length (in bytes) of any options field definitions 
           contained in this Options Template Record. 
    
   Scope 1 Field Type 
           The relevant portion of the Exporting Process/Metering 
           Process to which the Options Data Record refers. 
           Currently defined values are:  
               1 System   
               2 Interface  
               3 Line Card  
               4 Cache  
               5 Template         
           For example, the Metering Process can be implemented on a 
           per-interface basis, so if the Options Template Record were 
           reporting on how the Metering Process is configured, the 
           Scope for the report would be 2 (interface). The associated

                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
           interface ID would then be carried in the associated Options 
           Data FlowSet. The Scope can be limited further by listing 
           multiple scopes that all must match at the same time. Note 
           that the Scope fields always precede the Option fields. 
    
   Scope 1 Field Length 
           The length (in bytes) of the Scope field, as it would appear 
           in an Options Data Record. 
    
   Option 1 Field Type 
           A numeric value that represents the type of field that would 
           appear in the Options Template Record. Refer to [IPFIX-
           INFO]. 
    
   Option 1 Field Length 
           The length (in bytes) of the Option Field. 
    
   Padding 
           The Exporting Process SHOULD insert some padding bytes so 
           that the subsequent FlowSet starts at a 4-byte aligned 
           boundary. It is important to note that the Length field 
           includes the padding bits. 

 8.5.2    Vendor Specified Options Template FlowSet Format 
    
   A vendor specified Options Template MUST be used when the template 
   contains one or more vendor specified options. A vendor specified 
   Options Template MAY exclusively contain IETF defined Field Types. A 
   vendor specified template MAY contain Vendor Specified Information 
   Elements from multiple vendors.  
    
   The format of the Vendor Specified Options Template FlowSet is shown 
   in Figure E.

 8.5.3   Options Data Record Format 
    
   The Options Data Records are sent in Data FlowSets, on a regular 
   basis, but not with every Flow Data Record. How frequently these 
   Options Data Records are exported is configurable. See the Templates 
   Management" section for more details.

   Options Data Records of the Data FlowSet Field Descriptions  
    
   FlowSet ID = Template ID 
           A FlowSet ID precedes each group of Options Data Records 
           within a Data FlowSet. The FlowSet ID maps to a previously 
           generated Template ID corresponding to this Options Template 
           Record. The Collecting Process MUST use the FlowSet ID to 
           map the appropriate type and length to any field values that 
           follow. 
    
   Length 
           The length of this FlowSet.

                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
           Length is the sum of the lengths of the FlowSet ID, Length 
           itself, all the Options Data Records within this FlowSet, 
           and the padding bytes, if any. 
 
   Record N - Option Field M Value 
           The remainder of the Data FlowSet is a collection of Flow 
           Records, each containing a set of scope and field values. 
           The type and length of the fields were previously defined in 
           the Options Template Record referenced by the FlowSet ID or 
           Template ID. 
    
   Padding 
           The Exporting Process SHOULD insert some padding bytes so 
           that the subsequent FlowSet starts at a 4-byte aligned 
           boundary. It is important to note that the Length field 
           includes the padding bits. 
    
   The Data FlowSet format can be interpreted only if the Options 
   Template FlowSet corresponding to the Template ID is available at 
   the Collecting Process. 
 
 9. 
    Specific Reporting Requirements 
    
 Some specific Options Templates and Options Templates Records are 
 necessary to provide extra information about the Flow Records and 
 about the Metering Process.  
  
 The ipfixOption [IPFIX-INFO], always included in these specific 
 Options Templates, defines the type of information sent in the Option 
 Template / Option Template Record pair. For example, if the 
 ipfixOption [IPFIX-INFO] value is METER_STATS, then the Option 
 Template will specify information about the Metering Process 
 statistics. The ipfixOption [IPFIX-INFO] MUST always be the first Data 
 Type in the Option Template so that the Collector could quickly 
 determine whether or not a specific Option Template is described. And 
 if the ipfixOption [IPFIX-INFO] is present, which specific Option 
 Template type it defines.  
  
 The minimum set of Data Types is always specified in these Specific 
 IPFIX Options Templates. Nevertheless, extra Data Types MAY be used in 
 these specific Options Templates.

 9.1 
     The Metering Process Statistics Option Template 
 
 The Metering Process Statistics Option Template defines the Metering 
 Process Statistics with the export of the following Data Types [IPFIX-
 INFO]: 
     ipfixOption             The value MUST be METER_STATS 
     observationDomain       Source ID 
     lostFlows               flows not exported due to resource   
                             starvation 
     lostFlowsPacket         Packets in the lost flows 
     lostFlowsBytes          Bytes in the lost flows  
     droppedPacketCount      Packets dropped by Metering Process  
                            at the Observation Point 
     droppedByteCount        Bytes dropped by Metering Process at the  
                             Observation Domain 
     time;                   When this record was generated 
 
The minimum set of Data Type in the Metering Process Statistics Option 
Template is: ipfixOption, observationDomain, lostFlows, time 
 
 10. 
     Export Packet "Export Time" Computation and Flow Record Time 
    
 10.1 
      Microsecond Precision 
    
   For a Data FlowSet with Flow Records requiring microsecond 
   precision, the Export Packet "Export Time" field MUST be calculated 
   so that each Flow Records flowStartUsec [IPFIX-INFO] and flowEndUsec 
   [IPFIX-INFO] would contain a 32 bit signed microsecond offset from 
   the "Export Time" base timestamp. Hereafter some pseudo code to 
   calculate the Export Time in one pass, which would return an 
   absolute duration of 35 minutes for all Flow Records contained in 
   the Data FlowSet. Flow Records MUST be exported in different Export 
   Packet if the absolute duration can not fit in those 35 minutes. 
    
   //  pseudo code for microsecond offset in IPFIX encoded Flow Records. 
   // 
    
      struct flow{ 
         uint32  tv_sec; 
         uint32  tv_usec; 
         uint32  numbytes; 
         ...  // other information elements... 
      }; 
    
      struct flow flowtable [MAX_TABLE_SIZE]; 
 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 35] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
      int lastflowindex = -1; 
    
      writeflows() { 
    
         if (lastflowindex < 0) return; 
    
         // simply take the second field from the first available flow 
         // and make this the base time for this collection of flows. 
         uint32  base_sec = flowtable[0].tv_sec; 
    
         writeheaderToSocket(base_sec); // put 32-bit second value in header 
    
         for (int i=0; i<=lastflowindex; i++){ 
    
            int32 offset = (flowtable[i].tv_sec - base_sec) * 1000000 + 
   flowtable[i].tv_usec; 
            writeint32ToSocket(offset);  // put the 32-bit time offset in the 
   record. 
    
            // write other information elements... 
         } 
      } 
    
   A two pass approach calculation for the optimum (center) "Export 
   Time" base timestamp would allow an absolute duration of 71 minutes 
   for all Flow Records contained in the Data FlowSet. The two pass 
   approach MAY be used.  
   The "Export Time" base timestamp calculation requires that at the 
   Export Packet exporting time the Exporting Process MUST run down the 
   list of Flow Records in the Data FlowSet message and adjust the Flow 
   start and Flow end timestamps. 
    
 10.2 
      Millisecond Precision 
    
   For a Data FlowSet with Flow Records requiring a millisecond 
   precision, the same principles as in section 10.1 "Microsecond 
   Precision" will be used.  
    
   The only difference will be that the Flow start and the Flow end 
   SHOULD now be represented respectively by the flowStartMsec [IPFIX-
   INFO] and flowEndMsec [IPFIX-INFO]. As a consequence of the 
   millisecond precision, the absolute duration of all Flow Records is 
   now of about 49 days. The Export Header "Export Time" base time 
   SHOULD be calculated with the algorithm described in the Section 
   10.1 "Microsecond Precision". In order to reduce the load on the 
   Exporter, the Export Header "Export Time" MAY be the time in seconds 
   since 0000 UTC 1970 at which the Export Packet leaves the Exporter 
 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 36] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   and not the calculated optimum value anymore as described in section 
   10.1 "Microsecond Precision". 
    
   Alternatively, for a Data FlowSet with Flow Records requiring a 
   millisecond precision, the microsecond mechanism as described in 
   section 10.1 MAY be used as such. The Flow Record MAY use the 
   flowStartUsec [IPFIX-INFO] and flowEndUsec [IPFIX-INFO] rounded at a 
   millisecond precision.  
    
 10.3 
      Nanosecond Precision 
    
   For a Data FlowSet with Flow Records requiring a nanosecond 
   precision, all Flow Records will contain Flow start flowStartNsec 
   [IPFIX-INFO] and flowEndNsec [IPFIX-INFO]. The Export Header "Export 
   Time" will be of no use on the Collector side in this case as 
   the flowStartNsec [IPFIX-INFO] and flowEndNsec [IPFIX-INFO] both 
   have a nanosecond precision already. Both flowStartNsec [IPFIX-INFO] 
   and flowEndNsec [IPFIX-INFO] use the NTP time format which is 
   represented as a 64-bit value which contains a 32-bit specification 
   of seconds since 1900 and a 32-bit "fraction" field.  Refer to the 
   NTP specification, RFC1305, section 3.1 "Data Formats". 
    
 10.4 
      Multiple Precisions 
     
   When Flow Records requiring different precisions must be exported, 
   the Exporting Process SHOULD split the Flow Records in different 
   Data FlowSet according to the precision:  millisecond, microsecond 
   or nanosecond. 
    
 11. 
     Linkage with the Information Model 
 
   The information model associates each IPFIX Data Type with a well 
   defined type, such as hexBinary, long, unsignedInt, etc. 
    
   This document defines how fields of a given type are encoded. 
    
 11.1 
      Boolean 
 
   A boolean field shall be encoded in a single byte with the value of 
   0 indicating false and any other value indicating true. 
    
 11.2 
      Byte 
 

 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 37] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   A byte value shall be encoded as a single byte representing a value 
   between -128 and 127. The value is represented in two's complement 
   notation.  
    
 11.3 
      UnsignedByte 
 
   An unsigned byte value shall be encoded as a single byte 
   representing a value between 0 and 255. 
    
 11.4 
      Short 
 
   A short is a 16-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-
   32768,32767].  The short is represented in two's complement 
   notation.  The most and least significant bytes are 0 and 1, 
   respectively 
    
    
   EDITOR NOTE: this section 11 must be completed with types used in 
   [IPFIX-INFO]. 
    
 11.5 
      Reduced Size Encoding of Integral Types 
 
   Information Elements containing integral types in the information 
   model MAY be encoded using fewer bytes than those implied by their 
   type in the information model definition [IPFIX-INFO], based on the 
   assumption that the smaller type is sufficient to carry any value 
   the Exporter may need to deliver. This reduces the network bandwidth 
   requirement between the Exporter and the Collector. Note that the 
   information model Data Types definition [IPFIX-INFO] will always 
   define the maximum encoding size for each Data Type. 
    
   For instance the information model [IPFIX-INFO] defines byteCount as 
   an unsignedLong type, which would require 64-bits.  However if the 
   exporter will never locally encounter the need to send a value 
   larger than 4294967295, it may chose to send the value instead as an 
   unsignedInt. For example, a core router would require an 
   unsignedLong byteCount while an unsignedInt might be sufficient for 
   an access router. 
    
   This behavior is indicated by the Exporter by specifying a type size 
   smaller than that associated with the assigned type of the field. In 
   the example above the Exporter would place a length of 4 vs. 8 in 
   the template.

   Reduced sizing MAY only be applied to the following integral types:  
   short, unsignedShort, int, unsignedInt, long, unsignedLong. In each 
   case the downcasting must be to a smaller integral type which MUST 
   have the same signed vs. unsigned properties. 
    
   Specifically unsignedLong may be downcast to unsignedInt, 
   unsignedShort or unsignedByte.  A long may be downcast to an int a 
   short or a byte.  The other downcasts follow the same pattern. 
    
 12. 
     Variable Length Data Type 
 
   The IPFIX template mechanism is optimized for fixed length 
   Information Elements [IPFIX-INFO]. Where an Information Element has 
   a variable length the following mechanism MUST used to carry the 
   length information. 
    
   In the Template FlowSet the length is recorded as 65535. This 
   reserved length value notifies the Collecting Process that length of 
   the Information Element will be carried in the Information Element 
   itself. 
    
   In most cases the length of the Information Element will be less 
   than 256 bytes. The following length encoding mechanism optimizes 
   the overhead of carrying the Information Element length in this 
   majority case. 
    
   If the length of the Information Element is less than 255 bytes, the 
   length is carried in the first byte of the Information Element. This 
   is shown on Figure A.

     Template Management 
 
   Flow Data records that correspond to a Template Record MAY appear in 
   the same and/or subsequent IPFIX Messages. The Template Record is 
   not necessarily carried in every IPFIX Message. As such, the 
   Collecting Process MUST store the Template Record to interpret the 
   corresponding Flow Data Records that are received in subsequent data 
   messages. 
    
   A Collecting Process that receives IPFIX Messages from several 
   Observation Domains from the same Exporter MUST be aware that the 
   uniqueness of the Template ID is not guaranteed across Observation 
   Domains. 
    
   The Template IDs must remain constant for the life of the Metering 
   Process and the Exporting Process. If the Exporting Process or the 
   Metering Process restarts for any reason, all information about 
   Templates will be lost and new Template IDs will be created. 
   Template IDs are thus not guaranteed to be consistent across an 
   Exporting Process or Metering Process restart. 
 
   A newly created Template record is assigned an unused Template ID 
   from the Exporter. If the template configuration is changed, the 
   current Template ID is abandoned and SHOULD NOT be reused until the 
   Metering Process. If a Collecting Process should receive a new 
   definition for an already existing Template ID, it MUST discard the 
   previous template definition and use the new one. 
 

 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 40] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   If a configured Template Record on the Exporting Process is deleted, 
   and re-configured with exactly the same parameters, the same 
   Template ID COULD be reused. 
 
   The Exporting Process sends the Template FlowSet and Options 
   Template FlowSet under the following conditions: 
     
    1. After a Metering Process restarts, the Exporting Process MUST 
       NOT send any Data FlowSet without sending the corresponding 
       Template FlowSet and the required Options Template FlowSet in a 
       previous message or including it in the same IPFIX Message. It 
       MAY transmit the Template FlowSet and Options Template FlowSet, 
       without any Data FlowSets, in advance to help ensure that the 
       Collector will have the correct Template Record before receiving 
       the first Flow or Options Data Record. 
 
    2. In the event of configuration changes, the Exporting Process 
       SHOULD send the new template definitions at an accelerated rate. 
       In such a case, it MAY transmit the changed Template Record(s) 
       and Options Template Record(s), without any data, in advance to 
       help ensure that the Collector will have the correct template 
       information before receiving the first data. 
 
    3. On a regular basis, the Exporting Process MUST send all the 
       Template Records and Options Template Records to refresh the 
       Collecting Process. Template IDs have a limited lifetime at the 
       Collecting Process and MUST be periodically refreshed. 
       Two approaches are taken to make sure that Templates get 
       refreshed at the Collecting Process: 
          * Every N number of IPFIX Messages. 
          * On a time basis, so every N number of minutes. 
       Both options MUST be configurable by the user on the Exporting 
       Porcess. 
       When one of these expiry conditions is met, the Exporting 
       Process MUST send the Template FlowSet and Options Template.  
    
 14. 
     The Collecting Process's Side 
    
   The Collecting Process receives Template Records from the Exporting 
   Process, normally before receiving Flow Data Records (or Options 
   Data Records). The Flow Data Records (or Options Data Records) can 
   then be decoded and stored locally on the devices. If the Template 
   Records have not been received at the time Flow Data Records (or 
 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 41] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   Options Data Records) are received, the Collecting Process SHOULD 
   store the Flow Data Records (or Options Data Records) and decode 
   them after the Template Records are received. A Collecting Process 
   device MUST NOT assume that the Data FlowSet and the associated 
   Template FlowSet (or Options Template FlowSet) are exported in the 
   same IPFIX Message. 
    
   The Collecting Process MUST NOT assume that one and only one 
   Template FlowSet is present in an IPFIX Message.  
    
   The life of a template at the Collecting Process is limited to a 
   fixed refresh timeout. Templates not refreshed from the Exporting 
   Process within the timeout are expired at the Collecting Process. 
   The Collecting Process MUST NOT attempt to decode the Flow or 
   Options Data Records with an expired Template. At any given time the 
   Collecting Process SHOULD maintain the following for all the current 
   Template Records and Options Template Records: <Exporting Process, 
   Observation Domain, Template ID, Template Definition, Last Received> 
   Note that the Observation Domain is identified by the Source ID 
   field from the IPFIX Message. 
    
   Template IDs are unique per Exporting Process and per Observation 
   Domain.  
    
   If the Collecting Process receives a new Template Record (for 
   example, in the case of an Exporter restart) it MUST immediately 
   override the existing Template Record. 
    
   The Collecting Process MUST note the Field ID of any Information 
   Element that it does not understand and MAY discard the Information 
   Element from the Flow Record. The Collecting Process MUST note the 
   size and position of any Vendor Specified Information Element that 
   it does not understand and discard the Information Element from the 
   Flow Record. 
    
   The Collector MUST accept padding in the Data FlowSet and Options 
   Template FlowSet, which means for the Flow Data Records, the Options 
   Data Records and the Template Records. 
   Refer to the terminology summary table in Section 3.1. 
    
   The IPFIX protocol has a sequence number field in the Export Header 
   which increases with each IPFIX message. A Collector may detect out 
   of sequence, dropped, or duplicate messages by tracking the sequence 
 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 42] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   number. A collector SHOULD provide a logging mechanism for tracking 
   out of sequence messages. Such out of sequence messages may be due 
   to congestion on the network link between the Exporter and 
   Collector, Collector resource exhaustion where it can not process 
   the IPFIX messages at their arrival rate, Exporter resource 
   exhaustion where it can not transmit messages at their creation 
   rate, out of order packet reception, duplicate packet reception, an 
   Exporting Process reset, or an attacker injecting false messages. 
    
 15. 
     Security Considerations 
 
   Because IPFIX can be used to collect billing information and network 
   forensics, confusing or blinding IPFIX must be seen as a prime  
   objective during a sophisticated network attack.  
    
   If an attacker is in a position to inject false messages into an 
   IPFIX message stream this will allow them to send forged flow 
   records, options, or templates. Forged templates may impair the 
   Collectors ability to process any further Flow Records. Forged Flow 
   Records would have a direct effect on the application using the 
   Flows, for example a billing system may generate incorrect billing 
   information. Forged options may be able to alter the meaning of flow 
   records, for example if the sample rate is changed.  
    
   The IPFIX messages themselves may contain information of value to an 
   attacker, and thus care must be taken to confine their visibility to 
   authorized users.  
    
   IPFIX messages can be secured using IPsec. Alternatively if IPFIX 
   runs on top of SCTP or TCP TLS [TLS] can be used. 
    
 15.1 
      IPsec Usage 
    
   To secure messages between the Exporter and the Collector an IPFIX 
   implementation MAY use IPsec. To ensure interworking between 
   Exporters and Collectors from different vendors, the following IPsec 
   profile MUST be supported. This profile is derived from [USEIPSEC]. 

 15.1.1  Selectors 
    
   IPFIX runs between manually configured pairs of hosts on the  
   following transport ports (TBD). The appropriate selector would be 
   Exporter-Collector pairs and port number.  

 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 43] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
    
   Note that, if the Exporter is a router, a non-interface ("loopback") 
   address should be used.   

 15.1.2  Mode 
    
   IPsec MUST be run in transport mode. The AH and ESP MUST be 
   supported by an IPFIX implementation of IPsec.  
    
   The Authentication Header (AH) [RFC2402] MUST be used if 
   authentication is required. The Security Protocol (ESP) [RFC2406] 
   must be used if the is a threat to the IPFIX message content, or if 
   it is confidential.  
    
   Normally in situations where the ESP was required the AH would also 
   be required. If ESP only is used, the sender's IP address MUST be 
   checked against the IP address asserted in the key management 
   exchange. 

 15.1.3  Key Management 
    
   In many networks, manual key management will be sufficient, and this 
   reduces the complexity of the Exporter, albeit at a cost of greater 
   configuration complexity. Manual key management MUST be supported. 
   If a replay attack is considered likely, an automated key management 
   the IKE [IKE] key management system SHOULD be used.  

 15.1.4  Security Policy 
 
   Connections should be accepted only from the designated peer. 

 15.1.5  Authentication 
 
   Given the number of IPFIX capable Exporters that are likely to be 
   deployed by large ISPs, there will be circumstances where shared key 
   mechanisms are not adequate. Where an automated key management 
   system is used, certificate-based IKE SHOULD be supported.   

 15.1.6  Availability 
    
   It is accepted that IPsec will not be universally available in IPFIX 
   Exporters, and that where it is available, there may be issues of 

 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 44] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   throughput, which may itself raise security issues. In such 
   circumstances the other security measures described in this draft 
   provide some threat mitigation.  
    
 15.2 
      TLS Usage 
     
   The IPFIX Exporter initiating a connection acts as a TLS client 
   according to [TLS], and an IPFIX Collector that accepts a connection 
   acts as a TLS server. If mutual authentication is required the IPFIX 
   node acting as TLS server MUST request a certificate from the IPFIX 
   node acting as TLS client, and the IPFIX node acting as TLS client 
   MUST be prepared to supply a certificate on request. 
    
 15.3 
      Protection against DoS attacks 
    
   An attacker may directly mount a DoS attack by generating large 
   amounts of traffic.  If TCP is used for transport, then the flow to 
   the collector would back off due to congestion and eventually stall, 
   blinding the IPFIX system. An attack could then proceed without 
   further observation. SCTP-PR will have a different pathology under 
   such an attack. Stale data at the head of the queue will get flushed 
   giving some visibility of the attack. In case of UDP, IPFIX would 
   reduce to some sort of sampling meaning that some forensics may be 
   left.  
    
   To avoid blinding of the IPFIX system some mechanism for service 
   differentiation can be used to prioritizes IPFIX traffic over user 
   traffic. An alternative is to use a dedicated network for the 
   transport of IPFIX messages. By sending the IPFIX messages over a 
   dedicated network, IPFIX message loss induced by user traffic 
   congestion is minimized. However an attacker may trigger the 
   generation of excessive IPFIX messages, and to avoid information 
   loss during such an attack the IPFIX network must be adequately 
   sized. 
    
 15.4 
      When IPsec or TLS is not an option 
    
   The use of IPsec or TLS might not be an option because of 
   performance  issues.  
    
   Without IPsec or TLS an IPFIX entity has no means to authenticate an 
   IPFIX entity other than the Source IP address. Useful protection is 
   gained by allocating Exporter and Collector IP addresses from ranges 
   that are excluded from use by user traffic and preventing spoofing 
   attacks by proper ingress filtering. Where large numbers of 
 
 
 Claise, et. al             Standard Track                   [Page 45] 
                   IPFIX Protocol Specifications          February 2004 
 
 
   exporters, proxies and collectors are used in a network, it may be 
   tempting for the administrator to not impose source IP address 
   restrictions but this leaves a proxy or collector open to the 
   reception of invalid information. Using an open proxy or collector 
   is therefore to be deprecated.     
    
   If IP address spoofing can not be prevented some level of protection 
   against an insertion attack is required. With a modern 
   implementation of TCP with good ISN randomization [XXX-REFERENCE] or 
   SCTP insertion such attacks are difficult without the ability to 
   snoop the packet flow [XXX-SCTP-BLIND-SPOOFING-REFERENCE]. UDP is 
   vulnerable to insertion attacks however, randomization of the IPFIX 
   sequence number might mitigate this problem. In all these cases, the 
   sequence number space is relatively small giving only limited 
   protection. Therefore a 64 bit cookie [L2TPv3] SHOULD be included as 
   an element within all messages.  
    
   The use of a dedicated network prevents IPFIX messages from being 
   inspected by an attacker. 
    
 15.5 
      Logging an IPFIX Attack 
 
   A Collector may detect problems by tracking the IPFIX sequence 
   number and therefore SHOULD provide a logging mechanism for tracking 
   out of sequence messages. [EDITORS NOTE: Double check whether this 
   is already specified in an earlier section.] Such out of sequence 
   messages may not only be caused by network congestion or 
   Exporter/Collector resource exhaustion but also by an attacker 
   injecting false messages.  
    
   Note that an attacker may be able to exploit the behavior of the 
   Collector when it receives an out of sequence message.  For example 
   a Collector that simply reset the expected sequence number upon 
   receipt of a later message would easily be temporarily blinded by 
   deliberately injecting messages with a much larger sequence number.  
    
   [EDITORS NOTE: the security section may need be adapted to the 
   revised transport section]   
    
 16. 
     IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA will need to set up a registry of Flowset IDs, field types, 
   scope and option codepoints.  
    
   In compiling the registry of field types IANA must set asside a

   range value for vendor use. It is proposed that the range <0..32767> 
   be administered by IANA for IETF defined IEs, and that the range 
   <32768..65535> be allocated for private use by vendors.  
    
   Similarly the scope and option codepoints need to be split between 
   IANA administered and private ranges. 
    
 17. 
     Examples 
    
   Let's consider the example of an IPFIX Message composed of a  
   Template FlowSet, a Data FlowSet (which contains three Flow Data 
   Records), an Options Template FlowSet and a Data FlowSet (which 
   contains 2 Options Data Records).

      Template FlowSet Example 
    
   We want to report the following Field Types: 
   - The source IP address (IPv4), so the length is 4 
   - The destination IP address (IPv4), so the length is 4 
   - The next-hop IP address (IPv4), so the length is 4 
   - The number of bytes of the Flow 
   - The number of packets of the Flow 
    
   Therefore, the Template FlowSet will be composed of the following:
