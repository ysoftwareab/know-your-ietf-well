1.  Overview

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data definition language that was introduced to
   define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows networked
   devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is proving
   relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other interfaces
   (e.g.  ReST) and encodings other than XML (e.g.  JSON) are being
   defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the basis of
   implementation for other interfaces, such as CLI and programmatic
   APIs.

   A core routing data model is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg], and it proposes a basis for the
   development of data models for routing protocols.  The interface data
   model is defined in [RFC7223] and is used for referencing interface
   from the routing protocol.  The key-chain data model is defined in
   [I-D.acee-rtg-yang-key-chain] and is used for referencing key-chains
   configured for authentication and for the enumeration of
   cryptographic algorithms, also used for authentication.  This
   document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure and
   manage OSPF and it is an augment to the core routing data model.

Internet-Draft            OSPF Yang Data Model                March 2015


   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage OSPF.  Both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] are
   supported.  In additional to the core OSPF protocol, features
   described in different separate OSPF RFCs are also supported.  They
   includes demand circuit [RFC1793], traffic engineering [RFC3630],
   multiple address family [RFC5838], graceful restart [RFC3623]
   [RFC5187], NSSA [RFC3101] and sham link [RFC4577].  Those non-core
   features are made optional in the data model provided.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Design of Data Model

   Although the basis of OSPF configuration elements like routers, areas
   and interfaces remains the same, the detailed configuration model
   varies among different vendors.  Differences are observed in term of
   how protocol engine is tied to routing domain, how multiple protocol
   engines could be instantiated and configuration inheritance, just to
   name a few.

   The goal of this document is to define a data model that is capable
   of representing these differences.  There is very little information
   that is designated as "mandatory", providing freedom to vendors to
   adapt this data model to their product implementation.

2.1.  Overview

   The OSPF YANG module defined in this document has all the common
   building blocks for OSPF protocol.

   The OSPF YANG module augments the routing/routing-instance/routing-
   protocols/routing-protocol path of the ietf-routing module.

                +--rw topology* [name]


   The ospf is intended to match to the vendor specific OSPF
   configuration construct which is identified by a local identifier
   'name'.  The field 'version' allows support for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

   The ospf container includes one or more OSPF protocol engines, each
   encapsulated in the instance entity.  Each instance includes
   information for the routing domain it is running on based on the
   [routing-instance af] specification.  There is no default routing
   domain assumed by the data model.  For example, to enable OSPF on the
   default IPv4 routing domain of the vendor, this model requires an
   explicit instance entity with the specification like ["default"
   "ipv4-unicast"].  The instance also contains OSPF router level
   configuration

   The instance/area and instance/area/interface container contain the
   OSPF configuration for the area and interface level respectively

   The instance/topology container contain the OSPF configuration for
   topology when multi-topology feature is enabled

2.2.  OSPFv2 and OSPFv3

   The defined data model supports both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

   The field 'version' is used to indicate the OSPF version and is a
   mandatory.  Based on the version set, the data model change
   accordingly to accommodate the difference between the two versions.

2.3.  Optional Features

   Optional features are features beyond the basic of OSPF
   configurations and it is up to a vendor to decide the support of a
   particular feature on a particular device.

   This module has declared a number of features, such as NSR, max-LSA
   etc..  It is intended that vendors will extend the features list.

2.4.  Inheritance

   This defined data model supports configuration inheritance for
   intances, areas and interfaces.

   The all-instances-inherit, all-areas-inherit and all-interfaces-
   inherit containers provides a consistent way to configure inheritable
   command.  Inheritance is treated as a feature.  Vendors are expected
   to augment the above container to provide the list of inheritance
   command for their implementation.

2.5.  OSPF Router Configuration

   The container ospf is the top level container in this data model.  It
   contains shared information among different OSPF instances under the
   container.

       module: ospf
          +--rw ospf
             +--rw all-instances-inherit {instance-inheritance}?
             |  +--rw area
             |  +--rw interface
             +--rw operation-mode?          identityref
             +--rw instance* [routing-instance af]
                .

2.6.  OSPF Instance Configuration

   The container instance represents an OSPF protocol engine.  Each
   instance indicates the routing domain it is associated with based on
   [routing-instance af] and contains the router level configurations.

   The all-areas-inherit container contains area configuration that
   could be inherited to all OSPF areas defined.  Similarly, the all-
   areas-inherit also contains interface configuration that could be
   inherited to all the OSPF interfaces defined.

2.9.  OSPF notification

   This YANG model defines a list of notifications to inform client of
   important events detected during the protocol operation.  The
   notifications defined cover the common set of traps from OSPFv2 MIB
   [RFC4750] and OSPFv3 MIB [RFC5643].

4.  Security Considerations

   The data model defined does not create any security implications.

   This draft does not change any underlying security issues inherent in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].
