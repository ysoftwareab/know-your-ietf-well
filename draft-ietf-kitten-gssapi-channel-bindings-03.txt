Internet-Draft          GSS-API Channel Bindings           February 2008


Abstract

   This document clarifies and generalizes the Generic Security Services
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) "channel bindings"
   facility, and imposes requirements on future GSS-API mechanisms and
   programming language bindings of the GSS-API.

2.  New Requirements for GSS-API Mechanisms

   Given the publication of RFC5056 we now assert that all new GSS-API
   mechanisms that support channel binding MUST conform to [RFC5056].

3.  Generic Structure for GSS-API Channel Bindings

   The base GSS-API v2, update 1 specification [RFC2743] provides a
   facility for channel binding.  It models channel bindings as an OCTET
   STRING and leaves it to the GSS-API v2, update 1 C-Bindings
   specification to specify the structure of the contents of the channel
   bindings OCTET STRINGs.  The C-Bindings specification [RFC2744]then
   defines, in terms of C, what should have been a generic structure for
   channel bindings.  The Kerberos V GSS mechanism [RFC1964]then defines
   a method for encoding GSS channel bindings in a way that is
   independent of the C-Bindings -- otherwise the mechanism's channel
   binding facility would not be useable with other language bindings.

   In other words, the structure of GSS channel bindings given in
   [RFC2744] is actually generic, rather than specific to the C
   programming language.

   Here, then, is a generic re-statement of this structure, in pseudo-
   ASN.1:

                   GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS := SEQUENCE {
                           initiator-address-type        INTEGER,
                           initiator-address        OCTET STRING,
                           acceptor-address-type   INTEGER,
                           acceptor-address        OCTET STRING,
                           application-data        OCTET STRING,
                   }

   The values for the address fields are described in [RFC2744].

   New language-specific bindings of the GSS-API SHOULD specify a
   language-specific formulation of this structure.

   Where a language binding of the GSS-API models channel bindings as
   OCTET STRINGs (or the language's equivalent), then the implementation
   MUST assume that the given bindings correspond only to the
   application-data field of GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS as shown above, rather
   than some encoding of GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS.

   GSS-API mechanisms MAY use the [RFC1964] encoding of channel
   bindings.

4.  Security Considerations

   For general security considerations relating to channel bindings see
   [RFC5056].

   Language bindings that use OCTET STRING (or equivalent) for channel
   bindings will not support the use of network addresses as channel
   bindings.  This should not cause any security problems, as the use of
   network addresses as channel bindings is not generally secure.
   However, it is important that "end-point channel bindings" not be
   modelled as network addresses, otherwise such channel bindings may
   not be useable with all language bindings of the GSS-API.
