     Abstract 

          The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports both static 
          provisioning of transport paths via an NMS/OSS, and dynamic 
          provisioning of transport paths via a control plane. This 
          document provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic 
          provisioning, and covers control plane signaling, routing, 
          addressing, traffic engineering, path computation, and 
          recovery in the event of network failures. The document 
          focuses on the control of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as the 
          Pseudowire (PW) control plane is not modified by MPLS-TP.  
          MPLS-TP uses GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs. 
          Backwards compatibility to MPLS is required. Management plane, 
          manual configuration, the triggering of LSP setup, label 
          allocation schemes, and hybrid services are out of scope of 
          this document.

     1. Introduction 

        The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is being defined in a joint 
        effort between the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) 
        and the IETF.  The requirements for MPLS-TP are defined in the 
        requirements document, see [TP-REQ].  These requirements state 
        that "A solution MUST be provided to support dynamic 
        provisioning of MPLS-TP transport paths via a control plane."  
        This document provides the framework for such dynamic 
        provisioning. 

     1.1. Scope 

        This document covers control plane related topics for MPLS-TP 
        Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and Pseudowire (PW).  The control 
        plane requirements for MPLS-TP are defined in [TP-REQ]. These 
        requirements defined the role of the control plane in MPLS-TP.  

      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 3] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        In particular, Sections 2.4 and 2.8 of [TP-REQ] provide specific 
        control plane requirements. 

        The LSPs provided by MPLS-TP are used as a server layer for IP, 
        MPLS and PWs, as well as other MPLS-TP LSPs. The PWs are used to 
        carry client signal other than IP and MPLS. The relationship 
        between pseudo wires carried and MPLS-TP LSPs is exactly the 
        same as between pseudo wires and MPLS LSPs in a Packet switched 
        network (PSN). The PW encapsulation over MPLS-TP LSPs used in 
        MPLS-TP networks is the same as for PWs over MPLS in an MPLS 
        network. MPLS-TP also defines protection and restoration (or, 
        collectively, recovery) functions. The MPLS-TP control plane 
        provides methods to establish, remove and control MPLS-TP LSP 
        and PW functions.  This includes control of data plane, OAM and 
        recovery functions. 

        A general framework for MPLS-TP has been defined in [TP-FWK], 
        and a survivability framework for MPLS-TP has been defined in 
        [TP-SURVIVE]. These document scopes the approaches and protocols 
        that will be used as the foundation for MPLS-TP.  Notably, 
        Section 3.5 of [TP-FWK] scopes the IETF protocols that serve as 
        the foundation of the MPLS-TP control plane.  The PW control 
        plane is based on the existing PW control plane, see [RFC4447], 
        and the PW end-to-end (PWE3) architecture, see [RFC3985].  The 
        LSP control plane is based on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS), see 
        [RFC3945], which is built on MPLS-TE and its numerous 
        extensions. [TP-SURVIVE] focuses on LSPs, and the protection 
        functions that must be supported within MPLS-TP. It does not 
        specify which control plane mechanisms to be used. 

        This document discusses the impact of MPLS-TP requirements on 
        the signaling that is used to provision pseudo wires as 
        specified in RFC4447. This document also discusses the impact of 
        the MPLS-TP requirements on the GMPLS signaling and routing 
        protocols that is used to provision MPLS-TP LSPs. 

     1.2. Basic Approach 

        The basic approach taken in defining the MPLS-TP Control Plane 
        framework is: 

        1) MPLS technology as defined by the IETF is the foundation for 
           the MPLS Transport Profile. 
        2) The data plane for MPLS and MPLS-TP is identical, i.e. any 
           extensions defined for MPLS-TP is also applicable to MPLS. 
           And the same encapsulation used for MPLS over any layer 2 
           network is also used for MPLS-TP. 

      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 4] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        3) MPLS PWs are used as-is by MPLS-TP including the use of 
           targeted-LDP for PW signaling [RFC4447], OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE or 
           MP-BGP as they apply for (MS)-PW routing. However, the PW can 
           be encapsulated over an MPLS-TP LSP in (established using 
           methods and procedures for MPLS-TP LSP establishment) in 
           addition to the present defined methods of carrying PWs over 
           packet switched networks (PSNs). That is, the MPLS-TP domain 
           is a packet switched network from PWE3 architecture aspect 
           [RFC3985].  
        4) The MPLS-TP LSP control plane builds on the GMPLS control 
           plane as defined by the IETF for transport LSPs, the 
           protocols within scope are RSVP-TE [RFC3473], OSPF-TE 
           [RFC4203][RFC5392], and ISIS-TE [RFC5307][RFC5316].  
        5) Existing IETF MPLS and GMPLS RFCs and evolving Working Group 
           Internet-Drafts should be reused wherever possible. 
        6) If needed, extensions for the MPLS-TP control plane should 
           first based on the existing and evolving IETF work, secondly 
           based on work by other Standard bodies only when IETF decides 
           that the work is out of IETF scope. New extensions may be 
           defined otherwise.  
        7) Extensions to the GMPLS control plane may be required in 
           order to fully automate MPLS-TP functions. 
        8) Control-plane software upgrades to existing equipment running 
           MPLS is acceptable and expected. 
        9) It is permissible for functions present in the GMPLS control 
           plane not to be used in MPLS-TP networks, e.g. the 
           possibility to merge LSPs. 
        10) One possible use of the control plane is to configure, enable 
           and empower OAM functionality; this will require extensions 
           to existing control plane specifications.  
         
     1.3. Reference Model 

        The control plane reference model is based on the general MPLS-
        TP reference model as defined in MPLS-TP framework [TP-FWK]. Per 
        MPLS-TP framework [TP-FWK], MPLS-TP control plane is based on 
        GMPLS with RSVP-TE for LSP signaling and LDP for PW signaling. 
        In both cases, OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE is used for dynamic routing.   
         
        From a service perspective, client interfaces are provided for 
        both the PWs and LSPs.  PW client interfaces are defined on an 
        interface technology basis, e.g., Ethernet over PW [RFC4448]. In 
        the context of MPLS-TP LSP, the client interface is expected to 


      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 5] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        be provided via a UNI, [RFC4208].  As discussed in [TP-FWK], 
        MPLS-TP also presumes an LSP NNI reference point.  
         
        The MPLS-TP end-to-end control plane reference model is shown in 
        Figure 1.  It shows the control plane protocols used by MPLS-TP, 
        as well as the UNI and NNI reference points.

        Figure 2 adds three hierarchical LSP segments, labeled as "H-
        LSPs". These segments are present to support OAM and MEPs within 
        each provider and across the inter-provider NNI.  The MEPs are 
        used to collect performance information and support OAM 
        triggered survivability schemes as discussed in [TP-SURVIVE], 
        and each H-LSP may be protected using any of the schemes 
        discussed in [TP-SURVIVE].

        While not shown in the Figures above, it is worth noting that 
        the MPLS-TP control plane must support the addressing separation 
        and independence between the data, control and management planes 
        as shown in Figure 3 of [TP-FWK].  Address separation between 
        the planes is already included in GMPLS.  
      
     2. Control plane requirements  

        The requirements for the MPLS-TP control plane are derived from 
        the MPLS-TP requirements and framework documents, specifically

        requirements are summarized in this section, but do not replace 
        those documents.  If there are differences between this section 
        and those documents, those documents shall be considered 
        authoritative.

             data plane. 

         6.  A control plane must be defined for MPLS-TP, but its use 
             is a network operator's choice.  

         7.  A failure of the control plane must not interfere with the 
             deliver of service or recovery of established transport 
             paths.

        Note that the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework document, [TP-
        SURVIVE], provides additional useful information related to 
        recovery. 

         25. The MPLS-TP control plane mechanisms used for P2P and P2MP

         26. The MPLS-TP control plane must support recovery mechanisms 
             that are applicable at various levels throughout the 
             network including support for link, path segment and end-
             to-end path, and pseudowire segment, and end-to-end 
             pseudowire recovery. 

         27. The MPLS-TP control plane must support recovery paths that 
             meet the SLA protection objectives of the service. 
             Including:

             that are applicable to any topology. 

         29. The MPLS-TP control plane must operate in synergy with 
             (including coordination of timing) the recovery mechanisms 
             present in any underlying server transport network (for 
             example, Ethernet, SDH, OTN, WDM) to avoid race conditions 
             between the layers. 

         30. The MPLS-TP control plane must support priority logic to 
             negotiate and accommodate coexisting requests (i.e., 
             multiple requests) for protection switching (e.g., 
             administrative requests and requests due to link/node 
             failures). 

         31. The MPLS-TP control plane must support recovery and 
             reversion mechanisms that prevent frequent operation of 
             recovery in the event of an intermittent defect.

         36. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the sharing of 
             resources between a restoration LSP and the LSP being

         49. The MPLS-TP control plane must support signaling of 
             recovery administrative control. 

         50. The MPLS-TP control plane must support protection state

         51. The MPLS-TP control plane must support transport services 
             that provide differentiated services and different traffic

             different traffic. 

         52. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the provisioning of 
             services that provide a guaranteed of Service Level 
             Specifications (SLS), with support for hard and relative

         53. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the provisioning of 
             services which are sensitive to jitter and delay. 

     2.2. MPLS-TP Framework Derived Requirements 

        The following additional requirements are based on [TP-FWK]: 

         54. The address spaces used in the management, control and 
             data planes are independent. 

         55. Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is disabled on MPLS-TP LSPs 
             by default. The applicability of PHP to both MPLS-TP LSPs 
             and MPLS networks general providing packet transport 
             services will be clarified in a future version.  

         56. The MPLS-TP control plane must support both E-LSP and L-
             LSP. 

         57. The MPLS-TP control plane is based on the MPLS control 
             plane for pseudowires, and more specifically, LDP is used 
             for PW signaling.  

         58. Both single-segment and multi-segment PWs shall be 
             supported by the MPLS-TP control plane.  MPLS-TP shall use 
             the definition of multi-segment PWs that is under 
             development in the IETF independent from MPLS-TP. 

         59. The MPLS-TP control plane is based on the GMPLS control 
             plane for MPLS-TP LSPs. More specifically, GMPLS RSVP-TE 
             is used for LSP signaling, and GMPLS OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE 
             are used for routing.

     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

         60. The MPLS-TP LSP control plane must allow for 
             interoperation with the MPLS-TE LSP control plane. 

         61. The MPLS-TP control plane must be capable of performing 
             fast restoration in the event of network failures. 

         62. The MPLS-TP control plane must ensure its own 
             survivability and to enable it to recover gracefully from 
             failures and degradations.  These include graceful restart 
             and hot redundant configurations. 

         63. The MPLS-TP control plane must support linear, ring and 
             meshed protection schemes. 

     2.3. OAM Framework Derived Requirements 

        The following additional requirements are based on [TP-OAM]: 

         64. The MPLS-TP control plane must allow for the use of OAM 
             proactive Continuity Check (CC) and Connectivity 
             Verification (CV) function. 

               a. The CC and CV functions operate between MEPs. 

               b. All OAM packets coming to a MEP source are tunneled 
                  via label stacking, and therefore a MEP may only be 
                  present at an LSP's ingress and egress nodes (and 
                  never at an LSP's transit node). 

               c. The CC and CV functions may serve as a trigger for 
                  protection switching, see requirement 45 above. 

               d. This implies that LSP hierarchy must be used in cases 
                  where OAM is used to trigger recovery.  

         65. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the configuration 
             of MEPs. 

         66. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the signaling of 
             the transmission period and the ME identifier used in CC 
             and CV. 

     2.4. Security Requirements 

        There are no specific MPLS-TP control plane security 
        requirements. The existing framework for MPLS and GMPLS security 
        is documented on [MPLS-SEC] and that document applies equally to 
        MPLS-TP.

     3. TE LSPs 

        [Editor's note:  This section (and the remainder of this 
        document) is preliminary and will be edited/replaced in future 
        versions.] 

     3.1. General reuse of existing GMPLS control plane mechanisms 

        As described in [RFC3945], Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS 
        to support additional switching technologies. GMPLS is thus 
        capable of controlling packet technologies. Most of the initial 
        efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been related to 
        delivering circuit connectivity. With the emergence of both 
        multi-switching environments and the integrated control 
        paradigm, there is a need to clarify the applicability of GMPLS 
        to packet switching technologies. In particular, the formal 
        definition of FAs and hierarchy in [RFC4206] led to the 
        definition of four regions for PSC (Packet Switching Capable) 
        interfaces: PSC-1, PSC-2, PSC-3, and PSC-4.  

        This document describes the GMPLS topics specifically related to 
        Packet technologies. In particular, it will present how to 
        signal packet- LSPs and how the four PSC-i regions could be 
        used. 

     3.1.1.  "In-band" and "out of band"  

        For an MPLS-TP network, "in-band" is defined such that the 
        control plane runs over a network set up by that same control 
        plane. 

        For an MPLS-TP network, "out of band" is defined such that the 
        control plane runs over a network that has been established by 
        other means than the control plane itself. 

        The term out-of-band is typically refers to the relationship of 
        the management and control planes relative to the data plane.  
        It may be used to refer to the management plane independent of 
        the control plane, or to both of them in concert.  There are 
        multiple uses of the term out-of-band, and it may relate to a 
        channel, a path or a network.  Each of these can be used 
        independently or in combination.  Briefly, the terms are 
        typically used as follows: 

        o In-band  
          This term is used to refer to cases where management and/or 
          control plane traffic is sent using or embedded in the same 
          communication channel used to transport the associated data. 
          IP forwarded, MPLS packet, and Ethernet networks are all 
      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 14] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

          examples where control traffic is typically sent in-band with 
          the data traffic. 

        o Out-of-band, in-fiber  
          This term is used to refer to cases where management and/or 
          control plane traffic is sent using a different communication 
          channel from the associated data traffic, and the 
          control/management communication channel resides in the same 
          fiber as the data traffic. Optical transport networks 
          typically operate in an out-of-band in-fiber configuration. 

        o Out-of-band, aligned topology  
          This term is used to refer to the cases where management 
          and/or control plane traffic is sent using a different 
          communication channel from the associated data traffic, and 
          the control/management communication must follow the same 
          node-to-node path as the data traffic.  Such topologies are 
          usually supported using a parallel fiber or other 
          configuration where multiple data channels are available and 
          one is (dynamically) selected as the control channel. 

        o Out-of-band, independent topology  
          This term is used to refer to the cases where management 
          and/or control plane traffic is sent using a different 
          communication channel from the associated data traffic, and 
          the control/management communication may follow a path that is 
          completely independent of the data traffic.  Such 
          configurations don't preclude the use of in-fiber or aligned 
          topology links, but alignment is not required. 
           

        In the context of MPLS-TP, requirement 4 can be met using out-
        of-band in-fiber or aligned topology types of control.  
        Requirement 5 can only be met by using Out-of-band, independent 
        topology.  GMPLS routing and signaling can be used to support 
        in-band and all of the out-of-band forms of control, see 
        [RFC3945].   

     3.1.2. Addressing  

        MPLS-TP uses the IPv4 and IPv6 address families to identify 
        MPLS-TP nodes by default for network management and signaling 
        purpose. The separation of the control and management planes 
        from the data plane allows each plane to be independently 
        addressable.  Each plane may use addresses that are not mutually 
        reachable, e.g., it is likely that the data plane will not be 
        able to reach an address from the management or control planes 
        and vice versa.  Each plane may also use a different address 
        family.  It is even possible to reuse addresses in each plane,

     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        but this is not recommended as it is likely lead to operational 
        confusion. 

        Unnumbered interfaces and links are also permitted and usage is 
        at the discretion of the network operator. 

     3.2. Signaling 

        In this section, we reference the existing MPLS and GMPLS 
        signaling and routing mechanisms which can be used to support 
        MPLS-TP LSPs. When controlling a packet-switched data-plane with 
        GMPLS, the packets have an MPLS (see [RFC3032]) format, with the 
        so-called "shim header" including a 20-bit label. Unlike MPLS, 
        GMPLS uses the Generalized Label Object defined in [RFC3471] to 
        signal such labels. 

        In the current RSVP-TE signaling protocol, many objects make use 
        of the Generalized Label. 

        According to [RFC3471], a Generalized Label has the following 
        format: "Generic MPLS labels and Frame Relay labels are encoded 
        right justified aligned in 32 bits (4 octets). ATM labels are 
        encoded with the VPI right justified in bits 0-15 and the VCI 
        right justified in bits 16-31". This is primarily used in RESV 
        messages to encode the downstream assigned label which shall be 
        used on a link or FA of an LSP, using the LABEL object (class = 
        16). When the C-Type is set to 2, this LABEL object is carrying 
        a Generalized Label encoded as defined in [RFC3471]. 

        When a node wishes to restrict the set of labels possibly 
        assigned by its downstream neighbour (for the LSP), it can use 
        the LABEL_SET object in PATH messages: the Label Type must be 
        set to "Generalized Label" (value=2) and the Sub-Channels must 
        be such Generalized Labels. 

        The SUGGESTED_LABEL, RECOVERY_LABEL and UPSTREAM_LABEL objects 
        (respectively, class = 129, 34, 35; C-Type = 2) of the PATH 
        messages have an identical format to that of the Generalized 
        Label Object. 

        Similarly, the RECORD_ROUTE object of the PATH message can 
        record the labels which are used along the LSP, using the label 
        subobject TLV (type = 3). In this subobject, the C-type of the 
        recorded label is copied (value is therefore 2 in the packet 
        case), and the Label Object is copied into the appropriate 
        field. 

        The Generalized Label Request Object must be used in PATH 
        messages (C-Type = 4) instead of the simple Label Request

        without range such as defined in [RFC3209] (C-Type = 1). In this 
        object the Switching Type is then set to PSC-1, PSC-2, PSC-3 or 
        PSC-4 (respectively values 1 to 4) according to the type of LSP 
        being opened (see Section 3). 

        The ACCEPTABLE_LABEL_SET object (Class= 130, C-Type = 1) of the 
        PathErr message has an identical format to that of the LABEL_SET 
        object of PATH messages. 

        An MPLS-TP domain may be a switching point for an LSP that 
        extends between client network islands. In this case, the MPLS-
        TP domain edge that connects to the respective client domain may 
        have a static switching in the data plane done on the interface 
        connecting to the respective client node. Alternatively, the LSP 
        may be signaled between the client network and the MPLS-TP 
        domain. There are two cases: (1) the client network connects via 
        a GMPLS UNI to the MPLS-TP domain with knowledge of the remote 
        MPLS-TP edge node and link that connects to the remote client 
        node or there is some reachability information exchanged between 
        the MPLS-TP domain and the client network via dynamic protocol, 
        or (2) integrated model whereby the client network is an 
        integrated part of the MPLS-TP domain, less likely option in 
        some of the operation environments. 

     3.3. Routing 

        The major extension in the context of routing PSC-LSPs within 
        the GMPLS framework is the use of the various PSC-regions 
        introduced by [RFC3945]. With the introduction of the hierarchy, 
        formally specified in [RFC4206], it is necessary to use PSC-x as 
        Switching Capability (SC) and therefore, the nesting process is 
        modified with regards to the MPLS procedures. In particular, the 
        policy chosen for announcing the SC associated with a Forwarding 
        Adjacency has a significant impact. That is an MPLS-TP announced 
        as an FA in a client network in an integrated model to support 
        hierarchical MPLS-TP in MPLS-TP domain.  

     3.3.1. ISIS-TE/OSPF-TE routing in support of MPLS-TP 

        The major extension in the context of routing PSC-LSPs within 
        the GMPLS framework is the use of the various PSC-regions 
        introduced by [RFC3945]. In MPLS, no hierarchy being formally 
        defined, no limitations were applied on nesting packet LSPs 
        within other packet LSPs. With the introduction of the 
        hierarchy, formally specified in [RFC4206], it is necessary to 
        use PSC-x as Switching Capability (SC) and therefore, the 
        nesting process is modified with regards to the MPLS procedures. 
        In particular, the policy chosen for announcing the SC 
        associated with a Forwarding Adjacency has a significant impact.

     3.3.1.1. ISIS-TE/OSPF-TE routing for MPLS-TP 

        Per [RFC4203] for OSPF and [RFC5307] for IS-IS, the Interface 
        Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) is a sub-TLV (of type 15) 
        of the Link TLV, which is used to indicate the Switching 
        Capability (or Capabilities) of an interface. Per [RFC4203], 
        this TLV indicates encoding, MTU and bandwidth available at each 
        priority level. The TLV also carries a Switching Capability 
        field which indicates the switching hierarchy level: 

        1: Packet-Switch Capable-1 (PSC-1) 

        2: Packet-Switch Capable-2 (PSC-2) 

        3: Packet-Switch Capable-3 (PSC-3) 

        4: Packet-Switch Capable-4 (PSC-4) 

     3.3.1.2. Multiple Switching Capabilities  

        To support interfaces that have more than one ISCD (see Section 
        "Interface Switching Capability Descriptor" of [RFC4202]), the 
        ISCD MAY occur more than once within a single routing protocol 
        link description message. This allows a single packet TE-link or 
        FA to be announced in multiple PSC regions, both as a PSC-1 and 
        PSC-2 for instance. 

        The "regular" packet TE-links (non-FAs) can also be configured 
        to be used by one or several of the regions. A TE-link set to a 
        single PSC-x region will be reserved for establishing PSC-x 
        LSPs, whereas one set to multiple PSC-x, PSC-y and PSC-z regions 
        will be shared by PSC LSPs of these switching types. 

        When a TE-link or an FA is shared among regions, it is important 
        for the nodes receiving traffic over this link/FA to have a 
        single label- space shared across the regions. This is critical 
        for the node to guarantee it will receive packets with different 
        labels in different packet regions, even when they arrive on the 
        same interface. 

        The fact that the label-space must be cross-region is 
        independent from the fact that label-spaces may be per-
        interface, per-tunnel, per-upstream neighbor or per-platform. 

     3.3.1.3. Hierarchy  

        [RFC4206] defines network regions based on switching 
        capabilities. The hierarchy of regions is novel in GMPLS and 

      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 18] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        this section intends to clarify the hierarchy for PSC nodes, and 
        the use of the various PSC-regions. 

        According to [RFC4206], there are four PSC regions which are 
        hierarchically ordered in the following way: PSC-1 < PSC-2 < 
        PSC-3 < PSC-4, that is PSC-1 is the smallest SC and PSC-4 is the 
        largest SC. Let us consider two consecutive nodes of an LSP, 
        such that the first node's SC is PSC-x and the second node's is 
        PSC-y. The first node is said to be at the border of two packet 
        regions, with regard to that LSP, if PSC-y is larger than PSC-x 
        (i.e.: x < y ). Similarly, the second node is said to be at the 
        border of two packet regions, with regard to that LSP, if x > y. 

        According to [RFC4202], "a unidirectional LSP must have the same 
        sets of SCs at both ends". Additionally, such an LSP will only 
        be routed over TE-links and/or FAs which have (at least) that SC 
        (since otherwise, the region crossing would trigger the setup of 
        an FA-LSP, as described in [RFC4206]). This imposes that a PSC-x 
        LSP be setup using only TE-links and/or FAs which include at 
        least PSC-x. In the packet-switching context, this means that a 
        PSC-x cannot directly use links/FAs which do not have a PSC-x 
        set in their ISCD's Switching Capability Field. Therefore, if 
        one wants to establish a PSC-x LSP across a PSC-y region, an FA-
        LSP must either be available or set-up. It may be announced in 
        the PSC-x region routing instance (which may be the same as the 
        PSC-y region routing instance) as a PSC-x TE-link. The SC 
        associated with an FA is announced using the routing protocol's 
        Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) (see Section 
        3.1). For instance, if a PSC-1 LSP has to be setup across a PSC-
        3 region, the region border node will first have to establish a 
        PSC-3 LSP in which the PSC-1 LSP will be nested. The PSC-3 LSP 
        may then be used to announce an FA in the PSC-1 routing 
        protocol. 

        In the four packet regions, the switching principles are the 
        same, which means that a PSC node is most likely to have in fact 
        all four PSC-1, PSC-2, PSC-3 and PSC-4 switching types. When 
        using a packet LSP to nest other LSPs, the policy for deciding 
        which PSCs to announce for the packet FAs and TE-links, and the 
        policy for cross- region LSP triggering determine the type of 
        interactions between the PSC-regions. This means there are in 
        fact multiple ways of using the PSC regions. 

     3.3.2. TE link bundling 

     3.4. OAM, MEP (hierarchy) configuration & control 

        Current MPLS LSP and PW OAM capabilities are not suitable for 
        transport applications. Hence IETF has started work to define a 
      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 19] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        comprehensive set of MPLS-TP OAM functions. Specific OAM 
        requirements for MPLS-TP are documented in [draft-ietf-mpls-tp-
        oam-requirements]. In addition to the actual OAM requirements, 
        it is also required that the control plane is able to configure 
        and control OAM entities. This requirement is not yet addressed 
        by the foreseen MPLS-TP control protocols (i.e, GMPLS for LSPs 
        and T-LDP for PWs).  

        To emphasize the importance of OAM establishment via the control 
        plane it must be noted that for proper OAM; OAM messages and the 
        actual normal traffic must be congruent: taking the same path 
        and relying on the same forwarding decisions at intermediate 
        nodes. Hence, it is desirable that OAM is setup together with 
        the establishment of the data path (i.e., with the same 
        signaling). This way OAM setup is bound to connection 
        establishment signaling, avoiding two separate 
        management/configuration steps (connection setup followed by OAM 
        configuration) which would increases delay, processing and more 
        importantly may be prune to misconfiguration errors. 

        It must be noted that although the control plane is used to 
        establish OAM entities, subsequently OAM is executed 
        independently from the control plane. That is, OAM mechanisms 
        are responsible for monitoring and initiating recovery actions 
        (driving switches between primary and backup paths). 

        GMPLS RSVP-TE based OAM configuration and control should be 
        general to be applicable to a wide range of data plane 
        technologies and OAM solution and not be limited to the MPLS 
        technology and MPLS-TP OAM. On the other hand, GMPLS based OAM 
        configuration must satisfy all MPLS-TP requirements.  

        PW OAM establishment is FFS. 

     3.5. Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation  

        Same approach as MPLS.  Specific algorithms out of scope.  
        Similar to MPLS, but adds bidirectional and recovery path 
        computation. 

     3.5.1. Relation to PCE 

        Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for path computation 
        of a GMPLS LSP across domains and in a single domain. A Network 
        Management System (NMS) may be used to trigger path computation 
        for a GMPLS LSP and configure the cross-connects along the 
        computed path. Alternatively, the path computation may be 
        triggered by a network node via PCE Communication Protocol 
        (PCECP) and the LSP signaled using GMPLS.

     4. Pseudo Wires  

        [Editor's note:  This section is preliminary and will be 
        edited/replaced in future versions.] 

        MPLS Pseudo Wires, as defined in [RFC3985], provide for emulated 
        services over an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN). There are 
        several types of pseudowires: (1) Ethernet PWs providing for 
        Ethernet port or Ethernet VLAN over MPLS [RFC4448], (2) HDLC/PPP 
        Pseudowire providing for HDLCP/PPP leased line transport of 
        MPLS[RFC4618], (3) ATM PWs [RFC4816], (4) Frame Relay PWs 
        [RFC4619], and (5) circulation Emulation PWs [RFC4553].  

        Today's transport networks based on PDH, WDM, or SONET/SDH 
        provide transport for PDH or SONET (e.g., ATM over SONET or 
        Packet PPP over SONET) client signals with no payload awareness. 
        Implementing PW capability allows the use of an existing 
        technology to substitute the TDM transport with Packet-aware 
        transport, using well-defined pseudowire encapsulation methods 
        for carrying various packet services over MPLS, and providing 
        for potentially better bandwidth utilization. 

        There are two types of pseudowires: (1) Single-Segment 
        pseudowires (SS-PW), and (2) Multi-segment pseudowires (MS-PW). 
        An MPLS-TP domain may transport a PW with endpoints within a 
        client network transparently. Alternatively, an MPLS-TP edge 

      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 21] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        node may be the Terminating PE (T-PE) for a PW, performing 
        adaptation from the native attachment circuit technology (e.g. 
        Ethernet 802.1q) to an MPLS PW for transport over an MPLS-TP 
        domain, with a GMPLS LSP or a hierarchy of LSPs transporting the 
        PW between the T-PEs. In this way, the PW is analogous to a 
        transport channel in a TDM network and the LSP is equivalent to 
        a container of multiple non-concatenated channels, albeit they 
        are packet containers. The MPLS-TP domain may also contain 
        Switching PEs (S-PEs) for a multi-segment PW whereby the T-PEs 
        may be at the edge of the MPLS-TP domain or in a client network. 
        In this latter case, a T-PE in a client network is a T-PE 
        performing the adaptation of the native service to MPLS and the 
        MPLS-TP domain performs Pseudo-wire switching. 

        SS-PW signaling control plane is based on LDP with specific 
        procedures defined in [RFC4447]. [Segmented-PW] and [MS-PW] 
        allow for static switching of multi-segment pseudowires in data 
        and control plane and for dynamic routing and placement of an 
        MS-PW whereby signaling is still based on Targeted LDP (T-LDP). 
        The MPLS-TP domain shall use the same PW signaling protocols and 
        procedures for placing SS-PWs and MS-PWs. This will leverage 
        existing technology as well as facilitate interoperability with 
        client networks with native attachment circuits or PW segment 
        that is switched across the MPLS-TP domain.  

        The same control protocol and procedures are reused as much as 
        possible. However, when using PWs in MPLS-TP, a set of new 
        requirements are defined which may require extensions of the 
        existing control mechanisms. This section identifies areas where 
        extensions are needed based on the PW Control Plane related 
        requirements documented in [draft-ietf-mpls-tp-requirements]. 

        The baseline requirement for extensions to support transport 
        applications is that any new mechanisms and capabilities must be 
        able to interoperate with existing IETF MPLS [RFC3031] and IETF 
        PWE3 [RFC3985] control and data planes where appropriate. Hence, 
        extensions of the PW Control Plane must be in-line with the 
        procedures defined in [RFC4447]. 

        For MPLS-TP, it is required that the data and control planes are 
        both logically and physically separated. That is, the PW Control 
        Plane must be able to operate out-of-band (OOB). This ensures 
        that in the case of control plane failures the data plane is not 
        affected and can continue to operate normally. This was not a 
        design requirement for the current PW Control Plane. However, 
        due to the PW concept, i.e., PWs are connecting logical entities 
        ('forwarders'), and the operation of the PW control protocol, 
        i.e., only edge PE nodes (T-PE, S-PE) take part in the signaling 

      
      
     Andersson, et al.     Expires August 22, 2009             [Page 22] 
     Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework    February 2009 
         

        exchanges: moving T-LDP out-of-band seems to be, theoretically, 
        a straightforward exercise. 

        More precisely, if IP addressing is used in the MPLS-TP control 
        plane then T-LDP addressing can be maintained, although all 
        addresses will refer to control plane entities. Both, the PWid 
        FEC and Generalized PWid FEC Elements can possibly be used in an 
        OOB case as well (Detailed evaluation is FFS). The PW Label 
        allocation and exchange mechanisms can be possibly reused 
        unchanged (Detailed evaluation is FFS). Binding a PW to an LSP, 
        or PW segments to LSPs can be left to networks elements acting 
        as T-PEs and S-PEs or a control plane entity that may be the 
        same one signaling the PW. If the control plane is physically 
        separated from the forwarder, the control plane must be able to 
        program the forwarders with necessary information.  

        For transport applications, it is mandatory that bidirectional 
        traffic is following congruent paths. Today, each direction of a 
        PW or a PW segment is bound to a unidirectional LSP that extends 
        between two T-PEs, S-PEs, or a T-PE and an S-PE. The 
        unidirectional LSPs in both directions are not required to 
        following congruent paths, and therefore both directions of a PW 
        may not follow congruent paths. The only requirement today is 
        that a PW or a PW segment shares the same T-PEs in both 
        directions, and same S-PEs in both directions. This poses a new 
        requirement on the PW Control Plane, namely to ensure that both 
        ends map the PW to the same transport path. When a bidirectional 
        LSP is selected on one end to transport the PW, a mechanism is 
        needed that signals to the remote end which LSP has been 
        selected locally to transport the PW. This likely can be 
        accomplished by adding a new TLV to PW signaling. This coincides 
        with the gap identified for OOB support: a new mechanism may be 
        needed to explicitly bind PWs to the supporting transport LSP. 

        Alternatively, two unidirectional LSPs may be used to support 
        the PW. However, to meet the congruency requirement, the LSPs 
        must be placed so that they are forced to follow the same path 
        (switches and links). This maybe accomplished by placing one 
        unidirectional TE-LSP in one direction at one endpoint, and 
        forcing the other endpoint to setup a TE-LSP with an ERO that 
        has the nodes/links in the reverse order from the RRO seen in 
        the path message of the LSP in the reverse direction. In this 
        case, when one endpoint selects an LSP to bind the PW to, it 
        must identify to the remote end which LSP to bind the other 
        direction of the PW to.   

        Transport applications require resource guarantees. In the case 
        of transport LSPs, resource reservation mechanisms are provided 
        via RSVP-TE and the use of DiffServ. If multiple PWs are

        multiplexed into the same transport LSP resources, contention 
        may occur. However, local policy at PEs may ensure proper 
        resource sharing among PWs mapped into a resource guaranteed 
        LSP. On the other hand, it is limited if any guarantees can be 
        provided to PWs if the LSPs used to support MPLS-TP PWs do not 
        support resource guarantees.  

        The PW control plane must be able to establish and configure all 
        of the available features manageable for the PW, including 
        protection and OAM entities and mechanisms. There is ongoing 
        work on PW protection and MPLS-TP OAM.  

        To summarize, the main areas identified for potential PW Control 
        Plane extensions to support MPLS-TP are the following. 

          o Move PW Control Plane out-of-band  

          o Explicit control of PW to LSP binding  

          o PW QoS and congestion control  

          o PW protection  

          o PW OAM configuration and control

        [Editor's note:  This section is preliminary and will be 
        edited/replaced in future versions.] 

        This document is a framework document and does not describe bits 
        on the wire and have a very small impact on MPLS/GMPLS security 
        issues. However it gives guidelines for future extension to 
        existing MPLS and GMPLS protocols, it is understood that the 
        documents that specify these extensions will address the 
        security issues that relates to the extensions. 

        It is also understood that that the MPLS/GMPLS security 
        framework [MPLS-SEC] is applicable to both this document and the 
        documents that will be written as a result of the output of this 
        document.
