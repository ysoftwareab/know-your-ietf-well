                      A JSON format for LGR files
                    draft-schiltknecht-lager-json-00

Abstract

   This document defines a JSON format for LGRs (Label Generation
   Rules).  LGRs are used to represent rules for validating identifier
   labels and their alternate representations.  These LGRs are expressed
   in XML as defined in [I-D.ietf-lager-specification].

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a JSON format for representing LGRs as
   described in [I-D.ietf-lager-specification].

   The key design considerations taken into account in this document are

   o  Round-tripping (converting an XML LGR to JSON and back) will yield
      the same semantic result as the starting point.  All XML elements,
      attributes and values are guaranted to be preserved.

   o  The ordering of elements MUST be preserved, as it is of importance
      in the original LGR XML specification.

   The terms "JSON object", "JSON array", "JSON member", and "JSON
   value" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC7159].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Converting from XML to JSON

   This section explains how to convert an XML LGR to JSON, by defining
   a simple mapping between XML nodes and JSON objects.

2.1.  Basic structure

   As a valid JSON object, the basic layout of an LGR in JSON is as
   follows:

Internet-Draft                JSON for LGR                    March 2016


   {
       "meta": [
           ...
       ],
       "data": [
           ...
       ],
       "rules": [
           ...
       ]
   }

   As expressed in [I-D.ietf-lager-specification], only the "data"
   object is mandatory.

   The conversion scheme follows these general conventions:

   o  Each XML element is a JSON array with 3 members: the name of the
      element (called "name"), a (potentially empty) JSON object
      representing the attributes of the element (called "attributes"),
      and the value of the element (called "value").

   o  The type of the "value" element (last element of the JSON array)
      depends on the context, and will be defined in each of the
      following sections.

   The use of JSON arrays which are ordered sequences allows to keep the
   order of the declarations from the XML.  While this is not strictly
   necessary for the metadata element, this allows consistency of the
   format for each object.

   For example, the XML extract:

   <char cp="0063"/>

   will be converted to

   ["char", {"cp": "0063"}, []]

2.2.  Metadata

   The type of the "value" is a string, except for the "references"
   element where an array of the JSON-converted "reference" child XML
   elements is used.

   Given the following XML "meta" element:

2.3.  Code Points and variants

   All code point data is contained in the "data" section of an LGR.
   There are two types of data:

   o  Code points ("char" elements), which can have variants.

   o  Range of code points ("range" elements), defined by their first
      and last code point, and cannot have variants.

   As a consequence, the type of the "value" is an array, containing the
   variants of a "char" element.  For variants, it is an empty array.

   Typical conversions are described in the following examples:

   <data>
       <char cp="002D"/>
       <range first-cp="0030" last-cp="0039"/>
       <char cp="006C 00B7 006C" comment="Catalan middle dot"/>
   </data>

"data":
[
    ["char", {"cp": "002D"}, []],
    ["range", {"first-cp": "0030", "last-cp": "0039"}, []],
    ["char", {"cp": "006C 00B7 006C", "comment": "Catalan middle dot"}, []]
]

   For variants:

   <char cp="00F6">
       <var cp="006F 0065" type="block"/>
   </char>

   ["char", {"cp": "00F6"}, [
       ["var", {"cp": "006F 0065", "type": "block"}, []]
   ]]

2.4.  Whole Label Rules and actions

   Rules, classes and actions are defined in the "rules" section of an
   LGR, as an array of JSON objets.

   The "value" element will have the following types:

   o  For rules, an array of the rule's match operators.

Internet-Draft                JSON for LGR                    March 2016


   o  For classes, an array of the class' codepoints, or a string if the
      shorthand notation is used.

   o  For actions, an empty array since actions do not have any value or
      child.

3.  Converting from JSON to XML

   When converting a JSON LGR to XML format, proper escaping of text
   content MUST be done.

   An empty "value" (empty list, empty object or empty string) is an XML
   element without value nor child.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   Since JSON is used as a format, the security risks discussed in
   [RFC7159] are to be considered.
