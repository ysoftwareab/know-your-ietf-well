Abstract

   Many kinds of mobile user equipments may want to join or create
   wireless local area network. Today connectivity is usually based on
   using the IP address as the identifier for the device. However, such
   kinds of devices do not necessary have a static IP address. Some
   autoconfiguration procedures are developed for fixed networks, but
   those procedures have requirements that Manet does not satisfy. For
   ad hoc networks, some IPv6 address autoconfiguration solutions are
   developed during recent years.

   In this document, an autoconfiguration mechanism for mobile ad hoc 
   network nodes will be described. A hardware based addressing will be
   presented as one approach to create a temporary IPv6 address.
   Furthermore, a solution for minimizing Duplicate Address Detection
   procedures while generating a globally unique IPv6 address will be
   explained.

1. Introduction

   Many kinds of mobile user equipment may want to join or create
   wireless local area network at any specific time. Today connectivity
   is usually based on using the IP address as an identifier for
   the device. However, such devices do not necessarily have a static IP
   address and thus, they can not participate in mobile ad hoc networks
   directly. In this document, an autoconfiguration mechanism for mobile
   ad hoc network (Manet) nodes is described. Furthermore, a solution
   for generating a globally unique IPv6 address without Duplicate
   Address Detection is specified. IPv6 address is hereafter referred as
   "IP address".

Internet Draft      Ad Hoc Address Autoconfiguration      26 August 2003


   Some autoconfiguration procedures like Zeroconf [2] and IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [8] are developed for fixed
   networks, but those procedures have requirements that Manet does not
   satisfy. An existing solution of IP address autoconfiguration for
   mobile ad hoc network is described in [6], but it is isolated from
   Internet connectivity. The solution described in this document
   specifies the autoconfiguration procedure, address management and 
   address releasing. Specifically, these mechanisms are described for
   mobile ad hoc networks using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
   routing protocol. The autoconfiguration procedure of this document
   follows partly [6]. The solution as described in [9] is used for
   interoperability for global connectivity.


2. Applicability Statement

   The applicabilities and limitations of the mechanisms described below
   have to be explained for avoiding misunderstandings. Some assumptions
   have been done and they are explained in this section. A single node
   can join a network or leave the network at arbitrary time, but
   network partitions and healings are out of scope. These situations
   are subjects for further research. Furthermore, the internet-gateway
   can be failed and in that case all global addresses in appropriate
   Manet MUST be released as described in [9]. One important assumption
   is that the prefix length of Manet IP address MUST be equal or
   greater than the prefix length of global IP address. If the prefix
   length of Manet is greater than the prefix length of global IP 
   address, the padding is needed. Otherwise the DAD MUST run again for
   Manet or Global address.


3. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].  This
   section defines other terminology used with AODV that is not already 
   defined in [3].

      Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

         The process by which a node, which lacks an IP address,
         determines whether a candidate address it has selected is
         available. A node already equipped with an IP address
         participates in DAD in order to protect its own or its
         neighbor's IP address from being accidentally misappropriated
         for use by another node [6]. In this document the DAD MUST be 
         processed for interface ID, not the whole IP address.

Internet Draft      Ad Hoc Address Autoconfiguration      26 August 2003
      

      Address Request (AREQ)

         The message used during address discovery to request
         the tentative address as its own IP address [6].

      Address Reply (AREP)

         The message used during address discovery to indicate
         the requested address is already utilised [6].

      Temporary Address

         Temporary address is basically a hardware-based address that is
         used as a source address for sending the AREQ messages.
         The temporary address is used only in uniqueness check to
         ensure that the generated IP address differs from other IP
         addresses in the same Manet.

      Temporary flag

         New flag is determined for routing table entry. This informs
         that an IP address is under autoconfiguration procedure.

      Tentative address

         The IP address, which Manet node wishes to use as an identifier
         in Manet. The tentative address consists of Manet prefix and
         randomly generated interface ID.

      Internet-Gateway

         A route, which provides Internet connectivity for nodes in
         Manet [9].

      Internet-gateway information

         The Gateway's IP routing prefix, prefix length, and lifetime.

      Manet IP address

         A Manet node's identifier in Manet. The Manet IP address
         consists of Manet prefix and unique interface ID. The address
         is used for ad hoc routing and its scope is site local.

      Global IP address

         A node's IPv6 address in Internet. The Global IP address
         consists of gateway's IP routing prefix and unique interface
         ID. The address identifies the mobile node, and is used for
         Internet communication.

Internet Draft      Ad Hoc Address Autoconfiguration      26 August 2003


       Interface ID

         The unique postfix of IPv6 address. The IPv6 address consists
         of prefix and interface ID. The length of interface ID =
         128bits - prefix length.


4. Overview
   
   The solution described in this document consists of initial
   configuration of new Manet node i.e. assignment of an unique Manet IP
   address, assignment of an unique global IP address, management of
   previously mentioned addresses and releasing the assigned address. 
   When the node wishes to join in Manet, it first creates a hardware
   based temporary address. This address is used only in uniqueness
   check to ensure that the generated IP address differs from other IP
   addresses in the same Manet. Second, the node generates a Manet IP
   address, called tentative address, by using the Manet prefix and
   randomly generated interface ID. Then the node starts
   an autoconfiguration procedure to assign the tentative address.
   The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is processed only for the
   interface ID of Manet IP address, not the whole IP address. 

   If Manet is attached to the Internet via internet-gateway, the node
   can get the Internet gateway information as described in [9].
   The global IP address is generated by using the previously mentioned
   unique tested interface ID and gateway's IP routing prefix, which is 
   included in the internet-gateway information. The DAD does not need
   to be run for the global IP address, because the interface ID is
   unique and it will not be changed.

   The releasing procedure of the IP address is different for global IP
   addresses and Manet IP addresses. If internet-gateway fails or
   the node wants to release the global IP address, the node can assign
   the Manet IP address with the same interface ID than the global
   address without new DAD. This minimizes the DAD procedures. Releasing
   of Manet IP address is very simple, because the unused IP address is
   erased from the neighbor's routing table after timer expiration.

6. IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration

   In this section, the specific steps that an IPv6 Manet node will take
   when autoconfiguring an address to its interface, will be described.
   The suggestion for DAD is given in subclauses 6.1 -6.4. The DAD
   suggested is based on IP Address Autoconfiguration [6] and Zeroconf
   [5], but with changes, which are described in the text.


6.1. Hardware Based Temporary Address

   A hardware based addressing is one possible approach to create an IP
   address. It can be argued that all the Ethernet cards have globally
   unique addresses by using the 48-bit IEEE assigned unique MAC (Medium
   Access Control) addresses. Furthermore, every GSM has unique device
   identifier IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) code, in
   which the creation of hardware-based IP address could be based.
   However, some communication card solutions of handheld mobile do not
   have unique address. Thus this approach is not such reliable as is
   needed and hardware address based solution for a globally unique
   address has limitations. Nevertheless, the hardware address can be
   used as a temporary address with an identification number in address
   autoconfiguration. The hardware address can be used even though its
   scope is link-local because it is used only for sending the AREQ and
   the address shows up only for the next hop nodes.


6.2 Address Request (AREQ)

   When an IP node performs Manet address autoconfiguration, a temporary
   address is used for the sole use of AREQ-AREP protocol messages
   exchange for the uniqueness check of the chosen IP address. The node
   creates an IP address by using the MANET_PREFIX, reserved for this
   purpose, and randomly generated interface ID. The prefix length of
   MANET_PREFIX is 64 bits and the length of interface ID is 128 bits -
   Manet prefix length = 64 bits. Hereby generated requested IP address
   is also called a tentative address. After this, the node processes
   uniqueness check to requested IP address, as specified below.

   To check for address uniqueness, the node sends an Address Request
   (AREQ). The AREQ modification contains an identification number,
   a sequence number and hop count. The identification number is
   generated randomly. It will serve as an identifier to the requested
   IP address. The sequence number is associated with the sending times
   of AREQ. It will be increased when the AREQ is sent all over again.
   Message format for IPv6 AREQ is given in section 5.1. The node sends
   an Address Request to its neigbors and sets a timer for
   ADDRESS_DISCOVERY milliseconds. If the tentative address is already
   in use within the reachable Manet, the node expects to receive
   an Address Reply (AREP).

Internet Draft      Ad Hoc Address Autoconfiguration      26 August 2003


6.3. Address Request Processing

   The AREQ messages are processed as follows:

   - The node compares its own IP address and Requested_IPv6_Address. If
     the addresses are the same the node MUST reply to the packet with
     AREP immediately.
   - If not, the node looks up its routing table for the entry with
     Requested_IPv6_Address. If the entry is not found from it's routing
     table:
      1. The node enters a new entry to its routing table. The entry's
         dest_addr is tentative_addr, next_hop is ip_src and
         the temporary flag is set.
      2. The node adds a pair {Requested_IPv6_Address,
         AREQ_Identification_Number} with timer to its temporary
         buffered list for message identifiers.
      3. The node forwards AREQ.

   - If the entry is found from the routing table, the node checks
     the state of entry. If the temporary flag is set, the node checks
     its buffered list:
      - If the pair {Requested_IPv6_Address, AREQ_Identification_Number}
        is not found from the buffered list, the node MUST reply to
        the packet with AREP immediately.
      - If the pair {Requested_IPv6_Address, AREQ_Identification_Number}
        is found from the buffered list, the node proceeds as follows:
         1. If (areq->sequence_number > entry->sequence_number) or
            ((areq->sequence_number = entry->sequence_number) and
            (areq->hop_count < entry->hop_count))
	         Then update routing table and forward AREQ;
         2. If ((areq->sequence_number = entry->sequence_number) and
            (areq->hop_count >= entry->hop_count))
               Then destroy message;
         3. If (areq->sequence_number < entry->sequence_number)
               Then destroy message;
 
   - If the state of entry with Requested_IPv6_address is active or
     invalid, the node MUST reply to the packet with AREP immediately.

   When a node receives an AREQ message, the node first compares
   the requested IP address and its own IP address. If the requested
   address differs from its own IP address, the node checks its routing
   table. If the entry with requested IP address is not found from
   the routing table, the node creates a reverse route entry for
   the node indicated by the requested IP address field. The node adds
   entry with the requested IPv6 address to its routing table and uses
   the node from which it received the AREQ as a next hop towards

   the source node. The state of this entry is set as temporary i.e.
   the temporary flag is set. The node enters a lifetime for this route
   as REVERSE_ROUTE_LIFETIME. In this way, if the node later receives
   an AREP, it will be able to forward the AREP towards the source node.
   In addition, the pair {Requested_IPv6_Address,
   AREQ_Identification_Number} is added with timer to node's temporary
   buffered list for message identifiers. After timer expiration,
   the pair {Requested_IPv6_Address, AREQ_ Identification_Number} is
   purged from the list. These two values and AREQ sequence number serve
   to identify the request uniquely. Finally the node forwards the AREQ.

   If the entry with requested IP address is found from the routing
   table, the node checks the state of this entry. If the temporary flag
   is set, the node looks up its temporary buffered list. If the pair
   {Requested_IPv6_Address, AREQ_Identification_Number} is not found
   from the list, the requested IP address is already in use in another
   AREQ process and the node MUST reply to the packet with AREP
   immediately. If the pair is found from the list, the node has seen
   this AREQ before. To determine either to update the routing table or
   destroy the AREQ, the node proceeds as follows: the routing table is
   updated only if new AREQ sequence number is greater than the one in
   the routing table or both sequence numbers are the same but new hop
   count is smaller than the hop count in the routing table. If the
   routing table is updated, the node forwards the AREQ immediately
   afterwards. Otherwise, the node destroys the duplicate AREQ.

   On the other hand, if the node has the same IP address as that in
   the AREQ or the node finds the same IP address from its routing table
   with the state as active or invalid, the node MUST reply to
   the packet immediately. First, the node creates an Address Reply
   (AREP) packet. The packet format for the AREP is presented in
   section 5.2. Then the node copies the requested IPv6 address, AREQ
   identification number and AREQ sequence number from the AREQ message,
   and places them in the AREP. After that the node unicasts this packet
   to the source node, as indicated by the source IP address in the IP
   header of the received AREQ message. The reverse route that was
   created by the AREQ process is used to unicast the AREP back to
   the source node.


6.4. Address Reply Processing

   When a node originates an AREQ, it sets a timer for ADDRESS_DISCOVERY
   milliseconds. When the ADDRESS_DISCOVERY timer expires, the node
   increases its sequence number with one and repeats the process
   AREQ_RETRIES times waiting for responses. If all attempts fail with
   timer expiration, the node concludes that the requested address is
   unique in Manet and the requested address can safely be set as its
   own.

   On the other hand, if the node receives an AREP within the discovery
   period, and if the requested IP address and AREP identification
   number match to it's recorded values, another node within the ad hoc
   network is currently using that requested IP address. In this case,
   the node randomly picks another tentative IP address, generates
   randomly AREQ identification number and begins the DAD procedure
   again. However, if both the requested IPv6 address and the AREP
   identification number do not match to the node's recorded values,
   the AREP is addressed to another node.


7. Global Connectivity

   The interoperability for global connectivity is described in [9].


8. Security Considerations

   This document does not define any method for secure operation of
   the autoconfiguration protocol.  The danger exists that a malicious
   node may pretend to have any given IP address, so that another node
   would receive AREP messages apparently denying it the use of whatever
   address it might choose.  This lack of security is problematic for
   many approaches to IP address autoconfiguration.  It is symptomatic
   of the basic conflict between security, and operation in any mode
   where preconfigured information (including security association data)
   is not available.


9. Configuration Parameters

   This section gives default values for some important values
   associated with address discovery protocol operations.
