Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
   the Proxy Mobile-IPv6 MIB, for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community.  In particular, the Proxy Mobile-IPv6 MIB
   will be used to monitor and control the mobile access gateway node
   and the local mobility anchor functions of a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
   entity.

Internet Draft                  pmip6MIB                       July 2008


1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

2.1.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol and entities
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [PMIPv6] is an extension to the Mobile IPv6
   protocol which facilitates network-based localized mobility
   management (NETLMM) of IPv6 nodes in a PMIPv6 domain.  to remain
   reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.
2.2.  Terminology
   The terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification[RFC3775]
   and in NETLMM Goals document [RFC4831].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements

   For managing a PMIPv6 entity it is necessary to monitor
   the following:
       o capabilities of PMIPv6 entities
       o traffic due to PMIPv6
       o binding related statistics (at LMA and MAG)
       o binding related details (at LMA agent and MAG)
       o history of Binding Updates (at LMA agent and MAG)

4.  MIB Design.

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible
   and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the
   essential needs of monitoring and control are met.

   It is assumed that the Proxy Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base
   (PMIPV6-MIB) will always be implemented in conjunction with the
   MOBILEIPV6-MIB.

      The PMIPV6-MIB comprises of the following primary groups:

      o  pmip6System

      o  pmip6Configuration

      o  pmip6Stats

      o  pmip6Notifications

      o  pmip6Conformance

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and the corresponding
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a base arc in the 'mib-2' (standards track) OID
   tree for the 'pmip6MIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the PMIPv6 MIB.
