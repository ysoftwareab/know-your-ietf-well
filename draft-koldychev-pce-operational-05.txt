1.  Introduction

   The PCEP protocol started off being purely stateless with PCReq and
   PCReply messages, as described in Path Computation Element (PCE)
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].  Stateless PCEP operates in
   a "pull" model, i.e., PCC has to periodically ask the PCE for updates
   to the path, even if the path has not changed.

   Stateful PCEP was later introduced in PCEP Extensions for the
   Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231].  Stateful PCEP operates in a "push"
   model, where the PCC can register with PCE to receive future updates
   about the path, and there is no need to ask the PCE periodically.

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION              February 2022


   The current document serves to optimize the original procedure in
   [RFC8231] to drop the PCReq and PCReply exchange, which greatly
   simplifies implementation and optimizes the protocol.

   Due to different interpretations of PCEP standards, it was found that
   implementations often had to adjust their behavior in order to
   interoperate.  The current document serves to clarify certain aspects
   of PCEP to make it easier to produce interoperable implementations of
   PCEP.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   MBB:  Make-Before-Break.  A procedure during which the head-end of a
      traffic-engineered path wishes to move traffic to a new path
      without losing any traffic, by first "making" a new path and then
      "breaking" the old path.

   Association parameters:  As described in [RFC8697], the combination
      of the mandatory fields Association type, Association ID and
      Association Source in the ASSOCIATION object uniquely identify the
      association group.  If the optional TLVs - Global Association
      Source or Extended Association ID are included, then they MUST be
      included in combination with mandatory fields to uniquely identify
      the association group.

   Association information:  As described in [RFC8697], the ASSOCIATION
      object could also include other optional TLVs based on the
      association types, that provides 'information' related to the
      association type.

   ERO:  Explicit Route Object is the path of the LSP encoded into a
      PCEP object.  To represent an empty ERO object, i.e., without any
      subobjects, we use the notation "ERO={}".  To represent an ERO
      object containing some given sequence of subobjects, we use the
      notation "ERO={A}".

3.  PCEP LSP Database

   We introduce the concept of the LSP-DB, as a database of actual LSP
   state in the network.  This concept is not explicitly defined in
   [RFC8231], but is fully compatible with it.  We use the LSP-DB to
   describe how certain actions are performed, because it is easier to
   define actions as a function of database state, rather than as a
   function of previously received messages.  The structure and format
   of the LSP-DB MUST be common among all dataplane types (i.e., RSVP-
   TE/SR-TE/SRv6), all instantiation methods (i.e., PCC-initiated/PCE-
   initiated), all destination types (i.e., point-to-point/point-to-
   multipoint).

   Note that we use the term "Tunnel" somewhat loosely here, to mean
   "the object identified by the PLSP-ID".  It may or may not be an
   actual tunnel in the implementation.  For example, working and
   protect paths can be implemented as one tunnel interface, but in PCEP
   we would refer to them as two different Tunnels, because they would
   have different PLSP-IDs.

   Note that the term "LSP", which stands for "Label Switched Path", if
   taken too literally would restrict our discussion to MPLS dataplane
   only.  In this document, we allow the term "LSP" to refer to any
   path, regardless of the dataplane format.  So that an LSP can refer
   to MPLS and SRv6 dataplane paths.

3.1.  Structure

   [RFC8231] states that the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV contains the key that
   MUST be used to differentiate different LSPs during make before break
   procedure.  We further clarify here that PCEP LSPs exist in a 2-tier
   structure.  The top tier is the "Tunnel", identified by the PLSP-ID
   and/or SYMBOLIC-NAME, while the lower tier is the "LSP", identified
   by the values in LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV.  A single Tunnel may contain
   multiple LSPs at the same time, i.e., a Tunnel is a container for
   LSPs.  A Tunnel MUST have at least one LSP and when the last LSP is
   removed from the Tunnel, the Tunnel itself is removed.

3.2.  Synchronization

   The stateful PCE MUST maintain the PCE LSP-DB, which stores Tunnels
   and LSPs.  The PCE LSP DB is only modified by PCRpt messages.  No
   other PCEP message may modify the PCE LSP DB.  The PCC MUST also
   maintain the PCC LSP DB, which it MUST synchronize with the PCE LSP
   DB by sending PCRpt messages.

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION              February 2022


   The PCC adds/removes entries to/from its LSP-DB based on what LSPs it
   creates/destroys in the network.  There can be many trigger types for
   updating the PCC LSP-DB, some examples include PCUpd messages, local
   computation on the PCC, local configuration on the PCC, etc.  The
   trigger type does not affect the content of the PCC LSP-DB, i.e., the
   content of the PCC LSP-DB is updated identically regardless of the
   trigger type.

   Whenever a PCC modifies an entry in its PCC LSP-DB, it MUST send a
   PCRpt message to the PCE (or multiple PCEs), to synchronize this
   change.  Ensuring this synchronization is always in place allows one
   to define behavior as a function of LSP-DB state, instead of defining
   behavior as a function of what PCEP messages were sent or received.

   The PCE MUST always act on the latest state of the PCE LSP DB.  Note
   that this does not mean that the PCE cannot use information from
   outside of LSP-DB.  For example, the PCE can use other mechanisms to
   collect traffic statistics and use them in the computation.  However,
   these traffic statistics are not part of the LSP-DB, but only
   reference it.

   The LSP-DB on both the PCC and the PCE only stores the actual state
   in the network, it does not store the desired state.  For example,
   consider the case of PCE Initiated LSP, configured on the PCE.  When
   the operator modifies the configuration of this LSP, that is a change
   in desired state.  The actual state has not yet changed, so LSP-DB is
   not modified yet.  The LSP-DB is only modified after the PCE sends
   PCInit/PCUpd message to the PCC and the PCC decides to act on that
   message.  When the PCC acts on message, it would update its own PCC
   LSP DB and immediately send PCRpt to the PCE to synchronize the
   change.  When the PCE receives the PCRpt msg, it updates its own PCE
   LSP DB.  After this, the PCC LSP DB and PCE LSP DB are in sync.

3.3.  Stateful Bringup

   [RFC8231] in section 5.8.2, allows delegation of an LSP in
   operationally down state, but at the same time mandates the use of
   PCReq, before sending PCRpt.  In this document, we would like to make
   it clear that sending PCReq is optional.

   We shall refer to the process of sending PCReq before PCRpt as
   "stateless bringup".  In reality, stateless bringup introduces
   overhead and is not possible to enforce from the PCE, because the
   stateless PCE is not supposed to keep any per-LSP state about
   previous PCReq messages.  It was found that many vendors choose to
   ignore this requirement and send the PCRpt directly, without going
   through PCReq.  This section will serve to explain and to validate
   this behavior.

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION              February 2022


   Even though all the major vendors today are moving to the stateful
   PCE model, it does not deprecate the need for stateless PCEP.  The
   key property of stateless PCEP is that PCReq messages MUST NOT modify
   the state of the PCE LSP-DB in any way.  Therefore, PCReq messages
   are useful for many OAM ping/traceroute applications where the PCC
   wishes to probe the network without having any effect on the existing
   LSPs.

   The PCC MAY delegate an empty LSP to the PCE and then wait for the
   PCE to send PCUpd, without sending PCReq.  We shall refer to this
   process as "stateful bringup".  The PCE MUST support the original
   stateless bringup, for backward compatibility purposes.  Supporting
   stateful bringup should not require introducing any new behavior on
   the PCE, because as mentioned earlier, the PCE MUST NOT modify LSP-DB
   state based on PCReq messages.  So whether the PCE has received a
   PCReq or not, it MUST process the PCRpt all the same.

   An example of stateful bringup follows.  In our example the PCC
   starts off by using LSP-ID of 0.  The value 0 does not hold any
   special meaning, any other 16-bit value could have been used.

   PCC has no LSP yet, but wants to establish a path.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-FLAG=DOWN, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0,
   ERO={}).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |

     | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=0, D-flag=1, OPER=DOWN, ERO={}       |

                        Figure 1: Content of LSP DB

   PCC received a PCUpd from the PCE and has decided to install the
   ERO={A} from that PCUpd.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-
   FLAG=UP, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0, ERO={A}).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

3.4.  Successful MBB

   Below we give an example of doing MBB to switch the Tunnel from one
   path to another.  We represent the path encoded into the ERO object
   as ERO={A} and ERO={B}.

   PCC has an existing LSP in UP state, with LSP-ID=2.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER-FLAG=UP).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
     +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
     | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER=UP                  |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                        Figure 3: Content of LSP DB

   PCC initiates the MBB procedure by creating a new LSP with LSP-ID=3.
   It does not matter what triggered the creation of the new LSP, it
   could have been due to a new path received via PCUpd (if the given
   Tunnel is delegated), or it could have been local computation on the
   PCC (if the Tunnel is locally computed on the PCC), or it could have
   been a change in configuration on the PCC (if the Tunnel's path is
   explicitly configured on the PCC).  It is important to emphasize that
   the procedure for updating the LSP-DB is common, regardless of the
   trigger that caused the change.

   PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER-
   FLAG=UP).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
     +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
     | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER=UP                  |
     |                 | LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER=UP                  |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                        Figure 4: Content of LSP DB

   After traffic has successfully switched to the new LSP, the PCC
   cleans up the old LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=1, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-
   ID=2).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
     +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
     | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER=UP                  |

3.5.  Aborted MBB

   The MBB process can abort when the newly created LSP is destroyed
   before it is installed as traffic carrying.  This scenario is
   described below.

   PCC has an existing LSP in UP state, with LSP-ID=2.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, OPER-FLAG=UP, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
     +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
     | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, OPER=UP                           |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                        Figure 6: Content of LSP DB

   MBB procedure is initiated, a new LSP is created with LSP-ID=3.  LSP
   is currently being established, so its oper state is DOWN.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, OPER-FLAG=DOWN, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=3).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |

4.  PCEP Association Database

   PCEP Association is a group of zero or more LSPs.

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION              February 2022


   The PCE ASSO DB is populated by PCRpt messages and MAY also be
   populated via configuration on the PCE itself.  An Association is
   identified by the Association Parameters.  The Association parameters
   contain many fields, so for convenience we will group all the fields
   into a single value.  We will use ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_PARAM=B, to
   refer to different PCEP Associations: A and B, respectively.

4.1.  2 LSPs in same Association

   Below, we give an example of LSPs joining the same Association.

   PCC creates the first LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100,
   LSP-ID=1, ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_R_FLAG=0).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   PCC updates the first LSP, the PCC is NOT REQUIRED to send the
   ASSOCIATION object in this PCRpt, since the LSP is already in the
   Association.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1).  The
   content of the PCE ASSO DB is unchanged.  Note that the PCC MUST send
   the ASSOCIATION OBJECT in the first PCRpt during SYNC state, even if
   it has already issued a PCRpt with the association object sometime in
   the past with this PCE.  The synchronization steps outlined in
   [RFC8697] are to be followed.

4.2.  Switch Association during MBB

   Each new LSP (identified by the LSP-ID) does not inherit the
   Association membership of any previous LSPs within the same Tunnel.
   This is done so that a Tunnel can have two LSPs that are in different
   Associations, this may be required when switching from one
   Association to another.

   Below, we give an example a Tunnel going through MBB and switching
   from Association A to Association B.

   PCC creates the first LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100,
   LSP-ID=1, ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_R_FLAG=0).

5.  Computation Constraints

   For any PCEP object that does not have an explicit removal flag, the
   absence of that object indicates removal of the constraint specified
   by that object.  For example, suppose the first state-report contains
   an LSPA object with some affinity constraints.  Then if a subsequent
   state-report does not contain an LSPA object, then this means that
   the previously specified affinity constraints do not apply anymore.
   Same applies to all PCEP objects, like METRIC, BANDWIDTH, etc., which
   do not have an explicit flag for removal.  This simply ensures that
   it is possible to remove a constraint without using an explicit
   removal flag.

6.  Use of RRO, SR-RRO and SRv6-RRO objects

   [RFC8231] defines a PCRpt message which contains <intended-path>
   known as the ERO object and <actual-path> known as the RRO object.
   [RFC8664] defines SR-ERO and SR-RRO objects for SR-TE LSPs.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] further defines SRv6-ERO and
   SRv6-RRO objects for SRv6-TE paths.

   In practice RRO data set is the result of signalling of the intended
   path defined in the ERO via protocol such as RSVP.  The ERO and RRO
   values may be different as the path encoded in the ERO may differ
   than the RRO such as during protection conditions or if the ERO
   contains loose hops which are expanded upon.  As Segment Routing LSP
   does not perform any signalling, the values of an SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO and
   SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO (respectively) are in practice the same, therefore
   some implementations have omitted the SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO when reporting
   a SR-TE LSP while others continue to send both SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO and
   SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO values.

   A PCC MUST send an (possibly empty) ERO/SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO in the PCRpt
   message for every LSP.  A PCC MAY send an SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO for an SR-
   TE/SRv6-TE LSP (respectively).  A PCE SHOULD interpret the RRO/SR-
   RRO/SRv6-RRO as the actual path the LSP is taking but MAY interpret
   only the ERO/SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO as the actual path.  In the absence of
   an RRO/SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO a PCE SHOULD interpret the ERO/SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO
   (respectively) as the actual path for the LSP.
