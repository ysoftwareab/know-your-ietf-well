               Transport parameters for 0-RTT connections
                      draft-kuhn-quic-0rtt-bdp-03

Abstract

   The time-to-service duration depends on both peers and the peer
   initiating the connection may not be the peer actually sending data.
   Moreover, clients may be resource-limited, behind a low bandwidth or
   a long-RTT network and may need adaptations to improve data
   transmission or reception.  While each client and server can have its
   dedicated solution to store path parameters, having a standard way of
   exchanging this information helps in providing symmetrical control of
   the optimisation and reducing protocol ossification.  QUIC may not be
   limited to HTTP3: it can be used as a substrate for proxying and
   tunneling.

   This memo discusses a solution where the client is informed about
   path parameters: both the client and the server can contribute to the
   reduction of the time-to-service for subsequent connections.  This
   would improve symmetrical transmission of data and reduce
   ossification of the protocol.  To improve the time-to-service of
   subsequent 0-RTT reconnection the server currently sets in the
   early_data extension the maximum volume of egress data the client is
   allowed to send when reconnecting.  This memo proposes BDP_metadata,
   an additional extension, to also inform the client about path
   parameters.

1.  Introduction

   Some network paths result in an increased time-to-service because the
   default parameters controlling the initialization of the transport
   and congestion control are not suitable for the path characteristics.
   QUIC's congestion control is based on TCP NewReno
   [I-D.ietf-quic-recovery] and the recommended initial window is
   defined by [RFC6928].  A path with a large bandwidth delay product



Kuhn, et al.             Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 2]

   can therefore significantly increase the time-to-service (e.g. a path
   using satellite communication [IJSCN19] could observe a much longer
   page load time for complex pages).  The 0-RTT mechanism is designed
   to accelerate the throughput when reconnecting to the same peer.
   There are cases where egress acceleration like 0-RTT early_data alone
   does not improve the time-to-service and cases where the data
   transmission is symmetrical or where clients are capacity-limited:
   additional information can be beneficial.

   This memo describes a solution where a BDP_metadata extension informs
   the client about path parameters so that both the client and the
   server can contribute to the reduction of the time-to-service:

   1.  the server learns characteristics of the path during a
       connection.  In most of the cases this will occur during the
       first (1-RTT) connection;

   2.  the server sends this information to the client at any time
       during this connection after the BDP_metadata parameters are
       validated;

   3.  the client may discard the ticket for reasons like validation
       period too short, not consistent with its own path
       characteristics measure, device with limited buffer, etc.;

   4.  the server and the client exploit the information to improve the
       time-to-service during subsequent 0-RTT connections.

   The proposed solution applies to TLS1.3 over any transport: even if
   the current focus is QUIC, the solution applies, e.g., for TCP Fast
   Open.

1.1.  Reducing ossification with the proposed solution

   While each client and server can have their dedicated solution to
   store path parameters, having a standard way of exchanging this
   information helps in providing symmetrical control of the
   optimisation and reducing protocol ossification.  This memo discusses
   a solution where the client is informed about path parameters: both
   the client and the server can contribute to the reduction of the
   time-to-service for subsequent connections.  This would improve
   symmetrical transmission of data and reduce ossification of the
   protocol.  Some advantages of the proposed solution are the
   following.

   1.  Provide symmetrical control of the optimisation: as extensions to
       HTTP3 envision server initiated request [I-D.ietf-quic-http] the
       path adaptation should be symmetrical and should not depend on



Kuhn, et al.             Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT                 July 2019


       rule of the peer in the establishment.  Moreover, QUIC may not be
       used for the sole use of HTTP3 services but is also considered as
       a relevant candidate for setting up proxies or tunnels
       [I-D.kuehlewind-quic-substrate].  The client device should be
       able to adapt to the path adaptation chosen by the server.  Since
       there are more and more exchange based on subscription where the
       server sends data first, with regard to ossification, it is
       central to dissociate the signalling (aka the initiator of the
       connection) from the peer which first sends application data.

   2.  Reduce TCP-proxy and middleboxes: if both clients and servers
       have the required parameters to optimize the transmissions for
       different deployment scenarios, end-to-end optimization may be
       proposed.  As example, specific client-based adaptations can be
       developed, such as adapting the ACK-ratio or increasing the
       receive buffer size.  Thus, deploying middleboxes that ossify the
       Internet would be less relevant.

   3.  Improve inter-operability: while each client and server can have
       their dedicated solution to store path parameters, having a
       standard way of exchanging this information helps in reducing the
       time-to-service when clients and servers are not provided by the
       same company.  Both sides can independently propose optimizations
       to improve the ingress traffic.

2.  Differences between 1-RTT and 0-RTT QUIC connections establishment

   This section recalls how 1-RTT and 0-RTT operate in QUIC
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   QUIC leverages the 2 handshakes of TLS1.3 [I-D.ietf-quic-tls]: The
   1-RTT handshake initiates a first set of credentials.  When a
   handshake achieves successfully, the server pushes the learned
   information about the session to the client in an opaque session
   ticket (see section 4.6.1 of [RFC8446]).  The information within the
   opaque ticket is encrypted by the server and not readable by the
   client.  A session ticket can be sent at any time during the
   connection.  The server can send several session tickets in one
   connection.  A client willing to establish a fast re-opening of the
   session pushes back an opaque ticket in a 0-RTT handshake and sends
   early application data.

   In practice, the server sends the 'ticket' in a NewSessionTicket
   record [I-D.ietf-quic-tls].  The structure of the NewSessionTicket
   includes the opaque 'ticket' and an 'extensions' field.  The
   NewSessionTicket carries an additional field named 'early_data' that
   indicates to the client the maximum size of application data to
   insert in the 0-RTT message.

3.  End-to-end solution

   QUIC encryption of transport headers prevents the adding of
   Performance-enhancing proxy (PEP).  The BDP metadata extension may be
   a substitute to PEP proxy [RFC2488], [RFC3135] when time-to-service
   improvement requires acceleration of the refilling of client
   application buffers.

   The BDP_metadata extension proposes an improvement of the
   initialization of 0-RTT connections where the client recalls the BDP
   metadata previously measured by the server during the 1-RTT
   handshake.  The approach follows the tuning of the initial window of
   high BDP networks described in
   [I-D.irtf-iccrg-sallantin-initial-spreading].  It has been shown to
   improve performance both for high BDP and more common BDP
   [CONEXT15][ICC16].

3.1.  Description of the BDP metadata extension

   This document defines an extension named "BDP_metadata" for the
   NewSessionTicket.  This structure contains the following parameters:
   BDP, MTU, RTT, loss-rate.

3.2.  Usage of the extension in the NewSessionTicket

   At the end of a 1-RTT connection, a server can send information in a
   NewSessionTicket that describes the path to the client.  The message
   includes an additional 'extensions' field named 'BDP_metadata'.  The
   client stores this session ticket and the 'BDP_metadata' field.

   When the client reconnects to the same server in 0-RTT mode, it
   pushes back this session ticket in the ClientHello and prepares
   itself to receive data in the context given by the 'BDP_metadata'
   field.  The client does not send the 'BDP_metadata' field back to the
   server.  The server receives the session ticket and extracts the BDP
   context.  As example, it can use this message to provide information
   that may allow the congestion controller to provide a throughput
   closer to the capacity of the path.

   Because the path characteristics can change over time, and may hence
   become invalid for use in a subsequent connection, the server sets
   the age of the ticket (see section 4.2.11.1 of [RFC8446]) to a short
   duration.  A server could also update the ticket when the path
   characteristics of connection are known to have changed.

4.  Best current practice

   This section provides examples of data that could be added in the
   opaque ticket field by the server.  The details added by the server
   in the session ticket do not need to be standardized for
   interoperability between QUIC clients and servers because this
   information is opaque to the client.  The presence of the
   "BDP_metadata" extension field in the NewSessionTicket informs the
   client that the server can actively take action to improve its
   throughput when the session will restart.

   The following list describes information elements set by the server
   in the session ticket to accompany the signaling of field.  These
   examples are illustrated in Figure 1 and their purpose is detailed in
   this section.

   o  A client aware of a high BDP path: Section 7.3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] indicates that the "A client that
      attempts to send 0-RTT data MUST remember the transport parameters
      used by the server".  In addition to the default transport
      parameters used by the server, a server that knows that the path
      has a large BDP can let the client adapt its parameters.

   o  PMTU: Knowledge of the PMTU of a previous path improves the time
      to service because it reduces the duration of the path validation
      process described in section 8.2 of [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   o  Connection RTT: The knowledge of the characteristics of a previous
      connection RTT can improve the throughput because a server can
      safely improve the slow start: e.g. using the pacing models of
      [I-D.irtf-iccrg-sallantin-initial-spreading] can result in high IW
      for high RTT paths and a common IW for paths with smaller RTT.
      The results presented in [ICC16] show that for both files of 15 KB
      and 750 KB, the proposed solution reduces the time to download by
      approximatively 2 seconds whether the RTT is 50ms or 500ms.

   o  Ticket_lifetime: The server sets a shorter validity duration to
      avoid receiving obsolete path characteristics; (e.g., this could
      reduce the validity to one day).

5.  What happens when BDP is used incorrectly?

   This section discusses the impact of a server activating the
   'BDP_metadata' field when the network underneath actually has a small
   BDP.  This could happen when the server BDP estimate was incorrect,
   when the client has multiple paths to choose from and uses the ticket
   on a different path to which it was requested, or when the path
   characteristics change significantly.

   Incorrectly exploiting the BDP_metadata could result in assigning
   additional resources (e.g. buffer space) that later is not used.

   Apart from cases where the clients are resource-limited, this is not
   much of an issue.

   The server could adapt the initial window to a high BDP context when
   the BDP is actually small.  This issue can be prevented if packets
   are paced out of the server.

6.  Discussion

   This mechanism follows the approach of the extension field
   'early_data' of the NewSessionTicket of TLS1.3.  While 'early_data'
   improves the egress traffic of a client, the 'BDP_metadata' proposal
   aims at improving ingress traffic to the client.  Improving the
   ingress traffic can result in significant improvement to the quality-
   of-experience.  For example, this enables the use of transport
   parameters, such as the RTT, PMTU and BDP to adapt the initial data
   transmission of a 0-RTT connection.  In some large BDP deployment
   scenarios, this can halve the page load time of a web page download.

7.  Acknowledgements

   None.

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: text is required to register the extension BDP_metadata field.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security is provided by the 1-RTT phase.  The measure of BDP is
   made during a previous connection.  The exchange and the information
   are protected both by the TLS encryption and the NewSessionTicket
   (see section 4.6.1 of [RFC8446]).

   The BDP information the server will received is protected in the
   opaque session ticket.  The 'BDP_metadata' field is visible by the
   client only.  An client that does not trust the server transport
   adaptation ignores any session ticket associated to a 'BDP_metadata'
   field.

   The server does not have to honour all the received requests (e.g.
   when it is resource-limited).
