  IMAP4 Extension for Returning MYRIGHTS Information in Extended LIST
                 draft-ietf-extra-imap-list-myrights-07

   Protocol (IMAP) LIST command that allows the client to request the
   set of rights that the logged-in user has been granted on mailboxes,
   along with other information typically returned by the LIST command.

1.  Introduction

   IMAP [RFC3501] clients typically fetch the set of rights granted on
   mailboxes so they can expose the allowed functionality to the logged-
   in user.  In order to do that, the client is forced to issue a LIST
   or LSUB command to list all available mailboxes, followed by a
   MYRIGHTS command for each mailbox found.  This document defines an
   extension to the to IMAP LIST command that is identified by the
   capability string "LIST-MYRIGHTS".  The LIST-MYRIGHTS extension
   allows the client to request the set of rights that the logged-in
   user has been granted on mailboxes, along with other information
   typically returned by the LIST command.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [1] [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft             IMAP LIST-MYRIGHTS                  June 2018


3.  MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command

   [RFC4314] defines the MYRIGHTS command which is used by an IMAP
   client to determine the set of rights that the logged-in user has
   been granted on a given mailbox.  Frequently, a client will have to
   look up the rights for some or all of the mailboxes returned by the
   LIST command.  Doing so in multiple MYRIGHTS commands wastes
   bandwidth and can degrade performance if the client does not pipeline
   the requests.

   This document extends the LIST command with a new "MYRIGHTS" return
   option [RFC5258], which allows the client to request all of the
   desired information in a single command.  For each listable mailbox
   matching the list pattern and selection options, the server MUST
   return an untagged LIST response and SHOULD also return an untagged
   MYRIGHTS response containing the set of rights granted to the logged-
   in user.  The ordering of the responses is significant only in that
   the server MUST NOT send a MYRIGHTS response for a given mailbox
   before it sends the LIST response for that mailbox.

   If the server is unable to look up the set of rights for a given
   mailbox, it does not send the MYRIGHTS reply for that mailbox.

   Client authors ought to note that generating the MYRIGHTS responses
   for a large number of mailboxes may be an expensive operation for the
   server.  Clients SHOULD use a suitable match pattern and/or selection
   option to limit the set of mailboxes returned to only those whose
   rights in which they are interested.

4.  Examples

   In this example the "bar" mailbox doesn't exist, so it has no
   MYRIGHTS reply.

   C: A01 LIST "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
   S: * LIST () "." "INBOX"
   S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda
   S: * LIST () "." "foo"
   S: * MYRIGHTS "foo" lrs
   S: * LIST (\NonExistent) "." "bar"
   S: A01 OK List completed.

   In this example the LIST reply for the "foo" mailbox is returned
   because it has matching children, but no MYRIGHTS reply is returned
   because "foo" itself doesn't match the selection criteria.

   C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED RECURSIVEMATCH) "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
   S: * LIST (\Subscribed) "." "INBOX"
   S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda
   S: * LIST () "." "foo" (CHILDINFO ("SUBSCRIBED"))
   S: A02 OK List completed.

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].  Terms not defined here are
   taken from [RFC5258].

   return-option =/ "MYRIGHTS"

6.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations described in [RFC4314],
   this extension makes it a bit easier for clients to overload the
   server by requesting MYRIGHTS information for a large number of
   mailboxes.  However, as already noted in the introduction, existing
   clients already try to do that by generating a large number of
   MYRIGHTS commands for each mailbox in which they are interested.
   While performing MYRIGHTS information retrieval for big lists of
   mailboxes, a server implementation needs to make sure that it can
   still serve other IMAP connections and yield execution to other
   connections, when necessary.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any additional privacy concerns
   beyond those described in [RFC4314].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of IMAP capability LIST-MYRIGHTS

   This document defines the "LIST-MYRIGHTS" IMAP capability to be added
   to the "IMAP Capabilities" registry:
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-capabilities/imap-
   capabilities.xhtml#imap-capabilities-1>.

8.2.  Registration of LIST-EXTENDED option MYRIGHTS

   This section registers the "MYRIGHTS" option to be added to the
   "LIST-EXTENDED options" registry: <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   imap-list-extended/imap-list-extended.xhtml#imap-list-extended-1>.

   LIST-EXTENDED option name:  MYRIGHTS

   LIST-EXTENDED option type:  RETURN

   LIST-EXTENDED option description:  Causes the LIST command to return
      MYRIGHTS responses in addition to LIST responses.

   Published specification:  RFC XXXX, Section 3

   Security considerations:  RFC XXXX, Section 6
