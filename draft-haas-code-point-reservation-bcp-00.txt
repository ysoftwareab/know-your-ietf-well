                Registries and for Bit Field Registries
                draft-haas-code-point-reservation-bcp-00

Abstract

   This document describes common code point reservation strategies for
   the zeroth and last code points in IANA-managed IETF registries and
   for bit-field registries.  The document additionally provides the
   reasoning to support these strategies and their adoption as Best
   Current Practices to be applied to all IETF registries.

1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   A fundamental component of networking protocols are the fields
   contained within their Protocol Data Units (PDUs), a.k.a. packets.
   The fields are typically enumerated and are often part of the common
   syntactic form of a Type, Length, Value (TLV) tuple.  An allocation
   of one of these enumerated fields is a code point.

   When designing or extending a networking protocol, some thought must
   be put into the range of allowable values and format for these
   fields.  Additionally consideration must be given to how the
   allocation of the code points for these fields is managed.  Other
   documents, for example [I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis], are dedicated
   to strategies for the management of such code point registries.

   The range of allowable values must be large enough to accommodate not
   only immediate uses that are part of the design of a protocol or
   protocol extension, but must also provide room for future
   maintenance.  Some protocols that are meant to be used in highly
   constrained environments may also attempt to minimize the size of
   packets to conserve networking resources.  Thus, a balance between
   being small enough to conserve resources but large enough to permit
   future expansion provides a tension that protocol designers must
   navigate.

Internet-Draft Reservation Strategies for IETF Code PointsSeptember 2015


   One further matter for consideration for such code point registries
   is pre-reserving some values.  This document discusses a reasoning
   for the reservation of the zeroth and last code point in an integer
   field, and a general policy for the reservation of unused bits in
   bit-vectors.

3.  A Reservation Strategy for the Zeroth and Last Code-Points

   When designing a protocol, a design decision must be made for integer
   code-points as to how large to make its range.  Some protocols may
   prize density and thus elect for a small range, often a byte and
   perhaps less.  Other protocols may be dominated by a need for
   flexibility and expansion and use a large range, four bytes or
   larger.

   When creating new integer code-point registries, this document makes
   the following recommendation:

   o  The zeroth entry of the new registry SHOULD be reserved.  This
      permits implementors to avoid the need of separate boolean state
      to represent that a code point has been set with the value zero.
      It is RECOMMENDED that the reservation text should be of the form,
      "Reserved (not to be allocated)".

   o  The last entry of the new registry SHOULD be reserved.  This
      provides future maintainers of the protocol the ability to extend
      the functionality covered by the semantics of this code point when
      all other numbers may have otherwise been allocated.  (See
      [I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis], Section 6, "Reserved".)  It is
      RECOMMENDED that the reservation text should be of the form,
      "Reserved (for future use for registry extension)".

   Implementations MAY specify that the zeroth code point is explicitly
   prohibited in the protocol.  Experience in implementation, however,
   has suggested that fatal error conditions based on this behavior lend
   itself to a brittleness in the protocol with unforseen future
   consequences.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT explicitly treat the use of the last code
   point as an error condition outside the semantics otherwise specified
   within the protocol for an unused code-point.  Making this value
   explicitly forbidden within the protocol eliminates its usefulness
   for future expansion in the presence of older implementations that do
   not understand the expanded semantic.  In other words, future proof
   your implementation.

   An example of such an allocation for a registry:

   Value | Meaning
   ------+--------------------------------------------------
     0   | Reserved (not to be allocated)
     :   |
    Max  | Reserved (for future use for registry extension)

4.  Reservation Strategies for Bit Fields

   When code points representing bit-fields in protocols are made, many
   of the new bits are generally unallocated and left for future
   expansion.  These bit-fields are either noted as Reserved or have
   other similar policies associated with them in the registry
   containing them.

   Specifications containing such reserved fields are recommended to
   provide text documenting these reserved fields similar to the
   following: "These fields are Reserved and MUST be set to zero upon
   transmission and SHOULD be ignored upon receipt."

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any requests to IANA.  However, future
   documents may wish to utilize this document as an informative
   reference for their reservation strategy when making requests to
   IANA.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments

   This document was originally a lunch discussion with John Scudder
   about IETF code point allocations for BGP.  While the above practices
   were thought to be widely understood, they did not appear to be
   written down anywhere to help educate new IETF participants.

   This document has also benefited from excellent discussion of the
   subject on the IETF Working Group Chairs e-mail list.
