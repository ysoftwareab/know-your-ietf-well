0. Abstract

   This document discusses the need for delegation of the IP6.ARPA DNS
   zone, and specifies a plan for the technical operation thereof.

1. Why IP6.ARPA?

   In the IPv6 address space, there is a need for 'reverse mapping' of
   addresses to DNS names analogous to that provided by the IN-ADDR.ARPA
   zone for IPv4.

   The IAB recommended that the ARPA top level domain (the name is now
   considered an acronym for "Address and Routing Parameters Area") be
   used for technical infrastructure sub-domains when possible.  It is
   already in use for IPv4 reverse mapping and has been established as
   the location for E.164 numbering on the Internet [RFC2916 RFC3026].

   IETF consensus was reached that the IP6.ARPA domain be used for
   address to DNS name mapping for the IPv6 address space [RFC2874].

2. Osoleted Usage

   This document deprecates references to IP6.INT in [RFC2553] section
   6.2.3, [RFC2766] section 4.1, [RFC2772] section 7.1.c, and [RFC2874]
   section 2.5.

3. IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that the IANA delegate the IP6.ARPA domain
   following instructions to be provided by the IAB.  Names within this
   zone are to be further delegated to the regional IP registries in
   accordance with the delegation of IPv6 address space to those
   registries.  The names allocated should be hierarchic in accordance
   with the address space assignment.

4. Security Considerations

   While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping has been exploited in
   IPv4, delegation of the IP6.ARPA zone creates no new threats to the
   security of the internet.
