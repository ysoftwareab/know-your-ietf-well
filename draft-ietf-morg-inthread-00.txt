Abstract

    The SEARCH=INTHREAD extension extends the IMAP SEARCH command to
    operate on threads as well as individual messages. Other commands
    which search are implicitly extended.

    The THREAD=REFS extension provides a threading algorithm using
    (almost) only the References header field for use with the IMAP
    THREAD command.


1.  Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

    Formal syntax is defined by [RFC5234].

    Example lines prefaced by "C:" are sent by the client and ones
    prefaced by "S:" by the server. The five characters [...] means that
    something has been elided.


2.  Overview

    This document defines two related extensions.

    The THREAD=REFS extension defined a fairly pure References-based
    (see [RFC5322] section 3.6.4) threading algorithm for use with the
    THREAD command (see [RFC5256]) and with SEARCH=INTHREAD.

    An IMAP server (see [RFC3501]) that supports the THREAD=REFS
    extension MUST announce THREAD=REFS as capabilities. This extension
    adds no new commands and responses, only a new thread algorithm.

    The SEARCH=INTHREAD extension extends the IMAP SEARCH command to
    operate on threads as well as individual messages. Other commands
    which search are implicitly extended. SEARCH=INTHREAD requires that
    servers implement THREAD=REFS too.

    An IMAP server that supports SEARCH=INTHREAD MUST announce both
    SEARCH=INTHREAD and THREAD=REFS as capabilities. This extension adds
    no new commands and responses, but adds four new search-keys,
    INTHREAD, THREADROOT, THREADLEAF and MESSAGEID, and one search
    return option, THREAD=REFS.

3.  New Search Keys

    This document defines three new search keys which operate on
    threads: One to find all messages in a thread where at least one
    message matches another search key, one to find the roots of threads
    and one to find the leaves. It also defines a helper which matches a
    message given its message-id.


3.1. The INTHREAD Search Key

    INTHREAD takes one argument, which is another search key.

    The INTHREAD search-key matches a message if its subsidiary search-
    key matches at least one message in the same thread as the message.

    This command finds all messages in an entire thread concerning the
    meetings where fizzle was discussed:

         C: a UID SEARCH INTHREAD (SUBJECT meeting BODY fizzle)

    This command threads all threads containing at least one message
    from fred@example.com:

         C: a UID THREAD REFS utf-8 INTHREAD FROM <fred@example.com>


3.2. The THREADROOT Search Key

    The THREADROOT search key matches a message if that message does not
    have any extant parent according to the active threading algorithm
    (see section 3.5).

    This command finds the roots of all threads containing unread
    messages:

         C: a UID SEARCH THREADROOT INTHREAD UNSEEN


3.3. The THREADLEAF Search Key

    The THREADLEAF search key matches a message if that message has no
    extant children in the same mailbox, according to the active
    threading algorithm.

    Note that THEADLEAF interacts badly with THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT.
    THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT is defined such that every message is either a
    root or a leaf, there are no intermediate nodes.

Internet-draft                                              January 2009


    This command finds all messages that were (also) sent to me, and to
    which noone has answered:

         C: a UID SEARCH THREADLEAF OR TO <me@example.com> CC
            <me@example.com>


3.4. The MESSAGEID Search Key

    The MESSAGEID search key takes a sigle argument, and matches a
    message if that message's normalized nessage-id is the same as the
    argument.

    This command finds all in the same thread as
    <4321.1234321@example.com>:

         C: a UID SEARCH INTHREAD MESSAGEID <4321.1234321@example.com>


3.5. The THREAD=* Search Return Option(s)

    The THREAD=* search return options enables the client to select
    which threading algorithm the server uses when processing INTHREAD,
    THREADROOT and THREADLEAF as part of a SEARCH command. If THREAD=*
    isn't specified, then the default for the SEARCH command is
    THREAD=REFS.

    When the server processes a THREAD command, it uses the algorithm
    specified by the client.

    This command sorts the messages by subject and returns the first
    message with each subject, disregarding "fwd", "re" and other
    paraphernalia:

         C: a UID SEARCH RETURN (THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT) THREADROOT


4.  The THREAD=REFS Thread Algorithm

    The THREAD=REFS thread algorithm is defined as the part of
    THREAD=REFERENCES (see [RFC5256]) which concerns itself with the
    References, In-Reply-To and Message-ID fields.  THREAD=REFS ignores
    Subject.

    THREAD=REFS sorts threads by the most recent INTERNALDATE in each
    thread, replacing THREAD=REFERENCES step (4). This means that when a
    new message arrives, its thread becomes the latest thread. (Note
    that while threads are sorted by arrival date, messages within a

    thread are sorted by sent date, just as for THREAD=REFERENCES.)

    This document defines THREAD=REFS because THREAD=REFERENCES is too
    inclusive for the INTHREAD search key. For example, independent
    threads that happen to have the same subject field (such as "Agenda
    for Friday's meeting", "Web site updated" or "Message delivery
    failed") are grouped into one thread by THREAD=REFERENCES.

    It is explicitly permitted for the server to persistently store
    threading information, even if this causes the server to return
    different information than it would otherwise. This can happen if
    the first messages in a thread are deleted, for example.


5.  Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234]. [RFC3501] defines
    the non-terminals "capability" and "search-key", [RFC4466] defines
    "search-return-opt", [RFC5256] defines "thread-alg", and [RFC5322]
    defines "id-left" and "id-right".

    Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
    insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
    token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
    accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

        capability   =/ "SEARCH=INTHREAD" / "THREAD=REFS"

        search-key   =/ "INTHREAD" SP search-key / "MESSAGEID" SP "<"
                        id-left "@" id-right ">" / "THREADROOT" /
                        "THREADLEAF"

        thread-alg   =/ "REFS"

        search-return-opt =/ "THREAD=" thread-alg


6.  Security Considerations

    This document is believed not to have any security implications.


7.  IANA Considerations

    The IANA is requested to add SEARCH=INTHREAD and THREAD=REFS to the
    list of IMAP extensions,
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities.

Open Issues

    None.


Changes since -00

    - The IANA asked me to specify the IANA registry exactly

    - Boilerplate updates - IETF Trust and so on.


Changes since -01

    - Added THREADROOT, THREADLEAF and MESSAGEID

    - Fixed the typo


Changes since -02

    - Specified thread algorithm per-command, generally using a search
      return option.

    - Defined THREADROOT and THREADLEAF robustly.

    - Required that the server implement THREAD=REFS if it implements
      SEARCH=INTHREAD.

    - Use In-Reply-To as THREAD=REFERENCES, since Timo prefers that and
      I don't mind.

    - Use Date as T=R does. Hm? Good idea?


Changes since -03

    - Boilerplate updates for 5377 and blah


Changes since -03

    - Sort threads by the most recent date in each thread, so that new
      messages arriving makes a thread new again.

Changes since d-g-i-i-04

    - Define "most recent thread" by arrival date, not sender date.
      Suits typical client use better. When reading a thread, you want
      to read messages as ordered by the senders, but the most recent
      thread should be the one which arrived in your mailbox most
      recently.

    - Rename to be a WG draft.
