                  The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option
                 draft-ietf-dnsop-edns-tcp-keepalive-03

Abstract

   DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over either
   UDP or TCP.  UDP transport involves keeping less state on a busy
   server, but can cause truncation and retries over TCP.  Additionally,
   UDP can be exploited for reflection attacks.  Using TCP would reduce
   retransmits and amplification.  However, clients commonly use TCP
   only for fallback and servers typically use idle timeouts on the
   order of seconds.

   This document defines an EDNS0 option ("edns-tcp-keepalive") that
   allows DNS servers to signal a variable idle timeout.  This
   signalling facilitates a better balance of UDP and TCP transport
   between individual clients and servers, reducing the impact of
   problems associated with UDP transport and allowing the state
   associated with TCP transport to be managed effectively with minimal
   impact on the DNS transaction time.

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


1.  Introduction

   DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over either
   UDP or TCP [RFC1035].  Historically, DNS clients used API's that only
   facilitated sending and receiving a single query over either UDP or
   TCP.  New APIs and deployment of DNSSEC validating resolvers on hosts
   that in the past were using stub resolving only is increasing the DNS
   client base that prefer using long lived TCP connections.  Long-lived
   TCP connections can result in lower request latency than the case
   where UDP transport is used and truncated responses are received,
   since clients that have fallen back to TCP transport in response to a
   truncated response typically only uses the TCP session for a single
   (request, response) pair, continuing with UDP transport for
   subsequent queries.  Clients wishing to use other stream-based
   transport protocols for DNS would also benefit from the set-up
   amortisation afforded by long lived connections.

   UDP transport is stateless, and hence presents a much lower resource
   burden on a busy DNS server than TCP.  An exchange of DNS messages
   over UDP can also be completed in a single round trip between
   communicating hosts, resulting in optimally-short transaction times.
   UDP transport is not without its risks, however.

   A single-datagram exchange over UDP between two hosts can be
   exploited to enable a reflection attack on a third party.  Response
   Rate Limiting [RRL] is designed to help mitigate such attacks against
   authoritative-only servers.  One feature of RRL is to let some amount
   of responses "slip" through the rate limiter.  These are returned
   with the TC (truncation) bit set, which causes legitimate clients to
   re-query using TCP transport.

   [RFC1035] specified a maximum DNS message size over UDP transport of
   512 bytes.  Deployment of DNSSEC [RFC4033] and other protocols
   subsequently increased the observed frequency at which responses
   exceed this limit.  EDNS0 [RFC6891] allows DNS messages larger than
   512 bytes to be exchanged over UDP, with a corresponding increased
   incidence of fragmentation.  Fragmentation is known to be problematic
   in general, and has also been implicated in increasing the risk of
   cache poisoning attacks [fragmentation-considered-poisonous].

   TCP transport is less susceptible to the risks of fragmentation and
   reflection attacks.  However, TCP transport as currently deployed has
   expensive overhead.

   The overhead of the three-way TCP handshake for a single DNS
   transaction is substantial, increasing the transaction time for a
   single (request, response) pair of DNS messages from 1 x RTT to 2 x
   RTT.  There is no such overhead for a session that is already



Wouters, et al.           Expires April 2, 2016                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


   established, however, and the overall impact of the TCP setup
   handshake when the resulting session is used to exchange N DNS
   message pairs over a single session, (1 + N)/N, approaches unity as N
   increases.

   With increased deployment of DNSSEC and new RRtypes containing
   application specific cryptographic material, there is an increase in
   the prevalence of truncated responses received over UDP with fallback
   to TCP.

   (It should perhaps be noted that the overhead for a DNS transaction
   over UDP truncated due to RRL is 3x RTT, higher than the overhead
   imposed on the same transaction initiated over TCP.)

   The use of TCP transport requires state to be retained on DNS
   servers.  If a server is to perform adequately with a significant
   query load received over TCP, it must manage its available resources
   to ensure that all established TCP sessions are well-used, and idle
   connections are closed after an appropriate amount of time.

   This document proposes a signalling mechanism between DNS clients and
   servers that provides a means to better balance the use of UDP and
   TCP transport (thereby helping to manage the impact of problems
   associated with UDP), whilst constraining the impact of TCP on
   response times and server resources to a manageable level.

   This mechanism will be of benefit both for stub-resolver and
   resolver-authoritative TCP connections.  In the latter case the
   persistent nature of the TCP connection can provide improved defence
   against attacks including DDoS.

   The reduced overhead of this extension adds up significantly when
   combined with other EDNS0 extensions, such as [CHAIN-QUERY] and
   [DNS-over-TLS].  For example, the combination of these EDNS0
   extensions make it possible for hosts on high-latency mobile networks
   to natively and efficiently perform DNSSEC validation and encrypt
   queries.

3.  The edns-tcp-keepalive Option

   This document specifies a new EDNS0 [RFC6891] option, edns-tcp-
   keepalive, which can be used by DNS clients and servers to signal a

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


   willingness to keep an idle TCP session open for a certain amount of
   time to conduct future DNS transactions.  This specification does not
   distinguish between different types of DNS client and server in the
   use of this option.













3.1.  Option Format

   The edns-tcp-keepalive option is encoded as follows:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   !         OPTION-CODE           !         OPTION-LENGTH         !
   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |           TIMEOUT             !
   +-------------------------------+

   where:

   OPTION-CODE:   the EDNS0 option code assigned to edns-tcp-keepalive,
      [TBD]

   OPTION-LENGTH:   the value 0 if the TIMEOUT is omitted, the value 2
      if it is present;

   TIMEOUT:   an idle timeout value for the TCP connection, specified in
      units of 100 milliseconds, encoded in network byte order.

3.2.  Use by DNS Clients

3.2.1.  Sending Queries

   DNS clients MUST NOT include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in queries
   sent using UDP transport.





Wouters, et al.           Expires April 2, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


   DNS clients MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in the first
   query sent to a server using TCP transport to signal their desire to
   keep the connection open when idle.

   Clients MUST specify an OPTION-LENGTH of 0 and omit the TIMEOUT
   value.

3.2.2.  Receiving Responses

   A DNS client that receives a response using UDP transport that
   includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option MUST ignore the option.

   A DNS client that receives a response using TCP transport that
   includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY keep the existing TCP
   session open when it is idle.  It SHOULD honour the timeout and
   initiate close of the connection before the timeout expires.

   A DNS client that receives a response that includes the edns-tcp-
   keepalive option with a TIMEOUT value of 0 should send no more
   queries on that connection and initiate closing the connection as
   soon as it has received all outstanding responses.

   A DNS client that sent a query containing the edns-keepalive-option
   but receives a response that does not contain the edns-keepalive-
   option should assume the server does not support keepalive and behave
   following the guidance in [DRAFT-5966bis].  This holds true even if a
   previous edns-keepalive-option exchange occurred on the existing TCP
   connection.

3.3.  Use by DNS Servers

3.3.1.  Receiving Queries

   A DNS server that receives a query using UDP transport that includes
   the edns-tcp-keepalive option MUST ignore the option.

   A DNS server that receives a query using TCP transport that includes
   the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY modify the local idle timeout
   associated with that TCP session if resources permit.

3.3.2.  Sending Responses

   A DNS server that receives a query sent using TCP transport that
   includes an OPT RR MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in the
   response to signal the expected idle timeout on a connection.
   Servers MUST specify the TIMEOUT value that is currently associated
   with the TCP session.  It is reasonable for this value to change
   according to local resource constraints or in consideration of



Wouters, et al.           Expires April 2, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


   intermediary behaviour (for example TCP middleboxes or NATs).  The
   DNS server SHOULD send a edns-tcp-keepalive option with a timeout of
   0 if it deems its local resources are too low to service more TCP
   keepalive sessions, or if it wants clients to close currently open
   connections.

3.4.  TCP Session Management

   Both DNS clients and servers are subject to resource constraints
   which will limit the extent to which TCP sessions can persist.
   Effective limits for the number of active sessions that can be
   maintained on individual clients and servers should be established,
   either as configuration options or by interrogation of process limits
   imposed by the operating system.  Servers that implement edns-tcp-
   keepalive should also engage in TCP connection management by
   recycling existing connections when appropriate, closing connections
   gracefully and managing request queues to enable fair use.

   In the event that there is greater demand for TCP sessions than can
   be accommodated, servers may reduce the TIMEOUT value signalled in
   successive DNS messages to minimise idle time on existing sessions.
   This also allows, for example, clients with other candidate servers
   to query to establish new TCP sessions with different servers in
   expectation that an existing session is likely to be closed, or to
   fall back to UDP.

   Based on TCP session resources servers may signal a TIMEOUT value of
   0 to request clients to close connections as soon as possible.  This
   is useful when server resources become very low or a denial-of-
   service attack is detected and further maximises the shifting of
   TIME_WAIT state to well-behaved clients.

   However it should be noted that RCF6891 states:

      Lack of presence of an OPT record in a request MUST be taken as an
      indication that the requestor does not implement any part of this
      specification and that the responder MUST NOT include an OPT
      record in its response.

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


   Since servers must be faithful to this specification even on a
   persistent TCP connection it means that (following the initial
   exchange of timeouts) a server may not be presented with the
   opportunity to signal a change in the idle timeout associated with a
   connection if the client does not send any further requests
   containing EDNS0 OPT RRs.  This limitation makes persistent
   connection handling via an initial idle timeout signal more
   attractive than a mechanism that establishes default persistence and
   then uses a connection close signal (in a similar manner to HTTP 1.1
   [RFC7320]).

   DNS clients and servers MAY close a TCP session at any time in order
   to manage local resource constraints.  The algorithm by which clients
   and servers rank active TCP sessions in order to determine which to
   close is not specified in this document.

3.5.  Non-Clean Paths

   Many paths between DNS clients and servers suffer from poor hygiene,
   limiting the free flow of DNS messages that include particular EDNS0
   options, or messages that exceed a particular size.  A fallback
   strategy similar to that described in [RFC6891] section 6.2.2 SHOULD
   be employed to avoid persistent interference due to non-clean paths.

3.6.  Anycast Considerations

   DNS servers of various types are commonly deployed using anycast
   [RFC4786].

   Changes in network topology between clients and anycast servers may
   cause disruption to TCP sessions making use of edns-tcp-keepalive
   more often than with TCP sessions that omit it, since the TCP
   sessions are expected to be longer-lived.  Anycast servers MAY make
   use of TCP multipath [RFC6824] to anchor the server side of the TCP
   connection to an unambiguously-unicast address in order to avoid
   disruption due to topology changes.

4.  Intermediary Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that DNS intermediaries which terminate TCP
   connections implement edns-tcp-keepalive.  An intermediary that does
   not implement edns-tcp-keepalive but sits between a client and server
   that both support edns-tcp-keepalive might close idle connections
   unnecessarily.

5.  Security Considerations

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


   The edns-tcp-keepalive option can potentially be abused to request
   large numbers of sessions in a quick burst.  When a Nameserver
   detects abusive behaviour, it SHOULD immediately close the TCP
   connection and free the resources used.

   Servers could choose to monitor client behaviour with respect to the
   edns-tcp-keepalive option to build up profiles of clients that do not
   honour the specified timeout.

   Readers are advised to familiarise themselves with the security
   considerations outlined in [DRAFT-5966bis]

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is directed to assign an EDNS0 option code for the edns-tcp-
   keepalive option from the DNS EDNS0 Option Codes (OPT) registry as
   follows:

        +-------+--------------------+----------+-----------------+
        | Value | Name               | Status   | Reference       |
        +-------+--------------------+----------+-----------------+
        | [TBA] | edns-tcp-keepalive | Optional | [This document] |
        +-------+--------------------+----------+-----------------+

Internet-Draft     The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option    September 2015


   Updated references, including name change of [STARTTLS] -> [DNS-over-
   TLS] and adding reference for cache poisoning.

   Updated wording in section on Intermediary Considerations.

   Updated wording describing RRL.

   Added paragraph to security section describing client behaviour
   profiles.

   Added wording to introduction on use case for stub/resolver/
   authoritative.

A.1.2.  draft-ietf-dnsop-edns-tcp-keepalive-02

   Changed timeout value to idle timeout and re-phrased document around
   this.

   Changed units of timeout to 100ms to allow values less than 1 second.

   Change specification to remove use of the option over UDP.  This is
   potentially confusing, could cause issues with ALG's and adds only
   limited value.

   Changed semantics so the client no longer sends a timeout.  The
   client timeout is of limited value as servers should be managing
   connections based on their view of their resources, not on client
   requests as this is open to abuse.  Additionally this identifies
   cases were the option is simply being reflected back.

   Changed semantics for the meaning of a server sending a timeout of 0.
   The maximum timeout value of 6553.5s (~1.8h) is already large and a
   distinct 'connection close'-like signal is potentially more useful.

   Added more detail on server side requirements when supporting
   keepalive in terms of resource and connection management.

   Added discussion of EDNS0 per-message limitation and implications of
   this.

   Added reference to STARTTLS draft and RFC7320.

A.1.3.  draft-ietf-dnsop-edns-tcp-keepalive-01

   Version bump with no changes

A.1.4.  draft-ietf-dnsop-edns-tcp-keepalive-00
