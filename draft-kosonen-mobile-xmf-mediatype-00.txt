Abstract 
 
   The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of Music 
   Electronics industry (AMEI) have produced the Mobile XMF standard 
   [1].  The Mobile XMF standard has been developed particularly for 
   mobile MIDI [7] applications.  Mobile XMF is a very compact media 
   type providing high quality synthetic audio content for music 
   downloading and messaging applications that require MIME 
   registration.

1.  Introduction 
 
   MIDI content is used commonly in the Internet.  Commonly, MIDI data 
   is stored in the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format [8].  This MIME type 
   registration uses the Mobile XMF file format for the encapsulation of 
   SP-MIDI [3,4] and Mobile DLS [2] data. 
 
2.  Registration of audio/mobile-xmf 
 
   Type name: audio 
    
   Subtype name: mobile-xmf 
    
   Required parameters: none 
    
   Optional parameters: 
    
      revision: Mobile XMF file type revision ID 
    
         revision is the Mobile XMF file type revision ID number from 
         the XmfFileTypeRevisionID field of the XMF Meta File format 
         2.00.  revision is encoded in hex in US-ASCII. 
 
      prl: Playback resource list 
    
         prl is a string (inside double quotation marks "") containing 
         the playback resources included in all Content Description 
         MetaDataItems of the Mobile XMF file.  The string contains two 
         digit hexadecimal numbers representing data bytes from the 
         Content Description Meta Data.  The same resource is listed 
         only once.  A playback resource contains two parts: a prefix 
         and data.  prl is encoded in two-digit hex numbers concatenated 
         in a US-ASCII string. 
          
         Example: If the file includes Playback Resource Lists such as 
         [00h 01h 00h 02h] and [00h 01h 00h 03h], the corresponding prl 
         is "000100020003" containing playback resources 01, 02, and 03 
         with the prefix 00. 
          
      minimum-pr: Minimum playback requirements 
    
         minimum-pr is a string containing the Maximum Instantaneous 
         Resource (MIR) values from the first row of all MIR Count 
         Tables corresponding to the playback resources listed in prl.  
         Only the largest value from the values of the same resource is 
         chosen.  minimum-prl is encoded in two-digit hex numbers 
         concatenated in a US-ASCII string.

         minimum-pr requires the use of prl and the values in minimum-pr 
         must be in the same order as the resources in prl.  minimum-pr 
         is the most important of minimum-pr and total-pr, because it 
         defines the minimum playback requirements. 
          
         Example: If the file includes first rows of MIR Count Tables 
         such as [02h 00h] and [01h 01h] corresponding to the above 
         Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding minimum-pr is 
         "020001".  (02 is the largest of 2 and 1, 00 is the largest of 
         0, and 01 is the largest of 1.)   
          
      total-pr: Total playback requirements 
    
         total-pr is a string containing the MIR values from the last 
         row of all MIR Count Tables corresponding to the playback 
         resources listed in prl.  Only the largest value from the 
         values of the same resource is chosen.  total-pr is encoded in 
         two-digit hex numbers concatenated in a US-ASCII string. 
          
         total-pr requires the use of prl and the values in total-pr 
         must be in the same order as the resources in prl. 
          
         Example: If the file includes last rows of MIR Count Tables 
         such as [05h 02h] and [06h 01h] corresponding to the above 
         Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding total-pr is 
         "060201".  (06 is the largest of 5 and 6, 02 is the largest of 
         2, and 01 is the largest of 1.) 
    
   Encoding considerations: 
    
      mobile-xmf data is binary data and must be encoded for non-binary 
      transport; Base64 is suitable for Email. 
    
   Security considerations: 
    
      Many synthetic audio compositions have associated intellectual 
      property rights.  It is conceivable that the rights owners of 
      mobile-xmf content will want to protect their rights by applying 
      security mechanisms that prohibit the rendering of the content 
      without a legally acquired license to do so.  These mechanisms 
      would be applied externally to the Content-Type defined here; 
      mobile-xmf content itself is not encrypted internally.  mobile-xmf 
      streams do not contain executable content.  Mobile XMF players are 
      robust against corrupted mobile-xmf content, because Mobile XMF 
      players ignore unidentified content.  prl, minimum-pr, and total-
      pr parameters can be used to represent Mobile DLS playback memory 
      requirements for protecting against the excessive usage of 
      playback memory.

   Interoperability considerations: 
    
      Mobile XMF is a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) 
      specification developed by MMA and AMEI.  mobile-xmf is based on 
      the XMF 2.00 specification [5,6], which standardizes a meta file 
      format for the electronic distribution of music.  mobile-xmf data 
      is stored in XMF file format [5,6]. 
    
    
   Published specification:

        v1.0., RP-42, Los Angeles, CA, USA.  2004. 
       
      Specification is available from: 
         http://www.midi.org/about-midi/specshome.shtml 
       
   Applications which use this media type: 
    
      mobile-xmf is a synthetic audio format for the flexible 
      presentation of SP-MIDI and Mobile DLS instrument data on a wide 
      range of playback devices, particularly portable appliances such 
      as mobile phones, PDAs, and palmtop computers.
