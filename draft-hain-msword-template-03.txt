                       Internet Drafts and RFC's 
     
 Overview 
     
    This document describes the steps to create a Microsoft Word 97 or 
    later template to assist those producing Internet drafts. The 
    resulting configuration allows for simple WYSIWYG editing of drafts 
    and RFCs while producing output that is in accordance with IETF 
    draft and RFC submission specifications. (72 Characters per line, 58 
    lines per page, each line terminated by a CRLF, and each page 
    followed by a LF, etc.) Using Word's text justification and table 
    capabilities may facilitate creating ASCII stick drawings. 
     
    While the authors happen to be employed by Microsoft at the time of 
    this writing, this document is not a product of Microsoft and is 
    unsupported.  
     
    Included is a detailed description of how the RFC Text and RFC 
    Heading styles are defined. This should prove useful to those 
    wishing to do further customization work or create a similar 
    template for other versions of Microsoft Word. 
     
    It also includes a description and the source of the CRLF.EXE 
    program that is needed to create the final text file output. A pre-
    configured copy of the template in RTF format and the CRLF.EXE 
    program, can also be found at ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts 
     
     
 Conventions used in this document 
     
    In this document the steps for walking a pull-down tree are indented 
    on subsequent lines. This allows abbreviation rather than a barrage 
    of 'then click' or 'select' strings in a paragraph form. Example:

 Instructions for producing Internet drafts and RFCs 
     
    1) The "auto-formatting" Microsoft Word does can result in some 
    undesired characters when creating the IETF standardized format. 
    (E.g. it will insert special characters for quotation marks, add 
    special formatting when creating lists, etc.)  To avoid this, turn 
    off "auto formatting"  
    Tools 
       Autocorrect   
    On the property pages 'AutoFormat' and 'AutoFormat As You Type', 
    turn off all of the auto formatting options. 
     
    2) Two special styles need to be defined: RFC Heading and RFC Text. 
    If you choose automatic reference numbering or table of contents 
    (defined below), the style for Endnote Reference, Endnote Text, and 
    TOC need to be modified.  The entire draft must be written using 
    these styles for the spacing to come out correctly.  *** Do not use 
    bold, underlining, italics, etc., or you will loose the WYSIWYG

    editing feature since these settings affect the number of characters 
    that can occur on a line. When the resulting Internet draft is saved 
    as plain text, all that formatting will be lost anyway. *** 
     
    3) Print the document to the Generic Text Printer, and save the 
    output to file.  If you do not have the Generic Text Printer driver 
    installed, install it from the Control Panel. (Printers, Add 
    Printer, local/My Computer, any LPT port (you will be printing to a 
    file), select Generic, Generic/Text Only from the combo box). When 
    you print to a file a pop-up will ask for the file name. 
     
    4) Run the CRLF program to automatically add carriage returns. 
              Usage is CRLF <source> <destination> 
    Where <source> is the name of the file produced by printing to the 
    generic text printer, and <destination> is the name of the text 
    draft you are producing. Example: crlf draft-00.prn draft-00.txt 
     
 Defining Microsoft Word Page Layout and Styles 
     
    These are settings used to define the RFC Text and RFC Heading 
    styles. Note: the menu options to set these are enclosed in 
    parenthesis and are listed for Microsoft Word 97.  They may differ 
    slightly for other versions of Microsoft Word. 
     
    1) Set measurement units to points. 
    Tools 
       Options 
          General 
             Measurement units = points 
     
    2) Set margins as follows: (File, Page Setup, Margins) 
    Top:         24 pts  
    Bottom:      0 pts 
    Left:        0 pts 
    Right:       93.6 pts 
    Gutter:      0 pts 
    Header:      0 pts 
    Footer:      0 pts 
     
    The right margin is what determines 72 characters per line. Using 12 
    pt font, 10 chars/inch, 72 chars = 7.2".  Using paper that is 8.5" 
    wide. 8.5" - 7.2" = 1.3" = 93.6 pts   If you get "one or more 
    margins are outside the printable area" message, select Ignore.  
    This seems to depend on the printer you currently have selected. 
     
    3) Set paper size as follows: 
    File 
       Page Setup  
          Paper Size 
                 Width:  612 pt (8.5") 
                 Height: 696 pt (12pt * 58 lines per page) 
     
    The height of the paper is what determines 58 lines per page.

    NOTE: Line Spacing Exactly 12pt is very important. Set this through 
    Format: Paragraph 
     
    6) Define a RFC Text Style.

    Line Spacing and indent are set through Format, Paragraph.  This 
    leaves a 3 character left indent for the RFC text

 Positioning the document identifiers on the first page 
     
    The 'Table' tool can be used to assist with justification of the 
    document identifiers on the first page. Each cell in the table 
    maintains its own justification characteristics, so getting left and 
    right justification on the same line is simplified. On the Toolbar 
    select the icon that looks like a grid with a dark bar across the 
    top. This will pop-up a table array. Drag the mouse across to select 
    the number of rows and columns (for the opening header 4 rows x 2 
    columns, unless there are several authors). Select the table that 
    was just inserted by click-and-hold in the left margin, and then 
    clear the boarders.  
    Format 
       Borders and Shading 
          None 
     
    Select the cells on the right (position the cursor just above the 
    top cell, when the cursor becomes an arrow pointing down, click) and 
    set justification right. (The default is to take justification from 
    the line it is being positioned on, so the left column shouldn't 
    need changing.) 
    Format 
       Paragraph 
          Right 
     
    Move the center divider to the right if necessary for the document 
    title. Select the left column of cells, then position the cursor 
    over the dividing line. When it changes to parallel bars with 
    right/left arrows, click-and-hold, then drag the line as necessary. 
     
 Automatic reference numbering 
     
    To support automatic updates of reference numbers, make the 
    following changes. (Requires the document to be a single section 
    prior to the Reference heading.) 
     
    1) Insert a section break on the line after Reference heading. 
    Insert 
       Break 
         Section Break 
            Continuous

    3) Set up the location of the references, and number style.

       Footnote 
         Endnote

         Options 
            Place at 'End of section' 
            Numeric style '1,2,3'  
     
    4) Select the location for the first reference. Between the user 
    typed [ ] characters insert an endnote.  
    Insert 
       Footnote (endnote will already be selected, as will auto 1,2,3) 
          OK 
    When the endnote is inserted the lower pane will appear. Type in the 
    text for the reference. The first time a reference is inserted the 
    Endnote Separator should be cleared (the continuation separator may 
    need it as well). Find the pull down just above the reference text, 
    and change it to each of the options to make sure all but the 'All 
    Endnotes' are cleared.  
    Endnote Separator  
       Select and delete any text 
     
    The reference number in the text and the endnote table will 
    automatically track as changes are made. If the endnote window is 
    closed and changes need to be made, select

 Final fixup: the CRLF program 
     
    Each line needs to be terminated by a CRLF, but when printing your 
    document to the Generic Text Printer driver, some blank lines will 
    be terminated only with a line feed. Consider a traditional text 
    line printer, printing a line of text, followed by 3 blank lines.  
    The output would look as follows: 
     
    Line of Text<CR><LF><LF><LF>. 
     
    This was done because there was no need to move the print carriage 
    head for the blank lines, only line feeds were necessary. 
     
    CRLF.EXE is a Win16/32 program to fix up the output from the various 
    versions of the Generic Text Printer driver so that each line is 
    terminated by a CRLF.  An extra line that makes the first page be 59 
    lines, instead of the required 58 is also removed.   
     
    Following example provides source for a CRLF fixup program.

    Known problems 
     
    Printing 
     
    If you try to print the draft you are working on from within 
    Microsoft Word to an actual printer (not to a file using the Generic 
    Text printer driver), you may receive an error message indicating 
    the margins are outside of the printable area of the printer.  If 
    you continue printing, the first 2 characters of each heading will 
    be truncated.  It is recommended you produce a printed copy of the 
    draft you are working on by using the CRLF program to produce a text 
    file, and then redirect it to a printer (so that you do not need to 
    deal with other programs like NOTEPAD, etc. adding their own 
    margins.) Example:  
     
    - Print to a file using the generic text printer 
    - CRLF draft.prn draft.txt 
    - NET USE lpt1 <\\printername\sharename> 
    - TYPE draft.txt > LPT1 
     
    As an alternative, if the final draft.txt file is opened with Word, 
    setting all 4 margins to .65" will position it on the page. 
    File 
       Page Setup 
          Top    .65 
          Bottom .65 
          Left   .65 
          Right  .65 
     
    The Underscore character 
     
    If you use the underscore character "_" within the RFC Text and RFC 
    Heading style, it will not be displayed on most screens.  (It 
    appears as a blank space.)  It will print correctly and will appear 
    as an underscore character in the final draft output. 
  
     
 Formal Syntax 
     
    The formal definition of RFC format is defined in RFC-2223 [1] and 
    Internet Draft instructions are available at [2]. 
     
     
 Security Considerations 
  
    Caution is advised when opening any document that may contain a 
    macro virus. The template files originally provided to the Internet-
    drafts & RFC editors did not contain any macros, and unless tampered 
    with should not now. If there are concerns about using the template 
    doc file, the instructions provided here will allow creation of one 
    from scratch. Further details about Microsoft Word macro virus 
    concerns are available at: http://www.microsoft.com/ . To find the 
    current documents, search for 'macro virus'.
