Internet-Draft    'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding for HTTP       April 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) content
   coding (Section 3.1.2.1 of [RFC7231]) that can be used to describe
   the location of a secondary resource that contains the payload.

   The primary use case for this content coding is to enable origin
   servers to securely delegate the delivery of content to a secondary
   server that might be "closer" to the client (with respect to network
   topology) and/or able to cache content ([SCD]), leveraging content
   encryption ([ENCRYPTENC]).

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terminology used in the base HTTP
   specifications, namely Section 2 of [RFC7230] and Section 3 of
   [RFC7231].

3.  'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding

3.1.  Overview

   The 'Out-Of-Band' content coding is used to direct the recipient to
   retrieve the actual message representation (Section 3 of [RFC7231])
   from a secondary resource, such as a public cache:

   1.  Client performs a request

   2.  Received response specifies the 'out-of-band' content coding; the
       payload of the response contains additional meta data, plus the
       location of the secondary resource

   3.  Client performs GET request on secondary resource (usually again
       via HTTP(s))

   4.  Secondary server provides payload

   5.  Client combines above representation with additional
       representation metadata obtained from the primary resource

   (4) <---------------------------/

   (5)
      Client and combines payload received in (4)
      with metadata received in (2).

3.2.  Definitions

   The name of the content coding is "out-of-band".

   The payload format uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, [RFC7159]),
   describing an object describing secondary resources plus OPTIONAL
   additional metadata:

   'URIs'  A REQUIRED string array containing at least one URI reference
      (Section 4.1 of [RFC3986]) of a secondary resource.

   'fallback'  An OPTIONAL string containing a URI reference of a
      fallback resource (see Appendix B.1).  This URI reference, after
      resolution against the URI of the primary resource, MUST identify
      a resource on the same server as the primary resource.

   'metadata'  An OPTIONAL object containing additional members,
      representing header field values which can not appear as header
      fields in the response message itself (header fields that occur
      multiple times need to be combined into a single field value as
      per Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]; header field names are lower-
      cased).

   The payload format uses a JSON array so that the origin server can
   specify multiple secondary resources.  When a client receives a
   response containing multiple URIs, it is free to choose which of
   these to use.

   New specifications can define new OPTIONAL header fields, thus
   clients MUST ignore unknown fields.  Extension specifications will
   have to update this specification. [[anchor3: or we define a
   registry]]

3.3.  Processing Steps

   Upon receipt of an out-of-band encoded response, a client first needs
   to obtain the secondary resource's presentation.  This is done using
   an HTTP GET request (independantly of the original request method).

   In order to prevent any leakage of information, the GET request for
   the secondary resource MUST NOT contain any information provided by
   origins other than the secondary server itself, namely HTTP
   authentication credentials ([RFC7235]) and cookies ([RFC6265]).

   Furthermore, the request MUST include an "Origin" header field
   indicating the origin of the original resource ([RFC6454], Section
   7).  The secondary server MUST verify that the specified origin is
   authorized to retrieve the given payload (or otherwise return an
   appropriate 4xx status code).

   After receipt of the secondary resource's payload, the client then
   reconstructs the original message by:

   1.  Unwrapping the encapsulated HTTP message by removing any transfer
       and content codings.

   2.  Replacing/setting any response header fields from the primary
       response except for framing-related information such as Content-
       Length, Transfer-Encoding and Content-Encoding.

   3.  Replacing/setting any header fields with those present as members
       in the "metadata" object. [[anchor4: Do we have a use case for
       this?]]

   If the client is unable to retrieve the secondary resource's
   representation (host can't be reached, non 2xx response status code,
   payload failing integrity check, etc.), it can choose an alternate
   secondary resource (if specified), try the fallback URI (if given),
   or simply retry the request to the origin server without including
   "out-of-band" in the Accept-Encoding request header field.  In the
   latter case, it can be useful to inform the origin server about what
   problems were encountered when trying to access the secondary
   resource; see Section 3.4 for details.

   Note that although this mechanism causes the inclusion of external
   content, it will not affect the application-level security properties
   of the reconstructed message, such as its web origin ([RFC6454]).

   The cacheability of the response for the secondary resource does not
   affect the cacheability of the reconstructed response message, which
   is the same as for the origin server's response.

Internet-Draft    'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding for HTTP       April 2016


   Note that because the server's response depends on the request's
   Accept-Encoding header field, the response usually will need to be
   declared to vary on that.  See Section 7.1.4 of [RFC7231] and Section
   2.3 of [RFC7232] for details.

3.4.  Problem Reporting

   When the client fails to obtain the secondary resource, it can be
   useful to inform the origin server about the condition.  This can be
   accomplished by adding a "Link" header field ([RFC5988]) to a
   subsequent request to the origin server, detailing the URI of the
   secondary resource and the failure reason.

   The following link extension relations are defined:

3.4.1.  Server Not Reachable

   Used in case the server was not reachable.

   Link relation:

   http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/not-reachable

3.4.2.  Resource Not Found

   Used in case the server responded, but the object could not be
   obtained.

   Link relation:

   http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/resource-not-found

3.4.3.  Payload Unusable

   Used in case the the payload could be obtained, but wasn't usable
   (for instance, because integrity checks failed).

   Link relation:

   http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/payload-unusable

3.5.1.  Basic Example

   Client request of primary resource at https://www.example.com/test:

     GET /test HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.example.com
     Accept-Encoding: gzip, out-of-band


   Response:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Date: Thu, 14 May 2015 18:52:00 GMT
     Content-Type: text/plain
     Cache-Control: max-age=10, public
     Content-Encoding: out-of-band
     Content-Length: 145
     Vary: Accept-Encoding

     {
       "URIs": [
         "http://example.net/bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00"
       ],
       "fallback": "/c/bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00"
     }

   (note that the Content-Type header field describes the media type of
   the secondary's resource representation, and the origin server
   supplied a fallback URI)

   Client request for secondary resource:

     GET /bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.net
     Origin: https://www.example.com


   Response:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Date: Thu, 14 May 2015 18:52:10 GMT
     Cache-Control: private
     Content-Length: 15

     Hello, world.

   (Note no Content-Type header field is present here because the
   secondary server truly does not know the media type of the payload)

   Final message after recombining header fields:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Date: Thu, 14 May 2015 18:52:00 GMT
     Content-Length: 15

     Content-Type: text/plain

     Hello, world.

3.5.2.  Example for an attempt to use out-of-band cross-origin

   Section 3.3 requires the client to include an "Origin" header field
   in the request to a secondary server.  The example below shows how
   the server for the secondary resource would respond to a request
   which contains an "Origin" header field identifying an unauthorized
   origin.

   Continuing with the example from Section 3.5.1, and a secondary
   server that is configured to allow only access for requests initiated
   by "https://www.example.org":

   Client request for secondary resource:

     GET /bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.net
     Origin: https://www.example.com


   Response:

     HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
     Date: Thu, 14 May 2015 18:52:10 GMT


   Note that a request missing the "Origin" header field would be
   treated the same way.

   [[anchor7: Any reason why to *mandate* a specific 4xx code?]]

3.5.3.  Example involving an encrypted resource

   Given the example HTTP message from Section 5.4 of [ENCRYPTENC], a
   primary resource could use the "out-of-band" encoding to specify just
   the location of the secondary resource plus the contents of the
   "Crypto-Key" header field needed to decrypt the payload:

       ]
     }

   (note that the Content-Type header field describes the media type of
   the secondary's resource representation)

   Response for secondary resource:

      Note: in this case, the ability to undo the "aescgm128" is needed
      to process the response.  If "aescgm128" wasn't listed as
      acceptable content encoding in the request, the origin server
      wouldn't be able to use the "out-of-band" mechanism.

3.5.4.  Example For Problem Reporting

   Client requests primary resource as in Section 3.5.1, but the attempt
   to access the secondary resource fails.

   Response:

     HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
     Date: Thu, 08 September 2015 16:49:00 GMT
     Content-Type: text/plain
     Content-Length: 20

     Resource Not Found

   Client retries with the origin server and includes Link header field
   reporting the problem:

     GET /test HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.example.com
     Accept-Encoding: gzip, out-of-band
     Link: <http://example.net/bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00>;
           rel="http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/resource-not-found"


4.  Content Codings and Range Requests

   The combination of content codings ([RFC7231], Section 3.1.2 with
   range requests ([RFC7233]) can lead to surprising results, as
   applying the range request happens after applying content codings.

   Thus, for a request for the bytes starting at position 100000 of a
   video:

     GET /test.mp4 HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.example.com
     Range: bytes=100000-
     Accept-Encoding: identity

Internet-Draft    'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding for HTTP       April 2016


   ...a successful response would use status code 206 (Partial Content)
   and have a payload containing the octets starting at position 100000.

     HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
     Date: Thu, 08 September 2015 16:49:00 GMT
     Content-Type: video/mp4
     Content-Length: 134567
     Content-Range: bytes 100000-234566/234567

     (binary data)

   However, if the request would have allowed the use of out-of-band
   encoding:

     GET /test.mp4 HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.example.com
     Range: bytes=100000-
     Accept-Encoding: out-of-band


   ...a server might return an empty payload (if the out-of-band encoded
   response body would be shorter than 100000 bytes, as would be usually
   the case).

   Thus, in order to avoid unnecessary network traffic, servers SHOULD
   NOT apply range request processing to responses using ouf-of-band
   content coding (or, in other words: ignore "Range" request header
   fields in this case).

5.  Feature Discovery

   New content codings can be deployed easily, as the client can use the
   "Accept-Encoding" header field (Section 5.3.4 of [RFC7231]) to signal
   which content codings are supported.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Content Modifications

   This specification does not define means to verify that the payload
   obtained from the secondary resource really is what the origin server
   expects it to be.  Content signatures can address this concern (see
   [CONTENTSIG] and [MICE]).

6.2.  Content Stealing

   The Out-Of-Band content coding could be used to circumvent the same-

Internet-Draft    'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding for HTTP       April 2016


   site which knows the URI of a secondary resource would use the out-
   of-band coding to trick the user agent to read the contents of the
   secondary resource, which then, due to the security properties of
   out-of-band codings, would be handled as if it originated from the
   origin's resource.

   This scenario is addressed by the client requirement to include the
   "Origin" request header field and the server requirement to verify
   that the request was initiated by an authorized origin.

      Note: similarities with the "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing"
      protocol ([CORS]) are intentional.

   Requiring the secondary resource's payload to be encrypted
   ([ENCRYPTENC]) is an additional mitigation.

6.3.  Use in Requests

   In general, content codings can be used in both requests and
   responses.  This particular content coding has been designed for
   responses.  When supported in requests, it creates a new attack
   vector where the receiving server can be tricked into including
   content that the client might not have access to otherwise (such as
   HTTP resources behind a firewall).

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA "HTTP Content Coding Registry", located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters>, needs to be
   updated with the registration below:

   Name:  out-of-band

   Description:  Payload needs to be retrieved from a secondary resource

Appendix A.  Alternatives, or: why not a new Status Code?

   A plausible alternative approach would be to implement this
   functionality one level up, using a new redirect status code (Section
   6.4 of [RFC7231]).  However, this would have several drawbacks:

   o  Servers will need to know whether a client understands the new
      status code; thus some additional signal to opt into this protocol
      would always be needed.

Internet-Draft    'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding for HTTP       April 2016


   o  In redirect messages, representation metadata (Section 3.1 of
      [RFC7231]), namely "Content-Type", applies to the response
      message, not the redirected-to resource.

   o  The origin-preserving nature of using a content coding woudld be
      lost.

   Another alternative would be to implement the indirection on the
   level of the media type using something similar to the type "message/
   external-body", defined in [RFC2017] and refined for use in the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in [RFC4483].  This approach though
   would share most of the drawbacks of the status code approach
   mentioned above.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

B.1.  Accessing the Secondary Resource Too Early

   One use-case for this protocol is to enable a system of "blind
   caches", which would serve the secondary resources.  These caches
   might only be populated on demand, thus it could happen that whatever
   mechanism is used to populate the cache hasn't finished when the
   client hits it (maybe due to race conditions, or because the cache is
   behind a middlebox which doesn't allow the origin server to push
   content to it).

   In this particular case, it can be useful if the client was able to
   "piggyback" the URI of the fallback for the primary resource, giving
   the secondary server a means by which it could obtain the payload
   itself.  This information could be provided in yet another Link
   header field:

     GET bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.net
     Link: <http://example.com/c/bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00>;
           rel="http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/primary-resource"


   (continuing the example from Section 3.5.1)

B.2.  Resource maps

   When out-of-band encoding is used as part of a caching solution, the
   additional round trips to the origin server can be a significant
   performance problem; in particular, when many small resources need to
   be loaded (such as scripts, images, or video fragments).  In cases
   like these, it could be useful for the origin server to provide a
   "resource map", allowing to skip the round trips to the origin server



Reschke & Loreto        Expires October 17, 2016               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding for HTTP       April 2016


   for these mapped resources.  Plausible ways to transmit the resource
   map could be:

   o  as extension in the out-of-band encoding JSON payload, or

   o  as separate resource identified by a "Link" response header field.

   This specification does not define a format, nor a mechanism to
   transport the map, but it's a given that some specification using
   "out-of-band" encoding will do.

B.3.  Padding

   It might be a good idea to allow padding in the secondary resource's
   payload, in order to even hide the precise content length.  This
   could be accomplished by adding range information to the out-of-band
   metadata, allowing the client to throw away parts of the payload when
   reconstructing the response body.

B.4.  Fragmenting

   It might be interesting to divide the original resource's payload
   into fragments, each of which being mapped to a distinct secondary
   resource.  This would allow to not store the full payload of a
   resource in a single cache, thus

   o  distribute load,

   o  caching different parts of the resource with different
      characteristics (such as only distribute the first minutes of a
      long video), or

   o  hide information from the secondary server.

   Another benefit might be that it would allow the origin server to
   only serve the first part of a resource itself (reducing time to play
   of a media resource), while delegating the remainder to a cache
   (however, this might require further adjustments of the out-of-band
   payload format).

Appendix C.  Change Log (to be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

C.1.  Changes since draft-reschke-http-oob-encoding-00

   Mention media type approach.

   Explain that clients can always fall back not to use oob when the
   secondary resource isn't available.

   Add Vary response header field to examples and mention that it'll
   usually be needed
   (<https://github.com/reschke/oobencoding/issues/6>).

   Experimentally add problem reporting using piggy-backed Link header
   fields (<https://github.com/reschke/oobencoding/issues/7>).

C.2.  Changes since draft-reschke-http-oob-encoding-01

   Updated ENCRYPTENC reference.

C.3.  Changes since draft-reschke-http-oob-encoding-02

   Add MICE reference.

   Remove the ability of the secondary resource to contain anything but
   the payload (<https://github.com/reschke/oobencoding/issues/11>).

   Changed JSON payload to be an object containing an array of URIs plus
   additional members.  Specify "fallback" as one of these additional
   members, and update Appendix B.1 accordingly).

   Discuss extensibility a bit.

C.4.  Changes since draft-reschke-http-oob-encoding-03

   Mention "Content Stealing" thread.

   Mention padding.

C.5.  Changes since draft-reschke-http-oob-encoding-04

   Reduce information leakage by disallowing ambient authority
   information being sent to the secondary resource.  Require "Origin"
   to be included in request to secondary resource, and require seconday
   server to check it.

   Mention "Origin" + server check on secondary resource as defense to
   content stealing.

   Update ENCRYPTENC reference, add SCD reference.

   Mention fragmentation feature.

   Discuss relation with range requests.
