   procedures in a Multimedia Telephony Service (MTS) context. The 
   reference SP network infrastructure is assumed to be based on 
   MPLS/Diffserv Control and Data Planes. The proposed architecture is 
   defined signalling independent because it is able to uphold different 
   signalling protocols used by the MTS-enabled terminals (e.g. SIP, 
   H.323, H.248-Megaco, MGCP, etc.) with a common approach. The overall 
   specification relies on the identification of a common and 
   generalized semantic for the service requests (policy & CAC), which 
   will encapsulate the client-specific information in a common format 
   besides of the specific protocol (e.g. SIP, H.323, etc.). 
   By means of this generalized architecture it is possible to reduce 
   the complexity of the SP Control Plane architecture.

1. Introduction 
   Multimedia Telephony Services (e.g. voice/video calls, SMS/MMS 
   services, multi-party audio/video conference) based on all-IP 
   networks poses new challenging requirements for the infrastructures 
   of Service Providers (SP) in terms of end-to- end Quality of Service 
   (QoS), dynamical and tailored network resource management, 
   security/privacy, service availability, service resiliency, etc.  
   All these issues are supported by the traditional PSTN for the basic 
   telephony services, but they cannot be effectively and natively 
   provided by the standard IP networks, which are based on the flat 
   "best-effort" and connectionless paradigm. 
   Focusing on the SP network, the presence of heterogeneous multimedia 
   applications requiring QoS guarantees on the boundary of its network 
   entails general requirements for: 
    
     - flexibility/modularity of the SP architecture, in order to 
       provide new multimedia services with the least possible impact on  
       the SP internal infrastructure; 
     - scalability of the SP network, in order to scale well with the  
       increasing of service demands from the users through the related  
       access networks; 
     - dynamicity of the service provisioning, in order to offer  
       dynamically (i.e. as long as the end-user needs) a transport  
       service for the MTS with QoS guarantees (both at Layer 3 and at 
       Layer 2); 
     - tailoring of the SP QoS-enabled transport services, in order to  
       allocate the amount of network resources that exactly fulfil the  
       end-user requirements in terms of bandwidth, delays, jitter, etc. 
 
   This specification aims to define some extensions to the COPS 
   protocol under the COPS-MAID client type to be used in a signalling

   independent architecture for the SP Control Plane. This architecture 
   satisfies the requirements for flexibility and scalability of the 
   network, as well as dynamicity and tailoring of the related transport 
   services. This control plane architecture is defined signalling 
   independent because it is able to uphold different signalling 
   protocols used by the MTS-enabled terminals (e.g. SIP, H.323, H.248-
   Megaco, MGCP, etc.) with a common approach, according to a 
   "classical" User-Network Interface concept. 
    
    
    
2. MAID network architecture 
   The requirement for end-to-end QoS guarantees for MTS sessions 
   implies that the SP network must comprise QoS-capable equipment. The 
   most effective and common choices that currently gather scalability 
   and manageability are Diffserv [5], MPLS [6] and a mixed MPLS/ 
   Diffserv solution [3], which merges the Control Plane features of 
   MPLS with the differentiation and scheduling tools provided by 
   Diffserv. 
   The Multi-Access Inter-Domain (MAID) SP network derives from this 
   rationale and it relies on a mixed MPLS/Diffserv architecture (both 
   Control and Data Planes). 
   The MAID Data Plane provides the mapping and the forwarding of the IP 
   flows from the access network into the proper Diffserv PHBs/LSPs 
   (labels) and vice versa. 
   The MAID Control Plane is responsible for Admission Control (AC) and 
   policy decisions (taken on a per-flow or per-PHB basis) and for the 
   service level agreement (SLA) maintenance. 
    
   Focusing on the Control Plane side, the SP network is a collection of 
   functionalities and components, in support of signalling, security, 
   billing, inter-working of domains, etc. relying on the coordination 
   function of an MTS Call Agent (e.g. the H.323 Gatekeeper, or the SIP 
   Proxy or a softswitch in general). After a successful phase of 
   subscription and registration of end-users to the SP services, upon 
   receiving a service request for an MTS call from an end-user, the SP 
   control plane is triggered to provide:  
    
     1. the authorization, authentication and accounting of the end- 
        user; 
     2. the call control through a MTS Call Agent; 
     3. the inter-working with peering domains of the same or different  
        technologies (e.g. neighbouring TDM domains or other  
        SIP/H.323 domains); 
     4. the setup/selection/update/release of the QoS-enabled IP service  
        in the SP data plane that can accommodate the final MTS call, in  
        case across a chain of SP domains.

   The last step, i.e. the selection of a just running QoS-enabled IP 
   service and/or the set-up of a new one inside the SP network, is the 
   main QoS-related step and it relies on the action of a Transport 
   Network Resource Manager (TNRM), also known as Bandwidth Broker (BB). 
    
   The TNRM has the main role of managing network resources by means of 
   proper configurations of the Traffic Control (TC) modules in the 
   involved QoS-capable IP/MPLS routers, as well as the Layer 2 priority 
   mechanisms of the involved L2 devices. TC is the set of policing, 
   filtering, marking, shaping and scheduling procedures available on 
   the IP routers for QoS enforcement purposes.  
    
   The triggers for TNRM actions can be: 
    
     - requests for call admission control originated by the MTS Call 
       Agent and related to the MTS signalling 
     - some provisioning information (e.g. traffic matrix like) 
    
   These two solutions are generally classified as outsourcing and 
   provisioning approaches. Outsourcing allows a dynamic distribution of 
   available resources, even if it requires the continuous TNRM 
   invocation and, thus, it implies scalability issues. On the contrary, 
   provisioning relies on the pre-allocation of a set of policies (and a 
   certain amount of resources) by the TNRM to external Policy 
   Enforcement Points. In this case TNRM acts as a Policy Decision 
   Point. It would be desirable to adopt a mixed provisioning/ 
   outsourcing scheme, in order to address both the scalability and 
   resource optimisation issues. 
    
   The scalability issues raised by the different MTS architectures  
   (e.g. H.323, SIP, etc.) interoperating with the single TNRM encourage 
   the definition of a common syntax for admission control and policy 
   requests despite of the native MTS signalling protocol (e.g. SIP, 
   H.323, H.248, etc.) and of the SP internal network architecture (e.g. 
   Diffserv, MPLS or both). This approach allows shifting the complexity 
   of the network on a single module, the Signalling Translation 
   Function (STF), which is related to the MTS Call Agent and, thus, can 
   be distributed in different network elements.  
    
   The main actions provided by STF are: 
    
     - to map the QoS semantic of the specific MTS signalling protocol  
       into a generalized and common semantic for the QoS-enabled IP 
       service request; 
     - to provide the inter-working with the native signalling protocol  
       dynamics (i.e. message flows), depending on the result of the  
       admission control phase by the TNRM.

Internet Draft   draft-carrozzo-aaa-cops-maid-00.txt         May 2005 
 
 
   The STF translation do not extend nor modify the native MTS 
   signalling, but it simply supports the MTS signalling by providing 
   the missing correlation between the signalling/media negotiation and 
   the relative actions in the SP transport network in terms of QoS 
   configuration and enforcement. 
    
    
    
3. The COPS-MAID rationale 
   This specification focuses on the possibility of integrating 
   different MTS protocol architectures through the STF module. Since a 
   per-protocol QoS semantic can be identified from the MTS call 
   signalling messages, it is possible to derive a minimum set of 
   information the TNRM must know in order to provide a correct policy 
   decision and call admission control.  
    
   This common semantic is comprised of: 
     - Traffic origin: 
         > host which originated the flow; 
         > Border Router (BR) interface where the traffic will pass  
           through; 
     - Traffic direction: 
         > egress BR for the flow; 
         > core routers the flow will go across (got from a Path 
           Computation System); 
     - Traffic type: 
         > traffic characterization; 
         > QoS parameters; 
     - Temporal information (optional) 
         > start time, end time, repetition intervals; 
    
   Besides of the specific signalling protocol used by the clients, the 
   QoS-sensible information highlighted above MUST be passed from the 
   STF to the TNRM via a specific protocol. Different protocols can be 
   extended for this purpose (e.g. DIAMETER, SIP, etc.). In this 
   specification some extensions to the COPS protocol are proposed under 
   the COPS-MAID client type (MAID, Multiple-Access Inter-Domain). 
    
   COPS (Common Open Policy Service) [3] is a simple query and response 
   protocol that can be used to exchange policy information in an 
   administrative domain. Relying on the client-server model, COPS 
   architecture is based on two fundamental elements: a policy server, 
   called Policy Decision Point (PDP), also addressed as COPS server, 
   and one or more policy clients, called Policy Enforcement Points 
   (PEPs), addressed as COPS clients. At least one policy server must 
   exist in each administrative domain, in order to implement a complete 
   COPS communication with one or more PEPs. 
   A single PEP is able to support multiple client-types, and it may 
   send multiple Client-Open messages to the PDP, each specifying a

Internet Draft   draft-carrozzo-aaa-cops-maid-00.txt         May 2005 
 
 
   particular client-type to a PDP over one or more TCP connections. If 
   a client-type is not supported by the PDP, the PDP itself can 
   redirect the PEP to an alternative PDP address and port for a given 
   client-type via COPS. 
   A client type is already defined for the integration of RSVP and COPS 
   [4], where RSVP is COPS client-type 1. The proposed standard has some 
   weak points due to the nature of RSVP itself, e.g. the duplication of 
   the states installed both in PDP and in PEP which limits the 
   scalability of the model and the possibility of expanding the core 
   domain.  
   A possible solution to this scalability problem is an administrative 
   domain with many PDP supporting one or few client-types each. 
   Whenever a PEP sends a client-open message to a PDP, that does not 
   support that client-type, it has the capability to redirect the PEP 
   to the right PDP. This solution is more scalable but needs to 
   implement many COPS servers, one for each of the supported client-
   types within the domain. All these COPS servers have to exchange 
   management information to perform a coherent resource allocation, or 
   they must query for a higher level "omniscient" Bandwidth Broker. 
    
   In this specification a unified COPS semantic is proposed in order to 
   integrate all the different protocols supported by the access domain. 
   This semantic will encapsulate the client-specific information in a 
   common format besides of the specific protocol. 
   By means of this generalized architecture it is possible to reduce 
   the complexity of the system, because: 
     - a unified COPS client-type transmits all the information to the 
       PDP; 
     - it is no longer needed to develop a different COPS server (PDP) 
       for each supported COPS client; 
     - there is no need to refer to a higher-level device when 
       performing resource allocation because the unique COPS server  
       (PDP) could be located inside the Bandwidth Broker or TNRM.  
    
   The COPS-MAID client type and the related objects are defined in the 
   following sections.  
    
    
    
4. COPS-MAID extensions 
    
   The meaning and usage of several COPS objects is affected when used 
   with the COPS-MAID client type. This section describes these objects 
   and their usage. 
    
    
4.1  Client Type  
    
   COPS-MAID is COPS client-type TBD.

4.2  Context Object 
    
   The semantics of the Context object for COPS-MAID is as follows: 
    
     - R-Type (Request Type Flag)  
       > R-Type = 0x01: Incoming-Message/Admission Control Requests;  
       > R-Type = 0x02: Resource Allocation Request;  
       > R-Type = 0x08: Configuration request;  
    
   For the COPS-MAID client-type the R-Type flag 0x04 (Outgoing-Message 
   Request) is not used.  
    
     - M-Type (Message Type) 
       > M-Type = 0x01: Add request; 
       > M-Type = 0x02: Release request; 
       > M-Type = 0x03: Modify request; 
    
    
4.3  COPS-MAID Protocol Objects Format 
    
   All the objects described in this section must be intended as 
   objects/attributes encapsulated within other "higher level" COPS 
   objects. In particular, they are carried in the COPS-MAID Client 
   Specific Information Object (ref. 5.1 for the PEP -> PDP 
   communication) and in the Client Specific Decision Object (ref. 5.2 
   for the PDP -> PEP direction). 
   These COPS-MAID objects have a TLV format (Type-Length-Value) where 
   Type (16 bit) identifies univocally the object, Length (16 bit) 
   indicates the length of the object in Bytes (including the header) 
   and Value is the content of the object.  
    
    0             7               15                              31

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
4.4  Request ID Object 
    
   This object is carried in the Client Specific Information Object of a 
   Request Message sent from a PEP to a PDP, or in the Client Specific 
   Decision data sent from a PDP to a PEP. It allows binding requests 
   sent by the PEP and having the same COPS Handle Object with responses 
   coming from the PDP (ref. [3]). This mechanism allows a COPS-MAID PEP 
   to make more than one request for a specific state (identified by the 
   Handle Object) before receiving a PDP response.

   The Request ID Object is chosen by the PEP and it is opaque to the 
   PDP. For each request a different Request ID is chosen by the PEP. 
   Request ID values can be reused if they are associated to different 
   Handle Objects.

4.5  Source Host IPv4 address Object 
    
   This object specifies the IPv4 address of the host originating the 
   flow for which a PDP decision is requested. It is carried in the 
   Client Specific Information Object of a Request Message sent from a 
   PEP to a PDP or in the Client Specific Decision data sent from a PDP 
   to a PEP. The host IP address could be useful to the TNRM in order to 
   perform Authorization operations.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
4.6  Destination IPv4 address Object 
    
   This object specifies the IPv4 address of the host which is the

   in the Client Specific Information Object of a Request Message sent 
   from a PEP to a PDP or in the Client Specific Decision data sent from 
   a PDP to a PEP.  
   The destination address is needed each time the MTS Call Agent is not 
   aware of the egress router for the traffic flow for which is 
   performing the request. Moreover, the destination address could be 
   useful to the TNRM in order to perform flow authorization operations.

4.15  QoS Class Description Object 
    
   This object specifies the QoS class to which the traffic flow belongs 
   to. Four different QoS classes are defined:  
    
     - Class Type = 0x00000001: bounded losses;  
     - Class Type = 0x00000002: guaranteed bandwidth;  
     - Class Type = 0x00000003: guaranteed bandwidth + bounded delay;  
     - Class Type = 0x00000004: guaranteed bandwidth + bounded delay +  
                                bounded jitter.  
    
   Each one of these classes has more stringent QoS guarantees than the 
   previous class.

4.16  QoS Parameters Description Object 
    
   This object defines the QoS parameters requested. Four different 
   parameters are defined:  
    
     - bandwidth;  
     - delay;  
     - jitter;  
     - loss probability;  
    
   For each of the previous parameters a slack term could be indicated: 
   while the bandwidth slack term must be subtracted to the bandwidth 
   parameter in order to find the minimum allowed bandwidth, the jitter 
   and delay slack terms must be added to the respective parameters in 
   order to find the maximum allowed delay and jitter.

4.19  Temporal information object 
    
   The temporal information object is used to specify the time interval 
   inside which the request is valid. It is carried in the Client 
   Specific Information Object of a Request Message sent from a PEP to a 
   PDP or in the Client Specific Decision data sent from a PDP to a PEP. 
   y means of this object one or more time intervals and/or periodically 
   repeated time intervals could be defined.  
   An ASCII string is used to describe the temporal information. If the 
   string length is not multiple of 32 bits appropriate zero padding 
   bytes are used.

   The ASCII string starts with "{" and ends with "}". Each time 
   interval is specified internally to the characters "[" and "]". This 
   time interval is the intersection of the time intervals (separated by 
   the character "-") specified internally to the characters "<" and 
   ">". Otherwise the global time interval is the union of all the time 
   intervals specified internally to the characters "[" and "]". The 
   character ("*") is used as wildcard.

4.20  Explicit Route object 
    
   The contents of an Explicit Route object are a series of variable-
   length data items called sub-objects. An explicit route is a 
   particular path in the network topology. An explicit route is 
   described as a list of groups of nodes along the explicit route. In 
   addition to the ability to identify specific nodes along the path, an 
   explicit route can identify a group of nodes (called abstract node) 
   that must be traversed along the path. This capability allows the 
   routing system a significant amount of local flexibility in 
   fulfilling a request for an explicit route. This capability allows 
   the generator of the explicit route to have imperfect information 
   about the details of the path. 
   The explicit route is encoded as a series of sub-objects contained in 
   an ERO object. Each sub-object identifies a group of nodes in the 
   explicit route. An explicit route is thus a specification of groups 
   of nodes to be traversed. 
   This object is used by the PDP to inform the MPLS-enabled ingress BR 
   (LER) of the MPLS/Diffserv SP network that an MPLS signalling session 
   (e.g. via RSVP-TE protocol) must be initiated to setup an LSP. It is 
   carried in the Client Specific Decision Data Object of a Decision 
   Message sent from a PDP to a PEP.

4.20.1  ERO Sub-objects 
    
   Each sub-object has the form: 
    
   0             7               15                              31

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               + 
   |                              ...            | 
   |                           Sub-object contents                 | 
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   The L bit is an attribute of the sub-object. The L bit is set if the 
   sub-object represents a loose hop in the explicit route. If the bit 
   is not set, the sub-object represents a strict hop in the explicit 
   route. The path between a strict node and its preceding node MUST 
   include only network nodes from the strict node and its preceding 
   abstract node. The path between a loose node and its preceding node 
   MAY include other network nodes that are not part of the strict node 
   or its preceding abstract node. 
   The Type indicates the type of contents of the sub-object. Currently 
   defined values are: 
     - Type = 0x01: IPv4 prefix 
     - Type = 0x02: IPv6 prefix 
     - Type = 0x20: Autonomous system number 
    
   The Length contains the total length of the sub-object in bytes, 
   including the L, Type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be at least 
   4, and MUST be a multiple of 4. 
    
4.20.1.1  Sub-object 1:  IPv4 prefix

   The Ingress interface IPv4 address (32) is treated as a prefix based 
   on the prefix length (8 bit) value below. Bits beyond the prefix are 
   ignored on receipt and SHOULD be set to zero on transmission. 
   Note that a prefix length of 32 indicates a single IPv4 node.

   Note that a prefix length of 128 indicates a single IPv6 node. 
    
4.20.1.3  Sub-object 32:  Autonomous System Number 
    
   The contents of an Autonomous System (AS) number sub-object are a 4-
   octet AS number.  The abstract node represented by this sub-object is 
   the set of nodes belonging to the autonomous system.

Security Considerations 
    
   The extensions proposed in this document do not raise any new 
   security concerns with respect to those declared in [3]. 
    
    
    
IANA Considerations 
    
   Within this document a new COPS Client Type (COPS-MAID) is defined 
   and it needs to be assigned in compliancy with the IANA assignments 
   for the COPS protocol parameters: 
    
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/cops-parameters 
    
   A Client-type values within the range 0x0001-0x3FFF (Specification 
   Required) could apply to this specification, since the behavior and 
   applicability of the COPS-MAID extensions are hereby described. 
   The other extensions described in this document are in the form of 
   TLV sub-objects carried by the COPS-MAID Client Specific Information 
   Object (ref. 5.1 for the PEP -> PDP communication) and in the Client 
   Specific Decision Object (ref. 5.2 for the PDP -> PEP direction).
