     1. Introduction 

        This memo was produced by the DHCP Working Group and defines a 
        portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network 
        management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it 
        describes a set of extensions that DHCP and Bootstrap Protocol 
        (BOOTP) servers implement.  Many implementations support both DHCP 
        and BOOTP within a single server and hence this memo describes the 
        MIB for both DHCP and BOOTP servers. 

        This memo does not cover DHCP/BOOTP client nor relay agent MIB 
        extensions:  these are possibly the subjects of future investigation 
        [see discussion in section 2.1.]  Also excluded from this MIB 
        extension in the interest of simplicity are DHCP Dynamic DNS 
        Updating, Failover, Authentication, and Load Balancing:  these 
        functions and features could be subjects of future MIB extensions.

        Provision is also made for Standards-Track additions to the DHCP 
        Message Type (option 61.) 

        This memo is based on the Internet-standard Network Management 
        Framework as defined by documents [RFC2578, RFC2579, RFC2580]. 

        Objects defined in this MIB allow access to and control of DHCP 
        Server Software.  Servers MAY also provide additional management 
        capabilities through the use of the Applications MIB [RFC2287]. 

        The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," 
        "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED,"  "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in document [RFC2119]. 


     2. Overview 

        In the tradition of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) the 
        minimum number of objects possible are defined in this MIB, while 
        still providing as rich a set of management information as possible.  
        An object is left out of this MIB when it can be derived from other 
        objects that are provided.  Further to the tradition of the SNMP, 
        computationally intense operations are left to the domain of the 
        management station.  Thus, this MIB provides a set of objects from 
        which other management information may be derived. 

        The examples provided in sections 2.3 through 2.5 are not meant to be 
        comprehensive but are illustrative of the potential uses of the 
        objects defined by this MIB.

     2.1. Relationship to Other MIBs 


     2.1.1. DHCP MIB Extensions 

        The DHCP MIB extensions will the "dhcp" branch of the standard MIB-2 
        tree, as illustrated by the following diagram: 

                                 +-------+ 
                                 | MIB-2 | 
                                 +---+---+ 
                                     | 
                                     | 
                                 +---+---+ 
                                 |  dhcp | 
                                 +---+---+ 
                                     | 
                                     | 
              +---------------+------+---------+---------------------+ 
              |               |                |                     | 
        +-----+-----+   +-----+----+   +-------+--------+     +------+------+ 
        |  dhcp-v4  |   |  dhcp-v4 |   |    dhcp-v4     |     | dhcp-v6 MIB | 
        |Server MIB |   |Client MIB|   |Relay Agent MIB |     | Extensions  | 
        |(this memo)|   | (future) |   | (future work)  |     |   (future)  | 
        +-----------+   +----------+   +----------------+     +-------------+ 
         

        The MIBs will share a common branching point, but are independently 
        defined. 


     2.1.2. Host System MIB Extensions 

        The Host System MIB [RFC1123] provides for information, command, and 
        control of the host computer system on which a DHCP server resides.  
        The DHCP Server MIB specifically does not include any objects that 
        may be accessible using the Host System MIB. 


     2.1.3. DHCPv6 Server MIB Extensions 

        When this set of MIB extensions is developed, it will share a common 
        branch point in the MIB tree with the other DHCP MIB Extensions.

     2.1.4. DHCP Client MIB Extensions 

        If this set of MIB extensions is ever developed, it will share a 
        common branch point in the MIB tree with the other DHCP MIB 
        Extensions, and will use many of the same textual conventions. 


     2.1.5. DHCP Relay Agent MIB Extensions 

        If this set of MIB extensions is ever developed, it will share a 
        common branch point in the MIB tree with the other DHCP MIB 
        Extensions, and will use many of the same textual conventions. 


     2.2. Textual Conventions Introduced in this MIB 

        Severaal conceptual data types have been introduced as textual 
        conventions in this DHCP MIB document.  These additions will 
        facilitate the common understanding of information used by the DHCP 
        server.  No changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to support 
        these conventions. 


     2.2.1. DhcpTimeInterval 

        This data type measures time intervals since the beginning of some 
        epoch in milliseconds. 


     2.2.2. HardwareAddressType 

        This data type contains the type of hardware address represented by 
        MacAddress, as defined for ARP messages. 


     2.2.3. HardwareAddressLength 

        The length in octets of MacAddress is contained in this type. 


     2.2.4. MacAddress 

        The actual layer 1 hardware address is contained in this data type. 


     2.2.5. PhysicalAddress 

        This data type combines the hardware type octet with the length and 
        hardware (NIC or MAC) address to produce a unique address type.

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB             February 2002 
      
     2.2.6. DhcpLabel 

        This data type contains labels used as identifiers by DHCP servers. 


     2.3. BOOTP and DHCP Counter Groups 

        This section describes some of the management information that may be 
        derived from the objects provided in the counter groups. 

        The total number of valid DHCP packets received by the server is 
        computed as the sum of the dhcpCountDiscovers, dhcpCountRequests, 
        dhcpCountReleases, dhcpCountDeclines, dhcpCountInforms and 
        dhcpCountLeaseQueries objects.  The total number of valid packets 
        (BOOTP and DHCP) received is computed as the total number of valid 
        DHCP packets plus the value of the bootpCountRequests object.  The 
        total number of packets received is computed as the total number of 
        valid packets plus the sum of bootpCountInvalids and 
        dhcpCountInvalids. 

        Similar to the received computations, the total number of DHCP 
        packets sent by the server is computed as the sum of the 
        dhcpCountOffers, dhcpCountAcks, dhcpCountNacks, 
        dhcpCountForcedRenews, dhcpCountKnowns, and dhcpCountUnknowns 
        objects.  The number of packets (BOOTP and DHCP) sent by the server 
        is computed as the total number of DHCP packets sent plus the value 
        of the bootpCountReplies object. 


     2.4. BOOTP and DHCP Optional Statistics Group 

        This section describes some of the management information that may be 
        derived from the objects provided in the optional statistics group. 

        Given time 1 (t1) and time 2 (t2) greater than t1, the mean inter-
        arrival time of valid DHCP messages for the interval t1 to t2 can be 
        computed as (dhcpStatLastArrivalTime at t2 minus 
        dhcpStatLastArrivalTime at t1) divided by (valid DHCP received packet 
        count at t2 minus valid DHCP received packet count at t1). 

        Under the simplifying assumption that the capture of packet counts 
        and times is discontinuous (that is, for the measurement interval the 
        captured data represents the complete set for the server) the 
        variance of the mean may be computed as 
        (dhcpStatSumSquaresArrivalTime at t2 less 
        dhcpStatSumSquaresArrivalTime at t1) divided by (valid DHCP received 
        packet count at t2 less valid DHCP received packet count at t1).  
        Standard deviation of the mean is the square root of the variance.

        Calculation of statistics for message response time is entirely 
        similar to the calculations for inter-arrival time, except that the 
        response time objects are used for the calculations. 

        Calculation of statistics for BOOTP is similar to the calculations 
        for DHCP, except that the similar objects from the 
        bootpOptionalStatistics group are used instead of the objects from 
        dhcpOptionalStatistics group.server Configuration Group 

        The server configuration group contains objects that describe the 
        configuration information that is contained in the server.  Some of 
        the configuration information is static (e.g., a statically 
        configured IP address) and some of the configuration is dynamic 
        (e.g., an assigned DHCP lease).  The intent of the server 
        configuration group is to be able to read the server's configuration.  
        Mechanisms outside of the SNMP are currently in use (e.g., vendor 
        defined solutions) and are being standardized (e.g., the Directory 
        Enabled Networks [DEN] initiative) to update a server's 
        configuration. 

        The configuration information defines a minimal set of information 
        that most servers should be able to provide.  Each row of the 
        serverSubnetTable lists the subnet, the subnet mask, and the subnet 
        that is equivalent to this subnet.  Equivalence is defined as more 
        than one subnet being present on the same network segment as some 
        other subnet. 

        The serverRangeTable lists the start and end IP addresses of the 
        ranges and the subnet of which the range is a member.  The 
        serverRangeInUse object indicates the amount of the range that is 
        currently in use, either through dynamic allocation or being 
        reserved.  The range size can be computed by taking the difference of 
        the serverRangeStart and serverRangeEnd objects. 

        The serverAddressTable provides information about the static and 
        dynamic addresses that the server contains in its configuration.  
        Addresses may be: 

          o Static, in which case they are predefined though the server's 
            configuration.  Static addresses may or may not have been 
            previously served by the server; 

          o Dynamic, in which case the server has served the addresses and 
            it is currently in active use by a host; 

          o Expired, in which case the server had previously assigned for 
            which the lease time has expired, but is retained by the server 
            for possible future use by the same client;

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB             February 2002 
      
          o Configuration-reserved, in which case the address is not 
            available for the server to allocate to a client.  A 
            configuration-reserved address is one that has been reserved by 
            the administrator.  An example of a configuration-reserved 
            address is an address that is assigned to a client, not through 
            DHCP (e.g., statically assigned), and the address is within a 
            DHCP range; and 

          o Server-reserved, in which case the server has taken the address 
            out of use.  Examples of server-reserved addresses are those 
            which have been declined (i.e., through a DHCPDECLINE) by a 
            client or those which have responded to an ICMP echo before they 
            were assigned. 

        The protocol used to allocate the address may be determined from the 
        serverAddressServedProtocol object.  This object indicates whether 
        the address has never been served, or whether BOOTP or DHCP was used 
        to allocate the address. 


     2.5. Response Times and ICMP Echo 

        According to [RFC2131], servers SHOULD try to determine if an address 
        is in use before assigning it.  Some servers choose not to perform 
        this check, letting the client determine for itself if the address is 
        in use.  Other servers perform an ICMP echo (Ping) just prior to 
        assigning an address.  Servers that perform a Ping before responding 
        to a DHCPDISCOVER should not include in the response time the time 
        from when the Ping was transmitted until the time that either a 
        response was received or that the server timed out waiting for a 
        response.

     5. Notes 

        This section will be removed when this memo goes to Working Group 
        Last Call. 


     5.1. Issues 

        Not all of these issues have been resolved, even in the latest (-07) 
        draft.  Some may become items for future study, while some will 
        probably be dropped. 

        o  Are placeholders for expected DHCP option values a good or bad 
           idea? 

        o  Ryan Troll proposed four or five traps that Nathan Lane 
           enthusiastically supported, but it has been difficult to achieve 
           any consensus (or, for that matter, much interest) in them. 

        o  What is the best way to reset counters and statistics?  Is it 
           necessary to reset them at all?  The -07 draft does not declare 
           any counters as read-write or read-create, primarily to avoid 
           these questions, as well as to provide fundamental security over 
           objects. 

           -- Do we need to reset them individually, as groups, or as a 
              whole? 

           -- Do we need a timestamp of when they were reset? 

        o  Should all invalid packets received be collapsed into a single 
           counter for each protocol type (BOOTP and DHCP), or broken out by 
           type of error? 

        o  If counted by error type, what is the set of errors that we should 
           use? 

        o  Perhaps we should develop a common vocabulary (and glossary) for 
           terms such as "abandoned" so that the objects defined and their 
           descriptions aren't misinterpreted by implementers. 

        o  Do we need to be concerned about the potential size of some of the 
           configuration data tables?  Wouldn't it be better to maintain 
      
     Hibbs & Waters       Expires: Feb 2002 + 6 months           [Page 40] 











     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB             February 2002 
      
           counters for things like number of leases assigned than to expect 
           the management station to calculate the values by reading very 
           large tables to count the number of leases in that state? 


     5.2. Changes from Prior Drafts 

        The "-01" revision removed the Server Identity section from the 
        proposed MIB, relying on the Application MIB to accomplish the same 
        result. 

        The min/max (inter-arrival and response times) were changed to 
        Unsigned32 so that they could be reset.  Sums of inter-arrival and 
        response times were deleted since the management station can easily 
        calculate them.  The last arrival time objects were added. 

        The "-03" version incorporated the proposed configuration tables 
        suggested by Ryan Troll of CMU.  The "01" revision of this version 
        added three elements to the server subnet table, number of 
        outstanding offers, number of addresses in use, and number of free 
        addresses, as well as changing subnet address to subnet mask in the 
        server address, server range, and client address tables.  The client 
        MAC address element of the client address table was separated into a 
        1-octet hardware type and a 16-octet client hardware address, causing 
        a renumbering of the elements in this table.  Clarifying text was 
        added to several element descriptions, and limitations on values, and 
        the reported value when the server did not support the data element 
        were also specified.  This version also incorporated an address 
        change for one of the authors, revisions to standard text required by 
        the IETF, and some editorial clarifications. 

        The "-04" version changed the maximum size of the object 
        serverAddressHostName from 64 to 255 octets, and added clarifying 
        text to both that object and to serverAddressDomainName regarding the 
        practical values for the length of both objects. 

        The "-05" version added a number of traps suggested by Kim Kinnear, 
        made a number of small renaming and renumbering changes (annotated in 
        the MIB itself) and added the Shared Network concept to describe 
        shared network segments: several subnetworks that coexist on one 
        medium.  This was done partly because the Address Range concept did 
        not adequately describe the "scoping" of address pools as is common 
        with many current server implementations.  Also updated the authors 
        address and contact information, and incorporated a number of 
        corrections and amplifications suggested by various readers of the "-
        04" draft, including a missing OID for serverNotifyObjects and a 
        syntax error for PhysicalAddress. 

        The "-06" version corrects a number of flaws reported by Rick Geesen 
        and Jin Tao, mostly caused by typographical errors in the "-05" 
      
     Hibbs & Waters       Expires: Feb 2002 + 6 months           [Page 41] 











     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB             February 2002 
      
        version as well as some unintentionally omitted text for 
        serverNotifyObjects. 

        The "-07" version changes BOOTP and DHCP statistics from mandatory to 
        optional, renaming object identifiers as required to match.  All 
        objects, tables, and groups in previous drafts for Dynamic DNS 
        updating and Failover have been removed.  All tables were carefully 
        examined to be certain that they really could be simply implemented.  
        Many items were renamed or renumbered.  Placeholder definitions of 
        message types (both requests and responses) were added to support 
        DHCPFORCERENEW, DHCPQUERY, DHCPKNOWN, and DHCPUNKNOWN.  A few [more] 
        typographical errors were found and fixed.  Because of an error 
        posting the 07 draft to the editor's queue it was not accepted in 
        time for IETF-52 and is being submitted to the Internet-Drafts editor 
        with one change identified by Alan Hackert.  Finally, some of the 
        initial text was brought in line with standard requirements for 
        Internet-Drafts. 


     6. Acknowledgements 

        This document is the result of work undertaken the by DHCP working 
        group.  The editors would like to particularly acknowledge the 
        development team from Carnegie-Mellon University whose work creating 
        a private MIB for their DHCP server inspired the development of this 
        proposal.  In particular, many thanks to Ryan Troll who provided a 
        great deal of useful feedback during the development of this MIB. 

        Thanks to Ryan Troll, Nathan Lane, Kim Kinnear, Yannick Koehler, 
        Nathan Lane, Rick Geesen, Jin Tao, James Brister, and Alan Hackert 
        for their review, comments, and contributions. 


     7. Security Considerations 

        There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
        ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Such objects may be 
        considered sensitive or vulnerable in some environments.  The support 
        for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
        protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  Many 
        network administrators object to settable management objects because 
        of the limited security features of SNMPv1 and SNMPv2.  We have 
        chosen not to fight that battle in constructing this MIB. 

        SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
        itself is secure (for example by using IPSEC), there is no control as 
        to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET / SET (read 
        / change / create / delete) the objects in this MIB.

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB             February 2002 
      
        SNMPv2 communities provide a minimal level of access control, but it 
        is recommended that the implementers consider the security features 
        as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the 
        User-based Security Model [RFC2274] and the View-based Access Control 
        Model [RFC2275] is recommended. 

        It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
        entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
        configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
        (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
        (change/create/delete) them. 

        Denial of Service attacks on a DHCP server are conceivable by 
        flooding the SNMP (sub-)agent with requests, tying up host system and 
        server resources processing SNMP messages.  The authors know of no 
        way to wholly prevent such attacks, but have attempted to construct 
        relatively simple tables to minimize the work required to respond to 
        messages.
