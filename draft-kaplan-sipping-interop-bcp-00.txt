1. Introduction 
    
   SIP has grown both in terms of vendor/customer adoption and protocol 
   complexity, with numerous implementations, and differing 
   assumptions, leading to numerous interoperability issues.  Unlike 
   some other protocols, it suffers from a lack of either a single 
   dominant vendor, or of a single autocratic standards body.  The 
   large number of vendors involved, from different regions of the 
   World, and the differences in needs and wants of the customers of 
   those vendors, has led to a complicated interoperability problem 
   space. 
    
   This document lists some of the more common interoperability issues 
   encountered in deployments, and provides BCP recommendations for how 
   to avoid or resolve them. 
    
    
2. Applicability 
    
   This draft is focused on SIP interoperability issues only.

3. General Interoperability Issues 
 
    
3.1. Response code issues  
    
   There are numerous reasons a given response code may be sent, and in 
   some cases more than one response code may be appropriate, which has 
   led to differing expectations and behaviors.  The need to resolve 
   such conflicts between domains of proxies has led to middle-boxes 
   changing the response codes, which may well exacerbate the problem 
   in the future. 
    
   In general the interoperability problems that arise are where the 
   upstream proxies or UAC perform automatic re-attempts to alternate 
   paths for certain response codes but not others, and such action 
   cannot be known in advance to the downstream device.  For example a 
   404 Not Found or 480 Temporarily Unavailable are commonly returned 
   by a proxy when it cannot find a route to the target for any number 
   of reasons, and this response causes some upstream nodes to try 
   alternate paths and some not to.  Because a 404/480 can be returned 
   for a variety of reasons, some of which should cause a re-route and 
   some not, some vendors send different response codes than 404/480 
   for those conditions: response codes which are more explicit about 
   whether a re-route is the appropriate action. 
    
   Another example is 503, which seems to cover everything from 
   temporary overload conditions, administrative-down state, permanent 
   failure, and as a catch-all for anything not easily identified by 
   other codes.  Some devices treat this response code as a semi-
   permanent condition for the next-hop, and avoid sending any 
   subsequent requests to the next-hop for a sustained period of time, 
   which may or may not be the correct action to take.  Unfortunately 
   the upstream nodes have no idea which downstream proxy actually 
   generated the 503. 
    
   [See "REGISTER response behavior" section for related problems] 
    
3.2. SIP field and message lengths 
    
   While the RFCs do not define any maximum lengths for SIP header 
   fields (values, parameters, etc.) or SIP messages, the reality of 
   computing technology is such that vendors often do impose maximum 
   lengths for received fields and messages.  Whether it's due to 
   security concerns, product architecture, logging constraints, etc., 
   the fact is there are many systems which cannot or will not handle 
   fields as large as other systems can generate.  Although [RFC3261] 
   does define some specific response codes (413/414/513) for this 
   case, it does not fix the underlying interoperability issue.

   Devices cannot simply stop sending larger fields based on a SIP 
   response code.   
    
   This issue has been appearing more frequently lately, with the use 
   of embedded cookies in URIs and parameter growth.  
    
3.2.1     Recommended Behavior 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that a UA, B2BUA or Proxy not generate any SIP 
   field longer than 256 bytes.  This includes any header parameters, 
   URI, and header value.  It is RECOMMENDED that a Proxy, B2BUA, and 
   UA be able to process SIP fields of at least 1024 bytes in length. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that a UA or B2BUA not generate any SIP message 
   size larger than 64,000 bytes.  Note this is not 65,535, in order to 
   accommodate message growth due to header insertion in Proxies.  It 
   is RECOMMENDED that a Proxy, B2BUA, or UA be able to process SIP 
   messages of at least 65,535 bytes. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that a UA or B2BUA not generate any SIP message 
   bodies larger than 32,768 bytes.  It is RECOMMENDED that a B2BUA or 
   UA be able to process SIP message bodies of at least 64,000 bytes in 
   length. 
    
    
3.3. SIP and TEL URI formats 
    
   Despite all RFC wording to the contrary, the SIP URI format has seen 
   widespread use as essentially the semantic equivalent of the TEL 
   URI, albeit with different syntax.  Many provider systems treat 
   sip:16035551212@example.net as logically equivalent to 
   tel:+16035551212, even though the former has local scope to 
   example.net only, and the latter has global scope.  Part of the 
   reason for this, I believe, is that originating UA's have no real 
   way of knowing when a URI should be one or the other - the user 
   pressed digit buttons and hit "send", and all the UAC can do is send 
   the request to sip:[digits]@[local-domain].  It doesn't know the 
   numbers pressed were global in scope, or even E.164 numbers.  Only 
   the routing proxies know this, and even then they only know the 
   numbers they're each responsible for.  Thus we see the domain 
   portion of SIP URIs getting replaced by middle-boxes at provider 
   boundaries, if the username portion looks like an E.164 number.   
    
   Furthermore, many systems have either been designed or provisioned 
   to handle only one scheme type (i.e., SIP URIs).  This has led to 
   cases where requests are rejected unless the appropriate URI scheme 
   is used, and frequently that single common scheme needs to be used 
   in more than just the request-URI (e.g., To and From URI's as well).  
   This wholesale replacement of schemes and domain names in URIs leads

   to interop issues when the same URIs are expected to be used for 
   end-to-end purposes, in headers or XML bodies the middle-boxes do 
   not or cannot change.  The most recent example is [RFC4474] sip-
   identity. 
    
3.3.1     Recommended Behavior 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that a UA or B2BUA only use SIP URIs for any SIP 
   header field values which need a URI; for example the request URI, 
   To, From, Contact, P-Asserted-Identity, P-Called-Party-ID, P-
   Associated-URI, History-Info, and so on.  It is RECOMMENDED that a 
   UA, B2BUA, or Proxy be able to process/support Tel and SIPS URI's 
   per their associated RFC's. 
    
4. Specific Interoperability Issues 
    
4.1. Offer-less Invites and Re-Invites 
    
   Although this is clearly a device implementation issue (i.e., a 
   "bug"), we have seen numerous devices from different vendors have 
   trouble handling Invites or re-Invites that do not contain SDP.  For 
   initial Invites without SDP, often the root cause for failure is 
   that specific request routing or admission decision logic of 
   intermediate devices depends on the SDP; for example devices which 
   route calls based on codec, or bandwidth allocation devices, or 3PCC 
   transcoding devices which themselves send out offer-less Invites but 
   didn't expect to receive such. (Apparently they never considered 
   that a call could cross two such systems!) 
    
   For re-Invites, the delayed SDP offer model is performed for very 
   specific use cases which are common, but were simply not envisioned 
   by the developers of the UA's. 
    
4.1.1     Recommended Behavior  
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that a UAC provide the SDP offer with its INVITE 
   requests.  A UAS or B2BUA MUST support receiving an INVITE without 
   an SDP offer. 
    
4.2. REGISTER response behavior 
    
   Another form of the interop problems that arise from responses is 
   the behavior of UA's with regard to Registration and Subscribe 
   response handling.  For example, only a minority of UA's properly 
   support 3xx redirects for REGISTER, even though it would be a useful 
   mechanism for load-balancing.  For REGISTER requests specifically, 
   it would be beneficial if there was explicit documentation of what 
   actions should be performed by the UAC. 
    
 
 
Kaplan                 Expires - September 2009               [Page 5] 
                       SIP Interoperability BCP             March 2009 
 
 
   To reinforce this point, consider that UA's perform Registrations 
   and Subscriptions in a fairly automatic fashion with little user 
   interaction, and so the way in which they treat specific response 
   codes can have dramatic consequences.  For example, it is not well-
   defined what a UA should do when its REGISTER is rejected with a 
   404, or even 503, and hardly any UA's honor the Retry-After header.  
   A very few UA's will give up altogether and wait for user input; 
   some UA's will wait a few minutes and try again, indefinitely; some 
   will re-attempt their Registration almost immediately, even faster, 
   and never give up.  This creates numerous problems in large network 
   deployments, and has led SBC vendors to implement various protection 
   schemes - from dynamic hardware ACLs, to even sending a 200 ok just 
   to shut the UA up. 
    
4.3. Call-hold signaling 
    
   The legacy mechanism defined in [RFC2543] for call-hold by setting 
   the SDP connection address to 0.0.0.0 is unfortunately far from 
   obsolete in usage, despite the superior direction attribute concept 
   of [RFC3264].  To increase interoperability, some devices send both 
   types in the re-Invite, which defeats the purpose of using a 
   direction attribute (e.g., keeping RTCP flowing).  Other vendors 
   send the direction attribute first, and if the SDP answer does not 
   mirror it they use the legacy approach, which leads to extraneous 
   signaling overhead. An IETF recommendation/BCP for this is probably 
   warranted.  In hindsight [RFC3264] should have been backwards 
   compatible (e.g., still using the 0.0.0.0 syntax with some new 
   attribute for on-hold connection address, which would be ignored by 
   legacy devices but used by newer ones). [note: I recognize this is 
   SDP not SIP, but it's a big deal and was caused by rfc2543]
