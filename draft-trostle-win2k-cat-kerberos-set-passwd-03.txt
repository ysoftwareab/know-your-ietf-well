1. Abstract

   This memo specifies the Windows 2000 Kerberos [1] change password and
   set password protocols. The Windows 2000 Kerberos change password
   protocol interoperates with the original Kerberos change password
   protocol. Change password is a request reply protocol that includes a
   KRB_PRIV message that contains the new password for the user.

   The original change password protocol does not allow an administrator
   to set a password for a new user. This functionality is useful in

   some environments, and this proposal extends the change password
   protocol to allow password setting. The changes are: adding new
   fields to the request message to indicate the principal which is
   having its password set, not requiring the initial flag in the
   service ticket, using a new protocol version number, and adding three
   new result codes.

2.  The Protocol

   The service accepts requests on UDP port 464 and TCP port 464 as
   well. The protocol consists of a single request message followed by a
   single reply message.  For UDP transport, each message must be fully
   contained in a single UDP packet.

   For TCP transport, there is a 4 octet header in network byte order
   that precedes the message and specifies the length of the message.
   This requirement is consistent with the TCP transport header in
   1510bis.

   All 16 bit fields are in big-endian order.

   message length field: contains the number of bytes in the message
   including this field.

   protocol version number: contains the hex constant 0xff80 (big-endian
   integer).

   AP-REQ length: length of AP-REQ data, in bytes. If the length is
   zero, then the last field contains a KRB-ERROR message instead of a
   KRB-PRIV message.

   AP-REQ data: (see [1]) The AP-REQ message must be for the service
   principal kadmin/changepw@REALM, where REALM is the REALM of the user
   who wishes to change/set his password. The ticket in the AP-REQ must
   must include a subkey in the Authenticator. To enable setting of
   passwords, it is not required that the initial flag be set in the
   Kerberos service ticket.

   KRB-PRIV message (see [1]) This user-data field in the KRB-PRIV
   message is encrypted using the subkey from the authenticator in the
   AP-REQ data. The usec and seq-number fields of the KRB_PRIV message
   are present and have the same value as the seq-number field in the

   authenticator from the AP_REQ message (the seq-number in the
   authenticator will be present). The server ignores the optional r-
   address field in the KRB_PRIV message, if it is present.

   The user-data component of the message consists of the following
   ASN.1 structure encoded as an OCTET STRING:

      ChangePasswdData ::=  SEQUENCE {
                          newpasswd[0]   OCTET STRING,
                          targname[2]    PrincipalName OPTIONAL,
                          targrealm[3]   Realm OPTIONAL
                          }

   The server must verify the AP-REQ message, check whether the client
   principal in the ticket is authorized to set/change the password
   (either for that principal, or for the principal in the targname
   field if present), and decrypt the new password. The server also
   checks whether the initial flag is required for this request,
   replying with status 0x0007 if it is not set and should be. An
   authorization failure is cause to respond with status 0x0005. For
   forward compatibility, the server should be prepared to ignore fields
   after targrealm in the structure that it does not understand.

   The newpasswd field contains the cleartext password, and the server
   will apply any local policy checks including password policy checks.
   The server then generates the appropriate keytypes from the password
   and stores them in the KDC database. If all goes well, status 0x0000
   is returned to the client in the reply message (see below).

   All 16 bit fields are in big-endian order.

   message length field: contains the number of bytes in the message
   including this field.

   protocol version number: contains the hex constant 0x0001 (big-endian
   integer). (The reply message has the same format as the original
   change password protocol).

   AP-REP length: length of AP-REP data, in bytes. If the length is
   zero, then the last field contains a KRB-ERROR message instead of a
   KRB-PRIV message.

   AP-REP data: the AP-REP is the response to the AP-REQ in the request
   packet.

   KRB-PRIV message: This KRB-PRIV message must be encrypted with the
   subsession key from the authenticator in the AP-REQ data.

   The server will respond with a KRB-PRIV message unless it cannot
   decode the client AP-REQ or KRB-PRIV message, in which case it will
   respond with a KRB-ERROR message. NOTE: Unlike change password
   version 1, the KRB-ERROR message will be sent back without any
   encapsulation.

   The user-data component of the KRB-PRIV message, or e-data component
   of the KRB-ERROR message, consists of the following data.

     0                   1                   2                   3

   result code (16 bits) (result codes 0-4 are from the original change
   password protocol):

        The result code must have one of the following values
        (big-endian integer):

        KRB5_KPASSWD_SUCCESS             0 request succeeds (This value
                                           is not allowed in a KRB-ERROR
                                           message)

        KRB5_KPASSWD_MALFORMED           1 request fails due to being
                                           malformed

        KRB5_KPASSWD_HARDERROR           2 request fails due to "hard"
                                           error in processing the
                                           request (for example, there
                                           is a resource or other
                                           problem causing the request
                                           to fail)

        KRB5_KPASSWD_AUTHERROR           3 request fails due to an error
                                           in authentication processing

        KRB5_KPASSWD_SOFTERROR           4 request fails due to a
                                           "soft" error in processing
                                           the request

        0xFFFF is returned if the request fails for some other reason.
        Although only a few non-zero result codes are specified here,
        the client should accept any non-zero result code as indicating
        failure.

   result string:
        This field contains information which might be useful to
        the user, such as feedback about policy failures.  The string
        is encoded in UTF-8.  It may be omitted if the server does not
        wish to include it.  If it is present, the client will display
        the string to the user.

3. Security Considerations

   Password policies should be enforced to make sure that users do not
   pick passwords (for change password) that are vulnerable to brute
   force password guessing attacks. An administrator who is authorized
   to set other principal's passwords is highly trusted and must also
   carefully protect his/her own credentials.
