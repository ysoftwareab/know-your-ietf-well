1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community for
   the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

   The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] describes objects used
   for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per
   [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].  These object descriptions are
   based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations
   Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute
   (ANSI) T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication
   Union (ITU-T) G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

   The MIB module described in RFC 4706 [RFC4706] is a wider management
   model that includes, in addition to ADSL technology, the ADSL2 and
   ADSL2+ technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5 ([G.992.3],
   [G.992.4], and [G.992.5] respectively).

   This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662], or RFC 4706
   [RFC4706] but rather provides a more comprehensive management model
   that addresses the VDSL2 technology per G.993.2 ([G.993.2]) as well
   as ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies.

   Additionally, the management framework for VDSL2 lines [TR-129]
   specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken
   into consideration.  That framework is based on ITU-T G.997.1
   standard [G.997.1].

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


   Note that the management model according to this document does not
   allow managing VDSL technology per G.993.1 ([G.993.1]).  VDSL lines
   MUST be managed by RFC 3728 [RFC3728].

   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission,
   as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of
   this document.

2.1.  Relationship to other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with other
   MIB modules described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as presented in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863] is discussed.

2.1.1.  General IF-MIB Integration (RFC 2863)

   The VDSL2 Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
   The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes, which may be applicable
   for VDSL2 lines as well as for ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines:

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       channel(70),     -- Channel
       adsl(94),        -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop
       ...
       interleave(124), -- Interleaved Channel
       fast(125),       -- Fast Channel
       ...
       adsl2plus(238),  -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop Version 2,
                           Version 2 Plus, and all variants
       vdsl2(xxx),      -- Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Loop 2
       ...
       }

   ADSL lines that are identified with ifType=adsl(94) MUST be managed
   with the MIB specified by RFC2662.  ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines
   identified with ifType=adsl2plus(238) MUST be managed with the MIB
   specified by RFC 4706 [RFC4706].  VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+
   lines identified with ifType=vdsl2(xxx) MUST be managed with the MIB
   specified by this document.

   In any case, the SNMP agent may use either ifType=interleave(124) or
   fast(125) for each channel, e.g., depending on whether or not it is
   capable of using an interleaver on that channel.  It may use the
   ifType=channel (70) when all channels are capable of using an

   interleaver (e.g., for ADSL2 xtus).

   Note that the ifFixedLengthGroup from RFC 2863 [RFC2863] MUST be
   supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB
   module.

2.1.2.  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by ifType contains tables appropriate for
   the interface types described above.  Most such tables extend the
   ifEntry table, and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems
   implementing this MIB module, those table entries indexed by ifIndex
   MUST be persistent.

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863], and are
   not duplicated in the VDSL2 Line MIB.

      ifSpeed               Set as appropriate.

2.2.  IANA Considerations

   The VDSL2-LINE-MIB module requires the allocation of a new ifType
   value for Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Loop Version 2, to
   distinguish between ADSL lines that are managed with the RFC2662
   management model, ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines that are managed with
   the RFC 4706 [RFC4706] management model, and VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and
   ADSL2+ lines that are managed with the model defined in this
   document.

   Also the VDSL2-LINE-MIB module requires the allocation of a single
   object identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY.  The IANA should allocate
   this object identifier in the transmission subtree.

   section), the various transmission modes, power states,
   synchronization states, possible values for various configuration
   parameters, status parameters, and other parameter types.

   o  Xdsl2Unit:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify each unit in the
      VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.  It mirrors the EOC addressing
      mechanism:

         xtuc(1)                - central office (CO) terminal unit
         xtur(2)                - customer premises equipment (CPE)
                                  terminal unit

   o  Xdsl2Direction:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify a transmission
      direction in a VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.  The upstream
      direction is a transmission from the remote end (xTU-R) towards
      the central office end (xTU-C).  The upstream direction is
      indicated by upstream(1).  The downstream direction is a
      transmission from the xTU-C towards the xTU-R.  The downstream
      direction is indicated by downstream(2).

         upstream(1)        - Transmission from the xTU-R to the xTU-C.
         downstream(2)      - Transmission from the xTU-C to the xTU-R.


   o  Xdsl2Band:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify a band in a VDSL2/
      ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.  For a band in the upstream direction,
      transmission is from the remote end (xTU-R) towards the central
      office end (xTU-C).  A band in the upstream direction is indicated
      by upstream(1) for ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ single band, or any of
      us0(3), us1(5), us2(7), us3(9), or us4(11) for VDSL2 multiple
      bands.  For a band in the downstream direction, transmission is
      from the xTU-C towards the xTU-R.  A band in the downstream
      direction is indicated by downstream(2) for ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+
      single band, or any of ds1(4), ds2(6), ds3(8), or ds4(10) for
      VDSL2 multiple bands.

         upstream(1)        - Transmission from the ATU-R to the ATU-C
         (ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+).
         downstream(2)      - Transmission from the ATU-C to the ATU-R
         (ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+).
         us0(3)             - Upstream band number 0 (US0) (VDSL2).
         ds1(4)             - Downstream band number 1 (DS1) (VDSL2).
         us1(5)             - Upstream band number 1 (US1) (VDSL2).

         us2(7)             - Upstream band number 2 (US2) (VDSL2).
         ds3(8)             - Downstream band number 3 (DS3) (VDSL2).
         us3(9)             - Upstream band number 3 (US3) (VDSL2).
         ds4(10)            - Downstream band number 4 (DS4) (VDSL2).
         us4(11)            - Upstream band number 4 (US4) (VDSL2).

   o  Xdsl2TransmissionModeType:

      Attributes with this syntax reference the list of possible
      transmission modes for VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+.

      Specified as a BITS construct, there are currently a few dozen

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


      transmission modes in the list.

   o  Xdsl2RaMode:

      Attributes with this syntax reference if and how Rate-Adaptive
      synchronization is being used on the respective VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2
      or ADSL2+ link:

         manual (1)    - No Rate-Adaptation.  The initialization process
                         attempts to synchronize to a specified rate.
         raInit (2)    - Rate-Adaptation during initialization process
                         only, which attempts to synchronize to a rate
                         between minimum and maximum specified values.
         dynamicRa (3) - Dynamic Rate-Adaptation during initialization
                         process as well as during SHOWTIME.

   o  Xdsl2InitResult:

      Attributes with this syntax reference the recent result of a full
      initialization attempt:

         noFail (0)             - Successful initialization
         configError (1)        - Configuration failure
         configNotFeasible (2)  - Configuration details not supported
         commFail (3)           - Communication failure
         noPeerAtu (4)          - Peer ATU not detected
         otherCause (5)         - Other initialization failure reason

   o  Xdsl2OperationModes:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify an ADSL mode, which
      is a category associated with each transmission mode defined for
      the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ link.  Part of the line
      configuration profile depends on the ADSL Mode:

      Specified as an enumeration construct, there are currently a few
      dozen transmission modes in the list.

   o  Xdsl2PowerMngState:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify each power
      management state defined for the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ link.
      For VDSL2 links only L0 and L3 states are supported:

         l0(1)       - L0 - Full power management state
         l1(2)       - L1 - Low power management state (for G.992.2)
         l2(3)       - L2 - Low power management state (for G.992.3,
                       G.992.4, and G.992.5)

         l3(4)       - L3 - Idle power management state

   o  Xdsl2ConfPmsForce:

      Attributes with this syntax are configuration parameters that
      reference the desired power management state for the VDSL2/ADSL/
      ADSL2 or ADSL2+ link.  For VDSL2 links only L0 and L3 states are
      supported:

         l3toL0 (0)       - Perform a transition from L3 to L0 (Full
                            power management state)
         l0toL2 (2)       - Perform a transition from L0 to L2 (Low
                            power management state)
         l0orL2toL3 (3)   - Perform a transition into L3 (Idle power
                            management state)

   o  Xdsl2LinePmMode:

      Attributes with this syntax are configuration parameters that
      reference the power modes/states into which the xTU-C or xTU-R may
      autonomously transit.

      This is a BITS structure that allows control of the following
      transit options:

         allowTransitionsToIdle (0)    - xTU may autonomously transit
                                         to idle (L3) state.
         allowTransitionsToLowPower (1)- xTU may autonomously transit
                                         to low-power (L1/L2) state.

2.6.  Line Topology

   A VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ Line consists of two units: atuc or
   vtuc (a central office termination unit) and atur or vtur (a remote
   termination unit).  There are up to 4 channels (maximum number of
   channels depends on the specific DSL technology), each carrying an
   independent information flow, as shown in the figure below.

2.7.  Counters, Interval Buckets, and Thresholds

2.7.1.  Counters Managed

   There are various types of counters specified in this MIB.  Each
   counter refers either to the whole VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ line, to
   one of the xtu entities, or to one of the bearer channels.

   o  On the whole line level

      For full initializations, failed full initializations, short
      initializations, and for failed short initializations there are
      event counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history
      bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30
      previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each current 15- minute
      "failed" event bucket has an associated threshold notification.

   o  On the xtu level

      For the LOS Seconds, ES, SES, FEC seconds, and UAS, there are
      event counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history
      bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30
      previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each current 15- minute event
      bucket has an associated threshold notification.






Morgenstern, et al.      Expires August 29, 2007               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


   o  On the bearer channel level

      For the coding violations (CRC anomalies) and corrected blocks
      (i.e., FEC events) there are event counters, current 15- minute
      and 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval- counters",
      as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day interval-
      counter(s).  Each current 15-minute event bucket has an associated
      threshold notification.

2.7.2.  Minimum Number Of Buckets

   Although it is possible to support up to 96 15-minute history buckets
   of "interval-counters", systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   practically support at least 16 buckets, as specified in ITU-T
   G.997.1, paragraph #7.2.7.9.

   Similarly, it is possible to support up to 30 previous 1-day
   "interval-counters", but systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   support at least 1 previous day buckets.

2.7.3.  Interval Buckets Initialization

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a 15-minute interval and any wall clock;
   however, some implementations may align the 15-minute intervals with
   quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
   day intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when an xtU is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB module).

2.7.4.  Interval Buckets Validity

   As in RFC 3593 [RFC3593] and RFC 2662 [RFC2662], in case the data for
   an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST report
   the interval as invalid.  If the current 15-minute event bucket is
   determined to be invalid, the element management system SHOULD ignore
   its content and the agent MUST NOT generate notifications based upon
   the value of the event bucket.

   A valid 15-minute event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for
   exactly 15 minutes.  Similarly, a valid 1-day event bucket SHOULD
   usually count the events for exactly 24 hours.  However, the
   following scenarios are exceptional:






Morgenstern, et al.      Expires August 29, 2007               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


   1) For implementations that align the 15- minute intervals with
      quarter hours, and the 1-day intervals with start of a day, the
      management system may still start the PM process not aligned with
      the wall clock.  Such a management system may wish to retrieve
      even partial information for the first event buckets, rather than
      declaring them all as invalid.
   2) For an event bucket that suffered relatively short outages, the
      management system may wish to retrieve the available PM outcomes,
      rather than declaring the whole event bucket as invalid.  This is
      more important for 1-day event buckets.
   3) An event bucket may be shorter or longer than the formal duration
      if a clock adjustment was performed during the interval.

   This MIB allows supporting the exceptional scenarios described above
   by reporting the actual Monitoring Time of a monitoring interval.
   This parameter is relevant only for Valid intervals, but is useful
   for these exceptional scenarios:
   a) The management system MAY still declare a partial PM interval as
      Valid and report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted.
   b) If the interval was shortened or extended due to clock
      corrections, the management system SHOULD report the actual number
      of seconds the interval lasted, beside reporting that the interval
      is Valid.

2.8.  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of xtUs, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every
   xtU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned
   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the
   provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of profiles and
   templates.

   A configuration profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by
   multiple entities.  There are configuration profiles to address the
   line level provisioning and another type of profile that addresses
   the channel level provisioning parameters.

   A configuration template is actually a profile-of- profiles.  That
   is, a template is comprised of one line configuration profile and one
   or more channel configuration profiles.  A template provides the
   complete configuration of a line.  The same configuration can be
   shared by multiple lines.

   Similarly to the configuration profiles and templates, this MIB
   module makes use of templates and profiles for specifying the alarm
   thresholds associated with performance parameters.  This allows
   provisioning multiple lines with the same criteria for generating

   threshold crossing notifications.

   The following paragraphs describe templates and profiles used in this
   MIB module

2.8.1.  Configuration Profiles And Templates

   o  Line Configuration Profiles - Line configuration profiles contain
      parameters for configuring the low layer of VDLS2/ADSL/ADSL2 and
      ADSL2+ lines.  They are defined in the xdsl2LineConfProfTable.

      The line configuration includes issues such as the specific VDSL2/
      ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ modes to enable on the respective line, power
      spectrum parameters, rate adaptation criteria, and SNR margin
      related parameters.  A subset of the line configuration parameters
      depends upon the specific xDSL Mode allowed (i.e., Does the
      profile allow VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2 and/or ADSL2+?) as well as what
      annex/annexes of the standard are allowed.  This is the reason a
      line profile MUST include one or more mode-specific extensions.

   o  Channel Configuration Profiles - Channel configuration profiles
      contain parameters for configuring bearer channels over the VDSL2/
      ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines.  They are sometimes considered as the
      service layer configuration of the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+
      lines.  They are defined in the xdsl2ChConfProfTable.

      The channel configuration includes issues such as the desired
      minimum and maximum rate on each traffic flow direction and
      impulse noise protection parameters.

   o  Line Configuration Templates - Line configuration templates allow
      combining line configuration profiles and channel configuration
      profiles to a comprehensive configuration of the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2
      and ADSL2+ line.  They are defined in the
      xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable.

      The line configuration template includes one index (OID) of a line
      configuration profile and one to four indexes of channel
      configuration profiles.  The template also addresses the issue of
      distributing the excess available data rate on each traffic flow
      direction (i.e., the data rate left after each channel is
      allocated a data rate to satisfy its minimum requested data rate)
      among the various channels.

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


2.8.2.  Alarm Configuration Profiles And Templates
   o  Line Alarm Configuration Profiles - Line level Alarm configuration
      profiles contain the threshold values for Performance Monitoring
      (PM) parameters, counted either on the whole line level or on an
      xtu level.  Thresholds are required only for failures and
      anomalies.  E.g., there are thresholds for failed initializations
      and LOS seconds, but not for the aggregate number of full
      initializations.  These profiles are defined in the
      xdsl2LineAlarmConfProfileTable.

   o  Channel Alarm Configuration Profiles - Channel level Alarm
      configuration profiles contain the threshold values for PM
      parameters counted on a bearer channel level.  Thresholds are
      defined for two types of anomalies: corrected blocks and coding
      violations.  These profiles are defined in the
      xdsl2ChAlarmConfProfileTable.

   o  Line Alarm Configuration Templates - Line Alarm configuration
      templates allow combining line level alarm configuration profiles
      and channel level alarm configuration profiles to a comprehensive
      configuration of the PM thresholds for VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+
      line.  They are defined in the xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable.

      The line alarm configuration template includes one index (OID) of
      a line level alarm configuration profile and one to four indexes
      of channel level alarm configuration profiles.

2.8.3.  Managing Profiles And Templates

   The index value for each profile and template is a locally-unique,
   administratively assigned name having the textual convention
   'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   configuration template (e.g., xdsl2LConfTempTemplateName = 'silver')
   by setting its xdsl2LineCnfgTemplate objects to the value of this
   template.

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   Alarm configuration template (e.g., xdsl2LAlarmConfTempTemplateName =
   'silver') by setting its xdsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate objects to the
   value of this template.

   Before a template can be deleted or taken out of service it MUST be
   first unreferenced from all associated lines.  Implementations MAY
   also reject template modification while it is associated with any
   line.

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


   Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service it MUST be
   first unreferenced from all associated templates.  Implementations
   MAY also reject profile modification while it is referenced by any
   template.

   Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL'
   for each profile and template type.  The values of the associated
   parameters will be vendor-specific unless otherwise indicated in this
   document.  Before a line's templates have been set, these templates
   will be automatically used by setting xdsl2LineCnfgTemplate and
   xdsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This
   default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context
   of profiles and templates defined in this MIB module.

   Profiles and templates are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically
   using the profile name and profile row status in each of the profile
   tables.

   If the implementation allows modifying a profile or template while it
   is associated with a line, then such changes MUST take effect
   immediately.  These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or
   soft restart) of the units on the line.

2.8.4.  Managing Multiple Bearer Channels

   The number of bearer channels is configured by setting the template
   attributes xdsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile,
   xdsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, and
   xdsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile and then assigning that template to a
   DSL line using the xdsl2LineCnfgTemplate attribute.  When the number
   of bearer channels for a DSL line changes, the SNMP agent will
   automatically create or destroy rows in channel-related tables
   associated with that line.  For example, when a DSL line is operating
   with one bearer channel, there will be zero rows in channel- related
   tables for channels two, three, and four.  The SNMP agent MUST create
   and destroy channel related rows as follows :

   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      higher number, the SNMP agent will automatically create rows in
      the xdsl2ChannelStatusTable, and xdsl2PMChCurrTable tables for
      that line.
   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      lower number, the SNMP agent will automatically destroy rows in
      the xdsl2ChannelStatusTable,
      xdsl2PMChCurrTable,xdsl2PMChHist15MinTable and
      xdsl2PMChHist1DTable tables for that line.

2.9.  Notifications

   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart
   (per [RFC3418]), which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber
   Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/
   linkDown (per [RFC2863]), which are per interface (i.e., VDSL2/ADSL/
   ADSL2 or ADSL2+ line) is required.

   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC
   Anomaly, LOS, LOF, or UAS event occurs.  The corresponding linkUp
   notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are
   cleared.

   The notifications defined in this MIB module are for status change
   (e.g., initialization failure) and for the threshold crossings
   associated with the following events: Full initialization failures,
   short initialization failures, ES, SES, FEC Seconds, LOS Seconds,
   UAS, FEC Seconds, FEC events, and CRC anomalies.  Each threshold has
   its own enable/threshold value.  When that value is 0, the
   notification is disabled.

   The xdsl2LineStatusXtur and xdsl2LineStatusXtuc are bitmasks
   representing all outstanding error conditions associated with the
   AtuR and xtuc (respectively).  Note that since the xtur status is
   obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable in case the
   xtur is unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
   Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current
   status.  Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in those two
   status objects are defined.

   Note that there are other status parameters that refer to the AtuR
   (e.g., downstream line attenuation).  Those parameters also depend on
   the availability of EOC between the central office xtu and the remote
   xtu.

   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the
   threshold value.  Only one notification SHOULD be sent per interval
   per interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter is reset to 0
   every 15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification may
   recur as often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a
   notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once
   every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent
   will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.

   Notifications, other than the threshold notifications listed above,
   SHOULD be rate limited (throttled) such that there is an
   implementation-specific gap between the generation of consecutive



Morgenstern, et al.      Expires August 29, 2007               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


   notifications of the same event.  When notifications are rate
   limited, they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future
   time.  This is intended to be a general rate-limiting statement for
   notifications that otherwise have no explicit rate limiting
   assertions in this document.

   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via
   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).  At the beginning of the next 15
   minute interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes by
   and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which
   equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.

           1   - The default/generic PSD configuration.  Default
                 configuration will be used when no other matching
                 mode specific configuration can be found.
           2   - ADSL family. The attributes included in the Mode-
                 Specific PSD Configuration are irrelevant for

   DESCRIPTION
        "
         This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
         module for use with network management protocols in the
         Internet community for the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL,
         ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

         The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] defines
         objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL)
         interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
         These object descriptions are based upon the specifications
         for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined
         in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1E1.413
         [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)
         G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

         The MIB module described in RFC 4706 [RFC4706] defines
         objects used for managing ADSL2 interfaces per [G.992.3]
         and [G.992.4], and ADSL2+ interfaces per [G.992.5]. That MIB
         is also capable of managing ADSL interfaces per [T1E1.413],
         [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].

         This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and
         RFC 4706 [RFC4706], but rather provides a more comprehensive
         management model that manages VDSL2 interfaces per G.993.2
         [G.993.2] as well as ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies
         per T1E1.413, G.992.1, G.992.2, G.992.3, G.992.4, and
         G.992.5
         ([T1E1.413], [G.992.1], [G.992.2], [G.992.3], [G.992.4], and
         [G.992.5] respectively).

        Additionally, the management framework for VDSL2 lines

        (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR-129].  That
        framework is based on ITU-T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1].

        The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
        transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863
        [RFC2863]) section of this document.

      one or more frequency bands. Each band is represented by
      start and stop subcarrier indices with a subcarrier
      spacing of 4.3125kHz. The valid range of subcarrier indices
      run from 0 to at least the index of the highest allowed
      subcarrier in both transmission directions among all
      profiles enabled by the parameter xdsl2LConfProfProfiles.
      Up to 32 bands may be specified. Other subcarriers shall

      the subset of downstream PSD mask breakpoints, as specified
      in xdsl2LConfProfPsdMaskDs (PSDMASKds), that shall be used to
      notch an RFI band. This subset consists of couples of consecutive
      subcarrier indices belonging to breakpoints: [ti; ti + 1],
      corresponding to the low level of the notch. The specific
      interpolation around
      these points is defined in the relevant Recommendations
      (e.g., ITU-T Rec. G.992.5). The CO-MIB shall define the RFI
      notches using breakpoints in xdsl2LConfProfPsdMaskDs (PSDMASKds)
      as specified in the relevant Recommendations (e.g., ITU-T Rec.
      G.992.5).

      For ITU-T Rec. G.993.2, this configuration parameter defines the
      bands where the PSD shall be reduced as specified in
      #7.2.1.2/G.993.2. Each band shall be represented by a start and
      stop subcarrier indices with a subcarrier spacing
      of 4.3125 kHz. Up to 16 bands may be specified. This parameter
      defines the RFI bands for both upstream and downstream
      directions."

      When a parent 'mandatory row' is created in
      xdsl2LineConfProfModeSpecTable, the SNMP agent will automatically
      create several 'mandatory' rows in this table--one for
      each upstream band:
      Note: A mandatory row is one where xdsl2LConfProfXdslMode =
      defMode(1). When the parent row is deleted, the SNMP agent will
      automatically delete all associated rows in this table. Any
      attempt to delete a 'mandatory' row using the
      xdsl2LConfProfModeSpecBandUsRowStatus attribute will be rejected
      by the SNMP agent. The manager only MAY create a new 'optional'
      row in this table using the xdsl2LConfProfModeSpecBandUsRowStatus
      attribute if the associated parent optional row exists, and
      the value of xdsl2LConfProfXdslMode is a G.993.2 value. The
      manager MAY delete an 'optional' row in this table using the
      xdsl2LConfProfModeSpecBandUsRowStatus attribute at any time.

      With respect to xdsl2LConfProfUpboPsdA and xdsl2LConfProfUpboPsdB
      parameters, for a given upstreamn band, if an optional row
      is missing from this table, then that means upstream power back-
      off is disabled for that upstream band.

      Entries in this table MUST be maintained in a
      persistent manner."

4.  Implementation Analysis

   A management application intended to manage ADSL links (e.g.,
   G.992.1) with this MIB module MUST be modified to adapt itself to
   certain differences between RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and this MIB module,
   including the following aspects:

   o  Though the configuration templates/profiles allow referring to 1-4
      bearer channels, ADSL links are limited to 2 channels at most
   o  Though the channel configuration profile allows higher data rates,
      ADSL links are limited to downstream/upstream data rate as assumed
      in RFC 2662 [RFC2662]
   o  The Impulse Noise Protection (INP) configuration parameters are
      given by minimum protection and maximum delay parameters.
   o  The line configuration profile includes a sub-table that addresses
      mode-specific parameters.  For ADSL links, the management
      application SHOULD create a row in that table for the 'adsl' mode.
   o  The line configuration profile includes parameters that are
      irrelevant for ADSL links.  Similarly, many status parameters in
      the MIB are irrelevant for certain ADSL modes.  Therefore, it is
      advised to consult with ITU G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] regarding
      the scope and relevance of each parameter in this MIB.



5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non- secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                February 2007


   o  xdsl2LineTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  xdsl2LineCnfgTemplate
      *  xdsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate
      *  xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf
      *  xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsf
      *  xdsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCnfgTemplate could have a major
      adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate could have a
      contrary effect on notifications.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf could have an
      adverse affect on the power consumption of a line and may disrupt
      an operational service.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsf could cause an
      unscheduled line test to be carried out on the line.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart could cause
      an unscheduled cold reset to the line.

   o  xdsl2SCStatusTable

      This table contains one object, xdsl2SCStatusRowStatus, that
      supports SET operations.  Unauthorized changes could result in
      line test results being deleted prematurely.

      Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a
      notification being suppressed or deferred.  Setting a threshold to
      0 could result in a notification being suppressed.  Suppressing or
      deferring a notification could prevent the timely delivery of
      important diagnostic information.  Decreasing any of the threshold
      values could result in a notification being sent from the network
      falsely reporting a threshold crossing.

      Changing a threshold value could also have an impact on the amount
      of notifications the agent sends.  The Notifications Section of
      this document has a paragraph which provides general guidance on
      the rate limiting of notifications.  Agent implementations not
      providing rate limiting could result in notifications being
      generated at an uncontrolled rate.  Unauthorized changes to a
      threshold value could result in an undesired notification rate.

      Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted line
      alarm profiles being created or brought into service.  Also,

      profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  xdsl2LineInventoryTable

      Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain
      information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the
      network.  Further, such information is considered sensitive in

      *  xdsl2LInvVersionNumber

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   It is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
   security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure
   that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module
   is properly configured to give access only to those objects whose
   principals (users) have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
