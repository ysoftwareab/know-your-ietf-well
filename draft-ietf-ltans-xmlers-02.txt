Abstract 

   In many scenarios, users must be able to demonstrate the (time) 
   existence, integrity and validity of data including signed data for 
   long or undetermined period of time. This document specifies XML 
   syntax and processing rules for creating evidence for long-term non-
   repudiation of existence of data. ERS-XML incorporates alternative 
   syntax and processing rules to ASN.1 ERS syntax by using XML 
   language.

1. Introduction 

   The purpose of the document is to define XML Schema and processing 
   rules for Evidence Record Syntax in XML format. Document is related 
   to initial ASN.1 syntax for Evidence Record Syntax. 

1.1. Motivation 

   The evolution of electronic commerce and electronic data exchange in 
   general requires introduction of non-repudiable proof of data 
   existence as well as data integrity and authenticity. Such data and 
   non-repudiable proof of existence must endure for long periods of 
   time, even when information to prove data existence and integrity 
   weakens or ceases to exist. Mechanisms such as digital signatures do 
   not provide absolute reliability on a long term basis. Algorithms and 
   cryptographic material used to create a signature can become weak in 
   course of time and information needed to validate digital signatures 
   may became compromised or simply cease to exist due to for example 
   decomposing certificate service provider. Providing a stable 
   environment for electronic data on a long term basis requires the 
   introduction of additional means to continually provide an 
   appropriate level of trust in evidence on data existence, integrity 
   and authenticity. 

   All integrity and authenticity related techniques used today suffer 
   from the same problem of time related reliability degradation 
   including techniques for time stamping, which are generally 
   recognized as data existence proofs. Over long periods of time 
   algorithms used may become weak or encryption keys compromised. Some 
   of the problems might not even be technically related like 
   decomposing time stamping authority. To create a stable environment 
   where proof of existence and integrity can endure well into the 
   future a new technical approach must be used.

Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

   Long term non-repudiation of data existence and demonstration of data 
   integrity techniques have been already introduced for example by long 
   term signature syntaxes like [RFC3126]. Long term signature syntaxes 
   address mostly the long term endurance of digital signatures, while 
   evidence record syntax broadens this approach for data of any type or 
   format. 

   The XMLERS syntax is based on Evidence Record Syntax as defined in 
   [RFC4998] and is addressing the same problem of long term non-
   repudiable proof of data existence and demonstration of data 
   integrity on long term basis. XMLERS does not supplement the ERS 
   syntax. It introduces the same approach but in a different format. 

   The use of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format is already 
   recognized by a wide range of applications and services and is being 
   selected as the de-facto standard for many applications based on data 
   exchange. The introduction of evidence record syntax in XML format 
   broadens the horizon of XML use and presents a harmonized syntax with 
   a growing community of XML based standards. 

   Due to the differences in XML processing rules and other 
   characteristics of XML language, XMLERS does not present a direct 
   transformation of ERS in ASN.1 syntax. The XMLERS syntax is based on 
   different processing rules as defined in [RFC4998] and it does not 
   support for example import of ASN.1 values in XML tags. Creating 
   evidence records in XML syntax must follow the steps as defined in 
   this draft. XMLERS is a standalone draft and is based on [RFC4998] 
   conceptually only. 

   Evidence Record Syntax in XML format is based on long term archive 
   service requirements as defined in [RFC4810]. XMLERS syntax delivers 
   the same (level of) non-repudiable proof of data existence as ASN.1 
   ERS. The XML syntax supports archive data grouping (and de-grouping) 
   together with simple or complex time stamp renewal process. Evidence 
   records can be embedded in the data itself or stored separately as a 
   standalone XML file.

1.2. General Overview and Requirements 

   ERSXML draft (draft-ietf-ltans-xmlers-02) specifies XML syntax and 
   processing rules for creating evidence for long-term non-repudiation 
   of existence of data in a unit called "Evidence Record". The XMLERS 
   syntax is defined to meet the requirements for data structures as set 
   out in [RFC4810]. This document also refers to ASN.1 ERS 
   specification as defined in [RFC4998]. 

   An Evidence Record may be generated and maintained for a single data 
   object or a group of data objects that form an archive object. Data 
   object (binary chunk or a file) may represent any kind of document or 
   part of it. Dependencies among data objects, their validation or any 
   other relationship than "a data object is a part of particular 
   archived object" are out of the scope of this draft. 

   Evidence Record maintains a close relationship to time stamping 
   techniques. However, timestamps as defined in [RFC3161], can cover 
   only a single unit of data and do not provide processing rules for 
   maintaining a long term stability of timestamps applied over a data 
   object. Evidence for an archive object is created by acquiring a 
   timestamp from a trustworthy authority for a specific value that is 
   unambiguously related to a single or more data objects. The Evidence 
   Record syntax enables processing of several archive objects within a 
   single processing pass and by acquiring only one timestamp protects 
   all archive objects. 

   Besides a timestamp other artifacts are also preserved in an Evidence 
   Record: data necessary to verify the relationship between a time-
   stamped value and a specific data object, packed into a structure 
   called a "hash-tree"; and long term proofs for the formal 
   verification of included timestamp(s). 

   Due to the fact that digest algorithms or cryptographic methods used 
   may become weak or that certificates used within a timestamp (and 
   signed data) may be revoked or expired, the collected evidence data

Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

   must be monitored and renewed before such event occurs. Procedures 
   for the generation and renewing of such evidences are already 
   specified within the [RFC4998], but they depend on defined ASN.1 data 
   structures. For the purpose of renewal of the evidence, digest values 
   of ASN.1 formatted data must be calculated and used in further 
   processing. Beside replacing an ASN.1 scheme with an XML scheme, this 
   document also introduces XML based procedures and processing rules 
   for the creation and renewal of evidence data. 

1.3. Terminology 

   Archive data object: Data unit that is archived and has to be 
   preserved for a long time by the Long-term Archive Service. 

   Archive data object group: A multitude of (archive) data objects, 
   which for some reason (logically) belong together, e.g. a document 
   file and a signature file could be an archive data object group, 
   which represent signed data. 

   Archive Timestamp (ATS): An Archive Timestamp contains a time-stamp 
   token, useful data for validation and potentially a list of hash 
   values. The basic idea is to time-stamp a specific value, constructed 
   from significant values (e.g. hash value of a list of hash values of 
   documents), which are unambiguously related to the protected data 
   objects. 

   Archive Timestamp Chain (ATSC): holds a sequence of Archive 
   Timestamps generated during the preservation period. 

   Archive Timestamp Sequence (ATSSeq): is a sequence of Archive 
   Timestamp Chains. 

   Canonicalization: Processing rules for transforming an XML document 
   into its canonical form. Two XML document may have different physical 
   representations, but they may have the same canonical form. For

Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

   example a sort order of attributes does not change the meaning of the 
   document as defined in [XMLC14N]. 

   Cryptographic Information: Data or part of data related to the 
   validation process of signed data, e.g. digital certificates, digital 
   certificate chains, certificate revocation list, etc. 

   Digest Method: Digest method is an identifier for a digest algorithm, 
   which is a strong one-way function, for which it is computationally 
   infeasible to find an input that corresponds to a given output or to 
   find two different input values that correspond to the same output. 
   Digest algorithm transforms input data into a short value of fixed 
   length. The output is called digest value, hash value or data 
   fingerprint. 

   Evidence: Information that may be used to resolve a dispute about 
   various aspects of authenticity, validity and existence of archived 
   data objects. 

   Evidence record: Collection of evidence compiled for one or more 
   given archived data objects over time. An evidence record includes 
   ordered collection of ATS's, which are grouped into ATSC and ATSSeq.  

   Long-term Archive Service (LTA): A service responsible for 
   generation, collection and maintenance (renewal) of evidence data. A 
   LTA service may also preserve data for long periods of time, i.e. 
   storage of archived data objects and evidence, etc. 

   Hash Tree: Collection of significant values of protected objects 
   (input objects and generated evidence within archival period). For 
   that purpose a Merkle Hash Tree [MER1980] may be constructed and 
   reduced for each archive object. 

   Reduced hash-tree: The process of reducing a Merkle hash-tree 
   [MER1980] to a list of lists of hash values. This is the basis of 
   storing the evidence for a single data object.

   Timestamp (TS): A cryptographically secure confirmation generated by 
   a Time Stamping Authority (TSA) [RFC3161] specifies a structure for 
   timestamps and a protocol for communicating with a Timestamp 
   Authority. Besides this, other data structures and protocols may also 
   be appropriate, such as defined in [ISO-18014-1.2002], [ISO-18014-
   2.2002], [ISO-18014-3.2004], and [ANSI.X9-95.2005]. 

   According to the [RFC4998] specification an Archive Timestamp relates 
   to a data object, if the hash value of this data object is part of 
   the first hash value list of the Archive Timestamp. An Archive 
   Timestamp relates to a data object group, if it relates to every data 
   object of the group and no other data objects. 

1.4. Conventions Used in This Document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. Evidence Record 

   An Evidence Record is a unit of data, which is to be used to prove 
   the existence of an archived object (a single data object or a group 
   of data objects) at a certain time. It is possible to store Evidence 
   Record separately from the archived object or to integrate it into 
   the data itself. 

   Evidence Record Syntax enables processing of several archive objects 
   (group processing) with a single process and by acquiring only one 
   timestamp to protect many archive objects, without a need to access 
   any other archive objects or their evidence records while 
   demonstrating the validity for a particular archive object from the 
   group. 

   The Evidence Record contains one or several Archive Time-Stamps 
   (ATS). An ATS contains a time-stamp token and possibly useful data 
 
 
Jerman Blazic, et. al. Expires November 6, 2008               [Page 10] 
    
Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

   for validation, like certificates, CRLs or OCSP responses and also 
   specific attributes such as service policies. Initially, an ATS is 
   acquired and later, before it expires or becomes invalid, a new ATS 
   is generated, which prolongs the validity of the archived object (of 
   its data objects together with all previously generated archive time-
   stamps). This process must continue during the desired archiving 
   period. 

2.1. Evidence Record Structure 

   In XML syntax the Evidence Record is represented by the 
   <EvidenceRecord> element, which has the following structure (where 
   "+" denotes one or more occurrences and "*" denotes zero or more 
   occurrences): 

   <EvidenceRecord> 
      <Version /> 
      <EncryptionInformation> 
         <EncryptionInformationType> 
         <EncryptionInformationValue> 
      </EncryptionInformation> * 
      <ArchiveTimeStampSequence> 
         <ArchiveTimeStampChain Order> 
            <DigestMethod /> + 
            <CanonicalizationMethod /> + 
            <ArchiveTimeStamp Order> 
               <HashTree /> * 
               <TimeStamp /> + 
               <CryptographicInformation /> * 
               <Attributes /> * 
            </ArchiveTimeStamp>) + 
         </ArchiveTimeStampChain> + 
      </ArchiveTimeStampSequence> + 
   </EvidenceRecord> 

   The XML tags have the following meanings: 
 
 
Jerman Blazic, et. al. Expires November 6, 2008               [Page 11] 
    
Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

     <Version> tag indicates the syntax version, for compatibility with 
     future revisions of this specification and to distinguish it from 
     earlier non-conformant or proprietary versions of the XMLERS. 
     Current version of the XMLERS syntax is 02. 

     <ArchiveTimeStampSequence> is a sequence of 
     <ArchiveTimeStampChain>. 

     <CanonicalizationMethod> is a required element that specifies the 
     canonicalization algorithm applied to the 
     <ArchiveTimeStampSequence> or <ArchiveTimeStamp> element prior to 
     performing digest value calculations. 

     <ArchiveTimeStampChain> holds a sequence of Archive Timestamps 
     generated during the preservation period. Details on Archive 
     Timestamp Chains and Archive Timestamp Sequences are described in 
     section 2.3. The sequences of Archive Timestamp Chains and Archive 
     Timestamps are ordered and the order must be indicated with "Order" 
     attribute of the <ArchiveTimeStampChain> and <ArchiveTimeStamp> 
     element. 

     <DigestMethod> tag identifies the digest algorithms used to 
     calculate digest values over the archival period within an archive 
     time-stamp chain from archive data object(s), archive time-stamps, 
     archive time-stamp sequence and within time-stamp token. 

     <HashTree> tag holds a value or a structure of a reduced hash 
     tree(s) described in section 2.3.2.  

     <TimeStamp> tag holds a time stamp token provided by the Time-
     Stamping Authority. 

     <CryptographicInformation> tag allows the storage of data needed in 
     the process of archive time stamp token validation, when such data 
     is not provided by the time stamp token itself (e.g. time stamp in 
     XML format). This could include possible Trust Anchors, 
 
 
Jerman Blazic, et. al. Expires November 6, 2008               [Page 12] 
    
Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

     certificates, revocation information or the current definition of 
     the suitability of cryptographic algorithms, past and present. 
     These items may be added based on the policy used. This data is 
     protected by successive time-stamps in the sequence of the time-
     stamps. 

     <Attributes> tag contains additional information that may be 
     provided by an LTA used for the renewal process. An example of 
     additional information may be processing (renewal) policies, which 
     are relevant for document(s) preservation and evidence validation 
     at a later stage. 

     <EncryptionInformation> tag holds information on cryptographic 
     algorithms and material used to encrypt archive data. This optional 
     information is needed to unambiguously re-encrypt data objects. 
     When omitted, data objects are not encrypted or non-repudiation 
     proof is not needed for the unencrypted data. 

2.2. Archive Timestamp Sequence and Archive Timestamp Chain Structure 

   <ArchiveTimeStampSequence> element contains an ordered sequence of 
   <ArchiveTimeStampChain> elements and <ArchiveTimeStampChain> element 
   an ordered sequence of <ArchiveTimeStamp> elements. Order is 
   indicated with the Order attribute. 

   The first <ArchiveTimeStampChain> element and its first 
   <ArchiveTimeStamp> are generated at the beginning of the archival 
   period, both having values of the Order attribute equal 1. 

   When this initial <ArchiveTimeStamp> must be renewed, a new 
   <ArchiveTimeStamp> is generated and depending on the generation 
   process, it is either placed: 

   o  as <ArchiveTimeStamp> element in the same <ArchiveTimeStampChain> 
      element (see Time-Stamp Renewal) or  

 
 
Jerman Blazic, et. al. Expires November 6, 2008               [Page 13] 
    
Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

   o  as the first element in the sequence (see Hash Tree Renewal)in a 
      newly created <ArchiveTimeStampChain> element.  

   The value of its Order attribute is increased by one, and also if a 
   new chain is created its Order attribute is increased by one relative 
   to the one in the previous chain. 

   Generally when a new ATS is created it is placed into the last ATSC 
   as the last child element with an increased Order value of 1 from the 
   preceding ATS or a new ATSC is created with increased Order value of 
   1 from the preceeding ATSC element and the new ATS with the Order 
   number 1 is placed as its first child element. 

   The ATS with the largest Order attribute value within the ATSC with 
   the largest Order attribute value is the latest ATS and must be valid 
   at the present time. 

2.2.1. Digest Method 

   Digest method is a required element that identifies the digest 
   algorithm used to digest the archive data object(s) and the 
   previously generated long-term evidence over the archival period. It 
   is specified at the level of the ATSC and indicates the digest 
   algorithm that MUST be used for all digest value calculations related 
   to the archive timestamps within this chain. 

   Digest algorithms used for evidence record correspond to the 
   algorithms used for time stamp token(s) within a single ATSC. When 
   algorithms used by TSA are changed (e.g. upgraded) a new ATSC must be 
   started using new digest algorithm. New hash values used for new ATSC 
   must be obtained both, for archive data object(s) and for previous 
   ATSCs (see detailed description in section 3.2. ). 

   Within an archive time-stamp chain, depending on the case involved, 
   following digest value(s) are calculated:

   1. digest value(s) of archived data object(s) at the beginning of the 
      archival period or when performing hash-tree renewal 

   2. digest value(s) of previous ATS(s) when performing timestamp 
      renewal 

   3. digest value(s) of previous ATSC(s) when performing hash tree 
      renewal 

   For cases 2) and 3) calculation of the digest value of an XML element 
   is needed. Before performing digest value calculation of an XML 
   element, a proper binary representation must be extracted from its 
   (abstract) XML data presentation. The binary representation is 
   determined by UTF-8 encoding and canonicalization of the XML element. 
   The XML element includes the entire text of the start and end tags as 
   well as all descendant markup and character data (i.e., the text and 
   sub-elements) between those tags. 

2.3. Archive Timestamp Structure 

   The process of construction of an ATS must unambiguously bind the 
   archived object and the time-stamped value and thus prove that the 
   archived object existed and was identical, at the time of the 
   timestamp, to the currently present archived object (at the time of 
   verification). 

   Therefore an ATS is a collection of the time-stamp token, an optional 
   structure (a hash tree) for digest values of objects that were 
   protected with that time-stamp token and optional structures 
   (cryptographic information) that store additional data needed for 
   formal verification of the time-stamp token, such as certificate 
   chain or certificate revocation list. 

   For the initial ATS the value to be time-stamped must be 
   unambiguously related to the archived object (to all of its data 
   objects). When the same digest algorithm is used with the successive

   time-stamps (in the renewal process), it is enough that the time-
   stamped value is related only to the digest value of the last 
   (previous) ATS. When a different digest algorithm is used in the 
   renewal process, the time-stamped value must be unambiguously related 
   to the archive object and all previously created ATSCs. Renewal 
   process is described in detail in section 3.2. . 

2.3.1. Time-Stamp Token 

   Time-Stamp is an attestation generated by a TSA that a data item 
   existed at a certain time. For example, [RFC3161] specifies a 
   structure for signed time-stamp tokens in ASN.1 format. The following 
   structure example (reference to the Entrust XML Schema for time-
   stamp) is a digital signature compliant to XMLDsig specification 
   containing time-stamp specific data, such as time-stamped value and 
   time within <Object> element of a signature. 

   <element name="TimeStampInfo"> 
      <complexType> 
         <sequence> 
            <element ref="ts:Policy" />  
            <element ref="ts:Digest" />

         </sequence> 
      </complexType> 
   </element> 

2.3.2. Hash Tree 

   The time-stamping service may be, for a large number of archived 
   objects, expensive and time-demanding, so the LTA may profit from

   acquiring one time-stamp for many archived objects, which are not 
   otherwise related to each other. For that purpose a Merkle Hash Tree 
   [MER1980] may be constructed and reduced for each archive object. 

   Hash tree structure is a container for significant values, needed to 
   unambiguously relate a time-stamped value to protected data objects, 
   and is represented by the <HashTree> element. 

   The lists of digest values are generated by reduction of an ordered 
   Merkle hash-tree. The leaves of this hash-tree are the digest values 
   of the data objects to be time-stamped. Every inner node of the tree 
   contains one digest value, which is generated by digesting the binary 
   sorted concatenation of the children nodes (leaves). The root digest 
   value, which represents unambiguously all data objects, is time-
   stamped. 

   Note that there are no restrictions to the quantity of hash value 
   lists and of their length. Also note that it is profitable but not 
   required to build hash-trees and reduce them. An Archive Time-Stamp 
   may consist only of one list of hash-values and a time-stamp or in 
   the extreme case, only a time-stamp with no hash value lists.

   </Sequence> 

   This sample represents a reduced hash tree. The first sequence (input 
   list) contains 6 digest values, which indicate 6 hash values of data 
   objects to be archived with archive time-stamp element. Sequences 
   that follow the input list are used to calculate the final digest 
   value to be time-stamped. The reduced tree is result of reducing a 
   Merkle hash-tree as described in chapter 2.3.3. The digest values are 
   always represented as encoded base64 character data. 

2.3.3. Merkle Hash-Tree 

   A hash tree is a tree of digest values in which the leaves are hashes 
   of data blocks in, for instance, a file or set of files. Nodes 
   further up in the tree are the hashes of their respective children. 
   At the top of a hash tree is the root hash value. 

   From Merkle Hash-Tree for each leaf a very small sub tree may be 
   extracted (a reduced tree), that holds enough information to 
   unambiguously bind the leaf value with the root hash value. After the 
   group processing of several archive objects (ie the calculation of 
   the root hash value, that unambiguously binds together all archive 
   objects, was time-stamped), for each archive object a reduced tree is 
   saved within its evidence record (ie a hash tree within the last 
   ATS).

2.3.3.1. Generation of a Merkle Hash-Tree for a Group of Archive Objects 

   The Merkle Hash-Tree for a group of archive objects is built from 
   bottom to the root. First are collected the leaves of the tree. The 
   leaves are digest values of archive objects: 

   1. Collect archive objects and for each archive object its 
      corresponding data objects. 

   2. Calculate hash values of the archive objects and put them into 
      input list as follows: a digest value of an archive object is the 
      digest value of its data object, if there is only one data object; 
      for more than one data object a digest value is the digest value 
      of binary sorted, concatenated digest values of all its containing 
      data objects. Note that for some hash values on the input list 
      (archive objects having more than one data object) also lists of 
      their sub-hash values are stored.  

   3. Group together items in the input list by N (to make binary tree 
      in pairs) and for each group: binary ascending sort, concatenate 
      and calculate hash values with algorithm H. The result is a new 
      input list. 

   4. Repeat step 3, until only one hash value is left; this is the root 
      value of the hash tree to be time-stamped. 

   Example: The input list with 18 hashes, where the h'1 is generated 
   for a group of data objects (d4, d5, d6 and d7) and has been grouped 
   by 3. The group could be of any size (2, 3...). It is also possible 
   to extend the tree with "dummy" values; to make every node having the 
   same number of children.

2.3.3.2. Generation of the Reduced Hash Tree for an Archive Object 

   The following procedure describes generation of the reduced hash tree 
   for an archive object: 

   1. For a selected archive object generate the first sequence of the 
      reduced tree, which contains the list of hash values of the data 
      objects contained in the archive object (one or more). Select the 
      node with the hash value of the archive object. 

   2. Select all neighboring nodes, which have the same parent as 
      currently selected node and add their hash values as a new 
      sequence to the reduced tree. Select its parent node. 

   3. Repeat step 2 until the root is reached. Note that parent nodes 
      are not saved in the list as they are computable. 

   Reduced Hash tree for data group (from the previous example, 
   presented in Figure 1):

      < DigestValue >h9</ DigestValue > 
   </Sequence>

   </Sequence> 
   <Sequence> 
      < DigestValue >h'''2</ DigestValue > 
   </Sequence> 

2.3.3.3. Calculation of the root hash value from a reduced hash tree 

   The following procedure describes generation of the root hash value 
   from a reduced hash tree: 

   1. Take the first sequence from a reduced hash tree, sort hash items, 
      concatenate them and calculate a hash value with algorithm H (the 
      one used for creation of the hash tree). 

   2. Remove this sequence from the reduced hash tree. 

   3. If a reduced hash tree is not empty, add previously calculated 
      hash value to the first sequence and go to step 1. If a reduced 
      hash tree is empty, then the last calculated hash value is the 
      root hash value. 

2.3.4. Cryptographic Information 

   Digital certificates, CRLs or OCSP-Responses needed to verify the 
   time-stamp token should be stored in the time-stamp token itself. 
   When this is not possible, such data may be stored in 
   <CryptographicInformation> element (as a node value of its <Content> 
   element). 

   The attribute Type is optional and is used to store processing 
   information about type of stored cryptographic information.

3. Generation of an Evidence Record 

   The generation of an <EvidenceRecord> element can be described as 
   follows: 

   1. Select an archive object (an archive data object or an archive 
      data object group) to archive. 

   2. Create the initial ATS. This is the first ATS within the initial 
      Archive Time-Stamp Chain of the Archive Time-Stamp Sequence. 

   3. Refresh the Archive Time-Stamp when necessary, by Time-Stamp 
      Renewal or Hash-Tree Renewal. 

   In the case that only essential parts of documents or objects shall 
   be protected, the application not defined in this draft must ensure 
   that the correct extraction of binary data is made for generation of 
   evidence record. 

   For example: an application may provide also evidence such as 
   certificates, revocation lists etc., needed to verify and validate 
   signed data objects. This evidence may be added to the archived group 
   of data object and will be protected within initial (and successive) 
   time-stamp(s).  

   Comment [AJB]: For the purpose of extraction, inclusion of reference 
   tag should be defined, i.e. information on which data or piece of 
   data is digested. 

3.1. Initial Archive Timestamp 

   Initial ATS relates to a data object or a data object group that 
   represents an archived object. The generation of the initial ATS 
   elements can be done in a single process pass for one or for many 
   archived objects, described as follows: 

 
 
Jerman Blazic, et. al. Expires November 6, 2008               [Page 23] 
    
Internet-Draft                  XMLERS                         May 2008 
    

   1. Collect one or more archived objects to be time-stamped. 

   2. Select a valid digest algorithm H. The same digest algorithm MUST 
      be used to create the time-stamped values and the time-stamp. 

   3. Create an input list of digest values of archive objects 
      calculated with H (one digest value for each archived data 
      object). Those digest values are the leaves of the hash tree for 
      the whole group of archived objects. 

      A hash tree to be included within the initial ATS of a single 
      archived object is generated as a reduced hash tree from the hash 
      tree for the whole group as defined in 2.3.3. Hash tree may be 
      omitted in the initial archive time-stamp, when an archive object 
      is having a single data object; then the time-stamped value must 
      match the digest value of that single data object. When an archive 
      object is composed of more than one data object, place digest 
      values of all data objects in a group, sort them in binary 
      ascending order, concatenate them into a single string and 
      generate a new digest value. This digest value represents a digest 
      value of that archived object. The list of digest values of data 
      objects must be part of the first sequence in the hash tree 
      (reduced hash tree) for this archive object. 

   4. If there is more than one digest value on the input list, place 
      them in groups and sort each group in binary ascending order. 
      Concatenate group digest values and generate new digest values, 
      which represent inner nodes of the hash tree for the whole group. 
      Repeat this step until there is only one hash value left, which is 
      the root node value of the hash tree. 

   5. Acquire time-stamp for root node value. If the time-stamp is 
      valid, the initial archive time-stamp may be generated.

3.2. Renewal Process 

   Before the cryptographic algorithms used within the last Archive 
   Time-Stamp become weak or the time-stamp certificates are 
   invalidated, the existence of Archive Time-Stamp or archive time-
   stamped data has to be reassured. This can be done by creating a new 
   archive time-stamp. Depending on whether the time-stamp becomes 
   invalid or the hash algorithm of the hash tree becomes weak, two 
   kinds of renewal processes are possible. 

   If the digest algorithm to be used (H) in the renewal process is the 
   same as one used in the last Archive Time-Stamp (H'), the digest 
   value of that Archive Time-Stamp is calculated and a new Archive 
   Time-Stamp is applied. This process is known simply as time-stamp 
   renewal. 

   The process of hash tree renewal occurs when the new digest algorithm 
   is (due to new cryptographic constrains) different than the one used 
   in the last Archive Time-Stamp (H <> H'). In this case new Archive 
   Time-stamp Chain is created and a digest value for a new Archive 
   Time-Stamp is digested in the following manner from the binary 
   ascending sorted and concatenated: 

   o  digest values of data object(s) calculated with the new digest 
      algorithm and 

   o  digest value of all previously created Archive Time-Stamp Chains 
      calculated with the new digest algorithm (including ordered 
      archive timestamp chains and contained archive time stamps with 
      hash trees, cryptographic information, etc.). 

3.2.1. Time-Stamp Renewal 

   For the purpose of Time-Stamp Renewal, the complete content of the 
   <ArchiveTimeStamp> element of the preceding Archive Timestamp MUST be

   hashed and time stamped by a new Archive Time-Stamp. A digest value 
   to be time-stamped within a new ATS is calculated as follows: 

   1. If the current ATS does not contain needed proof for long-term 
      formal validation of its time-stamp token within the time-stamp 
      token, collect needed data such as root certificates, certificate 
      revocation lists, etc., and include them in 
      <CryptographicInformation> element of the last Archive Time-Stamp 
      (each data object into a separate <CryptographicInformation> 
      element). 

   2. Digest value is calculated from binary representation of the last 
      <ArchiveTimeStamp> element including added cryptographic 
      information. Acquire the time-stamp for the calculated digest 
      value. If the time-stamp is valid, the new archive time-stamp may 
      be generated. 

   3. Increase the value order of the new ATS by one and place the new 
      ATS into the last Archive Time-Stamp Chain. 

   The new ATS and its hash tree MUST use the same digest algorithm as 
   the preceding one, which is specified in the <DigestMethod> element 
   of the ATSC. 

3.2.2. Hash Tree Renewal 

   Hash tree renewal process is performed in cases where the used hash 
   algorithm becomes weak. This process takes into account values of all 
   preceding Archive Time-Stamps as well as values of archive data 
   objects (covered by Archive Time-Stamps). Hash tree renewal procedure 
   is as follows:

   1. If the current ATS does not contain needed proof for long-term 
      formal validation of its time-stamp token within the time-stamp 
      token, collect needed data such as root certificates, certificate 
      revocation lists, etc., and include them in 
      <CryptographicInformation> element of the last Archive Time-Stamp 
      (each data object into a separate <CryptographicInformation>). 

   2. Select a (new) secure hash algorithm H and select data objects 
      d(i) referred to by initial Archive Time-Stamp. Generate hash 
      values h(i) = H(d(i)). In case the initial Archive Time-Stamp is 
      applied to more than one data object (of archive data object), 
      then more than one hash values are generated i.e., h(i_a), 
      h(i_b).., h(i_n) 

   3. Calculate the digest value hatsc(i) = H(ATSC(i))of the 
      canonicalized binary representation of the previously generated 
      and ordered <ArchiveTimeStampChain> elements within 
      <ArchiveTimeStampSequence> element, corresponding to data object 
      d(i). Note that Archive Timestamp Chains and Archive Time Stamps 
      MUST be chronologically ordered, each respectively to its Order 
      attribute. 

   4. Concatenate and sort in binary ascending order: each h(i) and 
      corresponding H(ATSC(i))and generate a new digest value h(i)'. In 
      case of more data objects in one archive data object, concatenate 
      and sort in binary ascending order hash values h(i_a), h(i_b), 
      etc. and H(ATSC(i)). Build a new Archive Timestamp for each h(i)'. 
      Generation of the reduced hash tree (for h(i)' elements) is 
      defined in section 2.3.2. . Note that each h(i)' is treated as the 
      document hash in section 2.3.2. The first hash value list in the 
      reduced hash tree should only contain h(i)'. For a multi-document 
      group (data object group which contains more than one document), 
      the first hash value list contains the new hashes for all the 
      documents in this group in binary ascending order, i.e. h(i_a)', 
      h(i_b)', etc.

   5. Create new <ArchiveTimeStampChain>, and place it into the existing 
      <ArchiveTimeStampSequence> as a last child with the order number 
      increased by one. Create new <ArchiveTimeStamp> element with order 
      number 1 and place it into created <ArchiveTimeStampChain> 
      element. 

4. Verification of an Evidence Record 

   An Evidence Record shall prove that an archive object existed and has 
   not been changed from the time of the time-stamp token within the 
   first ATS. Every ATS, but the last, must be valid at the time of the 
   next ATS. In order to complete the non-repudiation proof for the data 
   objects, the last ATS has to be valid at the time when verification 
   is performed. 

   To verify the validity of an Evidence Record start with the first ATS 
   till the last ATS (ordered by attribute Order) and perform 
   verification for each ATS, as follows: 

   1. Select an archive data object or group of data objects 

   2. Re-encrypt data object or data object group, if 
      <EncrpytionInformation> field is used (see section 5.  for more 
      details) 

   3. Get a digest method identifier H from the <DigestMethod> element 
      of the current ATSC. 

   4. Make a list of digest values of (archive) data objects within 
      (archive) data object group that MUST be protected with this ATS 
      as follows: 

       a. If this ATS is the first in the ATSC chain:

           i. If this is the first ATS of the first ATSC in the ATSSeq 
               sequence, calculate digest values of data objects with H 
               and add each digest value to the list. 

          ii. If this is the first ATS of the ATSC which is not the 
               initial ATSC in the ATSSeq sequence, calculate a single 
               digest value with H of ordered ATSCs. Add and sort in 
               binary ascending order this digest value with digest 
               values of protected data objects and generate a new hash 
               value. 

       b. If this ATS is not the first in the ATSC chain: 

           i. Calculate the digest value with H of the previous ATS 
               element. 

   5. Get the first sequence of the hash tree for this ATS. If this ATS 
      has no hash tree elements then: 

       a. If this ATS is not the first in the ATSSeq (first ATS of first 
          ATSC), exit with a negative result. 

       b. If this ATS is the first in the ATSSeq, there must be only one 
          protected data object. The digest value of that data object 
          must be the same as its time-stamped value. If not, exit with 
          a negative result. 

   6. If there is a digest value in the list of digest values of 
      protected objects, which can not be found in the first sequence of 
      the hash tree or if there is a hash value in the first sequence of 
      the hash tree which is not in the list of digest values of 
      protected objects, exit with a negative result. Get the hash tree 
      from the current ATS and use H to calculate the root hash value 
      (see section 2.3.3.3. )

   7. Get time stamped value from the time stamp token. If calculated 
      root hash value from the hash tree does not match the time stamped 
      value, exit with a negative result. 

   8. Verify timestamp cryptographically and formally (validate the used 
      certificate and its chain which may be available within the time 
      stamp token itself or <CryptographicInformation> tag). 

   9. If this ATS is the last ATS, check formal validity for the current 
      time (now), or get "valid from" time of the next ATS and verify 
      formal validity at that specific time. 

   10.If the needed information to verify formal validity is not found 
      within the timestamp or within its Cryptographic Information 
      section of ATS, exit with a negative result. 

5. Encryption 

   In some archive services scenarios it may be required that clients 
   send encrypted data only, preventing information disclosure to third 
   parties, such as archive service providers. In such scenarios it must 
   be clear that evidence records generated refer to encrypted data 
   objects. Evidence records in general protect the bit-stream which 
   freezes the bit structure at the time of archiving. Encryption 
   schemes in such scenarios cannot be changed afterwards without losing 
   the integrity proof. Therefore, an ERS record must hold and preserve 
   encryption information in a consistent manner. 

   Encryption is a two way process, whose result depends on the 
   cryptographic material used, e.g. encryption keys and encryption 
   algorithms. Encryption and decryption keys as well as algorithms must 
   match in order to reconstruct the original message or data that was 
   encrypted. When different cryptographic material is used, the results 
   however may not be the same, i.e. decrypted data does not match the 
   original (unencrypted) data. In cases when evidence was generated to 
   prove the existence of encrypted data the corresponding algorithm and

   decryption keys used for encryption have to be properly preserved 
   otherwise the evidence record is not a non-repudiation proof. To 
   achieve this, cryptographic material must become a part of the 
   evidence record and is used to unambiguously represent original 
   (unencrypted) data that was encrypted. 

   Cryptographic material may also be used in scenarios when a local 
   copy of encrypted data submitted to the LTA for preservation is kept 
   in an unencrypted form by a client. In such scenarios cryptographic 
   material is used to re-encrypt unencrypted data for the purpose of 
   performing validation of evidence record, which is related to the 
   encrypted form of client's data. 

   [AJB] This section may need rework (detailed definition of 
   cryptographic information element values). 

   The attribute Type within <EncrytionInformation> element is optional 
   and is used to store processing information about type of stored 
   encryption information, e.g. encryption algorithm or encryption key, 
   (while the element holds e.g. encryption key value).
