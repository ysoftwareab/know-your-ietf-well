1. The attachOverride Option

   Section 4.1 contains the APEX option registration for the
   "attachOverride" option.

   The default behavior of the APEX relaying mesh, in the absence of
   processing options, is to allow at most one application to attach as
   a particular endpoint, on a "first come, first served" basis.  The
   "attachOverride" option provides gives preference to the current
   application trying to attach.

   If this option is present in the "attach" operation (c.f., Section
   4.4.1 of [1]) and if any application is already attached as the
   specified endpoint, that endpoint has its attachment terminated
   (c.f., Section 4.4.3 of [1]) concurrently with processing of that
   "attach" operation.  The "code" attribute of the resulting
   "terminate" operation is set to 556.

   Note that any data being expected by the previously-attached
   application may instead be delivered to the last application to
   successfully attach.  Accordingly, applications should take care to
   properly deal with incoming data having unrecognized transaction-
   identifiers (c.f., Section 6.1.1 of [1]).

   This option provides for a new attachment to automatically terminate
   any existing attachment for the same endpoint.  For example, This
   might be helpful when a new attachment is required from a different
   device while a previously-used device is still attached e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- attach -----> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |   #1  | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <attach endpoint='fred@example.com' transID='1' />
     S: <ok />










   ... some time later appl #2 starts on a different computer ...

2. The dataTiming Option

   Section 4.2 contains the APEX option registration for the
   "dataTiming" option.  This option contains a "dataTiming" element
   (c.f., Section 5).

   The default behavior of the APEX relaying mesh is "immediate, best
   effort" and expects that all relays and endpoints are able to process
   and transfer data without delay -- in the absence of processing
   options, if a relay is unavailable then data is silently dropped.
   The "dataTiming" option provides for controlled queuing delays in
   processing, whilst providing reasonable deterministic behavior for
   the originator.

   There are two types of delay addressed by the "dataTiming" option:

   o  delays in transit through the relaying mesh, possibly due to
      intermittent or slow connections, or congested relays; and,

   o  delays because the intended endpoint is not available to receive
      the data, when used in conjunction with the hold4Endpoint option
      (Section 3).

   Accordingly, the "dataTiming" option allows for:

   o  data to be discarded if not delivered within a finite amount of
      time as specified using the "noLaterThan" attribute (Section 2.1);

   o  a "statusResponse" message (c.f., Section 5.1 of [1]) to be
      generated if data is not delivered within a known amount of time
      as specified using the "reportAfter" attribute (Section 2.2); and,

   o  an upper limit on the amount of time for the "statusResponse"
      message to be delivered using the "returnTrip" attribute (Section
      2.1.1), after which the sender may presume the message to be lost.

   This option does not provide any functionality with respect to the
   priority of the data.  Nor does this option have any effect on other
   parts of the relaying process.

   Further, note that because this option is processed on a per-hop
   basis, the originator must set the "targetHop" attribute to the value
   "all" and the "mustUnderstand" attribute to the value "true".

2.1 Upper-Bounds on Delivery

   The "noLaterThan" attribute of the "dataTiming" option provides for
   control over delays that may occur in transit through the relaying
   mesh or to the recipient endpoint.

   If this option is present in the "data" operation (c.f., Section
   4.4.4 of [1]) and the value of the "noLaterThan" attribute is non-
   zero, then:

   o  For Step 5.2 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:

      Immediately prior to sending the data to the next relay, the value
      of the "noLaterThan" attribute is adjusted to reflect the
      processing time of the data at the local relay (e.g., the time
      required to determine the next relay, to successfully issue a
      "bind" operation, and then be ready to immediately issue a "data"
      operation).

      If the value of the "noLaterThan" attribute becomes less than or
      equal to zero, an error in processing has occurred, the data
      element is not sent to the next relay, and if the "reportErrors"
      attribute is true, the APEX report service is invoked to send a
      timing error report.

   o  For Step 5.3 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:

      If the relay does not receive an "ok" element from the recipient
      endpoint within the number of milli-seconds indicated by the value
      of the "noLaterThan" attribute, an error in processing has
      occurred, and if the "reportErrors" attribute is true, the APEX
      report service is invoked to send a timing error report.

      Otherwise, if the data is successfully transmitted to the
      recipient, and the "returnTrip" attribute is non-zero, the APEX
      report service is invoked to send a final hop report.

   Note that in some cases, a relay may be able to predict this outcome
   without actually connecting to the next relay; if so, a timing error
   report may be sent without connecting to the next relay.

2.1.1 Final Hop Report

   If the APEX report service (c.f., Section 6.2 of [1]) is invoked to
   send a final hop report, it issues a data operation with:

   o  its originator identifying the report service associated with the
      issuing relay

   o  its recipient identifying the endpoint address of the originator
      associated with the "dataTiming" option

   o  a new "dataTiming" option having:

      *  its "noLaterThan" attribute equal to the "returnTrip" attribute
         of the original "dataTiming" option

      *  and no other attributes present

   o  its content consisting of a "statusResponse" element having:

      *  its "transID" attribute equal to the "transID" attribute of the
         "dataTiming" option

      *  and identifying the original recipient with a permanent success
         indicator

2.2 Reporting on Delayed Delivery

   The "reportAfter" attribute of the "dataTiming" option provides for
   the originator to be notified if delivery is delayed beyond a
   specified time.  Delivery of the data is not affected.  Note that if
   the value of the "noLaterThan" attribute is non-zero, then it
   provides the operational upper-bounds for the "reportAfter"
   attribute.

   If this option is present in the "data" operation (c.f., Section
   4.4.4 of [1]) and the value of the "reportAfter" attribute is non-
   zero, then:

   o  For Step 5.2 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:

      Immediately prior to sending the data to the next relay, the value
      of the "reportAfter" attribute is adjusted to reflect the
      processing time of the data at the local relay (e.g., the time
      required to determine the next relay, to successfully issue a
      "bind" operation, and then be ready to immediately issue a "data"
      operation).

      If the value of the "reportAfter" attribute becomes less than or
      equal to zero, then its value is set to zero and the APEX report
      service is invoked to send a transient timing report; regardless,
      the data element is sent to the next relay.

   o  For Step 5.3 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:

      If the relay does not receive an "ok" element from the recipient
      endpoint within the number of milli-seconds indicated by the value
      of the "reportAfter" attribute, then its value is set to zero and
      the APEX report service is invoked to send a transient timing
      report.

2.2.1 Transient Timing Report

   If the APEX report service (c.f., Section 6.2 of [1]) is invoked to
   send a timing error report, it issues a data operation with:

   o  its originator identifying the report service associated with the
      issuing relay

   o  its recipient identifying the endpoint address of the originator
      associated with the "dataTiming" option

   o  its content consisting of a "statusResponse" element having:

      *  its "transID" attribute equal to the "transID" attribute of the
         "dataTiming" option

      *  and identifying the original recipient with a transient success
         indicator

3. The hold4Endpoint Option

   Section 4.3 contains the APEX option registration for the
   "hold4Endpoint" option.

   The default behavior of the APEX relaying mesh, in the absence of
   processing options, is to silently drop data for a recipient if its
   endpoint isn't attached.  The "hold4Endpoint" option provides for
   data to be queued if the recipient endpoint is not attached.

   If this option is present in the "data" operation (c.f., Section
   4.4.4 of [1]), and the value of the "hold4Endpoint" attribute is true
   then:

   o  For Step 5.3 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:

      If the recipient's endpoint is not currently attached, the relay
      will queue the data waiting for an application to attach as that
      endpoint.

   Note that in the absence of an upper-bounds on delivery, such as
   limits provided by the dataTiming option (Section 2), the data will
   be queued indefinitely for the endpoint.

   For example:

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |   #1  | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='cid:1@example.com'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='barney@example.com' />
            <option internal='hold4Endpoint' />
            <option internal='dataTiming' targetHop='all'
                    mustUnderstand='true' transID='86' />
                <dataTiming noLaterThan='60000' />
            </option>
        </data>
     S: <ok />





   ... some time later the recipient's endpoint attaches ...

6. Security Considerations

   Consult [1]'s Section 11 for a discussion of security issues.

   In addition:

   o  The dataTiming option (Section 2) may be used to expose private
      network topology.  Accordingly, an administrator may wish to
      choose to disable this option except at the ingress/egress points
      for its administrative domain.

   o  The hold4Endpoint option (Section 3) may be used to facilitate
      denial-of-service attacks.  Accordingly, an administrator may wish
      to impose administrative limits on this attribute (e.g., always
      require that the "dataTiming" option also be present with a short-
      lived "noLaterThan" attribute).
