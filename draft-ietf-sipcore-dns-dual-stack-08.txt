                  draft-ietf-sipcore-dns-dual-stack-08

Abstract

   RFC 3263 defines how a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   implementation, given a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), should
   locate the next-hop SIP server using Domain Name System (DNS)
   procedures.  As SIP networks increasingly transition from IPv4-only
   to dual-stack, a quality user experience must be ensured for dual-
   stack SIP implementations.  This document updates the DNS procedures
   described in RFC 3263 for dual-stack SIP implementations in
   preparation for forthcoming specifications for applying Happy
   Eyeballs principles to SIP.

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6        August 2016


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, [RFC3261]) and the additional
   documents that extended it provide support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
   However, this support does not fully extend to the highly hybridized
   environments that are characteristic of the transitional migratory
   phase from IPv4 to IPv6 networks.  During this phase, many server and
   client implementations run on dual-stack hosts.  In such
   environments, a dual-stack host will likely suffer greater connection
   delay, and by extension an inferior user experience, than an
   IPv4-only host.  The need to remedy this diminished performance of
   dual-stack hosts led to the development of the Happy Eyeballs
   [RFC6555] algorithm, which has since been implemented in many
   protocols and applications.

   This document updates the DNS lookup procedures of RFC 3263 [RFC3263]
   in preparation for the specification of the application of Happy
   Eyeballs to SIP.  Happy Eyeballs will provide enhanced performance,
   and consequently user experience, in highly hybridized dual-stack SIP
   networks.  The procedures described herein are such that a dual-stack
   client should look up both A and AAAA records in DNS and then select
   the best way to set up a network flow.  The details of how the latter
   is done is considered out of scope for this document.  See the Happy
   Eyeballs algorithm and implementation and design considerations in
   RFC 6555 [RFC6555] for more information about issues with setting up
   dual-stack network flows.

   Section 4 of this document clarifies the interaction of [RFC3263]
   with [RFC6157] and [RFC6724].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines additional terms used in this document
   that are specific to the SIP domain such as "proxy", "registrar",
   "redirect server", "user agent server" or "UAS", "user agent client"
   or "UAC", "back-to-back user agent" or "B2BUA", "dialog",
   "transaction", and "server transaction".

   This document uses the term "SIP server" that is defined to include
   the following SIP entities: user agent server, registrar, redirect
   server, a SIP proxy in the role of user agent server, and a B2BUA in
   the role of a user agent server.

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6        August 2016


   While this document focuses on the dual-stack situation described in
   RFC 6555 and other documents, concerning the migration from an
   IPv4-only network to a network supporting both IPv4 and IPv6, the
   techniques described can be used in other situations.  Possible
   situations include when a device has multiple interfaces with
   distinct addressing characteristics and when additional IP address
   families are created in the future.  This document uses the general
   term "dual-stack" to include all situations where the client has
   access to multiple communication methods that have distinct
   addressing characteristics.

   The term "address records" means the DNS records which translate a
   domain name into addresses within the address family(ies) that the
   entity supports (as A records provide IPv4 addresses and AAAA records
   provide IPv6 addresses), regardless of whether the address family was
   defined before or after this document was approved.

3.  DNS Procedures in a Dual-Stack Network

   This specification introduces two normative DNS lookup procedures.
   These are designed to improve the performance of dual-stack clients
   in IPv4/IPv6 networks.

3.1.  Dual-Stack SIP UA DNS Record Lookup Procedure

   Once the transport protocol has been determined, the procedure for
   discovering an IP address if the TARGET is not a numeric IP address
   but the port is explicitly stated in the URI, is detailed in
   Section 4.2 of RFC 3263 [RFC3263].  The piece relevant to this
   discussion is:

      If the TARGET was not a numeric IP address, but a port is present
      in the URI, the client performs an A or AAAA record lookup of the
      domain name.  The result will be a list of IP addresses, each of
      which can be contacted at the specific port from the URI and
      transport protocol determined previously.

   Section 4.2 of RFC 3263 [RFC3263] also goes on to describe the
   procedure for discovering an IP address if the TARGET is not a
   numeric IP address, and no port is present in the URI.  The piece
   relevant to to this discussion is:

      If no SRV records were found, the client performs an A or AAAA
      record lookup of the domain name.  The result will be a list of IP
      addresses, each of which can be contacted using the transport
      protocol determined previously, at the default port for that
      transport.  Processing then proceeds as described above for an
      explicit port once the A or AAAA records have been looked up.

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6        August 2016


   Happy Eyeballs [RFC6555] documents that looking up the "A or AAAA
   record" is not an effective practice for dual-stack clients and that
   it can add significant connection delay and greatly degrade user
   experience.  Therefore, this document makes the following normative
   addendum to the DNS lookup procedures of Section 4.2 of RFC 3263
   [RFC3263] for IPv4/IPv6 hybrid SIP networks and recommends it as a
   best practice for such dual-stack networks:

      The dual-stack client SHOULD look up address records for all
      address families that it supports for the domain name and add the
      resulting addresses to the list of IP addresses to be contacted.
      A client MUST be prepared for the existence of DNS resource
      records containing addresses in families that it does not support;
      if such records may be returned by the client's DNS queries, such
      records MUST be ignored as unusable and the supported addresses
      used as specified herein.

3.2.  Indicating Address Family Preference in DNS SRV Records

   The Happy Eyeballs algorithm [RFC6555] is particularly effective for
   dual-stack HTTP client applications that have significant performance
   differences between their IPv4 and IPv6 network paths.  This is
   because the client can initiate two TCP connections to the server,
   one using IPv4 and one using IPv6, and then use the connection which
   completes first.  This works properly because the client can test
   each route by initiating a TCP connection, but simply opening a TCP
   connection to an HTTP server does not change the server's state; the
   client will send the HTTP request on only one connection.

   Unfortunately, in common SIP situations, it is not possible to "race"
   simultaneous request attempts using two address families.  If the SIP
   requests are transmitted as single UDP packets, sending two copies of
   the request to two different addresses risks having two copies of the
   request propagating through the SIP network at the same time.  The
   difference between SIP and HTTP is that in SIP the sender cannot test
   a route in a non-state-changing way.

   (If two copies of the same request arrive at the destination client,
   the client MUST reject the second of them with a 482 "Merged Request"
   response.[RFC3261] But this rule is not sufficient to prevent user-
   visible differences in behavior.  A proxy that is upstream of the
   second request to arrive at the client may (almost immediately!)
   serially fork the second request to further destinations (e.g., the
   voicemail service for the destination client).)

   In this common scenario it is often necessary for a dual-stack client
   to indicate a preference for either IPv4 or IPv6.  A service may use
   DNS SRV records to indicate such a preference for an address family.

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6        August 2016


   This way, a server with a high-latency and/or low-capacity IPv4
   tunnel may indicate a preference for being contacted using IPv6.  A
   server that wishes to do this can use the lowest SRV priority to
   publish hostnames that only resolve in IPv6 and the next priority
   with host names that resolve in both address families.

   Note that hostnames that have addresses in only one address family
   are discouraged by [RFC6555].  Such special-purpose hostnames SHOULD
   be used only as described in this section, as targets of SRV records
   for an aggregate host name, where the aggregate host name ultimately
   resolves to addresses in all families supported by the client.

4.  Clarification of Interaction with RFC 6724

   Section 5 of [RFC6157] specifies that the addresses from the address
   records for a single target DNS name for a server's DNS name must be
   contacted in the order specified by the source and destination
   address selection algorithms defined in [RFC6724].  The set of
   addresses provided to a single invocation of the destination address
   selection algorithm MUST be the address records for the target DNS
   name in a single SRV record (or, if there are no SRV records, the DNS
   name in the URI or derived via NAPTR) -- the destination address
   selection algorithm MUST NOT reorder addresses derived from different
   SRV records.  Typically, desination address selection is done by
   using the (relatively new) getaddrinfo() function to translate the
   target DNS name into a list of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses in the
   order in which they are to be contacted, as that function implements
   [RFC6724].

   Thus, if SRV lookup on the server's DNS name is successful, the major
   ordering of the complete list of destination addresses is determined
   by the priority and weight fields of the SRV records (as specified in
   [RFC2782]) and the (minor) ordering among the destinations derived
   from the "target" field of a single SRV record is determined by
   [RFC6724].

   For example, consider a server with DNS name example.com, with TCP
   transport specified.  The relevant SRV records for example.com are:

      _sip._tcp.example.com.  300 IN SRV 10 1 5060 sip-1.example.com.
      _sip._tcp.example.com.  300 IN SRV 20 1 5060 sip-2.example.com.


   The processing of [RFC2782] results in this ordered list of target
   domain names:

      sip-1.example.com
      sip-2.example.com

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6        August 2016


   The address records for sip-1.example.com, as ordered by [RFC6724],
   are

      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:58:c02::face
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:c:a06::2:cafe
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:44:204::d1ce
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN A 192.0.2.45
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN A 203.0.113.109
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN A 198.51.100.24


   and the address records for sip-2.example.com, as ordered by
   [RFC6724], are:

      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:58:c02::dead
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:c:a06::2:beef
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:44:204::c0de
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN A 192.0.2.75
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN A 203.0.113.38
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN A 198.51.100.140


   Thus, the complete list of destination addresses has this ordering:

      2001:0db8:58:c02::face
      2001:0db8:c:a06::2:cafe
      2001:0db8:44:204::d1ce
      192.0.2.45
      203.0.113.109
      198.51.100.24
      2001:0db8:58:c02::dead
      2001:0db8:c:a06::2:beef
      2001:0db8:44:204::c0de
      192.0.2.75
      203.0.113.38
      198.51.100.140


   In particular, the destination addresses derived from sip-
   1.example.com and those derived from sip-2.example.com are not
   interleaved; [RFC6724] does not operate on the complete list.  This
   would be true even if the two SRV records had the same priority and
   were (randomly) ordered based on their weights, as the address
   records of two target DNS names are never interleaved.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces two new normative procedures to the existing
   DNS procedures used to locate SIP servers.  A client may contact
   additional target addresses for a URI beyond those prescribed in
   [RFC3263], and/or it may contact target addresses in a different
   order than prescribed in [RFC3263].  Neither of these changes
   introduce any new security considerations because it has always been
   assumed that a client desiring to send to a URI may contact any of
   its targets that are listed in DNS.

   The specific security vulnerabilities, attacks and threat models of
   the various protocols discussed in this document (SIP, DNS, SRV
   records, Happy Eyeballs requirements and algorithm, etc.) are well
   documented in their respective specifications.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions by IANA.

   Added explanation why "racing" simultaneous copies of a SIP requests
   causes incorrect behavior.  Acknowledged Spencer Dawkins for this.

   In Section 4, made explcit the ordered list of target domain names
   that result from processing the SRV records.  Acknowledged Suresh
   Krishnan for suggesting this.

   Updated the Terminology section to remove the definitions of
   "IPv4-only", etc. (which weren't being used) and add a definition of
   "dual-stack" that includes all multiple-stack situations.

      sipcore-dns-dual-stack-07

   Update per Ben Campbell's AD evaluation.

   Update Vijay Gurbani's affiliation.

   Update per Stefan Winter's OPS-DIR review.

8.3.  Changes from draft-ietf-sipcore-dns-dual-stack-05 to draft-ietf-
      sipcore-dns-dual-stack-06

   Acknowledged Adam Roach for providing the example in Section 4.

   Correct references to [RFC6157] vs. references to [RFC6724].

8.6.  Changes from draft-ietf-sipcore-dns-dual-stack-02 to draft-ietf-
      sipcore-dns-dual-stack-03

   Described the relationship to RFC 3263 as "update", since the
   existing wording in 3263 is not what we want.  Arguably, the new
   wording is what was intended in 3263, but the existing wording either
   does not say that or says it in a way that is easily misunderstood.

   Described the relationship to RFC 6157 as "clarification", since the
   described interaction between 3263 and 6157 appears to be the only
   reasonable interpretation.

   Revised wording, punctuation, and capitalization in various places.

   Clarified that this draft does not document Happy Eyeballs for SIP,
   but is preparatory for it.

   Attempted to use "update" for text that is definitively a change to
   the preexisting text and "clarify" for text that is a more clear
   statement of the (presumed) intention of the preexisting text.

   Removed normative words from section 1, the introduction.

   Copied definition of "address records" from RFC 2782 (SRV records) to
   allow the specifications to expand automatically to include any new
   address families.

   Relocated the text requiring a client to ignore addresses that it
   discovers in address families it does not support from section 4.2
   (which describes why the situation arises) to section 4.1 (which
   describes how clients look up RRs).

   Clarified the interaction with RFC 6157 (source and destination
