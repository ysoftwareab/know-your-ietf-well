2.  Introduction

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] is used to digitally
   sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt arbitrary message contents.
   This specification describes the use of the SHAKE128 and SHAKE256
   specified in [SHA3] as new hash functions in CMS.  In addition, it
   describes the use of these functions with the RSASSA-PSS signature
   algorithm [RFC8017] and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) [X9.62] with the CMS signed-data content type.

   The SHA-3 family of one-way hash functions is specified in [SHA3].
   In the SHA-3 family, two extendable-output functions (SHAKEs):
   SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, are defined.  Four other hash function
   instances, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 are also
   defined but are out of scope for this document.  A SHAKE is a
   variable length hash function.  The output length, in bits, of a
   SHAKE is defined by the d parameter.  The corresponding collision and
   second preimage resistance strengths for SHAKE128 are min(d/2,128)
   and min(d,128) bits respectively.  And, the corresponding collision
   and second preimage resistance strengths for SHAKE256 are
   min(d/2,256) and min(d,256) bits respectively.

   A SHAKE can be used in CMS as the message digest function (to hash
   the message to be signed) in RSASSA-PSS and deterministic ECDSA,
   message authentication code and as the mask generating function in
   RSASSA-PSS.  In Section 3 of this document we define six new OIDs
   using SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 in CMS.

2.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Identifiers

   The object identifiers for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 hash functions are
   defined in [shake-nist-oids] and we include them here for
   convenience.

          nistAlgorithm(4) 2 18 }

   In this specification, when using the id-shake128-len or id-
   shake256-len algorithm identifiers, the parameters MUST be absent.
   That is, the identifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, the
   OID.

   The parameters for id-KmacWithSHAKE128 and id-KmacWithSHAKE256 MUST
   be absent.  That is, each identifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one
   component, the OID.

   Section 4.1, Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.4 specify the
   required output length for each use of SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 in
   message digests, RSASSA-PSS, determinstic ECDSA and KMAC.

4.  Use in CMS

4.1.  Message Digests

   The id-shake128-len and id-shake256-len OIDs (Section 3) can be used
   as the digest algorithm identifiers located in the SignedData,
   SignerInfo, DigestedData, and the AuthenticatedData digestAlgorithm
   fields in CMS [RFC5652].  The encoding MUST omit the parameters field
   and the output size, d, for the SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 message digest
   MUST be 256 or 512 bits respectively.

   The digest values are located in the DigestedData field and the
   Message Digest authenticated attribute included in the
   signedAttributes of the SignedData signerInfo.  In addition, digest
   values are input to signature algorithms.

4.2.  Signatures

   In CMS, signature algorithm identifiers are located in the SignerInfo
   signatureAlgorithm field of SignedData content type and
   countersignature attribute.  Signature values are located in the
   SignerInfo signature field of SignedData and countersignature.

   Conforming implementations that process RSASSA-PSS and deterministic
   ECDSA with SHAKE signatures when processing CMS data MUST recognize
   the corresponding OIDs specified in Section 3.

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                 October 2018


4.2.1.  RSASSA-PSS Signatures

   The RSASSA-PSS algorithm is defined in [RFC8017].  When id-RSASSA-
   PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256 specified in Section 3 is
   used, the encoding MUST omit the parameters field.  That is, the
   AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, id-RSASSA-
   PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256.

   The hash algorithm to hash a message being signed and the hash
   algorithm as the mask generation function "MGF(H, emLen - hLen - 1)"
   [RFC8017] used in RSASSA-PSS MUST be the same, SHAKE128 or SHAKE256
   respectively.  The output-length of the SHAKE which hashes the
   message SHALL be 32 or 64 bytes respectively.

   In RSASSA-PSS, a mask generation function takes an octet string of
   variable length and a desired output length as input, and outputs an
   octet string of the desired length.  In RSASSA-PSS with SHAKES, the
   SHAKEs MUST be used natively as the MGF, instead of the MGF1
   algorithm that uses the hash function in multiple iterations as
   specified in Section B.2.1 of [RFC8017].  In other words, the MGF is
   defined as

       SHAKE128(mgfSeed, maskLen)

   and

       SHA256(mgfSeed, maskLen)

   respectively for id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128 and id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256.
   The mgfSeed is the seed from which mask is generated, an octet
   string.  The maskLen for SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 being used as the MGF
   is (n - 264)/8 or (n - 520)/8 bytes respectively, where n is the RSA
   modulus in bits.  For example, when RSA modulus n is 2048, the output
   length of SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 as the MGF will be 223 or 191 bytes
   when id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256 is used
   respectively.

   The RSASSA-PSS saltLength MUST be 32 or 64 bytes respectively.
   Finally, the trailerField MUST be 1, which represents the trailer
   field with hexadecimal value 0xBC [RFC8017].

4.2.2.  Deterministic ECDSA Signatures

   The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is defined in
   [X9.62].  When the id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE128 or id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE256
   (specified in Section 3) algorithm identifier appears, the respective
   SHAKE function is used as the hash.  The encoding MUST omit the
   parameters field.  That is, the AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                 October 2018


   SEQUENCE of one component, the OID id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE128 or id-
   ecdsa-with-SHAKE256.

   For simplicity and compliance with the ECDSA standard specification,
   the output size of the hash function must be explicitly determined.
   The output size, d, for SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 used in ECDSA MUST be
   256 or 512 bits respectively.  The ECDSA message hash function is
   SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 respectively.

   Conforming implementations that generate ECDSA with SHAKE signatures
   in CMS MUST generate such signatures with a deterministicly
   generated, non-random k in accordance with all the requirements
   specified in [RFC6979].  They MAY also generate such signatures in
   accordance with all other recommendations in [X9.62] or [SEC1] if
   they have a stated policy that requires conformance to these
   standards.

   In Section 3.2 "Generation of k" of [RFC6979], HMAC is used to derive
   the deterministic k.  Conforming implementations that generate
   deterministic ECDSA with SHAKE signatures in X.509 MUST use KMAC with
   SHAKE128 or KMAC with SHAKE256 as specfied in [SP800-185] when
   SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 is used as the message hashing algorithm,
   respectively.  In this situation, KMAC with SHAKE128 and KMAC with
   SHAKE256 have 256-bit and 512-bit outputs respectively, and the
   optional customization bit string S is an empty string.

4.3.  Public Keys

   In CMS, the signer's public key algorithm identifiers are located in
   the OriginatorPublicKey's algorithm attribute.

   Conforming implementations MUST specify the algorithms explicitly by
   using the OIDs specified in Section 3 when encoding RSASSA-PSS and
   ECDSA with SHAKE public keys in CMS messages.  The conventions for
   RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA public keys algorithm identifiers are as
   specified in [RFC3279], [RFC4055] and [RFC5480] , but we include them
   below for convenience.

4.3.1.  RSASSA-PSS Public Keys

   [RFC3279] defines the following OID for RSA AlgorithmIdentifier in
   the SubjectPublicKeyInfo with NULL parameters.

     rsaEncryption OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { pkcs-1 1}

   Additionally, when the RSA private key owner wishes to limit the use
   of the public key exclusively to RSASSA-PSS, the AlgorithmIdentifier
   for RSASSA-PSS defined in Section 3 can be used as the algorithm

   attribute in the OriginatorPublicKey sequence.  The identifier
   parameters, as explained in Section 3, MUST be absent.  The RSASSA-
   PSS algorithm functions and output lengths are the same as defined in
   Section 4.2.1.

   Regardless of what public key algorithm identifier is used, the RSA
   public key, which is composed of a modulus and a public exponent,
   MUST be encoded using the RSAPublicKey type [RFC4055].  The output of
   this encoding is carried in the CMS publicKey bit string.

     RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
           modulus INTEGER, -- n
           publicExponent INTEGER  -- e
     }

4.3.2.  ECDSA Public Keys

   When id-ecdsa-with-shake128 or id-ecdsa-with-shake256 are used as the
   algorithm identitifier in the public key, the parameters, as
   explained in Section 3, MUST be absent.  The hash function and its
   output-length are the same as in Section 4.2.2.

   Additionally, the mandatory EC SubjectPublicKey is defined in
   Section 2.1.1 and its syntax in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].  We also
   include them here for convenience:

      id-ecPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
          iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) keyType(2) 1 }

      ECParameters ::= CHOICE {
          namedCurve         OBJECT IDENTIFIER
          -- implicitCurve   NULL
          -- specifiedCurve  SpecifiedECDomain
          }

   The ECParameters associated with the ECDSA public key in the signers
   certificate SHALL apply to the verification of the signature.

4.4.  Message Authentication Codes

   KMAC message authentication code (KMAC) is specified in [SP800-185].
   In CMS, KMAC algorithm identifiers are located in the
   AuthenticatedData macAlgorithm field.  The KMAC values are located in
   the AuthenticatedData mac field.

   When the id-KmacWithSHAKE128 or id-KmacWithSHAKE256 algorithm
   identifier is used as the KMAC algorithm identifier, the parameters
   field MUST be absent.

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                 October 2018


   Conforming implementations that process KMACs with the SHAKEs when
   processing CMS data MUST recognize these identifiers.

   When calculating the KMAC output, the variable N is 0xD2B282C2, S is
   an empty string, and L, the integer representing the requested output
   length in bits, is 256 or 512 for KmacWithSHAKE128 or
   KmacWithSHAKE256 respectively in this specification.

5.  IANA Considerations

   [ EDNOTE: Update here only if there are OID allocations by IANA. ]

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are one-way extensible-output functions.  Their
   output length depends on a required length of the consuming
   application.

   The SHAKEs are deterministic functions.  Like any other deterministic
   functions, executing each function with the same input multiple times
   will produce the same output.  Therefore, users should not expect
   unrelated outputs (with the same or different output lengths) from
   excuting a SHAKE function with the same input multiple times.  The
   shorter one of any 2 outputs produced from a SHAKE with the same
   input is a prefix of the longer one.  It is a similar situation as
   truncating a 512-bit output of SHA-512 by taking its 256 left-most
   bits.  These 256 left-most bits are a prefix of the 512-bit output.

   Implementations must protect the signer's private key.  Compromise of
   the signer's private key permits masquerade.

   When more than two parties share the same message-authentication key,
   data origin authentication is not provided.  Any party that knows the
   message-authentication key can compute a valid MAC, therefore the
   content could originate from any one of the parties.

   Implementations must randomly generate message-authentication keys
   and one-time values, such as the k value when generating a ECDSA
   signature.  In addition, the generation of public/private key pairs
   relies on random numbers.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number
   generators (PRNGs) to generate such cryptographic values can result
   in little or no security.  The generation of quality random numbers
   is difficult.  [RFC4086] offers important guidance in this area, and
   [SP800-90A] series provide acceptable PRNGs.

   Implementers should be aware that cryptographic algorithms may become
   weaker with time.  As new cryptanalysis techniques are developed and
   computing power increases, the work factor or time required to break
   a particular cryptographic algorithm may decrease.  Therefore,
   cryptographic algorithm implementations should be modular allowing
   new algorithms to be readily inserted.  That is, implementers should
   be prepared to regularly update the set of algorithms in their
   implementations.
