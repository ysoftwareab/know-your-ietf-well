Internet-Draft      ANI Options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6      February 2016


1.  Introduction

   Access network identification (ANI) of a network device has a range
   of applications.  For example the local mobility anchor in a Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain is able to provide access network and access
   operator specific handling or policing of the mobile node traffic
   using information about the access network to which the mobile node
   is attached.

   This document specifies Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4
   (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] options for access network identification that is
   added by Relay agent in the DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 messages towards the
   Server.  The scope of applicability for this option is between a DHCP
   relay agent and a mobile access gateway where the same operator
   typically operates both these functions

   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay agent aware of the
   access network and access operator add this information in the DHCP
   messages.  This information can be used to provide differentiated
   services and policing of traffic based on the access network to which
   a client is attached.  Examples of how this information can be used
   in mobile networks can be found in [RFC6757].


2.  Motivation

   Proxy mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] can be used for supporting network-based
   mobility management in various types of network deployments.  The
   network architectures, such as Service provider Wi-Fi access
   aggregation or, WLAN integrated mobile packet core are examples where
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a component of the overall architecture.  Some
   of these architectures require the ability of the local mobility
   anchor (LMA) [RFC5213] to provide differentiated services and
   policing of traffic to the mobile nodes based on the access network
   to which they are attached.  Policy systems in mobility architectures
   such as PCC [TS23203] and ANDSF [TS23402] in 3GPP system allow
   configuration of policy rules with conditions based on the access
   network information.  For example, the service treatment for the
   mobile node's traffic may be different when they are attached to a
   access network owned by the home operator than when owned by a
   roaming partner.  The service treatment can also be different based
   on the configured Service Set Identifiers (SSID) in case of IEEE
   802.11 based access networks.  Other examples of services include the
   operator's ability to apply tariff based on the location.

   The PMIPv6 extension as specified in [RFC6757] defines PMIPv6 options
   to carry access network identifiers in PMIPv6 signaling from Mobile

   Access Gateway (MAG) to LMA.  MAG can learn this information from
   DHCP options as inserted by DHCP Relay agent before MAG.  If MAG
   relays DHCP messages to LMA as specified in [RFC5844] this
   information can be inserted by MAG towards LMA in the forwarded DHCP
   messages.

   Figure 1, illustrates an example Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment.  In
   this example, the access network is IEEE 802.11 based access-network,
   the DHCP Relay Agent function is located on the access point (AP),
   and the DHCP Server function is located on the MAG.  The MAG delivers
   the information elements related to the access network to the LMA
   over Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  The MAG obtains these
   information elements from the DHCP Relay Agent as per this
   specification.  The informational elements related to the access
   network include the SSID of the used IEEE 802.11 network, the geo-
   location of the access-network to which the mobile node is attached,
   and the identity of the operator running the IEEE 802.11 access
   network infrastructure.

   (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] specifications.  DHCP message refers to both
   DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages throughout this document.

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following abbreviations:

   Service Set Identifier (SSID)

      Service Set Identifier (SSID) identifies the name of the IEEE
      802.11 network.  SSID differentiates from one network to the
      other.

   Operator-Identifier

      The Operator-Identifier is the Structure of Management Information
      (SMI) Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the IANA-
      maintained "Private Enterprise Numbers" registry [SMI].  It
      identifies the operator running the access-network where the
      client is attached.


4.  DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Option

   The Access Network Identifier carries information to identify the
   access network to which the client is attached.  This information
   includes access technology type, network identifier, and access-
   network operator identifiers.

   Relay agents that include Access Network Identifier information
   include one or more sub-options (see Section 4.1) in the Relay Agent
   Information option [RFC3046].

4.1.  DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Sub-options

   The access network identifier information will be defined in multiple
   sub-options, allocated from the DHCP Relay Agent Sub-Option Codes.

   ANI Sub-options: The ANI Sub-options consists of a sequence of Sub-
   Option Code, Length, and Value tuples for each sub-option, encoded in
   the following manner:


       SubOpt  Len     Sub-option Data
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+
      | code |   N  |  s1  |  s2  |  s3  |  s4  |      |  sN  |

   Network Name
      The name of the access network to which the mobile node is
      attached.  The encoding MUST be UTF-8 as described in [RFC3629].

      The type of the Network Name is dependent on the access technology
      to which the mobile node is attached.  For IEEE 802.11 based
      networks, the network name will be the SSID of the network.  For
      3GPP access based it is the PLMN Identifier of the access network
      and for 3GPP2 access, the Network Name is the Access Network
      Identifier[ANI].

      When encoding the PLMN Identifier, both the Mobile Network Code
      (MNC) [TS23003] and Mobile Country Code (MCC) [TS23003] MUST be 3
      digits.  If the MNC in use only has 2 digits, then it MUST be
      preceded with a '0'.

   Subopt Code
      <IANA-3>.

   Length
      The length of the Access-Point Name field.

   Access-Point Name
      The name of the access point (physical device name) to which the
      mobile node is attached.  This is the identifier that uniquely
      identifies the access point.  While Network Name (e.g., SSID)
      identifies the operator's access network, Access-Point Name
      identifies a specific network device in the network to which the
      mobile node is attached.  In some deployments, the Access-Point
      Name can be set to the string representation of the Media Access
      Control (MAC) address as specified in [RFC6991] mac-address string
      type of the device or some unique identifier that can be used by
      the policy systems in the operator network to unambiguously
      identify the device.  The encoding MUST be UTF-8 as described in
      [RFC3629].

   Option-Code
      OPTION_ANI_OPERATOR_REALM (<IANA-12>).

   Option-Len
      The length of the Operator Realm field.

   Operator-Realm
      The contents of this field is the same as the Operator-Realm field
      described in Section 4.4.2.


6.  Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCPv4 Relay Agents MAY include sub-options defined in section 4.2
   through 4.4 in the Relay Agent Information option as defined in
   [RFC3046] for providing information about the access network over
   which DHCP messages from the client is received.

   The DHCPv4 Relay Agent when including any of these sub-options in the
   DHCP message, DHCPv4 Network Name Sub-option (Section 4.3.1), DHCPv4
   Access-Point Name Sub-option (Section 4.3.2), DHCPv4 Access-Point
   BSSID Sub-option (Section 4.3.3), MUST include the DHCPv4 Access-
   Technology-Type Sub-option (Section 4.2)

   DHCPv6 Relay Agents MAY include options defined in Section 5 in
   Relay-forward message when forwarding any DHCPv6 message type from
   clients to the servers to provide information about the access
   network over which DHCPv6 messages from the client is received.

   The DHCPv6 Relay Agent when including any of these options in the
   DHCP message, DHCPv6 Network Name Option (Section 5.2.1), DHCPv6
   Access-Point Name Option (Section 5.2.2), DHCPv6 Access-Point BSSID
   Option (Section 5.2.3), MUST include the DHCPv6 Access-Technology-
   Type Option (Section 5.1)


7.  Server Behavior

   DHCPv4 base specification [RFC2131] requires that the DHCPv4 server
   ignore the DHCPv4 Access Network Identifier option if it does not
   understand the option.

   If the DHCPv4 server does not understand the received sub-option
   defined in sections 4.1 through 4.4 in the DHCPv4 Relay Agent
   Information option (82) it MUST ignore those sub-options only.  If
   DHCPv4 Server is able to process the DHCPv4 Access Network Identifier



Bhandari, et al.         Expires August 4, 2016                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      ANI Options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6      February 2016


   sub-options defined in sections 4.1 through 4.4 received in DHCPv4
   Relay Agent Information option, it MAY use this information obtained
   from the sub-option for address pool selection, or for policy
   decisions as per its configured policy.  This information obtained
   from the sub-option SHOULD NOT be stored unless it is absolutely
   needed, However, if it is stored, the information MUST be deleted as
   quickly as possible to eliminate any possibility of the information
   getting exposed to an intruder.

   If the received DHCPv4 message does not include DHCPv4 Access-
   Technology-Type Sub-option (Section 4.2), but if it includes any one
   of these other options, DHCPv4 Network Name Sub-option
   (Section 4.3.1), DHCPv4 Access-Point Name Sub-option (Section 4.3.2),
   or DHCPv4 Access-Point BSSID Sub-option (Section 4.3.3), then the
   DHCPv4 server MUST ignore the received DHCPv4 Access-Network-
   Identifier option and process the rest of the message as per the base
   DHCPv4 specifications

   DHCPv6 base specification [RFC3315] requires that the DHCPv6 server
   ignore the DHCPv6 Access-Network-Identifier option if it does not
   understand the option.

   If the DHCPv6 server receives the options defined in Section 5 and is
   configured to use the options defined in Section 5, it SHOULD look
   for the DHCPv6 Access Network identifier options in the Relay-forward
   message of the DHCPv6 relay agent(s) based on its configured policy.
   The server MAY use received ANI options for its address pool
   selection policy decisions as per its configured policy.  This
   information obtained from the options SHOULD NOT be stored unless it
   is absolutely needed, However, if it is stored, the information MUST
   be deleted as quickly as possible to eliminate any possibility of the
   information getting exposed to an intruder.

   If the received DHCPv6 message does not include DHCPv6 Access-
   Technology-Type Option (Section 5.1), but it includes any one of
   these other options, DHCPv6 Network Name Option (Section 5.2.1),
   DHCPv6 Access-Point Name Option (Section 5.2.2), or DHCPv6 Access-
   Point BSSID Option (Section 5.2.3), then the DHCPv6 server MUST
   ignore the received DHCPv6 Access-Network-Identifier option and
   process the rest of the message as per the base DHCPv6
   specifications.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign Sub-option codes for the following DHCPv4
   Sub-options from the "DHCP Relay Agent Sub-Option Codes" registry,

9.  Security Considerations

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and
   relay agent can discover access network information.

   [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] describe many of the threats in using DHCP.
   [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] each provide a solution, the Authentication
   Option for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 (respectively).  However, neither of



Bhandari, et al.         Expires August 4, 2016                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft      ANI Options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6      February 2016


   these options are in active use and therefore are not a viable
   mitigation option.  DHCP itself is inherently insecure and thus link-
   layer confidentiality and integrity protection SHOULD be employed to
   reduce the risk of disclosure and tampering.

   It is possible for a rogue DHCP relay agent to insert or overwrite
   with incorrect access network identifier options for malicious
   purposes.  A DHCP client can also pose as a rogue DHCP relay agent by
   sending incorrect access network identifier options.  While the
   introduction of fraudulent DHCP relay agent information options can
   be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these options unless
   the DHCP relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the
   authentication sub-option for DHCPv4 relay agent information option
   [RFC4030] SHOULD be deployed as well.  Administrators SHOULD
   configure DHCP servers that use this option to communicate with their
   relay agents using IPsec, as described in Section 21.1 of [RFC3315].

   The information elements that this draft is exposing is the client's
   access-network information.  These pertain to the access network to
   which the client is attached, such as Access Technology Type (Ex:
   WLAN, Ethernet...etc), Access Point Identity (Name, BSSID), Operator
   Id/Realm.  In deployments where this information cannot be secured
   using IPsec [RFC4301] or other security protocols, administrators
   SHOULD disable the capability specified in this document on the DHCP
   entities.
