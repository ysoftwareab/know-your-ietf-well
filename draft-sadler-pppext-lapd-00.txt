3. Motivation

   Work has been progressing in the Multi-protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) working group on the application of MPLS technology to non-
   packet switching networks.  Specifically, development of the
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling draft [1] has allowed for
   Optical, SONET/SDH, and spatial switching to be controlled using IP
   protocols.

   Three scenarios have been offered [2] for carrying signaling
   messages between GMPLS enabled devices.  They are as follows:

   o In-band: signaling messages are carried over a control-channel
        embedded in the transport link between peering GMPLS LSRs.

   o Out-of-band, in-fiber: signaling messages are carried over a
        control-channel embedded in the physical link but outside the
        transport link of the peering GMPLS LSRs.

   o Out-of-band, out-of-fiber: signaling messages are carried over a
        separate control network that is not embedded in the physical
        link.

   In the case of In-band signaling over SONET/SDH transport, two
   control-channels exist: the Line Data Communication Channel (LDCC)
   and the Section Data Communication Channel (SDCC).  These channels
   have previously been standardized by [3] and [4] to use LAP-D as the
   data link, and to use the methods defined in ISO 9577 for
   identifying the Network Layer Protocols operating over the link.

   However, unlike PPP, LAP-D does not allow for negotiation of Link or
   Network parameters.  This can lead to operational issues caused by
   inconsistent configuration of the two end points of the data link.
   Further, because the Maximum Transmission Unit size for LAP-D over
   the SONET DCC has been standardized as a "minimum of 512-bytes"
   neighboring systems that can support MTU sizes of larger than 512
   bytes are unable to use the larger frame sizes because they donÆt
   know the supported size of the other endpoint.  Consequently, it is
   valuable to be able to operate PPP [5] over LAP-D.

   Previously, the PPP working group defined how to operate PPP over
   LAP-B [6].  While this approach could be used as the basis for
   operating PPP over LAP-D, it is not consistent with the use of ISO
   9577 as required by [3] and [4].

   Since ISO 9577 is also used when operating over Frame Relay data
   links, this document is based on the methodology defined in RFC 1973
   [7].

4. Lower Layer Requirements

   LAP-D [8] is a framed bit-synchronous link layer based on HDLC [9].
   Since no additional framing or bit/byte-stuffing is necessary when
   encapsulating PPP in LAP-D frames, PPP will present an octet-
   oriented interface to LAP-D.

   The LAP-D data link MUST be full-duplex, and MUST provide an
   Unacknowledged Information Transport Service.

   The LAP-D data link MAY be operating over a point-to-point physical
   link or a point-to-multipoint physical link.  The LAP-D Service user
   is insulated from this detail as the delivered service appears as a
   point-to-point link.  As a result, LCP Link events are traceable to
   the status of the supporting LAP-D connection.

5. Data Link Layer

5.1 Basic Frame Format

   The LAP-D header defined in Q.921 [8] consists of a flag followed by
   an address and a control field.  The address field is subdivided
   into the Subnetwork Attachment Point Identifier (SAPI) and the
   Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI).  The TEI is used to identify a
   specific device located on a point-to-multipoint connection.
   Originally developed for addressing devices on a multidrop bus at
   the ISDN S/T reference point, this is not used when LAP-D is used in
   a point-to-point connection.  The SAPI is used to identify a
   specific application on that device.  SAPIs exist for ISDN call
   control (00), X.25 (16), and SONET management (62).

   As specified in ISO 9577 [10], the client of the Data Link Layer is
   identified by the Initial Protocol Identifier (IPI) which is located
   in the first byte of the Data Link Layer payload.  This field is
   identical to the NLPID field used in Frame Relay.  The IPI/NLPID for
   PPP is 0xCF.

   The resulting PPP in LAP-D PDU is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Flag (0x7e)  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    SAPI   |C|0|    TEI      |1|            Control            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   IPI (0xcf)  |         PPP Protocol          |   Data . . .
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              draft-sadler-pppext-lapd-00.txt         August 2001


   The fields are defined as follows:
        SAPI      Subnetwork Attachment Point Identifier
        C         Command/Response Field
        TEI       Terminal Endpoint Identifier
        Control   Control word
        IPI       Initial Protocol Identifier
        Protocol  PPP Protocol field

   LAP-D is a connection oriented protocol, with information frames
   (Control = I or Control = UI) only being transmitted after a LAP-D
   connection has been established with the remote endpoint.  Once the
   connection is established, LAP-D allows for two modes of service:
   Acknowledged Information Transport Service (AITS) and Unacknowledged
   Information Transport Service (UITS).

   When the LAP-D connection is successfully established, PPP MUST be
   given a Link-Up event to start LCP negotiation.  While PPP is
   designed to operate over unreliable connections, LAP-D UITS mode is
   optional according to Q.921.  As a result, PPP MUST negotiate LCP
   options utilizing AITS mode.

   A new LCP option is used to identify the mode of service to be used
   on the connection after completing the LCP phase. The resulting LCP
   option looks like:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | LCPOpt (0xXX) |     Length    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The length field is 2.  Presence of this option signifies that the
   system is capable of supporting UITS mode.

   If both endpoints are capable of UITS, then the link MUST start
   using UITS to carry PPP packets once LCP negotiation is complete.

   The LAP-D connection MAY allow for other LAP-D service users
   (identified by different IPI values) to utilize the same LAP-D
   connection.  Their use of UITS or AITS service is independent of
   whether PPP is using UITS or AITS mode.

5.2 Modification of the Basic Frame

   The Link Control Protocol can negotiate modifications to the basic
   frame structure. However, modified frames will need to be clearly
   distinguishable from standard frames.

   Address-and-Control-Field-Compression

   Because the Address and Control field values will not be the same
   from one LAP-D frame to the next, Address-and-Control-Field-
   Compression MUST NOT be negotiated.

6. In-Band Protocol Demultiplexing

   The PPP IPI (CF hex) easily distinguishes the PPP encapsulation from
   the other encapsulations allowed in [10].

   For those network-layer protocols which have no PPP Protocol
   assignment, or which have not yet been implemented under the PPP
   encapsulation, or which have not been successfully negotiated by a
   PPP NCP, another method of encapsulation defined under [10] SHOULD
   be used.

   On reception, the PPP Protocol field is examined. If this field is
   zero, it MUST be assumed that the packet is mis-formatted and the
   packet is to be discarded.

   Initial LCP packets contain the sequence cf-c0-21 following the
   header. When a LCP Configure-Request packet is received and
   recognized, the PPP link enters Link Establishment phase.

   Packets with other IPI values MAY be sent and received at the same
   time as PPP.  Processing of these packets MAY continue as long as
   the corresponding PPP NCP for the protocol has not been successfully
   established.

   Once PPP has entered the Network-Layer Protocol phase and
   successfully negotiated a particular NCP for a PPP Protocol, if a
   frame arrives using another equivalent data encapsulation defined in
   [10], the PPP Link MUST reset the state of the NCP and send a new
   NCP Configure-Request. This prevents "black-holes" that occur when
   the peer loses state.

   An implementation which requires PPP link configuration, and other
   PPP negotiated features (such as authentication), MAY enter
   Termination phase when configuration fails. Otherwise, when the
   Configure-Request sender reaches the Max-Configure limit, it MUST
   fall back to send only frames encapsulated according to other
   methods defined in [10].

7. Configuration Details

   The following Configuration Options are recommended:

   Magic Number

   The standard LCP configuration defaults apply to LAP-D links, except
   Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU).

   To ensure interoperability with existing LAP-D implementations, the
   initial MRU is 1600 octets [4]. This only affects the minimum
   required buffer space available for receiving packets, not the size
   of packets sent.


Sadler                 PPPEXT WG - August 2001                      5
              draft-sadler-pppext-lapd-00.txt         August 2001


   The typical network feeding the link is likely to have a MRU of
   1500, or greater. To avoid fragmentation, the Maximum-Transmission-
   Unit (MTU) at the network layer SHOULD NOT exceed 1500, unless a
   peer MRU of 2048 or greater is specifically negotiated.

   Some LAP-D implementations are only capable of 262 octet frames. It
   is not recommended that anyone deploy or use a LAP-D which is
   capable of less than 1600 octet frames. However, PPP implementations
   MUST be configurable to limit the size of LCP packets which are sent
   to 259 octets (which leaves room for the IPI and Protocol fields),
   until LCP negotiation is complete.

   Because the Address and Control fields are important to the proper
   operation of LAP-D, Address and Control Field Compression (ACFC)
   must not be negotiated.

8. Security Considerations

   This draft introduces no new security considerations.
