 Abstract


  This document provides the final clarification of the
  conclusions resulting in the expansion of 'RFC 1518 and 1519',
  which redefines the 'CIDR' notation as the 'Network Descriptor',
  and proves that the IP Address Pool of the IPtX Specification is
  greater than IPv6. In other words, IPtX is a more powerful and
  cost effective IP Addressing Specification, which allows the
  interface of the “Front-End” to mimic or simulate the IPv4
  Specification, a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address, in the Backbone
  environment of an unlimited size IP Address Space.


 Introduction

  The "CIDR" Concepts, the 'Network Descriptor' and the
  'Bit-Mapped' IP Address, provided the bases for the comparison
  between IPv4, IPv6, and the IPtX IP Addressing Specifications,
  which concluded that these are different expressions of equal
  definitions. That is, mathematically speaking, the IP Address
  Pools of the IPv4 and the IPv6 Specifications, mathematically
  defines the variable Coefficient of an Identical Base Pool of
  IP Addresses, or X(2^32); given that 'X' respectively equals
  '1' and '7.9228163 x 10^28'.

  Where IPv4 = 1(2^32)
  and IPv6 = 7.9228163 x 10^28(2^32) = 2^128 = (2^32)^4.


  However, the IP Address Pool for the IPtX Specification is
  mathematically defined by the equation:

             IPtX  = X(2^32) + 16,500,000.

  Nevertheless, these additional IP Addresses, because only the
  "Network Descriptors" are different, (approximately 16.5 Million
  Shared) are Host or Client IP Addresses, which cannot be used to
  establish a direct Internet Connection because of the Logic
  problems, the decisional conflicts with the Routers. In other
  words, the expansion of the 'CIDR' concept(s), which
  mathematically defines the expression; 'X(2^32)', can only
  provide a Bit-Map that uniquely Identifies every IP Address
  within every Address Class, or the IP Address Range the
  expression defines, essentially availing the entire Range of IP
  Addresses to the Global-Net.

 1. The Classless Inter-Domain Routing Architecture, or CIDR


  The Classless Inter-Domain Routing Architecture, or CIDR, was
  derived from the so called; "strategies for address assignment of
  the existing IP address space with a view to conserve the address
  space and stem the explosive growth of routing tables in default-
  route-free routers" [9]. It was in reality, an Expansion of the
  'Default Addressing Structures' existing in the Address Class
  System. The popular claim nevertheless, boasted the elimination of
  the Address Class System. These Claims needless to say, were
  fashioned by the Authors, whose works represented their personal
  interpretation(s), because the works comprising RFC's 1517, 1518,
  and 1519 were never fully understood. The truth nonetheless, was
  clearly explained in RFC 1519, whose discourse dealt specifically
  with the way the Routers, and the Routing Protocols interpreted,
  or dealt with the IP Address, and not the elimination of the
  Address Class System per se. In other words, the Routers and the
  Routing Protocols were limited to using only the 'Default
  Addressing Formats', which represented Class A, Class B, and the
  Class C Addressing Specification. And to deal with the prospect,
  or the possibility of an IP Addressing Shortage, a plan was
  devised (RFC's 1517, 1518, and 1519), which actually involved not
  only the initial 'Default Addressing Formats', from Class A, B,
  and C, but the remaining fractional subcomponents from each of
  their respective Octets as well. In fact, while RFC 1519
  specifically designed the CIDR Architecture to take advantage of
  Class C, it did not weaver in its mention of the same
  implementation for the Class A Specification. It could be said in
  other words, that the CIDR Architecture represents an Un-Finished
  version of the 'IPtX Protocol Family Specification'. However,
  because of the MISNOMER, 'CLASSLESS', the process of SUB-DIVIDING
  a Class (In particular; Class A, and Class C), was never fully
  understood. Hence, the CIDR Architecture is the Sub-division of a
  CLASS SYSTEM, or a Class Addressing System that has been
  SUB-DIVIDED, which represents the Class, or the Whole, having a
  Greater Number of Constituents.
  
  In other words, the CIDR Architecture actually represents; The
  'Inter-Domain IP Bit Mapped Address Routing Architecture'. Because
  this, in essence, is what is really happening to the IP Address,
  and this is the IP Addressing Format that the Router and the
  Routing Protocols are dealing with. Therefore, the Class Addressing
  System is a format that implements a Network IP Address using a
  specified number of BITs, and in this case, it is either '8', '16',
  '24', or '32' Bits. Needless to say, any further Sub-Division, or

  use of some Smaller Portion or Constituent, does not constitute a
  departure nor eliminate the Existence of the Address Class System.
  Hence, the CIDR Architecture actually reinforced the Class Concept
  and proved that, without changing the entire Addressing Architecture
  defining the 'IP Bit Mapped Address or the IP Bit Mapped Address
  Space', the Whole, is indeed the Sum of its Parts.




 2. The Interpretation of the conclusion's Expansion of 'CIDR';
     Defining the "Network Descriptor"


  When defining the New 'CIDR' Architecture as representing the
  collective Extension for RFC's 1517, 1518, and 1519, we must
  first list the functional components, or Highlights, noted as
  the objectives or purpose supporting each of these papers,
  individually. That is, there must be comparison between the
  definition or description of the functional purpose of the
  'CIDR' Architecture as represented in each of these papers,
  compared with the New 'CIDR' Architecture this paper actually
  represents.


RFC 1517 (Maintained promoted a fear of IP Address Loss, and
          Astronomical growth in the size of the Routing Tables):

"- Exhaustion of the class-B network address space. One
   fundamental cause of this problem is the lack of a network
   class of a size that is appropriate for a mid-sized
   organization. Class-C, with a maximum of 254 host addresses,
   is too small, while class-B, which allows up to 65534 addresses,
   is too large to be densely populated.  The result is inefficient
   utilization of class-B network numbers.

-  Routing information overload. The size and rate of growth of the
   routing tables in Internet routers is beyond the ability of
   current software (and people) to effectively manage.

-  Eventual exhaustion of IP network numbers."

Argument in Opposition (Justification of the New 'CIDR' Architecture):


  Clearly, using the expanded 'CIDR' Architecture, when using the
  'CIDR'Network Descriptor, the Reality of IP Address Exhaustion now
  defines a wasted use of IP Addresses. In other words, Viable IP
  Address that could have been use to establish an Internet Connection,
  Connecting the Network's Backbone-Domain to the Internet, were
  assigned for the Host IP Addresses. This is further clarified by a
  Comparison of the "Internet Protocol v4 Address Space, and the use
  of the CIDR Network Descriptor displayed in Table I:

RFC 1518 (Which deals more with the actual Structure of the Internet,
          or its Hierarchical Structure , and IP Address allocation
          and Routing, than the actual 'CIDR' Architecture) where by,
          the points are specified as:

     There are two aspects of interest when discussing IP address
     allocation within the Internet. The first is the set of
     administrative requirements for obtaining and allocating IP
     addresses; the second is the technical aspect of such
     assignments, having largely to do with routing, both within a
     routing domain (intra-domain routing) and between routing domains
     (inter-domain routing). This paper focuses on the technical
     issues.    

     The architecture and recommendations in this paper are oriented
     primarily toward the large-scale division of IP address
     allocation in the Internet.

Argument in Opposition (Justification of the New 'CIDR'
Architecture): 

  While there is a lot that can be said regarding RFC 1518,
  especially since this is a proposal which advocates a great
  deal of dependency upon ISP's, whose entire existence is
  based upon the Economy, the Consumer, and a Volatile Market.
  This actually means, an ISP has no guaranteed Future, regarding
  either the use of the IP Address Base, or their Routers for a
  thoroughfare. In other words, while this RFC did mention some
  good points, which are indeed supported in the IPtX
  Specification. It nevertheless, maintained more the soundings
  of a White Paper Solicitation for a New System Overall, than an
  actual presentation representing 'CIDR' Architecture. Needless
  to say, some of the problems discussed, and emphasized
  repeatedly, addressed the need for a Internet Hierarchy, while
  dismissing the need to expand the number of Backbone connections,
  which is the main point of consideration when addressing the
  concept of an Internet Hierarchy.

RFC 1519 (While this RFC should be the replacement for RFC 1517,
         because it is clearly derived from RFC 1517, it claims to
         Obsoletes RFC 1338, which I have not read. And while this
         paper also disputes some of the proposals outlined in RFC
         1518 {Noting Specifically the causes for a loss of
         aggregation efficiency; Organizations which are multi-homed,
         and Organizations which change service provider but do not
         renumber.}. Nevertheless, one thing this RFC does, that the
         others so far do not, is that, it Mathematically Introduces
         the beginnings of Foundation for the 'CIDR' Architecture.)
 

Argument in Opposition (Justification of the New 'CIDR' Architecture):

  Nonetheless, while this RFC introduces the basic Mathematical
  Foundation for the 'CIDR' Architecture, and sets the fundamentals
  for the hardware and software specifications for Networking in a
  Supernetted Environment, it actually does nothing to prevent IP
  Address wasted on Host Assignments. This is because the foundation
  of the 'CIDR' Architecture was derived from the IPv4 specification,
  which means there was no way, short of a New IP Addressing System,
  could this waste be avoided. However, this is not the problem with
  the IPtX specification, because it De-Emphasizes the HOST IP Address,
  and gives it secondary functional value, which defines a dummy Host.
  Needless to say, this was the foundation that was needed to get the
  'Ball Rolling'. Nevertheless, while RFC 1519 developed the
  Mathematical foundation for the 'CIDR' Architecture, it never fully
  Exploited the benefits this Architecture maintains.

                           Definitions


  CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing is an IP Address Resolution
        Technique that provides a way to resolve any Binary Number(s)
        into its the Integer Translation to verify an IP Address,
        which is writen in 'Dotted Notation' and defined by '4' 8 Bit
        Octets. 




  CIDR Network Descriptor: It is a 2 Part Number used to resolve,
                           or discover the Integer representing
                           Binary Number defining the Network
                           Bit-Mapped IP Address.

  [Where by, the Digits to the Right of the Colon Represents the
   Starting Point for the IP Address Class Range in Binary Notation,
   or Network IP Address assigned to the Specified IP Address Class
   Range. And the Digits to the Left of the Colon represent the Count
   of Bit Mapped Displacement, or the Number of Binary Digits the
   Network IP Address uses. In which case, the '/XXXX:XX' notation
   would be used to Identify the Bit-Mapped Address Class and the
   Address Class Range of a Network IP Address.] 








  Nevertheless, the definitions noted above, concludes the argument by
  providing logical support for Re-Defining the 'CIDR' notation as the
  "Network Descriptor", which comprises a Switch, and a 2-part Number
  that defines the entire Range of every IP Address, including the
  Address Class Range mapping every Octet for the Network portion of
  the IP Address defines.

 3.  The IPtX and IPv4 IP Addressing Schemes – 100% Compatibility 



  The IPtX IP Addressing Scheme is a logically derived 'Internet
  Protocol Addressing Family' that is founded upon the IPv4 IP
  Addressing Specification. In other words, because IPtX utilizes the
  same Bit-Mapped Binary Addressing Format, which does not require any
  deviation from the operational infrastructure of the IPv4 Address
  Space. It maintains a 100% Backward Compatibility with IPv4, which
  is retained throughout an expansion capability defining an
  Infinitely Bit-Mapped IP Address Space using only a 64 Bit Header.
  There is however, the one noted difference in the IPv4 and the IPtX
  Sppecifications, which defines a distinction between the respective
  "Subnet-Mask" and the "Subnet-Identifier" that allows the IPtX
  Address Pool to be greater than IPv4 and IPv6, when using the same
  Bit-Mapped IP Address Space. Needless to say, while this distinction
  might at first, appear to be a strong departure from the IPv4 Format.
  It’s only a 'Binary Switch' that uses the elements from the Set,
  {X,Y}, to provide the ability the Change ((between) or (Extend)) the
  'Programmed Functions' or 'Operations' defining the "Subnet-Mask"
  and the "Subnet-Identifier". In any case, it should be clearly
  understood, the definition of the "Subnet-Identifier" extends the
  definition of the "Subnet-Mask" by providing the ability to Change
  the Range of the Subnet, which specifies the range of the Host IP
  Address. And this, it should be noted, is the Distinguishing
  Mathematical Hallmark that assigns every IP Address in the IPv4
  Specification to the IP Address Pool, with the added benefit of the
  creation of a Host IP Address Pool. Now, if the Address Spaces were
  equal, the number of available IP Address in the IP Address Pool
  assigned to the IPv4 Specification, given that IPtX is defined as
  the extension of IPv4, exceeds the number of available IP Address
  in the IP Address Pool assigned to the IPv6 Specification.
  Nevertheless, the validity of the forgoing is supported by the
  conclusions from the mathematical analysis and comparison of Tables
  III, IV, and V.

  The mathematical analysis of the result from Table III and Table IV
  reveals that when the "Subnet-Mask" is equal to the "Subnet-
  Identifier". The division of the Address Classes in the IPv4
  Spreification, is defined by the "Network Descriptor" as; the
  Logical Expansion of each of the Address Classes in the IPv4
  Specification, through the use of the Network ID designation, "255",
  in remaining Octets. And because the requirement of the "Subnet-
  Mask" mandates that 'only a Number from the Range of the Address
  Class' can be assigned a Network ID, then every Octet specifies one
  of the '4 Sub-Division' created in the Range of every Address Class.
  In other words, because the "Subnet-Mask" specifies the uses of the
  "255" designation in conjunction with the 'Range of the Address
  Class', to identify the Address Class associated with the Network
  ID. The logical use of the Octets remaining in the Range of every
  Address Class in conjunction with the "Subnet-Mask", is the logical
  consequence of the conclusion derived from the expansion, or
  sub-division of the 'Address Class Range' that was outlined in RFC
  1517, 1518, and 1519. Needless to say, since 'the Quantified Sum of
  the 'Product of the Network and Host IP Addresses' for every Address
  Class in Table IV, is equal to the Total Number of IP Address
  assigned to the Range of the Address Class defined by Table III,
  then the Addressing Specifications shown by these Tables are
  mathematically equal. In which case, mathematically speaking, it
  should be concluded that the IPtX Specification, by RFC 1517, 1518,
  and 1519, is the interpretation of the IPv4 Specification derived
  from the use of the "Subnet-Mask".

 4.   The Structural Comparison  - IPv6  vs.  IPtX



  The handicaps from using an askew Binary System, the Loop-Back
  Address (127), and the Subnet-Mask (255), makes it impossible for
  the IPv4 Specification, even through the progressive expansion using
  32 Bit additions for an equal Address Space, to match the IP
  Addresses available in the IP Address Pool of the IPv6 Specification.
  And clearly, the same fate, according to Figures 1 and 2, will befall
  the IPtX Specification. However, because the IPtX Specification
  maintains an expansion capability defining an Infinitely Bit-Mapped
  IP Address Space using only a 64 Bit Header. In which, the
  'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone Routers' would be assigned a Network ID,
  which would absorb the Bit-String of the Address Space beyond the 32
  Bit-Mapped IP Address Space defined by the IPt1 Specification. And
  since, the losses represented by Figures 1 and 2, at infinity, are
  not discernable. The IPtX Specification maintains an IP Address Pool
  Capacity, which is theoretically, infinitely larger than the IP
  Address Pool availability in the IPv6 Specification (See Figure 3).

           IPv4 = 32 Bit Address Space

                                = 149,040,104 IP Addresses




                 IPv6 Specification

           IPv6 = 128 Bit Address Space

                          =  2^128 = X(2^32)

  The "Trunk-Identifier" Specification (Spec.) contains the Zone IP
  and IP Area Code. And given that Software can assign the Zone IP
  and IP Area Code to any location/destination. Eventually it will
  be necessary to know the 18 Digit IP Address: ZoneIP, IP Area Code,
  Network IP Address. And noting that any Trunk-Id beyond 96 Bits
  might seem ridiculous, because of the inherent limitations of the
  design specifications for the "Network Descriptor”, (+/0000:00).
  However, assigning a 'Router-ID' that requires Special
  Authentication between communicating Routers could easily absorb
  any Number of Bits beyond the IPt4 Specification.

  Nevertheless, it should be clearly understood, that if the
  'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone Routers' were assigned to the
  "Trunk-Identifier", then there must be a way to verify, resolve,
  or confirm the "Zone IP and the IP Area Code" Address defining the
  "Trunk-Identifier". In other words, the IPtX Specification can
  maintain the "Subnet-Identifier", use the "Network Descriptor"
  to verify the "Trunk-Identifier", and exhaust, without loss, every
  available IP Address in the Address Pool defined by the equation 1
  (eq-1):






   eq-1:    IPtX  = X(2^32) + 16,900,000 = Infinity



   eq-2:    IPv6  = X(2^32)

  is a '3' Step procedure, in which the first step exhaust all of
  the available IP Addresses in the IPv4 Specification. The second
  step requires changing the Symbol used as the "Network Designator"
  for the "Subnet-Identifier" (255 Or 256), and the third step
  requires expanding the function of the Switch for the "Network
  Descriptor". To achieve the first goal, multiply the Network and
  Host IP Addresses from Table IV, and use the product to represent
  the total number of Networks, leaving the Host total unchanged.
  And after the "Network Descriptor" and the "Subnet-Identifier"
  has been redefined, as provided in Table V. The adjusted results
  now reveals that the total number of available IP Addresses in
  the Address Pool for the IPtX Specification is equal to equation
  1, and it exceeds the amount assigned to the IPv6 Specification,
  when the size of the Bit-Mapped Address Space is equal to both
  Addressing Specifications (See Table VI).

 Note: From Table V, the "Network Designator", which is symbolized
       as; ' Ш  ', could just as easily, been assigned to defined
       any symbol, (e.g.; '257') except for ' 0 '(representing
       ' 00 ', the Binary equivalent of ' 1  ') and any assignment
       represented in the Range of the Addressing Specification. In
       any case, it should be clearly understood that when every
       available IP Address is used for IP Addressing. The IPtX
       Addressing Schematic, (where fig. 5 and fig. 6 respectively
       denotes IPt1 and IPt2 Specifications) becomes nothing more
       than an OVERLAY, which is used to facilitate the
       visualization of the Topology for the Structure of the
       Network Design. And this is an extremely important advantage
       when designing a Network containing hundreds (or thousands)
       of Servers and several thousand (or Million) Hosts assigned
       to Subnets. [It is important to note, ' Ш  ' represents the
       'NULL SET' or TRUE ZERO {the Traditional European
       Representation for True Zero}, and ' 0 ' is EQUAL to ' 00 ',
       which defines the Binary equivalence of ' 1 ':
       '00' = '0' = '1'.]

 Special Note: The simplification of the Network IP Addressing
               format into the 'Zone IP', the 'IP Area Code',
               and the 'Network IP Address', as provided by the
               IPtX Specification, could also REPLACE the format
               currently being used by the Telephone Systems all
               over the World. In other words, there is an EASY,
               'Off-The-Shelf' procedure for DIALING any Telephone
               Number defined by the 18 Digit String from the
               'IPtX' Specification:



 1. Dial First - Key in the digits representing the 'ZONE IP'

 2. Dial Next - Key in an Asterisk " * " the 'End-Start Statement'(:)'

 3. Dial Second - Key in the digits representing the 'IP AREA CODE' 

 4. Dial Next - Key in an Asterisk " * " the 'End-Start Statement'(:)'

 5. Dial Third - Key in the All '12' digits of the 'NETWORK IP ADDRESS'


   eg. Dialing  '123:213:121.0.12.3' = '123 * 213 * 121-000-012-003';
       Where it is not possible to define the Zone IP, IP Area Code,
       or Network IP Address with ' 0 '.

Special Note: In the IPtX Specification any Contiguous String of
              ZERO(s) is not a mathematically viable IP Address,
              because the IP Address Pool equation, X(X^32),
              defines a sequence of counting by successive
              additions of ‘1’. That is, using Zero(s), while not
              a problem for the IPtX Specification, it is however,
              a problem for IPv6. In other words, the problems
              inherent in the IPv6 Specification pertain primarily
              to the difficulties arising from the 48 Digit Number
              used to represent the Default format of an IP Address.
              And while there are Rules which define the use of the
              " :: " as the replacement for the Contiguous ZERO(s)
              String, because they are not mathematically viable,
              the problem is exacerbated. Furthermore, since I have
              not found any documentation that specifically defines
              how to distinguish between 2 or more Addresses
              defining a different number of ZERO(s) in the
              Contiguous String, which might occur in the Start,
              Middle, or Trailing portion of the Address. Clearly,
              the " :: " cannot be used as the solution for the size
              reduction of an IPv6 Address, or the replacement for a
              Contiguous String of ZERO(s), at least, not without
              the necessary Rule(s) explaining its use. Nevertheless,
              these inadequacies are further compounded by defining
              the IP Addressing Format as having a variable length,
              which may be greater than 128 Bits, and the "::" as a
              compressor of the leading and/or trailing zeros, or as
              the replacement for the multiple 16-bit Zero Groups
              with a specification that limits its use, number of
              occurrences, in an address. And this, needless to say,
              defines the gist of the mathematical failings of
              every supporting document, including RFC 2373, and
              more importantly, the reasons the Chinese developed
              the IPv9 Addressing Specification.

  It should have been quite clear from documents expounding the
  development of the design for the 'IPtX' Specification that the
  "Network Descriptor" provided the means to identify the
  "Trunk-Identifier", which defines the IP Address assigned to
  the 'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone Routers'. In other words, from
  'Table V - Definitions', the "Network Descriptor" allows for the
  resolution of the Trunk-Identifier ID and the resolution of the
  entire Length of the Network IP Address String. And while the
  "CIDR" notation was exploited even further during the creation
  of the IPv6 Specification; because the symbol, ' /128 ',
  specifies the length for the Bit-Mapped IP Address, which defines
  the size of the 128 Bit-Mapped IPv6 Address Space. The "Network
  Descriptor" provided the ability to separate, or distinguish
  between the addresses assigned to the 'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone
  Routers' and the 'Network IP Address'. And this specified the
  Length defining the Network IP Address as '32 Bits' in the IPtX
  Specification, even if the size of its Address Space was equal to
  or greater than the 128 Bit IPv6 Specification.

  Nevertheless, this procedure allows the retention of the more
  familiar structure defining a Network IP Address, which is similar
  to the ‘Telephone Number’ and defined by the IPv4 Specification.
  And clearly, this mathematically clarifies the interpretation of
  the IPtX Specification (See Table VII), which is logically derived
  from IPv4, by proving that the number of available Addresses in
  its IP Address Pool is greater than the IPv6 Specification.
  Furthermore, since it was only in the configuration of the Router
  where “CIDR” was addressed, “CIDR”, as with the “Network
  Descriptor” can be automatic, and remain only as the concerns for
  the Network Engineer, because its affect lies outside the boundary
  of the Network Domain. In other words, IPtX is a more powerful and
  cost effective IP Addressing Specification, which allows the
  interface of the “Front-End” to mimic or simulate the IPv4
  Specification, a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address, in the Backbone
  environment of an unlimited size IP Address Space.
