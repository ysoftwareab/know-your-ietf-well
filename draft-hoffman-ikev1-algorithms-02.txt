Abstract

   The required and suggested algorithms in the original IKEv1
   specification does not reflect the current reality of IPsec market.
   It requires allowing weak security and suggests algorithms that are
   thinly implemented.  This document updates RFC 2409, the original
   specification, and is intended for all IKEv1 implementations deployed
   today.

Internet-Draft            Algorithms for IKEv1             November 2004


1.  Introduction

   The original IKEv1 definition, [RFC2409], has a set of MUST-level and
   SHOULD-level requirements that do not match the needs of IPsec users.
   This document updates RFC by changing the algorithm requirements
   defined there.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Old algorithm requirements

   RFC 2409 has the following MUST-level and SHOULD-level requirements:

   o  DES for encryption MUST be supported
   o  MD5 and SHA-1 for hashing and HMAC functions MUST be supported
   o  Pre-shared secrets for authentication MUST be supported
   o  Diffie-Hellman MODP group 1 (discrete log 768 bits) MUST be
      supported
   o  TripleDES for encryption SHOULD be supported
   o  Tiger for hashing SHOULD be supported
   o  DSA and RSA for authentication with signatures SHOULD be supported
   o  RSA for authentication with encryption SHOULD be supported
   o  Diffie-Hellman MODP group 2 (discrete log 1024 bits) SHOULD be
      supported

   RFC 2409 gives two conflicting requirement levels for Diffie-Hellman
   MODP groups with elliptic curves.  Section 4 of that specification
   says "IKE implementations ...  MAY support ECP and EC2N groups", but
   Sections 6.3 and 6.4 say that MODP groups 3 and 4 for EC2N groups
   SHOULD be supported.

3.  New algorithm requirements

   The new requirements for IKEv1 are:

   o  TripleDES for encryption MUST be supported
   o  AES-128 in CBC mode [RFC3602] SHOULD be supported
   o  SHA-1 for hashing and HMAC functions MUST be supported
   o  Pre-shared secrets for authentication MUST be supported
   o  AES-128 in CBC mode for HMAC functions ([RFC3566] and [RFC3664])
      SHOULD be supported
   o  Diffie-Hellman MODP group 2 (discrete log 1024 bits) MUST be
      supported
   o  Diffie-Hellman MODP group 14 (discrete log 2048 bits) [RFC3526]
      SHOULD be supported

   o  RSA for authentication with signatures SHOULD be supported

   The other algorithms that were listed at MUST-level and SHOULD-level
   in RFC 2409 are now MAY-level.  This includes DES for encryption, MD5
   and Tiger for hashing, Diffie-Hellman MODP group 1, Diffie-Hellman
   MODP groups with elliptic curves, DSA for authentication with
   signatures, and RSA for authentication with encryption.  DES for
   encryption, MD5 for hashing, Diffie-Hellman MODP group 1 are dropped
   to MAY due to cryptographic weakness.  Tiger for hashing,
   Diffie-Hellman MODP groups with elliptic curves, DSA for
   authentication with signatures, and RSA for authentication with
   encryption are dropped due to lack of any significant deployment and
   interoperability.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document is all about security.  All the algorithms that are
   either MUST-level or SHOULD-level in the "new algoritm requirements"
   section of this document are believed to be robust and secure at the
   time of this writing.
