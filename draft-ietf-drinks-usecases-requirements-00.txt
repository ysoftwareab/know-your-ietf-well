Abstract

   This document captures the use cases and associated requirements for
   interfaces to provision session establishment data into SIP Service
   Provider components that aid with session routing.  Specifically, the
   current version of this document focuses on the provisioning of one
   such element, termed the registry.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terms from [RFC3261] (e.g., SIP) and [RFC5486]
   (e.g., LUF, LRF).  In addition, this document specifies the following
   additional terms.


   Registry:   The authoritative source for provisioned session
      establishment data (SED) and related information.



   Local Data Repository:   The data store component of an addressing
      server that provides resolution responses.



   Destination Group:   A set of public identities that are grouped
      together to facilitate session setup and routing.



   Public Identity:   A generic term that refers to a telephone number
      (TN), an email address, or other identity as deemed appropriate,
      such as a globally routable URI of a user address (e.g.,
      mailto:john.doe@example.net).



   Routing Group:   a grouping of SED records.



   SED Record:   A SED Record contains much of the session establishment
      data or a 'redirect' to another registry where the session
      establishment data can be discovered.  SED Records types supported
      are NAPTRs, CNAME, DNAME, and NS Records.

   Data Recipient:   SP or SSP that receives or consumes SED and related
      information.



   Data Recipient Group:   A group of Data Recipients that receive the
      same set (or subset) of SED and related information.

2.  Overview

   The SPEERMINT WG specifies Session Establishment Data, or SED, as the
   data used to route a call to the next hop associated with the called
   domain's ingress point.  More specifically, the SED is the set of
   parameters that the outgoing signalling path border elements (SBEs)
   need to complete the call.  See [RFC5486] for more details.

   The specification of the format and protocols to configure SED is a
   task taken up by the DRINKS WG.  The use cases and requirements that
   have been proposed in this regard are compiled in this document.

   SED is typically created by the terminating SSP and consumed by the
   originating SSP.  For scalability reasons SED is rarely exchanged
   directly between the intended parties.  Instead, it is exchanged via
   intermediate systems - termed Registries within this document.  Such
   registries receive SED via provisioning transactions from other SSPs,
   and then distribute the received data into Local Data Repositories.
   These local data repositories are used for call routing by outgoing
   SBEs.  This is depicted in Figure 1.

   In this version of the document, we primarily address the use cases
   and requirements for provisioning registries.  Future revisions may
   include data distribution.  The resulting provisioning protocol can
   be used to provision data into a registry, or between registries.
   This is depicted in Figure 2.

                       Figure 2: Functional Overview


   The following is a summary of the proposed responsibilities for
   Registries and Local Data Repositories:

   o  Registries are the authoritative source for provisioned session
      establishment data (SED) and related information.


   o  Local Data Repositories are the data store component of an
      addressing server that provides resolution responses.

Internet-Draft          ietf-drinks-usecases-reqs               May 2009


   o  Registries are responsible for distributing SED and related
      information to the local data repositories.



   In addition, this document proposes the following aggregation groups
   with regards to SED (certain use cases also illustrate these groups):

   o  Aggregation of public Identifiers: The initial input "key" to a
      SED lookup is a public identifier.  Since many public identifiers
      will share similar (or identical) destinations, and hence return
      similar (or identical) SED, provisioning the same set of SED for
      millions of public identifiers is inefficient, especially in cases
      where the SED needs to be modified.  Therefore, an aggregation
      mechanism to "group" public identifiers is proposed.  This
      aggregation is called a "destination group".


   o  Aggregation of SSPs: It is expected that SSPs may want to expose
      different sets of SED, depending on the receiving SSP.  This
      exposure may not always be unique, in which case an aggregation
      makes it efficient.  Such an aggregation is proposed, and termed
      "Data Receipient Group".


   o  Aggregation of SED records: Finally, it is anticipated that a
      complete set of routing data will consist of more than just one
      SED record.  To be able to create and use the same set of SED
      records multiple times (without creating duplicates) an
      aggregation mechanism at this level is proposed, and called
      "routing group".


   The above aggregations are illustrated in Figure 3.

3.  Use Cases and Requirements

   This section presents the use cases and associated requirements.

3.1.  Registry Provisioning

   Registry is the authoritative source for session establishment data
   (SED).  The registry needs to be provisioned with this data to
   perform its function.  This data includes: destination groups,
   routing groups and data recipient groups.  It can also include RNs
   and TN Ranges.  The following sub-sections illustrate the use cases
   and the requirements, respectively.

3.1.1.  Use Cases

   USE CASE #1   Near-real-time provisioning: The registry is
                 provisioned with data that is not accompanied by an
                 effective date or time.  In such cases, the registry
                 will validate the data and make it effective in near
                 real-time.



   USE CASE #2   Non-real-time provisioning: The registry is provisioned
                 via an asynchronous provisioning process.  For
                 instance, an SSP has commissioned a new registry and
                 wishes to download a very large number of telephone
                 numbers.  Rather than stream individual entities, one
                 at a time, the SSP's back-office system prefers to
                 perform the operation as a set of one or more batches
                 (e.g., via an external data file), instead of the near-
                 real-time provisioning interface.



   USE CASE #3   Deferred provisioning: The registry is provisioned with
                 data that is accompanied by an effective date and time.
                 In scenarios such as this, the registry will validate
                 the data and wait until the effective date and time to
                 make it effective.  TBD: What happens if near-real time
                 data overrides data parked for later incorporation?



   USE CASE #4   Intra-network SED: SSP wishes to provision their intra-
                 network Session Establishment Data (SED) such that it
                 enables current and future network services to identify
                 and route real-time sessions.  For example, in the case



Channabasappa, Ed.      Expires November 28, 2009              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          ietf-drinks-usecases-reqs               May 2009


                 of VoIP calls it allows one SoftSwitch (calling) to
                 discover another (called).  The SSP provisions IP
                 addressing information pertaining to each SoftSwitch,
                 which is provisioned to the registry but only
                 distributed to a specific local data repository.  This
                 SED may differ from the SED that is distributed to
                 other local data repositories.



   USE CASE #5   Destination Groups: An SSP may wish to control the flow
                 of traffic into their network (ingress) based on
                 groupings of Public Identities.  Associating each group
                 of Public Identities with a specific set of ingress
                 SBEs or points-of-interconnect.  The SSP, for example,
                 sub-divides the country into four regions: North-East,
                 South-East, Mid-West, and West-Coast.  For each region
                 they establish points-of-interconnect with peers and
                 provision the associated SED hostnames or IP addresses
                 of the SBEs used for ingress traffic.  Against each
                 region they provision the served Public Identities into
                 groups- termed Destination Groups - and associate those
                 destination groups with the appropriate points of
                 ingres.

   USE CASE #6   Public Identity is taken out of service: A public
                 identity (or a TN range) is taken out of service
                 because it is no longer valid.  The Registry receives a
                 delete operation and removes the public identity from
                 its database.  This can also trigger delete operations
                 to keep the local data repositories up-to-date.



   USE CASE #7   Assigning a set of public identities to a different
                 Destination Group: A set of public identities are
                 assigned a different Destination Group which
                 effectively changes their routing information.  This
                 may be due to a network re-arrangement, a Signaling
                 path Border Element being split into two, or a need to
                 do maintenance, two carriers merging, or other
                 considerations.  This scenario can also include an
                 effective date and time.

   USE CASE #8   Moving an SSP from one Data Recipient Group to another:
                 An SSP would like to re-assign the Destination Groups
                 it shares with a peer and move the peer SSP from one
                 Data Recipient Group to another.  This results in the
                 moved peer seeing a new and different set of routing
                 data.



   USE CASE #9   Inter-network SED (Direct and Selective Peering): In
                 this case the SSP is the actual carrier-of-record; the
                 entity serving the end-user.  The SSP wishes to
                 communicate different SED data to some of its peers
                 that wish to route to its destinations.  So the SSP has
                 implemented direct points-of-interconnect with each
                 peer and therefore would like address-resolution to
                 result in different answers depending on which peer is
                 asking.



   USE CASE #10  Separation of Responsibility: An SSP's operational
                 practices can seperate the responsibility of
                 provisioning the routing information, and the
                 associated identities, to different entities.  For
                 example, a network engineer can establish a physical
                 interconnect with a peering SSP's network and provision
                 the associated domain name, host, and IP addressing
                 information.  Separately, for each new service
                 subscription, the SSP's back office system provisions
                 the associated public identities.



   USE CASE #11  Global TN Destinations: The SSP wishes to add or remove
                 one or multiple fully qualified TN destinations in a
                 single provisioning request.



   USE CASE #12  TN Range Destinations: The SSP wishes to add or remove
                 one or multiple TN Range destinations in a single
                 provisioning request.  TN Ranges support number ranges
                 that need not be 'blocks'.  In other words the TN range
                 start can be any number and the TN range end can be any
                 number that is greater than the TN range start.

   USE CASE #13  Non-TN Destinations: An SSP chooses to peer their
                 messaging service with another SSPs picture/video mail
                 service.  Allowing a user to send and receive pictures
                 and/or video messages to a mobile user's handset, for
                 example.  The important aspect of this use case is that
                 it goes beyond simply mapping TNs to IP addresses/
                 hostnames that describe points-of-interconnect between
                 peering network SSP's.  Rather, for each user the SSP
                 provisions the subscriber's email address (i.e.
                 jane.doe@example.com).  This mapping allows the mobile
                 multimedia messaging service center (MMSC) to use the
                 subscriber email address as the lookup key and route
                 messages accordingly.



   USE CASE #14  Tier 2 Name Server: An SSP maintains a Tier 2 name
                 server that contains the NAPTR records that constitute
                 the terminal step in the LUF.  The SSP needs to
                 provision an registry to direct queries for the SSPs
                 numbers to the Tier 2.  Usually queries to the registry
                 should return NS records, but, in cases where the Tier
                 2 uses a different domain suffix from that used in the
                 registry, CNAME and NS records may be employed instead.



   USE CASE #15  Peering Offer/Acceptance: An SSP offers to allow
                 terminations from another SSP by adding that SSP to a
                 Data Recipient Group it controls.  This causes
                 notification of the offered SSP.  An SSP receiving a
                 peering offer should be able to accept or decline the
                 offer.  If the offer is rejected the Registry should
                 not provision corresponding SED to the rejecting SSP.
                 It is expected that this capability will apply mainly
                 in the transit case where non-authoritative parties (in
                 the sense of not being the terminating SSP for an
                 identity) wish to offer the ability to reach the
                 identity and originating SSPs may wish to restrict the
                 routes that are provisioned to their local data
                 repositories.



   USE CASE #16  Points of Egress: An SSP has a peering relationship
                 with a peer, and when sending messages to that peer's
                 point of interconnection, the originating SSP wishes to
                 use one or more points of egress.  These points of

                 egress may vary for an given peer.  This capability is
                 supported by allowing an originating SSP to provision
                 SED for identities terminating to other SSPs where the
                 originating SSP is itself the data recipient.  The
                 provisioning SSP may make use of multiple data
                 recipient identities if it requires different sets of
                 egress points be used for calls originating from
                 different parts of its network.  Routing from egress
                 points to ingress points of the terminating SSP may be
                 accomplished by static routing from the egress points
                 or by the egress points using data provisioned to the
                 Registry by the terminating SSP.



3.1.2.  Requirements


   The following data requirements apply:

   DREQ1:  The registry provisioning data model MUST support the
           following entities: public identities, destination groups,
           routing groups and data recipient groups.


   DREQ2:  The registry provisioning data model MUST support the
           grouping and aggregation of public identities within
           destination groups.


   DREQ3:  The registry provisioning data model SHOULD support the
           grouping and aggregation of TN Ranges within destination
           groups.


   DREQ4:  The registry provisioning data model SHOULD support the
           grouping and aggregation of RNs within destination groups.



   The following functional requirements apply:

   FREQ1:   The registry provisioning interface MUST support the
            creation and deletion of: public identities, destination
            groups, routing groups and data recipient groups.






Channabasappa, Ed.      Expires November 28, 2009              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          ietf-drinks-usecases-reqs               May 2009


   FREQ2:   The registry provisioning interface MUST support near-real-
            time, non-real-time and deferred provisioning operations.


   FREQ3:   The registry provisioning interface MUST support the
            following types of modifications:

            - reassignment of one or more public identities from one
            destination group to another;

            - reassignment of one data recipient from one destination
            group to another;

            - association and disassociation of a "Default Routing
            Group" with a Data Recipient; and,

            - identification of a destination group as a "Primary
            Provider" destination group or a "Transit" destination
            group.


   FREQ4:   When an entity with a different client identifier than that
            of the carrier of record for a public identity in a
            destination group adds a new SSP to a destination recipient
            group associated with that destination group, the registry
            provisioning interface MUST: a) notify the new SSP of the
            updated routing information (which constitutes a peering
            offer) b) not provision the SED to the new SSP's LDR unless
            the new SSP signals acceptance.

   FREQ5:   The registry provisioning interface MUST separate the
            provisioning of the routing information from the associated
            identities.


   FREQ6:   The registry provisioning protocol MUST define a discrete
            set of response codes for each supported protocol operation.
            Each response code MUST definitively indicate whether the
            operation succeeded or failed.  If the operation failed, the
            response code MUST indicate the reason for the failure.


   FREQ7:   The registry provisioning interface MUST allow an SSP to
            define multiple sub-identities that can be used in data
            recipient groups

Internet-Draft          ietf-drinks-usecases-reqs               May 2009


   FREQ8:   The registry provisioning interface MUST define the
            concurrency rules, locking rules, and race conditions that
            underlie the implementation of that protocol operation and
            that result from the coexistence of protocol operations that
            can operate on multiple objects in a single operation and
            bulk file operations that may process for an extended period
            of time.


   FREQ9:   The registry provisioning interface MUST support the ability
            for a Data Recipient to optionally define a Routing Group as
            their Default Routing Group, such that if the Data Recipient
            performs a resolution request and the lookup key being
            resolved is not found in the Destination Groups visible to
            that Data Recipient then the SED Records associated with the
            Default Routing Group shall be returned in the resolution
            response.

   FREQ10:  The registry provisioning interface MUST support the ability
            for the owner of a Routing Group to optionally define Source
            Based Routing Criteria to be associated with their Routing
            Group(s).  The Source Based Routing Criteria will include
            the ability to specify zero or more of the following in
            association with a given Routing Group: Resolution Client IP
            Address(es) or Domain Names, Calling Party URI(s).  The
            result will be that the resolution server would evaluate the
            characteristics of the Source, compare them against Source
            Based Routing Criteria associated with the Routing Groups
            visible to that Data Recipient, and return any SED Records
            associated with the matching Routing Groups.

   FREQ11:  The registry provisioning interface MUST track, via a client
            identifier, the entity provisioning each data object (e.g.
            Destination Group or Routing Group ).  This client
            identifier will identify the entity that is responsible for
            that data object from a protocol interface perspective.
            This client identifier SHOULD be tied to the session
            authentication credentials that the client uses to connect
            into to the registry.

            The registry provisioning interface MUST incorporate a data
            recipient identifier that identifies the organization
            responsible for each data object from a business
            perspective.  This organization identifier may or may not
            ultimately refer to the same organization that the client
            Identifier refers to.  The separation of the data recipient
            identifier from the client identifier will allow for the
            separation of the two entities, when the need arises.

            Exactly one client identifier MUST be allowed to provision
            objects under a given data recipient identifier.  But a
            client identifier MUST be allowed to provision objects under
            multiple data recipient identifiers.

            Objects provisioned under one "Protocol Client Identifier"
            MUST NOT be alterable by a provisioning session established
            by another "Protocol Client Identifier".


3.2.  Distribution of data into local data repositories

   This section targets use cases concerned with the distribution of SED
   to local data repositories.  This is considered out-of-scope for this
   version of the document.

3.3.  Miscellaneous Use Cases

   This section contains additional use cases for consideration.

3.3.1.  Indirect Peering to Selected Destinations

   The SSP transit provider wishes to provide transit peering points for
   a set of destinations.  But that set of destinations does not align
   with the destination groups that already exist.  The SSP wishes to
   establish its own destination groups for the destinations that it
   provides transit to.

3.3.2.  TBD: RN Destinations

   The SSP does not wish to provision individual TNs, but instead, for
   ease of management, wishes to provision Routing Numbers ((e.g., as in
   some number portability implementations).  Each RN effectively
   represents a set of individual TNs, and that set of TNs is assumed to
   change 'automatically' as TNs are ported in and ported out.  Note
   that this approach requires a query to resolve a TN to an RN prior to
   using the provisioned data to route.

4.  Security Considerations

   Session establishment data allows for the routing of SIP sesions
   within, and between, SIP Service Providers.  Access to this data can
   compromise the routing of sessions and expose a SIP Service Provider
   to attacks such as service hijacking and denial of service.  The data
   can be compromised by vulnerable functional components and interfaces
   identified within the use cases.
