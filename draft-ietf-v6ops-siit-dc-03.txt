SIIT-DC: Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Data Centre Environments
                      draft-ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-03

Abstract

   This document describes the use of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
   (SIIT) algorithm in an IPv6 Internet Data Centre (IDC).  In this
   deployment model, traffic from legacy IPv4-only clients on the
   Internet is translated to IPv6 upon reaching the IDC operator's
   network infrastructure.  From that point on, it may be treated the
   same as traffic from native IPv6 end users.  The IPv6 endpoints may
   be numbered using arbitrary (non-IPv4-translatable) IPv6 addresses.
   This facilitates a single-stack IPv6-only network infrastructure, as
   well as efficient utilisation of public IPv4 addresses.

   The primary audience is IDC operators who are deploying IPv6, running
   out of available IPv4 addresses, and/or feel that dual stack causes
   undesirable operational complexity.

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   Historically, dual stack [RFC4213] [RFC6883] has been the recommended
   way to transition from a legacy IPv4-only environment to one capable
   of serving IPv6 users.  However, for IDC operators, dual stack
   operation has a number of disadvantages compared to single stack
   operation.  In particular, running two protocols rather than one
   results in increased complexity and operational overhead, with little
   return on investment for as long as large parts of the public
   Internet remains predominantly IPv4-only.  Furthermore, the dual
   stack approach does not in any way help with the depletion of the
   IPv4 address space, which at the time of writing is a pressing
   concern in most parts of the world.

   Therefore, some IDC operators may instead prefer an approach in which
   they only need to operate one protocol in the data centre as they
   prepare for the future.  SIIT-DC is one such approach.  Its design
   goals include:

   o  Promote the deployment of native IPv6 services (cf. [RFC6540]).

   o  Provide IPv4 service availability for legacy users with no loss of
      performance or functionality.

   o  To ensure that that the legacy users' IPv4 addresses remain
      visible to the nodes and applications located in the IPv6 network.

   o  To conserve and maximise the utilisation of the operator's public
      IPv4 addresses.

   o  To avoid introducing more complexity than absolutely necessary,
      especially on the nodes and applications.

   o  To be easy to scale and deploy in a fault-tolerant manner.

   The following subsections elaborates on how SIIT-DC meets these
   goals.

1.1.  Single Stack IPv6 Operation

   SIIT-DC allows IDC operators to build their infrastructure and
   applications on an IPv6-only foundation.  IPv4 end-user connectivity
   becomes a service provided by the network, which systems
   administration and application development staff do not need to
   concern themselves with.  This promotes universal IPv6 deployment for
   the IDC operator's services and applications.

   SIIT-DC requires no special support or change from the underlying
   IPv6 infrastructure, it is compatible with all standard IPv6
   networks.  Traffic between IPv6-enabled end users and IPv6-enabled

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   services will always be transported native end-to-end; SIIT-DC does
   not intercept or handle native IPv6 traffic at all.

   When the day comes to discontinue all support for IPv4, no change
   needs to be made to the overall architecture - it's only a matter of
   shutting off the SIIT-DC Border Relays (BRs).  Operators who deploy
   native IPv6 along with SIIT-DC will thus avoid requiring any future
   migration or deployment projects relating to IPv6 deployment and/or
   IPv4 sun-setting.

1.2.  Stateless Operation

   Unlike other solutions that provide either dual stack availability to
   single-stack services (e.g., Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146] and Layer-4/7
   proxies), or that provide conservation of IPv4 addresses (e.g.,
   NAPT44 [RFC3022]), SIIT-DC does not maintain any state associated
   with individual connections or flows.  In this sense it operates
   exactly like a regular IP router, and has similar scaling properties
   - the limiting factors are packets per second and bandwidth.  The
   number of concurrent flows and flow initiation rates are irrelevant
   for performance.

   This not only allows individual BRs to easily attain "line rate"
   performance, it also allows for per-packet load balancing between
   multiple BRs using Equal-Cost Multipath Routing [RFC2991].
   Asymmetric routing is also acceptable, which makes it easy to avoid
   sub-optimal traffic patterns; the prefixes involved may be anycasted
   from all the BRs in the provider's network, thus ensuring that the
   most optimal path through the network is used, even where the optimal
   path in one direction differs from the optimal path in the opposite
   direction.

   Finally, stateless operation means that high availability is easily
   achieved.  If a BR should fail, its traffic can be re-routed onto
   another BR using a standard IP routing protocol.  This does not
   impact existing flows any more than what any other IP re-routing
   event would.

1.3.  IPv4 Address Conservation

   In most parts of the world, it is difficult or even impossible to
   obtain generously sized IPv4 delegation from the Internet Numbers
   Registry System [RFC7020].  The resulting scarcity in turn impacts
   individual end users and operators, which might be forced to purchase
   IPv4 addresses from other operators in order to cover their needs.
   This process can be risky to business continuity, in the case no
   suitable block for sale can be located, and/or turn out to be
   prohibitively expensive.  In spite of this, an IDC operator will find

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   that providing IPv4 service remains essential, as a large share of
   the Internet end users still do not have IPv6 connectivity.

   A key goal of SIIT-DC is to help reduce a data centre operator's IPv4
   address requirement to the absolute minimum, by allowing the operator
   to remove them entirely from nodes and applications that do not need
   to communicate with endpoints in the IPv4 Internet.  One example
   would be servers that are operating in a supporting/back-end role and
   only communicates with other servers (database servers, file servers,
   and so on).  Another example would be the network infrastructure
   itself (router-to-router links, loopback addresses, and so on).
   Furthermore, as LAN prefix sizes must always be rounded up to the
   nearest power of two (or larger, if one reserves space for future
   growth), even more IPv4 addresses will often end up being wasted
   without even being used.

   With SIIT-DC, the operator can remove these valuable IPv4 addresses
   from his back-end servers and network infrastructure, and reassign
   them to the SIIT-DC service as IPv4 Service Addresses.  There exists
   no requirement that IPv4 Service Addresses are assigned in an
   aggregated manner, so there is nothing lost due to infrastructure
   overhead; every single IPv4 address assigned to SIIT-DC can be used
   an IPv4 Service Address.

1.4.  Clients' IPv4 Source Addresses Visible to Applications

   SIIT-DC uses the [RFC6052] algorithm to map the entire end-user's
   IPv4 source address into an predefined IPv6 Translation Prefix.  This
   ensures that there is no loss of information; the end-user's IPv4
   source address remains available to the application located in the
   IPv6 network, allowing it to perform tasks like Geo-Location,
   logging, abuse handling, and so forth.

1.5.  Compatible with Standard IPv4 and IPv6 Stacks

   Except for the introduction of the BRs themselves, no change to the
   network, nodes, applications, or anything else is required in order
   to support SIIT-DC.  SIIT-DC is practically invisible from the point
   of view of the IPv4 clients, the IPv6 nodes, the IPv6 data centre
   network, and the IPv4 Internet.  SIIT-DC interoperates with all
   standards-compliant IPv4 or IPv6 stacks.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   SIIT-DC Border Relay (BR)




Anderson                 Expires April 14, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


      A device or a logical function that performs stateless protocol
      translation between IPv4 and IPv6.  It MUST do so in accordance
      with [RFC6145] and [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-eam].

   SIIT-DC Edge Relay (ER)
      A device or logical function that provides "native" IPv4
      connectivity to IPv4-only devices or application software.  It is
      very similar in function to a BR, but is typically located close
      to the IPv4-only component(s) it is supporting rather than on the
      IDC's outer network border.  The ER is an optional component of
      SIIT-DC.  It is discussed in more detail in
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].

   IPv4 Service Address
      An IPv4 address representing a node or service located in an IPv6
      network.  It is coupled with an IPv6 Service Address using an EAM.
      Packets sent to this address is translated to IPv6 by the BR, and
      possibly back to IPv4 by an ER, before reaching the node or
      service.

   IPv4 Service Address Pool
      One or more IPv4 prefixes routed to the BR's IPv4 interface.  IPv4
      Service Addresses are allocated from this pool.  That this does
      not necessarily have to be a "pool" per se, as it could also be
      one or more host routes (whose prefix length is equal to /32).
      The purpose of using a pool rather than host routes is to
      facilitate IPv4 route aggregation and ease provisioning of new
      IPv4 Service Addresses.

   IPv6 Service Address
      An IPv6 address assigned to an application, node, or service;
      either directly or indirectly (through an ER).  It is coupled with
      an IPv4 Service Address using an EAM.  IPv4-only clients
      communicates with the IPv6 Service Address through SIIT-DC.

   Explicit Address Mapping (EAM)
      A bi-directional coupling between an IPv4 Service Address and an
      IPv6 Service Address configured in a BR or ER.  When translating
      between IPv4 and IPv6, the BR/ER changes the address fields in the
      translated packet's IP header according to any matching EAM.  The
      EAM algorithm is specified in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-eam].

   Translation Prefix

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


      An IPv6 prefix into which the entire IPv4 address space is mapped,
      according to the algorithm in [RFC6052].  The Translation Prefix
      is routed to the BR's IPv6 interface.  When translating between
      IPv4 and IPv6, an BR/ER will insert/remove the Translation Prefix
      into/from the address fields in the translated packet's IP header,
      unless an EAM exists for the IP address that is being translated.

   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses
      As defined in Section 1.3 of [RFC6052].

   IDC
      Short for "Internet Data Centre"; a data centre whose main purpose
      is to deliver services to the public Internet, the use case SIIT-
      DC is primarily targeted at.  IDCs are typically operated by
      Internet Content Providers or Managed Services Providers.

   SIIT
      The Stateless IP/ICMP Translation algorithm, as specified in
      [RFC6145].

   XLAT
      Short for "Translation".  Used in figures to indicate where a BR/
      ER uses SIIT [RFC6145] to translate IPv4 packets to IPv6 and vice
      versa.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

                                 Figure 1

   In Figure 1, 192.0.2.0/24 is the IPv4 Service Address Pool.
   Individual IPv4 Service Addresses are assigned from this prefix, and
   traffic destined for it is routed to the BR's IPv4-facing network
   interface.  There are no restrictions on how many IPv4 Service
   Address Pools are used or their prefix length, as long as they are
   all routed to the BR's IPv4-facing network interface.

   When translating packets between IPv4 and IPv6, the BR uses the EAM
   to replace any occurrence of the IPv4 Service Address (192.0.2.1)
   with its corresponding IPv6 Service Address (2001:db8:12:34::1).
   Addresses that do not match any EAM configured in the BR are
   translated by inserting or removing the Translation Prefix
   (2001:db8:46::/96), cf. Section 2.2 of [RFC6052].

   The BR can be deployed as a separate device or as a logical function
   in another multi-purpose device, such as an IP router.  Any number of
   BRs may exist simultaneously in the IDC's network infrastructure, as
   long as they all configured with the same Translation Prefix and an
   identical EAM Table.

   The IPv6 Service Address of should be registered in DNS using an "IN
   AAAA" record, while its corresponding IPv4 Service Address should be
   registered using an "IN A" record.  This ensures that IPv6-capable
   clients access the application/service directly using its native IPv6
   end-to-end, while IP4-only clients will access it through SIIT-DC.

3.1.  Packet Flow

   In this example, the "IPv4-only user" from Figure 1 initiates a
   connection to the application running on the IPv6-only server.  After
   first having looked up the "IN A" record in DNS, the user starts by
   transmitting an TCP SYN packet to the IPv4 Service Address.  This
   IPv4 packet is routed to the BR, and is there translated to IPv6 as
   follows:

                         IPv4 to IPv6 translation

        +--[IPv4]----------+     +--[IPv6]-----------------------+
        | SRC 203.0.113.50 |     | SRC 2001:db8:46::203.0.113.50 |
        | DST 192.0.2.1    | --> | DST 2001:db8:12:34::1         |
        | TCP SYN [..]     |     | TCP SYN [..]                  |
        +------------------+     +-------------------------------+

                                 Figure 2

   The resulting IPv6 packet is routed to the IPv6-only server, which
   processes and responds to it as if it had been a native IPv6 packet
   all along.  The server's IPv6 response packet is then routed back to
   the BR, where it is translated back to IPv4 as follows:

                         IPv6 to IPv4 translation

        +--[IPv6]-----------------------+      +--[IPv4]----------+
        | SRC 2001:db8:12:34::1         |      | SRC 192.0.2.1    |
        | DST 2001:db8:46::203.0.113.50 | -->  | DST 203.0.113.50 |
        | TCP SYN/ACK [..]              |      | TCP SYN/ACK [..] |
        +-------------------------------+      +------------------+

                                 Figure 3

   It is important to note that neither the IPv4 client nor the IPv6
   server/application need any special support to participate in SIIT-
   DC.  However, the application may optionally be taught to extract the
   embedded IPv4 source address from incoming IPv6 packets with source
   addresses within the Translation Prefix.  This will allow it to

4.  Deployment Considerations and Guidelines

4.1.  Application/Device Support for IPv6

   SIIT-DC as described in this document requires that the application
   (and/or the node the application is located on) supports IPv6
   networking, and that it has no dependency on local IPv4 network
   connectivity.

   SIIT-DC can however support legacy IPv4-dependent applications and
   nodes through the introduction of an ER.  The ER provides the legacy
   application or node with seemingly native IPv4 Internet connectivity,
   so that it may operate correctly in an otherwise IPv6-only network
   environment.  This approach is described in more detail in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].

4.2.  Application Support for NAT

   The operator should carefully examine whether or not the application
   protocols he would like to use SIIT-DC with are able to operate in a
   network environment where rewriting of IP addresses occur.  In
   general, if an application layer protocol works correctly through
   standard NAT44 (see [RFC3235]), it will most likely work correctly
   through SIIT-DC as well.

   Higher-level protocols that embed IP addresses as part of their
   payload are particularly problematic [RFC2663] [RFC2993] [RFC3022].
   One well-known example of such a protocol is FTP [RFC0959].  Such
   protocols can be made to work with SIIT-DC through the introduction
   of an ER, which provides end-to-end IPv4 address transparency by
   reversing the translations performed by the BR before passing the
   packets to the NAT-incompatible application.  This approach is
   described in more detail in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].

4.3.  Application Communication Pattern

   SIIT-DC is best suited for traditional client/server applications
   where IPv4-only clients on the Internet initiate traffic towards an
   IPv6-only service, which in turn is passively listening for inbound
   traffic and responding as necessary.  In this case, an IPv4 client
   looks exactly like an native IPv6 client from the IPv6 service's
   point of view, and thus does not require any special treatment.  One
   particularly common application protocol that follows this client/
   server communication pattern, and thus is ideally suited for use with
   SIIT-DC, is HTTP [RFC7230].

   It is also possible to combine SIIT-DC with DNS64 [RFC6147] in order
   to allow an IPv6-only application to initiate communication with



Anderson                 Expires April 14, 2016                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   IPv4-only nodes through SIIT-DC.  However, in this case, care must be
   taken so that all outgoing communication is sourced from an IPv6
   Service Address that is found in an EAM configured in the BR.  If
   another address is used, the BR will most likely be unable to
   translate it to IPv4, causing the packet to be discarded.  This could
   be prevented by altering the Default Address Selection Policy Table
   [RFC6724] on the IPv6 node.

   An alternative approach to the above would be to place an ER in front
   of the application in question, as described
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].  This provides the application with
   seemingly native IPv4 connectivity, which it may use freely for bi-
   directional communication with the IPv4 Internet.  An application or
   node located behind an ER does not need to worry about selecting a
   specific source address, as it will only have valid options
   available.

4.4.  Choice of Translation Prefix

   Either a Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) from the provider's own IPv6
   address space or the IANA-allocated Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96
   (WKP) may be used.  From a technical point of view, both work equally
   well.  However, only a single WKP exists, so if a provider would like
   to deploy more than one instance of SIIT-DC in his network, or
   another translation technology such as Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146], the
   operator will be forced to use an NSP for all but one of those
   deployments.

   Another consideration is that the WKP cannot be used in inter-domain
   routing.  By using an NSP instead, SIIT-DC will support a deployment
   where the BR and the IPv6 Service Address are located in different
   Autonomous Systems.

   The Translation Prefix may use any of the lengths described in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC6052], but /96 has two distinct advantages over
   the others.  First, converting it to IPv4 can be done in a single
   operation by simply stripping off the first 96 bits; second, it
   allows for IPv4 addresses to be embedded directly into the text
   representation of an IPv6 address using the familiar dotted quad
   notation, e.g., "2001:db8::198.51.100.10" (cf. Section 2.4 of
   [RFC6052])), instead of being converted to hexadecimal notation.
   This makes it easier to write IPv6 ACLs and similar that match
   translated endpoints in the IPv4 Internet.

   For the reasons discussed above, this document recommends that an NSP
   with a prefix length of /96 is used.  Section 3.3 of [RFC6052]
   discusses the choice of translation prefix in more detail.

4.5.  Routing Considerations

   The prefixes that constitute the IPv4 Service Address Pool and the
   IPv6 Translation Prefix may be routed to the BRs as any other IPv4 or
   IPv6 route in the provider's network.  If more than one BR is being
   deployed, it is recommended that a routing protocol (IGP) used to
   advertise the routes within the provider's network.  This will ensure
   that the traffic that is to be translated will reach the closest BR,
   reducing or eliminating sub-optimal traffic patterns, as well as
   providing high availability: Should one BR fail, the IGP will
   automatically redirect the traffic to the closest alternate BR.

4.6.  Location of the SIIT-DC Border Relays

   The goal of SIIT-DC is to facilitate a true IPv6-only application and
   network architecture, with the sole exception being the IPv4
   interfaces of the BRs and the network infrastructure required to
   connect the BRs to the IPv4 Internet.  Therefore, the BRs must be
   located somewhere between the IPv4 Internet and the application
   delivery stack - which includes all servers, load balancers,
   firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and similar devices that are
   processing traffic to a greater extent than merely forwarding it.

   It is optimal to place the BRs as close as possible to the direct
   path between the location of the IPv6 Service Address and the end
   users.  If the closest BR was located a long way from the direct
   path, all packets in both directions must make a detour in order to
   traverse the BR.  This would increase the RTT between the service and
   the end user by by two times the extra latency incurred by the
   detour, as well as cause unnecessary load on the network links on the
   detour path.

   Where possible, it is beneficial to implement the BRs as a logical
   function within the routers would have handled the traffic anyway,
   had the topology been dual stacked.  This way, a SIIT-DC deployment
   does not require separate networks ports (which might become
   saturated and impact the service quality), nor will it require extra
   rack space and energy.  Some particularly good choices of the
   location could be within an IDC's access routers, or within the
   Autonomous System's border routers.

   Finally, another possibility is that the IDC operator outsources the
   SIIT-DC service to another entity, for example his upstream ISP.
   Doing so allows the IDC operator to build a true IPv6-only
   infrastructure.

4.7.  Migration from Dual Stack

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   While this document mainly discusses the use of IPv6-only nodes and
   applications, it is important to note that SIIT-DC is fully
   compatible with dual stack infrastructures, including dual stack
   nodes and applications.

   Thus, migrating a dual-stacked service to an IPv6-only one where
   SIIT-DC provides the IPv4 Internet connectivity is easy.  The
   operator would start out by designating the service's current native
   IPv6 address as the IPv6 Service Address, and assign it a
   corresponding IPv4 Service Address.  At this point, the service will
   respond on both its old (native) IPv4 address, and the SIIT-DC IPv4
   Service Address.  The operator may now move traffic from the former
   to the latter by changing the service's "IN A" DNS record.  Once all
   IPv4 traffic has been successfully moved to SIIT-DC, the old IPv4
   address may be reclaimed.

4.8.  Translation of ICMPv6 Errors to IPv4

   In response to an IPv4 packet subsequently translated to IPv6 by the
   BR, an IPv6 router in the IDC network may need to transmit an ICMPv6
   error back to the origin IPv4 node.  By default, such an ICMPv6 error
   will most likely be discarded by the BR, unless the source address of
   the ICMPv6 error happens to be a IPv4-translatable IPv6 address or
   covered by an EAM.

   To facilitate reliable delivery of such ICMPv6 errors, an SIIT-DC
   operator SHOULD implement the recommendations in [RFC6791] in the
   BRs.

4.9.  MTU and Fragmentation

   There are some key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 relating to
   packet sizes and fragmentation that one MUST consider when deploying
   SIIT-DC.  They result in a few problematic corner cases, which can be
   dealt with in a few different ways.  The following subsections will
   discuss these in detail, and provide operational guidance.

   In particular, the operator may find that relying on fragmentation in
   the IPv6 domain is undesired or even operationally impossible
   [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop].  For this reason, the recommendations in
   this section seeks to minimise the use of IPv6 fragmentation.

   Unless otherwise stated, the following subsections assume that the
   MTU in both the IPv4 and IPv6 domains is 1500 bytes.

4.9.1.  IPv4/IPv6 Header Size Difference





Anderson                 Expires April 14, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   The IPv6 header is up to 20 bytes larger than the IPv4 header.  This
   means that a full-size 1500 bytes large IPv4 packet cannot be
   translated to IPv6 without being fragmented, otherwise it would
   likely have resulted in a 1520 bytes large IPv6 packet.

   If the transport protocol used is TCP, this is generally not a
   problem, the IPv6 node will advertise a TCP MSS of 1440 bytes during
   the initial TCP handshake.  This causes the IPv4 clients to never
   send larger packets than what can be translated to a single full-size
   IPv6 packet, eliminating any need for fragmentation.

   For other transport protocols, full-size IPv4 packets with the DF
   flag cleared will need to be fragmented by the BR.  This may be
   avoided by increasing the Path MTU between the BR and the IPv6 nodes
   to 1520 bytes or greater.  If this is done, the MTU on the IPv6 nodes
   themselves SHOULD NOT be increased accordingly, as doing so would
   cause them to undergo Path MTU Discovery for all destinations on the
   IPv6 Internet.  The nodes MUST however be able to accept and process
   incoming packets larger than their own MTU.  If the nodes' IPv6
   implementation allows the initial Path MTU to be set differently for
   specific destinations, it MAY be increased to 1520 for destinations
   within the Translation Prefix specifically.

4.9.2.  IPv6 Atomic Fragments

   In keeping with the fifth paragraph of Section 4 of [RFC6145], a
   stateless translator like a BR will by default add an IPv6
   Fragmentation header to the resulting IPv6 packet when translating an
   IPv4 packet with the Don't Fragment flag set to 0.  This happens even
   though the resulting IPv6 packet isn't actually fragmented into
   several pieces, resulting in an IPv6 Atomic Fragment [RFC6946].
   These Atomic Fragments are generally not useful in an IDC
   environment, and it is therefore recommended that this behaviour is
   disabled in the BRs.  To this end, Section 4 of [RFC6145] notes that
   the "translator MAY provide a configuration function that allows the
   translator not to include the Fragment Header for the non-fragmented
   IPv6 packets".

   Note that IPv6 Atomic Fragments are currently being deprecated by
   RFC6145bis [I-D.bao-v6ops-rfc6145bis].  As a result, a BR that
   conforms to the updated standard is required to behave as recommended
   above.

   In IPv6, the Identification value is located inside the Fragmentation
   header.  That means that if the generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments
   is disabled, the IPv4 Identification value will be lost during
   translation to IPv6.  This could potentially confuse some diagnostic
   tools.

4.9.3.  Minimum Path MTU Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6

   Section 5 of [RFC2460] specifies that the minimum IPv6 link MTU is
   1280 bytes.  Therefore, an IPv6 node can reasonably assume that if it
   transmits an IPv6 packet that is 1280 bytes or smaller, it is
   guaranteed to reach its destination without requiring fragmentation
   or invoking the Path MTU Discovery algorithm [RFC1981].  However,
   this assumption might prove false if the destination is an IPv4 node
   reached through a protocol translator such as a BR, as the minimum
   IPv4 link MTU is 68 bytes.  See Section 3.2 of [RFC0791].

   Section 5.1 of [RFC6145] specifies that a stateless translator should
   set the IPv4 Don't Fragment flag to 1 when it translates a non-
   fragmented IPv6 packet to IPv4.  This means that when the path to the
   destination IPv4 node contains an IPv4 link with an MTU smaller than
   1260 bytes (which corresponds to an IPv6 MTU smaller than 1280 bytes,
   cf. Section 4.9.1), the Path MTU Discovery algorithm will be invoked,
   even if the original IPv6 packet was only 1280 bytes large.  This
   happens as a result of the IPv4 router connecting to the IPv4 link
   with the small MTU returning an ICMPv4 Need To Fragment error with an
   MTU value smaller than 1260, which in turns is translated by the BR
   to an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error with an MTU value smaller than 1280
   which is then transmitted to the origin IPv6 node.

   When an IPv6 node receives an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error indicating
   an MTU value smaller than 1280, the last paragraph of Section 5 of
   [RFC2460] gives it two choices on how to proceed:

   o  It may reduce its Path MTU value to the value indicated in the
      Packet Too Big, i.e., limit the size of subsequent packets
      transmitted to that destination to the indicated value.  This
      approach causes no problems for the SIIT-DC function, as it simply
      allows Path MTU Discovery to work transparently across the BR.

   o  It may reduce its Path MTU value to exactly 1280, and in addition
      include a Fragmentation header in subsequent packets sent to that
      destination.  In other words, the IPv6 node will start emitting
      Atomic Fragments.  The Fragmentation header signals to the the BR
      that the Don't Fragment flag should be set to 0 in the resulting
      IPv4 packet, and it also provides the Identification value.

   If the use of the IPv6 Fragmentation header is problematic, and the
   operator has IPv6 nodes that implement the second option above, the
   operator should consider enabling the functionality described as the
   "second approach" in Section 6 of [RFC6145].  This functionality
   changes the BR's behaviour as follows:





Anderson                 Expires April 14, 2016                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   o  When translating ICMPv4 Need To Fragment to ICMPv6 Packet Too Big,
      the resulting packet will never contain an MTU value lower than
      1280.  This prevents the IPv6 nodes from generating Atomic
      Fragments.

   o  When translating IPv6 packets smaller than or equal to 1280 bytes,
      the Don't Fragment flag in the resulting IPv4 packet will be set
      to 0.  This ensures that in the eventuality that the path contains
      an IPv4 link with an MTU smaller than 1260, the IPv4 router
      connected to that link will have the responsibility to fragment
      the packet before forwarding it towards its destination.

   In summary, this approach could be seen as prompting the IPv4
   protocol itself to provide the "link-specific fragmentation and
   reassembly at a layer below IPv6" required for links that "cannot
   convey a 1280-octet packet in one piece", to paraphrase Section 5 of
   [RFC2460].

   Note that IPv6 Atomic Fragments are currently being deprecated by
   RFC6145bis [I-D.bao-v6ops-rfc6145bis].  As a result, a BR that
   conforms to the updated standard is required to behave as suggested
   above.

4.10.  IPv4-translatable IPv6 Service Addresses

   SIIT-DC is designed so that the IPv6 Service Addresses are not
   required to be IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-eam] discusses why it is desirable to avoid
   requiring the use of IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.

   It is however quite possible to deploy SIIT-DC in combination with
   IPv4-translatable IPv6 Service Addresses.  The primary benefits in
   doing so are:

   o  The operator is not required to provision EAMs for
      IPv4-translatable IPv6 Service Addresses onto the BR/ERs.

   o  [RFC6145] translation can be performed in a checksum-neutral
      manner, cf. Section 4.1 of [RFC6052].

   The trade-off is that the IPv4-translatable IPv6 Service Addresses
   must be configured on the IPv6 nodes, and the applications must be
   set up to use them - likely in addition to their primary (non-
   IPv4-translatable) IPv6 addresses.  The IPv4-translatable IPv6
   Service Addresses must also be routed from the BR through the IDC's
   IPv6 network infrastructure to the nodes on which they are assigned.
   This essentially requires the entire IPv6 infrastructure to be made
   aware of and handle translated IPv4 traffic as a special case, which

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


   significantly increases complexity.  As previously described in
   Section 1.1, avoiding such drawbacks is a design goal of SIIT-DC.
   The use of IPv4-translatable IPv6 Service Addresses is therefore
   discouraged.

   This draft makes no request of the IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Mistaking the Translation Prefix for a Trusted Network

   If a Network-Specific Prefix from the provider's own address space is
   chosen for the translation prefix, as recommended in Section 4.4,
   care MUST be taken if the translation service is used in front of
   services that have application-level ACLs that distinguish between
   the operator's own networks and the Internet at large, as traffic
   from translated IPv4 end users on the Internet might appear to be
   originating from the provider's own network.  It is therefore
   important that the translation prefix is treated the same as the
   Internet at large, rather than as a trusted network.

   In order to alleviate this problem, the operator may opt to use a
   Translation Prefix that is distinct from and not a subset of the IPv6
   prefixes used elsewhere in the network infrastructure.

   Single Stack IPv6 Operation

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                    October 2015


      As discussed in Section 1.1, SIIT-DC facilitates an IPv6-only IDC
      network infrastructure.  The only places where IPv4 is absolutely
      required is between the BRs and the IPv4 Internet, and between any
      ERs and the IPv4-only applications or devices they are serving
      (illustrated here as the two tenants' FTP servers).  The figure
      also illustrates how SIIT-DC does not interfere with native IPv6;
      when there is no longer a need to support IPv4 clients, the BRs
      may be decommissioned without causing any impact to native IPv6
      traffic.

   Stateless Operation
      As discussed in Section 1.2, SIIT-DC operates in a stateless
      fashion.  In the illustration, both BRs are simultaneously
      advertising (i.e., anycasting) the IPv4 Service Address Pool and
      the IPv6 Translation Prefix, so incoming traffic from the IPv4
      Internet may arrive at either of the BRs, while outgoing IPv6
      traffic destined for IPv4 endpoints are load balanced between them
      using Equal-Cost Multipath Routing.  No continuous state
      synchronisation between the two BRs occurs.  Should one of the BRs
      fail, the BGP and OSPF protocols will ensure that traffic
      converges on the remaining BR.  Existing sessions will not be
      disrupted, beyond any disruption caused by the BGP/OSPF
      convergence process itself.

   IPv4 Address Conservation
      As discussed in Section 1.3, SIIT-DC conserves the IDC operator's
      IPv4 address space.  Even though the two customers in the example
      above have several hundred servers, the majority of them are not
      used to run services made available directly from the Internet,
      and therefore do not need to consume IPv4 addresses.  The IDC
      network infrastructure consumes no IPv4 addresses, either.
      Finally, the IPv4 addresses that are assigned to the SIIT-DC
      function as IPv4 Service Address Pools may assigned with 100%
      efficiency, one address at a time; there is no requirement to
      assign multiple addresses to a single customer in a contiguous
      block.

   Application support
      As discussed in Section 1.5, as long as the application protocol
      is translation-friendly (illustrated here with HTTP and SMTP), it
      will work with SIIT-DC without requiring any special adaptation.
      Furthermore, translation-unfriendly applications (illustrated here
      with FTP) will also work when located behind an ER
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].  Tenant A's FTP server illustrates
      how an ER may be located in the networking stack of a node, while
      Tenant B's FTP server illustrates how the ER may be deployed as a
      network service.  The latter approach enables SIIT-DC to support
      IPv4-only nodes/devices.
