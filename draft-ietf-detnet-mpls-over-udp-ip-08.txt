1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by
   a network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows extremely low
   packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
   General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in [RFC8655].

   To carry DetNet MPLS flows with full functionality at the DetNet
   layer over an IP network, the following components are required
   (these are a subset of the requirements for MPLS encapsulation listed
   in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls]):

   1.  A method for identifying DetNet flows to the processing element.

   2.  A method for carrying the DetNet sequence number.

   3.  A method for distinguishing DetNet OAM packets from DetNet data
       packets.

   4.  A method for carrying queueing and forwarding indication.

   These requirements are satisfied by the DetNet over MPLS
   Encapsulation described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and they are partly

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP           December 2020


   satisfied (i.e., IP flows can be identified however no DetNet
   sequence number is carried) by the DetNet IP data plane defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip]

   This document specifies use of the MPLS DetNet encapsulation over an
   IP network.  The approach is modeled on the operation of MPLS over an
   IP Packet Switched Network (PSN) [RFC7510].  It maps the MPLS data
   plane encapsulation described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] to the DetNet
   IP data plane defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   As specified in [RFC7510]: "MPLS-in-UDP MUST NOT be used over the
   general Internet, or over non-cooperating network operators, to carry
   traffic that is not congestion controlled."  This does apply to
   DetNet networks as this document focuses on solutions for networks
   that are under a single administrative control or within a closed
   group of administrative control.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Terms Used in This Document

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   architecture [RFC8655], and the reader is assumed to be familiar with
   that document and its terminology.

2.2.  Abbreviations

   The following abbreviations are used in this document:

   d-CW          A DetNet Control Word (d-CW) is used for sequencing and
                 identifying duplicate packets of a DetNet flow at the
                 DetNet service sub-layer.

   DetNet        Deterministic Networking.

   A-Label       A special case of an S-Label, whose properties are
                 known only at the aggregation and deaggregation end-
                 points.

   F-Label       A Detnet "forwarding" label that identifies the LSP
                 used to forward a DetNet flow across an MPLS PSN, e.g.,
                 a hop-by-hop label used between label switching
                 routers.

   MPLS          Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   OAM           Operations, Administration, and Maintenance.

   PEF           Packet Elimination Function.

   POF           Packet Ordering Function.

   PREOF         Packet Replication, Elimination and Ordering Functions.

   PRF           Packet Replication Function.

   PSN           Packet Switched Network.

   S-Label       A DetNet "service" label that is used between DetNet
                 nodes that also implement the DetNet service sub-layer
                 functions.  An S-Label is also used to identify a
                 DetNet flow at DetNet service sub-layer.

2.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  DetNet MPLS Operation over DetNet IP PSNs

   This document builds on the specification of MPLS over UDP defined in
   [RFC7510].  It may replace partly or entirely the F-Label(s) used in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] with UDP and IP headers.  The UDP and IP
   header information is used to identify DetNet flows, including member
   flows, per [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  The resulting encapsulation is
   shown in Figure 1.  There may be zero or more F-label(s) between the
   S-label and the UDP header.

   Note that this encapsulation works equally well with IPv4, IPv6, and
   IPv6-based Segment Routing [RFC8754].

               Figure 1: UDP/IP Encapsulation of DetNet MPLS

   S-Labels, A-Labels (when present), d-CW and zero or more F-Labels are
   used as defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and are not modified by
   this document.

4.  DetNet Data Plane Procedures

   To support outgoing DetNet MPLS over UDP encapsulation, an
   implementation MUST support the provisioning of UDP and IP header
   information in addition to or in place of F-Label(s).  Note, when PRF
   is performed at the MPLS service sub-layer, there will be multiple
   member flows, and each member flow will require the provisioning of
   their own UDP and IP header information.  The headers for each
   outgoing packet MUST be formatted according to the configuration
   information and as defined in [RFC7510], and the UDP Source Port
   value MUST be set to uniquely identify the DetNet flow.  The packet
   MUST then be handled as a DetNet IP packet, per [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].
   This includes QoS related traffic treatment.

   To support the receive processing defined in this document, an
   implementation MUST also support the provisioning of received UDP and
   IP header information.  The provisioned information MUST be used to
   identify incoming app-flows based on the combination of S-Label and
   incoming encapsulation header information.  Normal receive processing

   as defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls], including PEF and POF, can then
   take place.

5.  Management and Control Information Summary

   The following summarizes the minimum set of information that is
   needed to configure DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP:

   o  Label information (A-labels, S-labels and F-labels) to be mapped
      to UDP/IP flows.  Note that for example, a single S-Label can map
      to multiple sets of UDP/IP information when PREOF is used.

   o  IPv4 or IPv6 source address field.

   o  IPv4 or IPv6 destination address field.

   o  DSCP Field in either IPv4 Type of Service or IPv6 Traffic Class
      Fields.

   o  UDP Source Port.

   o  UDP Destination Port.

   o  Use/non-use of UDP checksum.

   This information MUST be provisioned per DetNet flow via
   configuration, e.g., via the controller [RFC8655] or management
   plane.  Not using the UDP checksum has to be evaluated on a case-by-
   case basis for a given network scenario based on the exception
   criteria's defined in [RFC7510], particularly when IPv6 is used.

   It is the responsibility of the DetNet controller plane to properly
   provision both flow identification information and the flow specific
   resources needed to provide the traffic treatment needed to meet each
   flow's service requirements.  This applies for aggregated and
   individual flows.

   Note: In the presence of network (and port) address translation
   devices/functions it would be up to the controller plane to determine
   the appropriate information to ensure proper mapping at the sender/
   receiver.

6.  Security Considerations

   The solution defined in this document reuses mechanisms specified in
   other documents, and the security considerations in those documents
   apply equally to this document.  Of particular note is [RFC7510], as
   this document is primarily an application of MPLS-in-UDP.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP           December 2020


   Additionally, the security considerations of DetNet in general are
   discussed in [RFC8655] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-security].  Finally, MPLS
   and IP specific security considerations are described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  This draft does not
   have additional security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations
