                 SACM Vulnerability Assessment Scenario
                   draft-coffin-sacm-vuln-scenario-01

Abstract

   This document provides a core narrative that walks through an
   automated enterprise vulnerability assessment scenario.  It is
   aligned with the SACM use cases and begins with an enterprise
   ingesting vulnerability description data, followed by identifying
   endpoints on the network and collecting and storing information about
   them to enable posture assessment, and finally ends with assessing
   these endpoints against the vulnerability description data to
   determine which ones are affected.  Processes that specifically
   overlap between this scenario and SACM use cases will be noted where
   applicable.  Specifically, the relationship between this document and
   the SACM use case building block capabilities and the usage scenarios
   will be covered.

1.  Scope

   The purpose of this document is to describe a detailed scenario for
   vulnerability assessment, and identify aspects of this scenario that
   could be used in the development of an information model.  This
   includes classes of data, major roles, and a high-level description
   of role interactions.  Additionally, this scenario intends to inform
   engineering work on protocol and data model development.  The focus
   of the document is entirely intra-organizational and covers
   enterprise handling of vulnerability description data.  The document
   does not attempt to cover the security disclosure itself and any
   prior activities of the security researcher or discloser, nor does it
   attempt to cover the specific activities of the vendor whose software
   is the focus of the vulnerability description data (i.e., the
   vulnerable software).

   For the purposes of this document, the term "vulnerability
   description data" is intended to mean: "Data intended to alert
   enterprise IT resources to the existence of a flaw or flaws in
   software, hardware, and/or firmware, which could potentially have an
   impact on enterprise functionality and/or security."  For the purpose
   of this scenario, such data also includes information that can be
   used to determine (to some level of accuracy, although possibly not
   conclusively) whether or not the flaw is present within an
   enterprise, when compared to information about the state of the
   enterprise's endpoints.  For those who are familiar with current
   security practices and terminology, the use of vulnerability
   description data is also synonymnous with security bulletin or
   advisory.

   This document makes no attempt to provide a definition of a
   normalized data format (e.g.  industry standard) for vulnerability
   description data although there is nothing precluding the development
   of such a normalized data format.  Also, it does not attempt to
   define procedures by which a vulnerability discoverer coordinates the
   release of vulnerability description data to other parties.

2.  Assumptions

   A number of assumptions must be stated in order to further clarify
   the position and scope of this document.

   o  The document begins with the assumption that the enterprise has
      received vulnerability description data, and that the data has
      already been processed into a format that the enterprise's
      security software tools can understand and use.  In particular,
      this document:

      *  Does not discuss how the enterprise identifies potentially
         relevant vulnerability description data.

      *  Does not discuss how the enterprise collects the vulnerability
         description data.

      *  Does not discuss how the enterprise assesses the authenticity
         of the vulnerability description data.

      *  Does not discuss parsing of the vulnerability description data
         into a usable format.

   o  The document assumes that the enterprise has a means of
      identifying enterprise endpoints.  This could mean identifying
      endpoints as they join the network, actively scanning for
      connected endpoints, passive scanning of network traffic to
      identify connected endpoints, or some other method of accounting
      for the presence of all endpoints in the enterprise.  The document
      also does not distinguish between physical endpoints and
      virtualized endpoints.

   o  The document assumes that the enterprise has a means of extracting
      relevant information about enterprise endpoints.  Moreover, this
      extracted information is expressed in a format that is compatible
      with the information extracted from the vulnerability description
      data.  The document:

      *  Does not specify how relevant information is identified.

      *  Does not specify the mechanics of how relevant information is
         extracted from the data sources (such as the endpoint itself).

      *  Does not specify how extracted endpoint information and
         vulnerability description data is normalized to be compatible.

      Note that having a means of extracting relevant information about
      enterprise endpoints is within the scope of the SACM Endpoint



Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


      Security Posture Assessment process.  In the case of this
      document, this sub-process is assumed to be existent.

   o  The document assumes that all information described in the steps
      below is available in the vulnerability description data and
      serves as the basis of this assessment.  Likewise, the document
      assumes that the enterprise can provide all relevant information
      about any endpoint needed to perform the described analysis.  The
      authors recognize that this will not always be the case, but these
      assumptions are taken in order to show the breadth of data
      utilization in this scenario.  Less complete information may
      require variations to the described steps.

   o  The document assumes that the enterprise has a policy by which
      assessment of endpoints based on vulnerability description data is
      prioritized.  The document:

      *  Does not specify how prioritization occurs.

      *  Does not specify how prioritization impacts assessment
         behaviors.

   o  The document assumes that the enterprise has a mechanism for long-
      term storage of vulnerability description data and endpoint
      assessment results (e.g., a data repository).

   o  This document assumes that the enterprise has a procedure for
      reassessment of endpoints at some point after initial assessment.
      The document:

      *  Does not specify how a reassessment would impact individual
         assessment behaviors.  (i.e., it is agnostic as to whether the
         assessment procedure is the same regardless of whether this is
         the first or a subsequent assessment for some set of
         vulnerability description data.)

      *  Does not provide recommendations or specifics on reassessment
         intervals.

3.  Endpoint Identification and Initial (Pre-Assessment) Data Collection

   The first step in this scenario involves identifying endpoints and
   collecting the basic or minumum set of system information attributes
   from them such as operating system type and version.  Further
   examples of system information and attributes can be found below in
   the section titled Endpoint Data Collection.  This identification
   occurs prior to the receipt of any specific vulnerability description
   data and is part of the regular, ongoing monitoring of endpoints



Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   within an enterprise.  This process is not meant to report on, or
   gather data for any specific vulnerabilities.  The information
   gathered during this step could be applied in many enterprise
   automation efforts.  Specifically, in addition to vulnerability
   management, it could be used by configuration and license management
   tasks.  All of the information collected during this step is stored
   in a central location such as a Repository.

   This activity involves the following sub-steps:

3.1.  Identification

   Prior to any other steps, the identification of endpoints must occur.
   This involves locating (at least virtually) and distinguishing
   between endpoints on the network in a way that allows each endpoint
   to be recognized in future interactions and selected for specific
   treatment.  This not only allows later steps to determine the scope
   of what endpoints need to be assessed, but also allows for the unique
   identification of each endpoint.  Unique and persistent endpoint IDs
   are used to allow for endpoints to be tracked over time and between
   sensors as well as allow for proper counts of assets during
   inventories and other similar collections.  Endpoint identity can be
   established by collecting certain attributes that allow for unique
   and persistent tracking of endpoints on the enterprise network.
   Examples include, but are not limited to, IP address, MAC address,
   FQDNs, pre-provisioned identifiers such as GUIDs or copies of serial
   numbers, certificates, hardware identity values, or similar
   attributes.  It is important to note that the persistency of these
   attributes will likely vary depending on the enterprise.  For
   example, a statically assigned IP address is much more persistent
   than an IP address assigned via DHCP.

3.1.1.  SACM Use Case Alignment

   This sub-step aligns with the Endpoint Discovery, Endpoint
   Characterization, and Endpoint Target Identification building block
   capabilities.  The alignment is due to the fact that the purpose of
   this sub-step is to discover, identify, and characterize all
   endpoints on an enterprise network.

3.2.  Processing Artifacts

   Processing artifacts, such as the date and time the collection was
   performed, should be collected and stored.  This timestamp is
   extremely important when performing later assessments, as it is
   needed for data freshness computations.  The organization may develop
   rules for stale data and when a new data collection is required.
   This metadata is also helpful in correlating information across



Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   multiple data collections.  This includes correlating both pre-
   assessment data and secondary assessment data (sections 4.3 Endpoint
   Data Collection and 6.2 Secondary Assessment).

3.3.  Endpoint Data Collection

   The enterprise should perform ongoing collection of basic endpoint
   information such as operating system and version information, and an
   installed software inventory.  This information is collected for
   general system monitoring as well as its potential use in activities
   such as vulnerability assessment.

   Some examples of basic information to collect about endpoints in this
   pre-assessment process could include:

   o  Endpoint type - traditional (e.g., workstation, server, etc.)
      network infrastructure (e.g., switches, routers, etc.), mobile
      (e.g., cell phones, tablets, laptops, etc.), and constrained
      (e.g., industrial control systems, Internet of Things, etc.)

   o  Hardware version/firmware - e.g., BIOS version, firmware revision,
      etc.

   o  Operating system - e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android

   o  Operating system attributes - e.g., version, patch level, service
      pack level, internationalized or localized version, etc.

   o  Installed software inventory - Would include the software names
      and versions and possibly other high-level attributes.  Could be
      used to quickly determine endpoint applicability when new
      vulnerability description data arrives.

   Some additional and more advanced information to collect from
   endpoints in this pre-assessment process could include:

   o  Open ports and enabled services - This would include applications
      listening for incoming connections on open ports as well as
      services that are starting, running, suspended, or enabled to run
      pending some event.

   o  Operating system optional component inventory - some OS' have
      optional components that can be installed which may not show up as
      separate pieces of software (e.g., web and ftp servers, demo web
      pages, shared libraries, etc.).  Note that this could also occur
      within third-party applications as well.





Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   o  Endpoint location - physical location (e.g., department, room,
      Global Positioning System (GPS), etc.), logical location (e.g.,
      what network infrastructure endpoints (e.g.  switches, wireless
      access point, etc.) an endpoint is connected to, etc.

   o  Purpose - describes how the endpoint is used within the enterprise
      (e.g., end-user system, database server, public web server, etc.)

   o  Criticality - enterprise defined rating (possibly a score) that
      helps determine the criticality of the endpoint.  If this endpoint
      is attacked or lost, what is the impact to the overall enterprise?

   It is important to note that some of these attributes may exist
   natively on the endpoint whereas other attributes may be assigned by
   a human, computed, or derived from other data and may or may not be
   available for collection on the endpoint.

   Furthermore, the possibility should be left open for enterprises to
   define their own custom queries and algorithms to gather and derive
   enterprise-specific attributes that are deemed of interest to regular
   enterprise operations.

   In addition to collecting these attributes, metadata about the
   attributes should also be collected which could include:

      Data origin - where the data originated from

      Data source - what provided the data

      Date and time of collection - when the data was collected

3.3.1.  SACM Use Case Alignment

   This sub-step aligns with the Data Publication building block
   capability because this section involves storage of endpoint
   attributes within an enterprise Repository.  This sub-step also
   aligns with the Endpoint Characterization and Endpoint Target
   Identification building block capabilities because it further
   characterizes the endpoint through automated and possibly manual
   means.  There is direct alignment with the Endpoint Component
   Inventory, Posture Attribute Identification, and Posture Attribute
   Value Collection building block capabilities since the purpose of
   this sub-step is to perform an initial inventory of the endpoint and
   collect basic attributes and their values.  Last, there is alignment
   with the Collection Guidance Acquisition building block capabilities
   as the inventory and collection of endpoint attributes would be
   directed by some type of enterprise or third-party guidance.

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


3.4.  Implementation Examples

   Within the SACM Architecture, the Internal and External Collector
   components could be used to allow enterprises to collect posture
   attributes that demonstrate compliance with enterprise policy.
   Endpoints can be required to provide posture attributes, which may
   include identification attributes to enable persistent
   communications.

   The SWID Message and Attributes for IF-M standard defines collection
   and validation of software identities using the ISO Software
   Identification Tag Standard.  Using this standard, the identity of
   all installed software including the endpoint operating system, could
   be collected and used for later assessment.

   The OVAL Definitions Model provides a data model that can be used to
   specify what posture attributes to collect as well as their expected
   values which can be used to drive an assessment.

   The OVAL System Characteristics Model can be used to capture
   information about an endpoint.  The model is specifically suited to
   expressing OS information, endpoint identification information (such
   as IP and MAC addresses), and other endpoint metadata.

4.  Vulnerability Description Data

   The next step in the Vulnerability Assessment scenario begins after
   vulnerability description data has been received and processed into a
   form that can be used in the assessment of the enterprise.  As a part
   of the enterprise process for managing vulnerability description
   data, the enterprise should store all received and processed
   vulnerability description data in a Repository.  The stored
   vulnerability description data can be used and compared with later
   vulnerability description data for the purpose of duplicate detection
   and in some cases, guidance on how to handle similar issues.

   All vulnerability description data should be assigned an internal
   tracking ID by the enterprise as a first step as this helps
   compensate for the fact that incoming vulnerability description data
   might not have a global identifier when it is received, and might
   never be assigned one.

   High-level vulnerability description data metadata to store would
   include:

   o  Ingest date and time - the date and time that the vulnerability
      description data was received by the enterprise.




Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   o  Date and time of vulnerability description data release (i.e.,
      publication or disclosure date and time) - Some older
      vulnerability description data may be ingested long after
      publication.  This can be useful when reviewing historical
      enterprise information to (potentially) identify the period when a
      particular endpoint was first assessed as vulnerable.  Sometimes
      this information will help to differentiate between similar
      vulnerability description data.

   o  Version - the version or iteration of the vulnerability
      description data according to the author, if applicable.

   o  External Vulnerability Description Data ID(s) (if applicable) -
      any external or third-party IDs assigned to the vulnerability
      description data should be tracked.  There could be multiple IDs
      in some cases (e.g., vendor bug id, global ID, discoverer's local
      ID, third-party vulnerability database ID, etc.).

   o  Severity Score (if available) - these may be useful for later
      mitigation prioritization.

   In addition to the described metadata, the raw or original
   vulnerability description data would be stored along with the
   specific information extracted from it that is to be used in the
   applicability and assessment process.

4.1.  SACM Use Case Alignment

   This step aligns with the Data Publication and Data Retrieval
   building block capabilities because this section details storage of
   vulnerability description data within an enterprise Repository and
   later retrieval of the same.

4.2.  Implementation Examples

   The Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) is an XML-based
   language that attempts to standardize the creation of vulnerability
   report documentation.  Using CVRF, the enterprise could create
   automated tools based on the standardized schema which would obtain
   the needed and relevant information useful for later assessments and
   assessment results.

5.  Endpoint Applicability and Assessment

   When new vulnerability description data is received by the
   enterprise, applicable enterprise endpoints must be identified and
   assessed.  Endpoints are first examined using the already obtained
   pre-assessment data.  If this is not sufficient to determine endpoint



Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   applicability, a secondary data collection for additional data and
   attributes may be performed to determine status with regard to the
   vulnerability description data.

5.1.  Applicability

   The applicability of an endpoint and its vulnerability status can, in
   many cases, be determined entirely by the existence of a particular
   version of installed software on the endpoint.  This data may have
   been collected in the pre-assessment data collection.  If the
   applicability and vulnerability status of an endpoint can be
   determined entirely by the pre-collected data attribute set, no
   further data collection is required.

   Other cases may require specific data (i.e., file system attributes,
   specific configuration parameters, etc.) to be collected for the
   assessment of a particular vulnerability description data.  In these
   cases, a secondary, targeted vulnerability assessment is required.
   Administrators may want to evaluate applicability to the
   vulnerability description data iteratively.  Specifically, the
   process would compare against pre-collected data first (easy to do
   and the data is stored in a Repository), and then if needed, query
   endpoints that are not already excluded from applicability for
   additional required data.  (I.e., A "fast-fail" model).  To do this,
   the criteria for determining applicability must be separable, so that
   some conclusions can be drawn based on the possession of partial
   data.

5.1.1.  SACM Use Case Alignment

   This sub-step aligns with the Data Retrieval, Data Query, and Posture
   Attribute Value Query building block capabilities because, in this
   sub-step, the process is attempting to determine the vulnerability
   status of the endpoint using the data that has previously been
   collected.

5.2.  Secondary Assessment

   If the applicability and vulnerability status of an endpoint cannot
   be determined by the pre-assessment data collection, a secondary and
   targeted assessment of the endpoint will be required.  A secondary
   assessment may also be required in the case that data on-hand (either
   from pre-assessment or from prior secondary assessments) is stale or
   out-of-date.

   The following data types and attributes are examples of what might be
   required in the case of a secondary and targeted assessment:

   o  Specific files and attributes - i.e., file name, versions, size,
      write date, modified date, checksum, etc.  Some vulnerabilities
      may only be distinguishable through the presence or absence of
      specific files or their attributes.

   o  Shared libraries - Some vulnerabilities will affect many products
      across multiple vendors.  In these cases the vulnerability may
      apply to a shared library.  Under these circumstances, product
      versions may be less helpful than looking for the presence of one
      or more specific files and their attributes.

   o  Other software configuration information (if applicable) - e.g.,
      Microsoft Windows registry queries, Apple configuration profiles,
      GConf, Proc filesystem, text configuration files and their
      parameters, and the installation paths.  Sometimes vulnerabilities
      only affect certain software configurations and in some cases
      these are not the default configurations.  Certain configuration
      attributes can be used to determine the current configuration
      state.

   Note that the secondary assessment described here does not need to be
   a pull assessment that is initiated by the server.  The secondary
   assessment could also be part of a push to the server when the
   endpoint detects a change to a vulnerability assessment baseline.

5.2.1.  SACM Use Case Alignment

   This sub-step aligns with the Data Publication building block
   capability because this section details storage of endpoint
   attributes within an enterprise Repository.  The sub-step also aligns
   with the Collection Guidance Acquisition building block capability
   since the vulnerability description data (guidance) drives the
   collection of additional endpoint attributes.

   This sub-step aligns with the Endpoint Characterization (both manual
   and automated) and Endpoint Target Identification building block
   capabilities because it could further characterize the endpoint
   through automated and possibly manual means.  There is direct
   alignment with the Endpoint Component Inventory, Posture Attribute
   Identification, and Posture Attribute Value Collection building block
   capabilities since the purpose of this sub-step is to perform
   additional and more specific component inventories and collections of
   endpoint attributes and their values.

5.3.  Implementation Examples

   Within the SACM Architecture, the assessment task would be handled by
   the Evaluator component.  If pre-assessment data is used, this would
   be stored on and obtained from a Data Store component.

   Within the SACM Architecture, the Internal and External Collector
   components could be used to allow enterprises to collect posture
   attributes that demonstrate compliance with enterprise policy.
   Endpoints can be required to provide posture attributes, which may
   include identification attributes to enable persistent
   communications.

   The SWID Message and Attributes for IF-M standard defines collection
   and validation of software identities using the ISO Software
   Identification Tag Standard.  Using this standard, all installed
   software including the endpoint operating system could be collected
   and stored for later assessment.

   The OVAL Definitions Model provides a data model that can be used to
   specify what posture attributes to collect as well as their expected
   values which can be used to drive an assessment.

   The OVAL System Characteristics Model can be used to capture
   information about an endpoint.  The model is specifically suited to
   expressing OS information, endpoint identification information (such
   as IP and MAC addresses), and other endpoint metadata.

   The SACM Internal and External Attribute Collector components can be
   used to allow enterprises to collect posture attributes that
   demonstrate compliance with enterprise policy.  Endpoints can be
   required to provide posture attributes, which may include
   identification attributes to enable persistent communications.

6.  Assessment Results

   Assessment results present the results of an assessment, along with
   sufficient context so a human or machine can make the appropriate
   response.  This context might include a description of the issue
   provided by the vulnerability description data, the endpoint
   attributes that indicate applicability, or other information needed
   to respond to the results of the assessment.  Data in this step is
   stored for auditing and forensic purposes.

   The following details are important to track in assessment results.
   Note that information may be "included" by providing pointers to
   other records stored in a Repository (e.g., vulnerability description
   data, endpoint data, etc.).

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   o  Date and time of assessment - The date and time that the
      assessment was performed.  To understand when the data was
      compared against the vulnerability description data and what
      conclusions were drawn.

   o  Data collection/attribute age - The age of the data used in the
      assessment to make the endpoint status determination.

   o  Endpoint ID - The endpoint itself must be identified for tracking
      results over time.

   o  Vulnerability description data ID(s) - May include both the
      internally defined ID as well as one or more externally defined
      IDs if they exist.  The internally assigned ID allows linkage to
      the correct vulnerability description data.  If available,
      external IDs provide a "pivot point" to additional external
      information.

   o  Vulnerable software product(s) - Identifies the software products
      on the endpoint that resulted in the endpoint being declared
      applicable.  Since some vulnerability description data identify
      vulnerabilities in multiple products, this will help identify the
      specific product (or products) found to be vulnerable in the
      endpoint assessment.

   o  Endpoint vulnerability status - The endpoint status based on the
      vulnerability description data.  Does the vulnerability exist on
      the endpoint?

   o  Vulnerability description - Not needed for automated assessment
      but probably should be included for human review.  The reason for
      inclusion is to support the human user understanding of the
      vulnerability assessment results within the application front-end
      or interface.

   o  Vulnerability remediation - Similar to the above, remediation or
      vendor patch information would be useful for a human response.  In
      many cases, this information may be a part of the description
      information described above.  Note that patch information may
      change over time due to supercession of the vendor patches.

6.1.  SACM Use Case Alignment

   This step aligns with the Data Publication and Data Retrieval
   building block capabilities because this section details storage of
   vulnerability assessment results within an enterprise Repository and
   later retrieval of the same.

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


6.2.  Implementation Examples

   The OVAL Results Model provides a data model to encode the results of
   the assessment, which could then be stored in a Repository and later
   accessed.  The assessment results described in this scenario could be
   stored and later accessed using the OVAL Results Model.  Note that
   the use of the OVAL Results Model for sharing results is not
   recommended per section 7.3 of the OVAL and the SACM Information
   Model [draft-hansbury-sacm-oval-info-model-mapping-01].

   Within the SACM Architecture, the generation of the assessment
   results would occur in the Report Generator component.  Those results
   might then be moved to a Data Store component for later sharing and
   retrieval as defined by SACM.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document provides a core narrative that walks through an
   automated enterprise vulnerability assessment scenario and is aligned
   with SACM "Endpoint Security Posture Assessment: Enterprise Use
   Cases" [RFC7632].  As a result, the security considerations for
   [RFC7632] apply to this document.  Furthermore, the vulnerability
   description data may provide attackers with useful information such
   as what software an enterprise is running on their endpoints.  As a
   result, organizations should properly protect the vulnerability
   description data it ingests.***TODO IS THIS COVERED BY RFC7632???***

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  Changes in Revision 01

   Clarification of the vulnerability description data IDs in sections 4
   and 6.

   Added "vulnerability remediation" to the Assessment Results and Data
   Attribute Table and Definitions sections.

   Added Implementation Examples to Endpoint Identification and Initial
   (Pre-Assessment) Data Collection, Vulnerability Description Data,
   Endpoint Applicability and Assessment, and Assessment Results
   sections.

   Added an example to vulnerability description data in the scope
   section.

   Added a sentence to clarify vulnerability description data definition
   in the scope section.

   Added data repository example for long-term storage scope item.

   Added sentence to direct reader to examples of basic system
   information in endpoint identification section.

   Split the examples of information to collect in the pre-assessment
   collection section into a basic and advanced list.

   Added examples of data stored in the repository in the Assessment
   Results section.

   Added sentence for human-assigned attributes in the Future Work
   section.

   Replaced "vulnerability report" to "vulnerability description data"
   because the term report was causing confusion.  Similarly, replaced
   "assessment report" with "assessment results".

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   Replaced "Configuration Management Database (CMDB)" with "Repository"
   which is SACM's term for a data store.

   Replaced endpoint "Role" with "Purpose" because "Role" is already
   defined in SACM.  Also, removed "Function" because it too is already
   defined in SACM.

   Clarified that the document does not try to define a normalized data
   format for vulnerability description data although it does not
   preclude the creation of such a format.

   Included additional examples of software configuration information.

   Clarified the section around endpoint identification to make it clear
   designation attributes used to correlate and identify endoints are
   both persistent and unique.  Furthermore, text was added to explain
   how the persistency of attributes may vary.  This was based on
   knowledge gained from the Endpoint ID Design Team.

   Updated the Security Considerations section to mention those
   described in [RFC7632].

   Removed text around Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).  While important,
   BYOD just adds complexity to this initial draft.  BYOD should be
   addressed in a later revision.

   Merged the list of "basic endpoint information" and the list of
   "human-assigned endpoint attributes" as both represent data we want
   to collect about an endpoint.  Whether or not that data is natively
   available on the endpoint for collection or assigned by a human,
   computed, or derived from other data which may or may not be
   available on the endpoint for collection seems arbitrary.  With this
   scenario, we primarily care about expressing information needs rather
   than how the information is collected or from where.

Appendix B.  Continuous Vulnerability Assessment

   It is not sufficient to perform a single assessment when
   vulnerability description data is published without any further
   checking.  Doing so does not address the possibility that the
   reported vulnerability might be introduced to the enterprise
   environment after the intial assessment completes.  For example, new
   endpoints can be introduced to the environment which have old
   software or are not up-to-date with patches.  Another example is
   where unauthorized or obsolete software is installed on an existing
   endpoint by enterprise users after vulnerability description data and
   initial assessment has taken place.  Moreover, enterprises might not
   wish to, or be able to, assess all vulnerability description data



Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   immediately when they come in.  Conflicts with other critical
   activities or limited resources might mean that some alerts,
   especially those that the enterprise deems as "low priority", are not
   used to guide enterprise assessments until sometime after the initial
   receipt.

   The scenario above describes a single assessment of endpoints.
   However, it does not make any assumptions as to when this assessment
   occurs relative to the original receipt of the vulnerability
   description data that led to this assessment.  The assessment could
   immediately follow ingest of the vulnerability description data,
   could be delayed, or the assessment might represent a reassessment of
   some vulnerability description data against which endpoints had
   previously been assessed.  Moreover, the scenario incorporates long-
   term storage of collected data, vulnerability description data, and
   assessment results in order to facilitate meaningful and ongoing
   reassessment.

Appendix C.  Priority

   Priorities associated with the vulnerability description data,
   assessment results, and any remedy is important, but is treated as a
   separate challenge and, as such, has not been integrated into the
   description of this scenario.  Nevertheless, it is important to point
   out and describe the use of priorities in the overall vulnerability
   description data scenario as they separable issues with their own
   sets of requirements.

   Priority in regard to vulnerability description data, can be viewed
   in a couple of different ways within an enterprise.  The assessment
   prioritization involves prioritization of the vulnerability
   description data assessment process.  This determines what
   vulnerability description data is assessed, and in what order it is
   assessed in.  For instance, a vulnerability affecting an operating
   system or application used throughout the enterprise would likely be
   prioritized higher than a vulnerability in an application which is
   used only on a few, low-criticality endpoints.

   The prioritization of remedies relates to the enterprise remediation
   and mitigation process based on the discovered vulnerabilities.  Once
   an assessment has been performed and applicable endpoints identified,
   enterprise vulnerability managers must determine where to focus their
   efforts to apply appropriate remedies.  For example, a vulnerability
   that is easily exploitable and which can allow arbitrary code
   execution might be remedied before a vulnerability that is more
   difficult to exploit or which just degrades performance.





Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   Some vulnerability description data include severities and/or other
   information that places the vulnerability in context.  This
   information can be used in both of the priority types discussed
   above.  In other cases, enterprise administrators may need to
   prioritize based only on what they know about their enterprise and
   the description provided in the vulnerability description data.

   Examples of data attributes specific to priority of assessments and/
   or remedies include (but not limited to) the following:

   o  Enterprise - defined purpose of the device, criticality of the
      device, exposure of the device, etc.

   o  Severity attributes - A rating or score that attempts to provide
      the level of severity or criticality associated with a given
      vulnerability.

   o  Cyber threat intelligence - information such as tactics,
      techniques, and procedures of threat actors, indicators of
      compromise, incidents, courses of action, etc. that help the
      enterprise understand relevant threats and how to detect,
      mitigate, or respond to them.

               Table 1: Vulnerability Assessment Attributes

D.2.  Definitions

   Endpoint

   o  Collection date/time - the date and time of data collection

   o  Endpoint type - the device type of the endpoint (e.g., standard
      computer, printer, router, mobile device, tablet, etc.)

   o  Hardware version/firmware - the hardware or firmware version if
      applicable (e.g., BIOS version, firmware revision, etc.)

   o  Operating system - Operating system name

   o  Operating system attributes - Operating system high-level
      attributes (e.g., version, service pack level, edition, etc.).
      Would not include configuration details.

   o  Installed software name - List of all installed software packages
      (i.e., software inventory).  May or may not include software
      installed by the operating system.

   o  Installed software attributes - Software high-level attributes
      (e.g., version, patch level, install path, etc.).  Would not
      include configuration details.

   o  Open ports/enabled services - Listening network ports (e.g., TCP,
      UDP, etc.) as well as services that are starting, running,
      suspended, or enabled to run pending some event.

   o  Operating system optional component inventory - Operating system
      specific components and software (when NOT already included in the
      general software inventory)

   o  Location - The physical location of an enterprise endpoint (e.g.,
      department, room, etc.)

   o  Purpose - describes how the endpoint is used within the enterprise
      (e.g., end user system, database server, public web server, etc.)

   o  Criticality - An enterprise-defined rating (possibly a score) that
      helps determine the criticality of the endpoint.  If this endpoint
      is attacked or lost, what is the impact to the overall enterprise?

   o  File system attributes - Attributes that describe the file or
      directory (e.g., versions, size, write date, modified date,
      checksum, etc.)

   o  Shared libraries - libraries that can be used by and installed
      with many different software applications.  A shared library
      vulnerability could affect multiple software applications in the
      same way.

   o  Other software configuration information - operating system or
      software application configuration attributes that go beyond that
      basic information already captured (e.g., Microsoft Windows
      registry, Apple configuration profiles, GConf, Proc filesystem,
      text configuration files and their parameters, and the
      installation paths.)

   External vulnerability description data

   o  Ingest Date - the date that the vulnerability description data was
      received by the enterprise.

   o  Date of Release - publication or disclosure date of the
      vulnerability description data

   o  Version - the version or iteration of the vulnerability
      description data according to the author, if applicable.

   o  External vuln ID - external or third-party IDs assigned to the
      vulnerability description data.  Could be multiple IDs in some
      cases (e.g., vendor bug id, global ID, discoverer's local ID,
      third-party vulnerability database ID, etc.).

   o  Severity Score - the severity of the vulnerability description
      data according to the vulnerability description data author, if
      applicable.

   Assessment Results

   o  Date of assessment - The date that the assessment was performed
      against an endpoint.

   o  Date of data collection - The age of the data used in the
      assessment to make the endpoint status determination.

   o  Endpoint identification and/or locally assigned ID - The ID
      assigned to the enterprise endpoint.  Must be assigned for
      tracking results over time.

   o  Vulnerable software product(s) - The vulnerable software products
      identified as being installed on the endpoint.

   o  Endpoint vulnerability status - Overall vulnerability status of
      the enterprise endpoint (i.e., Pass or Fail)

   o  Vulnerability description - A human-consumable description of a
      vulnerability.  Supports the human user understanding of the
      vulnerability assessment results within an application front-end
      or user interface.

   o  Vulnerability remediation - The fix, workaround, or patch
      information for a vulnerability.  This information may be a part
      of the vulnerability description described previously.  Note that
      this information can change over time due to vendor patch
      supercession.

Appendix E.  Alignment with Other Existing Works

E.1.  Critical Security Controls

   The Council on CyberSecurity's Critical Security Controls
   [critical-controls] includes security controls for a number of use
   scenarios, some of which are covered in this document.  This section
   documents the alignment between the Council's controls and the
   relevant elements of the scenario.

E.1.1.  Continuous Vulnerability Assessment

   "CSC 4: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation," which
   is described by the Council on CyberSecurity as "Continuously
   acquire, assess, and take action on new information in order to



Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


   identify vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of
   opportunity for attackers."  The scenario described in this document
   is aligned with CSC 4 in multiple ways:

   CSC 4-1 applies to this scenario in that it calls for running
   regular, automated scanning to deliver prioritized lists of
   vulnerabilities with which to respond.  The scenario described in
   this document is intended to be executed on a continuous basis, and
   the priorities of both vulnerability description data and the remedy
   of vulnerabilities are discussed in the Priority section earlier in
   this document.

   This scenario assumes that the enterprise already has a source for
   vulnerability description data as described in CSC 4-4.

   Both CSC 4-2 and 4-7 are made possible by writing information to a
   Repository since this makes previously collected data available for
   later analysis.

   While this scenario does not go into the details of how
   prioritization would be calculated or applied, it does touch on some
   of the important ways in which prioritization would impact the
   endpoint assessment process in the Priority section.  As such, the
   Priority section aligns with CSC 4-10, which deals with vulnerability
   priority.  Vulnerability priority in this scenario is discussed in
   terms of the vulnerability description data priority during receipt,
   as well as the vulnerability priority with regards to remedies.

   The described scenario does not address the details of applying a
   remedy based on assessment results.  As such, CSC 4-5, 4-8, and 4-9,
   which all deal with mitigations and patching, are out of scope for
   this work.  Similarly, CSC 4-3 prescribes performing scans in
   authenticated mode and CSC 4-6 prescribes monitoring logs.  This
   scenario does not get into the means by which data is collected,
   focusing on "what" to collect rather than "how", and as such does not
   have corresponding sections, although the procedures described are
   not incompatible with either of these controls.

   The CSC 4 System Entity Relationship diagram and numbered steps
   directly align with the scenario described in this document with the
   exception of step 7 (patch response).  Steps 1 -6 in CSC 4 describe
   the overall process for vulnerability management starting with
   obtaining the vulnerability description data from the source in Step
   1, to producing assessment results in step 6.

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


E.1.2.  Hardware and Software Inventories

   This scenario is also aligned with, and describes a process for,
   collecting and maintaining hardware and software inventories, which
   are covered by the Council on CyberSecurity CSC 1 "Inventory of
   Authorized and Unauthorized Devices" and CSC 2 "Inventory of
   Authorized and Unauthorized Software."  This scenario documents a
   process that is specific to collecting and maintaining hardware and
   software data attributes for vulnerability assessment purposes, but
   the collection of the hardware attributes and software inventory
   documented in the Endpoint Data Collection section that follows can
   also be used for the purpose of implementing authorized and
   unauthorized hardware and software management processes (e.g.,
   scanning tools looking for unauthorized software).  Moreover, the
   ability to accurately identify endpoints and, to a lesser degree,
   applications is integral to effective endpoint data collection and
   vulnerability management.

   The Endpoint Data Collection section does not have coverage for the
   specific details described in CSC 1 and 2 as they are different
   processes and would be out-of-scope of this scenario, but the section
   does provide the data necessary to support the controls.

   The Endpoint Identification and Endpoint Data Collection sections
   within this scenario align with CSC 1-1 and 1-4 by identifying
   enterprise endpoints and collecting their hardware and network
   attributes.  The Endpoint Data Collection section aligns with and
   supports CSC 2-3 and 2-4 by defining a software inventory process and
   a method of obtaining operating system and file system attributes.
   The rest of the items from CSC 1 and 2 deal with implementation
   details and would be out-of-scope for this document.

   CSC 2-9 describes the use of a software ID tag in XML format.  SWID
   tags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_19770) would also be a
   possible implementation for the Endpoint Data Collection section
   described in this scenario.

Appendix F.  SACM Usage Scenarios

   The SACM "Endpoint Security Posture Assessment: Enterprise Use Cases"
   document ([RFC7632]) defines multiple usage scenarios that are meant
   to provide examples of implementing the use cases and building block
   capabilities.  Below is a brief summary of some of these usage
   scenarios and how this document aligns and/or adds additional value
   to the identified usage scenarios.

   o  Automated Checklist Verification (2.2.2) - "An enterprise operates
      a heterogeneous IT environment.  They utilize vendor-provided



Coffin, et al.            Expires July 25, 2016                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


      automatable security configuration checklists for each operating
      system and application used within their IT environment.  Multiple
      checklists are used from different vendors to ensure adequate
      coverage of all IT assets."  The usage scenario, as defined in the
      RFC, is targeted at the checklist level and can be interpreted as
      being specific to endpoint configuration.  There is mention of
      patch assessment and vulnerability mitigation, but the usage
      scenario could be expanded upon by including vulnerability
      verification.  Replacing the idea of a checklist in the SACM usage
      scenario with vulnerability would allow the usage scenario to
      align almost exactly with the scenario described in this document.
      Instead of collecting automatable security configuration
      checklists, the enterprise would collect automatable vulnerability
      description data available from the vendor as described or
      possibly from other interested third-parties.

   o  Detection of Posture Deviations (2.2.3) - "An enterprise has
      established secure configuration baselines for each different type
      of endpoint within their IT environment.  When an endpoint
      connects to the network, the appropriate baseline configuration is
      communicated to the endpoint.  Once the baseline has been
      established, the endpoint is monitored for any change events
      pertaining to the baseline on an ongoing basis.  When a change
      occurs to posture defined in the baseline, updated posture
      information is exchanged.  When the endpoint detects a posture
      change, an alert is generated identifying the specific changes in
      posture."  This usage scenario would support the concept of
      endpoints signaling or alerting the enterprise to changes in the
      posture relates to endpoint vulnerabilities in the same way that
      it would for configurations.  Replacing the idea of a checklist
      with vulnerability description data allows the SACM usage scenario
      and the scenario described in this document to align in their
      objectives.

   o  Asynchronous Compliance/Vulnerability Assessment at Ice Station
      Zebra (2.2.5) - "An isolated arctic IT environment that is
      separated from the main university network.  The only network
      communications are via an intermittent, low-speed, high-latency,
      high-cost satellite link.  Remote network admins will need to show
      continued compliance with the security policies of the university,
      the government, and the provider of the satellite network, as well
      as keep current on vulnerability testing."  This SACM usage
      scenario describes vulnerability assessment and aligns well with
      the vulnerability scenario described in this document.  The
      endpoint assets are identified and associated data is published in
      a Repository.  Vulnerability description data is collected and
      saved in a Repository as it is released.  The vulnerability
      description data is queued for later assessment, then the

Internet-Draft             SACM Vuln Scenario               January 2016


      assessment results and vulnerability description data are stored
      after assessment.  The only real difference in this SACM usage
      scenario is the timing of the assessments.  The scenario described

      timing of this SACM usage scenario or anything similar.

Appendix G.  SACM Requirements and Charter - Future Work

   In the course authoring this document, some additional considerations
   for possible future work were noted.  The following points were taken
   from the SACM Requirements [I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements], SACM Charter
   [charter-ietf-sacm-01], and SACM Use Cases ([RFC7632]) documents and
   represent work that may be necessary to support the tasks or goals of
   SACM going forward.

   o  The SACM requirements mentions "Result Reporting" with
      applications but no detail around what the assessment results data
      set should include.  In the case of vulnerability assessment
      results, context is important and details beyond just a Pass or
      Fail result are needed in order to take action.  A good example of
      this might be the Priority of the vulnerability itself and how
      many systems it affects within the enterprise.  With this in mind,
      it might be worthwhile to investigate a minimum data set or schema
      for assessment results.  The concern here is with vulnerability
      description data, but this could apply to other enterprise
      processes as well.

   o  The "Human-assigned endpoint attributes" mentioned previously in
      this scenario are touched on in the SACM use cases, but the topic
      could probably be explored in much more depth.  Enterprise policy
      and behaviors could be greatly influenced by endpoint attributes
      such as locations, how the endpoint is used, and criticality.
      When and how these data attributes are collected, as well as what
      the minimum or common set might look like, would be good topics
      for future related SACM work.  In addition, the storage of these
      attributes could be central (stored in a data repository) or they
      could be assigned and stored on the endpoints themselves.
