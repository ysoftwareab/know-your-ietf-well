1. Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] includes an
   option that allows authentication of all DHCP messages, as specified
   in [2].  This document specifies a DHCP authentication mode based on
   Kerberos V tickets. This provides mutual authentication between a
   DHCP client and server, as well as authentication of all DHCP
   messages.

   This document specifies Kerberos message exchanges between an
   uninitialized client and the KDC (Key Distribution Center) using an
   IAKERB proxy [7] so that the Kerberos key management phase is
   decoupled from, and precedes the address allocation and network
   configuration phase that uses the DHCP authentication option.  In
   order to make use of the IAKERB proxy, this document specifies a

   transport mechanisms that work with an uninitialized client (i.e. a
   client without an assigned IP address).

3. Introduction

   3.1 Terminology

   o "DHCP client"

   A DHCP client is an Internet host using DHCP to obtain configuration
   parameters such as a network address.

   o "DHCP server"

   A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns configuration
   parameters to DHCP clients.

   O "Ticket"

   A Kerberos term for a record that helps a client authenticate itself
   to a server; it contains the client's identity, a session key, a
   timestamp, and other information, all sealed using the server's
   secret key. It only serves to authenticate a client when presented
   along with a fresh Authenticator.

   o "Key Distribution Center"

   Key Distribution Center, a network service that supplies tickets and
   temporary session keys; or an instance of that service or the host
   on which it runs. The KDC services both initial ticket and Ticket-
   Granting Ticket (TGT) requests. The initial ticket portion is
   sometimes referred to as the Authentication Server (or service). The
   Ticket-Granting Ticket portion is sometimes referred to as the
   Ticket-Granting Server (or service).

   o "Realm"

   A Kerberos administrative domain that represents a group of
   principals registered at a KDC.  A single KDC may be responsible for
   one or more realms.  A fully qualified principal name includes a
   realm name along with a principal name unique within that realm.

3.2 Protocol Overview

   DHCP as defined in [1] defines the protocol exchanges for a client
   to obtain its IP address and network configuration information from
   a DHCP Server. Kerberos V5 as described in [6] defines the protocol
   and message exchanges to mutually authenticate two parties. It is
   our goal to provide authentication support for DHCP using Kerberos.
   This implies that the Kerberos key management exchange has to take
   place before a client gets its IP address from the DHCP Server.
   Kerberos assumes that the client has a network address and can
   contact the Key Distribution Center to obtain its credentials for
   authenticated communication with an application server.

   In this specification we utilize the key exchange using an IAKERB
   proxy described in [7]. This does not require any changes to either
   the IAKERB or the Kerberos V5 specification.  This document also
   specifies a particular transport that allows an uninitialized client
   to contact an IAKERB proxy.

   The Kerberos ticket returned from the key management exchange
   discussed in section 0 of this document is passed to the DHCP Server
   inside the DHCP authentication option with the new Kerberos
   authenticator type. This is described in Section 6 of this draft.


3.3 Related Work

   A prior Internet Draft [3] outlined the use of Kerberos-based
   authentication for DHCP. The proposal tightly coupled the Kerberos
   client state machines and the DHCP client state machines. As a
   result, the Kerberos key management messages were carried in DHCP
   messages, along with the Kerberos authenticators.

   We propose a protocol exchange where Kerberos key management is
   decoupled from and precedes authenticated DHCP exchanges. This
   implies that the Kerberos ticket returned in the initial key
   management exchange could be used to authenticate servers assigning
   addresses by non-DHCP address assignment mechanisms like RSIP [4]
   and for service specific parameter provisioning mechanisms using SLP
   [5].

   In this architecture, the DHCP client obtains a Kerberos ticket from
   the Key Distribution Center (KDC) using standard Kerberos messages,
   as specified in [6].  The client, however, contacts the KDC via a
   proxy server, according to the IAKERB mechanism, described in [7].
   The are several reasons why a client has to go through this proxy in
   order to contact the KDC:

  a)The client may not know the host address of the KDC and may be
     sending its first request message as a broadcast on a local
     network.  The KDC may not be located on the local network, and
     even if it were - it will be unable to communicate with a client
     without an IP address.  This document describes a specific
     mechanism that may be used by a client to communicate with the
     Kerberos proxy.

             Kerberos V Authentication Mode for DHCP        March 2000


  b)The client may not know its Kerberos realm name.  The proxy is
     able to fill in the missing client realm name in an AS Request
     message, as specified in IAKERB.  Note that in the case that
     PKINIT pre-authenticator is used [8], the realm name in the AS
     Request may be the KDC realm name and not the client's realm name.

 c) The client may not know the realm name of the DHCP server.
According to IAKERB, when the client sends a TGS Request with a missing
server realm name, the proxy will return to the client an error message
containing the missing realm name.

     Note that in this case the proxy could return the client a wrong
     realm name and the client could be fooled into obtaining a ticket
     for the wrong DHCP server (on the same local network).  However,
     the wrong DHCP server must still be a registered principal in a
     KDC database.  In some circumstances this may be an acceptable
     compromise.  Also, see the security considerations section.

   IAKERB describes the proxy as part of an application server - the
   DHCP server in this case.  However, in this document we are not
   requiring the proxy to be integrated with the DHCP server.  The same
   IAKERB mechanisms apply in the more general case, where the proxy is
   an independent application.  This proxy, however, MUST be reachable
   by a client via a local network broadcast.

   After a client has obtained a Kerberos ticket for the DHCP server,
   it will use it as part of an authenticaton option in the DHCP
   messages.  The only extension to the DHCP protocol is the addition
   of a new authenticator type based on Kerberos tickets.

4.1 Cross-Realm Authentication

   The above diagram shows a client communicating with a single KDC via
   a proxy.  However, the DHCP client's realm may be different from the
   DHCP server's realm.  In that case, the client may need to first
   contact the KDC in its local realm to obtain a cross-realm TGT.
   Then, the client would use the cross-realm TGT to contact the KDC in
   the DHCP server's realm, as specified in [6].

   In the following example a client doesn't know its realm or the DHCP
   server's realm, which happens to be different from the client's
   realm.  Here are the steps in obtaining the ticket for the DHCP
   server (based on [6] and [7]):

        1) The client sends AS Request with NULL realm to the proxy.
        2) The proxy fills in the realm and forwards the AS Request to
           the KDC in the client's realm.
        3) The KDC issues a TGT and sends back an AS Reply to the
           proxy.
        4) The proxy forwards AS Reply to the client.
        5) The client sends TGS Request for a principal name "dhcpsrvr"
           with NULL realm to the proxy.

             Kerberos V Authentication Mode for DHCP        March 2000


        6) The proxy returns KRB_AP_ERR_REALM_REQUIRED error with the
           DHCP server's realm to the client.
        7) The client sends another TGS Request for a cross-realm TGT
           to the proxy.
        8) The proxy forwards the TGS Request to the KDC in the
           client's realm.
        9) The KDC issues a cross-realm TGT and sends back a TGS Reply
           to the proxy.
       10) The proxy forwards TGS Reply to the client.
       11) The client sends a TGS Request to the proxy for a principal
'dhcpsrvr' with the realm name filled in, using a cross-realm TGT.
       12) The proxy forwards TGS Request to the KDC in the DHCP
server's realm.
       13) The KDC issues a ticket for the DHCP server and sends TGS
Reply back to the proxy.
       14) The proxy forwards TGS Reply to the client.

   In a most general case, the client may need to contact any number of
   KDCs in different realms before it can get a ticket for the DHCP
   server.  In each case, the client would contact a KDC via the proxy
   server, as specified in Section 5 of this document.

4.2 Public Key Authentication

   This specification also allows clients to perform public key
   authentication to the KDC, based on the PKINIT specification [8].
   In this case, the size of an AS Request and AS Reply messages is
   likely to exceed the size of typical link MTU's.

   Here is an example, where PKINIT is used by a DHCP client that is
   not a registered principal in the KDC principal database:

        1) The client sends AS Request with a PKINIT Request pre-
           authenticator to the proxy.  This includes the client's
           signature and X.509 certificate.  The KDC realm field is
           left as NULL.
        2) The proxy fills in the realm and forwards the AS Request to
           the KDC in the filled in realm.  This is the realm of the
           DHCP server.  Here, the client's realm is the name of a
           Certification Authority - not the same as the KDC realm.
        3) The KDC issues a TGT and sends back an AS Reply with a
           PKINIT Reply pre-authenticator to the proxy.
        4) The proxy forwards the AS Reply to the client.
        5) The client sends TGS Request for a principal name "dhcpsrvr"
           with the realm found in the TGT to the proxy.
        6) The proxy forwards TGS Request to the KDC in the DHCP
           server's realm.
        7) The KDC issues a ticket for the DHCP server and sends TGS
           Reply back to the proxy.
        8) The proxy forwards TGS Reply to the client.

5. Key Management Exchange That Precedes Network Address Allocation

   An uninitialized host (e.g. on power-on and reset) does not have a
   network address. It does have a link layer address or hardware
   address. At this time, the client may not have any information on
   its realm or the realm of the address allocation server (DHCP
   Server).

   In the Kerberos key management exchange, a client gets its ticket
   granting ticket (TGT) by contacting the Authentication Server in the
   KDC using the AS_Request / Reply messages (shown as messages 1 and 2
   in Figure 1). The client then contacts the Ticket Granting Server in
   the KDC to get the DHCP server ticket (to be used for mutual
   authentication with the DHCP server) using the TGS_REQ / TGS_REP
   messages (shown as messages 3 and 4 in the above figure).  It is
   also possible for the client to obtain a DHCP server ticket directly
   with the AS Request / Reply exchange, without the use of the TGT.

   In the use of Kerberos for DHCP authentication, the client (a) does
   not have an IP/network address (b) does not know he KDC's IP address
   (c) the KDC may not be on the local network and (d) the client may
   not know the DHCP Server's IP address and realm.  We therefore
   require a Kerberos proxy on the local network to accept broadcast
   Kerberos request messages (AS_REQ and TGS_REQ) from uninitialized
   clients and relay them to the appropriate KDC.

   The uninitialized client formulates a broadcast AS_REQ or TGS_REQ as
   follows:

   The request payload contains the client hardware address in
   addresses field with a negative value for the address type. Kerberos
   v5 [6] allows for the usage of negative address types for "local"
   use. Note that IAKERB [7] discourages the use of the addresses field
   as network addresses may not be known or may change in situation
   where proxies are used. In this draft we incorporate the negative
   values permitted in the Kerberos transport in the address type field
   of both the AS_REQ and TGS_REQ messages. The negative value MUST be
   the negative number of the hardware address type "htype" value (from
   assigned numbers RFC) used in RFC 2131. The address field of the
   message contains the clients hardware address.

   The request payload is UDP encapsulated and addressed to port 88 on
   the server/proxy. The UDP source port is selected by the client. The
   source and destination network addresses are the all-zero's address
   and the broadcast address, respectively. For IPv4, the source IP
   address is set to 0.0.0.0 and the destination IP address is set to
   255.255.255.255. The data link layer header source address
   corresponds to the link layer/hardware address of the client. The
   destination link layer address is the broadcast address at the link
   layer (e.g. for Ethernet the address is ffffffff).

             Kerberos V Authentication Mode for DHCP        March 2000


   In the case where AS_REQ message contains a PKINIT pre-authenticator
   for public key-based client authentication (based on [8]), the
   message will probably not fit into a single UDP packet given typical
   link MTU's.

   It is assumed that the proxy server on a network is configured with
   a list of KDC's, their realms and their IP addresses. The proxy
   server will act as a client to the KDC and forward standard Kerberos
   messages to/from the KDC using unicast UDP or TCP transport
   mechanisms, according to [6].

   Upon receiving a broadcast request from a client, the proxy MUST
   record the client's hardware address that appears as the source
   address on the frame as well as in the addresses field of the
   request message. Based on the realm of the KDC specified in the
   request, the proxy determines the KDC to which this message is
   relayed as a unicast message from the proxy to the KDC.  In the case
   that the client left the KDC realm name as NULL, it is up to the
   proxy to first determine the correct realm name and fill it in the
   request (according to [7]).

   On receiving an request, the KDC formulates a response (AS_REP or
   TGS_REP). It includes the client's addresses field in the encrypted
   part of the ticket (according to [6]). This response is unicast to
   the proxy.

   Upon receiving the reply, the proxy MUST first determine the
   previously saved hardware address of the client.  The proxy
   broadcasts the reply on its local network. This is a network layer
   broadcast. At the link level, it uses the hardware address obtained
   from the addresses field of the request.

   The client on receiving the response (link layer destination address
   as its hardware address, network layer address is the broadcast
   address) must verify that the hardware address in the ticket
   corresponds to its link layer address.

   Upon receiving a TGS_REP (or an AS_REP with the application server
   ticket) from the proxy, the client will have enough information to
   securely communicate with the application server (the DHCP Server in
   this case), as specified in the following section.


 6. Authenticated Message Exchange Between the DHCP Client and the DHCP
Server

   The ticket returned in the TGS response is used by the DHCP client
   for two purposes: to  establish a shared session key with the DHCP
   server, and is also included as part of a Kerberos authenticator in
   the DHCP request.

             Kerberos V Authentication Mode for DHCP        March 2000


   If the size of the authenticator is greater than 255 bytes, the DHCP
   authentication option is repeated multiple times.  When the values
   of all the authentication options are concatenated together, they
   will make up the complete authenticator.  This method of handling
   long authenticators is currently not specified in the DHCP
   authentication draft [2] but is expected be added in the next
   version of the draft.

   Once the session key is established, the following messages sent by
   both the DHCP client and the DHCP server will use an authenticator
   defined as protocol 1 in [2].

   The Kerberos authenticator for a DHCP request message is specified
   below:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +              Replay Detection (64 bits)                       +
   |                                                               |

   The format of this authenticator is in accordance with [2]. The code
   for the authentication option is TBD, and the length field contains
   the length of the remainder of the option, starting with the
   protocol field.

   The value of the protocol field for this authenticator is 2.

   The algorithm field can take the following values:
        1 - HMAC-MD5
        2 - HMAC-SHA-1

   Replay protection field is a monotonically increasing counter field.
   Inside the Kerberos authenticator, it may be set to any value.  This
   field must be monotonically increasing in the following messages
   sent by the client (inside an authenticator using protocol 1).

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The following attributes must be included in the authenticator
   token:

   Type         Attribute Name          Value
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   0            Message Integrity Code  Depends on the value of the
                                        algorithm field.  Its length is
                                        16 bytes for HMAC-MD5 [9, 10]
                                        and 20 bytes for HMAC-SHA-1
                                        [11, 10].  The Kerberos session
                                        key found in the Kerberos
                                        ticket
                                        is used directly as an HMAC key
                                        (see security considerations).

   1            AP_REQ                  ASN.1 encoding of a Kerberos
                                        AP_REQ message, as specified in
                                        [6].

   AP_REQ contains the Kerberos ticket for the DHCP server and also
   contains information needed by the DHCP server to authenticate the
   client.  After verifying the AP_REQ and decrypting the Kerberos
   ticket, the DHCP server is able to extract a session key which it
   now shares with the DHCP client.

   The Kerberos authenticator token contains its own replay protection
   mechanism inside the AP_REQ structure.  The AP_REQ contains a
   timestamp that must be within an agreed upon time window at the DHCP
   server.  However, this does not require the DHCP clients to maintain
   an accurate clock between reboots.  Kerberos allows clients to
   synchronize their clock with the KDC with the help of Kerberos
   KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW error message, as specified in [6].

   The DHCP server must save both the session key and its associated
   expiration time found in the Kerberos ticket.  Up until the
   expiration time, the server must accept client requests with the
   authenticator using protocol 1, with the Kerberos session key as the
   MD5 HMAC key.

   All DHCP server responses must also contain an authenticator using
   protocol 1, with the same Kerberos session key as the MD5 HMAC key.

   When the session key expires, it is up to the client to obtain a new
   ticket from the KDC and to attach a Kerberos authenticator to the
   next DHCP request message (instead of the authenticator using
   protocol 1).


7. Detailed message flows for Kerberos and DHCP message Exchanges

   The following flow depicts the kerberos exchange in witch a AS REQ
   message is used to directly request the DHCP Server ticket. There
   are no changes to transport mechanisms below when the additional
   phase of using TGS requests/responses with TGT's is used.

      src link layer address = Proxy's HW/link address
     destination link layer address =
        Client's link layer address from AS_REQ



 The client uses the ticket received from the KDC in the DHCP
Authentication option as described in Section 6.

8. Security Considerations

   DHCP clients that do not know the DHCP server's realm name will get
   it from the proxy, as specified in IAKERB [7].  Since the proxy is
   not authenticated, a DHCP client can be fooled into obtaining a
   ticket for the wrong DHCP server in the wrong realm.

   This could happen when the client leaves out the server realm name
   in a TGS Request message to the proxy.  It is also possible,
   however, for a client to directly request a DHCP server ticket with
   an AS Request message.  In those cases, the same situation occurs
   when the client leaves out the realm name in an AS Request.

   This wrong DHCP server is still registered as a valid principal in a
   database of a KDC that can be trusted by the client.  In some
   circumstances a client may assume that a DHCP server that is a
   Kerberos principal registered with a trusted KDC will not attempt to
   deliberately misconfigure a client.

   This specification provides a tradeoff between:

        1) The DHCP clients knowing DHCP server's realm ahead of time,
           which provides for full 2-way authentication at the cost of
           an additional configuration parameter.
        2) The DHCP clients not requiring any additional configuration
           information, besides a password or a key (and a public key
           certificate if PKINIT is used).  This is at the cost of not
           being able to fully authenticate the identity of the DHCP
           server.

   In this specification the Kerberos session key is used directly as
   an HMAC key to authenticate DHCP message.  Standard security
   practice, however, is to use different keys for different purposes.
   The Kerberos session key is already used to encrypt a part of an
   AP_REQ message.

   There is a near term plan to update the Kerberos V specification
   with the procedure for deriving a separate authentication key from
   the Kerberos session key.  After the Kerberos V specification is
   updated, this draft should also be updated, to use the same key
   derivation procedure for the DHCP message authentication key.
