Abstract 
    
   There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a 
   Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and 
   automatically discover a set of Path Computation Element(s) (PCE), 
   along with some of information that can be used for PCE selection. 
   When the PCE is a Label Switch Router (LSR) participating to the IGP, 
   or even a server participating passively to the IGP, a simple and

   efficient way for PCE discovery consists of relying on IGP flooding. 
   For that purpose this document defines IS-IS extensions for the 
   advertisement of PCE Discovery information within an IS-IS area or 
   within the entire IS-IS routing domain.

3. Introduction 
 
   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE)-based path computation model for Multi 
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic 
   Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE-LSPs). The model allows for the 
   separation of PCE from PCC (also referred to as non co-located PCE) 
   and allows for cooperation between PCEs. This relies on a 
   communication protocol between PCC and PCE, and between PCEs. The 
   requirements for such communication protocol can be found in [RFC4657] 
   and the communication protocol is defined in [PCEP]. 
          
   The PCE architecture requires, of course, that a PCC be aware of the 
   location of one or more PCEs in its domain, and also potentially of 
   some PCEs in other domains, e.g. in case of inter-domain TE LSP 
   computation.  
    
   A network may comprise a large number of PCEs with potentially 
   distinct capabilities. In such context it is highly desirable to have 
   a mechanism for automatic and dynamic PCE discovery, which allows 
   PCCs to automatically discover a set of PCEs, along with additional 
   information required for PCE selection, and to dynamically detect new 
   PCEs or any modification of PCE information. Detailed requirements 
   for such a PCE discovery mechanism are described in [RFC4674]. 
    
   Moreover, it may also be useful to discover when a PCE experiences 
   some processing congestion state and exits such state, in order for 
   the PCCs to take some appropriate actions (e.g. redirect to another 
   PCE). Note that the PCE selection algorithm is out of the scope of 
   this document. 
    
   When PCCs are LSRs participating to the IGP (OSPF, IS-IS), and PCEs 
   are LSRs or a servers also participating to the IGP, an efficient 
   mechanism for PCE discovery within an IGP routing domain consists of 
   relying on IGP advertisements. 
    
   This document defines IS-IS extensions allowing a PCE participating 
   to the IS-IS routing to advertise its location along with some 
   information useful for PCE selection, so as to satisfy dynamic PCE 
   discovery requirements set forth in [RFC4674]. This document also 
   defines extensions allowing a PCE participating to the IS-IS routing 
   to advertise its potential processing congestion state. 
    
   Generic capability mechanisms for IS-IS have been defined in [IS-IS-
   CAP] the purpose of which is to allow a router to advertise its 
   capability within an IS-IS area or an entire IS-IS routing domain. 
   Such IS-IS extensions fully satisfy the aforementioned dynamic PCE 
   discovery requirements.  
    
   This document defines two new sub-TLVs (named the PCE Discovery 
   (PCED) TLV and the PCE Status (PCES) TLV) for IS-IS, to be carried 
   within the IS-IS Capability TLV ([IS-IS-CAP]). The PCE information

   advertised is detailed in section 4. Protocol extensions and 
   procedures are defined in section 5 and 6.  
 
   This document does not define any new IS-IS element of procedure but 
   how the procedures defined in [IS-IS-CAP] should be used. 
    
   The routing extensions defined in this document allow for PCE 
   discovery within an IS-IS Routing domain. Solutions for PCE discovery 
   across AS boundaries are beyond the scope of this document, and for 
   further study. 
    
   This document defines a set of sub-TLVs that are nested within each 
   other. When the degree of nesting TLVs is 2 (a TLV is carried within 
   another TLV) the TLV carried within a TLV is called a sub-TLV. 
   Strictly speaking, when the degree of nesting is 3, a subsub-TLV is 
   carried within a sub-TLV that is itself carried within a TLV. For the 
   sake of terminology simplicity, we refer to sub-TLV, a TLV carried 
   within a TLV regardless of the degree of nesting. 
    
4. Overview 
 
4.1. PCE Information  
 
   The PCE information advertised via IS-IS falls into two categories:  
   PCE Discovery Information and PCE Status information.  
 
4.1.1. PCE Discovery Information 
 
   The PCE Discovery information is comprised of: 
 
   - The PCE location: an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that must be  
     used to reach the PCE. It is RECOMMENDED to use addresses always     
     reachable; 
    
   - The PCE inter-domain functions: PCE path computation scope (i.e.  
     inter-area, inter-AS, inter-layer…); 
    
   - The PCE domain(s): set of one or more domain(s) where the PCE has  
     visibility and can compute paths; 
 
   - The PCE Destination domain(s): set of one or more destination 
      domain(s) towards which a PCE can compute paths; 
 
   - A set of general PCEP capabilities (e.g. support for request    
     prioritization) and path computation specific capabilities    
     (e.g. supported constraints, supported objective functions).  
      
   Optional elements to describe more complex capabilities may also be 
   advertised. 
    
   PCE Discovery information is by nature fairly static and does not 
   change with PCE activity. Changes in PCE Discovery information may 
 
Le Roux, Vasseur et al. IS-IS extensions for PCE discovery    [Page 5] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-ietf-pce-disco-proto-IS-IS-01.txt  December 2006 


   occur as a result of PCE configuration updates, PCE 
   deployment/activation, PCE deactivation/suppression or PCE failure. 
   Hence, this information is not expected to change frequently. 
 
4.1.2. PCE Status Information  
 
   The PCE Status is optional and can be used to report a PCE processing 
   congested state along with an estimated congestion duration. This is 
   dynamic information, which may change with PCE activity.  
        
   Procedures for a PCE to move from a processing congested state to a 
   non-congested state are beyond the scope of this document, but the 
   rate at which a PCE Status change is advertised MUST not impact by 
   any mean the IGP scalability. Particular attention should be given on 
   procedures to avoid state oscillations.  
    
4.2. Flooding scope 
 
   The flooding scope for PCE Discovery Information can be limited to 
   one or more IS-IS areas the PCE belongs to or can be extended across 
   the entire IS-IS routing domain.  
   Note that some PCEs may belong to multiple areas, in which case the 
   flooding scope may comprise these areas. This could be the case of a 
   L1L2 router for instance advertising its PCE information within the 
   L2 level and/or a subset of its attached L1 area(s). 
 
5. IS-IS extensions 
 
5.1. IS-IS PCED TLV format 
    
   The IS-IS PCED TLV is made of various non ordered sub-TLVs.  
    
   The format of the IS-IS PCED TLV and its sub-TLVs is the same as the 
   TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS-IS 
   [RFC3784]. That is, the TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type, 1 
   octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.   
 
   The IS-IS PCED TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA   
      LENGTH: Variable 
      VALUE: set of sub-TLVs 
 
   Sub-TLVs types are under IANA control. 
    
   Currently five sub-TLVs are defined (suggested type values to be 
   assigned by IANA):                   
            Sub-TLV type  Length               Name   
                1      variable     PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV   
                2         3         PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV 
                3      variable     PCE-DOMAINS sub-TLV 
                4      variable     PCE-DEST-DOMAINS sub-TLV  
 
Le Roux, Vasseur et al. IS-IS extensions for PCE discovery    [Page 6] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-ietf-pce-disco-proto-IS-IS-01.txt  December 2006 


                5      variable     GENERAL-CAP sub-TLV 
                6      variable     PATH-COMP-CAP sub-TLV 
    
    
   The PCE-ADDRESS and PATH-SCOPE sub-TLVs MUST always be present within 
   the PCED TLV.  
 
   The PCE-DOMAINS and PCE-DEST-DOMAINS sub-TLVs are optional. They may  
   be present in the PCED TLV to facilitate selection of inter-domain  
   PCEs. 
  
   The GENERAL-CAP and PATH-COMP-CAP sub-TLVs are optional and MAY be 
   present in the PCED TLV to facilitate the PCE selection process. 
    
   Any non recognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored.   
    
   Additional sub-TLVs could be added in the future to advertise 
   additional PCE information. 
    
   The PCED TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV defined in 
   [IS-IS-CAP], whose S bit is determined by the desired flooding scope. 
    
 
5.1.1. PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV  
    
   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV specifies the IP address that MUST be  
   used to reach the PCE. It is RECOMMENDED to make use of an address     
   that is always reachable, provided the PCE is alive. 
 
   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the  
   PCED TLV. It MAY appear twice, when the PCE has both an IPv4 and  
   IPv6 address. It MUST NOT appear more than once for the same address  
   type. 
 
   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =1)   
      LENGTH: 5 for IPv4 address and 17 for IPv6 address 
      VALUE: This comprises one octet indicating the address-type and 4  
             or 16 octets encoding the IPv4 or IPv6 address to be used  
             to reach the PCE 
 
   Address-type:  
                  1   IPv4  
                  2   IPv6

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-pce-disco-proto-IS-IS-01.txt  December 2006 


5.1.2. The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV 
 
   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV indicates the PCE path computation scope which 
   refers to the PCE ability to compute or take part into the 
   computation of intra-area, inter-area, inter-AS or inter-layer_TE 
   LSP(s).  
    
   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the 
   PCED TLV. There MUST be exactly one instance of the PATH-SCOPE sub-
   TLV within each PCED TLV. 
    
   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV contains a set of bit flags indicating the 
   supported path scopes (intra-area, inter-area, inter-AS, inter-layer) 
   and four fields indicating PCE preferences.  
 
   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV has the following format:  
    
   TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =2)   
   LENGTH: 3 
   VALUE: This comprises a one-byte flag of bits where each bit  
          represents a supported path scope, followed by a 2-bytes  
          preferences field indicating PCE preferences.  
           
   Here is the structure of the bits flag: 
    
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
      |0|1|2|3|4|5|Res|              
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 
 
   Bit      Path Scope 
 
   0      L bit: Can compute intra-area path 
   1      R bit: Can act as PCE for inter-area TE LSPs computation 
   2      Rd bit: Can act as a default PCE for inter-area TE LSPs  
                  computation        
   3      S bit: Can act as PCE for inter-AS TE LSPs computation 
   4      Sd bit: Can act as a default PCE for inter-AS TE LSPs   
                  computation       
   5      Y bit: Can compute or take part into the computation of  
                 paths across layers 
   6-7   Reserved for future usage. 
    
    
   Here is the structure of the preferences field 
    
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |PrefL|PrefR|PrefS|PrefY| Res   |              
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Pref-L field: PCE's preference for intra-area TE LSPs computation. 
    
Pref-R field: PCE’s preference for inter-area TE LSPs computation. 
    
Pref-S field: PCE’s preference for inter-AS TE LSPs computation. 
    
Pref-Y field: PCE's preference for inter-layer TE LSPs computation. 
    
Res: Reserved for future usage. 
 
   The bits L, R, S and Y bits are set when the PCE can act as a PCE for 
   intra-area, inter-area, inter-AS and inter-layer TE LSPs computation 
   respectively. These bits are non mutually exclusive. 
    
   When set the Rd bit indicates that the PCE can act as a default PCE 
   for inter-area TE LSPs computation (the PCE can compute path for any 
   destination area). Similarly, when set the Sd bit indicates that the 
   PCE can act as a default PCE for inter-AS TE LSPs computation (the 
   PCE can compute path for any destination AS).  
    
   When the Rd bit is set, the PCE-DEST-DOMAIN TLV (see 5.1.4) does not 
   contain any Area ID DOMAIN sub-TLV.  
    
   Similarly, when the Sd bit is set, the PCE-DEST-DOMAIN TLV does not 
   contain any AS-DOMAIN sub-TLV. 
    
   The PrefL, PrefR, PrefS and PrefY fields are 3-bit long and allow the 
   PCE to specify a preference for each computation scope, where 7 
   reflects the highest preference. Such preference can be used for 
   weighted load balancing of requests. An operator may decide to 
   configure a preference to each PCE so as to balance the path 
   computation load among them, with respect to their respective CPU 
   capacity. The algorithms used by a PCC to balance its path 
   computation requests according to such PCE’s preference are out of 
   the scope of this document. Same or distinct preferences may be used 
   for different scopes. For instance an operator that wants a PCE 
   capable of both inter-area and inter-AS computation to be used 
   preferably for inter-AS computation may configure a PrefS higher than 
   the PrefR. When the PrefL, PrefR, PRefS or PrefY is cleared, this 
   indicates an absence of preference. 
    
   When the L bit, R bit, S or Y bit are cleared the PrefL, PrefR, 
   PrefS, PrefY fields MUST respectively be set to 0.

5.1.3. PCE-DOMAINS sub-TLV  
    
   The PCE-DOMAINS sub-TLV specifies the set of domains (areas or AS) 
   where the PCE has topology visibility and can compute paths. It 
   contains a set of one or more sub-TLVs where each sub-TLV identifies 
   a domain. 
 
   The PCE-DOMAINS sub-TLV MUST be present when PCE domains cannot be 
   inferred by other IGP information, for instance when the PCE is 
   inter-domain capable (i.e. when the R bit or S bit is set) and the 
   flooding scope is the entire routing domain. 
 
   The PCE-DOMAINS sub-TLV has the following format: 
    
   TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =2)   
   LENGTH: Variable 
   VALUE: This comprises a set of one or more DOMAIN sub-TLVs where  
          each DOMAIN sub-TLV identifies a domain where the PCE has  
          topology visibility and can compute paths 
    
   DOMAIN sub-TLVs types are under IANA control. 
    
   Currently two DOMAIN sub-TLVs are defined (suggested type values to 
   be assigned by IANA):                   
            Sub-TLV type  Length        Name   
                1      variable     Area ID sub-TLV   
                2           4       AS number sub-TLV 
         
   At least one DOMAIN sub-TLV MUST be present in the PCE-DOMAINS sub-
   TLV. Note than when the PCE visibility is an entire AS, the PCE-
   DOMAINS sub-TLV MUST uniquely include one AS number sub-TLV. 
    
            
5.1.3.1. Area ID DOMAIN sub-TLV 
    
   This sub-TLV carries an IS-IS area ID. It has the following format 
    
   TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =1)   
   LENGTH: Variable 
   VALUE: This comprises a variable length IS-IS area ID. This is the    
          combination of an Initial Domain Part (IDP) and High Order  
          part of the Domain Specific part (HO-DSP)  
 
5.1.3.2. AS Number DOMAIN sub-TLV 
    
   The AS Number sub-TLV carries an AS number. It has the following 
   format: 
    
   TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =2)   
   LENGTH: 4 
   VALUE: AS number identifying an AS. When coded on two  
          bytes (which is the current defined format as the

          MUST have its left two bytes set to 0. 
 
 
5.1.4. PCE-DEST-DOMAINS sub-TLV  
    
   The PCE-DEST-DOMAINS sub-TLV specifies the set of destination domains 
   (areas, AS) toward which a PCE can compute paths. It means that the 
   PCE can compute or take part in the computation of inter-domain TE 
   LSPs whose destinations are located within one of these domains. It 
   contains a set of one or more DOMAIN sub-TLVs where each DOMAIN sub-
   TLV identifies a domain. 
 
   The PCE-DEST-DOMAINS sub-TLV has the following format: 
    
   TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =3)   
   LENGTH: Variable 
   VALUE: This comprises a set of one or more area or/and AS DOMAIN sub- 
          TLVs where each sub-TLV identifies a destination domain toward  
          which a PCE can compute path.  
    
   The PCE-DEST-DOMAINS sub-TLV MUST be present if the R bit is set and 
   the Rd bit is cleared, and/or, if the S bit is set and the Sd bit is 
   cleared. 
 
   The PCE-DEST-DOMAINS sub-TLV MUST include at least one DOMAIN sub-
   TLV. It MUST include at least one area ID sub-TLV, if the R bit of 
   the PATH-SCOPE TLV is set and the Rd bit of the PATH-SCOPE TLV is 
   cleared. Similarly, it MUST include at least one AS number sub-TLV if 
   the S bit of the PATH-SCOPE TLV is set and the Sd bit of the PATH-
   SCOPE TLV is cleared. 
 
5.1.5. GENERAL-CAP sub-TLV  
           
   The GENERAL-CAP sub-TLV is an optional TLV used to indicate PCEP 
   related capabilities. It carries a 32-bit flag, where each bit 
   corresponds to a general PCE capability. It MAY also include optional 
   sub-TLVs to encode more complex capabilities. 
       
   The GENERAL-CAP sub-TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =4)   
      LENGTH: Variable 
      VALUE: This comprises a 32-bit General Capabilities flag where  
             each bit corresponds to a general PCE capability, and  
             optional sub-TLVs that may be defined to specify more  
             complex capabilities. Currently no sub-TLVs are defined.

5.1.6. The PATH-COMP-CAP sub-TLV  
           
   The PATH-COMP-CAP sub-TLV is an optional TLV used to indicate path 
   computation specific capabilities of a PCE.  
   It comprises a 32-bit flag, where each bit corresponds to a path 
   computation capability. It MAY also include optional sub-TLVs to 
   encode more complex capabilities.    
 
   The PATH-COMP-CAP sub-TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (suggested value = 5)  
      LENGTH: Variable 
      VALUE: This comprises one 32 bit Path Computation Capabilities  
             Flag, where each bit corresponds to a path computation  
             capability, and optional sub-TLVs that may be defined to  
             specify more complex capabilities. Three optional sub-TLVs

The G, B, D, L, S, O and P bits are not exclusive. 
 
   Three optional sub-TLVs are currently defined for the PATH-COMP-CAP  
   TLV: 
   - The Objective Functions sub-TLV (type to be defined, suggested 
      value =1) that carries a list of supported objective functions, 
      where each objective function is identified by a 16 bit integer. 
   - The Opaque Objective Function sub-TLV (type to be defined,  
      suggested value =2) that allows the user to encode a specific  
      objective function in any appropriate language. 
   - The Switch Caps sub-TLV (type to be defined, suggested value =3) 
      that carries a list of supported switching capabilities. This 
      means that the PCE can compute paths for the listed switching 
      capabilities.

5.2. The IS-IS PCES sub-TLV  
    
   The IS-IS PCE Status TLV (PCES sub-TLV) carries information related 
   to PCE processing congestion state. The PCES sub-TLV is carried 
   within an IS-IS Capability TLV which is defined in [IS-IS-CAP]. 
     
   The IS-IS PCES sub-TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA   
      LENGTH: Variable 
      VALUE: set of sub-TLVs 
 
   Sub-TLVs types are under IANA control. 
    
   Currently two sub-TLVs are defined (suggested type values to be 
   assigned by IANA):                   
           Sub-TLV type  Length               Name   
                1      variable     PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV   
                2         3         CONGESTION sub-TLV 
             
   There MUST be exactly one occurrence of the PCE-ADDRESS and  
   CONGESTION sub-TLVs within a PCES sub-TLV. The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV is  
   defined in section 5.1.1. It carries one of the PCE IP addresses and  
   is used to identify the PCE experiencing a processing congestion  
   state. This is required as the PCES and PCED TLVs may be carried in  
   separate IS-IS Capability TLVs. 
   A PCE implementation MUST use the same IP address for the PCE- 
   ADDRESS sub-TLV carried within the PCED sub-TLV and the PCE-ADDRESS  
   sub-TLV carried within the PCES sub-TLV.  
 
   Any non recognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored.   
    
   Additional sub-TLVs could be added in the future to advertise 
   additional congestion information. 
 
5.2.1. The CONGESTION sub-TLV 
           
   The CONGESTION sub-TLV is used to indicate whether a PCE experiences 
   a processing congestion state or not along with optionally the PCE 
   expected congestion duration. 
   The CONGESTION sub-TLV is mandatory. There MUST be a single instance 
   of the CONGESTION sub-TLV within the PCES TLV.  
    
   The format of the CONGESTION sub-TLV is as follows: 
 
   TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =2)   
   LENGTH: 3 
   VALUE: This comprises a one-byte flag of bits indicating the  
          congestion status, followed by a 2-bytes field indicating the  
          congestion duration.

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |C|       Reserved|      Congestion Duration      |                               
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                   
         Value  
           -C bit: When set this indicates that the PCE experiences  
                   congestion and cannot accept any new request. When  
                   cleared this indicates that the PCE does not  
                   experience congestion and can accept new requests. 
    
           -Congestion Duration: 2-bytes, the estimated PCE congestion  
                                 duration in seconds.  
    
   When C is set and the Congestion Duration field is equal to 0, this 
   means that the Congestion Duration is unknown. 
   When C is cleared the Congestion Duration MUST be set to 0. 
 
 
 
6. Elements of Procedure 
     
   The PCED and PCES TLV are carried within an IS-IS Capability TLV 
   defined in [IS-IS-CAP].  
    
   As PCES information is likely to change more frequently than the PCED 
   information, it is RECOMMENDED to carry PCES and PCED TLVs in 
   separate IS-IS Capability TLVs, so as not to carry all PCED 
   information each time the PCE status changes. 
    
   An IS-IS router MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content  
   of any of the PCED TLV or PCES TLV changes or whenever required by 
   the regular IS-IS procedure (LSP refresh).  
    
   When the scope of the PCED or PCES TLV is area local it MUST be 
   carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV having the S bit cleared. 
   When the scope of the PCED or PCES TLV is the entire IGP domain, the 
   PCED TLV MUST be carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV having the S 
   bit set.  
   When only the L bit of the PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV is set, the flooding  
   scope MUST be local. 
   Note that the flooding scopes of the PCED and PCES TLVs may be 
   distinct, in which case they are carried in distinct IS-IS Capability 
   TLVs. 
 
   The PCED and PCES sub-TLVs are OPTIONAL. When an IS-IS LSP does not  
   contain any PCED or PCES sub-TLV, this means that the PCE information  
   of that node is unknown.   
 
 
 
Le Roux, Vasseur et al. IS-IS extensions for PCE discovery   [Page 16] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-ietf-pce-disco-proto-IS-IS-01.txt  December 2006 


   A change in PCED or PCES information MUST not trigger any  
   SPF computation. 
    
   The way PCEs retrieve their own information is out of the scope of 
   this document. Some information may be configured (e.g. address, 
   preferences, scope) and other information may be automatically 
   retrieved (e.g. areas of visibility). 
 
 
6.1.1. PCES TLV specific procedure 
 
   When a PCE enters into a processing congestion state, the conditions 
   of which are implementation dependent, it SHOULD originate a new IS-
   IS LSP with a Capability TLV carrying a PCES TLV with the C bit set 
   and optionally a non-null expected congestion duration. 
    
   When a PCE exists from the processing congestion state, the 
   conditions of which are implementation dependent, two cases are 
   considered: 
        - If the congestion duration in the previously originated PCES 
   TLV was null, it SHOULD originate a PCES TLV with the C bit cleared 
   and a null congestion duration; 
        - If the congestion duration in the previously originated PCES 
   TLV was non null, it MAY originate a PCES TLV. Note that in some 
   particular cases it may be desired to originate a PCES TLV with the C 
   bit cleared if the congestion duration was over estimated. 
         
   The congestion duration allows reducing the amount of IS-IS flooding, 
   as only uncongested-to-congested state transitions are advertised. 
 
   An implementation SHOULD support an appropriate dampening algorithm 
   so as to dampen IS-IS flooding in order to not impact the IS-IS 
   scalability. It is RECOMMENDED to introduce some hysteresis for 
   congestion state transition, so as to avoid state oscillations that 
   may impact IS-IS performances. For instance two thresholds MAY be 
   configured: a resource congestion upper-threshold and a resource 
   congestion lower-threshold. An LSR enters the congested state when 
   the CPU load reaches the upper threshold and leaves the congested 
   state when the CPU load goes under the lower threshold.  
    
   Upon receipt of an updated PCES TLV a PCC should take appropriate  
   actions. In particular, the PCC SHOULD stop sending requests to a   
   congested PCE, and SHOULD gradually start sending again requests to a  
   no longer congested PCE.  
       
7. Backward compatibility 
    
   The PCED and PCES TLVs defined in this document do not introduce any 
   interoperability issue.  
   An IS-IS router not supporting the PCED/PCES TLVs will just silently 
   ignore the TLV as specified in [IS-IS-CAP].

8.1.2 Sub-TLVs of the PCES sub-TLV 
    
   IANA is requested to manage sub-TLV types for the PCES TLV.  
    
   Type     Description         Reference

8.2. Capability bits 
 
   IANA is requested to manage the space of the General Capabilities  
   32-bit flag and the Path Computation Capabilities 32-bit flag defined 
   in this document, numbering them in the usual IETF notation starting 
   at zero and continuing through 31. 
   New bit numbers may be allocated only by an IETF Consensus action. 
   Each bit should be tracked with the following qualities: 
      - Bit number 
      - Defining RFC 
      - Name of bit 
       
   Currently two bits are defined in the General Capabilities flag. Here 
   are the suggested values: 
      -0: Support for Request prioritization. 
      -1: Support for multiple messages within the same request message 
    
   Currently seven bits are defined in the Path Computation Capabilities 
   flag. Here are the suggested values: 
 
      -0: Capability to handle GMPLS Constraints 
      -1: Capability to compute bidirectional paths 
      -2: Capability to compute link/node/SRLG diverse paths 
      -3: Capability to compute load-balanced paths 
      -4: Capability to compute a set of paths in a  
          synchronized Manner 
      -5: Support for multiple objective function 
      -6: Capability to handle path constraints (e.g. hop count, metric  
          bound) 
 
9. Security Considerations 
 
   Any new security issues raised by the procedures in this document 
   depend upon the opportunity for LSPs to be snooped, the 
   ease/difficulty of which has not been altered. As the LSPs may now  
   contain additional information regarding PCE capabilities, this  
   new information would also become available. Mechanisms defined to 
   secure ISIS Link State PDUs [RFC3567], and their TLVs, can be used to 
   secure PCED and PCES TLVs as well.
