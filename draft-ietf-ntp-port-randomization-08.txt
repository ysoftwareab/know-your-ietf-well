       Port Randomization in the Network Time Protocol Version 4
                  draft-ietf-ntp-port-randomization-08

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes.  Some of
   these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and
   therefore require the use of a well-known port as the local port
   number.  However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a well-
   known port is not required, employing such well-known port
   unnecessarily facilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/
   off-path attacks.  This document formally updates RFC5905,
   recommending the use of transport-protocol ephemeral port
   randomization for those modes where use of the NTP well-known port is
   not required.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest Internet
   protocols, and currently specified in [RFC5905].  Since its original
   implementation, standardization, and deployment, a number of
   vulnerabilities have been found both in the NTP specification and in
   some of its implementations [NTP-VULN].  Some of these
   vulnerabilities allow for off-path/blind attacks, where an attacker
   can send forged packets to one or both NTP peers for achieving Denial
   of Service (DoS), time-shifts, or other undesirable outcomes.  Many
   of these attacks require the attacker to guess or know at least a
   target NTP association, typically identified by the tuple {srcaddr,
   srcport, dstaddr, dstport, keyid} (see section 9.1 of [RFC5905]).
   Some of these parameters may be easily known or guessed.

   NTP can operate in several modes.  Some of these modes rely on the
   ability of nodes to receive unsolicited packets, and therefore
   require the use of the NTP well-known port (123).  However, for modes
   where the use of a well-known port is not required, employing the NTP
   well-known port unnecessarily facilitates the ability of an attacker
   to perform blind/off-path attacks (since knowledge of the port

   numbers is typically required for such attacks).  A recent study
   [NIST-NTP] that analyzes the port numbers employed by NTP clients
   suggests that a considerable number of NTP clients employ the NTP
   well-known port as their local port, or select predictable ephemeral
   port numbers, thus unnecessarily facilitating the ability of
   attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks against NTP.

   BCP 156 [RFC6056] already recommends the randomization of transport-
   protocol ephemeral ports.  This document aligns NTP with the
   recommendation in BCP 156 [RFC6056], by formally updating [RFC5905]
   such that port randomization is employed for those NTP modes for
   which the use of the NTP well-known port is not needed.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Considerations About Port Randomization in NTP

   The following subsections analyze a number of considerations about
   transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization when applied to NTP.

3.1.  Mitigation Against Off-path Attacks

   There has been a fair share of work in the area of off-path/blind
   attacks against transport protocols and upper-layer protocols, such
   as [RFC5927] and [RFC4953].  Whether the target of the attack is a
   transport protocol instance (e.g., TCP connection) or an upper-layer
   protocol instance (e.g., an application protocol instance), the
   attacker is required to know or guess the five-tuple {Protocol, IP
   Source Address, IP Destination Address, Source Port, Destination
   Port} that identifies the target transport protocol instance or the
   transport protocol instance employed by the target upper-layer
   protocol instance.  Therefore, increasing the difficulty of guessing
   this five-tuple helps mitigate blind/off-path attacks.

   As a result of these considerations, transport-protocol ephemeral
   port randomization is a best current practice (BCP 156) that helps
   mitigate off-path attacks at the transport-layer.  This document
   aligns the NTP specification [RFC5905] with the existing best current
   practice on ephemeral port selection, irrespective of other
   techniques that may (and should) be implemented for mitigating off-
   path attacks.

Internet-Draft           NTP Port Randomization                June 2021


   We note that transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization is a
   transport-layer mitigation against off-path/blind attacks, and does
   not preclude (nor is it precluded by) other possible mitigations for
   off-path attacks that might be implemented at other layers (e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization]).  For instance, some of the
   aforementioned mitigations may be ineffective against some off-path
   attacks [NTP-FRAG] or may benefit from the additional entropy
   provided by port randomization [NTP-security].

3.2.  Effects on Path Selection

   Intermediate systems implementing the Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
   algorithm may select the outgoing link by computing a hash over a
   number of values, that include the transport-protocol source port.
   Thus, as discussed in [NTP-CHLNG], the selected client port may have
   an influence on the measured offset and delay.

   If the source port is changed with each request, packets in different
   exchanges will be more likely to take different paths, which could
   cause the measurements to be less stable and have a negative impact
   on the stability of the clock.

   Network paths to/from a given server are less likely to change
   between requests if port randomization is applied on a per-
   association basis.  This approach minimizes the impact on the
   stability of NTP measurements, but may cause different clients in the
   same network synchronized to the same NTP server to have a
   significant stable offset between their clocks due to their NTP
   exchanges consistently taking different paths with different
   asymmetry in the network delay.

   Section 4 recommends NTP implementations to randomize the ephemeral
   port number of client/server associations.  The choice of whether to
   randomize the port number on a per-association or a per-request basis
   is left to the implementation.

3.3.  Filtering of NTP traffic

   In a number of scenarios (such as when mitigating DDoS attacks), a
   network operator may want to differentiate between NTP requests sent
   by clients, and NTP responses sent by NTP servers.  If an
   implementation employs the NTP well-known port for the client port
   number, requests/responses cannot be readily differentiated by
   inspecting the source and destination port numbers.  Implementation
   of port randomization for non-symmetrical modes allows for simple
   differentiation of NTP requests and responses, and for the
   enforcement of security policies that may be valuable for the

Internet-Draft           NTP Port Randomization                June 2021


   mitigation of DDoS attacks, when all NTP clients in a given network
   employ port randomization.

3.4.  Effect on NAPT devices

   Some NAPT devices will reportedly not translate the source port of a
   packet when a system port number (i.e., a port number in the range
   0-1023) [RFC6335] is employed.  In networks where such NAPT devices
   are employed, use of the NTP well-known port for the client port may
   limit the number of hosts that may successfully employ NTP client
   implementations at any given time.

   NOTES:
      NAPT devices are defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC2663].

      The reported behavior is similar to the special treatment of UDP
      port 500 that has been documented in Section 2.3 of [RFC3715].

   In the case of NAPT devices that will translate the source port even
   when a system port is employed, packets reaching the external realm
   of the NAPT will not employ the NTP well-known port as the source
   port, as a result of the port translation function performed by the
   NAPT device.

4.  Update to RFC5905

   The following text from Section 9.1 ("Peer Process Variables") of
   [RFC5905]:

      dstport: UDP port number of the client, ordinarily the NTP port
      number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  This becomes the source
      port number in packets sent from this association.

   is replaced with:

      dstport: UDP port number of the client.  In the case of broadcast
      server mode (5) and symmetric modes (1 and 2), it SHOULD contain
      the NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In the
      client mode (3), it SHOULD contain a randomized port number, as
      specified in [RFC6056].  The value in this variable becomes the
      source port number of packets sent from this association.  The
      randomized port number SHOULD NOT be shared with other
      associations, to avoid revealing the randomized port to other
      associations.

      If a client implementation performs ephemeral port randomization
      on a per-request basis, it SHOULD close the corresponding socket/
      port after each request/response exchange.  In order to prevent



Gont, et al.            Expires December 12, 2021               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           NTP Port Randomization                June 2021


      duplicate or delayed server packets from eliciting ICMP port
      unreachable error messages at the client, the client MAY wait for
      more responses from the server for a specific period of time (e.g.
      3 seconds) before closing the UDP socket/port.



      NOTES:
         Randomizing the ephemeral port number on a per-request basis
         will better mitigate off-path/blind attacks, particularly if
         the socket/port is closed after each request/response exchange,
         as recommended above.  The choice of whether to randomize the
         ephemeral port number on a per-request or a per-association
         basis is left to the implementation, and should consider the
         possible effects on path selection along with its possible
         impact on time measurement.

         On most current operating systems, which implement ephemeral
         port randomization [RFC6056], an NTP client may normally rely
         on the operating system to perform ephemeral port
         randomization.  For example, NTP implementations using POSIX
         sockets may achieve ephemeral port randomization by *not*
         binding the socket with the bind() function, or binding it to
         port 0, which has a special meaning of "any port". connect()ing
         the socket will make the port inaccessible by other systems
         (that is, only packets from the specified remote socket will be
         received by the application).

5.  Implementation Status

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication of this
   document as an RFC.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   OpenNTPD:

      [OpenNTPD] has never explicitly set the local port of NTP clients,
      and thus employs the ephemeral port selection algorithm
      implemented by the operating system.  Thus, on all operating
      systems that implement port randomization (such as current
      versions of OpenBSD, Linux, and FreeBSD), OpenNTPD will employ
      port randomization for client ports.

   chrony:
      [chrony] by default does not set the local client port, and thus
      employs the ephemeral port selection algorithm implemented by the
      operating system.  Thus, on all operating systems that implement
      port randomization (such as current versions of OpenBSD, Linux,
      and FreeBSD), chrony will employ port randomization for client
      ports.

   nwtime.org's sntp client:
      sntp does not explicitly set the local port, and thus employs the
      ephemeral port selection algorithm implemented by the operating
      system.  Thus, on all operating systems that implement port
      randomization (such as current versions of OpenBSD, Linux, and
      FreeBSD), it will employ port randomization for client ports.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of predictable numeric identifiers
   [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation] (and of predictable
   transport-protocol port numbers [RFC6056] in particular) have been
   known for a long time now.  However, the NTP specification has
   traditionally followed a pattern of employing common settings even
   when not strictly necessary, which at times has resulted in negative
   security and privacy implications (see e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization]).  The use of the NTP well-known
   port (123) for the srcport and dstport variables is not required for
   all operating modes.  Such unnecessary usage comes at the expense of
   reducing the amount of work required for an attacker to successfully
   perform off-path/blind attacks against NTP.  Therefore, this document
   formally updates [RFC5905], recommending the use of transport-
   protocol port randomization when use of the NTP well-known port is
   not required.

   This issue has been assigned CVE-2019-11331 [VULN-REPORT] in the U.S.
   National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
