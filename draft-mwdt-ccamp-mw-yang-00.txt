1. Terminology and Definitions 

   The following terms are used in this document: 

   Carrier Termination (CT) is an interface for the capacity provided 
   over the air by a single carrier. It is typically defined by its 
   transmitting and receiving frequencies. 

   Radio Link Terminal (RLT) is an interface providing packet capacity 
   and/or TDM capacity to the associated Ethernet and/or TDM interfaces 
   in a node and used for setting up a transport service over a 
   microwave/millimeter wave link. 

   The following acronyms are used in this document: 

   ACM  Adaptive Coding Modulation 

   ATPC Automatic Transmit Power Control  

   CM   Coding Modulation 

   CT   Carrier Termination

2. Introduction 

   This document defines a YANG data model for management and control 
   of the radio link interface(s) and the relationship to packet 
   (typically Ethernet) and/or TDM interfaces in a microwave/millimeter 
   wave node. The date model includes configuration and state data. 

   The design of the data model follows the framework for management 
   and control of microwave and millimeter wave interface parameters 
   defined in [I-D.mdt-ccamp-fmwk]. This framework identifies the need 
   and the scope of the YANG data model, the use cases and requirements 
   that the model needs to support. Moreover, it provides a detailed 
   gap analysis to identify the missing parameters and functionalities 
   of the existing and established models to support the specified use 
   cases and requirements, and based on that recommends how the gaps 
   should be filled with the development of the new model. 

   According to the conclusion of the gap analysis, the structure of 
   the data model is based on the structure defined in [I-D.ahlberg-
   ccamp-microwave-radio-link] and it augments RFC 7223 to align with 
   the same structure for management of the packet interfaces. More 
   specifically, the model will include interface layering to manage 
   the capacity provided by a radio link terminal for the associated 
   Ethernet and TDM interfaces, using the principles for interface 
   layering described in RFC 7223 as a basis.  

   The designed YANG data model uses the IETF: Radio Link Model [I-
   D.ahlberg-ccamp-microwave-radio-link] and the ONF: Microwave 
   Modeling [ONF-model] as the basis for the definition of the detailed 
   leafs/parameters, and proposes new ones to cover identified gaps 
   which are analyzed in [I-D.mdt-ccamp-fmwk].

5. Security Considerations 

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via 
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the 
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure 
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model 
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular 
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF 
   protocol operations and content. 

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which 
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the 
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments. Write operations (e.g., 
   <edit-config>) to these data nodes without proper protection can 
   have a negative effect on network operations. 

   The security considerations of [RFC7223] also apply to this document.
