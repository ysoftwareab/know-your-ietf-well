        LPWAN Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) for CoAP
               draft-ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc-13

Abstract

   This draft defines the way SCHC (Static Context Header Compression)
   header compression can be applied to the CoAP protocol.  SCHC is a
   header compression mechanism adapted for constrained devices.  SCHC
   uses a static description of the header to reduce the redundancy and
   the size of the information in the header.  While
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] describes the SCHC
   compression and fragmentation framework, and its application for
   IPv6/UDP headers, this document applies the use of SCHC for CoAP
   headers.  The CoAP header structure differs from IPv6 and UDP since
   CoAP uses a flexible header with a variable number of options,
   themselves of variable length.  The CoAP protocol messages format is
   asymmetric: the request messages have a header format different from
   the one in the response messages.  This specification gives guidance
   on how to apply SCHC to flexible headers and how to leverage the
   asymmetry for more efficient compression Rules.

1.  Introduction

   CoAP [rfc7252] is a transfer protocol that implements a subset of
   HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and is optimized for REST-based
   (Representational state transfer) services.  Although CoAP was
   designed for constrained devices, the size of a CoAP header still is
   too large for the constraints of LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Networks)
   and some compression is needed to reduce the header size.

   The [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] defines SCHC, a header
   compression mechanism for LPWAN network based on a static context.
   The section 5 of the [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] explains
   the architecture where compression and decompression are done.  The
   context is known by both ends before transmission.  The way the
   context is configured or exchanged is out of the scope for this
   document.

   SCHC compresses and decompresses headers based on shared contexts
   between devices.  Each context consists of multiple Rules.  Each rule
   can match header fields and specific values or ranges of values.  If
   a rule matches, the matched header fields are substituted by the rule
   ID and optionally some residual bits.  Thus, different Rules may
   correspond to different types of packets that a device expects to
   send or receive.

   A Rule describes the complete header of the packet with an ordered
   list of fields descriptions, see section 7 of the
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc], thereby each description
   contains the field ID (FID), its length (FL) and its position (FP), a
   direction indicator (DI) (upstream, downstream and bidirectional) and
   some associated Target Values (TV).

   A Matching Operator (MO) is associated to each header field
   description.  The rule is selected if all the MOs fit the TVs for all
   fields of the incoming packet.
   In that case, a Compression/Decompression Action (CDA) associated to
   each field defines how the compressed and the decompressed values are
   computed out of each other, for each of the header fields.
   Compression mainly results in one of 4 actions: * send the field
   value, * send nothing, * send some least significant bits of the
   field or * send an index.  After applying the compression there may
   be some bits to be sent, these values are called Compression
   Residues.

   SCHC is a general concept mechanism that can be applied to different
   protocols, the exact Rules to be used depend on the protocol and the
   application, and CoAP differs from UDP and IPv6, see Section 3.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [rfc2119][rfc8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Applying SCHC to CoAP

   The SCHC Compression rules can be applied to CoAP flows.  SCHC
   Compression of the CoAP header MAY be done in conjunction with the
   lower layers (IPv6/UDP) or independently.  The SCHC adaptation layers
   as described in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc]
   may be used as shown in Figure 1.

    ^   +------------+    ^  +------------+        ^  +------------+
    |   |    CoAP    |    |  |    CoAP    |  inner |  |    CoAP    |
    |   +------------+    v  +------------+        x  |    OSCORE  |
    |   |    UDP     |       |    DTLS    |  outer |  +------------+
    |   +------------+       +------------+        |  |    UDP     |
    |   |    IPv6    |       |    UDP     |        |  +------------+
    v   +------------+       +------------+        |  |    IPv6    |
                             |    IPv6    |        v  +------------+
                             +------------+



                       Figure 1: rule scope for CoAP

   Figure 1 shows some examples for CoAP architecture and the SCHC
   rule's scope.

   In the first example, a rule compresses the complete header stack
   from IPv6 to CoAP.  In this case, SCHC C/D (Static Context Header
   Compression Compressor/Decompressor) is performed at the Sender and
   at the Receiver.

   In the second example, an end-to-end encryption mechanisms is used
   between the Sender and the Receiver.  The SCHC compression is applied
   in the CoAP layer compressing the CoAP header independently of the
   other layers.  The rule ID and the compression residue are encrypted
   using a mechanism such as DTLS.  Only the other end can decipher the
   information.  Layers below may also be compressed using other SCHC

   rules (this is out of the scope of this document) as defined in the
   SCHC [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] document.

   In the third example, OSCORE [rfc8613] is used.  In this case, two
   rulesets are used to compress the CoAP message.  A first ruleset
   focused on the inner header and is applied end to end by both ends.
   A second ruleset compresses the outer header and the layers below and
   is done between the Sender and the Receiver.

3.  CoAP Compression with SCHC

   SCHC with CoAP will be used exactly the same way as it is applied in
   any protocol as IP or UDP with the difference that the fields
   description needs to be defined based on both headers and target
   values of the request and the responses.  SCHC Rules description use
   the direction information to optmize the compression by reducing the
   number of Rules needed to compress traffic.  CoAP compression follows
   the [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] scheme and as for other
   protocols, if no valid Rule was found, then the packet MUST be sent
   uncompressed using the RuleID dedicated to this purpose and the
   Compression Residue is the complete header of the packet.  See
   section 6 of [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].

3.1.  Differences between CoAP and UDP/IP

   CoAP differs from IPv6 and UDP protocols on the following aspects:

   o  IPv6 and UDP are not request and response protocols as CoAP, and
      so the same header fields are used in all packets for all
      directions, with the value of some fields being swapped on the
      return path (e.g. source and destination addresses fields).  The
      CoAP headers instead are asymmetric, the headers are different for
      a request or a response.  For example, the URI-path option is
      mandatory in the request and is not found in the response, a
      request may contain an Accept option and the response may contain
      a Content option.

      The [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] defines the use of a
      Direction Indicator (DI) in the Field Description, which allows a
      single Rule to process message headers differently depending on
      the direction.

   o  Even when a field is "symmetric" (i.e. found in both directions)
      the values carried in each direction are different.  To performs
      the compression a matching list in the TV might be use because
      this allows reducing the range of expected values in a particular
      direction and therefore reduces the size of the

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression               March 2020


      compression residue.  For instance, if a client sends only CON
      requests, the type can be elided by compression and the answer may
      use one single bit to carry either the ACK or RST type.  In CoAP
      some fields have the same behavior, for example the field Code can
      have 0.0X code format value in the request and Y.ZZ code format in
      the response.  Through the direction indicator, a field
      description in the Rules splits the possible field value in two
      parts.  Resulting in a smaller compression residue.

   o  In IPv6 and UDP, header fields have a fixed size, defined in the
      Rule, which is not sent.  In CoAP, some fields in the header have
      a variable length, for example the Token size may vary from 0 to 8
      bytes, the length is given by a field in the header.  The CoAP
      options are described using the Type-Length-Value encoding format.

      Section 7.5.2 from [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] offers
      the possibility to define a function for the Field Length in the
      Field Description to have knwoledge of the length before
      compression.  When doing SCHC compression of a variable length
      field two cases may be raised after applying the CDA: * The result
      of the compression is of fixed length and the compressed value is
      sent in the residue.  * Or the result of the compression is of
      variable-length and in this case, the size is sent with the
      compressed value in the residue.

   o  In CoAP headers, a field can appear several times.  This is
      typical for elements of a URI (path or queries).  The SCHC
      specification [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] allows a
      Field ID to appears several times in the rule, and uses the Field
      Position (FP) to identify the correct instance, and thereby
      removing the ambiguity of the matching operation.

   o  Field sizes defined in the CoAP protocol can be too large
      regarding LPWAN traffic constraints.  This is particularly true
      for the Message ID field and the Token field.  SCHC uses different
      Matching operators (MO) to performs the compression, see section
      7.4 of [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].  In this case the
      Most Significant Bits (MSB) MO can be applied to reduce the
      information carried on LP

4.  Compression of CoAP header fields

   This section discusses the compression of the different CoAP header
   fields.  The CoAP compression with SCHC follows the Section 7.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression               March 2020


4.1.  CoAP version field

   CoAP version is bidirectional and MUST be elided during the SCHC
   compression, since it always contains the same value.  In the future,
   if new versions of CoAP are defined, new rules will be needed to
   avoid ambiguities between versions.

4.2.  CoAP type field

   The CoAP Protocol [rfc7252] has four type of messages: two request
   (CON, NON); one response (ACK) and one empty message (RST).

   The field SHOULD be elided if for instance a client is sending only
   NON or only CON messages.  For the RST message a dedicated Rule may
   be needed.  For other usages a mapping list can be used.

4.3.  CoAP code field

   The code field indicates the Request Method used in CoAP, a registry
   is given in section 12.1 of [rfc7252].  The compression of the CoAP
   code field follows the same principle as that of the CoAP type field.
   If the device plays a specific role, the set of code values can be
   split in two parts, the request codes with the 0 class and the
   response values.

   If the device only implements a CoAP client, the request code can be
   reduced to the set of requests the client is able to process.

   A mapping list can be used for known values, for other values the
   field cannot be compressed an the value needs to be sent in the
   residue.

4.4.  CoAP Message ID field

   The Message ID field can be compressed with the MSB(x) MO and the
   Least Significant Bits (LSB) CDA, see section 7.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].

4.5.  CoAP Token fields

   Token is defined through two CoAP fields, Token Length in the
   mandatory header and Token Value directly following the mandatory
   CoAP header.

   Token Length is processed as any protocol field.  If the value does
   not change, the size can be stored in the TV and elided during the
   transmission.  Otherwise, it will have to be sent in the compression
   residue.

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression               March 2020


   Token Value MUST not be sent as a variable length residue to avoid
   ambiguity with Token Length.  Therefore, Token Length value MUST be
   used to define the size of the residue.  A specific function
   designated as "TKL" MUST be used in the Rule.  During the
   decompression, this function returns the value contained in the Token
   Length field.

5.  CoAP options

5.1.  CoAP Content and Accept options.

   These fields are both unidirectional and MUST NOT be set to
   bidirectional in a rule entry.

   If a single value is expected by the client, it can be stored in the
   TV and elided during the transmission.  Otherwise, if several
   possible values are expected by the client, a matching-list SHOULD be
   used to limit the size of the residue.  Otherwise, the value has to
   be sent as a residue (fixed or variable length).

5.2.  CoAP option Max-Age, Uri-Host and Uri-Port fields

   These fields are unidirectional and MUST NOT be set to bidirectional
   in a rule DI entry. see section 7.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].  They are used only by the
   server to inform of the caching duration and is never found in client
   requests.

   If the duration is known by both ends, the value can be elided on the
   LPWAN.

   A matching list can be used if some well-known values are defined.

   Otherwise these options can be sent as a residue (fixed or variable
   length).

5.3.  CoAP option Uri-Path and Uri-Query fields

   These fields are unidirectional and MUST NOT be set to bidirectional
   in a rule entry.  They are used only by the client to access a
   specific resource and are never found in server responses.

   Uri-Path and Uri-Query elements are a repeatable options, the Field
   Position (FP) gives the position in the path.

   A Mapping list can be used to reduce the size of variable Paths or
   Queries.  In that case, to optimize the compression, several elements

   can be regrouped into a single entry.  Numbering of elements do not
   change, MO comparison is set with the first element of the matching.

      +-------------+--+--+--+--------+---------+-------------+
      | Field       |FL|FP|DI| Target | Match   |     CDA     |
      |             |  |  |  | Value  | Opera.  |             |
      +-------------+--+--+--+--------+---------+-------------+
      |URI-Path     |  | 1|up|["/a/b",|equal    |not-sent     |
      |             |  |  |  |"/c/d"] |         |             |
      |URI-Path     |  | 3|up|        |ignore   |value-sent   |
      +-------------+--+--+--+--------+---------+-------------+



                      Figure 2: complex path example

   In Figure 2 a single bit residue can be used to code one of the 2
   paths.  If regrouping were not allowed, a 2 bits residue would be
   needed.

5.3.1.  Variable length Uri-Path and Uri-Query

   When the length is not known at the rule creation, the Field Length
   MUST be set to variable, and the unit is set to bytes.

   The MSB MO can be applied to a Uri-Path or Uri-Query element.  Since
   MSB value is given in bit, the size MUST always be a multiple of 8
   bits.

   The length sent at the beginning of a variable length residue
   indicates the size of the LSB in bytes.

   For instance for a CORECONF path /c/X6?k="eth0" the rule can be set
   to:

      | Field       |FL |FP|DI| Target | Match   |     CDA     |

      |URI-Path     |  8| 1|up|"c"     |equal    |not-sent     |

   Figure 3 shows the parsing and the compression of the URI, where c is
   not sent.  The second element is sent with the length (i.e. 0x2 X 6)
   followed by the query option (i.e. 0x05 "eth0").

5.3.2.  Variable number of path or query elements

   The number of Uri-path or Uri-Query elements in a rule is fixed at
   the rule creation time.  If the number varies, several rules SHOULD
   be created to cover all the possibilities.  Another possibility is to
   define the length of Uri-Path to variable and send a compression
   residue with a length of 0 to indicate that this Uri-Path is empty.
   This adds the 4 bits of the variable residue size.  See section 7.5.2
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc]

5.4.  CoAP option Size1, Size2, Proxy-URI and Proxy-Scheme fields

   These fields are unidirectional and MUST NOT be set to bidirectional
   in a rule DI entry, see section 7.1 of the
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].  They are used only by the
   client to access a specific resource and are never found in server
   response.

   If the field value has to be sent, TV is not set, MO is set to
   "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".  A mapping MAY also be used.

   Otherwise, the TV is set to the value, MO is set to "equal" and CDA
   is set to "not-sent".

5.5.  CoAP option ETag, If-Match, If-None-Match, Location-Path and
      Location-Query fields

   These fields are unidirectional.

   These fields values cannot be stored in a rule entry.  They MUST
   always be sent with the compression residues.

6.  SCHC compression of CoAP extension RFCs

6.1.  Block

   Block [rfc7959] allows a fragmentation at the CoAP level.  SCHC also
   includes a fragmentation protocol.  They are compatible.  If a block
   option is used, its content MUST be sent as a compression residue.

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression               March 2020


6.2.  Observe

   The [rfc7641] defines the Observe option.  The TV is not set, MO is
   set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "value-sent".  SCHC does not
   limit the maximum size for this option (3 bytes).  To reduce the
   transmission size, either the device implementation MAY limit the
   delta between two consecutive values, or a proxy can modify the
   increment.

   Since an RST message may be sent to inform a server that the client
   does not require Observe response, a rule MUST allow the transmission
   of this message.

6.3.  No-Response

   The [rfc7967] defines a No-Response option limiting the responses
   made by a server to a request.  If the value is known by both ends,
   then TV is set to this value, MO is set to "equal" and CDA is set to
   "not-sent".

   Otherwise, if the value is changing over time, TV is not set, MO is
   set to "ignore" and CDA to "value-sent".  A matching list can also be
   used to reduce the size.

6.4.  OSCORE

   OSCORE [rfc8613] defines end-to-end protection for CoAP messages.
   This section describes how SCHC rules can be applied to compress
   OSCORE-protected messages.

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <--------- n bytes ------------->

        | <------ CoAP OSCORE_kidctxt ----->|<-- CoAP OSCORE_kid -->|

   The encoding of the OSCORE Option Value defined in Section 6.1 of
   [rfc8613] is repeated in Figure 4.

   The first byte is used for flags that specify the contents of the
   OSCORE option.  The 3 most significant bits of this byte are reserved
   and always set to 0.  Bit h, when set, indicates the presence of the
   kid context field in the option.  Bit k, when set, indicates the
   presence of a kid field.  The 3 least significant bits n indicate the
   length of the piv (Partial Initialization Vector) field in bytes.
   When n = 0, no piv is present.

   The flag byte is followed by the piv field, kid context field and kid
   field in this order and if present; the length of the kid context
   field is encoded in the first byte denoting by s the length of the
   kid context in bytes.

   This specification recommends to identify the OSCORE Option and the
   fields it contains.

   Conceptually, it discerns up to 4 distinct pieces of information
   within the OSCORE option: the flag bits, the piv, the kid context,
   and the kid.  It is thus recommended that the parser split the OSCORE
   option into the 4 subsequent fields:

   o  CoAP OSCORE_flags,

   o  CoAP OSCORE_piv,

   o  CoAP OSCORE_kidctxt,

   o  CoAP OSCORE_kid.

   These fields are shown superimposed on the OSCORE Option format in
   Figure 4, the CoAP OSCORE_kidctxt field including the size bits s.
   Their size SHOULD be reduced using SCHC compression.

7.  Examples of CoAP header compression

7.1.  Mandatory header with CON message

   In this first scenario, the LPWAN compressor at the Network Gateway
   side receives from an Internet client a POST message, which is
   immediately acknowledged by the Device.  For this simple scenario,
   the rules are described Figure 5.

   +-------------+--+--+--+------+---------+-------------++------------+


          Figure 5: CoAP Context to compress header without token

   The version and Token Length fields are elided.  The 26 method and
   response codes defined in [rfc7252] has been shrunk to 5 bits using a
   matching list.  Uri-Path contains a single element indicated in the
   matching operator.

   SCHC Compression reduces the header sending only the Type, a mapped
   code and the least significant bits of Message ID (9 bits in the
   example above).

   Note that a request sent by a client located in an Application Server
   to a server located in the device, may not be compressed through this
   rule since the MID will not start with 7 bits equal to 0.  A CoAP
   proxy, before the core SCHC C/D can rewrite the message ID to a value
   matched by the rule.

7.2.  OSCORE Compression

   OSCORE aims to solve the problem of end-to-end encryption for CoAP
   messages.  The goal, therefore, is to hide as much of the message as
   possible while still enabling proxy operation.

   Conceptually this is achieved by splitting the CoAP message into an
   Inner Plaintext and Outer OSCORE Message.  The Inner Plaintext
   contains sensitive information which is not necessary for proxy
   operation.  This, in turn, is the part of the message which can be
   encrypted until it reaches its end destination.  The Outer Message
   acts as a shell matching the format of a regular CoAP message, and

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression               March 2020


   includes all Options and information needed for proxy operation and
   caching.  This decomposition is illustrated in Figure 6.

   CoAP options are sorted into one of 3 classes, each granted a
   specific type of protection by the protocol:

   o  Class E: Encrypted options moved to the Inner Plaintext,

   o  Class I: Integrity-protected options included in the AAD for the
      encryption of the Plaintext but otherwise left untouched in the
      Outer Message,

   o  Class U: Unprotected options left untouched in the Outer Message.

   Additionally, the OSCORE Option is added as an Outer option,
   signalling that the message is OSCORE protected.  This option carries
   the information necessary to retrieve the Security Context with which
   the message was encrypted so that it may be correctly decrypted at
   the other end-point.

   Figure 6: A CoAP message is split into an OSCORE outer and plaintext

   Figure 6 shows the message format for the OSCORE Message and
   Plaintext.

   In the Outer Header, the original message code is hidden and replaced
   by a default dummy value.  As seen in sections 4.1.3.5 and 4.2 of the
   [rfc8613], the message code is replaced by POST for requests and
   Changed for responses when Observe is not used.  If Observe is used,
   the message code is replaced by FETCH for requests and Content for
   responses.

   The original message code is put into the first byte of the
   Plaintext.  Following the message code, the class E options comes and

   if present the original message Payload is preceded by its payload
   marker.

   The Plaintext is now encrypted by an AEAD algorithm which integrity
   protects Security Context parameters and eventually any class I
   options from the Outer Header.  Currently no CoAP options are marked
   class I.  The resulting Ciphertext becomes the new Payload of the
   OSCORE message, as illustrated in Figure 7.

   This Ciphertext is, as defined in RFC 5116, the concatenation of the
   encrypted Plaintext and its authentication tag.  Note that Inner
   Compression only affects the Plaintext before encryption, thus we can
   only aim to reduce this first, variable length component of the
   Ciphertext.  The authentication tag is fixed in length and considered
   part of the cost of protection.

                         Figure 7: OSCORE message

   The SCHC Compression scheme consists of compressing both the
   Plaintext before encryption and the resulting OSCORE message after
   encryption, see Figure 8.

   This translates into a segmented process where SCHC compression is
   applied independently in 2 stages, each with its corresponding set of
   rules, with the Inner SCHC Rules and the Outer SCHC Rules.  This way
   compression is applied to all fields of the original CoAP message.

   Note that since the Inner part of the message can only be decrypted
   by the corresponding end-point, this end-point will also have to
   implement Inner SCHC Compression/Decompression.

7.3.  Example OSCORE Compression

   An example is given with a GET Request and its consequent CONTENT
   Response from a device-based CoAP client to a cloud-based CoAP
   server.  A possible set of rules for the Inner and Outer SCHC
   Compression is shown.  A dump of the results and a contrast between
   SCHC + OSCORE performance with SCHC + COAP performance is also
   listed.  This gives an approximation to the cost of security with
   SCHC-OSCORE.

   TheSCHC Rules for the Inner Compression include all fields that are
   alreadypresent in a regular CoAP message.  The methods described in
   section Section 4 applies to these fields.  As an example, see
   Figure 11.

                        Figure 11: Inner SCHC Rules

   Figure 12 shows the Plaintext obtained for our example GET Request
   and follows the process of Inner Compression and Encryption until we
   end up with the Payload to be added in the outer OSCORE Message.

   In this case the original message has no payload and its resulting
   Plaintext can be compressed up to only 1 byte (size of the Rule ID).
   The AEAD algorithm preserves this length in its first output, but
   also yields a fixed-size tag which cannot be compressed and has to be
   included in the OSCORE message.  This translates into an overhead in
   total message length, which limits the amount of compression that can
   be achieved and plays into the cost of adding security to the
   exchange.

   In Figure 13 the process is repeated for the example CONTENT
   Response.  The residue is 1 bit long.  Note that since SCHC adds
   padding after the payload, this misalignment causes the hexadecimal
   code from the payload to differ from the original, even though it has
   not been compressed.

   On top of this, the overhead from the tag bytes is incurred as
   before.

   The Outer SCHC Rules (Figure 16) MUST process the OSCORE Options
   fields.  In Figure 14 and Figure 15 we show a dump of the OSCORE
   Messages generated from our example messages once they have been
   provided with the Inner Compressed Ciphertext in the payload.  These
   are the messages that have to be compressed by the Outer SCHC
   Compression.

      Figure 15: Protected and Inner SCHC Compressed CONTENT Response

   For the flag bits, a number of compression methods has been shown to
   be useful depending on the application.  The simplest alternative is
   to provide a fixed value for the flags, combining MO equal and CDA
   not- sent.  This saves most bits but could prevent flexibility.
   Otherwise, match-mapping could be used to choose from an interested
   number of configurations to the exchange.  Otherwise, MSB could be
   used to mask off the 3 hard-coded most significant bits.

   Note that fixing a flag bit will limit the choice of CoAP Options
   that can be used in the exchange, since their values are dependent on
   certain options.

   The piv field lends itself to having a number of bits masked off with
   MO MSB and CDA LSB.  This could be useful in applications where the
   message frequency is low such as that found in LPWAN technologies.
   Note that compressing the sequence numbers effectively reduces the
   maximum amount of sequence numbers that can be used in an exchange.
   Once this amount is exceeded, the OSCORE keys need to be re-
   established.

   The size s included in the kid context field MAY be masked off with
   CDA MSB.  The rest of the field could have additional bits masked

   off, or have the whole field be fixed with MO equal and CDA not-sent.
   The same holds for the kid field.

   For contrast, we compare these results with what would be obtained by
   SCHC compressing the original CoAP messages without protecting them
   with OSCORE.  To do this, we compress the CoAP messages according to
   the SCHC rules in Figure 19.

   This yields the results in Figure 20 for the Request, and Figure 21
   for the Response.

   Compressed message:
   ==================
   0x0114
   0x01 = Rule ID

   Compression residue:
   0b00010100 (1 byte)

   Compressed msg length: 2

   Compressed message:
   ==================
   0x010a32332043
   0x01 = Rule ID

   Compression residue:
   0b00001010 (1 byte)

   Payload
   0x32332043

   Compressed msg length: 6



             Figure 21: CoAP CONTENT Compressed without OSCORE

   As can be seen, the difference between applying SCHC + OSCORE as
   compared to regular SCHC + COAP is about 10 bytes of cost.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no request to IANA.

9.  Security considerations

   This document does not have any more Security consideration than the
   ones already raised on [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].
   Variable length residues may be used to compress URI elements.  They
   cannot produce a packet expansion either on the LPWAN network or in
   the Internet network after decompression.  The length send is not
   used to indicate the information that should be reconstructed at the
   other end, but on the contrary the information sent as a Residue.
   Therefore, if a length is set to a high value, but the number of bits
   on the SCHC packet is smaller, the packet must be dropped by the
   decompressor.

   OSCORE compression is also based on the same compression method
   described in [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc].  The size of
   the Initialisation Vector residue size must be considered carefully.
   A too large value has a impact on the compression efficiency and a
   too small value will force the device to renew its key more often.
   This operation may be long and energy consuming.
