Abstract 
    
   This document describes a payload format for transporting MPEG-4 
   encoded data using RTP. MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for 
   the coding of natural and synthetic audio-visual data. Several 
   services provided by RTP are beneficial for MPEG-4 encoded data 
   transport over the Internet. Additionally, the use of RTP makes it 
   possible to synchronize MPEG-4 data with other real-time data types. 
    
   This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working 
   group within the Internet Engineering Task Force and ISO/IEC MPEG-4 
   ad hoc group on MPEG-4 over Internet. Comments are solicited and

1. Introduction 
    
   MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for the coding of natural 
   and synthetic audio-visual data in the form of audiovisual objects 
   that are arranged into an audiovisual scene by means of a scene 
   description [1][2][3][4]. This draft specifies an RTP [5] payload 
   format for transporting MPEG-4 encoded data streams. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6]. 
    
   The benefits of using RTP for MPEG-4 data stream transport include: 
    
   i. Ability to synchronize MPEG-4 streams with other RTP payloads 
    
   ii. Monitoring MPEG-4 delivery performance through RTCP 
    
   iii. Combining MPEG-4 and other real-time data streams received from 
   multiple end-systems into a set of consolidated streams through RTP 
   mixers 
    
   iv. Converting data types, etc. through the use of RTP translators. 
    
   1.1 Overview of MPEG-4 End-System Architecture 
    
   Fig. 1 below shows the general layered architecture of MPEG-4 
   terminals. The Compression Layer processes individual audio-visual 
   media streams. The MPEG-4 compression schemes are defined in the 
   ISO/IEC specifications 14496-2 [2] and 14496-3 [3]. The compression 
   schemes in MPEG-4 achieve efficient encoding over a bandwidth 
   ranging from several kbps to many Mbps. The audio-visual content 
   compressed by this layer is organized into Elementary Streams (ESs). 
   The MPEG-4 standard specifies MPEG-4 compliant streams. Within the 
   constraint of this compliance the compression layer is unaware of a 
   specific delivery technology, but it can be made to react to the 
   characteristics of a particular delivery layer such as the path-MTU 
   or loss characteristics. Also, some compressors can be designed to 
   be delivery specific for implementation efficiency. In such cases 
   the compressor may work in a non-optimal fashion with delivery 
   technologies that are different than the one it is specifically 
   designed to operate with. 
    
   The hierarchical relations, location and properties of ESs in a 
   presentation are described by a dynamic set of Object Descriptors 
   (ODs). Each OD groups one or more ES Descriptors referring to a 
   single content item (audio-visual object). Hence, multiple 
   alternative or hierarchical representations of each content item are 
   possible.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   ODs are themselves conveyed through one or more ESs. A complete set 
   of ODs can be seen as an MPEG-4 resource or session description at a 
   stream level. The resource description may itself be hierarchical, 
   i.e. an ES conveying an OD may describe other ESs conveying other 
   ODs. 
    
   The session description is accompanied by a dynamic scene 
   description, Binary Format for Scene (BIFS), again conveyed through 
   one or more ESs. At this level, content is identified in terms of 
   audio-visual objects. The spatio-temporal location of each object is 
   defined by BIFS. The audio-visual content of those objects that are 
   synthetic and static are described by BIFS also. Natural and 
   animated synthetic objects may refer to an OD that points to one or 
   more ESs that carry the coded representation of the object or its 
   animation data. 
    
   By conveying the session (or resource) description as well as the 
   scene (or content composition) description through their own ESs, it 
   is made possible to change portions of the content composition and 
   the number and properties of media streams that carry the audio- 
   visual content separately and dynamically at well known instants in 
   time. 
    
   One or more initial Scene Description streams and the corresponding 
   OD stream has to be pointed to by an initial object descriptor 
   (IOD). The IOD needs to be made available to the receivers through 
   some out-of-band means that are not defined in this document. 
    
   A homogeneous encapsulation of ESs carrying media or control (ODs, 
   BIFS) data is defined by the Sync Layer (SL) that primarily provides 
   the synchronization between streams. The Compression Layer organizes 
   the ESs in Access Units (AU), the smallest elements that can be 
   attributed individual timestamps. Integer or fractional AUs are then 
   encapsulated in SL packets.  All consecutive data from one stream is 
   called an SL-packetized stream at this layer. The interface between 
   the compression layer and the SL is called the Elementary Stream 
   Interface (ESI). The ESI is informative. 
    
   The Delivery Layer in MPEG-4 consists of the Delivery Multimedia 
   Integration Framework defined in ISO/IEC 14496-6 [4]. This layer is 
   media unaware but delivery technology aware. It provides transparent 
   access to and delivery of content irrespective of the technologies 
   used.  The interface between the SL and DMIF is called the DMIF 
   Application Interface (DAI). It offers content location independent 
   procedures for establishing MPEG-4 sessions and access to transport 
   channels. The specification of this payload format is considered as 
   a part of the MPEG-4 Delivery Layer.

1.2 MPEG-4 Elementary Stream Data Packetization 
    
   The ESs from the encoders are fed into the SL with indications of AU 
   boundaries, random access points, desired composition time and the 
   current time. 
    
   The Sync Layer fragments the ESs into SL packets, each containing a 
   header that encodes information conveyed through the ESI. If the AU 
   is larger than a SL packet, subsequent packets containing remaining 
   parts of the AU are generated with subset headers until the complete 
   AU is packetized. 
    
   The syntax of the Sync Layer is configurable and can be adapted to 
   the needs of the stream to be transported. This includes the 
   possibility to select the presence or absence of individual syntax 
   elements as well as configuration of their length in bits. The 
   configuration for each individual stream is conveyed in a 
   SLConfigDescriptor, which is an integral part of the ES Descriptor 
   for this stream. 
    
   It is assumed that the MPEG-4 SLConfigDescriptor is transported "out 
   of band". This is typically done via an ObjectDescriptorStream using 
   the MPEG-4 Object Description framework. However since some 
   knowledge of the SLConfigDescriptor is required by an RTP receiver 
   in order to parse MPEG-4 System specific elements in the RTP payload 
   defined in this document, the SLConfigDescriptor MAY be transported

   in the SDP associated with such a stream using the a=fmtp syntax 
   (see section 8). 
    
    
2. Analysis of the carriage of MPEG-4 over IP 
    
   When transporting MPEG-4 audio and video, applications may or may 
   not require the use of MPEG-4 systems. To achieve the highest level 
   of interoperability between all MPEG-4 applications, it is desirable 
   that (a) in both cases the same MPEG-4 transport format can be used 
   and that (b) receivers that have no MPEG-4 system knowledge can 
   easily skip the MPEG-4 system specific information -if any-. 
    
   RTP is perfectly suitable to transport MPEG-4 audio and MPEG-4 
   video, but when using MPEG-4 systems a problem arises from the fact 
   that both RTP and MPEG-4 systems contain a synchronization layer. 
   In particular, the RTP header duplicates some of the information 
   provided in SL packet headers such as the composition timestamps 
   (CTSs) and the marker bit that signals the end of access units. 
    
   To avoid unnecessary overhead and potential interoperability risks 
   when transporting MPEG-4 systems, it is desirable to remove the 
   redundancy between the SL packet header and the RTP packet header. 
   To be independent on the use of MPEG-4 systems, synchronization can 
   rely on the parameters provided in the RTP header. 
    
   In case SL headers are used, the redundant fields are removed from 
   the SL header, producing "reduced SL headers". 
   The remaining information from the SL header, if any, is contained 
   inside the RTP packet payload, together with the SL packet payload. 
   The combination of RTP packet headers and reduced SL packet headers 
   can be used to logically map the RTP packets to complete SL packets. 
    
   Some of the information contained in the reduced SL headers is also 
   useful for transport over RTP when MPEG-4 systems is not used. 
    
   For that reason the information in the "reduced" SL headers is split 
   into "general useful information" and "MPEG-4 systems only 
   information". 
    
   The "general useful information" hereinafter called Mapped SL Packet 
   Header (MSLH) is carried by a number of fields configurable using 
   SDP parameters; all receivers can parse these fields. 
    
   The "MPEG-4 systems only information" ûif any- is contained in a 
   reduced SL header, hereinafter called Remaining SL Packet Header 
   (RSLH), also signaled by SDP parameters and preceded by a length 
   field, so as to enable easy skipping of this information by non-
   MPEG-4 system devices. 
    
   This is depicted in figure 2.

   Figure 2: Mapping of SL Packet into RTP packet 
    
    
    
   This RTP payload format has been designed so that it can be 
   configured (using SDP parameters) to be identical to RFC 3016 for 
   the recommended MPEG-4 video configurations. Hence receivers that 
   comply with this payload specification can decode such RTP payload.  
    
    
3. Payload Format 
    
   The RTP Payload corresponds to an integer number of SL packets. 
    
   SL packets inside RTP packets MUST be in the SL stream order i.e: 
   i)   decodingTimeStamp order, if present 
   ii)  packetSequenceNumber order, if present 
   iii) Implicit decoding order in all other cases. 
    
   The SL Packet Headers are transformed into RSLH with some fields 
   extracted to be mapped in the RTP header and others extracted to be 
   mapped in the corresponding MSLH. The SL Packet Payload is 
   unchanged. 
    
   When generating SL packetized stream specifically for this format 
   all other fields in the SL Packet Headers that the RTP header does 
   not duplicate (including the decodingTimeStamp) is OPTIONAL. 
    
   This payload format has two modes. The "SingleSL" mode is a mode 
   where a single SL packet is transported per RTP packet. The 
   "MultipleSL" mode is a mode where more than one SL packet are 
   transported per RTP packet. The default mode is the Single-SL mode. 
   The mode can be set to Multiple-SL by adding in SDP a SLPPSize or 
   SLPPSizeLength parameter (see section 8).

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
    
   RTP Packets SHOULD be sent in the decoding (MPEG-4 
   decodingTimeStamp) order. 
    
   The size (or number) of the SL packet(s) SHOULD be adjusted such 
   that the resulting RTP packet is not larger than the path-MTU. To 
   handle larger packets, this payload format relies on lower layers 
   for fragmentation, which may not be desirable. 
    
3.1 RTP Header Fields Usage 
    
   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this 
   new packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will 
   not be specified here. It is expected that the RTP profile for a 
   particular class of applications will assign a payload type for this 
   encoding, or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic 
   range shall be chosen. 
    
   Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to 1 when all SL packets in the RTP 
   packet are Access Units ends i.e. the M bit maps to the SL 
   accessUnitEndFlag. 
    
   M is set to 1 when the RTP packet contains either: 
   . a single SL packet containing a full Access Unit 
   . a single SL packet transporting the last fragment of an Access 
   Unit 
   . multiple SL packets each containing a full Access Unit 
   . multiple SL packets each containing the last fragment of an Access 
   Unit 
   . multiple SL packets each containing either a full Access Unit or 
   the last fragment of an Access Unit 
    
   The last 2 cases occur when using specific interleaving schemes. In 
   some interleaving schemes it may not be practical to reshuffle the 
   SL packets so as to group Access Unit ends in the same RTP packet. 
   In that case, Access Unit boundaries -if needed- can be transported 
   using one or both of the SL flags accessUnitStartFlag and 
   accessUnitEndFlag. 
    
   Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used. 
    
   Sequence Number: The RTP sequence number should be generated by the 
   sender with a constant random offset and does not have to be 
   correlated to any (optional) MPEG-4 SL sequence numbers. 
    
   Timestamp: Set to the value in the compositionTimeStamp field of the 
   first SL packet, if present. If compositionTimeStamp has less than 
   32 bits length, the MSBs of timestamp MUST be set to zero. 
    
   Although it is available from the SL configuration data, the 
   resolution of the timestamp may need to be conveyed explicitly 
   through some out-of-band means to be used by network elements which 
   are not MPEG-4 aware. 
  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                         7 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
    
   If compositionTimeStamp has more than 32 bits length, this payload 
   format cannot be used. 
    
   In all cases, the sender SHALL always make sure that RTP time stamps 
   are identical only for RTP packets transporting fragments of the 
   same Access Unit. 
    
   In case compositionTimeStamp is not present in the current SL 
   packet, but has been present in a previous SL packet the reason is 
   that this is the same Access Unit that has been fragmented therefore 
   the same timestamp value MUST be taken as RTP timestamp. 
    
   If compositionTimeStamp is never present in SL packets for this 
   stream, the RTP packetizer SHOULD convey a reading of a local clock 
   at the time the RTP packet is created. 
    
   According to RFC1889 [5, Section 5.1] timestamps are recommended to 
   start at a random value for security reasons. However then, a 
   receiver is not in the general case able to reconstruct the original 
   MPEG-4 Time Stamps (CTS, DTS, OCR) which can be of use for 
   applications where streams from multiple sources are to be 
   synchronized. Therefore the usage of such a random offset SHOULD be 
   avoided. 
    
   Note that since RTP devices may re-stamp the stream, all time stamps 
   inside of the RTP payload (CTS and DTS in MSLH, OCR in RSLH) MUST be 
   expressed as difference to the RTP time stamp. Since this 
   subtraction may lead to negative values, the offset MUST be encoded 
   as a two's complement signed integer in network byte order. Note 
   these offsets (delta) typically require much fewer bits to be 
   encoded than the original length, which is another justification. 
    
   SSRC: set as described in RFC1889 [5]. A mapping between the ES 
   identifiers (ESIDs) and SSRCs should be provided through out-of-band 
   means. 
    
   CC and CSRC fields are used as described in RFC 1889 [5]. 
    
   RTCP SHOULD be used as defined in RFC 1889 [5]. 
    
   RTP timestamps in RTCP SR packets: according to the RTP timing 
   model, the RTP timestamp that is carried into an RTCP SR packet is 
   the same as the compositionTimeStamp that would be applied to an RTP 
   packet for data that was sampled at the instant the SR packet is 
   being generated and sent. The RTP timestamp value is calculated from 
   the NTP timestamp for the current time, which also goes in the RTCP 
   SR packet. To perform that calculation, an implementation needs to 
   periodically establish a correspondence between the CTS value of a 
   data packet and the NTP time at which that data was sampled.

3.2 RTP payload structure 
    
       
   The packet payload structure consists of 3 byte-aligned sections. 
    
   The first section is the MSLHSection and contains Mapped SL Packet 
   Headers (MSLH). The MSLH structure is described in 3.3. In the 
   Single-SL mode this section is empty by default. 
    
   The second section is the RSLHSection and contains Remaining SL 
   Headers (RSLH). The RSLH structure is described in 3.5. By default 
   this section is empty. 
    
   The last section (SLPPSection) contains the SL packet payloads. This 
   section is never empty. 
    
   The Nth MSLH in the MSLHSection, the Nth RSLH in the RSLHSection and 
   the Nth SL packet payload in the SLPPSection correspond to the Nth 
   SL packet transported by the RTP packet.

   In the general case a receiver can only discover the size of a MSLH 
   by parsing it since for example the presence of CTSDelta is signaled 
   by the value of CTSFlag. 
    
    
3.4.1 Fields of MSLH 
    
   SLPPayloadSize (SL Packet Payload Size): Indicates the size in bytes 
   of the associated SL Packet Payload, which can be found in the 
   SLPPSection of the RTP packet. The length in bits of this field is 
   signaled in SDP by the SLPPSizeLength SDP parameter (see section 8). 
    
   SLPSeqNum/SLPSeqNumDelta: Encodes the packetSequenceNumber (serial 
   number) of the SL Packet. 
    
   SLPSeqNum is found only for the first SL packet. SLPSeqNumDelta is 
   optional and -if present- appears for subsequent (non-first) SL 
   packets. 
    
   The length in bits of the SLPSeqNum field is defined by the 
   SLPSeqNumLength SDP parameter (see section 8). 
    
   The length in bits of the SLPSeqNumDelta field is defined by the 
   SLPSeqNumDeltaLength SDP parameter (see section 8). 
    
   If the parameter SLPSeqNumDeltaLength is defined in SDP, non-first 
   SL packets have their packetSequenceNumber encoded as a difference 
   named SLPSeqNumDelta. This difference is relative to the previous SL 
   packet in the RTP packet according to (with i>=0): 
   packetSequenceNumber(0) = SLPSeqNum(0)    
   packetSequenceNumber(i+1) = packetSequenceNumber(i) + 
   SLPSeqNumDelta(i+1) + 1    
    
   If the parameter SLPSeqNumDeltaLength is not defined in SDP the 
   default value is zero i.e. this field is not present for non-first 
   SL packets. Furthermore receivers SHALL then apply the above formula 
   with SLPSeqNumDelta equal to zero i.e. by default 
   packetSequenceNumber is incremented by 1 for each SL packet in one 
   RTP packet. This means that for streams that use 
   packetSequenceNumber and are not interleaved the transport of 
   packetSequenceNumber in the Multiple-SL mode is "almost free".

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
    
   CTSFlag (1 bit): Indicates whether the CTSDelta field is present. A 
   value of 1 indicates that the field is present, a value of 0 that it 
   is not present. 
    
   This field -if present- appears for all SL packets since the 
   receiver needs it to reconstruct the compositionTimeStampFlag of SL 
   Headers. 
    
   CTSDelta: Specifies the value of the CTS as a 2-complement offset 
   (delta) from the timestamp in the RTP header of this RTP packet. 
   The length in bits of each CTSDelta field is specified in SDP by the 
   CTSDeltaLength parameter (see section 8). 
    
   This field -if present- appears only for non-first SL packets since 
   the composition time stamp of the first SL packet is mapped to the 
   RTP time stamp, regardless of whether CTSFlag is 1. The sender MUST 
   remove the compositionTimeStamp from the corresponding RSLH. 
 
   DTSFlag (1 bit): Indicates whether the DTSDelta field is present. A 
   value of 1 indicates that DTSDelta is present, a value of 0 that it 
   is not present. 
    
   This field -if present- appears for all SL packets since it is 
   needed by the receiver to reconstruct the decodingTimeStampFlag. 
    
   DTSDelta: Specifies the value of the decodingTimeStamp as a 2 
   complement offset (delta) from the timestamp in the RTP header of 
   this packet. The length in bits of each DTSDelta field is specified 
   in SDP by the DTSDeltaLength parameter (see section 8). 
    
   This field appears when DTSFlag is 1. Then the sender MUST remove 
   the decodingTimeStamp from the corresponding RSLH.

   Synchronization Layer (SL) syntax and the modifications to this 
   syntax described in the next section (3.6). 
    
   However thanks to the RSLHSize field non-MPEG-4-system receivers MAY 
   skip this part by rounding up RSLPHSize/8 to the next integer number 
   of bytes.  
       
    
3.6 RSLH structure 
    
   A Remaining SL Packet Header (RSLH) is what remains of an SL header 
   after modifications for mapping into this payload format.  
    
   The following modifications of the SL packet header MUST be applied. 
   The other fields of the SL packet header MUST remain unchanged but 
   are bit-shifted to fill in the gaps left by the operations specified 
   below. 
    
3.6.1 Removal of fields 
    
   The following SL Packet Header fields -if present- are removed since 
   they are mapped either in the RTP header or in the corresponding 
   MSLH: 
   . compositionTimeStampFlag 
   . compositionTimeStamp 
   . decodingTimeStampFlag 
   . decodingTimeStamp 
   . packetSequenceNumber 
    
     
3.6.2 Mapping of OCR 
    
   Furthermore if the SL Packet header contains an OCR, then this field 
   is encoded in the RSLH as a 2-complement difference (delta) exactly 
   like a compositionTimeStamp or a decodingTimeStamp in the MSLH. The 
   length in bit of this difference is indicated by the OCRDeltaLength 
   parameter in SDP (see section 8). 
    
   With this payload format OCRs MUST have the same clock resolution as 
   Time Stamps. 
    
   If compositionTimeStamp is not present for a SL packet that has OCR 
   then the OCR SHALL be encoded as a difference to the RTP time stamp. 
    
3.6.3 Degradation Priority 
    
   For streams that use the optional degradationPriority field in the 
   SL Packet Headers, only SL packets with the same degradation 
   priority SHALL be transported by one RTP packet so that components 
   may dispatch the RTP packets according to appropriate QOS or 
   protection schemes. Furthermore only the first RSLH of one RTP 
   packet SHALL contain the degradationPriority field since it would be 
   otherwise redundant.

3.7 SLPPSection structure 
    
   The SLPPSection (SL Packet Payload Section) contains the 
   concatenated SL Packet Payloads. By definition SL Packet Payloads 
   are byte aligned. 
    
   For efficiency SL packets do not carry their own payload size. This 
   is not an issue for RTP packets that contain a single SL Packet. 
    
   However in the Multiple-SL mode the size of each SL packet payload 
   MUST be available to the receiver. 
    
   If the SL packet payload size is constant for a stream, the size 
   information SHOULD NOT be transported in the RTP packet. However in 
   that case it MUST be signaled in SDP using a (a=fmtp:<format> 
   SLPPSize=<value>) syntax (see section 8). 
    
   If the SL packet payload size is variable then the size of each SL 
   packet payload MUST be indicated in the corresponding MSLH. In order 
   to do so the MSLH MUST contain a SLPPayloadSize field. The number of 
   bits on which this SLPPayloadSize field is encoded MUST be indicated 
   in the corresponding SDP using a (a=fmtp:<format> 
   SLPPSizeLength=<value>) syntax (see section 8). 
    
   The absence of either SLPPSize or SLPPSizeLength in SDP indicates 
   the Single-SL mode i.e. that a single SL packet is transported in 
   each RTP packet for that stream.

   SL Packets MAY be interleaved. Senders MAY perform interleaving. 
   Receivers MUST support interleaving. 
    
   When interleaving of SL packets is used it SHALL be implemented 
   using the SLPSeqNum field of MSLH. 
    
   The AUSequenceNumber field of the SL header MUST NOT be used for 
   interleaving since firstly it may collide with BIFS Carousel usage 
   and secondly it is not visible to non-MPEG-4 system receivers. 
    
   The conjunction of RTP sequence number and SLPSeqNum can produce a 
   quasi-unique identifier for each SL packet so that a receiver can 
   unambiguously reconstruct the original order even in case of out-of-
   order packets, packet loss or duplication. 
    
3.9 Fragmentation Rules 
    
   MPEG-4 Access Units are the default fragments for MPEG-4 bitstreams 
   and SHOULD be mapped one-to-one to RTP packets of this format with 
   two exceptions: 
   - Access Units larger than the MTU, 
   - When using interleaving for better packet loss resilience. 
    
   In all cases Access Unit start MUST be aligned with SL packet start. 
    
   This section gives rules to apply when performing Access Unit 
   fragmentation. 
    
   Some MPEG-4 codecs define optional syntax for Access Units sub-
   entities (fragments) that are independently decodable for error 
   resilience purposes. Examples are Video Packets for video and Error 
   Sensitivity Categories (ESC) for audio. This always corresponds to 
   specific bitstream syntax, which is signaled in the 
   DecoderSpecificInfo inside the DecoderConfig in SLConfig, and/or 
   using the corresponding SDP parameters as described in section 8. 
   Therefore encoders and decoders are both aware whether they are 
   operating in such a mode or not (however since this codec 
   configuration is an opaque data block this is not explicitly 
   signaled by this payload format). 
    
   If not operating in such a mode it is obvious that the decoder has 
   to skip packets after a loss until an Access Unit start is received. 
   Similarly decoder implementations that do not implement robust 
   decoding of Access Units fragments have to discard all packets after 
   a packet loss until an Access Unit start is received. In the same 
   way decoder implementations that do not implement re-synchronization 
   at any Access Units start have to discard all packets after a packet 
   loss until a Random Access Point Access Unit is received. 
    
   One problem would arise however for decoder implementations that try 
   to restart decoding after a packet loss if independently decodable 
   fragments are signaled (in the decoder configuration) but the 
   fragments actually received are not independently decodable because

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   the RTP sender has made RTP packets on different boundaries than the 
   fragments provided by the encoder. 
    
   For this reason the following rules must apply to SL streams that 
   are specifically made for transport with this payload format: 
    
   SL packets SHOULD be codec-semantic entities in the spirit of ALF 
   i.e. either complete Access Units or fragments of Access Units that 
   are independently decodable. Specifically when a given codec has an 
   independently decodable Access Unit fragments optional syntax this 
   option SHOULD be used. 
    
   Furthermore when streams are generated using independently decodable 
   Access Units fragments these Access Units fragments MUST be mapped 
   one-to-one into SL packets. Consequently independently decodable 
   Access Units fragments MUST NOT be split across several SL packets 
   and therefore MUST NOT be split across several RTP packets. 
    
   For example an MPEG-4 audio stream encoded using the ESC syntax MUST 
   NOT split one ESC across 2 RTP packets. 
    
   This rule is relaxed when using MPEG-4 Video Packets for two 
   reasons: firstly Video Packets can be much larger than typical MTU 
   and secondly all Video Packets start with a specific 
   resynchronization marker that can be unambiguously detected. 
   Therefore for video streams using the Video Packet syntax Video 
   Packets MAY be split across several SL packets although it is 
   strongly RECOMMENDED to always adapt the Video Packet size to fit 
   the MTU. In all cases a Video Packet start MUST always be aligned 
   with a SL packet start. 
    
   The rule is maintained for video Data Partitions since the second 
   Data Partition of a Video Packet does not start with a non-emulable 
   resynchronization marker. 
    
    
    
4. SL packetized stream reconstruction 
    
   The MPEG-4 over IP framework [9] requires that the way a receiver 
   can reconstruct a valid SL packetized stream shall be documented, 
   this is the purpose of this section. 
    
   Since this format directly transports SL packets this reconstruction 
   is trivial with the following rules: 
    
   - SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber is restored from 
   MSLH.SLPSeqNum for the first SL packet in the RTP packet (i= 0): 
   SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber(0) = MSLH.SLPSeqNum(0) 
   and for subsequent packets using (for i>=0) : 
   SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber(i+1) = 
   SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber(i) + MSLH.SLPSeqNumDelta(i+1) +1

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   - All time stamps (CTS, DTS, OCR), when present, are restored from 
   the delta values. 
   - Time stamps flags (CTSFlag, DTSFlag) in MSLH are used to 
   reconstruct respectively the compositionTimeStampFlag and 
   decodingTimeStampFlag of SLPacketHeader. 
    
   Specifically the reconstruction depends on the SDP parameters as 
   follows: 
    
   If SDP.CTSDeltaLength is absent or equals 0: 
   The SL stream reconstruction rules are: 
   . for the first (or only) SL packet:  
    . if SLConfig.useTimeStamps == true, then: 
     . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag = true 
     . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStamp = RTP TimeStamp 
    . if SLConfig.useTimeStamps == false, then: 
     . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag is not defined 
   . for the following SL packets: 
    . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag = false 
    
   If SDP.CTSDeltaLength is not zero: 
    . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag = MSLH.CTSFlag 
    . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStamp = RTP TimeStamp + 
   MSLH.CTSDelta 
    
   - The other SL packet header fields SHALL remain as found in RSLH. 
    
   It is obvious that in the general case the reconstruction of the 
   original SL packetized stream requires SL-awareness. However this 
   payload format allows in all cases a receiver that does not know 
   about the SL syntax to reconstruct the semantic of SL for the 
   following very useful features: 
   - Packet order (decoding order) 
   - Access Unit boundaries (using the M bit) 
   - Access Unit fragments (i.e. SL packet boundaries using 
   MSLH.SLPPayloadSize) 
   - Composition Time Stamps (using the RTP Time Stamp and 
   MSLH.CTSDelta) 
   - Decoding Time Stamps (using the RTP Time Stamp and MSLH.DTSDelta) 
   - Packet sequence number (using the RTP Time Sequence number and 
   MSLH.SLPSeqNum) 
    
    
5. Other issues 
 
5.1 Handling of scene description streams 
    
   MPEG-4 introduces new stream types as described in section 1 namely 
   Object Descriptors and BIFS. In the following both OD and BIFS are 
   discussed on the same basis i.e. as ôscene descriptionö. 
    


  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                        18 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   Considering Scene description as a ôstream-ableö type of content is 
   a rather new concept and for that reasons some specific comments are 
   needed. 
    
   In the past scene description has been formatted (encoded) in such a 
   way that information loss would in the general case cripple the 
   presentation beyond any hope of repair by the receiver. Still this 
   type of encoding is well suited for a number of multimedia 
   applications were the scene is first made available via reliable 
   channels to the client and then played. This payload format is not 
   intended for this type of applications but can be used if the RTP 
   packets are transported using TCP or any other reliable protocol. 
    
   MPEG-4 in contrast has introduced the possibility to dynamically 
   change the scene description by sending animation information 
   (changes in parameters) and structural change information (updates). 
   Since this information has to be sent in a timely fashion MPEG-4 has 
   defined a number of techniques in order to encode the scene 
   description in a manner that makes it behave similarly to other 
   temporal encoding schemes such as audio and video. This payload 
   format is intended for this usage. 
    
   Note that in many cases the application will consist of first the 
   reliable transmission of a static initial scene followed by the 
   streaming of animations and updates. For this reason the usage of 
   this payload format in both cases offers a useful unique solution. 
    
   Senders must be aware that suitable schemes should be used when 
   scene description streams transport sensitive configuration 
   information, for example in case the RTP packet transporting an OD-
   update command signaling a new media subject would be lost the 
   corresponding media stream would not be accessible by the receiver.  
 
   Redundancy is a possibility and may either be added by tools 
   hierarchically higher than this payload format, e.g. by packet based 
   FEC, re-transmission, or similar tools. In such a case, the general 
   congestion control principles have to be observed. 
    
   MPEG-4 also defines Random Access Points (RAP) for scene description 
   streams (OD and BIFS) where by definition a decoder can restart 
   decoding i.e. receives a ôfull updateö of the scene. The periodicity 
   of transmission of these RAPs can be calculated by observing 
   parameters such as the packet loss rate and the number of receivers. 
   Just as for video where the periodicity of so called Intra Frame 
   defines the robustness to errors it is the responsibility of the 
   sender to make sure the periodicity of RAPs is suitable. 
 
5.2 Multiplexing 
    
   An advanced MPEG-4 session may involve a large number of objects 
   that may be as many as a few hundred, transporting each ES as an 
   individual RTP stream may not always be practical. Allocating and 

  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                        19 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   controlling hundreds of destination addresses for each MPEG-4 
   session may pose insurmountable session administration problems. 
   The input/output processing overhead at the end-points will be 
   extremely high also. Additionally, low delay transmission of low 
   bitrate data streams, e.g. facial animation parameters, results in 
   extremely high header overheads. 
    
   To solve these problems, MPEG-4 data transport requires a 
   multiplexing scheme that allows selective bundling of several ESs. 
   This is beyond the scope of the payload format defined here. 
    
   The MPEG-4's Flexmux multiplexing scheme may be used for this 
   purpose and a specific RTP payload format is being developed [11].  
    
   Another approach may be to develop a generic RTP multiplexing scheme 
   usable for MPEG-4 data. The multiplexing scheme reported in [8] may 
   be a candidate for this approach. 
    
   For MPEG-4 applications, the multiplexing technique needs to address 
   the following requirements: 
    
   i. The ESs multiplexed in one stream can change frequently during a 
   session. Consequently, the coding type, individual packet size and 
   temporal relationships between the multiplexed data units must be 
   handled dynamically. 
    
   ii. The multiplexing scheme should have a mechanism to determine the 
   ES identifier (ES_ID) for each of the multiplexed packets. ES_ID is 
   not a part of the SL header. 
    
   iii. In general, an SL packet does not contain information about its 
   size. The multiplexing scheme should be able to delineate the 
   multiplexed packets whose lengths may vary from a few bytes to close 
   to the path-MTU. 
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [5]. This implies that confidentiality of the media 
   streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression used 
   with this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be 
   performed on the compressed data so there is no conflict between the 
   two operations. The packet processing complexity of this payload 
   type does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in the receiver 
   side to cause a denial-of-service threat. 
    
   However, it is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, 
   Video, and Systems) to overload the receiver/decoder's buffers which 
   might compromise the functionality of the receiver or even crash it. 
   This is especially true for end-to-end systems like MPEG where the 
   buffer models are precisely defined.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
    
   MPEG-4 Systems supports stream types including commands that are 
   executed on the terminal like OD commands, BIFS commands, etc. and 
   programmatic content like MPEG-J (Java(TM) Byte Code) and 
   ECMASCRIPT. It is possible to use one or more of the above in a 
   manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash or temporarily make the 
   receiver unavailable. 
    
   Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of the sender and 
   the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant 
   MPEG-4 streams. 
    
   A security model is defined in MPEG-4 Systems streams carrying MPEG-
   J access units which comprises Java(TM) classes and objects. MPEG-J 
   defines a set of Java APIs and a secure execution model.  MPEG-J 
   content can call this set of APIs and Java(TM) methods from a set of 
   Java packages supported in the receiver within the defined security 
   model. According to this security model, downloaded byte code is 
   forbidden to load libraries, define native methods, start programs, 
   read or write files, or read system properties. 
    
   Receivers can implement intelligent filters to validate the buffer 
   requirements or parametric (OD, BIFS, etc.) or programmatic (MPEG-J, 
   ECMAScript) commands in the streams. However, this can increase the 
   complexity significantly. 
    
7. Types and names 
    
   The encoding name associated to this RTP payload format is: 
   - "mpeg4-sl". 
    
   The media type may be any of: 
   - "video" 
   - "audio" 
   - "application" 
    
   "video" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Video streams (ISO/IEC 14496-2) or 
   MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information needed for an 
   audio/visual presentation. 
    
   "audio" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Audio streams (ISO/IEC 14496-3) or 
   MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information needed for an audio-
   only presentation. 
    
   "application" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Systems streams (ISO/IEC 
   14496-1) that serve other purposes than audio/visual presentation, 
   e.g. in some cases when MPEG-J streams are transmitted. 
    
    
8. Additional SDP syntax 
    
8.1 Mapping information

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   This format may require additional information about the mapping to 
   be made available to the receiver. This is signaled to the receiver 
   using SDP (a=fmtp) parameters as in RFC 2327 [10, section 6]. 
    
   The absence of any of these fields in SDP is similar to a field set 
   to the default value, which is always zero. 
    
   The absence of any such parameters resolves into a default "basic" 
   configuration. 
    
8.1.1 Indication of DTSDelta bit length 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> DTSDeltaLength=<value> 
    
   <value> being the number of bits on which the DTSDelta field is 
   encoded in MSLH. The default value is zero and indicates the absence 
   of DTSFlag and DTSDelta in MSLH (the stream does not transport 
   decodingTimeStamps). A value larger than zero indicates that there 
   is a DTSFlag in each MSLH. 
    
   Since decodingTimeStamp -if present- must be encoded as a difference 
   to the RTP time stamp, the DTSDeltaLength parameter MUST be present 
   in SDP in order to transport decodingTimeStamps with this payload 
   format. 
    
8.1.2 Indication of CTSDelta bit length 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> CTSDeltaLength=<value> 
    
   <value> being the number of bits on which the CTSDelta field is 
   encode in (non-first) MSLH. The default value is zero and indicates 
   the absence of the CTSFlag and CTSDelta fields in MSLH (the mode is 
   Single-SL or the stream does not transport compositionTimeStamps). 
    
   Since compositionTimeStamps -if present- must be encoded as a 
   difference to the RTP time stamp, the CTSDeltaLength parameter MUST 
   be present in SDP in order to transport compositionTimeStamps using 
   this payload format (in the Multiple-SL mode). 
    
8.1.3 Indication of OCRDelta bit length 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> OCRDeltaLength=<value> 
    
   <value> being the number of bits on which the OCRDelta field is 
   encoded in RSLH. The default value is zero and indicates the absence 
   of OCR for this stream.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   Since objectClockReference -if present- must be encoded as a 
   difference to the RTP time stamp, the OCRDeltaLength parameter MUST 
   be present in SDP in order to transport objectClockReferences with 
   this payload format. 
    
8.1.4 Indication of SLPPayloadSize bit length 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> SLPPSizeLength=<value> 
    
   <value> being the number of bits on which the SLPPayloadSize field 
   of MSLH is encoded. The default value is zero and indicates the 
   Single-SL mode (unless SLPPSize is present in SDP). 
    
   Simultaneous presence in SDP of this parameter and SLPPSize is 
   illegal. 
    
   Either the SLPPSizeLength or SLPPSize parameter MUST be present in 
   SDP in order to signal the Multiple-SL mode of this payload format. 
    
8.1.5 Indication of constant SL packet size 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> SLPPSize=<value> 
    
   <value> being the constant size in bytes of each SL Packet Payload 
   for this stream. The default value is zero and indicates variable SL 
   Packet Payload size (or the Single-SL mode if SLPPSizeLength is 
   absent). 
 
   Simultaneous presence in SDP of this parameter and SLPPSizeLength is 
   illegal. 
    
   Either the SLPPSizeLength or SLPPSize parameter MUST be present in 
   SDP in order to signal the Multiple-SL mode of this payload format. 
    
   When SLPPSize is present in SDP the SLPPayloadSize of MSLH in the 
   RTP packets MUST NOT be present. 
    
8.1.6 Indication of SLPSeqNum bit length 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> SLPSeqNumLength=<value> 
    
   <value> being the number of bits on which the SLPSeqNum is encoded 
   in the first MSLH. The default value is zero and indicates the 
   absence of SLPSeqNum and SLPSeqNumDelta for all MSLHs.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
   Since packetSequenceNumber -if present- must be mapped in MSLH, the 
   SLPSeqNumLength parameter MUST be present in SDP in order to 
   transport packetSequenceNumber with this payload format. 
    
    
8.1.7 Indication of SLPSeqNumDelta bit length 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> SLPSeqNumDeltaLength=<value> 
    
   <value> being the number of bits on which the SLPSeqNumDelta are 
   encoded in any non-first MSLH. The default value is zero and 
   indicates that packetSequenceNumber MUST be incremented by one for 
   each SL packet in the RTP packet (see section 3.5). 
    
   Since when interleaving packetSequenceNumber does not increment by 1 
   inside a RTP packet, the SLPSeqNumDeltaLength parameter MUST be 
   present in SDP when using interleaving with this payload format. 
    
8.1.8 Indication of RSLHSize bit length 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> RSLHSizeLength=<value> 
    
   <value> being the number of bits that is used to encode the RSLHSize 
   field. The default value is zero and indicates the absence of the 
   whole RSLHSection for all RTP packets of this stream. 
    
   Compatibility with RFC 3016 requires that the RSLHSection is empty, 
   including the RSLHSize field. This is the reason why there is such a 
   variable length with a default value indicating absence of the 
   RSLHSize field. 
 
8.2 Optional configuration information 
    
   In the MPEG-4 framework the following information is carried using 
   the Object Descriptor. For compatibility with receivers that do not 
   implement the full MPEG-4 system specification this information MAY 
   also be indicated in SDP. 
    
   For transport of MPEG-4 audio and video without the use of MPEG-4 
   systems, as well as to support non-MPEG-4 system receivers, it is 
   possible to transport information on the profile and level of the 
   stream and on the decoder configuration. 
    
8.2.1 Indication of SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   Senders MAY transmit the SLConfigDescriptor in SDP. 
    
   The following syntax shall be used:

   a=fmtp:<format> SLConfigDescriptor=<value> 
    
   <value> being a base-64 encoding of the SLConfigDescriptor. This 
   SHALL be the original SLConfigDescriptor and it SHALL be the same as 
   the one transported by the OD framework. 
    
8.2.2 Indications for MPEG-4 audio streams 
    
8.2.2.1 Indication of profile level 
    
   Senders MAY transmit the profile and level indication in SDP. 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> profile-level-id=<value> 
    
   <value> being a decimal representation of the MPEG-4 Audio Profile 
   Level indication value defined in ISO/IEC 14496-1. This parameter 
   indicates which MPEG-4 Audio tool subsets are applied to encode the 
   audio stream. 
    
8.2.2.2 Indication of audio object type 
    
   Senders MAY transmit the audio object type indication in SDP. 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> object-type=<value> 
    
   <value> being a  decimal representation of the MPEG-4 Audio Object 
   Type value defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3. This parameter specifies the 
   tool used by the encoder. It CAN be used to limit the capability 
   within the specified "profile-level-id". 
    
8.2.2.3 Indication of audio bitrate 
    
   Senders MAY transmit the audio bitrate in SDP. 
    
   The following syntax shall be used: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> bitrate=<value> 
    
   <value> being a decimal representation of the audio bitrate in bits

9. Examples of usage of this payload format 
    
   This payload format has been designed to transport with flexibility 
   a very versatile packetization scheme (the MPEG-4 Synchronization 
   Layer); its complexity is therefore larger than the average for RTP 
   payload formats. For this reason this section describes a number of 
   key examples of how this payload format can be used. 
 
9.1 MPEG-4 Video 
    
   Let us consider the case of a 30 frames per second MPEG-4 video 
   stream which bit rate is high enough that Access Units have to be 
   split in several SL packets (typically above 300 kb/s). 
    
   Let us assume also that the video codec generates in that case Video 
   Packets suitable to fit in one SL packet i.e that the video codec is 
   MTU aware and the MTU is 1500 bytes. We assume furthermore that this 
   stream contains B frames and that decodingTimeStamps are present. 
    
9.1.1 SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 1

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      March 2001 
 
 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useRandomAccessPointFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) usePaddingFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useTimeStampsFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useIdleFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) durationFlag; = 0 
     bit(32) timeStampResolution; = 30 
     bit(32) OCRResolution; = 0 
     bit(8) timeStampLength; = 32 
     bit(8) OCRLength; = 0 
     bit(8) AU_Length; = 0 
     bit(8) instantBitrateLength; = 0 
     bit(4) degradationPriorityLength; = 0 
     bit(5) AU_seqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(5) packetSeqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(2) reserved=0b11; 
    } 
    if (durationFlag) { 
     bit(32) timeScale; // NOT USED 
     bit(16) accessUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
     bit(16) compositionUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
    } 
    if (!useTimeStampsFlag) { 
     bit(timeStampLength) startDecodingTimeStamp; = 0 
     bit(timeStampLength) startCompositionTimeStamp; = 0 
    } 
   } 
    
   The useRandomAccessPointFlag is set so that the 
   randomAccessPointFlag can indicate that the corresponding SL packet 
   contains a GOV and the first Video Packet of an Intra coded frame. 
    
9.1.2 SL Packet Header structure 
    
   With this configuration we have the following SL packet header 
   structure: 
    
   aligned(8) class SL_PacketHeader (SLConfigDescriptor SL) { 
    if (SL.useAccessUnitStartFlag) { 
     bit(1) accessUnitStartFlag; // 1 bit 
    } 
    if (accessUnitStartFlag) { 
     if (SL.useRandomAccessPointFlag) { 
      bit(1) randomAccessPointFlag; // 1 bit 
     } 
     if (SL.useTimeStampsFlag) { 
      bit(1) decodingTimeStampFlag; // 1 bit 
      bit(1) compositionTimeStampFlag; // 1 bit 
     } 
     if (decodingTimeStampFlag) { 
      bit(SL.timeStampLength) decodingTimeStamp; 
     }

     if (compositionTimeStampFlag) { 
      bit(SL.timeStampLength) compositionTimeStamp; 
     } 
    } 
   } 
    
9.1.3 SDP mapping information 
    
   decodingTimeStamps are encoded on 32 bits, which is much more than 
   needed for delta. Therefore the sender will use DTSDeltaLength in 
   the corresponding SDP to signal that only 6 bits are used for the 
   coding of relative DTS in the RTP packet. 
    
   The RSLHSize cannot exceed 2 bits, which is encoded on 2 bits and 
   signaled by RSLHSizeLength. The resulting concatenated fmtp line is: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> DTSDeltaLength=6;RSLHSizeLength=2 
    
9.1.4 RTP packet structure 
    
   Two cases can occur; for packets that transport first fragments of 
   Access Units we have:

   Note the compositionTimeStamp is never present since it would be 
   redundant with the RTP time stamp. However the value of CTSFlag is 1 
   to indicate to the receiver that the value of 
   compositionTimeStampFlag for the corresponding reconstructed SL 
   packed. 
    
9.1.5 Overhead estimation 
    
   In this example we have a RTP overhead of 40 + 2 bytes for 1400 
   bytes of payload i.e. 3 % overhead. 
    
    
 
    
9.2 RFC 3016 compatible MPEG-4 Video 
    
   This is an example of a video stream where the SL is configured to 
   produce RTP packets compatible with RFC 3016. 
    
9.2.1 SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useRandomAccessPointFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) usePaddingFlag; = 0

     bit(1) durationFlag; = 0

     bit(32) OCRResolution; = 0 
     bit(8) timeStampLength; = 0 
     bit(8) OCRLength; = 0

     bit(timeStampLength) startCompositionTimeStamp; = 0 
    } 
   } 
    
    
9.2.2 SL Packet Header structure 
    
   With this configuration we have the following SL packet header 
   structure: 
    
   aligned(8) class SL_PacketHeader (SLConfigDescriptor SL) { 
    if (SL.useAccessUnitEndFlag) { 
     bit(1) accessUnitEndFlag; // 1 bit 
    } 
   } 
    
    
9.2.3 SDP mapping information 
    
   This configuration is the default one; no SDP parameters are 
   required. 
    
9.2.4 RTP packet structure 
    
   Note that accessUnitEndFlag is mapped to the RTP header M bit.

   In this example we have a RTP overhead of 40 bytes for 1400 bytes of 
   payload i.e. 3 % overhead. 
 
    
9.3 Low delay MPEG-4 Audio 
    
   This example is for a low delay audio service. For this reason a 
   single SL packet is transported in each RTP packet. 
    
9.3.1 SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   Since CTS=DTS and AU duration is constant signaling of MPEG-4 time 
   stamps is not needed. 
    
   We also assume here an audio Object Type for which all Access Units 
   are Random Access Points, which is signaled using the 
   hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag in the SLConfigDescriptor. 
    
   We assume furtheremore a mode where the Access Unit size is constant 
   and 5 bytes (which is signaled with AU_Length). 
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useRandomAccessPointFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) usePaddingFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useTimeStampsFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useIdleFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) durationFlag; = 0 
     bit(32) timeStampResolution; = 0 
     bit(32) OCRResolution; = 0 
     bit(8) timeStampLength; = 0 
     bit(8) OCRLength; = 0 
     bit(8) AU_Length; = 5 
     bit(8) instantBitrateLength; = 0 
     bit(4) degradationPriorityLength; = 0 
     bit(5) AU_seqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(5) packetSeqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(2) reserved=0b11; 
    } 
    if (durationFlag) { 
     bit(32) timeScale; // NOT USED 
     bit(16) accessUnitDuration; = 20 ms (just an example) 
     bit(16) compositionUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
    }

     bit(timeStampLength) startCompositionTimeStamp; = 0

9.3.2 SL packet header 
    
   With this configuration the SL packet header is empty. 
    
9.3.3 SDP mapping information 
    
   No SDP parameters are required. 
    
9.3.4 RTP packet structure 
    
   Note that the RTP header M bit should be always set to 1.

9.3.5 Overhead estimation 
    
   The overhead is extremely large i.e. more than 800 %, since 40 bytes 
   of headers are required to transport 5 bytes of data. Note however 
   that RTP header compression would work well since time stamps 
   increments are constant. 
    
    
    
    
9.4 Media delivery MPEG-4 Audio 
    
   This example is for a media delivery service where delay is not an 
   issue but efficiency is. In this case several SL Packets are 
   transported in each RTP packet. 
    
9.4.1 SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   Is the same as in 9.3.1. 
    
9.4.2 SL packet header 
    
   With this configuration the SL packet header is empty.

   The absence of RSLHSizeLength in SDP indicates that the RSLHSection 
   is empty. 
    
   The size of SL Packets (which are all complete Access Units in this 
   case) is constant and is indicated in SDP with: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> SLPPSize=5 
    
   This also indicates to the receiver that the Multiple-SL mode will 
   be used, i.e. that a 2 bytes field will give the size of the 
   MSLHSection. In this case however this field always contains zero 
   since the MSLHSection is empty.

9.4.5 Overhead estimation 
    
   The overhead is 3% i.e. minimal. 
    
    
    
9.5 A more complex case: AAC with interleaving 
    
   Let us consider AAC around 130 kb/s where each Access Unit is split 
   in 4 SL packets corresponding to Error Sensitivity Categories (ESC) 
   of maximum 90 bytes for which interleaving is very useful in terms 
   of error resilience. We will therefore use an interleaving scheme 
   where 15 SL Packets from 15 consecutive Access Units will be 
   interleaved per RTP packet to match a MTU of 1500 bytes. 
    
   The interleaving sequence is 4 RTP packets and 350 ms long, which is 
   too long for conferencing but perfectly OK for Internet radio.

   Since the sequence contains 60 SL packets, the sequence number can 
   be encoded on 6 bits. But 2 bits are actually enough if the sender 
   always resets the SL packet sequence number to zero at the start of 
   each sequence, since only the first MSLH in each of the 4 RTP 
   packets in the sequence carries an absolute sequence number value 
   (0,1,2,3). 
    
   2 bits are also enough for SLPSeqNumDelta, which is constant and 
   equal to 3 (since +1 is automatically added)  
    
   Note that the 4th RTP packet in each sequence has its M bit set to 1 
   since it contains 15 SL packets transporting the end of 15 different 
   Access Units. 
    
   With this scheme a sender (for example upon reception of RTCP 
   reports indicating high loss rates) can ûfor example- choose to 
   duplicate for each interleaving sequence the first RTP packet that 
   contains the most useful data in terms of ESC. 
    
   In this example we will also show several other SL features (OCR, AU 
   boundary flags, as detailed below). 
    
   One feature demonstrated by this example is the degradation 
   priority. We assume degradation priority can take 4 different 
   values, one for each SL packet of an Access Unit and is encoded on 2 
   bits. This interleaving scheme makes sure that only SL packets of 
   identical degradation priorities are grouped in the same RTP packet 
   (3.6.3) and that only the first RSLH of each RTP packet transports 
   the degradation priority. 
    
   We also assume that for each last SL packet of each RTP packet the 
   server inserts an OCR. 
    
    
9.5.1 SLConfigDescriptor  
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useRandomAccessPointFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) usePaddingFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useTimeStampsFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useIdleFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) durationFlag; = 0 
     bit(32) timeStampResolution; = 0 
     bit(32) OCRResolution; = 30 
     bit(8) timeStampLength; = 0

     bit(8) OCRLength; = 32 
     bit(8) AU_Length; = 0 
     bit(8) instantBitrateLength; = 0 
     bit(4) degradationPriorityLength; = 2 
     bit(5) AU_seqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(5) packetSeqNumLength; = 6 
     bit(2) reserved=0b11; 
    } 
    if (durationFlag) { 
     bit(32) timeScale; // NOT USED 
     bit(16) accessUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
     bit(16) compositionUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
    } 
    if (!useTimeStampsFlag) { 
     bit(timeStampLength) startDecodingTimeStamp; = 0 
     bit(timeStampLength) startCompositionTimeStamp; = 0 
    } 
   } 
    
9.5.2 SL Packet Header structure 
    
   With this configuration we have the following SL packet header 
   structure: 
    
   aligned(8) class SL_PacketHeader (SLConfigDescriptor SL) { 
    bit(1) accessUnitStartFlag;  
    bit(1) accessUnitEndFlag; 
    bit(1) OCRflag; 
    bit(SL.packetSeqNumLength) packetSequenceNumber; 
    bit(1) DegPrioflag; 
    if (DegPrioflag) { 
     bit(SL.degradationPriorityLength) degradationPriority;} 
    if (OCRflag) { 
     bit(SL.OCRLength) objectClockReference;} 
    } 
   } 
    
9.5.3 SDP mapping information 
    
   The RSLHSize cannot exceed 2 bits, which is encoded on 2 bits and 
   signaled by RSLHSizeLength. 
    
   The resulting concatenated fmtp line is: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> 
   SLPPSizeLength=6;RSLHSizeLength=2;SLPSeqNumLength=2;SLPSeqNumDeltaLe
   ngth=2;OCRDeltaLength=16

9.5.5 Overhead estimation 
    
   The MSLHSection is 19 bytes, the RSLHSection is 10 bytes; in this 
   example we have therefore a RTP overhead of 40 + 23 bytes for 1350 
   bytes (max) of payload i.e. around 5 % overhead.
