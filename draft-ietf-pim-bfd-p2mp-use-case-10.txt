 Fast Failover in Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
 Using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multipoint Networks
                  draft-ietf-pim-bfd-p2mp-use-case-10

Abstract

   This document specifies how Bidirectional Forwarding Detection for
   multipoint networks can provide sub-second failover for routers that
   participate in Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).
   An extension to the PIM Hello message used to bootstrap a point-to-
   multipoint BFD session is also defined in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Faster convergence in the control plane minimizes the periods of
   traffic blackholing, transient routing loops, and other situations
   that may negatively affect service data flow.  Faster convergence in
   the control plane is beneficial to unicast and multicast routing
   protocols.

   [RFC7761] is the current specification of the Protocol Independent
   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  A
   conforming implementation of PIM-SM elects a Designated Router (DR)
   on each PIM-SM interface.  When a group of PIM-SM nodes is connected
   to a shared media segment, e.g., Ethernet, the node elected as DR
   acts on behalf of directly connected hosts in the context of the PIM-
   SM protocol.  Failure of the DR impacts the quality of the multicast
   services it provides to directly connected hosts because the default
   failure detection interval for PIM-SM routers is 105 seconds.

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] was originally
   defined to detect a failure of a point-to-point (p2p) path, single-
   hop [RFC5881] or multihop [RFC5883].  In some PIM-SM deployments, a

Internet-Draft           BFD P2MP Use in PIM-SM            December 2021


   p2p BFD can be used to detect a failure and enable faster failover.
   [RFC8562] extends the BFD base specification [RFC5880] for multipoint
   and multicast networks, which matches the deployment scenarios for
   PIM-SM over a LAN segment.  A BFD system in p2mp environment that
   transmits BFD Control messages using the BFD Demand mode [RFC5880]
   creates less BFD state than the Asynchronous mode.  Point-to-
   multipoint (p2mp) BFD can enable faster detection of PIM-SM router
   failure compared to PIM-SM without BFD and thus minimize multicast
   service disruption.  The monitored PIM-SM router acts as the head and
   other routers as tails of a p2mp BFD session.  This document defines
   the monitoring of a PIM-SM router using p2mp BFD.  This document also
   defines the extension to PIM-SM [RFC7761] to bootstrap a PIM-SM
   router to join in p2mp BFD session over shared media segment.

1.1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC5880], [RFC8562], and
   [RFC7761].  Familiarity with these specifications and the terminology
   used is expected.

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Figure 1 displays the new optional BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option
   to bootstrap a tail of the p2mp BFD session.

   where new fields are interpreted as:

      OptionType: TBA.

      OptionLength: MUST be set to 4.

      HeadDiscriminator: the four-octet field MUST be included in the
      BFD Discriminator PIM-SM Hello option.  The value MUST NOT be
      zero.  It equals the value of My Discriminator ([RFC5880])
      allocated by the head.

   If the value of the OptionLength field is not equal to 4, the BFD
   Discriminator PIM Hello option is considered malformed, and the
   receiver MUST stop processing PIM Hello options.  If the value of the
   HeadDiscriminator field equals zero, then the BFD Discriminator PIM
   Hello option MUST be considered invalid, and the receiver MUST ignore
   it.  The receiver SHOULD log a notification regarding the malformed
   or invalid BFD Discriminator Hello option under the control of a
   throttling logging mechanism.

2.1.  Using P2MP BFD in PIM Router Monitoring

   If the head is no longer serving the function that prompted it to be
   monitored, then it MUST cease including the BFD Discriminator PIM
   Hello option in its PIM-Hello message, and it SHOULD shut down the
   BFD session following the procedures described in Section 5.9
   [RFC8562].

   The head MUST create a BFD session of type MultipointHead [RFC8562].
   Note that any PIM-SM router, regardless of its role, MAY become a
   head of a p2mp BFD session.  To control the volume of BFD control
   traffic on a shared media segment, an operator should carefully
   select PIM-SM routers configured as a head of a p2mp BFD session.
   The head MUST include the BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option in its
   PIM Hello messages.

   A PIM-SM router that is configured to monitor the head by using p2mp
   BFD is referred to throughout this document as a "tail".  When such a
   tail receives a PIM-Hello packet with the BFD Discriminator PIM Hello
   option, the tail MAY create a p2mp BFD session of type
   MultipointTail, as defined in [RFC8562].

Internet-Draft           BFD P2MP Use in PIM-SM            December 2021


   The node that includes the BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option
   transmits BFD Control packets periodically.  For the tail to
   correctly demultiplex BFD [RFC8562], the source address and My
   Discriminator of the BFD packets MUST be the same as the source
   address and the HeadDiscriminator, respectively, of the PIM Hello
   message.  If that is not the case, the tail BFD node would not be
   able to monitor the state of the PIM-SM node, that is, the head of
   the p2mp BFD session, though the regular PIM-SM mechanisms remain
   fully operational.

   If the tail detects a MultipointHead failure [RFC8562], it MUST
   delete the corresponding neighbor state and follow procedures defined
   in [RFC7761] for the DR and additional neighbor state deletion after
   the neighbor timeout expires.

   If the head ceases to include the BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option
   in its PIM-Hello message, tails SHOULD close the corresponding
   MultipointTail BFD session without affecting the PIM state in any
   way.  Thus, the tail stops using BFD to monitor the head and reverts
   to the procedures defined in [RFC7761].

2.2.  P2MP BFD in PIM DR Load Balancing

   [RFC8775] specifies the PIM Designated Router Load Balancing (DRLB)
   functionality.  Any PIM router that advertises the DRLB-Cap Hello
   Option can become the head of a p2mp BFD session, as specified in
   Section 2.1.  The head router administratively sets the
   bfd.SessionState to Up in the MultipointHead session [RFC8562] only
   if it is a Group Designated Router (GDR) Candidate, as specified in
   Sections 5.5 and 5.6 of [RFC8775].  If the router is no longer the
   GDR, then it MUST shut down following the procedures described in
   Section 5.9 [RFC8562].  For each GDR Candidate that includes BFD
   Discriminator option in its PIM Hello, the PIM DR MUST create a
   MultipointTail session [RFC8562].  PIM DR demultiplexes BFD sessions
   based on the value of the My Discriminator field and the source IP
   address.  If PIM DR detects a failure of one of the sessions, it MUST
   remove that router from the GDR Candidate list and immediately
   transmit a new DRLB-List option.

2.3.  Multipoint BFD Encapsulation

   The MultipointHead of a p2mp BFD session when transmitting BFD
   Control packets:

      MUST set TTL or Hop Limit value to 255 (Section 5 [RFC5881]).
      Similarly, all received BFD Control packets that are demultiplexed
      to the session MUST be discarded if the received TTL or Hop Limit
      is not equal to 255;

      MUST use the group address ALL-PIM-ROUTERS ('224.0.0.13' for IPv4
      and 'ff02::d' for IPv6) as destination IP address

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new OptionType value from PIM-Hello
   Options registry according to:

       +=======+========+==========================+===============+
       | Value | Length | Name                     | Reference     |
       +=======+========+==========================+===============+
       | TBA   | 4      | BFD Discriminator Option | This document |
       +-------+--------+--------------------------+---------------+

                   Table 1: BFD Discriminator option type

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a way to accelerate detecting a failure that
   affects PIM functionality by using BFD.  The operation of either
   protocol is not changed.

   The security considerations discussed in [RFC7761], [RFC5880],
   [RFC5881], [RFC8562], and [RFC8775] apply to this document.
