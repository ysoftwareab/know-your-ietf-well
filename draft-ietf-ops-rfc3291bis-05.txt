Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent commonly
   used Internet network layer addressing information. The intent is
   that these textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB
   modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2004


1.  Introduction

   Several standard-track MIB modules use the IpAddress SMIv2 base type.
   This limits the applicability of these MIB modules to IP Version 4
   (IPv4) since the IpAddress SMIv2 base type can only contain 4 byte
   IPv4 addresses. The IpAddress SMIv2 base type has become problematic
   with the introduction of IP Version 6 (IPv6) addresses [RFC3513].

   This document defines multiple textual conventions (TCs) as a
   mechanism to express generic Internet network layer addresses within
   MIB module specifications. The solution is compatible with SMIv2 (STD
   58) and SMIv1 (STD 16). New MIB definitions which need to express
   network layer Internet addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions
   defined in this memo. New MIB modules SHOULD NOT use the SMIv2
   IpAddress base type anymore.

   A generic Internet address consists of two objects, one whose syntax
   is InetAddressType, and another whose syntax is InetAddress. The
   value of the first object determines how the value of the second
   object is encoded. The InetAddress textual convention represents an
   opaque Internet address value. The InetAddressType enumeration is
   used to "cast" the InetAddress value into a concrete textual
   convention for the address type. This usage of multiple textual
   conventions allows expression of the display characteristics of each
   address type and makes the set of defined Internet address types
   extensible.

   The textual conventions for well-known transport domains support
   scoped Internet addresses. The scope of an Internet address is a
   topological span within which the address may be used as a unique
   identifier for an interface or set of interfaces. A scope zone, or
   simply a zone, is a concrete connected region of topology of a given
   scope. Note that a zone is a particular instance of a topological
   region, whereas a scope is the size of a topological region
   [RFCZZZZ].  Since Internet addresses on devices that connect multiple
   zones are not necessarily unique, an additional zone index is needed
   on these devices to select an interface. The textual conventions
   InetAddressIPv4z and InetAddressIPv6z are provided to support
   Internet addresses that include a zone index. In order to support
   arbitrary combinations of scoped Internet addresses, MIB authors
   SHOULD use a separate InetAddressType object for each InetAddress
   object.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can also be used to
   represent generic Internet subnets and Internet address ranges. A
   generic Internet subnet is represented by three objects, one whose
   syntax is InetAddressType, a second one whose syntax is InetAddress
   and a third one whose syntax is InetAddressPrefixLength. The

   InetAddressType value again determines the concrete format of the
   InetAddress value while the InetAddressPrefixLength identifies the
   Internet network address prefix.

   A generic range of consecutive Internet addresses is represented by
   three objects. The first one has the syntax InetAddressType while the
   remaining objects have the syntax InetAddress and specify the start
   and end of the address range. The InetAddressType value again
   determines the format of the InetAddress values.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can be used to
   define Internet addresses by using DNS domain names in addition to
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. A MIB designer can write compliance
   statements to express that only a subset of the possible address
   types must be supported by a compliant implementation.

   MIB developers who need to represent Internet addresses SHOULD use
   these definitions whenever applicable, as opposed to defining their
   own constructs.  Even MIB modules that only need to represent IPv4 or
   IPv6 addresses SHOULD use the InetAddressType/InetAddress textual
   conventions defined in this memo.

   There are many widely deployed MIB modules that use IPv4 addresses
   and which need to be revised to support IPv6. These MIBs can be
   categorized as follows:

   1.  MIB modules which define management information that is in
       principle IP version neutral, but the MIB currently uses
       addressing constructs specific to a certain IP version.
   2.  MIB modules which define management information that is specific
       to particular IP version (either IPv4 or IPv6) and which is very
       unlikely to ever be applicable to another IP version.

   MIB modules of the first type SHOULD provide object definitions
   (e.g., tables) that work with all versions of IP. In particular, when
   revising a MIB module which contains IPv4 specific tables, it is
   suggested to define new tables using the textual conventions defined
   in this memo which support all versions of IP. The status of the new
   tables SHOULD be "current" while the status of the old IP version
   specific tables SHOULD be changed to "deprecated". The other approach
   of having multiple similar tables for different IP versions is
   strongly discouraged.

   MIB modules of the second type, which are inherently IP version
   specific, do not need to be redefined. Note that even in this case,
   any additions to these MIB modules or new IP version specific MIB
   modules SHOULD use the textual conventions defined in this memo.

   MIB developers SHOULD NOT use the textual conventions defined in this
   document to represent generic transport layer addresses. A special
   set of textual conventions for this purpose is defined in RFC 3419
   [RFC3419].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

            ipv6z(4)    A non-global IPv6 address including a zone

            To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
            convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
            It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
            require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
            implementation.

            Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
            and any dependent objects (e.g. InetAddress objects) are
            consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
            if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
            for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In
            particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
            changed together if the address type changes (e.g. from
            ipv6(2) to ipv4(1))."

4.  Usage Hints

   The InetAddressType and InetAddress textual conventions have been
   introduced to avoid over-constraining an object definition by the use
   of the IpAddress SMI base type which is IPv4 specific. An
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pair can represent IP addresses in
   various formats.




Daniele, et al.         Expires December 6, 2004               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2004


   The InetAddressType and InetAddress objects SHOULD NOT be sub-typed
   in object definitions. Sub-typing binds the MIB module to specific
   address formats, which may cause serious problems if new address
   formats need to be introduced. Note that it is possible to write
   compliance statements in order to express that only a subset of the
   defined address types must be implemented to be compliant.

   Every usage of the InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength textual
   conventions must specify which InetAddressType object provides the
   context for the interpretation of the InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention.

   It is suggested that the InetAddressType object is logically
   registered before the object(s) which uses the InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention. An InetAddressType object
   is logically registered before an InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength object if it appears before the InetAddress
   or InetAddressPrefixLength object in the conceptual row (which
   includes any index objects). This rule allows programs such as MIB
   compilers to identify the InetAddressType of a given InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength object by searching for the InetAddressType
   object which precedes an InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength
   object.

4.1  Table Indexing

   When a generic Internet address is used as an index, both the
   InetAddressType and InetAddress objects MUST be used. The
   InetAddressType object MUST be listed before the InetAddress object
   in the INDEX clause.

   The IMPLIED keyword MUST NOT be used for an object of type
   InetAddress in an INDEX clause. Instance sub-identifiers are then of
   the form T.N.O1.O2...On, where T is the value of the InetAddressType
   object, O1...On are the octets in the InetAddress object, and N is
   the number of those octets.

   There is a meaningful lexicographical ordering to tables indexed in
   this fashion. Command generator applications may lookup specific
   addresses of known type and value, issue GetNext requests for
   addresses of a single type, or issue GetNext requests for a specific
   type and address prefix.

4.2  Uniqueness of Addresses

   IPv4 addresses were intended to be globally unique, current usage
   notwithstanding. IPv6 addresses were architected to have different
   scopes and hence uniqueness [RFC3513]. In particular, IPv6



Daniele, et al.         Expires December 6, 2004               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2004


   "link-local" unicast addresses are not guaranteed to be unique on any
   particular node. In such cases, the duplicate addresses must be
   configured on different interfaces. So the combination of an IPv6
   address and a zone index is unique [RFCZZZZ].

   The InetAddressIPv6 textual convention has been defined to represent
   global IPv6 addresses and non-global IPv6 addresses in cases where no
   zone index is needed (e.g., on end hosts with a single interface).
   The InetAddressIPv6z textual convention has been defined to represent
   non-global IPv6 addresses in cases where a zone index is needed
   (e.g., a router connecting multiple zones). MIB designers who use
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs therefore do not need to define
   additional objects in order to support non-global addresses on nodes
   that connect multiple zones.

   The InetAddressIPv4z is intended for use in MIBs (like the TCP-MIB)
   which report addresses in the address family used on the wire, but
   where the entity instrumented obtains such addresses from
   applications or administrators in a form which includes a zone index,
   such as v4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

   The size of the zone index has been chosen so that it is consistent
   with (i) the numerical zone index defined in [RFCZZZZ] and (ii) the
   sin6_scope_id field of the sockaddr_in6 structure defined in RFC 2553
   [RFC2553].

4.3  Multiple Addresses per Host

   A single host system may be configured with multiple addresses (IPv4
   or IPv6), and possibly with multiple DNS names. Thus it is possible
   for a single host system to be accessible by multiple
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs.

   If this could be an implementation or usage issue, the DESCRIPTION
   clause of the relevant objects must fully describe which address is
   reported in a given InetAddressType/InetAddress pair.

4.4  Resolving DNS Names

   DNS names MUST be resolved to IP addresses when communication with
   the named host is required. This raises a temporal aspect to defining
   MIB objects whose value is a DNS name: When is the name translated to
   an address?

   For example, consider an object defined to indicate a forwarding
   destination, and whose value is a DNS name. When does the forwarding
   entity resolve the DNS name? Each time forwarding occurs or just once
   when the object was instantiated?

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2004


   The DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely define how
   and when any required name to address resolution is done.

   Similarly, the DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely
   define how and when a reverse lookup is being done if an agent has
   accessed instrumentation that knows about an IP address and the MIB
   module or implementation requires it to map the IP address to a DNS
   name.

5.  Table Indexing Example

   This example shows a table listing communication peers that are
   identified by either an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or a DNS name.
   The table definition also prohibits entries with an empty address
   (whose type would be "unknown"). The size of a DNS name is limited to
   64 characters in order to satisfy OID length constraints.

   Note that the SMIv2 does not permit inclusion of not-accessible
   objects in an object group (see section 3.1 in STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580]). It is therefore not possible to formally refine the
   syntax of auxiliary objects which are not-accessible.  In such a
   case, it is suggested to express the refinement informally in the
   DESCRIPTION clause of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro invocation.

6.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects. This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

8.  Changes from RFC 3291 to RFC XXXX

   The following changes have been made relative to RFC 3291:
   o  Added a range restriction to the InetAddressPrefixLength textual
      convention.
   o  Added new textual conventions InetZoneIndex, InetScopeType and
      InetVersion.
   o  Added explicit "d" DISPLAY-HINTs for textual conventions that did
      not have them.
   o  Updated boilerplate text and references.

9.  Changes from RFC 2851 to RFC 3291

   The following changes have been made relative to RFC 2851:
   o  Added new textual conventions InetAddressPrefixLength,
      InetPortNumber, and InetAutonomousSystemNumber.
   o  Rewrote the introduction to say clearly that in general, one
      should define MIB tables that work with all versions of IP. The
      other approach of multiple tables for different IP versions is
      strongly discouraged.

   o  Added text to the InetAddressType and InetAddress descriptions
      which requires that implementations must reject set operations
      with an inconsistentValue error if they lead to inconsistencies.
   o  Removed the strict ordering constraints. Description clauses now
      must explain which InetAddressType object provides the context for
      an InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength object.
   o  Aligned wordings with the IPv6 scoping architecture document.
   o  Split the InetAddressIPv6 textual convention into the two textual
      conventions (InetAddressIPv6 and InetAddressIPv6z) and introduced
      a new textual convention InetAddressIPv4z.  Added ipv4z(3) and
      ipv6z(4) named numbers to the InetAddressType enumeration.
      Motivations for this change: (i) enable the introduction of a
      textual conventions for non-global IPv4 addresses, (ii) alignment
      with the textual conventions for transport addresses, (iii)
      simpler compliance statements in cases where support for IPv6
      addresses with zone indices is not required, (iv) simplify
      implementations for host systems which will never have to report
      zone indices.
