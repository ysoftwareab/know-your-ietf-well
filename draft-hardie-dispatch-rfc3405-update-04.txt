1.  Introduction

   Part five of the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS), RFC 3405
   [RFC3405], describes the registration procedures for assignments in
   URI.ARPA.  The document requires that registrations be in the "IETF
   tree" of URI registrations.  The use of URI scheme name trees was
   defined in RFC 2717 [RFC2717] but discontinued by RFC 4395 [RFC4395]
   and its successors.  Since the use of trees was discontinued, there
   is no way in the current process set out in BCP 35 [RFC7595] to meet
   the requirement to register within that tree.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updated Requirements

   This document removes the normative requirement from RFC 3405 for
   registrations in URI.ARPA to be from the IETF URI Tree.

   All registrations in URI.ARPA MUST now be for schemes which are
   permanent registrations, as they are described in BCP 35.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This entire document is updated instructions to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This update does not change the Security Considerations in RFC 3405
