Abstract

   RSVP signaling can be used to make end-to-end resource reservations
   in an IP network in order to guarantee the Quality of Service
   required by certain flows.  With conventional RSVP, both the data

   sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.
   Yet, there are many use cases where resource reservation is required,
   but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  This
   document presents RSVP Proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to
   perform RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is
   not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations to be
   established on critical parts of the end-to-end path.  This document
   reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP Proxies and
   discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application
   requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating
   in RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or
   to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP
   Proxy approach.  However, such extensions are outside the scope of
   this document.  Finally, practical use cases for RSVP Proxy are
   described.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


1.  Introduction

   Guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) for some applications with tight
   requirements (such as voice or video) may be achieved by reserving
   resources in each node on the end-to-end path.  The main IETF
   protocol for these resource reservations is RSVP, specified in
   [RFC2205].  RSVP does not require that all intermediate nodes support
   RSVP, however it assumes that both the sender and the receiver of the
   data flow support RSVP.  There are environments where it would be
   useful to be able to reserve resources for a flow on at least a
   subset of the flow path even when the sender or the receiver (or
   both) is not RSVP capable.

   Since the data sender or receiver may be unaware of RSVP, there are
   two scenarios.  In the first case, an entity in the network must
   operate on behalf of the data sender, and in particular, generate
   RSVP Path messages, and eventually receive, process and sink Resv
   messages.  We refer to this entity as the RSVP Sender Proxy.  In the
   latter case, an entity in the network must receive Path messages sent
   by a data sender (or by an RSVP Sender Proxy), sink those, and return
   Resv messages on behalf of the data receiver(s).  We refer to this
   entity as the RSVP Receiver Proxy.

   The flow sender and receiver generally have at least some (if not
   full) awareness of the application producing or consuming that flow.
   Hence, the sender and receiver are in a natural position to
   synchronize the establishment, maintenance and tear down of the RSVP
   reservation with the application requirements.  Similarly they are in
   a natural position to determine the characteristics of the
   reservation (bandwidth, QoS service,...) which best match the
   application requirements.  For example, before completing the
   establishment of a multimedia session, the endpoints may decide to
   establish RSVP reservations for the corresponding flows.  Similarly,
   when the multimedia session is torn down, the endpoints may decide to
   tear down the corresponding RSVP reservations.  For instance,
   [RFC3312] discusses how RSVP reservations can be very tightly
   synchronized by SIP endpoints with SIP session control and SIP
   signaling.

   When RSVP reservation establishment, maintenance and tearing down is
   to be handled by RSVP Proxies on behalf of an RSVP sender or
   receiver, a key challenge for the RSVP Proxy is to determine when the
   RSVP reservations need to be established, maintained and torn down
   and to determine what are the characteristics (bandwidth, QoS
   Service,...) of the required RSVP reservations matching the
   application requirements.  We refer to this problem as the
   synchronization of RSVP reservations with application level
   requirements.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   The IETF Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group is designing,
   as one their charter items, a new QoS signaling protocol.  This
   scheme already includes the notion of proxy operation, and
   terminating QoS signaling on nodes that are not the actual data
   senders or receivers.  This is the same concept as the proxy
   operation for RSVP discussed in this document.  One difference though
   is that the NSIS framework does not consider multicast resource
   reservations, which RSVP provides today.

   The next section introduces the notion of RSVP Sender Proxy and RSVP
   Receiver Proxy.  The following section defines useful terminology.
   The subsequent section then presents several fundamental RSVP Proxy
   approaches insisting on how they achieve the necessary
   synchronization of RSVP reservations with application level
   requirements.  Appendix A includes more detailed use cases for the
   proxies in various real life deployment environments.


2.  RSVP Proxy Behaviors

   This section discusses the two types of proxies; the RSVP Sender
   Proxy operating on behalf of data senders, and the RSVP Receiver
   Proxy operating for data receivers.  The concepts presented in this
   document are not meant to replace the standard RSVP and end-to-end
   RSVP reservations are still expected to be used whenever possible.
   However, RSVP Proxies are intended to facilitate RSVP deployment
   where end-to-end RSVP signaling is not possible.

2.1.  RSVP Receiver Proxy

   With conventional RSVP operations, RSVP reservations are controlled
   by receivers of data.  After a data sender has sent an RSVP Path
   message towards the intended recipient(s), each recipient that
   requires a reservation generates a Resv message.  If, however, a data
   receiver is not running the RSVP protocol, the last hop RSVP router
   will still send the Path message to the data receiver, which will
   silently drop this message as an IP packet with an unknown protocol
   number.

   In order for reservations to be made in such a scenario, one of the
   RSVP routers on the data path must somehow know that the data
   receiver will not be participating in the resource reservation
   signaling.  This RSVP router should, thus, perform RSVP Receiver
   Proxy functionality on behalf of the data receiver.  This is
   illustrated in Figure 1.  Various mechanisms by which the RSVP proxy
   router can gain the required information are discussed later in the
   document.

2.2.  RSVP Sender Proxy

   With conventional RSVP operations, if a data sender is not running
   the RSVP protocol, a resource reservation can not be set up; a data
   receiver can not alone reserve resources without Path messages first
   being received.  Thus, even if the data receiver is running RSVP, it
   still needs some node on the data path to send a Path message towards
   the data receiver.

   In that case, an RSVP node on the data path must somehow know that it
   should generate Path messages to allow the receiver to set up the
   resource reservation.  This node is referred to as the RSVP Sender
   Proxy and is illustrated in Figure 2.  This case is more complex than
   the Receiver Proxy case, since the RSVP Sender Proxy must be able to
   generate all the information in the Path message (such as the Sender
   TSpec) without the benefit of having previously received any RSVP
   message.  An RSVP Receiver Proxy, by contrast only needs to formulate
   an appropriate Resv message in response to an incoming Path message.
   Mechanisms to operate an RSVP Sender Proxy are discussed later in
   this document.

3.  Terminology

   On-Path: located on the datapath of the actual flow of application
   data (regardless of where it is located with respect to the
   application level signaling path).

   Off-Path: not On-Path.

   RSVP-capable (or RSVP-aware): which supports the RSVP protocol as per
   [RFC2205].

   RSVP Receiver Proxy: an RSVP capable router performing, on behalf of
   a receiver, the RSVP operations which would normally be performed by
   an RSVP-capable receiver if end-to-end RSVP signaling was used.  Note
   that while RSVP is used upstream of the RSVP Receiver Proxy, RSVP is
   not used downstream of the RSVP Receiver Proxy.

   RSVP Sender Proxy: an RSVP capable router performing, on behalf of a
   sender, the RSVP operations which would normally be performed by an
   RSVP-capable sender if end-to-end RSVP signaling was used.  Note that
   while RSVP is used downstream of the RSVP Sender Proxy, RSVP is not
   used upstream of the RSVP Sender Proxy.

   Regular RSVP Router: an RSVP-capable router which is not behaving as
   a RSVP Receiver Proxy nor as a RSVP Sender Proxy.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   Note that the roles of RSVP Receiver Proxy, RSVP Sender Proxy,
   Regular RSVP Router are all relative to one unidirectional flow.  A
   given router may act as the RSVP Receiver Proxy for a flow, as the
   RSVP Sender Proxy for another flow and as a Regular RSVP router for
   yet another flow.

   Application level signaling: signaling between entities operating
   above the IP layer and which are aware of the QoS requirements for
   actual media flows.  SIP and RTSP are examples of application level
   signaling protocol.  RSVP is clearly not an application level
   signaling.


4.  RSVP Proxy Approaches

   This section discusses several fundamental RSVP Proxy approaches.

4.1.  Path-Triggered Receiver Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that the sender is RSVP capable and
   takes full care of the synchronization between application
   requirements and RSVP reservations.  With this approach, the RSVP
   Receiver Proxy uses the RSVP Path messages generated by the sender as
   the cue for establishing the RSVP reservation on behalf of the
   receiver.  The RSVP Receiver Proxy is effectively acting as a slave
   making reservations (on behalf of the receiver) under the sender's
   control.  This changes somewhat the usual RSVP reservation model
   where reservations are normally controlled by receivers.  Such a
   change greatly facilitates operations in the scenario of interest
   here, which is where the receiver is not RSVP capable.  Indeed it
   allows the RSVP Receiver Proxy to remain application unaware by
   taking advantage of the application awareness and RSVP awareness of
   the sender.

   With the Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy approach, the RSVP router
   may be configured to use receipt of a regular RSVP Path message as
   the trigger for RSVP Receiver Proxy behavior.

   On receipt of the RSVP Path message, the RSVP Receiver Proxy:

   1.  establishes the RSVP Path state as per regular RSVP processing

   2.  identifies the downstream interface towards the receiver

   3.  sinks the Path message

   4.  behaves as if a Resv message (whose details are discussed below)
       was received on the downstream interface.  This includes

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


       performing admission control on the downstream interface,
       establishing a Resv state (in case of successful admission
       control) and forwarding the Resv message upstream, sending
       periodic refreshes of the Resv message and tearing down the
       reservation if the Path state is torn down.

   In order to build the Resv message, the RSVP Receiver Proxy can take
   into account information received in the Path message.  For example,
   the RSVP Receiver Proxy may compose a FLOWSPEC object for the Resv
   message which mirrors the SENDER_TSPEC object in the received Path
   message.

   Operation of the Path-Triggered Receiver Proxy in the case of a
   successful reservation is illustrated in Figure 3.

   In case the reservation establishment is rejected (for example
   because of an admission control failure on a regular RSVP router on
   the path between the RSVP-capable sender and the RSVP Receiver
   Proxy), a ResvErr message will be generated as per conventional RSVP
   operations and will travel downstream towards the RSVP Receiver
   Proxy.  While this ensures that the RSVP Receiver Proxy is aware of
   the reservation failure, conventional RSVP procedures do not cater
   for notification of the sender of the reservation failure.  Operation

         Figure 4: Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy with Failure

   Since, as explained above, in this scenario involving the RSVP
   Receiver Proxy, synchronization between application and RSVP
   reservation is generally performed by the sender, notifying the
   sender of reservation failure is needed.
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto] specifies RSVP extensions allowing
   such sender notification in case of reservation failure in the
   presence of a Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy.

4.2.  Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction

   In this approach, it is assumed that one endpoint is RSVP capable and
   takes full care of the synchronization between application
   requirements and RSVP reservations.  This endpoint is the sender for
   one flow direction (which we refer to as the "forward" direction) and
   is the receiver for the flow in the opposite direction (which we
   refer to as the "reverse" direction).

   With the Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction approach,

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   the RSVP Proxy uses the RSVP signaling generated by the sender as the
   cue for initiating RSVP signaling for the reservation in the reverse
   direction.  Thus, the RSVP Proxy is effectively acting as a Sender
   Proxy for the reverse direction under the control of the sender for
   the forward direction.  Note that this assumes a degree of symmetry
   for the two directions of the flow (as is currently typical for IP
   telephony, for example).  This is illustrated in Figure 5.

   Of course, the RSVP Proxy may simultaneously (and typically will)
   also act as the Path-Triggered Receiver Proxy for the forward
   direction, as defined in Section 4.1.  Such an approach is most
   useful in situations involving RSVP reservations in both directions
   for symmetric flows.  This is illustrated in Figure 6.

             Figure 6: Path Triggered Receiver & Sender Proxy

   With the Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction approach,
   the RSVP router may be configurable to use receipt of a regular RSVP
   Path message as the trigger for Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction
   behavior.

   On receipt of the RSVP Path message for the forward direction, the
   RSVP Sender Receiver Proxy :

   1.  sinks the Path message

   2.  behaves as if a Path message for reverse direction (whose details
       are discussed below) had been received by the Sender Proxy.  This
       includes establishing the corresponding Path state, forwarding
       the Path message downstream, sending periodic refreshes of the

       Path message and tearing down the Path in reverse direction when
       the Path state in forward direction is torn down.

   In order to build the Path message for the reverse direction, the
   RSVP Sender Proxy can take into account information in the received
   Path message for the forward direction.  For example, the RSVP Sender
   Proxy may mirror the SENDER_TSPEC object in the received Path
   message.

   We observe that this approach does not require any extensions to the
   existing RSVP protocol.

4.3.  Inspection-Triggered Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that the RSVP Proxy is on the
   datapath of "packets of interest", that it can inspect such packets
   on the fly as they transit through it, and that it can infer
   information from these packets of interest to determine what RSVP
   reservations need to be established, when and with what
   characteristics (possibly also using some configured information).

   One example of "packets of interest" could be application level
   signaling.  An RSVP Proxy capable of inspecting SIP signaling for
   multimedia session or RTSP signaling for Video streaming, can obtain
   from such signaling information about when a multimedia session is up
   or when a Video is going to be streamed.  It can also identify the
   addresses and ports of senders and receivers and can determine the
   bandwidth of the corresponding flows.  Thus, such an RSVP Proxy can
   determine all necessary information to synchronize RSVP reservations
   to application requirements.  This is illustrated in Figure 7.

                 Figure 7: Inspection-Triggered RSVP Proxy

   Another example of "packets of interest" could be packets belonging
   to the application flow itself (e.g. media packets).  An RSVP Proxy
   capable of detecting the transit of packets from a particular flow,
   can attempt to establish a reservation corresponding to that flow.
   Characteristics of the reservation may be derived from configuration,
   flow measurement or a combination of those.

   Note however, that in case of reservation failure, the inspection-
   triggered RSVP Proxy does not have a direct mechanism for notifying
   the application (since it is not participating itself actively in
   application signaling) so that the application takes appropriate
   action (for example terminate the corresponding session).  To
   mitigate this problem, the inspection-triggered RSVP Proxy may mark
   differently the DSCP of flows for which an RSVP reservation has been
   successfully proxied from the flows for which a reservation is not in

   place.  In some situations, the Inspection-Triggered Proxy might be
   able to modify the "packets of interest" (e.g. application signaling
   messages) to convey some hint to applications that the corresponding
   flows cannot be guaranteed by RSVP reservations.

   With the inspection-triggered Proxy approach, the RSVP Receiver Proxy
   is effectively required to attempt to build application awareness by
   traffic inspection and then is somewhat limited in the actions in can
   take in case of reservation failure.  However, this may be a useful
   approach in some environments.  Note also that this approach does not
   require any change to the RSVP protocol.

   With the "Inspection-Triggered" RSVP Proxy approach, the RSVP router
   may be configurable to use and interpret some specific "packets of
   interest" as the trigger for RSVP Receiver Proxy behavior.

4.4.  STUN-Triggered Proxy

   In this approach, the RSVP Proxy takes advantage of the application
   awareness provided by the STUN signaling to synchronize RSVP
   reservations with application requirements.  The STUN signaling is
   sent from endpoint to endpoint.  This is illustrated in Figure 8.

 ==>  segment of flow path protected by RSVP reservation

 ***> RTP media flow


                      Figure 8: STUN-Triggered Proxy

   In this approach, a STUN [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] message
   triggers the RSVP proxy.  Using a STUN message eases the RSVP proxy
   agent's computational burden because it need only look for STUN
   messages rather than maintain state of all flows.  More importantly,
   the STUN message can also include a STUN attribute describing the
   bandwidth and describing the application requesting the flow, which
   allows the RSVP proxy agent to authorize an appropriately-sized
   reservation for each flow.

   For unicast flows, [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] is an already widely-adopted
   emerging standard for NAT traversal.  For our purposes, we are not
   interested in its NAT traversal capabilities.  Rather, ICE's useful
   characteristic is its connectivity check -- the exchange of STUN
   Binding Request messages between hosts to verify connectivity (see
   Connectivity Check Usage in [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis]).  By
   including new STUN attributes in those messages an RSVP proxy agent
   could perform its functions more effectively.  Additionally, the RSVP
   proxy agent can inform endpoints of an RSVP reservation failure by
   dropping the ICE connectivity check message.  This provides very
   RSVP-like call admission control and signaling to the endpoints,
   without implementing RSVP on the endpoints.

   For multicast flows (or certain kinds of unicast flows that don't or



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 16]

   can't use ICE), a STUN Indication message
   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] could be used for similar purposes.  The
   STUN Indication message is not acknowledged by its receiver and has
   the same scalability as the underlying multicast flow itself.

   The corresponding extensions to ICE and STUN for such a STUN-
   triggered RSVP Proxy approach are beyond the scope of this document.
   They may be defined in the future in a separate document.

4.5.  Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that an entity involved in the
   application level signaling controls an RSVP Proxy which is located
   in the datapath of the application flows (i.e. "on-path").  With this
   approach, the RSVP Proxy does not attempt to determine itself the
   application reservation requirements.  Instead the RSVP Proxy is
   instructed by the entity participating in application level signaling
   to establish, maintain and tear down reservations as needed by the
   application flows.  In other words, with this approach, the solution
   for synchronizing RSVP signaling with application level requirements
   is to rely on an application-level signaling entity that controls an
   RSVP Proxy function that sits in the flow datapath.  This approach
   allows control of an RSVP Sender Proxy, an RSVP Receiver Proxy or
   both.

   Operation of the Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy is illustrated
   in Figure 9.

 //   RSVP Proxy control interface


               Figure 9: Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy

   As an example, the Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy may be used in
   the context of Session Border Controllers (SBCs) (see
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-sbc-funcs] for description of SBCs) to establish
   RSVP reservations for multimedia sessions.  In that case, the
   Application Entity may be the signaling component of the SBC.

   This RSVP Proxy approach does not require any extension to the RSVP
   protocol.  However, it relies on an RSVP Proxy control interface
   allowing control of the RSVP Proxy by an application signaling
   entity.  This RSVP Proxy control interface is beyond the scope of the
   present document.  Candidate protocols for realizing such interface
   include SNMP, COPS-PR, QPIM, XML and DIAMETER.  This interface may

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   rely on soft states or hard states.  Clearly, when hard states are
   used, those need to be converted appropriately by the RSVP Proxy
   entities into the corresponding RSVP soft states.

   In general, the Application Entity is not expected to maintain
   awareness of which RSVP Receiver Proxy is on the path to which
   destination.  However, in the particular cases where it does so
   reliably, we observe that the Application Entity could control the
   RSVP Sender Proxy and Receiver Proxy so that aggregate RSVP
   reservations are used between those, instead of one reservation per
   flow.  For example, these aggregate reservations could be of RSVP-
   AGGREGATE type as specified in [RFC3175] or of GENERIC-AGGREGATE type
   as specified in [RFC4860].  Such aggregate reservations could be used
   so that a single reservation can be used for multiple (possibly all)
   application flows transiting via the same RSVP Sender Proxy and the
   same RSVP Receiver Proxy.

   For situations where only the RSVP Sender Proxy has to be controlled
   by this interface, the interface may be realized through the simple
   use of RSVP itself, over a GRE tunnel from the application entity to
   the RSVP Sender Proxy.  This particular case is further discussed in
   Section 4.5.1.  Another particular case of interest is where the
   application signaling entity resides on the same device as the RSVP
   Proxy.  In that case, this interface may be trivially realized as an
   internal API.  An example environment based on this particular case
   is illustrated in Section 4.5.2.

4.5.1.  Application_Entity-Controlled Sender Proxy using "RSVP over GRE"

   This approach is simply a particular case of the more general
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy, but where only RSVP Sender
   Proxies need to be controlled by the application, and where RSVP is
   effectively used as the control protocol between the application
   signaling entity and the RSVP Sender Proxy.

   In this approach, the RSVP messages (e.g.  RSVP Path message) are
   effectively generated by the application entity and logically
   "tunnelled" to the RSVP Sender Proxy via GRE tunneling.  This is to
   ensure that the RSVP messages follow the exact same path as the flow
   they protect (as required by RSVP operations) on the segment of the
   end-to-end path which is to be subject to RSVP reservations.

   Figure 10 illustrates such an environment.

   o  generates a Path message on behalf of the sender, corresponding to
      the reservation needed by the application and maintains the
      corresponding Path state.  The Path message built by the
      application entity is exactly the same as would be built by the

      which is that the Application Entity puts its own IP address as
      the RSVP Previous Hop. In particular, it is recommended that the

      source address of the Path message built by the application entity
      be set to the IP address of the sender (not of the application
      entity).  This helps ensuring that, in the presence of non-RSVP
      routers and of load-balancing in the network where the load-
      balancing algorithm takes into account the source IP address, the
      Path message generated by the application entity follows the exact
      same path that the actual stream sourced by the sender.

   o  encapsulates the Path message into a GRE tunnel whose destination
      address is the RSVP Sender Proxy i.e. an RSVP Router sitting on
      the datapath for the flow (and upstream of the segment which
      requires QoS guarantees via RSVP reservation).

   o  processes the corresponding received RSVP messages (including Resv
      messages) as per regular RSVP.

   o  synchronizes the RSVP reservation state with application level
      requirements and signaling.

   Note that since the application entity encodes its own IP address as
   the RSVP PHOP in the Path message, the RSVP Router terminating the
   GRE tunnel naturally addresses all the RSVP messages travelling
   upstream hop-by-hop (such as Resv messages) to the application entity
   (without having to encapsulate those in a reverse-direction GRE
   tunnel towards the application entity).

4.5.2.  Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy via Co-Location

   This approach is simply a particular case of the more general
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy, but where the application entity
   is co-located with the RSVP Proxy.  As an example, Session Border
   Controllers (SBC) with on-board SIP agents could implement RSVP Proxy
   functions and make use of such an approach to achieve session
   admission control over the SBC-to-SBC segment using RSVP signaling.

   Figure 11 illustrates operations of the Application_Entity-Controlled
   RSVP Proxy via Co-location.

   This RSVP Proxy approach does not require any protocol extensions.
   We also observe that when multiple sessions are to be established on
   paths sharing the same RSVP Sender Proxy and the same RSVP Receiver
   Proxy, the RSVP Proxies have the option to establish aggregate RSVP
   reservations (as defined in ([RFC3175] or [RFC4860]) for a group of
   sessions, instead of establishing one RSVP reservation per session.

4.6.  Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that a Policy Server, which is
   located in the control plane of the network, controls an RSVP Proxy
   which is located in the datapath of the application flows (i.e. "on-
   path").  In turn, the Policy server is triggered by an entity
   involved in the application level signaling.  With this approach, the
   RSVP Proxy does not attempt to determine itself the application
   reservation requirements, but instead is instructed by the Policy
   Server to establish, maintain and tear down reservations as needed by
   the application flows.  Moreover, the entity participating in
   application level signaling does not attempt to understand the
   specific reservation mechanism (i.e.  RSVP) or the topology of the
   network layer, but instead it simply asks the policy server to

   perform (or teardown) a reservation.  In other words, with this
   approach, the solution for synchronizing RSVP signaling with
   application level requirements is to rely on an application level
   entity that controls a policy server that, in turn, controls an RSVP
   Proxy function that sits in the flow datapath.  This approach allows
   control of an RSVP Sender Proxy, an RSVP Receiver Proxy or both.

   Operation of the Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy is illustrated

 //   RSVP Proxy control interface

 I    Interface between Application Entity and Policy Server

                 Figure 12: Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy

   This RSVP Proxy approach does not require any extension to the RSVP
   protocol.  However, as with the Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy
   approach presented in Figure 9, this approach relies on an RSVP Proxy
   control interface allowing control of the RSVP Proxy (by the Policy
   Server in this case).  This RSVP Proxy control interface is beyond
   the scope of the present document.  Considerations about candidate
   protocols for realizing such interface can be found in Section 4.5.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   Again, for situations where only the RSVP Sender Proxy has to be
   controlled by this interface, the interface may be realized through
   the simple use of RSVP Itself, over a GRE tunnel from the Policy
   Server to the RSVP Sender Proxy.  This is similar to what is
   presented in Section 4.5.1 except that the "RSVP over GRE" interface
   is used in this case by the Policy Server (instead of the application
   entity).

   The interface between the Application Entity and the Policy Server is
   beyond the scope of this document.

4.7.  RSVP-Signaling-Triggered Proxy

   An RSVP Proxy can also be triggered and controlled through extended
   RSVP signaling from the remote end that is RSVP-capable (and supports
   these RSVP extensions for Proxy control).  For example, an RSVP
   capable sender could send a new or extended RSVP message explicitly
   requesting an RSVP Proxy on the path towards the receiver to behave
   as an RSVP Receiver Proxy and also to trigger a reverse direction
   reservation thus also behaving as a RSVP Sender Proxy.  The new or
   extended RSVP message sent by the sender could also include
   attributes (e.g. bandwidth) for the reservations to be signaled by
   the RSVP Proxy.

   The challenges in these explicit signaling schemes include:

   o  How can the nodes determine when a reservation request ought to be
      proxied and when it should not, and accordingly invoke appropriate
      signaling procedures?

   o  How does the node sending the messages explicitly triggering the
      Proxy know where the Proxy is located, e.g., determine an IP
      address of the proxy that should reply to the signaling?

   o  How is all the information needed by a Sender Proxy to generate a
      Path message actually communicated to the Proxy?

   An example of such a mechanism is presented in
   [I-D.manner-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-sig].  This scheme is primarily targeted
   to local access network reservations whereby an end host can request
   resource reservations for both incoming and outgoing flows only over
   the access network.  This may be useful in environments where the
   access network is typically the bottleneck while the core is
   comparatively over-provisioned, as may be the case with a number of
   radio access technologies.  In this proposal, messages targeted to
   the Proxy are flagged with one bit in all RSVP messages.  Similarly,
   all RSVP messages sent back by the Proxy are also flagged.  The use
   of such a flag allows differentiating between proxied and end-to-end

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   reservations.  For triggering an RSVP Receiver Proxy, the sender of
   the data sends a Path message which is marked with the mentioned
   flag.  The Receiver Proxy is located on the signaling and data path,
   eventually gets the Path message, and replies back with a Resv
   message.  A node triggers an RSVP Sender Proxy with a newly defined
   Path_Request message, which instructs the proxy to send Path messages
   towards the triggering node.  The node then replies back with a Resv.
   More details can be found in [I-D.manner-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-sig].

   Such an RSVP-Signaling-Triggered Proxy approach would require RSVP
   signaling extensions (that are outside the scope of the present
   document).  However it could provide more flexibility in the control
   of the Proxy behavior (e.g. control of reverse reservation
   parameters) than provided by the Path-Triggered approaches defined in
   Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.

4.8.  Endsystem-Controlled Proxy

   In some cases, having a full RSVP implementation running on an end
   host can be seen to produce excessive overhead.  In end-hosts that
   are low in processing power and functionality, having an RSVP daemon
   run and take care of the signaling may introduce unnecessary
   overhead.  One article [Kars01] proposes to create a remote API so
   that the daemon would in fact run on the end-host's default router
   and the end-host application would send its requests to that daemon.
   Thus, we can have deployments, where an end host uses some
   lightweight protocol to communicate with its pre-defined RSVP router
   - a form of RSVP proxy.  Such a lightweight protocol is outside the
   scope of the present document.


5.  Security Considerations

   In the environments of concern for this document, RSVP messages are
   used to control resource reservations on a segment of the end-to-end
   path of flows.  To ensure the integrity of the associated reservation
   and admission control mechanisms, the cryptographic authentication
   mechanisms defined in [RFC2747]] and [RFC3097] can be used.  Those
   protect RSVP messages integrity hop-by-hop and provide node
   authentication, thereby protecting against corruption, spoofing of
   RSVP messages and replay.
   [I-D.behringer-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] discusses key types,
   key provisioning methods as well as their respective applicability.

   A number of additional security considerations apply to the use of
   RSVP proxies and are discussed below.

   With some RSVP Proxy approaches, the RSVP proxy operates autonomously



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   inside an RSVP router.  This is the case for the Path-Triggered Proxy
   approaches defined in Section 4.1 and in Section 4.2, for the
   Inspection-Triggered Proxy approach defined in Section 4.3, for the
   STUN-Triggered Proxy approach defined in Section 4.4 and for the
   RSVP-Signaling-Triggered approach defined in Section 4.7.  Proper
   reservation operation assumes that the RSVP proxy can be trusted to
   behave correctly in order to control the RSVP reservation as required
   and expected by the end systems.  Since, the basic RSVP operation
   already assumes a trust model where end-systems trust RSVP nodes to
   appropriately perform RSVP reservations, the use of RSVP proxy that
   behave autonomously within an RSVP router is not seen as introducing
   any significant additional security threat or as fundamentally
   modifying the RSVP trust model.

   With some RSVP Proxy approaches, the RSVP proxy operate under the
   control of another entity.  This is the case for the
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy approach defined in Section 4.5
   and for the Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy approach defined in
   Section 4.6.  This introduces additional security risks since the
   entity controlling the RSVP Proxy needs to be trusted for proper
   reservation operation.  The exact mechanisms to establish such trust
   are beyond the scope of this document, but they may include security
   mechanisms inside the protocol used as the control interface between
   the RSVP Proxy and the entity controlling it, as well as security
   mechanisms for all the interfaces involved in the reservation control
   chain (e.g. inside the application signaling protocol between the end
   systems and the application entity, and, in the case of the
   Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy approach, in the protocol between the
   application entity and the policy server).

   In some situations, the use of RSVP Proxy to control reservations on
   behalf of end-systems may actually reduce the security risk (at least
   from the network operator viewpoint).  This could be the case, for
   example, because the routers where the RSVP Proxy functionality runs
   are less exposed to tampering than end-systems.  Such a case is
   further discussed in section 4 of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto].

Appendix A.  Use Cases for RSVP Proxies

A.1.  RSVP-based VoD CAC in Broadband Aggregation Networks

   As broadband services for residential are becoming more and more
   prevalent, next generation aggregation networks are being deployed in
   order to aggregate traffic from broadband users (whether attached via

   Digital Subscriber Line technology aka DSL, Fiber To The Home/Curb
   aka FTTx, Cable or other broadband access technology).  Video on
   Demand (VoD) services which may be offered to broadband users present
   significant capacity planning challenges for the aggregation network
   for a number of reasons.  First each VoD stream requires significant
   dedicated sustained bandwidth (typically 2-4 Mb/s in Standard
   Definition TV and 6-12 Mb/s in High Definition TV).  Secondly, the
   VoD codec algorithms are very sensitive to packet loss.  Finally, the
   load resulting from such services is very hard to predict (e.g. it
   can vary very suddenly with block-buster titles made available as
   well as with promotional offerings).  As a result, transport of VoD
   streams on the aggregation network usually translate into a strong
   requirement for admission control.  The admission control solution
   protects the quality of established VoD sessions by rejecting the
   additional excessive session attempts during unpredictable peaks,
   during link or node failures, or combination of those factors.

   RSVP can be used in the aggregation network for admission control of
   the VoD sessions.  However, since Customer Premises equipment such as
   Set Top Boxes (which behave as the receiver for VoD streams) often do
   not support RSVP, the last IP hop in the aggregation network can
   behave as an RSVP Receiver Proxy.  This way, RSVP can be used between
   VoD Pumps and the last IP hop in the Aggregation network to perform
   accurate admission control of VoD streams over the resources set
   aside for VoD in the aggregation network (typically a certain
   percentage of the bandwidth of any link).  As VoD streams are
   unidirectional, a simple "Path-Triggered" RSVP Receiver Proxy (as
   described in Section 4.1) is all that is required in this use case.

   The Figure below illustrates operation of RSVP-based admission
   control of VoD sessions in an Aggregation network involving RSVP
   support on the VoD Pump (the senders) and RSVP Receiver Proxy on the
   last IP hop of the aggregation network.  All the customer premises
   equipment remain RSVP unaware.

   In the case where the VoD Pumps are not RSVP-capable, an
   Application_Entity-Controlled Sender Proxy via "RSVP over GRE"
   approach (as described in Section 4.5.1) can also be implemented on
   the VoD Controller or Session Resource Manager (SRM) devices
   typically involved in VoD deployments.  Figure 14 illustrates
   operation of RSVP-based admission control of VoD sessions in an
   Aggregation network involving such Application_Entity-Controlled
   Source Proxy combined with an RSVP Receiver Proxy on the last IP hop
   of the aggregation network.  All the customer premises equipment, as
   well as the VoD pumps, remain RSVP unaware.

   The RSVP Proxy entities specified in this document play a significant
   role here since they allow immediate deployment of an RSVP-based
   admission control solution for VoD without requiring any upgrade to
   the huge installed base of non-RSVP-capable customer premises
   equipment.  In one mode described above, they also avoid upgrade of
   non-RSVP-capable VoD pumps.  In turn, this means that the benefits of

   on-path admission control can be offered to VoD services over
   broadband aggregation networks without network or VoD Pump upgrade.
   Those include accurate bandwidth accounting regardless of topology
   (hub-and-spoke, ring, mesh, star, arbitrary combinations) and dynamic
   adjustment to any change in topology (such as failure, routing
   change, additional links...).

A.2.  RSVP-based Voice/Video CAC in Enterprise WAN

   More and more enterprises are migrating their telephony and
   videoconferencing applications onto IP.  When doing so, there is a
   need for retaining admission control capabilities of existing TDM-
   based systems to ensure the QoS of these applications is maintained
   even when transiting through the enterprise's Wide Area Network
   (WAN).  Since many of the endpoints already deployed (such as IP
   Phones or Videoconferencing terminals) are not RSVP capable, RSVP
   Proxy approaches are very useful: they allow deployment of an RSVP-
   based admission control solution over the WAN without requiring
   upgrade of the existing terminals.

   A common deployment architecture for such environments relies on the
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy approach as defined in
   Section 4.5.  Routers sitting at the edges of the WAN network and
   naturally "on-path" for all inter-campus calls (or sessions) and
   behave as RSVP Proxies.  The RSVP Proxies establish, maintain and
   tear-down RSVP reservations over the WAN segment for the calls (or
   sessions) under the control of the SIP Server/Proxy.  The SIP Server/
   Proxy synchronizes the RSVP reservation status with the status of
   end-to-end calls.  For example, the called IP phone will only be
   instructed to play a ring tone if the RSVP reservations over the
   corresponding WAN segment has been successfully established.

   This architecture allowing RSVP-based admission control of voice and
   video on the Enterprise WAN is illustrated in Figure 15.

A.4.  RSVP Proxies for Mobile Access Networks

   Mobile access networks are increasingly based on IP technology.  This
   implies that, on the network layer, all traffic, both traditional
   data and streamed data like audio or video, is transmitted as
   packets.  Increasingly popular multimedia applications would benefit



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches                July 2007


   from better than best-effort service from the network, a forwarding
   service with strict Quality of Service (QoS) with guaranteed minimum
   bandwidth and bounded delay.  Other applications, such as electronic
   commerce, network control and management, and remote login
   applications, would also benefit from a differentiated treatment.

   The IETF has two main models for providing differentiated treatment
   of packets in routers.  The Integrated Services (IntServ) model
   [RFC1633] together with the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
   [RFC2205] [RFC2210] [RFC2961] provides per-flow guaranteed end-to-end
   transmission service.  The Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
   framework [RFC2475] provides non- signaled flow differentiation that
   usually provides, but does not guarantee, proper transmission
   service.

   However, these architectures have potential weaknesses for deployment
   in Mobile Access Networks.  For example, RSVP requires support from
   both communication end points, and the protocol may have potential
   performance issues in mobile environments.  DiffServ can only provide
   statistical guarantees and is not well suited for dynamic
   environments.

   Let us consider a scenario, where a fixed network correspondent node
   (CN) would be sending a multimedia stream to an end host behind a
   wireless link.  If the correspondent node does not support RSVP it
   cannot signal its traffic characteristics to the network and request
   specific forwarding services.  Likewise, if the correspondent node is
   not able to mark its traffic with a proper DiffServ Code Point (DSCP)
   to trigger service differentiation, the multimedia stream will get
   only best-effort service which may result in poor visual and audio
   quality in the receiving application.  Even if the connecting wired
   network is over-provisioned, an end host would still benefit from
   local resource reservations, especially in wireless access networks,
   where the bottleneck resource is most probably the wireless link.

   RSVP proxies would be a very beneficial solution to this problem.  It
   would allow distinguishing local network reservations from the end-
   to-end reservations.  The end host does not need to know the access
   network topology or the nodes that will reserve the local resources.
   The access network would do resource reservations for both incoming
   and outgoing flows based on certain criterion, e.g., filters based on
   application protocols.  Another option is that the mobile end host
   makes an explicit reservation that identifies the intention and the
   access network will find the correct local access network node(s) to
   respond to the reservation.  RSVP proxies would, thus, allow resource
   reservation over the segment which is the most likely bottleneck, the
   wireless connectivity.  If the wireless access network uses a local
   mobility management mechanism, where the IP address of the mobile

   node does not change during handover, RSVP reservations would follow
   the mobile node movement.

A.5.  RSVP Proxies for Reservations in the presence of IPsec Gateways

   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-vpn-signaled-preemption] discusses how resource
   reservation can be supported end-to-end in a nested VPN environment.
   At each VPN level, VPN Routers behave as [RFC4301] security gateways
   between a plaintext domain and a cyphertext domain.  To achieve end-
   to-end resource reservation, the VPN Routers process RSVP signaling
   on the plaintext side, perform aggregation of plaintext reservations,
   and maintain the corresponding aggregate RSVP reservations on the
   cyphertext side.  Each aggregate reservation is established on behalf
   of multiple encrypted end-to-end sessions sharing the same ingress
   and egress VPN Routers.  These aggregate reservations can be as
   specified in [RFC3175] or [RFC4860].

   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-vpn-signaled-preemption] discusses the
   necessary data flows within a VPN Router to achieve the behavior
   described in the previous paragraph.  Two mechanisms are described to
   achieve such data flows.  Section 3.1 presents the case where the VPN
   Router carries data across the cryptographic boundary.  Section 3.2
   discusses the case where the VPN router uses a Network-Guard.

   Where such mechanisms are not supported by the VPN Routers, the
   approach for end-to-end reservation presented in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-vpn-signaled-preemption] cannot be deployed.  An
   alternative approach to support resource reservations within the
   cyphertext core is to use the "Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy"
   approach (as defined in Section 4.5) in the following way:

   o  the RSVP Proxies are located inside the cyphertext domain and use
      aggregate RSVP reservations,

   o  the Application Entity exchange application level signaling with
      the end systems in the plaintext domain,

   o  the Application Entity controls the RSVP Proxies in the cyphertext
      domain via an RSVP Proxy control interface

   This is illustrated in Figure 17 in the case where the application is
   SIP-based multimedia communications.

                                 Gateways

   Where the sender and receiver are RSVP capable, they may also use
   RSVP signaling.  This achieves resource reservation on the plaintext
   segments of the end-to-end i.e. :

   o  from the sender to the ingress IPsec gateway and

   o  from the egress IPsec gateway to the receiver.

   In this use case, because the VPN Routers do not support any RSVP
   specific mechanism, the end-to-end RSVP signaling is effectively
   hidden by the IPsec gateways on the cyphertext segment of the end-to-
   end path.

   As with the "Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy" approach (defined
   in Section 4.5), the solution here for synchronizing RSVP signaling
   with application-level signaling is to rely on an application-level
   signaling device that controls an on-path RSVP Proxy function.
   However, in the present use case, the RSVP Proxies are a component of
   a cyphertext network where all user (bearer) traffic is IPsec
   encrypted.  This has a number of implications including the
   following:

   1.  encrypted flows can not be identified in the cyphertext domain so
       that network nodes can only classify traffic based on IP address
       and DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs).  As a result, only aggregate
       RSVP reservations (such as those specified in [RFC3175] or
       [RFC4860] ) can be used.  This is similar to
       [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-vpn-signaled-preemption].

   2.  Determining the RSVP Sender proxy and RSVP receiver Proxy to be
       used for aggregation of a given flow from sender to receiver
       creates a number of challenges.  Details on how this may be
       achieved are beyond the scope of this document.  We observe that,
       as illustrated in Figure 17, this may be facilitated by a network
       management interface between the application entity and the IPsec
       gateways.  For example, this interface may be used by the
       application entity to obtain information about which IPsec
       gateway is on the path of a given end-to-end flow.  Then, the
       application entity may maintain awareness of which RSVP Proxy is
       on the cyphertext path between a given pair of IPsec gateways.
       How such awareness is achieved is beyond the scope of this
       document.  We simply observe that such awareness can be easily
       achieved through simple configuration in the particular case
       where a single (physical or logical) RSVP Proxy is fronting a
       given IPsec gateway.  We also observe that when awareness of the
       RSVP Receiver Proxy for a particular egress IPsec gateway (or

       end-to-end flow) is not available, the aggregate reservation may
       be signaled by the RSVP Sender Proxy to the destination address
       of the egress IPsec gateway and then proxied by the RSVP Receiver
       Proxy.

   Different flavors of operations are possible in terms of aggregate
   reservation sizing.  For example, the application entity can initiate
   an aggregate reservation of fixed size a priori and then simply keep
   count of the bandwidth used by sessions and reject sessions that
   would result in excess usage of an aggregate reservation.  The
   application entity could also re-size the aggregate reservations on a
   session by session basis.  Alternatively, the application entity
   could re-size the aggregate reservations in step increments typically
   corresponding to the bandwidth requirement of multiple sessions.
