Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for UEMCLIP             May 2009


Abstract

   This document describes the RTP payload format of a mU-law EMbedded
   Coder for Low-delay IP communication (UEMCLIP), an enhanced speech
   codec of ITU-T G.711.  The bitstream has a scalable structure with an
   embedded u-law bitstream, also known as PCMU, thus providing a handy
   transcoding operation between narrowband and wideband speech.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for UEMCLIP             May 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the payload format for sending "mU-law
   EMbedded Coder for Low-delay IP communication" (UEMCLIP) encoded
   speech using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].
   UEMCLIP is a proprietary codec which enhances u-law ITU-T G.711
   [ITU-T G.711], and designed to help the market for smooth transition
   towards the forthcoming wideband communication environment while
   achieving a very little media transcoding load with the existing
   terminals, in which the implementation of G.711 is mandatory.

   It should be noted that, generally speaking, codecs are negotiated
   and changed using an SDP exchange.  Also, [RFC3550] defines general
   RTP mixer and translator models, where media transcoding may not take
   place at the node.  For those cases, the design concept of the
   embedded structure is not useful.  However, there are other cases
   when costly transcoding is unavoidable in commonly deployed types of
   Multi-point Control Units (MCUs) which terminates media and RTCP
   packets [RFC5117], and when narrowband and wideband terminals co-
   exist.  This embedded bitstream structure can reduce the media
   transcoding to a simple bitstream truncation.

   The background and the basic idea of the media format is described in
   Section 2.  The details of the payload format are given in Section 3.
   The transcoding issues with G.711 are discussed in Section 4, and the
   considerations for congestion control are in Section 5.  In
   Section 6, the payload format parameters for a media type
   registration for UEMCLIP RTP payload format and SDP mappings are
   provided.  The security considerations and IANA considerations are
   dealt in Section 7 and Section 8, respectively.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Media Format Background

   UEMCLIP is an enhanced version of u-law ITU-T G.711, otherwise known
   as PCMU [RFC4856].  It is targeted at Voice over Internet Protocol
   (VoIP) applications, and its main goal is to provide a wideband
   communication platform that is highly interoperable with existing
   terminals equipped with G.711, and to stimulate the market to
   gradually shift to using wideband communication.  In widely deployed
   multi-point conferencing systems, the packets usually go through
   RTCP-terminating MCUs, "Topo-RTCP-terminating-MCU" as defined in
   [RFC5117].  Because the G.711 bitstream is embedded in the bitstream,
   costly media transcoding can be avoided in this case.

   This document does not discuss the implementation details of the
   encoder and decoder, but only describes the bitstream format.

   Because of its scalable nature, there are a number of sub-bitstreams
   (sub-layer) in a UEMCLIP bitstream.  By choosing appropriate sub-
   layers, the codec can adapt to the following requirements:

   o  Sampling frequency,

   o  Number of channels,

   o  Speech quality, and

   o  Bit-rate.

   The UEMCLIP codec operates at 20-ms frame, and includes three sub-
   coders as shown in Table 1.  The core layer is u-law G.711 at 64
   kbit/s, and other two are quality and bandwidth enhancement layers
   with bit-rate of 16 kbit/s each.

   +-------+---------------------+----------+--------------------------+
   | Layer | Description         | Bit-rate | Coding algorithm         |
   +-------+---------------------+----------+--------------------------+
   |   a   | G.711 core          |       64 | u-law PCM                |
   |       |                     |          |                          |
   |   b   | Lower-band          |       16 | Time domain block        |
   |       | enhancement         |          | quantization             |
   |       |                     |          |                          |
   |   c   | Higher-band         |       16 | MDCT block quantization  |
   +-------+---------------------+----------+--------------------------+

                      Table 1: Sub-layer description

   Based on these sub-layers, UEMCLIP codec operates in four modes as
   shown in Table 2.  Here, "Ch" is the number of channels and "Fs" is

   the sampling frequency in kHz.  It should be noted that the current
   version only supports single channel operation and there might be
   future extensions with multi-channel capabilities.  The absent Modes
   2 and 5 are reserved for possible future extension to 32 kHz sampling
   modes.  As the mode definition is expected to grow, any other modes
   not defined in this table MUST NOT be used for compatibility and
   interoperability reasons.

                         Table 2: Mode description

   UEMCLIP bitstream contains internal headers and other side-
   information apart from the layer data.  This results in total bit-
   rate larger than the sum of the layers shown in the above table.  The
   detail of the internal headers and auxiliary information are
   described in Section 3.3.1.

   Defining the sampling frequency and the number of channels does not
   result in a singular mode, i.e., there can be multiple modes for the
   same sampling frequency or number of channels.  The supported modes
   would differ between implementations, thus the sender and the
   receiver must negotiate what mode to use for transmission.

   As an RTP payload, UEMCLIP bitstream can contain one or more frames
   as shown in Figure 1.

                       Figure 1: RTP payload format

   UEMCLIP bitstream has a scalable structure, thus it is possible to
   reconstruct the signal by decoding a part of it.  A UEMCLIP frame is
   composed of a main header (MH) followed by one or more (up to three)
   sub-layers (SL) as shown in Figure 2.

                            +--+-------+//-+
                            |MH| SL #1 |...|
                            +--+-------+//-+

               Figure 2: A UEMCLIP frame (bitstream format)

   As a sub-layer, the core layer, i.e., "Layer a", MUST always be
   included.  It should be noted that the location of the core layer may
   not immediately follow MH field.  The decoder MUST always refer to
   the layer indices for proper decoding.

   The UEMCLIP bitstream does not explicitly include the following
   information: mode and sampling frequency (Fs).  As described before,
   this information MUST be exchanged while establishing a connection,
   for example, by means of SDP.

3.1.  RTP Header Usage

   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header, as explained in
   [RFC3550].  The following fields of the RTP fixed header used
   specifically for UEMCLIP streams are emphasized:

   Payload type:  The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet
      format is outside the scope of this document, however, it is
      expected that a payload type in the dynamic range shall be
      assigned.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for UEMCLIP             May 2009


   Timestamp:  This encodes the sampling instant of the first speech
      signal sample in the RTP data packet.  For UEMCLIP streams, the
      RTP timestamp MUST advance based on a clock either at 8000 or
      16000 (Hz).  In cases where the audio sampling rate can change
      during a session, the RTP timestamp rate MUST equal to the maximum
      rate (in Hz) given in the mode range (see Section 6.2.1).  This
      implies that the RTP timestamp rate for UEMCLIP payload type MUST
      NOT change during a session.  For example, for a UEMCLIP stream
      with 8-kHz audio sampling, where a transition to a 16-kHz audio
      sampling mode is allowed, the RTP time stamp must always advance
      using 16-kHz clock rate.  For a fixed audio sampling mode, the RTP
      timestamp rate should be either 8 or 16 kHz, depending on the
      sampling rate.

   Marker bit:  If the codec is used for applications with discontinuous
      transmission (DTX, or silence compression), the first packet after
      a silence period during which packets have not been transmitted
      contiguously SHOULD have the marker bit in the RTP data header set
      to one.  The marker bit in all other packets MUST be zero.
      Applications without DTX MUST set the marker bit to zero.

3.2.  Multiple frames in an RTP packet

   More than one UEMCLIP frame may be included in a single RTP packet by
   a sender.  However, senders have the following additional
   restrictions:

   o  A single RTP packet SHOULD NOT include more UEMCLIP frames than
      will fit in the path MTU.

   o  All frames contained in a single RTP packet MUST be of the same
      mode.

   o  Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP
   packet be consistent with the application.  Since UEMCLIP is designed
   for telephony application where delay has a great impact on the
   quality, then fewer frames per packet for lower delay, is preferable.

3.3.  Payload Data

   In a UEMCLIP bitstream, all numbers are encoded in a network byte-
   order.

3.3.1.  Main Header

      Validity flag of V1 and PW1.  This bit being "1" indicates that
      both parameters are valid, and "0" indicates that the parameters
      should be ignored.  If any of these parameters is invalid, this
      bit should be set to "0".  This flag is mainly intended for a
      UEMCLIP-conscious Topo-RTCP-terminating-MCU.  This flag should be
      set to "0" in case of upward transcoding from G.711 (See
      Section 4).

   Reserved bit #1 (R1):  1 bit

      This bit should be ignored.  The default of this bit is 0.

   VAD flag #1 (V1):  1 bit

      Voice activity detection flag of the current frame, designed to be
      used for MCU operations.  This flag being "1" indicates that the
      frame is an active (voice) segment, and "0" indicates that it is
      an inactive (non-voice) or a silent segment.  This flag is
      specifically designed for mixing information.  DTX judgment based
      this flag is not recommended.

   Power #1 (PW1):  5 bits

      Signal power code of the current frame.  The code is obtained by
      calculating a root mean square (RMS) of "Layer a" and encoding
      this RMS using G.711 u-law [ITU-T G.711].  Denoting the encoded
      RMS as R, then PW1 is obtained by PW1 = ((~R)>>2) & 0x1F, where
      "~", ">>", "&" are one's complement arithmetic, right SHIFT, and
      bitwise AND operators, respectively.

   Reserved bit #2 (R2):  2 bits

      These bits should be ignored.  The default of these bits are 0.

   VAD flag #2 (V2):  1 bit

      Voice activity detection flag of the current frame, designed to be
      used for packet-loss concealment.  This might not be as same as V1
      in the mixing information, and might not be synchronous to the
      marker bit in the RTP header.  DTX judgment based this flag is not
      recommended.

   Frame indicator (K):  4 bits

      This value indicates the frame offset of U2, P2 and PW2.  Since it
      is a better idea to carry the speech feature parameters as PLC
      information in a different frame to maintain the speech quality,
      this frame offset value gives which frame the parameters are to be
      associated with.  The value ranges between "0" and "15".  If the
      current frame number is N, for example, the value K indicates that
      U2, P2 and PW2 are associated with frame of N-K.  Frame indicator
      is equal to the difference in the RTP sequence number when one
      UEMCLIP frame is contained in a single RTP packet.

   V/UV flag #1 (U1):  1 bit

      Voiced/Unvoiced signal indicator of the current frame.  This flag
      being "0" indicates that the frame is a voiced signal segment, and
      "1" indicates that it is an unvoiced signal segment.

   Pitch lag #1 (P1):  7 bits

      Pitch code of the current frame.  The actual pitch lag is
      calculated as P1+20 samples in 8-kHz sampling rate.  Pitch lag
      must be 20 <= pitch length <= 120.  Codes ranging between "0x65"
      and "0x7F" are not used.  To obtain the pitch lag, any pitch
      estimation method can be used, such as the one used in G.711
      Appendix I [ITU-T G.711 Appendix 1].

   V/UV flag #2 (U2):  1 bit

      Voiced/Unvoiced signal indicator of the offset frame.  This flag
      being "0" indicates that the frame is a voiced signal segment, and
      "1" indicates that it is an unvoiced signal segment.  The offset
      value is defined as K.

   Pitch lag #2 (P2):  7 bits

      Pitch code of the offset frame.  The offset value is defined as K.
      The calculation method is identical to "P1", except that it is
      based on the signal of offset frame.

   Power #2 (PW2):  8 bits

      Signal power code of the offset frame.  The offset value is
      defined as K.

   Reserved bits #3 (R3):  8 bits

      These bits should be ignored.  The default of all bits are "0".

3.3.2.  Sub-layer

   Sub-layer (SL) is a sub-header followed by layer bitstreams, as shown
   in Figure 6.  The sub-header indicates the layer location and the
   number of bytes.

      base frequency band, higher number means that the layer is in
      respective frequency band.  The detail is given in Table 3.

   Quality index (QI):  2 bits

      Indicates the quality layer number. "0" means that the layer is in
      the base layer, and higher number means that the layer is in

4.  Transcoding between UEMCLIP and G.711

   As given in Section 2, u-law encoded G.711 bitstream (Layer a) is the
   core layer of a UEMCLIP bitstream, and is always embedded.  This
   means that media transcoding from UEMCLIP bitstream to G.711 does not
   have to undergo decoding and re-encoding procedures, but simple
   extraction would suffice.  However, this does not apply for the
   reverse procedure, i.e., transcoding from G.711 to UEMCLIP, because
   the auxiliary information in the main header (MH) must be assigned
   separately.  It should be noted that this media transcoding is useful
   for a Media Translator (Topo-Media-Translator) or a Point to
   Multipoint Using RTCP Terminating MCU (Topo-RTCP-terminating-MCU) in
   [RFC5117] and all the requirements apply.  This means that a
   transcoding device of this sort MUST rewrite RTCP packets, together
   with the RTP media packets.

   The transcoding from UEMCLIP to u-law G.711 can be done easily by
   finding an appropriate sub-layer.  Within a frame, the transcoder
   should look for a sub-layer with layer index "0x00", and subsequent
   LD which has size of SB*8 bits (UEMCLIP has a 20-ms frame thus,
   SB=160) are the actual G.711 bitstream data.  It should be noted that
   transcoder should not always expect the core layer to be located
   right after the main header.

   On the other hand, the transcoding from G.711 to UEMCLIP is not
   entirely straight-forward.  Since there are no means to generate
   enhancement sub-layers, a G.711 bitstream can only be converted to
   UEMCLIP Mode 0 bitstream.  If the original G.711 bitstream is encoded
   in A-law, it should first be converted to u-law to become the core
   layer.  Because a UEMCLIP frame size is 20 ms, u-law encoded G.711
   bitstream MUST be a 160-sample chunk to become a core layer.  For the
   main header contents, when the UEMCLIP encoder is not available, it
   should follow the following guidelines.

   o  The check bits for mixing and PLC (C1 and C2) are set to 0.

   o  The reserved bits (R1 to R3) in MH are set to respective default
      values.

   For the core layer (i.e., u-law G.711 bitstream), it should have the
   following sub-layer header:

   o  All CI, FI, QI, and R4 MUST be 0.

   o  Sub-layer size (SB) MUST be 160 for 20 ms frame.

5.  Congestion Control Considerations

   The general congestion control considerations for transporting RTP
   data also apply to UEMCLIP over RTP [RFC3550] as well as any
   applicable RTP profile like AVP [RFC3551].

   The bandwidth of a UEMCLIP bitstream can be reduced by changing to
   lower-bit-rate modes.  The embedded layer structure of UEMCLIP may
   help to control congestion, when dynamic mode changing (see
   Section 6.2.1) is available, and the range of modes is obtained by
   offer-answer negotiation as given in Section 6.3.  It should be noted
   that this involves proper RTCP handling when the bit-rate is modified
   in an RTP translator or a mixer [RFC3550].

   Packing more frames in each RTP payload can reduce the number of
   packets sent, and hence the overhead from IP/UDP/RTP headers, at the
   expense of increased delay and reduced error robustness against
   packet losses.  It should be treated with care because increased
   delay means reduced quality.

6.  Payload Format Parameters

6.1.  Media type registration

   This registration is done using the template defined in [RFC4288] and
   following [RFC4855].

   Media type name:  audio

   Media subtype name:  UEMCLIP

   Required parameters:

      Rate:  Defines the sampling rate, and MUST be either 8000 or
         16000.  See Section 6.2.1 "Mode specification" of RFC xxxx
         (this RFC) for details.

   Security considerations:  See Section 7 "Security Considerations" of
      RFC xxxx (this RFC).

   Interoperability considerations:  This media may be readily
      transcoded to u-law encoded ITU-T G.711.  See Section 4
      "Transcoding between UEMCLIP and G.711" of RFC xxxx (this RFC).

6.2.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

   The media types audio/UEMCLIP are mapped to fields in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] as follows:

   Media name:  The "m=" line of SDP MUST be audio.

   Encoding name:  Registered media subtype name should be used for the
      "a=rtpmap" line.

   Sampling Frequency:  Depending on the mode, clock rate (sampling
      frequency) specified in "a=rtpmap" MUST be selected from the ones
      defined in Table 2.  See Section 6.2.1 for details.

   Encoding parameters:  Since this is an audio stream, the encoding
      parameters indicate the number of audio channels, and this SHOULD
      default to "1", as selected from the ones defined in Table 2.
      This is OPTIONAL.

   Packet time:  A frame length of any UEMCLIP is 20 ms, thus the
      argument of "a=ptime" SHOULD be a multiple of "20".  When not
      listed in SDP, it should also default to the minimum size: "20".

   UMECLIP specific:  Any description specific to UEMCLIP are defined in
      the Format Specification Parameters ("a=fmtp").  Each parameter
      MUST be separated with ";", and if any attributes (value) exists,
      it MUST be defined with "=".  For compatibility reasons, any
      application/terminal MUST ignore any parameters that it does not
      understand.  This is to ensure the upper-compatibility with
      parameters added in future enhancements.  The mode specification
      should be made here (see Section 6.2.1).

6.2.1.  Mode specification

   Since UEMCLIP codec can operate in number of modes (bit-rates), it is
   desirable to specify the range of modes that an encoder or a decoder
   can operate at.  When exchanging SDP messages, an offerer should
   specify all possible combination of mode numbers as arguments to
   "mode=" in "a=fmtp" line, delimited by commas ",".  In case of
   specifying multiple modes, those SHOULD appear in the descending
   priority order.

   Although UEMCLIP decoders SHOULD accept bitstreams in any modes, an
   implementation may fail to adopt to the dynamic mode changes during a
   session.  For this reason, an application may choose to operate
   either with one fixed mode or with multiple modes that can be
   dynamically changed.  If the mode is to be fixed and changes are not
   allowed, this can be indicated by specifying a single mode per
   payload type.

   The mode numbers that can be specified in a payload type as arguments
   to "mode" are restricted by a combination of a clock rate and a
   number of audio channels.  This is because SDP binds a payload type
   to a combination of a sampling frequency and a number of audio
   channels.  Table 4 gives selectable mode numbers that attributed with
   clock rates.  When mode specifications are not given at all, a
   payload type MUST default to a single mode using the default value
   specified in this table.

        +------------+----------+------------------+--------------+
        | Clock rate | Channels | Selectable modes | Default mode |
        +------------+----------+------------------+--------------+
        |       8000 |     1    |        0,3       |       0      |
        |            |          |                  |              |
        |      16000 |     1    |      0,1,3,4     |       1      |
        +------------+----------+------------------+--------------+

                          Table 4: Default modes

   It should be noted that a mode attributed with a larger sampling
   frequency (Fs) is not used in conjunction with smaller clock rates
   specified in "a=rtpmap".  This means that Modes 0 and 3 can be
   specified in a payload type having clock rate of both 8000 and 16000
   in "a=rtpmap", but Modes 1 and 4 cannot be specified with one having
   clock rate of 8000.

6.3.1.  Offer-Answer Guidelines

   The procedures related to exchanging SDP messages MUST follow
   [RFC3264].  The following is a detalied list on the semantics of
   using the UEMCLIP payload format in an offer-answer exchange.

   o  An offerer SHOULD offer every possible combination of UEMCLIP
      payload type it can handle, i.e., sampling frequency, channel
      number, and fmtp parameters, in a preferred order.  When the
      transmission bandwidth is restricted, it MUST be offered in
      accordance to the restriction.

   o  When multiple UEMCLIP payload types are offered, it is RECOMMENDED
      that the answerer selects a single UEMCLIP payload type and
      answers it back.

   o  In a UEMCLIP payload type, an answerer MUST answer back suitable
      mode number(s) as a subset of what has been offered.  This means
      that there is a symmetry assumption on sent and received streams,
      and offerer MUST NOT send in modes that it does not offer.

   o  In an offering/answering SDP, any fmtp parameters which are not
      known MUST be ignored.  If any unknown/undefined parameters should
      be offered, an answerer MUST delete the entry from the answer
      message.

   o  A receiver of an SDP message MUST only use specified payload types
      and modes.  When a mode specification is missing, i.e., a mode is
      not specified at all, the session MUST default to one single mode
      without mode changes during a session.  For this case, the default
      mode values, as shown in Table 4, MUST be used based on the
      sampling frequency and number of channels.  This table must be
      looked up only when there are no mode specifications, thus the
      offerer/answerer MUST NOT assume that the default modes are always
      available when it is not in the specified list of modes.

   o  When an offered condition does not fit an answerer's capabilities,
      it naturally MUST NOT answer any of the conditions, and session
      MAY proceed to re-INVITE, if possible.  If a condition (mode) is
      decided upon, an offerer and an answerer MUST transmit on this
      condition.

6.3.2.  Examples

   When an offerer indicates that he/she wishes to dynamically switch
   between modes (0,1,3, and 4) during a session, an example of an
   offered SDP can be:

     a=rtpmap:96 UEMCLIP/16000/1
     a=fmtp:96 mode=4,1,3,0

   It should be noted that the listed modes appears in the offerer's
   preference.

   When an answerer can only operate in Modes 1 and 0 but can
   dynamically switch between those modes during a session, an answerer
   MUST delete the entries of Mode 3 and 4, and answer back as:

     v=0
     o=lena 549947322 549947322 IN IP4 anshost.example.org
     s=-
     c=IN IP4 anshost.example.org

     m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 UEMCLIP/16000/1
     a=fmtp:96 mode=1,0

   As a result, both would start communicating in either Mode 1 or 0,
   and can dynamically switch between those modes during the session.

   On the other hand, when the answerer is capable of communicating
   either in Modes 1 or 0, and cannot switch between modes during a
   session, an example of such answer is as follows:

     v=0
     o=lena 549947322 549947322 IN IP4 anshost.example.org
     s=-
     c=IN IP4 anshost.example.org
     t=0 0
     m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 UEMCLIP/16000/1
     a=fmtp:96 mode=1

   As a result, both will start communicating in Mode 1.  It should be
   noted that mode change during this session is not allowed because the
   answerer responded with a single mode, and answerer selected Mode 1
   above Mode 0 according to the offered order.

   If an offerer does not want a mode change during a session but is
   capable of receiving either Modes 4 or 1 bitstreams, the SDP should

   somewhat look like:

     a=rtpmap:97 UEMCLIP/16000/1
     a=fmtp:97 mode=1

   and if the answerer prefers to communicate in Mode 1, an answer would
   be:

     v=0
     o=lena 549947322 549947322 IN IP4 anshost.example.org
     s=-

     m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 97
     a=rtpmap:97 UEMCLIP/16000/1
     a=fmtp:97 mode=1

   Please note that it is RECOMMENDED to select a single UEMCLIP payload
   type for answers.

   The "ptime" attribute is used to denote the desired packetization
   interval.  When not specified, it SHOULD default to 20.  Since
   UEMCLIP uses 20 msec frames, ptime values of multiples of 20 imply
   multiple frames per packet.  In the example below, the ptime is set
   to 60, and this means that offerer wants to receive 3 frames in each
   packet.

     v=0
     o=kosuke 2890844730 2890844730 IN IP4 anotherhost.example.com
     s=-
     c=IN IP4 anotherhost.example.com
     t=0 0
     m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 96
     a=ptime:60
     a=rtpmap:96 UEMCLIP/16000/1

   When mode specification is not present, it should default to a fixed
   mode, and in this case, Mode 1 (see Section 6.2.1).

7.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and any appropriate profiles.  This implies
   that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption
   unless the applicable profile specifies other means.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream that are complex to decode and cause the receiver
   output to become overloaded.  However, UEMCLIP covered in this
   document do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.

   Another potential threats are memory attacks by illegal layer indices
   or byte numbers.  The implementor of the decoder should always be
   aware that the indicated numbers may be corrupted and does not point
   to the right sub-layer and may force reading beyond the bitstream
   boundaries.  It is advised that a decoder implementation rejects
   layers such indices.

8.  IANA Considerations

   It is requested that one new media subtype (audio/UEMCLIP) is
   registered by IANA.  For details, see Section 6.1.
