1.  Introduction

   The Russian Federal standard [GOSTR3412-2015] specifies basic block
   ciphers used as cryptographic techniques for information processing
   and information protection including the provision of
   confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of information during
   information transmission, processing and storage in computer-aided
   systems.

   The cryptographic algorithms specified in this Standard are designed
   both for hardware and software implementation.  They comply with
   modern cryptographic requirements, and put no restrictions on the
   confidentiality level of the protected information.

2.  General Information

   The Russian Federal standard [GOSTR3412-2015] was developed by the
   Center for Information Protection and Special Communications of the
   Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation with participation
   of the Open Joint-Stock company "Information Technologies and
   Communication Systems" (InfoTeCS JSC).  GOST R 34.12-2015 was
   approved and introduced by Decree #749 of the Federal Agency on
   Technical Regulating and Metrology on 19.06.2015.

   Terms and concepts in the standard comply with the following
   international standards:

   o  ISO/IEC 10116 [ISO-IEC10116],

   o  series of standards ISO/IEC 18033 [ISO-IEC18033-1],
      [ISO-IEC18033-3].

3.  Definitions and Notations

   The following terms and their corresponding definitions are used in
   the standard.

3.1.  Definitions

   Definitions

      encryption algorithm: process which transforms plaintext into
      ciphertext (Clause 2.19 of [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

      decryption algorithm: process which transforms ciphertext into
      plaintext (Clause 2.14 of [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

      basic block cipher: block cipher which for a given key provides a
      single invertible mapping of the set of fixed-length plaintext
      blocks into ciphertext blocks of the same length,

      block: string of bits of a defined length (Clause 2.6 of
      [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

      block cipher: symmetric encipherment system with the property that
      the encryption algorithm operates on a block of plaintext, i.e. a
      string of bits of a defined length, to yield a block of ciphertext
      (Clause 2.7 of [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

         Note: In GOST R 34.12-2015, it is established that the terms
         "block cipher" and "block encryption algorithm" are synonyms.

      encryption: reversible transformation of data by a cryptographic
      algorithm to produce ciphertext, i.e., to hide the information
      content of the data (Clause 2.18 of [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

      round key: sequence of symbols which is calculated from the key
      and controls a transformation for one round of a block cipher,

      key: sequence of symbols that controls the operation of a
      cryptographic transformation (e.g., encipherment, decipherment)
      (Clause 2.21 of [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

         Note: In GOST R 34.12-2015, the key must be a binary sequence.

      [ISO-IEC10116]),

      key schedule: calculation of round keys from the key,

      decryption: reversal of a corresponding encipherment (Clause 2.13
      of [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

      symmetric cryptographic technique: cryptographic technique that
      uses the same secret key for both the originator's and the
      recipient's transformation (Clause 2.32 of [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

      cipher: alternative term for encipherment system (Clause 2.20 of
      [ISO-IEC18033-1]),

      ciphertext: data which has been transformed to hide its
      information content (Clause 3.3 of [ISO-IEC10116]).

Appendix B.  Background

   Algoritmically Magma is a variation of block cipher defined in
   [RFC5830] ([GOST28147-89]) with the following clarifications and
   minor modifications:

   1.  S-BOX set is fixed at id-tc26-gost-28147-param-Z (See Appendix C
       of [RFC7836]);

   2.  key is parsed as a single big-endian integer (compared to little-
       endian approach used in [GOST28147-89]), which results in
       different subkey values being used;

   3.  data are also parsed as single big-endian integer (instead of
       being parsed as little-endian integer).
