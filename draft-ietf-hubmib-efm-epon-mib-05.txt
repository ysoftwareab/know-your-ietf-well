1.2.1.  Introduction

   The EPON standard, as defined in [802.3ah], is defining the physical
   media (Layer 1) and media access (layer 2) of the EPON interface.
   The EPON is a variant of the Gigabit Ethernet protocol for the
   Optical Access.  The Optical Access topology is based on passive
   optical splitting topology.  The link of a Passive Optical Network
   (PON) is based on a single, shared optical fiber with passive optical
   splitters dividing the single fiber into separate subscribers.

   The Optical Line Terminal (OLT) is the server unit of the network,
   located at the Central Office (CO).

   The Optical Network Unit (ONU) is the client unit of the network,
   located at the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).

   The following diagram describes the PON topology:

   The IEEE layering architecture of an EPON interface is defined in the
   diagram of figure 56.2 [802.3ah].  The following clauses in the
   [802.3ah] define the corresponding layers of an EPON interface:

   Clause 30 - management

   Clause 60 - PMD for EPON media (Burst PMD)

   Clause 64 - MPCP (Multipoint control protocol) - defines the
   multipoint architecture, and control protocol for the media access of
   EPON.

   Clause 65 -

   a) Virtual links definition for the EPON

   b) FEC

   c) PMA for the EPON.

1.2.2.  Principles of operation

   The specification of the EPON interface is based on the specification
   of the gigabit Ethernet interface as described in [802.3] clause 35
   and 36.  The Ethernet MAC is working in gigabit rate.  The media
   interface to the MAC is through the GMII interface as described in
   clause 35 and the PCS layer is based on the gigabit Ethernet PCS as
   described in clause 36.  The special EPON layers are added to the
   Ethernet layering in the following places:

   The MPCP is placed in the MAC control layer, providing the EPON
   control protocol.  The Emulation layer, located at the RS
   (Reconciliation Sublayer), creates virtual private path to each ONU.
   The FEC layer is located between the PCS and PMA layers, enhancing
   reach and split performance of the optical link.

1.2.3.  The physical media

   The physical link is a fiber optical link.  The OLT and ONUs are
   connected through passive optical splitters.  Downlink denotes the
   transmission from the OLT to the ONUs.  Uplink denotes the
   transmission from the ONUs to the OLT.  Uplink and downlink are
   multiplexed using separated wavelengths on the same fiber.  The
   downlink is a broadcast medium where the OLT transmits the data to
   all ONUs.  The uplink is a shared transmission medium for all of the
   ONUs.  The uplink access is based on time division multiplexing (TDM)



Khermosh                Expires January 24, 2007                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           Managed Objects of EPON               July 2006


   and the management of the TDM media access is defined by the Multi-
   Point control protocol (MPCP).  The MPCP is a control protocol based
   on an inband packet messaging.  The OLT sends control messages (GATE
   messages) allowing ONUs to transmit, defining when the transmission
   occurs and what is its duration.  These messages define the
   transmission order and the amount of BW for each ONU.  A scheduling
   algorithm at the OLT, which is not defined in the [802.3ah], is
   responsible of allocating the BW and controlling the delay of each
   ONU according to its SLA.

1.2.4.  PMD specifications

   The same optical wavelength plan as the [ITU-T G.983] is selected.
   The transceivers are derivatives of existing Ethernet optical
   transceivers, with dual wavelength on a single fiber and extended
   burst capabilities for the uplink.  The uplink burst capability is
   the burst transmission functionality for the ONUs and burst reception
   functionality for the OLT.  The [802.3ah] selected very relaxed burst
   parameters to reduce the device cost of EPON products.

1.2.5.  Point to point emulation

   The downstream is a broadcast link meaning the OLT transmission is
   shared for all ONUs.  The sharing of the transmission of the OLT has
   some negative privacy aspects, and should be limited to broadcast
   traffic in nature only.  The traffic dedicated to each ONU should not
   be shared.  The solution provided by the [802.3ah] is to partition
   the EPON link, in a virtual manner, between the ONUs.  Each ONU has a
   dedicated virtual link to the OLT.  The [802.3ah] also defines an
   additional link for broadcast transmission.  The medium becomes an
   aggregation of point-to-point tunnels.  The OLT can not preserve its
   EPON interface as a single interface connected to N devices
   (following the properties of the physical interface).  The EPON
   interface of the OLT is partitioned into separate virtual interfaces,
   an interface for each virtual link.  Hence the OLT behaves like a
   device with N virtual ports (and an additional port for the broadcast
   transmission).  The additional single-copy-broadcast channel (tagged
   as all ones LLID) is added to allow the broadcast transmission within
   a single copy to all ONUs, preserving the inherent advantage of BW
   efficiency of the PON shared media.  The ONUs filter the downlink
   traffic which is not intended for their reception, according to the
   virtual link marking.  An LLID tag is attached at the preamble of the
   Ethernet packet denoting the virtual link.  The LLID marks the
   destination port in the downstream and source port in the upstream.

   The virtual links concept is also used to avoid a violation of the
   [802.1d] bridging rules for peer to peer traffic in the PON.  Peer to
   peer traffic is traffic between ONUs in the same PON.  The OLT can

   not preserve the EPON interface as a single interface connected to N
   devices and allow traffic between these devices without violating the
   bridging rules.  The source address and destination address of the
   peer to peer traffic are behind the same port and therefore the
   traffic should be discarded.  The separation of the ONUs into virtual
   links solves this issue.  The OLT has N virtual ports for the single
   physical EPON port.  A bridge sees a single MAC Client for every link
   pair.

   The private paths concept solves the networking problems and it
   provides subscriber isolation.

   As the tunneling is only a virtual tunneling, there is a single
   physical interface and a single physical layer for the device so that
   some attributes are shared.  For example, the interface has a single
   local MAC address.

   The virtual tunneling for an OLT with 3 ONUs, is illustrated in the
   following diagram.

1.2.6.  Principles of the MPCP

   The EPON standard defines a media access control of an optical Access
   network.  The Access network has some substantial differences from
   the legacy LAN which the Ethernet was designed for.  The differences
   mainly lie in the provisioning of the network.  An Access network is
   an administrated environment, with an operator providing the service
   and subscribers consuming it.  The operator is controlling the
   network and managing its traffic.  For instance BW is controlled and
   subscribers are billed for services.  The MPCP protocol divides the
   Ethernet interfaces into two unequal types of network units.  The
   first interface is an OLT interface, which is a server unit,
   controlling the network.  The second interface is an ONU interface,
   which is a client unit, participating in the network.

   The OLT, which is the server unit, manages the network.  The MPCP
   controls the TDM transmission of the uplink.  The MPCP is implemented
   at the MAC control layer and the MPCP messages are MAC control
   messages using the 0x8808 Ethertype.  These messages are not
   forwarded out of the MAC.

   A concept of time must exist in the protocol in order to schedule the
   uplink transmission.  A timestamp which is set by the OLT and
   synchronized between the network units is passed through the MPCP
   messages.  The timestamp is also used to measure the RTT of each ONU.
   RTT is compensated by the OLT, in the generation of the grants for
   the uplink transmission.  The difference of incoming timestamp to
   local time allows the OLT to calculate the RTT.  RTT compensation is
   needed as the RTT in an Access network can have a significant value.
   The standard allows the network to reach a 20km distance which is
   equivalent to a 200usec RTT (25Kbytes of data).

   The TDM control is done using the GATE messages.  These messages
   define, for each ONU, the time for transmission and the length of
   transmission.  The RTT is reduced from the transmission time in the
   GATE message to shift the transmission time of the ONU in the
   opposite direction.

   A scheduling algorithm at the OLT, which is not defined in the
   [802.3ah], is responsible for dividing the BW and controlling the
   transmission delay of each ONU according to its SLA.  The MPCP
   defines a closed loop operation, in order for this algorithm to be
   efficient.  The MPCP allows the ONUs to report on the amount of BW
   they require for transmission using a special REPORT message.  This
   allows allocating BW to an ONU only when requested, relying on the
   statistical burst property of the traffic, allowing different peak BW
   for different ONUs at different times, hence allowing
   oversubscription of the BW.  The REPORT message reports the amount of
   data waiting in the ONU queues.

   In addition to that the MPCP defines a protocol of auto-discovery and
   registration of ONUs.

   A new ONU requests to register (sends a REG_REQUEST message) in a
   special discovery grant, allocated for that by the OLT.  During that
   time more than one ONU might try to register.  A collision in
   transmission might occur as the RTT of the new ONUs is not yet known.
   A random backoff mechanism of the transmission is used to schedule
   the following registration requests to avoid these collisions.  When
   the OLT receives REG_REQUEST message of an ONU and approves this ONU
   then it sends a REGISTER message to this ONU defining its LLID.  From
   that point the ONU transmission is scheduled by its LLID, knowing the
   RTT, and no collision can occur.  The ONU replies with a REGISTER_ACK
   message and the registration process of the MPCP ends.  Higher layer
   protocols may yet be needed to authenticate the ONU and allow it to
   participate in the network.

1.2.7.  Forward Error correction (FEC)

   The FEC is defined to enhance the link budget of the PON.  As each
   splitter attenuates the optical signal, the number of the splits and
   the distance are limited by the link budget.  Hence an FEC which
   improves the link budget, has a benefit.  The FEC code used is the
   RS(239,255,8), similar to the FEC code in [ITU-T G.975], improving
   the BER from 1E-4 to 1E-12.

   The FEC parity encapsulation is based on the framing of the Ethernet
   packet.  The Ethernet packets are spaced by MAC rate adaptation, and
   the parity bytes are inserted after the packet, in the provided
   space.

   As the start and end of packet codewords define also the FEC
   boundaries, and they are outside the FEC protection, they are
   replaced by a series of symbols to reduce their vulnerability to
   errors.

   The following diagram presents an FEC protected frame:



   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |       |              |           |     |       |          |       |
   | S_FEC | Preamble/SFD |   Frame   | FCS | T_FEC |  Parity  | T_FEC |
   |       |              |           |     |       |          |       |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+



   The FEC is added in a separate layer between the PCS and PMA layers
   of the [802.3].

   The FEC layer introduces a fixed delay in receive path and transmit
   path.

   The FEC layer is optional.

1.3.  Management architecture

   Each one of the EPON layers is accompanied with a management
   interface, which is controlled through clause 30 of the [802.3ah].
   As the [802.3ah] spec may be used for different applications and some
   of the clauses may be used separately, the IEEE management clause
   allocates for each one of them a separate package.  The MIB document
   follows this partition.

   The association is strait forward for the ONU interface.  There is
   one logical and one physical interface and a single copy exists for
   each layer, that can be remotely queried by the OLT.

   At the OLT there is a single physical interface and N virtual
   interfaces for the virtual links of the ONUs (and another virtual
   interface for the broadcast virtual link).  As can be seen from the
   layering diagram above, the MAC layer is virtually duplicated.

   Therefore in this document it was selected that the management of a
   virtual interface is like a physical interface and an interface index
   is allocated for each one of the virtual links and an additional
   interface index is allocated for the OLT.

   To illustrate the interface modeling, consider two devices.  The
   first device has two physical interfaces, is typically located at a
   consumer's site, and called an "ONU modem".

   An "ONU modem" is shown in the figure below:



                            --------
             ONU interface | ONU   | 10megabit interface
             --------------| modem |--------------------
                           ---------



   This device would have 3 entries in the IF table, and one IF stack
   entry, for example:

   ifIndex=1 - interface for 10megabit interface

   ifIndex=2 - interface for the optical interface

   ifIndex=200 - interface for the ONU interface

   And then in IF stack table:

   ifStackHigherLayer=200, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the
   physical and the ONU

   The second device has three physical interfaces, is typically located
   at the provider's site, and may be called a "headend".

   A "headend" is shown in the figure below:


                               ---------
             1st OLT interface | Head  | gigE interface
             ------------------| end   |--------------------
                               |       |
             ------------------|       |
             2nd OLT interface |       |
                               ---------

   This device would have 5 entries (when no attached ONUs) in the IF
   table, for example:

   ifIndex=1 - interface for gigE interface

   ifIndex=2 - interface for 1st optical interface

   ifIndex=3 - interface for 2nd optical interface

   ifIndex=265535 - interface for the 1st OLT broadcast interface

   ifIndex=365535 - interface for the 2nd OLT broadcast interface

   And then in IF stack table:

   ifStackHigherLayer=265535, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the 1st
   physical and its broadcast interface

   ifStackHigherLayer=365535, ifStackLowerLayer=3 - map between the 2nd
   physical and its broadcast interface

   If two ONUs connected to the first OLT interface, then for example,
   the following entries would be added to the IF table:

   ifIndex=200001 - interface for the 1st ONU of 1st OLT

   ifIndex=200002 - interface for the 2nd ONU of 1st OLT

   And in the IF stack table:

   ifStackHigherLayer=200001, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the 1st
   physical and 1st ONU

   ifStackHigherLayer=200002, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the 1st
   physical and 2nd ONU

   For each physical interface, there would be an entry (ifIndex) in the
   tables of the interface MIB module [RFC2863], MAU MIB module
   [RFC3636] and Etherlike MIB module [RFC3635].  Additionally, there
   would be entries (ifIndexes) for the virtual interfaces of the OLT
   interface.  The justification for the additional allocation of
   indexes is that the virtual interfaces are quite well distinguished
   as they connect different physical ONUs, from the OLT side.  For
   instance there is a meaning for separate bad frames counter or bad
   octets counter for each virtual link, as the ONUs can be differently
   distanced.  This is quite similar to a case of separate physical
   interfaces.

   The same partition concept exists for the MIB module of this
   document.  Each row in the tables is indexed according to the ifIndex
   and specifically there is a row for each virtual link.  There are
   some control objects which are shared and are the same for the
   virtual interfaces (and they should have the same value for each
   ifIndex) but most of the objects have different values for N+1
   logical interfaces at the OLT.  This is done for each MIB group.  It
   is a bit different from the [802.3ah] layering diagram which presents
   the P2MP layer as a single layer while duplicating the MAC and MAC
   client layers (Please see the diagram above).  However from
   management perspective it is more convenient and neat to partition
   the management of the layers for the virtual links, as the atomic
   managed entity is the virtual link.  It is also convenient to use the
   interface index of the virtual link for that purpose, as it is
   already used to index the rows of the virtual links at the Interface,
   MAU and etherLike interfaces MIBs.

2.  MIB structure

   This document defines the DOT3 EPON MIB module.  The DOT3 EPON MIB
   module defines the objects used for management of the [802.3ah] Point
   to Multipoint (P2MP) interfaces.  These MIB objects are included in
   four groups.

   i) The Multi-Point Control Protocol (MPCP) MIB objects - MIB objects
   related to [802.3ah] clause 64 Multi Point Control Protocol
   attributes.  The following tables are presented in this group:

   The dot3MpcpControlTable defines the objects used for the
   configuration and status indication, which are per logical link, of
   MPCP compliant interfaces.

   The dot3MpcpStatTable defines the statistics objects, which are per
   logical link, of MPCP compliant interfaces.

   The operational mode of an OLT/ONU for the tables is defined by the
   dot3MpcpMode object in the dot3MpcpControlTable.


   ii) The OMPEmulation MIB objects - MIB objects related to [802.3ah]
   clause 65 point to point emulation attributes.  The following tables
   are presented in this group:

   The dot3OmpEmulationTable defines the objects used for the
   configuration and status indication, which are per logical link, of
   OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.

   The dot3OmpEmulationStatTable defines the statistics objects which
   are per logical link, of OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.

   The operational mode of an OLT/ONU for the tables is defined by the
   dot3OmpEmulationType object in the dot3OmpEmulationTable.


   iii) The FEC MIB objects - MIB objects related to [802.3ah] clause 60
   and clause 65 EPON FEC attributes.  The following table is presented
   in this group:

   The dot3EponFecTable defines the objects used for the configuration
   and status indication, which are per logical link, of FEC EPON
   compliant interfaces.


   iv) The EPON extended package MIB objects - MIB objects used for
   configuration and status indication with extended capabilities of the

   EPON interfaces.  The following tables are presented in this group:

   The dot3ExtPkgControlTable defines the objects which are per logical
   link, used for the configuration and status indication of EPON
   compliant interfaces.

   The dot3ExtPkgQueueTable defines the objects which are per logical
   link, and per queue, used for the configuration and status indication
   of the ONU queues reported in the MPCP REPORT message, of EPON
   compliant interfaces.

   The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable defines the objects which are per
   logical link, per queue, and per queue_set, used for the
   configuration and status indication of the ONU queue_sets reported in
   the MPCP REPORT message, of EPON compliant interfaces.

   The dot3ExtPkgOptIfTable defines the objects which are per logical
   link, used for the control and status indication of the optical
   interface of EPON compliant interfaces.


   As described in the architecture section, each row in the tables is
   indexed according to the ifIndex, and specifically there is a row for
   each virtual link.  There are a few control objects which are shared
   and have the same value for the virtual interfaces (and they should
   have the same value for each ifIndex) but most of the objects have
   different values for N+1 logical interfaces at the OLT.  This is done
   for each MIB group.  It is a bit different from the [802.3ah]
   layering diagram which presents the P2MP layer as a single layer
   while duplicating the MAC and MAC client layers.  However from
   management perspective it is more convenient and neat to partition
   the management of the layers for the virtual links, as the atomic
   managed entity is the virtual link.  It is also convenient to use the
   interface index of the virtual link for that purpose, as it is
   already used to index the rows of the virtual links at the Interface,
   MAU and etherLike interfaces MIBs.

   OLT with 3 registered ONUs:

   which is the OLT MAC address.

   The creation of the rows of the OLT interface and the broadcast
   virtual interface is done at initialization.

   The creation of rows of the virtual interfaces at the OLT is done
   when the link is established (ONU registers) and the deletion is done
   when the link is deleted (ONU deregisters).

   For example, provided below are the values of the MPCP control table
   of the OLT after initialization, before the ONUs register.

     The table below presents the MPCP control table of the OLT after
    initialization.  A single row exists in this table associated with
                        the virtual broadcast link.

3.  Relation to other MIB Modules

3.1.  Relation to the Interfaces MIB and Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB

   EPON interface is a kind of Ether-like interface.  This MIB module
   extends the objects of the Interface MIB and the Ether-like
   interfaces MIB for an EPON type interface.

   Implementing this module therefore MUST require implementation of the
   Interfaces MIB module [RFC2863] and the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB
   module [RFC3635].

   Thus, each managed EPON interface would have a corresponding entry in
   the mandatory tables of the Ether-like MIB module found in [RFC3635],
   and likewise in the tables of the Interface MIB module found in
   [RFC2863].  Also each managed virtual EPON interface would have a
   corresponding entry in the mandatory tables of the Ether-like MIB
   module found in [RFC3635], and likewise in the tables of the
   Interface MIB module found in [RFC2863] with a dedicated ifIndex for
   this interface.

   In this document there is no replication of the objects from these
   MIBs, so for instance the document is defining
   dot3MpcpRemoteMACAddress only while assuming the local MAC address
   object is already defined in [RFC3635].

   The interface MIB module [RFC2863] defines the interface index
   (ifIndex).  Interface Index, as specified in [RFC2863] is used in
   this MIB Module as an index to the EPON MIB tables.  The ifIndex is
   used to denote the physical interface and the virtual link interfaces
   at the OLT.  The OLT interface and the virtual link interfaces are
   stacked using the ifStack table defined in [RFC2863], and the
   ifInvStack defined in [RFC2864].  The OLT interface is the lower
   layer of all other interfaces associated with the virtual links.

   This document defines the specific EPON objects of an ONU interface
   and an OLT interface.  Information in the tables is per LLID.  The
   rows in the EPON MIB tables, referring to the LLIDs are denoted with
   the corresponding ifIndexes of the virtual link interfaces.

   Please note that each virtual interface does not have a different
   physical MAC address at the OLT as the physical interface is the
   same.  It is specified in the [802.3ah] section 64.1.2.  The
   corresponding object of the Ether-like interface MIB is duplicated
   for all the virtual interfaces.


   For example the values of the Interface MIB objects are presented in

                                  Table 8

   OLT_MAC_Address is the MAC address of the OLT EPON interface.

   The following values will be set in the ifStack and ifInvStack tables
   related to this example:

   ifStackTable:

   ifStackHigherLayer=265535, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the OLT
   physical interface and its broadcast virtual interface

   ifStackHigherLayer=200001, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the OLT
   physical interface and its virtual interface of the 1st ONU

   ifStackHigherLayer=200002, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the OLT
   physical interface and its virtual interface of the 2nd ONU

   ifStackHigherLayer=200003, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the OLT
   physical interface and its virtual interface of the 3rd ONU

   ifInvStackTable:

   ifStackLowerLayer=2, ifStackHigherLayer=265535, - map between the
   broadcast interface of the OLT and the OLT physical interface

   ifStackLowerLayer=2, ifStackHigherLayer=200001 - map between the OLT
   virtual interface of the 1st ONU and the OLT physical interface

   ifStackLowerLayer=2, ifStackHigherLayer=200002 - map between the OLT
   virtual interface of the 2nd ONU and the OLT physical interface

   ifStackLowerLayer=2, ifStackHigherLayer=200003 - map between the OLT
   virtual interface of the 3rd ONU and the OLT physical interface


   The rows for the ONU interface, for the OLT interface and for the OLT
   broadcast interface are created in initialization.

   The creation of a row for a virtual link is done when the virtual
   link is established (ONU registers) and deletion is done when the

   virtual link is deleted (ONU deregisters).


   The EPON MIB module also extends the Interface MIB module with a set
   of counters, which are specific for the EPON interface.  The EPON MIB
   module implements the same handling of the counters when the
   operation of the interface starts or stops.  The interface MIB
   document describes the possible behavior of counters when an
   interface is re-initialized using the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime
   indicator, indicating the discontinuity of the counters.  Please see
   [RFC2863] section 3.1.5 p.11 for more information.  The counters of
   the EPON MIB should be handled in a similar manner.

3.2.  Relation to the IEEE 802.3 MAU MIBs

   The MAU types of the EPON Interface are defined in the amended MAU
   MIB document.  This document assumes the implementation of the MAU
   MIB for this purpose and does not repeat the EPON MAU types.
   Therefore implementing this module MUST require implementation of the
   MAU-MIB module [RFC3636bis-03].

   The handling of the ifMAU tables for the EPON case is similar to the
   handling described in the former section for the Interface and Ether-
   like interface MIBs.  A single row exists for the ONU in the
   ifMauTable.  A row for each virtual link (N+1 rows) exists at the
   OLT, with a separate value of ifMauIfIndex for each virtual link.

   As specified above the rows for the ONU interface, for the OLT
   interface and for the OLT broadcast interface are created in
   initialization.

   The creation of a row for a virtual link is done when the virtual
   link is established (ONU registers) and deletion is done when the
   virtual link is deleted (ONU deregisters).

3.3.  Relation to the EFM OAM MIB

   The EPON interfaces are aimed to the optical access networks and most
   probably will be accompanied with the implementation of the OAM
   section of the [802.3ah].  Therefore the EFM OAM MIB module
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-mib] MAY be implemented, when this MIB module is
   implemented, defining managed objects for the OAM layer that are
   complementary to the EFM EPON MIB module.  As the OAM is defined for
   a point to point link it is implemented in this case, using the
   virtual links which are defined for the P2MP network, so that an
   instance is held for each Logical link (LLID) of the EPON.  The
   corresponding ifIndex of the virtual link is used as the ifIndex of
   the tables of the OAM MIB module, for this purpose.

3.4.  Relation to the bridge MIB

   It is very probable that an EPON OLT will implement a bridging
   functionality above the EPON interface layer, bridging between the
   EPON users and the network.  Bridge functionality is specified at
   [802.1d].  In this scenario the virtual ports of the EPON are
   corresponding to the virtual bridge ports.  There is a direct mapping
   between the bridge ports and the LLIDs, which are virtual EPON
   channels.

   Therefore the bridge MIB modules [RFC4188], [RFC1525] MAY be
   implemented when the EFM EPON MIB module is implemented for an EPON
   OLT, defining managed objects for the bridge layer.

   The values of dot1dBasePortIfIndex would correspond to the ifIndex of
   the virtual port (1 for LLID1, 2 for LLID2,...)

   The broadcast virtual EPON interface of the OLT has no direct mapping
   to a virtual bridge port as it is not port specific but used for
   broadcast traffic.

                The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each
                uplink transmission queue.
                The number of queue sets defines the number of the
                reported sets, as would be explained in the description
                of the dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table. For each set the
                report bitmap defines which queue is present in the
                report, meaning that although the MPCP REPORT message
                can report of up to 8 queues in a REPORT message, the
                actual number is flexible. The Queue table has a
                variable size which is limited by the
                dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues object as an
                ONU can have fewer queues to report.
                The entries in the table are control and status
                indication objects for managing the queues of an EPON
                interface which are gathered in an extended package as
                an addition to the objects which are based on the
                [802.3ah] attributes.
                Each object has a row for every virtual link and for
                every queue in the report.
                Typically the number of expected virtual links in a PON
                is like the number of ONUs, which is 32-64, plus an
                additional entry for broadcast LLID (with a value of
                0xffff).
                In the [802.3ah] the LLID is a 2bytes register and the
                number of LLIDs is limited by that.
                The number of queues is between 0 and 7 and limited by
                dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues."

                The [802.3ah] MPCP defines a report of the occupancy of
                the transmit queues for the feedback BW request from the
                ONUs. These queues serve the uplink transmission of the
                ONU and data is gathered there until the ONU is granted
                for transmission.
                The management table of the queues is added here mainly
                to gather some statistics of their operation. This table
                is not duplicating existing management object of

                queues and the existence of the transmit queuing

                As can be seen from the message format, the ONU device
                reports of the status of up to 8 queues and it can
                report in a single MPCP REPORT message of a few sets
                of queues.
                The number of queue_sets defines the number of the
                reported sets, and it can reach up to a value of 8. It
                means that a device can hold a variable number of sets
                between 0 to 7.
                The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table has a variable
                queue_set size which is limited by the
                dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumThreshold object as an
                ONU can have fewer queue_sets to report.
                The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each
                uplink transmission queue. The queue_sets can be used to
                report the occupancy of the queues in a few levels as to
                allow granting, in an accurate manner, of only part of
                the data available in the queues. A Threshold is
                defined for each queue_set to define the level of the
                queue which is counted for the report of the occupancy.
                The threshold is reflected in the queue_set table by the
                dot3ExtPkgObjectReportThreshold object.

                For each queue set, the report bitmap defines which
                queues are present in the report, meaning that
                although the MPCP REPORT message can report of up to 8
                queues in a REPORT message, the actual number is
                flexible.
                The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table has a variable queue

                can have fewer queues to report.
                Each object has a row for every virtual link, for each
                queue in the report and for each queue_set in the queue.
                Typically the number of expected virtual links in a PON
                is like the number of ONUs, which is 32-64, plus an

                0xffff).
                In the [802.3ah] the LLID is a 2bytes register and the
                number of LLIDs is limited by that.
                The number of queues is between 0 and 7 and limited by

                Each object has a row for every virtual link denoted by
                the corresponding ifIndex.
                Typically the number of expected virtual links in a PON
                is like the number of ONUs, which is 32-64, plus an
                additional entry for broadcast LLID (with a value of
                0xffff).
                In the [802.3ah] the LLID is a 2bytes register and the
                number of LLIDs is limited by that.
                Although the optical interface is a physical interface,
                there is a row in the table for each virtual interface.
                The reason for having a separate row for each virtual
                link is that the OLT has a separate link for each one of
                the ONUs. For instance, they could be in different
                distances with different link budgets and different
                receive powers, therefore having different power alarms.
                It is quite similar to a case of different physical

6.  IANA Considerations

   The DOT3 EPON MIB module requires the allocation of a single object
   identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY under the MIB-2 tree.

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:




         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         dot3EponMIB        { mib-2 XXX }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Writing to
   these objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network
   operation: Including:

   Changing dot3MpcpAdminState state (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3EponFecMode mode (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReset mode (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectFecEnabled mode (Writing can be done at any
   time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectPowerDown (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReportNumThreshold (Writing can be done at
   any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReportThreshold (Writing can be done at any
   time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectRegisterAction (Writing can be done at any
   time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgRMadlEntryStatus (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfLowerInputPowerThreshold (Writing can be done
   at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfUpperInputPowerThreshold (Writing can be done
   at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfLowerOutputPowerThreshold (Writing can be
   done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfUpperOutputPowerThreshold (Writing can be
   done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfTransmitEnable (Writing can be done at any
   time)


   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control
   even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
   encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
