                   BMP Extension for Path Marking TLV
                draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv-03

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
   BGP Path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP
   Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension
   to BMP to convey the status of a BGP path after being processed by
   the BGP best-path selection algorithm.  This extension makes use of
   the TLV mechanims described in draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and draft-lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit
   [I-D.lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].

1.  Introduction

   For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
   the "best-path", "back-up path" and so on, may co-exist in the BGP
   RIB after being processed by the local policy and the BGP decision
   process.  The path status information is currently not carried in the
   BGP Update Message RFC4271 [RFC4271] or in the BMP Update Message
   RFC7854 [RFC7854].

   External systems can use the path status for various applications.
   The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
   troubleshooting.  Having such status stored in a centralized system
   can enable the development of tools facilitating this process.
   Optimisation systems can include the path status in their process,
   and also use the status as a validation source (since it can compare
   the calculated state to the actual outcome of the network, such as
   primary and backup path).  As a final example, path status

   information can complement other centralized sources of data, for
   example, flow collectors.

   This document defines a so-called Path Marking TLV to convey the BGP
   path status information to the BMP server.  The BMP Path Marking is
   defined to be prepended in the BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message.

2.  Prefix Information TLV for the RM Message

   As per RFC7854 [RFC7854], the BMP RM Message consists of the Common
   Header, Per-Peer Header, and the BGP Update PDU.  According to draft-
   grow-bmp-tlv [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] , optional trailing data in TLV
   format is allowed in the BMP RM Message to convey characteristics of
   transported NLRIs (i.e. to help stateless parsing) or vendor-specific
   data.  Such TLV types are to be defined for each application.

   This document defines the Prefix Information TLV to convey
   descriptional information for route prefixes.  The format is shown
   below.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   o  Type = TBD1 (2 Octets): Prefix Information TLV.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Prefix Information TLV.

   o  Count (2 Octets): indicates the number of sub TLVs followed in the
      Prefix Information Value field.

   o  Prefix information value (Variable): indicates the value of the
      Prefix Informtion TLV, which consists of one or multiple sub TLVs.

3.  Path Marking sub-TLV

   As stated in Appendix F.1 of RFC4271 [RFC4271], multiple address
   prefixes with the same path attributes are allowed to be specified in
   one message.  However, such multiple prefixes may have different
   prefix information, e.g., path status.  Thus, to indicate the path

   status for each BGP prefix, we define the Path Marking sub-TLV.  The
   order of the Path Marking sub-TLVs MUST be in accordance with the
   prefix order of the Update PDU.

   The E-bit [I-D.lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit] mechanism allows the usage
   of vendor-specific TLVs in addition to IANA-registered one.  In this
   document, both encoding options for the Path Marking sub-TLV are
   described.

   o  E bit: For an IANA-registered sub-TLV, the E bit MUST be set to 0.

   o  Type = TBD2 (15 Bits): Path Marking sub-TLV.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Path Marking TLV.  The value field further consists of the Path-
      Status field and Reason Code field.

   o  Path Status (4 Octets): indicates the path status of the BGP
      Update PDU encapsulated in the RM Message.  Currently 9 types of
      path status are defined, as shown in Table 1.

   o  Reason Code (4 Octets): indicates the reasons/explanations of the
      path status indicated in the Path Type field.  The detailed Reason
      Code bitmap remains to be defined.

                    Table 1: IANA-Registered Path Type

   The Path Status field contains a bitmap where each bit encodes a
   specific role of the path.  Multiple bits may be set when multiple
   path status apply to a path.

   o  The best-path is defined in RFC4271 [RFC4271] and the best-
      external path is defined in draft-ietf-idr-best-external
      [I-D.ietf-idr-best-external].

   o  An invalid path is a route that does not enter the BGP decision
      process.

   o  A non-selected path is a route that is not selected in the BGP
      decision process.  Back-up routes are considered non-selected,
      while the best and ECMP routes are not considered as non-selected.

   o  A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path whose nexthop
      resolution ends with an adjacency draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic
      [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A prefix can have more than one primary
      path if multipath is configured draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-
      considerations [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations].  A best-
      path is also considered as a primary path.

   o  A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it is not used
      until some or all primary paths become unreachable.  Backup paths
      are used for fast convergence in the event of failures.

   o  A non-installed path refers to the route that is not installed
      into the IP routing table.

   o  For the advertisement of multiple paths for the same address
      prefix without the new paths implicitly replacing any previous
      ones, the add-path status is applied RFC7911 [RFC7911].

      to 1.

   o  Type = 1 (15 Bits): indicates that it's the Enterprise-specific
      Path Marking sub-TLV.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Path Marking TLV.  The value field further consists of the Path-
      Status field and Reason Code field.

   o  PEN Number (4 octets): indicates the IANA enterprise number IANA-
      PEN.

   o  Path Status (4 Octets): indicates enterprise-specific path status,
      which remains to be defined.

   o  Reason Code (Variable): indicates the reasons/explanations of the
      path status indicated in the Path Type field.  The detailed Reason
      Code string is to be defined.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign the following new parameters
   to the BMP parameters name space.

   Type = TBD1 (2 Octets): Prefix Information TLV.

   Type = TBD2 (15 Bits): Path Marking sub-TLV.
