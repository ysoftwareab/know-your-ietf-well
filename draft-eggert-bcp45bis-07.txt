Abstract

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology

   mailing lists exists.  As this is the most general IETF mailing list,
   considerable latitude is allowed, but there are posts and topics that
   are unsuitable for this mailing list.

   This document obsoletes RFC3005.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF discussion list [IETF-DISCUSS] furthers the development and
   specification of Internet technology through the general discussion
   of topics for which no dedicated mailing lists exists.  As this is
   the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed.
   However, there are posts and topics that are unsuitable for this
   mailing list.  This document defines the charter for the IETF
   discussion list and explains its scope.

Internet-Draft        IETF Discussion List Charter         December 2021


   The IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL] applies to discussions on the IETF
   discussion list and all other IETF mailing lists, and requires
   conformance with the IETF Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the
   Anti-Harassment Policy [RFC7776], among others.

   This document obsoletes [RFC3005], documenting the use of other
   mailing lists for discussions that used to be in scope for the IETF
   discussion list, referring to applicable policies such as the
   Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the Anti-Harassment Policy
   [RFC7776], and clarifying moderation procedures.

2.  Charter for the IETF Discussion List

   The IETF discussion list is meant for discussions for which a more
   appropriate list does not exist, such as discussions that do not fall
   within the scope of any working group, area, or other established
   list.  When discussions are started on the IETF discussion list for
   which such a venue does exist, they should be continued at that other
   venue as soon as this is pointed out.

   When no dedicated mailing list exists, it may be preferable to
   request the creation of one [NON-WG-LISTS] and announce the
   availability of the new list on the IETF discussion list and on other
   related lists, such as area lists.

   Appropriate postings to the IETF discussion list include:

   *  Initial discussion of technical issues that are candidates for
      IETF work, but have not yet identified appropriate mailing lists.

   *  Questions and clarifications concerning practical aspects of IETF
      meetings, although most of these topics are better brought up on
      the discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS] or the attendee discussion list for a given IETF
      meeting.

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or the IETF,
      although the IETF announcement list [IETF-ANNOUNCE] is the
      preferred list for these.

   *  Discussions of IETF direction, policy, and the standards process
      in general, when a more suitable list (such as the discussion list
      for IETF LLC administrative issues [ADMIN-DISCUSS], the IAB
      discussion list for architectural issues [ARCH-DISCUSS], a meeting
      attendees list, a process-oriented WG list, etc.) cannot be
      identified.

Internet-Draft        IETF Discussion List Charter         December 2021


   These topics used to be in scope for the IETF discussion list, but
   have since moved to dedicated lists:

   *  Last Call discussions of proposed document actions now take place
      on the IETF Last Calls mailing list [LAST-CALLS].

   *  Discussion of IETF administrative policies now take place on the
      discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS].

   Inappropriate postings include:

   *  Advertising and other unsolicited bulk e-mail

   *  Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical topics

   *  Uncivil commentary, regardless of the general subject, per the
      IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL]

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or the IETF.

3.  Moderation

   Moderators (previously known as the "sergeant-at-arms") for the IETF
   discussion list are appointed by the IETF Chair and are empowered to
   restrict posting by a person, or of a thread, when the content is
   inappropriate and represents a pattern of abuse.  They are encouraged
   to take into account the overall nature of the postings by an
   individual and whether particular postings are an aberration or
   typical.

   Moderation of the IETF discussion list, including the handling of any
   appeals, is to be guided by the IETF discussion list charter
   specified in Section 2, and the related guidance from Section 1 that
   applies to all mailing lists.  The moderators are intended to
   establish a self-moderation function on the community, by the
   community.  Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for
   moderator decisions (see below), the IETF Chair therefore should not
   appoint a moderator who is serving in such a role.  If a moderator is
   selected for the IESG or IAB, they will step down from the moderator
   team.

   Apart from appointing moderators, the IETF Chair should stay away
   from the day-to-day operation and management of the moderator team.
   This has been in practice for a while, and the moderator team has
   independently maintained definitions of abuse patterns [MOD-UPC] and

   operating procedures [MOD-SOP] for them.  The moderator team should
   reach out to the IETF Chair for any conflict resolution in a timely
   manner.

   Because a moderator serves at the discretion of the IETF Chair - even
   if the IETF Chair is not otherwise involved in the operation of the
   moderator team - any moderator decision can be appealed to the IETF
   Chair, per [RFC2026].  Decisions by the IETF Chair can be appealed to
   the IESG as whole, again per [RFC2026].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise any security issues.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.
