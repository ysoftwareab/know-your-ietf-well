Abstract

   This Internet Draft describes an enhanced format for encoding prefix
   information, to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different
   paths to be announced and withdrawn.

   Prefix instances using the new format include both unique
   identifiers, and ordinals to control path selection.

   Withdrawal of prefixes requires a slight modification to disambiguate
   prefix instances.

Internet-Draft       BGP Additional Paths - Ordered            July 2008


1.  Background

   Even when all the best current practises are observed, operational
   problems may be experienced when running a BGP network.

   These include slow convergence due to "path-hunting" and persistant
   oscillations [1].

   Standardization of MRAI timers helps path-hunting, and oscillations
   can be worked around with RFC 5004 [3].

   However, both of these RFCs identify the above issues as needing
   further work.

1.1.  The Best Path Chaining and the Best Path Tree

   In a stable system of BGP speakers, for every given prefix, the
   selected best paths should form a spanning tree.  At each node, the
   best path selected points further up the tree.  The root of the tree
   is the destination, i.e. the originator of the prefix.  The path from
   any leaf to the root forms a "chain" of best paths.

   There are any number of ways that path attributes may be modified
   over time, at arbitrary places in this tree.  When this happens,
   individual segments of the tree may conceptually "stretch" or
   "shrink".  These changes may have no effect on the overall set of
   choices of best path, or they may cause a cascade effect "below" that
   point in the tree, with nodes migrating to new locations in a new
   version of the tree.

   However, each node makes its choice of best path locally, and every
   time a node changes its selection of best path, that change is
   visible to its peers, and may in turn affect their own choice of best
   path.  This propogation of changes is not instantaneous, and owing to
   the non-tree-like nature of the actual connectivity between nodes,
   can and does result in race conditions.

   Depending on connectivity, peering policy, and initial conditions,
   the behavior may border on that of systems best describe through
   chaos theory.  The time to reach a stable state, while generally
   bounded, is often far from fast, not necessarily predictable, and not
   necessarily consistent.

1.2.  The Withdrawal Problem

   Under normal circumstances, a change in attributes for a prefix will
   "flow" along the tree of best paths, without disrupting the structure
   of the tree itself signficantly.  Even when a node selects a new best



Dickson                 Expires January 14, 2009                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       BGP Additional Paths - Ordered            July 2008


   path (and thus re-attaches itself to the tree in a new location), it
   typically will continue to pass the new attributes along the branch
   of the tree for which it is the root.

   However, under certain circumstances, its choice of new best path,
   requires it to WITHDRAW the prefix from those peers, and effectively
   sever the branch.  It is in the after-effects of this truncation that
   much of the path-hunting behavior gets triggered.

   When a withdrawal effectively severs a branch of the tree, all the
   nodes on the tree will need to find new paths to the root.  The
   problem is, that it takes some time for them to learn this fact.

   In the mean time, the nodes in the severed branch may continue to
   use, and propogate, paths that are technically infeasible.

   The idea is to fast-track the flooding of the infeasibility of paths
   throughout all parts of the tree below a given link, so as to
   minimize the use of infeasible paths.

1.3.  The Uniqueness Property

   Currently, for each prefix, only one path for that prefix is ever
   announced from one peer to another (ignoring Route Reflectors).
   Because of this property, uniqueness, a withdrawal on a prefix does
   not require path information.  This also means that a change of best
   path is accomplished via an update for a prefix with the new path
   information.

   If, however, more than one path for a given prefix were sent, then
   any attempt to withdraw a prefix+path would require some mechanism to
   distinguish between prefix instances.

   In an environment where multiple path announcments per prefix are
   possible, but only one "best" path per prefix is maintained, then two
   steps would be involved in changing the "best" path.  In no
   particular order, that would be the withdrawal of the old prefix+
   path, and the announcement of the new prefix+path.


2.  Proposed Changes

   What is being proposed is, maintaining the "best N" for each prefix,
   and sending all of these rather than just the "best" path.

   The supposition is that pruning all infeasible branches, while
   maintaining information on the next N best paths, allows for fast
   removal of all (possibly best) paths which are dependent on

Internet-Draft       BGP Additional Paths - Ordered            July 2008


   infeasible paths, and fast reconvergence with pre-computed alternate
   paths.  It is expected that the N-best mechanism should act as a
   stop-gap until, but not actually replace, full BGP path selection to
   generate a new set of "best N" paths.

2.1.  How to Identify a Path

   As defined in [RFC4271], a path refers to the information reported in
   the path attribute field of an UPDATE message.  As the procedures
   specified in [RFC4271] allow only the advertisement of one path for a
   particular address prefix, a path for an address prefix from a BGP
   peer can be keyed on the address prefix.

   In order for a BGP speaker to advertise multiple paths for the same
   address prefix, a new identifier (termed "Path Identifier" hereafter)
   needs to be introduced so that a particular path for an address
   prefix can be identified by the combination of the address prefix and
   the Path Identifier.

   Depending on the application and the configuration of a particular
   peer, the Path Identifier for a path can be an AS number, or a BGP
   Identifier, or an opaque number, with which a path is associated by
   the BGP speaker that advertises the path.

2.2.  Extended NLRI Encodings

   In order to carry the Path Identifier in an UPDATE message, the
   existing NLRI encodings specified in [RFC4271, RFC2858] are extended
   as the following:


                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Path Identifier (4 octets)  |
                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Path Ordinal (1 octet)      |
                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Length (1 octet)            |
                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Prefix (variable)           |
                  +-----------------------------+

                                 Figure 1

   and the NLRI encoding specified in [RFC3107] is extended as the
   following:

                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Path Ordinal (1 octet)      |
                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Length (1 octet)            |
                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Label (3 octets)            |
                  +-----------------------------+
                   .........................
                  +-----------------------------+
                  | Prefix (variable)           |
                  +-----------------------------+


                                 Figure 2

   Update messages are otherwise identical to existing format.  If BGP
   capability ADD_PATHS_ORDERED has been negotiated, every Update MUST
   have the New Update Format.  More than one instance of a given
   prefix, with distinct values of Path Attributes, MAY be sent between
   BGP speakers.

   At most N instances may be sent, where N is the value sent along with
   the ADD_PATHS_ORDERED capability.

   Two prefix paths are considered identical if they differ only in the
   value of the ordinal.  An Update which contains a path which differs
   from the previous path with that value of UNIQ (identifier), will
   result in the path information for the prefix and UNIQ being
   modified.

   The Ordinal must be non-zero, but the rules governing values of
   Ordinal(s) used are specific to RFCs which refer to this document.
   For example, BGP Equal-Cost Multipath may allow two paths with the
   same Ordinal to be used.  Similarly, BGP N-best Paths may require
   per-prefix Ordinals be unique.

2.3.  ADD_PATH_ORDERED Capability

   The ADD_PATH_ORDERED Capability is a new BGP capability [RFC2842].
   The Capability Code for this capability is specified in the IANA
   Considerations section of this document.  The Capability Length field
   of this capability is variable.  The Capability Value field consists
   of zero or more of the tuples <AFI, SAFI, MOV> as follows:

                  +------------------------------------------------+
                  | Address Family Identifier (2 octets)           |
                  +------------------------------------------------+
                  | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (1 octet) |
                  +------------------------------------------------+
                  | Maximum Ordinal Value (1 octet)                |
                  +------------------------------------------------+

                                 Figure 3

   The meaning and use of the fields are as follows:
   Address Family Identifier (AFI):  This field carries the identity of
      the Network Layer protocol for which the BGP speaker intends to
      advertise multiple paths.  Presently defined values for this field
      are specified in [IANA-AFI].
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI):  This field provides
      additional information about the type of the Network Layer
      Reachability Information carried in the attribute.  Presently
      defined values for this field are specified in [IANA-SAFI].
   Maximum Ordinal Value (MOV):  This field specifies the maximum value
      the speaker will send in the Ordinal field of any Update.  It does
      not mean that that the speaker will necessarily send any
      particular Ordinal value within that range, nor that more than one
      Ordinal value will be used.  The value is an unsigned 8-bit value
      greater than zero.
   When advertising the ADD_PATH_ORDERED Capability to a peer, a BGP
   speaker conveys to the peer that the speaker is capable of receiving
   multiple paths as well as the single path from the peer for address
   families that the speaker supports.  When a tuple <AFI, SAFI, MOV> is
   included in the capability, it indicates that the BGP speaker intends
   to advertise multiple paths for the <AFI, SAFI, MOV>.  If the ADD-
   PATH Capability is also received from the peer, the speaker would
   then follow the procedures for advertising multiple paths to the peer
   for the specified <AFI, SAFI, MOV>.


3.  Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations beyond those already present in
   BGP are introduced.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to assign a new code point for BGP Capabilities for
   ADD_PATH_ORDERED.
