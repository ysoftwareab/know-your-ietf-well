  A Framework for Automating Service and Network Management with YANG
            draft-ietf-opsawg-model-automation-framework-02

Abstract

   Data models for service and network management provides a
   programmatic approach for representing (virtual) services or networks
   and deriving (1) configuration information that will be communicated
   to network and service components that are used to build and deliver
   the service and (2) state information that will be monitored and
   tracked.  Indeed, data models can be used during various phases of
   the service and network management life cycle, such as service
   instantiation, service provisioning, optimization, monitoring,
   diagnostic, and assurance.  Also, data models are instrumental in the
   automation of network management.  They also provide closed-loop
   control for the sake of adaptive and deterministic service creation,
   delivery, and maintenance.

   This document describes an architecture for service and network
   management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling
   technologies.  This architecture is drawn from a network provider
   perspective irrespective of the origin of a data module; it can thus
   accommodate even modules that are developed outside the IETF.

   The document aims in particular to exemplify an approach that
   specifies the journey from technology-agnostic services to
   technology-specific actions.

1.  Introduction

   The service management system usually comprises service activation/
   provision and service operation.  Current service delivery
   procedures, from the processing of customer's requirements and order
   to service delivery and operation, typically assume the manipulation
   of data sequentially into multiple OSS/BSS applications that may be
   managed by different departments within the service provider's
   organization (e.g., billing factory, design factory, network
   operation center, etc.).  In addition, many of these applications
   have been developed in-house over the years and operating in a silo
   mode:

   o  The lack of standard data input/output (i.e., data model) also
      raises many challenges in system integration and often results in
      manual configuration tasks.

   o  Secondly, many current service fulfillment system might have a
      limited visibility on the network state and therefore have slow
      response to the network changes.

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) becomes crucial to address these
   challenges.  SDN techniques [RFC7149] are meant to automate the
   overall service delivery procedures and typically rely upon
   (standard) data models that are used to not only reflect service
   providers'savoir-faire but also to dynamically instantiate and
   enforce a set of (service-inferred) policies that best accommodate
   what has been (contractually) defined (and possibly negotiated) with
   the customer.  [RFC7149] provides a first tentative to rationalize



Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   that service provider's view on the SDN space by identifying concrete
   technical domains that need to be considered and for which solutions
   can be provided:

   o  Techniques for the dynamic discovery of topology, devices, and
      capabilities, along with relevant information and data models that
      are meant to precisely document such topology, devices, and their
      capabilities.

   o  Techniques for exposing network services [RFC8309] and their
      characteristics.

   o  Techniques used by service-derived dynamic resource allocation and
      policy enforcement schemes, so that networks can be programmed
      accordingly.

   o  Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
      efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
      service fulfillment and assurance perspective.

   Models are key for each of these technical items.  Service and
   network management automation is an important step to improve the
   agility of network operations.  Models are also important to ease
   integrating multi-vendor solutions.

   YANG ([RFC7950]) module developers have taken both top-down and
   bottom-up approaches to develop modules [RFC8199] and to establish a
   mapping between a network technology and customer requirements on the
   top or abstracting common construct from various network technologies
   on the bottom.  At the time of writing this document (2020), there
   are many data models including configuration and service models that
   have been specified or are being specified by the IETF.  They cover
   many of the networking protocols and techniques.  However, how these
   models work together to configure a device, manage a set of devices
   involved in a service, or even provide a service is something that is
   not currently documented either within the IETF or other SDOs (e.g.,
   MEF).

   This document describes an architectural framework for service and
   network management automation (Section 3) that takes advantage of
   YANG modeling technologies and investigates how different layer YANG
   data models interact with each other (e.g., service mapping, model
   composing) in the context of service delivery and fulfillment
   (Section 4).

   This framework is drawn from a network provider perspective
   irrespective of the origin of a data module; it can accommodate even
   modules that are developed outside the IETF.

   The document identifies a list of use cases to exemplify the proposed
   approach (Section 5), but it does not claim nor aim to be exhaustive.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8309][RFC8199] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  Network Operator

   o  Customer

   o  Service

   o  Data Model

   o  Service Model

   o  Network Element Module

   The document makes use of the following terms:

   Network Model:  Describes a network level abstraction (or a subset of
      aspects of a network infrastructure), including devices and their
      subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the link and
      network layers across multiple devices.  It can be used by a
      network operator to allocate the resource (e.g., tunnel resource,
      topology resource) for the service or schedule the resource to
      meet the service requirements defined in a Service Model.

   Device Model:  Refers to the Network Element YANG data module
      described in [RFC8199].  Device Model is also used to refer to
      model a function embedded in a device (e.g., NAT [RFC8512], ACL
      [RFC8519]).

3.  Architectural Concepts & Goals

3.1.  Data Models: Layering and Representation

   As described in [RFC8199], layering of modules allows for better
   reusability of lower-layer modules by higher-level modules while
   limiting duplication of features across layers.

   The data models can be classified into Service, Network, and Device
   Models.  Different Service Models may rely on the same set of Network
   and/or Device Models.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   Service Models traditionally follow top down approach and are mostly
   customer-facing YANG modules providing a common model construct for
   higher level network services (e.g., L3VPN), which can be mapped to
   network technology-specific modules at lower layers (e.g., tunnel,
   routing, QoS, security).  For example, the service level can be used
   to characterise the network service(s) to be ensured between service
   nodes (ingress/egress) such as the communication scope (pipe, hose,
   funnel, ...), the directionality, the traffic performance guarantees
   (one-way delay (OWD), one-way loss, ...), etc.

   Figure 1 depicts the example of a VoIP service provider that relies
   in the connectivity services offered by a network provider.  These
   connectivity services can be captured in a YANG Service Module that
   reflects the service attributes that are shown in Figure 2.  This
   example follows the IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile template
   defined in [RFC7297].

   Network Models are mainly network resource-facing modules and
   describe various aspects of a network infrastructure, including
   devices and their subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the
   link and network layers across multiple devices (e.g., network
   topology and traffic-engineering tunnel modules).

   Device (and function) Models usually follow a bottom-up approach and
   are mostly technology-specific modules used to realize a service
   (e.g., BGP, NAT).

   Each level maintains a view of the supported YANG modules provided by
   low-levels (see for example, Appendix A).

   Figure 3 illustrates the overall layering model.

3.2.  Automation of Service Delivery Procedures

   Service Models can be used by an operator to expose its services to
   its customers.  Exposing such models allows to automate the
   activation of service orders and thus the service delivery.  One or
   more monolithic Service Models can be used in the context of a
   composite service activation request (e.g., delivery of a caching
   infrastructure over a VPN).  Such modules are used to feed a
   decision-making intelligence to adequately accommodate customer's
   needs.



Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   Such modules may also be used jointly with services that require
   dynamic invocation.  An example is provided by the service modules
   defined by the DOTS WG to dynamically trigger requests to handle DDoS
   attacks [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel][I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel].

   Network Models can be derived from Service Models and used to
   provision, monitor, instantiate the service, and provide lifecycle
   management of network resources (e.g., expose network resources to
   customers or operators to provide service fulfillment and assurance
   and allow customers or operators to dynamically adjust the network
   resources based on service requirements as described in Service
   Models (e.g., Figure 2) and the current network performance
   information described in the telemetry modules).

3.3.  Service Fullfillment Automation

   To operate a service, Device Models derived from Service Models or
   Network Models can be used to provision each involved network
   function/device with the proper configuration information, and
   operate the network based on service requirements as described in the
   Service Model(s) and local operational guidelines.

   In addition, the operational state including configuration that is in
   effect together with statistics should be exposed to upper layers to
   provide better network visibility (and assess to what extent the
   derived low level modules are consistent with the upper level
   inputs).  Filters are enforced on the notifications that are
   communicated to Service layers.  The type of notifications may be
   agreed in the Service Model.

   Note that it is important to correlate telemetry data with
   configuration data to be used for closed loops at the different
   stages of service delivery, from resource allocation to service
   operation, in particular.

3.4.  YANG Modules Integration

   To support top-down service delivery, YANG modules at different
   levels or at the same level need to be integrated together for proper
   service delivery (including, proper network setup).  For example, the
   service parameters captured in Service Models need to be decomposed
   into a set of (configuration/notification) parameters that may be
   specific to one or more technologies; these technology-specific
   parameters are grouped together to define technology-specific device
   level models or network level models.

   In addition, these technology-specific Device or Network Models can
   be further integrated with each other using the schema mount

   mechanism [RFC8528] to provision each involved network function/
   device or each involved administrative domain to support newly added
   module or features.  A collection of Device Models integrated
   together can be loaded and validated during the implementation time.

   High-level policies can be defined at Service or Network Models
   (e.g., AS Exclude in the example depicted in Figure 2).  Device
   Models will be tweaked accordingly to provide policy-based
   management.  Policies can also be used for telemetry automation,
   e.g., policies that contain conditions can trigger the generation and
   pushing of new telemetry data.

   Performance measurement telemetry can be used to provide service
   assurance at Service and/or Network levels.  Performance measurement
   telemetry model can tie with Service or Network Models to monitor
   network performance or Service Level Agreement.

            Figure 4: Service and Network Lifecycle Management

4.1.  Service Lifecycle Management Procedure

   Service lifecycle management includes end to end service lifecycle
   management at the service level and technology specific network
   lifecycle management at the network level.  The end-to-end service
   lifecycle management is technology independent service management and
   span across multiple administrative domain or multiple layers while
   technology specific service lifecycle management is technology domain
   specific or layer specific service lifecycle management.

4.1.1.  Service Exposure

   A service in the context of this document (sometimes called a Network
   Service) is some form of connectivity between customer sites and the




Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   Internet or between customer sites across the operator's network and
   across the Internet.

   Service exposure is used to capture services offered to customers
   (ordering and order handling).  One typical example is that a
   customer can use a L3SM service model to request L3VPN service by
   providing the abstract technical characterization of the intended
   service between customer sites.

   Service model catalogs can be created along to expose the various
   services and the information needed to invoke/order a given service.

4.1.2.  Service Creation/Modification

   A customer is (usually) unaware of the technology that the network
   operator has available to deliver the service, so the customer does
   not make requests specific to the underlying technology but is
   limited to making requests specific to the service that is to be
   delivered.  This service request can be issued using the service
   model.

   Upon receiving the service request, the service orchestrator/
   management system should first verify whether the service
   requirements in the service request can be met (i.e., whether there
   is sufficient resource that can be allocated).

   In successful case, the service orchestrator/management system maps
   such service request to its view.  This view can be described as a
   technology specific network model or a set of technology specific
   device models and this mapping may include a choice of which networks
   and technologies to use depending on which service features have been
   requested.

   In addition, a customer may require to change underlying network
   infrastructure to adapt to new customer's needs and service
   requirements.  This service modification can be issued in the same
   service model used by the service request.

4.1.3.  Service Optimization

   Service optimization is a technique that gets the configuration of
   the network updated due to network change, incident mitigation, or
   new service requirements.  One typical example is once the tunnel or
   the VPN is setup, Performance monitoring information or telemetry
   information per tunnel or per VPN can be collected and fed into the
   management system, if the network performance doesn't meet the
   service requirements, the management system can create new VPN




Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   policies capturing network service requirements and populate them
   into the network.

   Both network performance information and policies can be modelled
   using YANG.  With Policy-based management, self-configuration and
   self-optimization behavior can be specified and implemented.

4.1.4.  Service Diagnosis

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions for service diagnosis that allow operators to:

   o  monitor network communications (i.e., reachability verification
      and Continuity Check)

   o  troubleshoot failures (i.e., fault verification and localization)

   o  monitor service-level agreements and performance (i.e.,
      performance management)

   When the network is down, service diagnosis should be in place to
   pinpoint the problem and provide recommendation (or instructions) for
   the network recovery.

   The service diagnosis information can be modelled as technology-
   independent Remote Procedure Call (RPC) operations for OAM protocols
   and technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for OAM
   protocols [RFC8531][RFC8533].  These models can provide consistent
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms
   used to manage the network.

4.1.5.  Service Decommission

   Service decommission allow the customer to stop the service and
   remove the service from active status and release the network
   resource that is allocated to the service.  Customer can also use the
   service model to withdraw the registration to a service.

4.2.  Service Fullfillment Management Procedure

4.2.1.  Intended Configuration Provision

   Intended configuration at the device level is derived from network
   model at the network level or service model at the service level and
   represents the configuration that the system attempts to apply.  Take
   L3SM service model as an example, to deliver a L3VPN service, we need
   to map L3VPN service view defined in Service model into detailed




Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   intended configuration view defined by specific configuration models
   for network elements, configuration information includes:

   o  VRF definition, including VPN Policy expression

   o  Physical Interface

   o  IP layer (IPv4, IPv6)

   o  QoS features such as classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Routing protocols: support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in the document, as well as routing policies associated
      with those protocols.

   o  Multicast Support

   o  Address sharing

   o  Security function

   This specific configuration models can be used to configure Provider
   Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) devices within the site, e.g., a BGP
   policy model can be used to establish VPN membership between sites
   and VPN Service Topology.

4.2.2.  Configuration Validation

   Configuration validation is used to validate intended configuration
   and ensure the configuration take effect.  For example, a customer
   creates an interface "et-0/0/0" but the interface does not physically
   exist at this point, then configuration data appears in the
   <intended> status but does not appear in <operational> datastore.

4.2.3.  Performance Monitoring/Model-driven Telemetry

   When configuration is in effect in the device, <operational>
   datastore holds the complete operational state of the device
   including learned, system, default configuration and system state.
   However the configurations and state of a particular device does not
   have the visibility to the whole network or information of the flow
   packets are going to take through the entire network.  Therefore it
   becomes more difficult to operate the network without understanding
   the current status of the network.

   The management system should subscribe to updates of a YANG datastore
   in all the network devices for performance monitoring purpose and




Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   build full topological visibility to the network by aggregating and
   filtering these operational state from different sources.

4.2.4.  Fault Diagnostic

   When configuration is in effect in the device, some device may be
   mis-configured(e.g.,device links are not consistent on both sides of
   the network connection), network resources be mis-allocated and
   services may be negatively affected without knowing what is going on
   in the network.

   Technology-dependent nodes and RPC commands are defined in
   technology-specific YANG data models which can use and extend the
   base model described in Section 4.1.4 can be used to deal with these
   challenges.

   These RPC commands received in the technology dependent node can be
   used to trigger technology specific OAM message exchange for fault
   verification and fault isolation,e.g., TRILL Multicast Tree
   Verification (MTV) RPC command [I-D.ietf-trill-yang-oam] can be used
   to trigger Multi-Destination Tree Verification Message defined in
   [RFC7455] to verify TRILL distribution tree integrity.

4.3.  Multi-layer/Multi-domain Service Mapping

   Multi-layer/Multi-domain Service Mapping allow you map end to end
   abstract view of the service segmented at different layer or
   different administrative domain into domain specific view.  One
   example is to map service parameters in L3VPN service model into
   configuration parameters such as RD, RT, and VRF in L3VPN network
   model.  Another example is to map service parameters in L3VPN service
   model into TE tunnel parameter (e.g.,Tunnel ID) in TE model and VN
   parameters (e.g., AP list, VN member) in TEAS VN model
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang].

4.4.  Service Decomposing

   Service Decomposing allows to decompose service model at the service
   level or network model at the network level into a set of device/
   function models at the device level.  These device models may be tied
   to specific device type or classified into a collection of related
   YANG modules based on service type and feature offered and load at
   the implementation time before configuration is loaded and validated.

   In reference to Figure 5, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the L3VPN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in this document:

   1.  The Customer requests to create two sites (as per service
       creation operation in Section 4.2.1) relying upon a L3SM Service
       model with each having one network access connectivity:

          Site A: Network-Access A, Bandwidth=20M, for class "foo",
          guaranteed-bw-percent = 10, One-Way-Delay=70 msec

          Site B: Network-Access B, Bandwidth=30M, for class "foo1",
          guaranteed-bw-percent = 15, One-Way-Delay=60 msec

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   2.  The Orchestrator extracts the service parameters from the L3SM
       model.  Then, it uses them as input to translate ("service
       mapping operation" in Section 4.4) them into an orchestrated
       configuration of network elements (e.g., RD, RT, VRF) that are
       part of the L3NM network model.

   3.  The Controller takes orchestrated configuration parameters in the
       L3NM network model and translates them into orchestrated
       ("service decomposing operation" in ) configuration of network
       elements that are part of, e.g, BGP, QoS, Network Instance model,
       IP management, and interface models.

   [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology] is used for representing, managing
   and controlling the User Network Interface (UNI) topology.

   L3NM inherits some of data elements from the L3SM.  Likewise, the
   L3NM expose some information to the above layer such as the
   capabilities of an underlying network (which can be used to drive
   service order handling) or notifications (to notify subscribers about
   specific events or degradations as per agreed SLAs).

   In reference to Figure 6, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the VN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in this document:

   1.  Customer requests (service exposure operation in Section 4.1.1)
       to create 'VN' based on Access point, association between VN and
       Access point, VN member defined in the VN YANG module.

   2.  The orchestrator creates the single abstract node topology based
       on the information captured in an VN YANG module.

   3.  The Customer exchanges connectivity-matrix on abstract node and
       explicit path using TE topology model with the orchestrator.
       This information can be used to instantiate VN and setup tunnels
       between source and destination endpoints (service creation
       operation in Section 4.1.2).

   4.  The telemetry model which augments the TEAS VN model and
       corresponding TE Tunnel model can be used to subscribe to
       performance measurement data and notify all the parameter changes
       and network performance change related to VN topology or Tunnel
       [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics] and provide service
       assurance (service optimization operation in Section 4.1.3).

   and provide device self management within the network management
   automation architecture defined in this document:

   1.  To control which state a network device should be in or is
       allowed to be in at any given time, a set of conditions and
       actions are defined and correlated with network events (e.g.,
       allow the NETCONF server send updates only when the value exceeds
       a certain threshold for the first time but not again until the
       threshold is cleared), which constitute an event-driven policy or
       network control logic in the controller.

   2.  The controller pushes ECA policy to the network device and
       delegate network control logic to the network device.

   3.  The network device generates ECA script from ECA model and
       execute ECA script or network control logic based on Event.
       Event based notification or telemetry can be triggered if a
       certain condition is satisfied (model driven telemetry operation
       in Section 4.2.3).

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations specific to each of the technologies and
   protocols listed in the document are discussed in the specification
   documents of each of these techniques.

   (Potential) security considerations specific to this document are
   listed below:

   o  Create forwarding loops by mis-configuring the underlying network.

   o  Leak sensitive information: special care should be considered when
      translating between the various layers introduced in the document.

   o  Some Service Models may include a traffic isolation clause,
      appropriate technology-specific actions must be enforced to avoid
      that traffic is accessible to non-authorized parties.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA requests or assignments included in this document.

Appendix A.  Layered YANG Modules Examples Overview

   It is not the intent of this appendix to provide an inventory of
   tools and mechanisms used in specific network and service management
   domains; such inventory can be found in documents such as [RFC7276].

A.1.  Service Models: Definition and Samples

   As described in [RFC8309], the service is "some form of connectivity
   between customer sites and the Internet and/or between customer sites
   across the network operator's network and across the Internet".  More
   concretely, an IP connectivity service can be defined as the IP
   transfer capability characterized by a (Source Nets, Destination
   Nets, Guarantees, Scope) tuple where "Source Nets" is a group of
   unicast IP addresses, "Destination Nets" is a group of IP unicast
   and/or multicast addresses, and "Guarantees" reflects the guarantees
   (expressed in terms of Quality Of Service (QoS), performance, and
   availability, for example) to properly forward traffic to the said
   "Destination" [RFC7297].

   For example:

   o  The L3SM model [RFC8299] defines the L3VPN service ordered by a
      customer from a network operator.

   o  The L2SM model [RFC8466] defines the L2VPN service ordered by a
      customer from a network operator.

   o  The Virtual Network (VN) model [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang]
      provides a YANG data model applicable to any mode of VN operation.

A.2.  Network Models: Samples

   Figure 8 depicts a set of Network models such as topology models or
   tunnel models:

              Figure 8: Sample Resource Facing Network Models

   Topology YANG module Examples:

   o  Network Topology Models: [RFC8345] defines a base model for
      network topology and inventories.  Network topology data include
      link resource, node resource, and terminate-point resources.

   o  TE Topology Models: [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] defines a data
      model for representing and manipulating TE topologies.

      This module is extended from network topology model defined in
      [RFC8345] with TE topologies specifics.  This model contains
      technology-agnostic TE Topology building blocks that can be
      augmented and used by other technology-specific TE Topology
      models.

   o  L3 Topology Models

      [RFC8346] defines a data model for representing and manipulating
      Layer 3 topologies.  This model is extended from the network
      topology model defined in [RFC8345] with L3 topologies specifics.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


   o  L2 Topology Models

      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-l2-network-topology] defines a data model for
      representing and manipulating L2 topologies.  This model is
      extended from the network topology model defined in [RFC8345] with
      Layer 2 topologies specifics.

   Tunnel YANG module Examples:

   o  Tunnel identities to ease manipulating extensions to specific
      tunnels [RFC8675].

   o  TE Tunnel Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] defines a YANG module for the
      configuration and management of TE interfaces, tunnels, and LSPs.

   o  SR TE Tunnel Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for Segment Routing (SR) TE
      specific data.

   o  MPLS TE Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for MPLS TE configurations,
      state, RPC and notifications.

   o  RSVP-TE MPLS Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-rsvp-te] augments the RSVP-TE generic module
      with parameters to configure and manage signaling of MPLS RSVP-TE
      LSPs.

   Other Network Models:

   o  Path Computation API Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] YANG module for a stateless
      RPC which complements the stateful solution defined in
      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].

   o  OAM Models (including Fault Management (FM) and Performance
      Monitoring):

      [RFC8532] defines a base YANG module for the management of OAM
      protocols that use Connectionless Communications.  [RFC8533]



Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 29]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


      defines a retrieval method YANG module for connectionless OAM
      protocols.  [RFC8531] defines a base YANG module for connection
      oriented OAM protocols.  These three models are intended to
      provide consistent reporting, configuration, and representation
      for connection-less OAM and Connection oriented OAM separately.

      Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
      Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the
      network services or necessarily point to the root cause.  RFC8632
      defines a YANG module for alarm management.

   o  Generic Policy Model:

      The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based
      management framework [RFC8328] defines base YANG modules
      [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-data-model] to encode policy.  These
      models point to other device-, technology-, and service-specific
      YANG modules.  Policy rules within an operator's environment can
      be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide, policies to
      a network management function (within a controller, an
      orchestrator, or a network element).  The network management
      function can then control the configuration and/or monitoring of
      network elements and services.  This document describes the SUPA
      basic framework, its elements, and interfaces.

A.3.  Device Models: Samples

   Network Element models (Figure 9) are used to describe how a service
   can be implemented by activating and tweaking a set of functions
   (enabled in one or multiple devices, or hosted in cloud
   infrastructures) that are involved in the service delivery.  Figure 9
   uses IETF-defined models as an example.

                Figure 9: Network Element Modules Overview

A.3.1.  Model Composition

   o  Device Model

      [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-device-model] presents an approach for organizing
      YANG modules in a comprehensive logical structure that may be used
      to configure and operate network devices.  The structure is itself



Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 31]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


      represented as an example YANG module, with all of the related
      component models logically organized in a way that is
      operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be
      implemented.

   o  Logical Network Element Model

      [RFC8530] defines a logical network element module which can be
      used to manage the logical resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for logical resource partitioning are Logical Systems or Logical
      Routers.

   o  Network Instance Model

      [RFC8529] defines a network instance module.  This module can be
      used to manage the virtual resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for virtual resource partitioning are Virtual Routing and
      Forwarding (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs).

A.3.1.1.  Schema Mount

   Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design principles
   of the YANG data modeling language.  As a result, the same YANG
   module can be combined with various sets of other modules and thus
   form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
   specific use case.  [RFC8528] defines a mechanism, denoted schema
   mount, that allows for mounting one data model consisting of any
   number of YANG modules at a specified location of another (parent)
   schema.

   That capability does not cover design time.

A.3.2.  Device Models: Samples

   The following provides an overview of some device models that can be
   used within a network.  This list is not comprehensive.

   BGP:       [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] defines a YANG module for
              configuring and managing BGP, including protocol, policy,
              and operational aspects based on data center, carrier, and
              content provider operational requirements.

   MPLS:      [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang] defines a base model for MPLS
              which serves as a base framework for configuring and
              managing an MPLS switching subsystem.  It is expected that
              other MPLS technology YANG modules (e.g., MPLS LSP Static,



Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 32]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


              LDP or RSVP-TE models) will augment the MPLS base YANG
              module.

   QoS:       [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-qos-model] describes a YANG module of
              Differentiated Services for configuration and operations.

   ACL:       Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements
              used to configure device forwarding behavior.  It is used
              in many networking technologies such as Policy Based
              Routing, Firewalls, etc.  [RFC8519] describes a data model
              of ACL basic building blocks.

   NAT:       For the sake of network automation and the need for
              programming Network Address Translation (NAT) function in
              particular, a data model for configuring and managing the
              NAT is essential.  [RFC8512] defines a YANG module for the
              NAT function covering a variety of NAT flavors such as
              Network Address Translation from IPv4 to IPv4 (NAT44),
              Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients
              to IPv4 Servers (NAT64), customer-side translator (CLAT),
              Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT), Explicit Address
              Mappings (EAM) for SIIT, IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix
              Translation (NPTv6), and Destination NAT.  [RFC8513]
              specifies a DS-Lite YANG module.

   Stateless Address Sharing:  [RFC8676] specifies a YANG module for A+P
              address sharing, including Lightweight 4over6, Mapping of
              Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E), and Mapping
              of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T) softwire
              mechanisms.

   Multicast: [I-D.ietf-pim-yang] defines a YANG module that can be used
              to configure and manage Protocol Independent Multicast
              (PIM) devices.

              RFC8652 defines a YANG module that can be used to
              configure and manage Internet Group Management Protocol
              (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) devices.

              [I-D.ietf-pim-igmp-mld-snooping-yang] defines a YANG
              module that can be used to configure and manage Internet
              Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener
              Discovery (MLD) Snooping devices.

   EVPN:      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang] defines a YANG module for
              Ethernet VPN services.  The model is agnostic of the
              underlay.  It applies to MPLS as well as to VxLAN




Wu, et al.             Expires September 18, 2020              [Page 33]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation     March 2020


              encapsulation.  The module is also agnostic to the
              services, including E-LAN, E-LINE, and E-TREE services.

   L3VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l3vpn-yang] defines a YANG module that can
              be used to configure and manage BGP L3VPNs [RFC4364].  It
              contains VRF specific parameters as well as BGP specific
              parameters applicable for L3VPNs.

   L2VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] defines a YANG module for MPLS
              based Layer 2 VPN services (L2VPN) [RFC4664] and includes
              switching between the local attachment circuits.  The
              L2VPN model covers point-to-point VPWS and Multipoint VPLS
              services.  These services use signaling of Pseudowires
              across MPLS networks using LDP [RFC8077][RFC4762] or BGP
              [RFC4761].

   Routing Policy:  [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] defines a YANG module
              for configuring and managing routing policies based on
              operational practice.  The module provides a generic
              policy framework which can be augmented with protocol-
              specific policy configuration.

   BFD:       Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] is a
              network protocol which is used for liveness detection of
              arbitrary paths between systems.  [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang]
              defines a YANG module that can be used to configure and
              manage BFD.

   SR/SRv6:   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-yang] a YANG module for segment
              routing configuration and operation.


   Core Routing:  [RFC8349] defines the core routing data model, which
              is intended as a basis for future data model development
              covering more-sophisticated routing systems.  It is
              expected that other Routing technology YANG modules (e.g.,
              VRRP, RIP, ISIS, OSPF models) will augment the Core
              Routing base YANG module.

   PM:

              [I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp-yang] defines a data model for client
              and server implementations of the Two-Way Active
              Measurement Protocol (TWAMP).

              [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-yang] defines the data model for
              implementations of Session-Sender and Session-Reflector

              for Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
              mode using YANG.

              [RFC8194] defines a data model for Large-Scale Measurement
              Platforms (LMAPs).
