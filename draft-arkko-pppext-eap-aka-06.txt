Abstract 
    
   This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
   mechanism for authentication and session key distribution using the 
   Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Authentication and 
   Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism. AKA is based on symmetric keys, and 
   runs typically in a UMTS Subscriber Identity Module, a smart card 
   like device. AKA provides also backward compatibility to Global 
   System for Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication, making it 
   possible to use EAP AKA for authenticating both GSM and UMTS 
   subscribers. 
    
   EAP AKA includes optional identity privacy support and an optional 
   re-authentication procedure.

1. Introduction and Motivation 
    
   This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
   mechanism for authentication and session key distribution using the 
   UMTS AKA authentication mechanism [1].UMTS is a global third 
   generation mobile network standard.

                        EAP AKA Authentication           November 2002 
    
   AKA is based on challenge-response mechanisms and symmetric 
   cryptography. AKA typically runs in a UMTS Subscriber Identity 
   Module (USIM). AKA also provides backward compatibility to the GSM 
   authentication mechanism [2]. Compared to the GSM mechanism, UMTS 
   AKA provides substantially longer key lengths and mutual 
   authentication. 
    
   The introduction of AKA inside EAP allows several new applications. 
   These include the following: 
    
   - The use of the AKA also as a secure PPP authentication method in 
     devices that already contain an USIM. 
    
   - The use of the third generation mobile network authentication 
     infrastructure in the context of wireless LANs and IEEE 802.1x 
     technology through EAP over Wireless [3, 4]. 
    
   - Relying on AKA and the existing infrastructure in a seamless way 
     with any other technology that can use EAP. 
    
   AKA works in the following manner: 
    
   - The USIM and the home environment have agreed on a secret key 
     beforehand. 
    
   - The actual authentication process starts by having the home 
     environment produce an authentication vector, based on the secret 
     key and a sequence number. The authentication vector contains a 
     random part RAND, an authenticator part AUTN used for 
     authenticating the network to the USIM, an expected result part 
     XRES, a session key for integrity check IK, and a session key for 
     encryption CK. 
 
   - The RAND and the AUTN are delivered to the USIM. 
 
   - The USIM verifies the AUTN, again based on the secret key and the 
     sequence number. If this process is successful (the AUTN is valid 
     and the sequence number used to generate AUTN is within the 
     correct range), the USIM produces an authentication result, RES 
     and sends this to the home environment. 
 
   - The home environment verifies the correct result from the USIM. If 
     the result is correct, IK and CK can be used to protect further 
     communications between the USIM and the home environment. 
    
   When verifying AUTN, the USIM may detect that the sequence number 
   the network uses is not within the correct range. In this case, the 
   USIM calculates a sequence number synchronization parameter AUTS and 
   sends it to the network. AKA authentication may then be retried with 
   a new authentication vector generated using the synchronized 
   sequence number. 
    
   For a specification of the AKA mechanisms and how the cryptographic 
   values AUTN, RES, IK, CK and AUTS are calculated, see reference [1].

   It is also possible that the home environment delegates the actual 
   authentication task to an intermediate node. In this case the 
   authentication vector or parts of it are delivered to the 
   intermediate node, enabling it to perform the comparison between RES 
   and XRES, and possibly also use CK and IK. Such delivery MUST be 
   done in a secure manner. In EAP AKA, the EAP server node is such an 
   intermediate node. 
    
   In the third generation mobile networks, AKA is used both for radio 
   network authentication and IP multimedia service authentication 
   purposes. Different user identities and formats are used for these; 
   the radio network uses the International Mobile Subscriber 
   Identifier (IMSI), whereas the IP multimedia service uses the 
   Network Access Identifier (NAI) [5].

   The following terms will be used through this document: 
    
    
   AAA protocol 

      Authentication, Authorization and Accounting protocol 

   AAA server 

      The AAA server is responsible for storing shared secrets and 
      other credential information necessary for the authentication of 
      users. Cf. EAP server 

   AKA 

      Authentication and Key Agreement

      Authentication Centre. The mobile network element that can 
      authenticate subscribers either in GSM or in UMTS networks. 

   Authenticator 

      The entity that terminates the protocol carrying EAP used by the 
      client, such as a Network Access Server (NAS) terminating the PPP 
      link. The EAP server may be co-located in the Authenticator. In 
      this case, the Authenticator may actually authenticate the user 
      based on information received from the AAA server.

   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [7] 
 
3. Protocol Overview 
    
   In this document, the term EAP Server refers to the network element 
   that terminates the EAP protocol. Usually the EAP server is separate 
   from the authenticator device, which is the network element closest 
   to the client, such as a Network Access Server (NAS) or an IEEE 
   802.1X bridge. Alternatively, the EAP server functionality may be 
   co-located in the authenticator although typically, the EAP server 
   functionality is implemented on a separate AAA server with whom the 
   authenticator communicates using an AAA protocol. (The exact AAA 
   communications are outside the scope of this document, however.) 
    
   The message flow below shows the basic successful full 
   authentication case with the EAP AKA. The EAP AKA uses two 
   roundtrips to authorize the user and generate session keys. As in 
   other EAP schemes, first an identity request/response message pair 
   is exchanged. (As specified in [6], the initial identity request is 
   not required, and MAY be bypassed in cases where the authenticator 
   can presume the identity, such as when using leased lines, dedicated 
   dial-ups, etc. Please see also Section 4.2 for specification how to 
   obtain the identity via EAP AKA messages.)  
    
   Next, the EAP server starts the actual AKA protocol by sending an 
   EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message. EAP AKA packets encapsulate 
   parameters in attributes, encoded in a Type, Length, Value format. 
   The packet format and the use of attributes are specified in Section 
   6. The EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message contains a random number 
   (AT_RAND) and an authorization vector (AT_AUTN), and a message 
   authentication code AT_MAC. The EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message 
   MAY optionally contain encrypted data, which is used for IMSI 
   privacy support, as described in Section 4.3. The AT_MAC attribute 
   contains a message authentication code covering the EAP packet. The 
   encrypted data is not shown in the figures of this section. 
    
   The client runs the AKA algorithm (perhaps inside an USIM) and 
   verifies the AUTN. If this is successful, the client is talking to a 
   legitimate EAP server and proceeds to send the EAP-Response/AKA-
   Challenge. This message contains a result parameter that allows the 
   EAP server in turn to authenticate the client, and the AT_MAC 
   attribute to integrity protect the EAP message.

   The next message flow shows the client rejecting the AUTN of the EAP 
   server. This flow is not used in the GSM compatible mode. 
    
   The client sends an explicit error message (EAP-Response/AKA-
   Authentication-Reject) to the Authenticator, as usual in AKA when 
   AUTN is incorrect. This allows the EAP server to produce the same 
   error statistics as AKA in general produces in UMTS. Please note 
   that this behavior is different from other EAP/AKA error cases, such 
   as when encountering an incorrect AT_MAC attribute, the client 
   silently discards the EAP/AKA message.

   Networks that are not UMTS aware use the GSM compatible version of 
   this protocol even for UMTS subscribers. In this case, the AUTN 
   parameter is not included in the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge packet. 
   If a UMTS capable client does not want to accept the use of the GSM 
   compatible mode, the client can reject the authentication by 
   silently ignoring any EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge packets that do not 
   include the AUTN parameter. 
    
   The AKA uses shared secrets between the Client and the Client's home 
   operator together with a sequence number to actually perform an 
   authentication. In certain circumstances it is possible for the 
   sequence numbers to get out of sequence. Here's what happens then:

   After the resynchronization process has taken place in the server 
   and AAA side, the process continues by the server side sending a new 
   EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message. 
    
   In addition to the full authentication scenarios described above, 
   EAP AKA includes a re-authentication procedure, which is specified 
   in Section 5. 
    
4. Identity Management 
    
   This section specifies user identity management and identity privacy 
   support. 
    
4.1. User Identity in EAP-Response/Identity 
    
   In the beginning of an EAP authentication, the Authenticator issues 
   the EAP-Request/Identity packet to the client. The client responds 
   with EAP-Response/Identity, which contains the user's identity. The 
   formats of these packets are specified in [6].

                        EAP AKA Authentication           November 2002 
    
    
   UMTS and GSM subscribers are identified with the International 
   Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [8]. The IMSI is composed of a 
   three digit Mobile Country Code (MCC), a two or three digit Mobile 
   Network Code (MNC) and a not more than 10 digit Mobile Subscriber 
   Identification Number (MSIN). In other words, the IMSI is a string 
   of not more than 15 digits. MCC and MNC uniquely identify the 
   operator. 
    
   Internet AAA protocols identify users with the Network Access 
   Identifier (NAI) [5]. When used in a roaming environment, the NAI is 
   composed of a username and a realm, separated with "@" 
   (username@realm). The username portion identifies the subscriber 
   within the realm. The AAA nodes use the realm portion of the NAI to 
   route AAA requests to the correct AAA server. The realm name used in 
   this protocol MAY be chosen by the operator and it MAY be a 
   configurable parameter in the EAP/AKA client implementation. In this 
   case, the client is typically configured with the NAI realm of the 
   home operator. Operators MAY reserve a specific realm name for 
   EAP/AKA users. This convention makes it easy to recognize that the 
   NAI identifies a subscriber that uses EAP/AKA. Such a reserved NAI 
   realm may be a useful hint to the first authentication method to use 
   during method negotiation. 
    
   There are three types of NAI username portions in EAP/AKA: non-
   pseudonym permanent usernames that are based on the IMSI, pseudonym 
   usernames and re-authentication usernames. The first two are only 
   used on full authentication and the last one only on re-
   authentication. When the optional IMSI privacy support is not used, 
   the non-pseudonym permanent username is used. The non-pseudonym 
   permanent username is of the format "0imsi". In other words, the 
   first character of the username is the digit zero (ASCII value 
   0x30), followed by the IMSI. The IMSI is an ASCII string that 
   consists of not more than 15 decimal digits (ASCII values between 
   0x30 and 0x39) as specified in [8] 
    
   The EAP server MAY use the leading "0" as a hint to try EAP/AKA as 
   the first authentication method during method negotiation. The 
   EAP/AKA server MAY propose EAP/AKA even if the leading character was 
   not "0". 
    
   When the optional identity privacy support is used on full 
   authentication, the client MAY use the pseudonym received upon the 
   previous full authentication sequence as the username portion of the 
   NAI, as specified in Section 4.3. The client MUST NOT modify the 
   pseudonym received in AT_NEXT_PSEUDONYM. For example, the client 
   MUST NOT append any leading characters in the pseudonym. 
    
   On re-authentication, the client uses the re-authentication identity 
   received upon the previous authentication sequence as the NAI. A new 
   re-authentication identity may be delivered as part of both full 
   authentication and re-authentication. The client MUST NOT modify the 
   re-authentication identity received in AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID but the 
   client must use the re-authentication identity as it is. For

   example, the client MUST NOT append any leading characters in the 
   re-authentication identity. 
    
   If no configured realm name is available, the client MAY derive the 
   realm name from the MCC and MNC portions of the IMSI. In this case, 
   the realm name is obtained by concatenating "mnc", the MNC digits of 
   IMSI, ".mcc", the MCC digits of IMSI and ".owlan.org". For example, 
   if the IMSI is 123456789098765, and the MNC is three digits long, 
   then the derived realm name is "mnc456.mcc123.owlan.org". 
   If the client is not able to determine whether the MNC is two or 
   three digits long, the client MAY use a 3-digit MNC. If the correct 
   length of the MNC is two, then the MNC used in the realm name will 
   include the first digit of MSIN. Hence, when configuring AAA 
   networks for operators that have 2-digit MNCs, the network SHOULD 
   also be prepared for realm names with incorrect 3-digit MNCs. 
    
4.2. Obtaining Subscriber Identity via EAP AKA Messages 
    
   It may be useful to obtain the identity of the subscriber through 
   means other than EAP Request/Identity. This can eliminate the need 
   for an identity request when using EAP method negotiation. If this 
   was not possible then it might not be possible to negotiate EAP/AKA 
   as the second method since not all EAP implementations support 
   multiple EAP Identity requests.. 
    
   If the EAP server has not received any identity (IMSI, pseudonym or 
   re-authentication identity) from the client when sending the first 
   EAP/AKA request, then the EAP server may issue the EAP-Request/AKA-
   Identity packet and includes the AT_ANY_ID_REQ attribute (specified 
   in Section 8.5). This attribute does not contain any data. 
    
   The AT_ANY_ID_REQ attribute requests the client to include the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute (specified in Section 8.6) in the EAP-
   Response/AKA-Identity packet. The identity format in the AT_IDENTITY 
   attribute is the same as in the Type-Data field of the EAP-
   Response/Identity packet. The AT_IDENTITY attribute contains an 
   IMSI-based permanent identity, a pseudonym identity or a re-
   authentication identity. If the server does not support re-
   authentication, it uses the AT_FULLAUTH_ID_REQ attribute instead of 
   the AT_ANY_ID_REQ attribute to directly request for a full 
   authentication identity (either the permanent identity or a 
   pseudonym identity). If the server uses the AT_FULLAUTH_ID_REQ 
   attribute, the client MUST NOT use a re-authentication identity in 
   the AT_IDENTITY attribute. 
    
   The use of pseudonyms for anonymity is specified in Section 4.3. The 
   use of re-authentication identities is specified in Section 5. 
    
   The full authentication case is illustrated in the figure below. In 
   this case, AT_IDENTITY contains either the permanent identity or a 
   pseudonym identity. The same sequence is also used in case the 
   server uses the AT_FULLAUTH_ID_REQ in EAP-Request/AKA-Identity

   If the client wants to perform full authentication, it includes the 
   permanent identity or a pseudonym identity in the AT_IDENTITY 
   attribute. The client may use these identities in response to either 
   AT_ANY_ID_REQ or AT_FULLAUTH_ID_REQ. If the server uses the 
   AT_ANY_ID_REQ and the client wants to perform re-authentication, 
   then the client includes a re-authentication identity in the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute. 
    
   If the client uses its full authentication identity and the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute contains a valid permanent identity or a valid 
   pseudonym identity that the EAP server is able to decode to the 
   permanent identity, then the full authentication sequence proceeds 
   as usual with the EAP Server issuing the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge 
   message. 
    
   On re-authentication, if the AT_IDENTITY attribute contains a valid 
   re-authentication identity and the server agrees on using re-
   authentication, then the server proceeds with the re-authentication 
   sequence and issues the EAP-Request/AKA-Reauthentication packet, as 
   specified in Section 5. If the server does not recognize the re-
   authentication identity, then it issues a second EAP-Request/AKA-
   Identity message and includes the AT_FULLAUTH_ID_REQ attribute. In 
   this case, a second EAP/AKA-Identity round trip is required. The 
   messages used on the first roundtrip are ignored. This is 
   illustrated below.

   If the server recognizes the re-authentication identity, but still 
   wants to fall back on full authentication, the server may issue the 
   EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge packet. In this case, the full 
   authentication procedure proceeds as usual. 
    
   An extra EAP/AKA-Identity round trip is also required in cases when 
   the AT_IDENTITY attribute contains a pseudonym identity that the EAP 
   server fails to decode. The operation in this case is specified in 
   Section 4.3. 
    
4.3. Identity Privacy Support 
    
   EAP/AKA includes optional identity privacy (anonymity) support that 
   can be used to hide the cleartext IMSI and to make the subscriber's 
   connections unlinkable to eavesdroppers. Identity privacy is based 
   on temporary identities, or pseudonyms, which are equivalent to but 
   separate from the Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identities (TMSI) that 
   are used on cellular networks. Please see Section 13.1 for security 
   considerations concerning identity privacy.

   If identity privacy is not used or if the client does not have any 
   pseudonyms or re-authentication identities available, the client 
   transmits the permanent identity (based on IMSI) in the EAP-
   Response/Identity packet or in the AT_IDENTITY attribute. 
    
   The EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message MAY include an encrypted 
   pseudonym in the value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute. The 
   AT_IV and AT_MAC attributes are also used to transport the pseudonym 
   to the client, as described in Section 8.1. Because the identity 
   privacy support is optional to implement, the client MAY ignore the 
   AT_IV and AT_ENCR_DATA attributes and always transmit the IMSI-based 
   permanent identity in the EAP-Response/Identity packet and in the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute. 
    
   On receipt of the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge, the client verifies the 
   AT_MAC attribute before looking at the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute. If 
   the AT_MAC is invalid, then the client MUST silently discard the EAP 
   packet. If the AT_MAC attribute is valid, then the client MAY 
   decrypt the encrypted data in AT_ENCR_DATA and use the obtained 
   pseudonym on the next full authentication. 
    
   If the client does not receive a new pseudonym in the EAP-
   Request/AKA-Challenge message, the client MAY use an old pseudonym 
   instead of the permanent identity on next full authentication. 
    
   The EAP server produces pseudonyms in an implementation-dependent 
   manner. Only the EAP server needs to be able to map the pseudonym to 
   the permanent identity. Regardless of construction method, the 
   pseudonym MUST conform to the grammar specified for the username 
   portion of an NAI. The EAP AKA server MAY produce pseudonyms that 
   begin with a leading "0" character in order to be able to use the 
   leading character as a hint in EAP method negotiation during next 
   authentication. 
    
   The client MAY transmit the received pseudonym in the first EAP-
   Response/Identity packet of the next full authentication with the 
   EAP server. The client concatenates the received pseudonym with the 
   "@" character and the NAI realm portion. The client selects the 
   realm name portion similarly as it select the realm name portion 
   when using the permanent identity. If the EAP server successfully 
   decodes the pseudonym received in the EAP-Response/Identity packet 
   to a known client identity (IMSI), the authentication proceeds with 
   the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message as usual. 
    
   Because the client may fail to save a pseudonym sent to in an EAP-
   Request/AKA-Challenge, for example due to malfunction, the EAP 
   server SHOULD maintain at least one old pseudonym in addition to the 
   most recent pseudonym. 
    
   If the EAP server requests the client to include its identity in the 
   EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packet, as specified in Section 4.2, the 
   client MAY transmit the received pseudonym in the AT_IDENTITY 
   attribute. If the EAP server successfully decodes the pseudonym to a

   known identity, then the authentication proceeds with the EAP-
   Request/AKA-Challenge packet as usual. 
   If the EAP server fails to decode the pseudonym to a known identity, 
   then the EAP server requests the permanent identity (non-pseudonym 
   identity) by including the AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ attribute (Section 
   8.5) in the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message. 
    
   The EAP server issues the EAP-Request/AKA-Identity message also in 
   the case when it received the undecodable pseudonym in AT_IDENTITY 
   included in the EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packet. In this case, a 
   second EAP/AKA-Identity round trip is required. 
    
   A received AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ does not necessarily originate from 
   the valid network, but an active attacker may transmit an EAP-
   Request/AKA-Identity packet with an AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ attribute to 
   the client, in an effort to find out the true identity of the user. 
   On receipt of EAP-Request/AKA-Identity that includes 
   AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ, the client MAY delay the processing of the 
   message for a while in order to wait for another EAP AKA message 
   that does not include the AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ attribute. 
    
   Basically, there are two different policies that the client can 
   employ with regard to AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ. A "conservative" client 
   assumes that the network is able to maintain pseudonyms robustly. 
   Therefore, if a conservative client has a pseudonym, the client 
   silently ignores the EAP packet with AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ, because 
   the client believes that the valid network is able to decode the 
   pseudonym. (Alternatively, the conservative client may respond to 
   AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ in certain circumstances, for example if the 
   pseudonym was received a long time ago.) The benefit of this policy 
   is that it protects the client against active attacks on anonymity. 
   On the other hand, a "liberal" client always accepts the 
   AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ and responds with the IMSI-based permanent 
   identity. The benefit of this policy is that it works even if the 
   valid network sometimes loses pseudonyms and is not able to decode 
   them to the permanent identity. 
    
   The value field of the AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ does not contain any data 
   but the attribute is included to request the client to include the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute (Section 8.6) with the permanent 
   authentication identity in the EAP-Response/AKA-Identity message. In 
   this case, the AT_IDENTITY attribute contains the client's permanent 
   identity in the clear. 
    
   Please note that the EAP/AKA client and the EAP/AKA server only 
   process the AT_IDENTITY attribute. Entities that only pass EAP 
   packets through do not process this attribute. Hence, if the EAP 
   server is not co-located in the authenticator, then the 
   authenticator and other intermediate AAA elements (such as possible 
   AAA proxy servers) will continue to refer to the client with the 
   original identity from the EAP-Response/Identity packet regardless 
   if the decoding fails in the EAP server.

   In the worst case, there are three EAP/AKA-Identity round trips 
   before the server has obtained an acceptable identity: on the first 
   round, the client sends its re-authentication identity in 
   AT_IDENTITY. The server fails to accept it and request a full 
   authentication identity with a second EAP-Request/AKA-Identity. The 
   client responds with a pseudonym identity in AT_IDENTITY. The server 
   fails to decode the pseudonym and has to issue a third EAP-
   Request/AKA-Identity, including AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ. Finally, the 
   server accepts the client's EAP-Response/AKA-Identity with the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute and proceeds with full authentication. This is 
   illustrated in the figure below.

   After the last EAP-Response/AKA-Identity message, the full 
   authentication sequence proceeds as usual with the EAP Server 
   issuing the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message. 
    
   Because the keys that are used to protect the pseudonym are derived 
   from the AKA cipher key (CK) and the AKA integrity key (IK), the 
   identity privacy support is not available when EAP AKA is used in 
   the GSM compatible mode.

5. Re-authentication 
    
   In some environments, EAP authentication may be performed 
   frequently. Because the EAP AKA full authentication procedure makes 
   use of the UMTS AKA algorithms, and it therefore requires fresh 
   authentication vectors from the Authentication Centre, the full 
   authentication procedure may result in many network operations when 
   used very frequently. Therefore, EAP AKA includes a more inexpensive 
   re-authentication procedure that does not make use of the UMTS AKA 
   algorithms and does not need new vectors from the Authentication 
   Centre. 
    
   Re-authentication is optional to implement for both the EAP AKA 
   server and client. On each EAP authentication, either one of the 
   entities may also fall back on full authentication if they do not 
   want to use re-authentication. 
    
   Re-authentication is based on the keys derived on the preceding full 
   authentication. The same K_aut and K_encr keys as in full 
   authentication are used to protect EAP AKA packets and attributes, 
   and the original XKEY seed value from full authentication is used to 
   generate fresh application specific keys, as specified in Section 
   10. 
    
   On re-authentication, the client protects against replays with an 
   unsigned 16-bit counter, included in the AT_COUNTER attribute. On 
   full authentication, both the server and the client initialize the 
   counter to one. The counter value of at least one is used on the 
   first re-authentication. On subsequent re-authentications, the 
   counter MUST be greater than on any of the previous re-
   authentications. For example, on the second re-authentication, 
   counter value is two or greater etc. The AT_COUNTER attribute is 
   encrypted. 
    
   The server includes an encrypted server nonce (AT_NONCE_S) in the 
   re-authentication request. The AT_MAC attribute in the client's 
   response is calculated over NONCE_S to provide a challenge/response 
   authentication scheme. The NONCE_S also contributes to the new 
   application specific keys. 
    
   As discussed in Section 4.3, in some environments the client may 
   assume that the network can reliably store pseudonyms and therefore 
   the client may fail to respond to the AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ attribute. 
   The network SHOULD store pseudonyms on a reliable database. Because 
   one of the objectives of the re-authentication procedure is to 
   reduce load on the network, the re-authentication procedure does not 
   require the EAP server to contact a reliable database. Therefore, 
   the re-authentication procedure makes use of separate re-
   authentication user identities. Pseudonyms and the permanent IMSI-
   based identity are reserved for full authentication only. The 
   network does not need to store re-authentication identities as 
   carefully as pseudonyms. If a re-authentication identity is lost and 
   the network does not recognize it, the EAP server can fall back on 
   full authentication.

   If the EAP server supports re-authentication, it MAY include the 
   skippable AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID attribute in the encrypted data of EAP-
   Request/AKA-Challenge message. This attribute contains a new re-
   authentication identity for the next re-authentication. The client 
   MAY ignore this attribute, in which case it will use full 
   authentication next time. If the client wants to use re-
   authentication, it uses this re-authentication identity on next 
   authentication. Even if the client has a re-authentication identity, 
   the client MAY discard the re-authentication identity and use a 
   pseudonym or the IMSI-based permanent identity instead, in which 
   case full authentication will be performed. 
    
   The re-authentication identity received in AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID 
   contains both the username portion and the realm portion of the 
   Network Access Identifier. The EAP Server can choose an appropriate 
   realm part in order to have the AAA infrastructure route subsequent 
   re-authentication related requests to the same AAA server. For 
   example, the realm part MAY include a portion that is specific to 
   the AAA server. Hence, it is sufficient to store the context 
   required for re-authentication in the AAA server that performed the 
   full authentication. 
    
   The client MAY use the re-authentication identity in the EAP-
   Response/Identity packet or, in response to server's AT_ANY_ID_REQ 
   attribute, the client MAY use the re-authentication identity in the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute of the EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packet. 
    
   Even if the client uses a re-authentication identity, the server may 
   want to fall back on full authentication, for example because the 
   server does not recognize the re-authentication identity or does not 
   want to use re-authentication. If the server was able to decode the 
   re-authentication identity to the permanent identity, the server 
   issues the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge packet to initiate full 
   authentication. If the server was not able to recover the client's 
   identity from the re-authentication identity, the server starts the 
   full authentication procedure by issuing an EAP-Request/AKA-Identity 
   packet. This packet always starts a full authentication sequence if 
   it does not include the AT_ANY_ID_REQ attribute. (As specified in 
   Sections 4.2 and 4.3, the server MAY use AT_ANY_ID_REQ, 
   AT_FULLAUTH_ID_REQ or AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ attributes if it does not 
   know the client's identity.) 
    
   Both the client and the server SHOULD have an upper limit for the 
   number of subsequent re-authentications allowed before a full 
   authentication needs to be performed. Because a 16-bit counter is 
   used in re-authentication, the theoretical maximum number of re-
   authentications is reached when the counter value reaches 0xFFFF. 
    
   In order to use re-authentication, the client and the server need to 
   store the following values: original XKEY, K_aut, K_encr, latest 
   counter value and the next re-authentication identity.

   The following figure illustrates the re-authentication procedure. 
   Encrypted attributes are denoted with '*'. The client uses its re-
   authentication identity in the EAP-Response/Identity packet. As 
   discussed above, an alternative way to communicate the re-
   authentication identity to the server is for the client to use the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute in the EAP-Response/AKA-Identity message. This 
   latter case is not illustrated in the figure below, and it is only 
   possible when the server requests the client to send its identity by 
   including the AT_ANY_ID_REQ attribute in the EAP-Request/AKA-
   Identity packet. 
    
   If the server recognizes the re-authentication identity and agrees 
   on using re-authentication, then the server sends the EAP-
   Request/AKA-Reauthentication packet to the client. This packet MUST 
   include the encrypted AT_COUNTER attribute, with a fresh counter 
   value, the encrypted AT_NONCE_S attribute that contains a random 
   number chosen by the server, the AT_ENCR_DATA and the AT_IV 
   attributes used for encryption, and the AT_MAC attribute that 
   contains a message authentication code over the packet. The packet 
   MAY also include an encrypted AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID attribute that 
   contains the next re-authentication identity.  
    
   Re-authentication identities are one-time identities. If the client 
   does not receive a new re-authentication identity, it MUST use 
   either the permanent identity or a pseudonym identity on the next 
   authentication to initiate full authentication. 
    
   The client verifies that the counter value is fresh (greater than 
   any previously used value). The client also verifies that AT_MAC is 
   correct. The client MAY save the next re-authentication identity 
   from the encrypted AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID for next time. If all checks 
   are successful, the client responds with the EAP-Response/AKA-
   Reauthentication packet, including the AT_COUNTER attribute with the 
   same counter value and the AT_MAC attribute. 
    
   The server verifies the AT_MAC attribute and also verifies that the 
   counter value is the same that it used in the EAP-Request/AKA-
   Reauthentication packet. If these checks are successful, the re-
   authentication has succeeded and the server sends the EAP-Success 
   packet to the client.

   In the figure above, the first three messages are similar to the 
   basic re-authentication case. When the client detects that the 
   counter value is not fresh, it includes the AT_COUNTER_TOO_SMALL 
   attribute in EAP-Response/AKA-Reauthentication. This attribute 
   doesn't contain any data but it is a request for the server to 
   initiate full authentication. In this case, the client MUST ignore 
   the contents of the server's AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID attribute. 
    
   On receipt of AT_COUNTER_TOO_SMALL, the server verifies AT_MAC and 
   verifies that AT_COUNTER contains the same as in the EAP-
   Request/AKA-Reauthentication packet. If not, the server silently 
   discards the EAP-Response/AKA-Reauthentication packet. If all checks 
   on the packet are successful, the server transmits a EAP-
   Request/AKA-Challenge packet and the full authentication procedure 
   is performed as usual. Since the server already knows the subscriber 
   identity, it MUST NOT use the EAP-Request/AKA-Identity packet to 
   request the identity.

   Attribute Type 

      Indicates the particular type of attribute. The attribute type 
      values are listed in Section 12. 

   Length 

      Indicates the length of this attribute in multiples of 4 bytes. 
      The maximum length of an attribute is 1024 bytes. The length 
      includes the Attribute Type and Length bytes. 

   Value 

      The particular data associated with this attribute. This field is 
      always included and it is two or more bytes in length. The type 
      and length fields determine the format and length of the value 
      field. 

   When an attribute numbered within the range 0 through 127 is 
   encountered but not recognized, the EAP/AKA message containing that 
   attribute MUST be silently discarded. These attributes are called 
   non-skippable attributes. 

   When an attribute numbered in the range 128 through 255 is 
   encountered but not recognized that particular attribute is ignored, 
   but the rest of the attributes and message data MUST still be 
   processed. The Length field of the attribute is used to skip the 
   attribute value when searching for the next attribute. These 
   attributes are called skippable attributes. 

   EAP/AKA packets do not include a version field. However, should 
   there be a reason to revise this protocol in the future, new non-
   skippable or skippable attributes could be specified in order to 
   implement revised EAP/AKA versions in a backward-compatible manner. 

   Unless otherwise specified, the order of the attributes in an EAP 
   AKA message is insignificant, and an EAP AKA implementation should 
   not assume a certain order to be used.

   Attributes can be encapsulated within other attributes. In other 
   words, the value field of an attribute type can be specified to 
   contain other attributes. 
    
7. Message Authentication and Encryption 
    
   This section specifies EAP/AKA attributes for attribute encryption 
   and EAP/AKA message authentication. 
    
   Encryption and integrity protection are based on the AKA session 
   keys CK and IK. Because the CK and IK keys are derived from the RAND 
   challenge, these attributes can only be used in the EAP-Request/AKA-
   Challenge message and any EAP/AKA messages sent after it. For 
   example, these attributes cannot be used in EAP-Request/AKA-
   Identity, because the RAND challenge has not yet been transmitted at 
   that point. Integrity protection with AT_MAC MUST be used in all 
   messages when keys have been derived.  
    
   As there is no key derivation specification for the GSM mode, 
   attribute encryption and message integrity protection are not 
   available in the GSM mode. 
    
7.1. AT_MAC Attribute 
    
   The AT_MAC attribute can optionally be used for EAP/AKA message 
   integrity protection. Whenever AT_ENCR_DATA (Section 7.2) is 
   included in an EAP message, it MUST be followed (not necessarily 
   immediately) by an AT_MAC attribute. Messages that do not meet this 
   condition MUST be silently discarded. 
    
   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes 
   followed by a message authentication code (MAC). The MAC is 
   calculated over the whole EAP packet, concatenated with optional 
   message-specific data, with the exception that the value field of 
   the MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the MAC. The 
   reserved bytes are set to zero when sending and ignored on 
   reception.  
    
   The contents of the message-specific data, if present, are specified 
   separately for each EAP/AKA message. The message-specific data is 
   included in order to protect data that is not transmitted with the 
   EAP packet. 
    
   The format of the AT_MAC attribute is shown below.

      The MAC algorithm is HMAC-SHA1-128 [9] keyed hash value. (The 
      HMAC-SHA1-128 value is obtained from the 20-byte HMAC-SHA1 value 
      by truncating the output to 16 bytes. Hence, the length of the 
      MAC is 16 bytes.) The message authentication key (K_aut) used in 
      the calculation of the MAC is derived from the AKA integrity key 
      (IK) and cipher key (CK), as specified in Section 10.  

7.2. AT_IV, AT_ENCR_DATA and AT_PADDING Attributes 
    
   AT_IV and AT_ENCR_DATA attributes can be optionally used to transmit 
   encrypted information between the EAP/AKA client and server.  
    
   The value field of AT_IV contains two reserved bytes followed by a 
   16-byte initialization vector required by the AT_ENCR_DATA 
   attribute. The reserved bytes are set to zero when sending and 
   ignored on reception. The AT_IV attribute MUST be included if and 
   only if the AT_ENCR_DATA is included. Messages that do not meet this 
   condition MUST be silently discarded. 
    
   The sender of the AT_IV attribute chooses the initialization vector 
   by random. The sender MUST NOT reuse the initialization vector value 
   from previous EAP AKA packets but the sender MUST choose it freshly 
   for each AT_IV attribute. The sends SHOULD use a good source of 
   randomness to generate the initialization vector. The format of 
   AT_IV is shown below.

   The value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute consists of two 
   reserved bytes followed by bytes encrypted using the Advanced 
   Encryption Standard (AES) [10] in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) 
   mode of operation, using the initialization vector from the AT_IV 
   attribute. The reserved bytes are set to zero when sending and

   The encryption key (K_encr) is derived is derived from the AKA 
   integrity key (IK) and cipher key (CK), as specified in Section10. 
   The plaintext consists of nested EAP/AKA attributes. 
    
   The encryption algorithm requires the length of the plaintext to be 
   a multiple of 16 bytes. The sender may need to include the 
   AT_PADDING attribute as the last attribute within AT_ENCR_DATA. The 
   AT_PADDING attribute is not included if the total length of other 
   nested attributes within the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute is a multiple of 
   16 bytes. As usual, the Length of the Padding attribute includes the 
   Attribute Type and Attribute Length fields. The Length of the 
   Padding attribute is 4, 8 or 12 bytes. It is chosen so that the 
   length of the value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute becomes a 
   multiple of 16 bytes. The actual pad bytes in the value field are 
   set to zero (0x00) on sending. The recipient of the message MUST 
   verify that the pad bytes are set to zero, and silently drop the 
   message if this verification fails. The format of the AT_PADDING 
   attribute is shown below.

      Set to zero when sending, ignored on reception. 

   AT_RAND 

      The value field of this attribute contains two reserved bytes 
      followed by the AKA RAND parameter, 16 bytes (128 bits). The 
      reserved bytes are set to zero when sending and ignored on 
      reception. The AT_RAND attribute MUST be present in EAP-
      Request/AKA-Challenge. 

   AT_AUTN 

      The value field of this attribute contains two reserved bytes 
      followed by the AKA AUTN parameter, 16 bytes (128 bits). The 
      reserved bytes are set to zero when sending and ignored on 
      reception. The AT_AUTN attribute MUST NOT be included in the GSM 
      compatible mode of this protocol; otherwise it MUST be included.  

   AT_IV 

      See Section 7.2. 

   AT_ENCR_DATA 

      See Section 7.2. The nested attributes that are included in the 
      plaintext of AT_ENCR_DATA are described below. 

   AT_MAC 

      AT_MAC MUST NOT be included in GSM compatible mode; otherwise it 
      MUST be included. In EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge, there is no 
      message-specific data covered by the MAC. See Section 7.1. 

   In the EAP-Request/AKA-Challege message, the AT_IV, AT_ENCR_DATA and 
   AT_MAC attributes are used for IMSI privacy and for communicating 
   the next re-authentication identity. The plaintext of the 
   AT_ENCR_DATA value field consists of nested attributes, which are 
   shown below. Later versions of this protocol MAY specify additional 
   attributes to be included within the encrypted data.

   AT_NEXT_PSEUDONYM 

      This attribute is optional. The value field of this attribute 
      begins with a 2-byte actual pseudonym length, which specifies the 
      length of the pseudonym in bytes. This field is followed by a 
      pseudonym user name, of the indicated actual length, that the 
      client can use in the next authentication, as described in 
      Section 4.3. The user name does not include any terminating null 
      characters. Because the length of the attribute must be a 
      multiple of 4 bytes, the sender pads the pseudonym with zero 
      bytes when necessary. 

   AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID 

      The AT_NEXT_REAUTH_ID attribute is optional to include. The value 
      field of this attribute begins with a 2-byte actual re-
      authentication identity length, which specifies the length of the 
      re-authentication identity in bytes. This field is followed by a 
      re-authentication identity, of the indicated actual length, that 
      the client can use in the next re-authentication, as described in 
      Section 5. The re-authentication identity includes both a 
      username portion and a realm name portion. The re-authentication 
      identity does not include any terminating null characters. 
      Because the length of the attribute must be a multiple of 4 
      bytes, the sender pads the re-authentication identity with zero 
      bytes when necessary.  

   AT_PADDING 

      AT_PADDING is optional to include. See Section 7.2.

8.2. EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge 
    
   The format of the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge packet is shown below.  
    
   Later versions of this protocol MAY make use of the AT_ENCR_DATA and 
   AT_IV attributes in this message to include encrypted (skippable) 
   attributes. AT_MAC, AT_ENCR_DATA and AT_IV attributes are not shown 
   in the figure below. If present, they are processed as in EAP-
   Request/AKA-Challenge packet. The EAP server MUST process EAP-
   Response/AKA-Challenge messages that include these attributes even 
   if the server did not implement these optional attributes.

   Reserved 

      Set to zero when sending, ignored on reception. 

   AT_RES 

      This attribute MUST be included in EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge. 
      The value field of this attribute begins with the 2-byte RES 
      Length, which is identifies the exact length of the RES (or SRES) 
      in bits. The RES length is followed by the UMTS AKA RES or GSM 
      SRES parameter. According to the specification [12] the length of 
      the AKA RES can vary between 32 and 128 bits. The GSM SRES 
      parameter is always 32 bits long. Because the length of the 
      AT_RES attribute must be a multiple of 4 bytes, the sender pads 
      the RES with zero bits where necessary.  

   AT_MAC 

      AT_MAC MUST NOT be included in GSM compatible mode; otherwise it 
      MUST be included. In EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge, there is no 
      message-specific data covered by the MAC. See Section 7.1.

   AT_IDENTITY 

      The AT_IDENTITY attribute is optional to include and it is 
      included in cases defined in Section 4.2 and 4.3. The value field 
      of this attribute begins with 2-byte actual identity length, 
      which specifies the length of the identity in bytes. This field 
      is followed by the subscriber identity of the indicated actual 
      length, in the same Network Access Identifier format that is used 
      in EAP-Response/Identity, i.e. including the NAI realm portion. 
      The identity is the permanent IMSI-based identity, a pseudonym 
      identity or a re-authentication identity. The identity format is 
      specified in Section 4.1. The identity does not include any 
      terminating null characters. Because the length of the attribute 
      must be a multiple of 4 bytes, the sender pads the identity with 
      zero bytes when necessary.

9. Unsuccessful Cases 
    
   In general, if an EAP/AKA client or server implementation detects an 
   error in a received EAP/AKA packet, the EAP/AKA implementation 
   silently ignores the EAP packet, does not change its state and does 
   not send any EAP messages to its peer. Examples of such errors, 
   specified in detail elsewhere in this document, are an invalid 
   AT_MAC value, a mandatory attribute is missing, illegal attributes 
   included and an unrecognized non-skippable attribute. If no valid 
   packets are received, the authentication exchange will eventually 
   time out. 
    
   As normally in EAP, the EAP server sends the EAP-Failure packet to 
   the client when the authentication procedure fails on the EAP 
   Server. In EAP/AKA, this may occur for example if the EAP server is 
   not able to obtain authentication vectors for the subscriber or the 
   authentication exchange times out. 
    
10. Key Derivation 
    
   This section specifies how EAP AKA keying material is derived from 
   the IK and CK keys. Because IK and CK are not available in the GSM 
   mode, this key derivation specification can only be applied in the 
   UMTS AKA mode.

                        EAP AKA Authentication           November 2002 
    
   EAP AKA requires two keys for its own purposes, a message 
   authentication key K_aut and an encryption key K_encr, to be used 
   with the AT_MAC and AT_ENCR_DATA attributes. The same K_aut and 
   K_encr keys are used in full authentication and subsequent re-
   authentications. In addition, it is possible to derive additional 
   application specific key material, such as a master key to be used 
   with IEEE 802.11i. 
    
   Key derivation is based on the pseudo-random number generator 
   specified in NIST Federal Information Processing Standards 
   Publication 186-2 [13]. The pseudo-random number generator is 
   specified in the change notice 1 (2001 October 5)of [13] (Algorithm 
   1). As specified in the change notice (page 74), when Algorithm 1 is 
   used as a general-purpose random number generator, the "mod q" term 
   in step 3.2 is omitted. The function G used in the algorithm is 
   constructed via Secure Hash Standard as specified in Appendix 3.3 of 
   the standard. For convenience, the pseudo-random number algorithm 
   with the correct modification is cited in Annex B. 
    
   160-bit XKEY and XVAL values are used, so b = 160. The initial 
   secret seed value XKEY is computed from the AKA integrity key IK and 
   cipher key CK with the following formula: 

      XKEY = SHA1(Identity|IK|CK) 

   In the formula above, the "|" character denotes concatenation. 
   Identity denotes the user identity string without any terminating 
   null characters. It is the identity from the AT_IDENTITY attribute 
   from the last EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packet, or, if AT_IDENTITY 
   was not used, the identity from the EAP-Response/Identity packet.  
    
   The optional user input values (XSEED_j) in Step 3.1 are set to 
   zero.  
    
   The resulting 320-bit random numbers x_0, x_1, ..., x_m-1 are 
   concatenated and partitioned into suitable-sized chunks and used as 
   keys in the following order: K_encr (128 bits), K_aut (128 bits), 
   EAP application specific keys. The number of pseudo-random number 
   generator iterations (m) depends on the amount of required keying 
   material. The EAP application specific material immediately follows 
   K_aut. 
    
   On re-authentication, the same pseudo-random number generator can be 
   used to generate new application specific keys. The seed value XKEY 
   is calculated as follows: 

      XKEY = SHA1(Identity|counter|NONCE_S|original XKEY) 

   In the formula above, the Identity denotes the re-authentication 
   user identity, without any terminating null characters, from the 
   AT_IDENTITY attribute of the EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packet, or, 
   if EAP-Response/AKA-Identity was not used on re-authentication, the 
   identity string from the EAP-Response/Identity packet. The counter 
   denotes the counter value from AT_COUNTER attribute used in the EAP-
     
   Arkko and Haverinen     Expires in six months            [Page 43] 

                        EAP AKA Authentication           November 2002 
    
   Response/AKA-Reauthentication packet. The counter is used in network 
   byte order. NONCE_S denotes the 16-byte NONCE_S value from the 
   AT_NONCE_S attribute used in the EAP-Request/AKA-Reauthentication 
   packet. The original XKEY is the XKEY value from the preceding full 
   authentication. The pseudo-random number generator is run with the 
   new seed value XKEY, and the resulting 320-bit random numbers x_0, 
   x_1, ..., x_m-1 are concatenated and partitioned into suitable-sized 
   chunks and used as new application specific keys. 
    
   For example, the EAP application specific material can be used for 
   packet security between the client and the authenticator. Because 
   the required keying material depends on the EAP application and the 
   EAP key derivation standardization has not been finalized yet, rules 
   of key derivation cannot be given here. ). However, please see Annex 
   A for a specification of how keys for IEEE 802.11 are derived. 
    
   If a master session key is required, then the master session key is 
   the first EAP application specific key. On full authentication, the 
   master session key immediately follows K_aut in the key stream 
   resulting from the key expansion scheme. On re-authentication, the 
   master session key is the first new application specific key that is 
   derived. 
    
11. Interoperability with GSM 
    
   The EAP AKA protocol is able to authenticate both UMTS and GSM 
   users, if the subscriber's operator's network is UMTS aware. This is 
   because the home network will be able to determine from the 
   subscriber records whether the subscriber is equipped with a UMTS 
   USIM or a GSM SIM. A UMTS aware home network will hence always use 
   UMTS AKA with UMTS subscribers and GSM authentication with GSM 
   subscribers. With GSM subscribers, the EAP AKA protocol is always 
   used in the GSM compatible mode. 
    
   It is not possible to use a GSM AuC to authenticate UMTS 
   subscribers. (Note that if the home network doesn't support an 
   authentication method it should not distribute SIMs for that 
   method.) 
    
   However, it is possible that the node actually terminating EAP and 
   the node that stores the authentication keys (AuC) are separate, and 
   support different authentication types. If the node terminating EAP 
   is GSM-only but AuC is UMTS-aware, then authentication can still be 
   achieved using the GSM compatible version of EAP AKA. This 
   authentication will be weaker, since the GSM compatible mode does 
   not provide for mutual authentication. Section 6.8.1.1 in [1] 
   specifies how the GSM SRES parameter and the Kc key can be 
   calculated on the USIM and the AuC. If a UMTS terminal does not want 
   to accept the GSM compatible version of this protocol, then it can 
   reject GSM authentication by silently ignoring the GSM mode EAP-
   Request/AKA-Challenge packet.  
    
   In conclusion, the following table shows which variant of the EAP 
   AKA protocol should be run under different conditions:

   documentation include, but are not limited to, RFCs, the products of 
   another standards body (e.g. 3GPP), or permanently and readily 
   available vendor design notes. 
    
13. Security Considerations 
    
    
   The protocol in this document is intended to provide the appropriate 
   level of security to operate Extensible Authentication Protocol 
   using the UMTS AKA procedure in both physically insecure 
   environments and physically or otherwise secure environments, and 
   the GSM AKA procedure in physically or otherwise secure 
   environments. Implementations running the EAP AKA protocol will rely 
   on the security of the AKA scheme, and the secrecy of the symmetric 
   keys stored in the USIM and the AuC. This section highlights any 
   known vulnerabilities and the ways to address them. 
    
   The revised EAP base protocol [15] highlights several attacks that 
   are possible against the EAP protocol. Therefore it specifies 
   security requirements needed for standardizing EAP methods. This 
   section discusses how the security requirements are addressed in 
   EAP/AKA. 
    
13.1. Identity Protection and Privacy 
    
   The UMTS mode of EAP/AKA includes optional IMSI privacy support that 
   protects the privacy of the subscriber identity against passive 
   eavesdropping. The mechanism cannot be used on the first connection 
   with a given server, when the IMSI will have to be sent in the 
   clear. The terminal SHOULD store the pseudonym in a non-volatile 
   memory so that it can be maintained across reboots. An active 
   attacker that impersonates the network may use the 
   AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ attribute (Section 4.3) to learn the 
   subscriber's IMSI. However, as discussed in Section 4.3, the 
   terminal can refuse to send the cleartext IMSI if it believes that 
   the network should be able to recognize the pseudonym.  
    
   If the client and server cannot guarantee that the pseudonym will be 
   maintained reliably and IMSI privacy is required then additional 
   protection from an external security mechanism such as Protected 
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) [16] may be used. The 
   benefits and the security considerations of using an external 
   security mechanism with EAP/AKA are beyond the scope of this 
   document. 
    
   The GSM mode of EAP/AKA does not provide identity privacy. 
    
13.2. Mutual Authentication and Triplet Exposure 
    
   The UMTS mode of EAP/AKA provides mutual authentication via the UMTS 
   AKA mechanisms. The GSM mode does not provide mutual authentication.

13.3. Key Derivation Considerations 
    
   The UMTS mode of EAP/AKA supports key derivation with 128-bit 
   entropy. The key hierarchy is specified in Section 10. In the GSM 
   mode, EAP/AKA derives the 64-bit GSM Kc encryption key. 
    
13.4. Brute-Force and Dictionary Attacks 
    
   The effective strength of EAP/AKA values in the UMTS mode is 128-
   bits, and there are no known computationally feasible brute-force 
   attacks. As the GSM mode is not intended for insecure invironments, 
   brute-force attacks should not be possible. Because neither GSM or 
   UMTS AKA are password protocols, neither mode of EAP/AKA is 
   vulnerable to dictionary attacks. 
    
    
13.5. Packet Modification Attacks 
    
   In the UMTS mode, AT_MAC, AT_IV and AT_ENCR_DATA attributes are used 
   to provide integrity, replay and confidentiality protection for 
   EAP/AKA Requests and Responses. Integrity protection includes the 
   EAP header.  
    
   In UMTS mode, the contents of the EAP-Response/Identity packet are 
   implicitly integrity protected by including them in key derivation. 
    
   The GSM mode does not protect against packet modification attacks. 
    
   Because EAP/AKA is not a tunneling method, EAP Notification, EAP 
   Success or EAP Failure packets are not protected. On physically 
   insecure networks, this may enable an attacker to mount denial of 
   service attacks by sending false EAP Notification, EAP Success or 
   EAP Failure packets. However, the attacker cannot force the peers to 
   believe successful authentication has occurred when mutual 
   authentication failed or has not happened yet. 
    
13.6. Negotiation Attacks 
    
   EAP/AKA does not protect the EAP-Response/Nak packet. Because 
   EAP/AKA does not protect the EAP method negotiation, EAP method 
   downgrading attacks may be possible, especially if the user uses the 
   same identity with EAP/AKA and other EAP methods. 
    
   EAP/AKA does not support ciphersuite negotiation or EAP/AKA protocol 
   version negotiation. 
    
13.7. Fast Reconnect 
    
   The UMTS mode of EAP/AKA includes an optional re-authentication 
   ("fast reconnect") procedure, as recommended in [15] for EAP types 
   that are intended for physically insecure networks. 
    
13.8. Unreliable Media

                        EAP AKA Authentication           November 2002 
    
   EAP/AKA does not provide acknowledged Success or Failure 
   indications. If a Success or Failure packet is lost when using 
   EAP/AKA over an unreliable medium, and if the protocol over which 
   EAP/AKA is transported does not address the possible loss of Success 
   or Failure, then the peer and authenticator may end up having a 
   different interpretation of the state of the authentication 
   conversation. 
    
13.9. Man-in-the-middle Attacks 
    
   In order to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks and session hijacking, 
   user data SHOULD be integrity protected on physically insecure 
   networks. The EAP/AKA UMTS mode application specific keys or keys 
   derived from them MAY be used as the integrity protection keys, or, 
   if an external security mechanism such as PEAP is used, then the 
   link integrity protection keys MAY be derived by the external 
   security mechanism.  
    
   There are man-in-the-middle attacks associated with the use of any 
   EAP method within a tunneled protocol such as PEAP, or within a 
   sequence of EAP methods followed by each other. EAP/AKA does not 
   address these attacks If EAP/AKA is used with a tunneling protocol 
   or as part of a sequence of methods, there should be cryptographic 
   binding provided between the protocols and EAP/AKA to prevent man-
   in-the-middle attacks through rogue authenticators being able to 
   setup one-way authenticated tunnels. EAP/AKA application-specific 
   keys MAY be used to provide the cryptographic binding. However the 
   mechanism how the binding is provided depends on the tunneling or 
   sequencing protocol, and it is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
13.10. Generating Random Numbers 
    
   An EAP/AKA implementation SHOULD use a good source of randomness to 
   generate the random numbers required in the protocol. Please see 
   [17] for more information on generating random numbers for security 
   applications.

Annex A. Key Derivation for IEEE 802.11 
    
   As specified in Section 12, application specific keying material can 
   be derived with the pseudo-random function.  
    
   The key hierarchy in IEEE 802.11i currently assumes that EAP methods 
   produce a 256-bit long Pairwise Master Key (PMK) with 128 bits 
   entropy. When a Pairwise Master Key is required, it is the first EAP 
   application specific key that is derived. On full authentication, 
   the PMK immediately follows K_aut in the key stream resulting from 
   the key expansion scheme. On re-authentication, the PMK is the first 
   new application specific key that is derived. 
    
   For pre 802.11i networks, the signature key used to authenticate 
   broadcast keys in IEEE 802.1x is selected as the first 256 bits of 
   the EAP application specific keys immediately after K_aut. (On re-
   authentication, the first 256 application specific key bits are used 
   as the signature key.)  The next 256 bits are used as the WEP 
   session key.  The full 256-bit key is not usually used during WEP 
   encryption, unused bits at then end should be ignored by the 
   implementation. When the keys are transmitted from the authenticator 
   to the access point using the RADIUS protocol the session key is 
   placed in an MS-MPPE-RECV-KEY attribute and the signature key is 
   placed in an MS-MPPE-SEND-KEY attribute. These attributes are 
   defined in RFC 2548.

Annex B. Pseudo-Random Number Generator 
    
   The "|" character denotes concatenation, and "^" denotes involution. 
    
   Step 1: Choose a new, secret value for the seed-key, XKEY 
    
   Step 2: In hexadecimal notation let 
       t = 67452301 EFCDAB89 98BADCFE 10325476 C3D2E1F0 
       This is the initial value for H0|H1|H2|H3|H4  
       in the FIPS SHS [12] 
    
   Step 3: For j = 0 to m  1 do 
         3.1 XSEED_j = optional user input 
         3.2 For i = 0 to 1 do 
             a. XVAL = (XKEY + XSEED_j) mod 2^b 
             b. w_i = G(t, XVAL) 
             c. XKEY = (1 + XKEY + w_i) mod 2^b 
         3.3 x_j = w_0|w_1
