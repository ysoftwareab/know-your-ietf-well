Internet-Draft            Threat Analysis for NEMO          October 2003


1. Motivations

Networks in motion (NEMO) introduces a new network entity called Mobile 
Router(MR)[2]. MR has different features from Mobile Host that is operated 
based on Mobile IP technologies[4]. Since MR functions both as a mobile 
node and a gateway to provide mobile network with Internet access to 
outside world, it needs specific treatment for managing operations and 
securities.

In real world, many different types of NEMO configurations are possible 
including multi-homing, which means that new kind of threats specific to 
NEMO SHOULD be taken care of. For example, MR can advertise its IP 
prefix to the VMNs in its mobile network, and this RA message can be 
intercepted and modified to advertise the prefix of malicious router. 
This makes address spoofing attack possible: the packets that should be 
delivered to the destination mobile router are redirected to the attack 
router. Therefore, those messages like RA should be protected using 
authentication.

This draft proposes a three-layer threat model for analyzing 
vulnerabilities to NEMO protocols and entities. Based on the model, we 
describe and classify all possible threats to NEMO, and analyze those 
threats according to their properties and scopes. Finally, we describe 
the security requirements for NEMO.


2. Three-Layer Threat Model

Many different threats to network entities in NEMO are possible and hard 
to describe all of them in a row. Some of the threats can have multiple 
paths to achieve their goals, which means that many different types of 
attacks are possible to obtain the same objective that the attacker 
tries to achieve. Therefore, it requires a hierarchical threat model to 
describe and classify all different types of threats to NEMO.

This draft proposes a three-layer threat model to describe possible 
threats to NEMO according to their objectives/properties, target 
protocols/services, and target entities/entry points. This model is 
composed of a three-layer stack; objectives/properties on the top layer, 
target protocols/services for attack on the second layer, and finally 
target entities or entry points for attack at the bottom layer. 


S. Jung et. al.            Expires April, 2004                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            Threat Analysis for NEMO          October 2003



The objectives of threats are usually a limited number of goals that 
attackers try to achieve in abstract level. They could be like 
eavesdropping of data, impersonation, data corruption or modification, 
unauthorized use of resources, repudiation, and blocking services to 
clients. The generic goals of security mechanisms against those attacks 
therefore are such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, 
authorization, non-repudiation, and service availability, which are 
common to all of the security frameworks.

The second layer of the stack is composed of target protocols or services 
for attack. Attackers always try to find vulnerabilities to network 
protocols or services by monitoring protocol or service data specific to 
the target. In NEMO, for example, binding update(BU) message or router 
advertisement(RA) messages by MRs could be target data for attack. Most 
of NEMO signaling protocols could be the target at the second layer. 
Therefore, the vulnerabilities to the basic NEMO mechanism should be 
scrutinized for the analysis. In the next section, this draft will 
describe those vulnerabilities and possible threats related to them.

The bottom layer of the threat model is comprised of target entities or 
entry points for attacks. NEMO includes many network entities called MR, 
HA, CN, and MNN etc. Any of these entities could be a victim for attack, 
and be compromised. All the possibilities of different types of attacks 
should be investigated based on the assumption of these compromises. 
For example, the compromise of MR can result in the data interception 
of the MNNs inside or the deception of their connection to a fake HA 
or FA. The MNNs have no knowledge of the compromised MR, since the NEMO 
protocols are transparent to the MNNs. In section 4, those threats will 
be analyzed and described.


3. Threats to Target Protocols and Services

This section describes threats to NEMO protocols and services. NEMO 
operations are composed of two different planes; one is the signaling 
plane for exchanging control or routing information, and the other is 
the communication plane for exchanging data between nodes. The threats 
specific to each plane will be investigated.

3.1 Threats to Signaling Paths
The basic NEMO operations have three different signaling paths between 
entities; the first path is the signaling between MR and FA, the second 
one is the signaling between MR and HA, and the final one is the 
signaling between MNN and CN. Each signaling messages can be interrupted 
and modified by attackers on the way of the signaling paths. The following 
threats exist over signaling paths.


S. Jung et. al.            Expires April, 2004                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Threat Analysis for NEMO          October 2003    



     - Man-in-the-middle between MR and HA
       This threat means that an attacker resides between MR and HA, and 
       intercepts the signaling messages such as CoA(Care-of-Address) in 
       BU messages. The messages could be modified and transferred to the 
       HA with corrupted information. For example, the attacker compromises 
       the access router, and intercepts and modifies all the messages that 
       goes through the access router. One of the attack results will be 
       the registration of MR to HA with wrong binding information. 
       Security mechanism for bi-directional tunneling like IPsec could 
       prevent this threat.

     - Discard registration messages from MR to FA
       This threat is a sort of DoS attack to block network connectivity 
       service to MR. The attacker compromises the FA, and keep discarding 
       the registration message from MR. The result of the attack is no 
       availability of network connection service to the mobile networks.
     
     - Spoofing MR
       Mobile network could have multiple MRs for the case of 
       multi-homing. Assume that there is a mobile network with a single 
       MR. The fake MR claims to be the second MR for multihoming the 
       victim mobile network, and register to HA with another spoofed IP 
       prefix. The fake MR advertises its spoofed IP prefix to the new 
       VMNs that comes into play. 
       Then the victim VMN gets the wrong IP address from the fake MR, 
       and starts to communicate via the fake MR. 

     - Corrupted routing information
       Attacker may send corrupted routing information to MR and cause 
       network instability such as network congestion or looping. If the 
       MR is in the visited domain, it will not respond to the unsolicited 
       RA. But while the MR is in home domain, it still accepts the RA 
       messages, and may get screwed up with wrong routing information.
  
3.2   Threats to Communication Paths
      - eavesdropping/replay of messages between MR and HA
         All the data packets between MR and HA have to go through the 
         bi-directional tunnel. This tunnel should be secured by IPsec. 
         But some of the routing information that may not go through 
         this tunnel should be secured.

      - eavesdropping/replay of messages between MNN and CN
         The messages between MNN and CN are going through the 
         bi-directional tunnel, but there is no protection against 
         sniffing data between MR and MNN or between HA and CN. So 
         security mechanisms should be applied on the part of the 
         path uncovered.

      - location privacy
        Monitoring and analyzing the characteristics of data traffic 
        along the communication paths reveals some information on routing 
        and location privacy.

4. Threats to Target Entities

The basic network entities in NEMO are MR, HA, FA, CN on the main network, 
and LFN, LMN, and VMN in the mobile network. Any of these entities could 
be the target for attack. We will investigate possible threats caused by 
compromising the network entities like MR, HA, and FA. The compromise of 
an entity means that attacker can access the entity, and change or modify 
data inside the system. The following attacks are possible with the 
compromise of each entity. The authentication mechanism for each entity 
therefore should be applied.


   4.1 Misbehavior of MR
       MR is the most critical network component for the successful 
       operations in NEMO, thserfore, the correct operation of MR SHOULD 
       be assured. Most other routers have their own security functions 
       which MAY not enough to protect MR. The following are the 
       security threats which MAY be caused by misbehavior of MR. HA 
       need to check whether MR works correct. 
    
	- MR-HA spoofing
          MR-HA is the permanent address assigned statically or 
          dynamically to the MR by HA. MR-HA should be used for 
          identification of MR while it is in the visited domain. 
          The compromised MR can register to FA with a spoofed MR-HA, 
          and try to collect data destinated to the victim address.

        - MR-CoA spoofing
          MR-CoA is the Care-of-Address assigned to the egress interface 
          of MR by AR. The compromised MR can send a BU message to HA 
          with a spoofed CoA, and collect the data that were destinated 
          to the victim AR.

	- Cache poisoning 
          The cache data for routing table in MR can be corrupted to 
          subvert routing path. The data packet could be redirected or 
          looped causing network instability.

   4.2 Misbehavior of HA
        - sniffing of tunneled packet
          The IPsec transport mode should be used for securing the 
          tunneled packets between MR and HA. With the compromise of 
          the HA, the attacker can sniff the decrypted data packet 
          in HA.

        - corruption of binding cache
          HA keeps managing the BU information on binding cache. 
          With the corruption of binding information, the attacker 
          can redirects packets to where he want to deliver them.

   4.3 Traffic Analysis
       The location of MR or MNN inside the subnet may be the privacy of 
       the client, so the location information while network is in motion 
       should be secured. Attacker can analyze the header information 
       MR-CoA in the tunneled data packet and identify the location of 
       the MR. 
       Since all the data packets between MNN and CN are also tunneled 
       using MR-CoA as a new source address, the location of the MNN can 
       also be disclosed.
       
   4.4 Denial of Service
       Denial of Service attack is possible against MR and HA by flooding 
       BU messages and bogus tunneled packets. The attack can be more 
       effective with distributed fake MRs or HAs.

5.      Threats specific to the NEMO basic support protocol

    5.1 Corruption of Binding Cache by inside attacker
    
        The network configuration vulnerable to this attack is as 
        follows. A MR has the function of NAT server, and there is a 
        malicious MNN inside the mobile network. The malicious 
        MNN spoofs a BU message of the MR, and send it to the MR. 

        
        Assumptions
        
        The following analysis assumes:
        1. The BU packet from MR is requird to be protected by ESP transport 
           SA between MR and HA. 
           For exmaple, SA: src=CoA and dst=HA -> ESP transport HMACMD5 3DES

        2. The packets from MMN are encapsulted by IP-in-IP tunnel or IPSec 
           tunnel SA between MR and HA. 
           For example, IP-in-IP: scr=MNP and dst=any -> 
                        IP-in-IP tunnel, outer_src=CoA and outer_dst=HA
    
        3. We assume that IP-in-IP and IPSec tunnel SA are executed after 
           NAT/NAPT. NAT after IPSec tunnel will violate the SA and NAPT 
           doesn't have the port number to work with. The same thing to 
           IP-in-IP.

        A list of all possible attacks and countermeasures without NAT:
          1. MMN spoofs the CoA of MR; MR will drop any packets received 
             whose source IP address is CoA.
          2. MMN spoofs the CoA of nested MR; However, MMN can not forge 
             the ESP authentication data. HA will drop it.

	1. Malicious MNN makes the following packet and sends it to MR.

		   |------------------------------|
		   | source IP address = MNN      |
		   |------------------------------|
		   | destination IP address = HA  |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |            ......            |
		   |------------------------------|
		   | src port=any  |   dst port   |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |            ......            |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |    BU Options (MNP, CoA)     |
		   |------------------------------|

	 2. Assume that NAPT is used...

		   |------------------------------|
		   | source IP address = CoA      |
		   |------------------------------|
		   | destination IP address = HA  |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |            ......            |
		   |------------------------------|
		   | src port=any* |   dst port   |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |            ......            |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |    BU Options (MNP, CoA)     |
		   |------------------------------|

	Since NATP changes the source IP address into one globally 
	routable one, in this case, the only choice is CoA address of 
	MR. If there are multiple globally routable IP addresses 
	associated with MR and NAT is used, it may not cause problems 
	as long as source IP address is not changed into CoA. 

	3. If MR can't distinguish the NATed BU packets from those sent
	   by itself (Assume that BU sent from MR itself uses CoA as 
	   the source IP address. It is a reasonable assumption since 
	   only ESP transport mode is used. ), MR will use ESP transport 
	   mode to process the NATed BU packets.

		   |------------------------------|
		   | source IP address = CoA      |
		   |------------------------------|
		   | destination IP address = HA  |
		   |------------------------------|
 		   |             ESP              |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |            ......            |
		   |------------------------------|
		   | src port=any* |   dst port   |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |            ......            |
		   |------------------------------|
		   |    BU Options (MNP, CoA)     |
		   |------------------------------|

Internet-Draft            Threat Analysis for NEMO          October 2003



	The solution to this attack is that MR will check the source port 
	number in the BU packet with the NAPT mapping table where any used 
	port number has an entry. If there is such entry, MR will know this 
	packet is from MNN, thus MR will use IP-in-IP tunnel to encapsulate 
	it. Otherwise MR will use ESP SA to process it.

	For the purpose of efficiency, it is better to resist the attack 
	as early as possible. The list of other possible solutions:
	-  MR will check the type of packets from MMN. However, MR can't 
	   drop BU from MMN because MNN can be a nested MR.
	-  MR will check the type of packets from MMN and only allow BU 
	   transformed by ESP transport SA. However, MR can not verify such 
	   packets. Thus, attackers may still launch DoS attack to HA.
	-  MR may enforce the authentication in MN in order to make any 
	   attack accountable.


	4. HA will decapsulte and verify this incoming packet. If the 
	   verification is successful, HA believes that BU is from MR and 
	   updates the binding cache accordingly. Because HA can notice 
	   that it receives the BU from SA between CoA and itself but 
	   mobility option indicates a different CoA, HA will get confused. 
	   If HA accepts this BU, the binding cache will be polluted by 
	   attackers.
        
        The success of this attack depends on how the MR acts when it 
        process the fake packet. The MR MAY just drop the packet because 
        it has the same source address of itself, or process the packet 
        using IPsec traport mode. 
        
        We performed an experiment using Microsoft Window2000 as a NAT 
        server configuring with IPsec transport mode, which shows that 
        this threat is realistic. In the experiment, the fake packet from 
        a node inside mobile network could go through the Window2000 NAT 
        server (this could be a MR in NEMO case) to a machine in outside 
        networks (this could be a HA in NEMO case) wrapped into the IPsec 
        ESP encapsulation in transport mode.
        Since the current IPsec documents do not describe the details of 
        specification for the case of NAT server configured with IPsec, 
        the MR SHPULD take care of this potential vulnerability. For example, 
        the MR SHOULD distinguish the data packet from itself or inside node.
        For MIP, this vulnerability doesn't exist, because there is no reason 
        for a MN to forward a fake packet from the attacker using its own 
        IPsec SA. Therfore, this attack is very specific to NEMO protocol.

    5.2 Attack using HA as a stepping stone
    
        NEMO basic support draft suggests that the data packets from MMN 
        SHOULD be encapsulted by IP-in-IP tunnel. However, HA may become 
        the stepping stone to attackers. The following figure shows this
        threat. In the figure, malicious packets from MNN encapsulated 
        in IP-in-IP tunnel can go through MR and HA to be deivered to 
        the victim machine. The potential threats are IP spoofing, DoS 
        attack etc.

	   src=spoofed IP address
	   dst=victim
	   data payload

	3. src=spoofed IP address
	   dst=victim
	   data payload

	This threat MAY not only be specific to NEMO, but also to any 
	routers configured with IP-in-IP tunnel without any associated 
	security mechanisms. However, this threat could be more serious 
	due to the heavy usage of IP-in-IP tunnel in NEMO. 

    
    
    5.3 Attack to Location Privacy by Traffic Analysis
     
        In the basic NEMO configurations, all the traffic from mobile 
        network are supposed to go through the bi-directional tunnel
        between MR and HA. The HA can collect all the packets in 
        IP-in-IP tunne, decapsulates them, and forwards them to the CNs.
        
         
        |-----|         |----|   IP-in-IP tunnel  |----|         |----|
        | MNN |---------| MR | ================== | HA |---------| CN |
        |-----|    1    |----|          2         |----|    3    |----|
        
 
        The outside attacker can monitor the traffic in path 2 and 3. 
        The time variations of traffic in a specific tunnel between a
        specific MR and HA may have a similar pattern to the time 
        variation of traffic on a channel between HA and a specific CN. 
        By the statistical analysis on the time interval of peak traffic, 
        the attacker can find a correlation between incoming and outgoing 
        traffic pattern of HA, and finally finds the same connection 
        to extract the CoA information from the packet on path 2 and 
        the HA of MN from packet on path 3. This means that the 
        particular MN is located in the region of that particular CoA.
        This attack is not only specific to NEMO, but due to the 
        mandatory use of bi-directional tunnel, this attack can be more 
        serious in NEMO.

6.      Security Requirements for NEMO

        The basic support protocol for NEMO is based on the MIPv6 
        operations except the bi-directional tunnel operations between 
        MR and HA. Therefore, most of the security requirements are 
        already addressed in MIPv6 WG documents[4], so this draft describes 
        the security requirements only against new threats in NEMO. 
        The following security requirements SHOULD be addressed in NEMO 
        basic and extended documents.
        
        6.1 MR SHOULD check the contents of the packet from MNN inside , 
            and assure that the packet does not include fake information
            in the critical messages such as BU, prefix discovery, or 
            ICMP messages.
        6.2 The IP-in-IP encapsulated packet SHOULD be authenticated 
            between MR and HA, and per-packet authentication at MR 
            SHOULD be enforced. 
        6.3 The amount of traffic from MNN through the IP-in-IP tunnel 
            SHOULD be secured to protect the location privacy against 
            traffic analysis. The amount of traffic through IP-in-IP 
            tunnel MAY be secured using expanded field as in IPsec 
            ESP[10]. 
        6.4 HA SHOULD make sure that the MR is working correctly. 
            To check the right operation of MR, HA need to periodically 
            send test messages, and get the responses from MNN or CN. 
            A scheme similar to return routability MAY be used for 
            this purposes.
        6.5 The threats to new messages related to RO for extended NEMO 
            SHOULD be protected, but those threats will depends on what 
            sort of RO mechanism is used. The right security mechanism 
            for extended NEMO SHOULD be added later.
