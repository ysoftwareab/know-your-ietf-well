1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Introduction

   This specification defines a portion of the MIB for use with SNMP-
   based network management.  In particular, it defines objects for
   configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that employ the
   Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 (VRRPv3) for both IPv4
   and IPv6 as defined in RFC 5798 [RFC5798].

3.  Terminology

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Relationship to RFC 2787

   This document obsoletes RFC 2787 [RFC2787].  The major changes in
   this document reflect changes in the VRRP protocol between RFC 2338
   [RFC2338] and RFC 5798 [RFC5798].  This document is also updated to
   conform to current MIB conventions.

5.  Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB)

   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more
   interfaces, &quot;ifIndex&quot; is used as an index into the tables defined in
   the VRRP MIB.  This MIB module imports ifIndex from the IF-MIB.  At
   this time, the latest version of the IF-MIB is from RFC 2863
   [RFC2863].

6.  Multi-Stack Implementations

   This MIB module is designed to support multi-stack implementations
   that run VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6.  The IP version, Virtual Router
   Identifier (VRID), and ifIndex are used to uniquely identify rows in
   a multi-stack implementation.

7.  Interpretation of RFC 5798

   During the review of this document, it emerged that there are
   different possible interpretations of [RFC5798].  The authors of that
   document and the VRRP working group were unable to reach consensus as
   to which interpretation is correct.  This document makes the
   following assumption:

      IPv4 and IPv6 virtual routers are treated as two separate logical
      entities and represented as two separate entries in the
      vrrpv3OperationsTable.  This is required due to the undefined
      behavior of the protocol in [RFC5798] in a multi-stack scenario.

8.  VRRP MIB Structure and Design

   This MIB module contains three tables:

   (1)  The vrrpv3OperationsTable contains objects that define the
        operational characteristics of a VRRP router.  Rows in this
        table correspond to instances of virtual routers.

   (2)  The vrrpv3StatisticsTable contains the operating statistics for
        a VRRP router.

   (3)  The vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable contains the addresses of the
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up.

   Tables are indexed on ifIndex, VRID, and the IP version to uniquely
   identify a VRRP router.

   Notifications in this MIB module are controlled using the mechanisms
   defined in [RFC3413].

9.  VRRP Multi-Stack Scenario

   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in
   this MIB are instantiated.

   KEY:
   ----
   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the
   actual MIB objects as follows:

   if      = IfIndex
   AddrType= vrrpv3OperationsInetAddrType
   VrId    = vrrpv3OperationsVrId
   State   = vrrpv3OperationsStatus
   Prior   = vrrpv3OperationsPriority
   IpAddr  = vrrpv3OperationsMasterIpAddr

   The following figure shows a hypothetical network with two VRRP
   routers, VR1 &amp; VR2, configured with two virtual routers.  Addresses
   in &#x27;()&#x27; indicate the address of the default gateway for a given host;
   H1 to H4 are IPv4 hosts, and H5 to H8 are IPv6 hosts.  A, B, and C
   are IPv4 addresses, and X, Y, and Z are IPv6 addresses.  In the
   diagram, &quot;Interface&quot; is used in the context defined in IF-MIB.

   NOTES:

   1) For &quot;State&quot;: M = Master;   B = Backup.
      In the vrrpv3OperationsTable, a &quot;priority&quot; of 255 indicates that
      the respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address
      is native to the router (i.e., &quot;the IP Address Owner&quot;).

               &quot;An entry in the vrrpv3OperationsTable containing the
                operational characteristics of a virtual router.
                On a VRRP router, a given virtual router is
                identified by a combination of ifIndex, VRID, and
                the IP version.  ifIndex represents an interface of
                the router.

                A row must be created with vrrpv3OperationsStatus
                set to initialize(1) and cannot transition to
                backup(2) or master(3) until

             A priority of &#x27;0&#x27;, although not settable, is sent by
             the master router to indicate that this router has

             ceased to participate in VRRP, and a backup virtual
             router should transition to become a new master.

             A priority of 255 is used for the router that owns the
             associated IP address(es) for VRRP over IPv4 and hence
             is not settable.

             Setting the values of this object to 0 or 255 should be
             rejected by the agents implementing this MIB module.

             &quot;The RowStatus variable should be used in accordance to
              installation and removal conventions for conceptual
              rows.

              To create a row in this table, a manager sets this
              object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).
              Until instances of all corresponding columns are
              appropriately configured, the value of the
              corresponding instance of the
              &#x27;vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus&#x27; column will be read as
              notReady(3).

              In particular, a newly created row cannot be made
              active(1) until (minimally) the corresponding instance
              of vrrpv3OperationsInetAddrType, vrrpv3OperationsVrId,
              and vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr has been set, and
              there is at least one active row in the
              &#x27;vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable&#x27; defining an associated
              IP address.

              notInService(2) should be used to administratively
              bring the row down.

              A typical order of operation to add a row is:
              1. Create a row in vrrpv3OperationsTable with
              createAndWait(5).
              2. Create one or more corresponding rows in
              vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable.
              3. Populate the vrrpv3OperationsEntry.
              4. Set vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus to active(1).

              A typical order of operation to delete an entry is:
              1. Set vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus to notInService(2).
              2. Set the corresponding rows in
              vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable to destroy(6) to delete
              the entry.
              3. Set vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus to destroy(6) to
              delete the entry.&quot;

             &quot;The row status variable, used according to
             installation and removal conventions for conceptual

             rows.  To create a row in this table, a manager sets
             this object to either createAndGo(4) or
             createAndWait(5).  Setting this object to active(1)
             results in the addition of an associated address for a
             virtual router.  Setting this object to notInService(2)
             results in administratively bringing down the row.

             Destroying the entry or setting it to destroy(6)
             removes the associated address from the virtual router.
             The use of other values is implementation-dependent.

             Implementations should not allow deletion of the last
             row corresponding to an active row in
             vrrpv3OperationsTable.

             Refer to the description of vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus
             for typical row creation and deletion scenarios.&quot;

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The objects vrrpv3OperationsPriority, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr,
   vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval, vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode,
   vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode, vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus, and
   vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus possess the read-create attribute.
   Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation
   of a virtual router.

   Examples of how these objects could adversely affect the operation of
   a virtual router include:

   o An unauthorized change to vrrpv3OperationsPriority can affect the
     priority used in master election, resulting in this router either
     becoming master when it should not, or in some other router being
     elected by preference.  While this will disrupt the operator&#x27;s
     plans, it will only replicate the unfortunate failure of multiple
     routers, and any router that does become master will be capable of
     filling that role.

   o Modification of vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr would cause the
     configured router to take on an incorrect IP address if it becomes
     master, which would be potentially very disruptive to the network
     operation.

   o A malicious change to vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval could either
     result in the configured router flooding the network with
     advertisements when it becomes master, or the new master not
     advertising frequently enough such that some routers do not learn
     about the new master.

   o vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode controls whether this router will
     preempt another master router.  Setting it inappropriately will at
     worse cause one router to be master against the operator&#x27;s plans,
     but that router will still be qualified to operate as a master.

   o Setting the vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode could prevent an
     IPv6-capable VRRP router from accepting packets addressed to the
     address owner&#x27;s IPv6 address as its own even if it is not the IPv6
     address owner.  Although the default for this object is false(2),
     unauthorized setting of this object to false might restrict the
     function of some parts of the network.

   o The vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus object that could be used to disable
     a virtual router.  While there are other columns that, if changed,
     could disrupt operations, they cannot be changed without first
     changing the RowStatus object.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)

   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

12.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        vrrpv3MIB           { mib-2 207 vrrpv3MIB VRRPV3-MIB }

   This document obsoletes RFC 2787.  Therefore, IANA has deprecated
   value 68 under &#x27;mib-2&#x27;, which is assigned to VRRP-MIB.
