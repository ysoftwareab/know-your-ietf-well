1.  Introduction

   Chapter 3.5 of [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] defines two keep-alive
   techniques.  Even though the keep-alive techniques are separated from
   the Outbound mechanism [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], it is currently not
   possible to indicate support of the keep-alive techniques without
   also indicating support for the Outbound mechanism.  In addition, as
   described in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], for dialog initiated outbound
   flows a separate mechanism is used to indicate and negotiate support
   of keep-alives.

   The Outbound mechanism is enabled during the UA registration phase.
   However, there are use-cases where the UA does not register itself,
   but still needs to be able to make calls and maintain NAT bindings
   open during the duration of that call.  A typical example is
   emergency calls.  There are also cases where entities do not support
   the Outbound mechanism, but still want to be able to indicate support
   and use the keep-alive techniques defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].
   In addition, the Outbound mechanism also allows the establishment of
   flows using initial dialog SIP requests.  As specified in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], keep-alives must be separately negotiated
   for such flows.

   Another use-case is when network entities (SIP proxies) need to
   perform heartbeats between themselves.  The keep-alive techniqurs
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] can be used for providing the
   heartbeats, and the mechanism in this document can be used by the
   entities to indicate and negotiate support of the keep-alive
   techniques.

   This specification defines a new SIP Via header parameter, "keep",
   which can be used by a UA to indicate support of the keep-alive
   techniques defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  The UA will insert
   the "keep" parameter in the Via header of the REGISTER request, or
   the initial session request if not registered.

   This specification also defines a "yes" value for the "keep"
   parameter.  The edge proxy will add a "yes" value to the "keep"
   parameter, if received in the topmost Via header, to indicate support
   of the keep-alive techniques defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].


2.  Conventions

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Definitions

   Edge proxy: As defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], an Edge Proxy is
   any proxy that is located topologically between the registering User
   Agent and the Authoritative Proxy.  The "first" edge proxy refers to
   the first edge proxy encountered when a UA sends a request.

   'keep' Parameter: The 'keep' parameter is a SIP Via header parameter
   which indicates that the entity inserting the parameter supports the
   keep-alive techniques defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  The
   parameter may carry an associated parameter value.


4.  Requirements

   REQ 1: It MUST be possible for a SIP entity acting as a UAC to
   indicate support of the keep-alive techniques defined
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] towards the next hop, if the UA supports only
   the keep-alive part of [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].

   REQ 2: It MUST be possible for a SIP entity acting as a UAS to
   indicate support of the keep-alive techniques defined
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] towards the previous hop, if the edge poxy
   supports only the keep-alive part of [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].

   REQ 3: It MUST be possible for SIP entities which supportthe
   proceduers in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] to indicate, and negotiate
   support of, keep-alives for Outbound dialog flows
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].


5.  Client behavior

   A SIP entity aciting as a UAC which supports the method defined in
   this specification MUST act as a STUN client
   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis], and MUST support the amount of STUN
   which is required to apply the STUN keep-alive technique
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].

   When a SIP entity acting as a UAC (UA or proxy) which supports the
   method defined in this specification sends a SIP REGISTER request,
   and the UAC wants to send keep-alives towards the next hop, the
   entity MUST insert a "keep" Via parameter in the SIP request.  If the
   Via header in the SIP REGISTER response contains a "keep" parameter
   with a "yes" value, the UA knows that the keep-alive techniques
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] can be used between the entity and
   the next hop during the duration of the registration.  If the SIP
   REGISTER response contains a Flow-Timer header



Holmberg                 Expires August 21, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  STUN-keep                  February 2009


   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], and the UAC uses the server recommended
   keepalive frequency provided in the header, the UAC SHOULD send its
   keepalives so that the interval between each keepalive is randomly
   distributed between 80% and 100% of the server provided time.  If no
   Flow-Timer header field was present in the SIP REGISTER response, the
   UA can send keepalives at its discretion.  The UA must insert a
   "keep" parameter even if the UA also indicates support of Outbound
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], to allow keep-alive usage in cases where the
   edge proxy will only support "keep".

   When a UAC which supports the method defined in this specification
   sends an initial SIP request, the UAC has not registered itself via
   the edge proxy towards which the SIP request is sent, and the UAC
   wants to send keep-alives towards the next hop, the UAC MUST include
   a "keep" Via parameter in the SIP request.  If the Via header header
   in the initial SIP responses contains a "keep" parameter with a "yes"
   value, the UA knows that the keep-alive techniques defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] can be used between the UAC and the next hop
   during the duration of the call.  If the initial SIP response
   contains a Flow-Timer header [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], and the UAC
   uses the recommended keepalive frequency provided in the header, the
   UAC SHOULD send its keepalives so that the interval between each
   keepalive is randomly distributed between 80% and 100% of the server
   provided time.  If no Flow-Timer header field was present in the
   initial SIP response, the UA can send keepalives at its discretion.
   If the UAC wishes to apply keep-alive for future calls, it MUST
   insert a "keep" Via parameter in the initial SIP request of those
   calls.

   NOTE: Since there are clients that already use CRLF keep-alives, and
   proxies are expected to be able to receive it, this specification
   does not forbid the sending of CRLF keep-alives even when no
   "keep=yes" indication has been received from the edge proxy.
   However, the indicator is still important in order for the client to
   inform the edge proxy that the client supports CRLF keep-alives, so
   that the edge proxy does not use other mechanisms (e.g. short
   registration refresh intervals) in order to make sure the NAT
   bindings are kept open.


6.  Server behavior

   A SIP entity acting as a UAS (UA or proxy) which supports the method
   defined in this specification MUST act as a STUN server
   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis], and MUST support the amount of STUN
   which is required to apply the STUN keep-alive technique
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  The UAS MUST also process double-CRLF keep-
   alives, as defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].

Internet-Draft                  STUN-keep                  February 2009


   When a UAS that supports the method defined in this specification
   recieves a SIP REGISTER request which contains a "keep" parameter in
   the topmost Via header, and the UAS wants to allow the sender of the
   SIP REGISTER request to send keep-alives towards the UAS during the
   duration of the registration, the UAS proxy MUST add a "yes" value to
   the "keep" parameter.  In addition the UAS MAY include a Flow-Timer
   header field if the associated SIP REGISTER response.

   When a UAS that supports the method defined in this specification
   recieves an initial SIP request which contains a "keep" parameter in
   the topmost Via header, and the UAS wants to allow the sender of the
   initial SIP request to send keep-alives towards the UAS during the
   duration of the call, the UAS proxy MUST add a "yes" value to the
   "keep" parameter.  In addition the UAS MAY include a Flow-Timer
   header field if the associated initial SIP response.


7.  Proxy behavior

   A proxy acting as a UAC, that wants to use the mechanism in this
   document, shall follow the procedures defined in Section 5.

   A proxy acting as a UAS, that wants to use the mechanism in this
   document, shall follow the procedures defined in Section 6.


8.  Overlap with connection reuse

   The connect-reuse specification [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse]
   specifies how to use connection-oriented transports to send requests
   in the reverse direction.  SIP entity A opens a connection to entity
   B in order to send a request.  Under certain conditions entity B can
   reuse that connection for sending requests in the backwards direction
   to A as well.  However, the connect-reuse specification does not
   define a keep-alive mechanism for this connection.

   The technique specified in this draft is thus orthogonal to the
   purpose of connection reuse.  An entity that wants to use connection-
   reuse as well as indicate keep-alive mechanism on that connection
   will insert both the "alias" parameter defined in [connect-reuse] as
   well as the "keep" parameter defined in this memo.  Inserting only
   one of these parameters is not a substitute for the other.  Thus,
   while the presence of a "keep" parameter will indicate that the enity
   supports keep-alives in order to keep the connection open, no
   inference can be drawn on whether that connection can be used for
   requests in the backwards direction.

9.  Example

   The figure shows an example where a non-registered UAC sends an
   INVITE reuqest, in which it indicates support of keep-alive by
   inserting a "keep" parameter in the Via header of the INVITE request.
   The edge proxy (P1) also supports the keep-alive mechanism, so it
   adds a "yes" value to the "keep" parameter to the Via header of the
   UAC.  The request is then fowarded towards the UAS.  When UAC
   receives the 200 OK (INVITE) response from the UAS it finds out that
   the edge proxy supports keep-alive.  After that the UAC sends
   periodic keep-alives (in this example using the STUN keep-alive
   technique) during the duration of the call.  The edge proxy (P1) has
   inserted a Flow-Timer header in the 200 OK (INVITE), indicating a
   recommented keep-alive interval of 30 seconds.
