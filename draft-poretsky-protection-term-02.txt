1. Introduction 

        The IP network layer provides route convergence to protect data  
        traffic against planned and unplanned failures in the internet. 
        Fast convergence times are critical to maintain reliable network  
        connectivity and performance.  Technologies that function at sub-IP  
        layers can be enabled to provide further protection of IP  
        traffic by providing the failure recovery at the sub-IP layers so  
        that the outage is not observed at the IP-layer.  Such technologies  
        include High Availability (HA) stateful failover.  Virtual Router  
        Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Automatic Link Protection (APS) for  
        SONET/SDH, Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) for Ethernet, and Fast  
        Reroute for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS).   
         
        Benchmarking terminology and methodology have been defined for  
        IP-layer route convergence [7,8,9].  New terminology and  
        methodologies specific to benchmarking sub-IP layer protection  
        mechanisms are required.  This will enable different implementations  
        of the same protection mechanisms to be benchmarked and evaluated.   
        In addition, different protection mechanisms can be benchmarked and  
        evaluated.  The metrics for benchmarking the performance of sub-IP  
        protection mechanisms are measured at the IP layer, so that the  
        results are always measured in reference to IP and independent of

Internet-Draft         Benchmarking Terminology for           June 2006 
                          Protection Performance  

        the specific protection mechanism being used. The purpose of this  
        document is to provide a single terminology for benchmarking sub-IP  
        protection mechanisms.  It is intended that there can exist unique  
        methodology documents for each sub-IP protection mechanism. 
         
        Figure 1 shows the fundamental model that is to be used in  
        benchmarking sub-IP protection mechanisms.  Protection Switching  
        consists of a minimum of two Protection-Switching Nodes with a  
        Primary Path and a Backup Path.  A Failover Event occurs along the  
        Primary Path.  A tester is set outside the two nodes as it sends  
        and receives IP traffic along the Working Path.  The Working Path  
        is the Primary Path prior to the Failover Event and the Backup Path  
        following the Failover Event.  If Reversion is supported then the

       Figure 1.  System Under Test (SUT) for Sub-IP Protection Mechanisms 
      
        Working Path is the Primary Path after Failure Recovery.  The  
        tester MUST record the IP packet sequence numbers, departure time,  
        and arrival time so that the metrics of Failover Time, Additive  
        Latency, and Reversion Time can be measured.  The Tester may be a 
        single device or a test system.

2. Existing definitions        
        This document draws on existing terminology defined in other BMWG 
        work.  Examples include, but are not limited to: 
      
             Latency                   [RFC 1242, section 3.8] 
             Frame Loss Rate           [RFC 1242, section 3.6] 
             Throughput                [RFC 1242, section 3.17] 
             Device Under Test (DUT)   [RFC 2285, section 3.1.1] 
             System Under Test (SUT)   [RFC 2285, section 3.1.2] 
             Out-of-order Packet       [Ref.[4], section 3.3.2] 
             Duplicate Packet          [Ref.[4], section 3.3.3] 
      
        This document adopts the definition format in Section 2 of RFC 1242. 
      
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119.  
   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

       3.1.1 Path 
      
         Definition: 
             A sequence of nodes, <R1, ..., Rn>, with the following 
             properties: 
             - R1 is the ingress node and forwards IP packets, which input 
             into DUT/SUT, to R2 as sub-IP frames. 
             - Ri is a node which forwards data frames to R[i+1] for all i, 
             1<i<n, based on information in the sub-IP layer. 
             - Rn is the egress node and it outputs sub-IP frames from 
             DUT/SUT as IP packets. 
      
         Discussion: 
             The path is defined in the sub-IP layer in this document, unlike 
             an IP path in RFC 2026.  For example, the SONET/SDH path, the 
             label switched path for MPLS, and optical path.  One path may be 
             regarded as being equivalent to one IP link between two IP 
             nodes, i.e., R1 and Rn.  The two IP nodes may have multiple 
             paths for protection.  A packet will travel on only one path 
             between the nodes.  Packets belonging to a micro flow (RFC 2474) 
             will transverse one or more paths.  The path is unidirectional.

         Issues: 
             "A bidirectional path", which transmits traffic in both 
             directions along the same nodes, consists of two unidirectional 
             paths.  Therefore, the two unidirectional paths belonging to 
             "one bidirectional path" will be treated independently when 
             benchmarking for " a bidirectional path".

             - Ri is a node which forwards data frames to R[i+1] for all i, 
             1<i<n, based on information in the sub-IP layer.

           A tunnel is used to carry a specific flow of traffic which is 
           generally large aggregation of microflows, but may be any flow 
           defined by a classifier at the ingress. A Tunnel may include two 
           primary paths during the MPLS make-before-break reroute.

        3.1.6.  Backup Path 

         Definition: 
             A path that exists to carry data traffic only if a Failover  
             Event occurs. 
      
         Discussion: 
             The Backup Path is the Working Path upon a Failover Event.  
             There are various types of Backup Paths: a dedicated recovery 
             path (1+1), which has 100% redundancy for a specific ordinary 
             path, a shared Backup Path (1:N), which is dedicated to the 
             protection for more than one specific Primary Path, and an 
             associated shared Backup Path (M:N) for which a specific set 
             of Backup Paths protects a specific set of more than one 
             Primary Path. Backup path is always computed before the failover  
             event. A new path computed after the failover event is simply    
             reroute of the primary path. A backup may be signaled or  
             Unsignalled.

          Paths that protect a segment of a path may merge beyond the segment 
          being protected and are considered disjoint if they do not use a 
          link from the set of links in the protected segment. A path is node 
          disjoint if it does not share a common node other than the ingress 
          and egress.

         Definition: 
             To identify a Primary Path failure at a sub-IP layer.   
      
         Discussion: 
             Failure Detection occurs at the ingress node of the Primary  
             Path.  Failure Detection occurs via a sub-IP mechanism such 
             as detection of a link down event or timeout for receipt 
             of a control packet. A failure may be completely isolated. A  
             failure may affect a set of links which share a single SRLG (e.g.  
             port with many sub-interfaces). A failure may affect multiple  
             links that are not part of SRLG.

          that results in a change in the Path that data traffic traverses. 
      
         Discussion: 
          Failover Events include, but are not limited to, link failure  
          and router failure.  Routing changes are considered Convergence  
          Events [7] and are not Failover Events.  This restricts  
          Failover Events to sub-IP layers. Failover may be at the PLR or at 
          the ingress. If the failover is at the ingress it is generally on a 
          disjoint path from the ingress to egress.

        Discussion: 
        Failover to a Backup Path provides Link Protection, Node Protection, 
        or Path Protection.  Failover is complete when Lost Packets,  
        Out-of-Order Packets, and Duplicate Packets are no longer observed.

         Definition: 
             The act of Failover Recovery in which the Primary Path is 
             restored following a Failover Event. 
      
         Discussion: 
             Failure Recovery MUST occur when the Backup Path is the  
             Working Path.  The Backup Path is maintained as the  
             Working Path during Failure Recovery. This implies that the  
             service is either restored fully or partially. Usually, FRR  
             restoration can cause congestion, but primary paths rerouting  
             avoid restoration. An unavoidable problem in any restoration is  
             the discontinuity in end to end delay when the primary and    
             backup path delays differ significantly. If the backup path has  
               a shorter delay out of order delivery may occur if restoration    
             is fast.  If the backup path is longer then a sudden 
             increase in delay will occur which can affect real time    
             applications which use playback buffers to remove limited    
             jitter.

             Based on the functionality of the PLR, its role is defined based    
             on the type of method used. If it is one-to-one backup method,  
             the PLR is responsible for computing a separate backup LSP,  
             called a detour LSP for each LSP that PLR is protecting. And in  
             case if facility backup method is used, the PLR creates a single  
             bypass tunnel that can be used to protect multiple LSPs.

          Failover. 
           
        Discussion:          
        Based on the functionality of the Head-end, its role is defined to 
        be as the ingress of the signaled LSP. It could also occur, that 
        this node happens to be a PLR. In this scenario the term head-end 
        failover node is defined.

      3.5.1.  Failover Packet Loss  

         Definition: 
          The amount of packet loss produced by a Failover Event 
          until Failover completes. 
            
         Discussion: 
          Packet loss can be observed as a reduction of forwarded traffic  
          from  the maximum forwarding rate.  Failover Packet Loss includes  
          packets that were lost and packets that were delayed due to  
          buffering.  Failover Packet Loss MAY reach 100% of the offered  
          load.

        Definition: 
          The amount of packet loss produced by Reversion. 
      
         Discussion: 
          Packet loss can be observed as a reduction of forwarded traffic  
          from  the maximum forwarding rate.  Reversion Packet Loss includes

        3.6.1. Failover Time 


          Definition: 
          The amount of time it takes for Failover to complete so that  
          the Backup Path is the Working Path.

         Discussion: 
             Failover Time can be calculated from Failover Packet Loss  
             that occurs due to a Failover Event and Failover as shown 
             below in Equation 1:   
      
          (eq 1) Failover Time = 
               Failover Packets Loss / Offered Load 
               NOTE: Units for this measurement are  
               packets / packets/second = seconds 
      
             Failover Time includes failure detection time and time for 
             data traffic to begin traversing the Backup Path. 
      
         Measurement units: 
             Seconds

        3.6.2.  Additive Backup Latency 

        Definition: 
             The amount of increased latency resulting from data traffic  
             traversing the Backup Path instead of the Primary Path.  
      
         Discussion: 
             Additive Backup Latency is calculated using Equation 2 as  
             shown below: 
      
             (eq 2) Additive Backup Latency = 
                    Backup Path Latency - Primary Path Latency. 
      
         Measurement units: 
             Seconds

         Issues: 
             Additive Backup Latency MAY be a negative result.  This is 
             theoretically possible, but could be indicative of a  
             sub-optimum network configuration .

        3.6.3.  Reversion Time 

        Definition: 
          The amount of time it takes for Reversion to complete so  
          that the Primary Path is restored as the Working Path.   
      
         Discussion: 
          Reversion Time can be calculated from Reversion Packet  
          Loss that occurs due to a Failure Recovery as shown 
          below in Equation 3:   
      
          (eq 3) Reversion Time = 
          Reversion Packets Loss / Offered Load 
          NOTE: Units for this measurement are  
          packets / packets/second = seconds 
      
          Reversion Time starts upon completion of Failure Recovery 
          and includes the time for data traffic to begin traversing  
          the Primary Path.
