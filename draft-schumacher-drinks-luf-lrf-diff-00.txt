Look Up Function vs. Location Routing Function discussion  October 2008 
    

Abstract 

   This document provides a comparison between the Look Up Function 
   (LUF) and the Location Routing Function (LRF) as used for inter and 
   intra-domain SIP session routing.  It also develops the relationship 
   between the two functions.

1. Introduction 

   In [SPEERMINT-Terminology] the a definition of the Look Up Function 
   (LUF) and the Location Routing Function is provided.  However in 
   subsequent DRINKS discussions, the specific aspects attributable to 
   each function is not clear.  It has been easy to consider the 
   operation of both of the functions when combined - a SIP address 
   (URI) is provided to the LUF and a route to the next SSP is provided 
   out of the LRF.  However when each function is considered in situ 
   relative to the other, the concept consistency breaks down in to a 
   number of different definitions.  This extends to where in a SSP's 
   network the function resides and what sort of data it operates on. 

   In this document, the definition of each function will be expanded 
   beyond what is done in [SPEERMINT-Terminology]. Finally the 
   relationship between the LUF and LUF will be developed to provide a 
   clearer distinction of the functions. 

2. Terminology  

          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. The

   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary".  

3. Review of SPEERMINT Terminology 

   In [SPEERMINT-Terminology] the definition of the LUF is: 

   The Look-Up Function (LUF) provides a mechanism for determining for 
   a given request the target domain to which the request should be 
   routed.  

   In some cases, some entity (usually a 3rd party or federation) 
   provides peering assistance to the originating SSP by providing this 
   function.  The assisting entity may provide information relating to 
   direct (Section 4.2.1) or indirect (Section 4.2.2) peering as 
   necessary. [From Section 4.3.1] 

   And in [SPEERMINT-Terminology] the definition of the LRF is: 

   The Location Routing Function (LRF) determines for the target domain 
   of a given request the location of the SF in that domain and 
   optionally develops other SED required to route the request to that   
   domain.  

      In some cases, some entity (usually a 3rd party or federation) 
   provides peering assistance to the originating SSP by providing this    
   function.  The assisting entity may provide information relating to 
   direct (Section 4.2.1) or indirect (Section 4.2.2) peering as 
   necessary. [From Section 4.3.2]
