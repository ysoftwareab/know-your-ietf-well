1. Abstract

   GMPLS [2] has now been proposed as an extension to the MPLS
   framework to include non packet-switched optical technologies, such
   as time-division multiplexing (PDH/SDH/SONET) and wavelength
   division multiplexing (lambdas/fibers). This draft proposes an
   enhanced label request format for such optical technologies, which
   accounts for some special characteristics of these technologies
   (see, for instance, [3], [4], [5])that differentiate them from

   packet-switched technologies. When enumerating our encoding, we
   focus, for clarity, on optical TDM technologies, since the standards
   for these are well-defined, but it will be seen that the proposal
   has very general applicability.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [6].


3. Why is this Refinement Needed?

   The signaling refinements proposed in this draft come from the
   recognition of a fundamental distinction between non packet-switched
   and packet-switched technologies. Namely, that in the non-packet
   switched case, a link is capable of switching a small (fixed) number
   of discrete signals, which we call "link connections," and that an
   LSP may be comprised of one of these discrete signals, thus
   requiring a particular link connection capability at a switch.
   Thus, an intermediate switch must know the signal type of an LSP
   that desires to go through it, to determine if it has the correct
   link connection(s) to switch that LSP. In the optical TDM world,
   these link connections take the form of signals in the SDH/SONET
   multiplex [3], [5], which is a systematic arrangement of different
   TDM signals in a multiplexing tree or hierarchy [3], while in the
   optical WDM world they may (among other things) take the form of
   signals transmitted at discrete wavelengths/frequencies, with some
   particular, even spacing between them [5], such as 100 GHz, 50 GHz,
   or 25 GHz. In other words, each non packet-switched link is capable
   of carrying over it a certain number and type(s) of link
   connections, which are switched by the switching element.

   By contrast, in packet- or cell-multiplexed links, the "link
   connections" that are available are flexible, ranging continuously
   from those with a certain minimum bandwidth to those with a certain
   maximum bandwidth. For instance, a POS link can accommodate any
   packet LSP with a bandwidth up to the maximum available bandwidth of
   the link, or any combination of LSPs such that their aggregate
   bandwidth does not exceed what is allowed by connection admision
   control . In this case, one may distinguish between the link
   connections based on their bandwidth, since there is only one type
   of signal (comprised of IP packets) that such a link carries.

   With optical TDM links, however, it is crucial to know the switching
   capability supported by the end of a link, because it determines
   which hierarchy a link supports, and the types of link connections
   within that multiplex hierarchy that the link supports. Since the
   link connections provided by a link are of fixed, discrete types,
   the link connections suitable for carrying an LSP are now limited to
   those that match the nature or type of the LSP (we make this more
   precise in Sections 5 and 6), or to which the LSP can be readily

   adapted (by mapping it to a container, for instance). The situation
   is futher complicated by the fact that a given interface may support
   multiple levels (or multiple types of link connections) of a TDM
   hierarchy, or indeed multiple hierarchies [5].

   Thus, it is necessary to indicate the signal type of the LSP so that
   an intermediate node can select those links that support link
   connections suitable for carrying that LSP. (Obviously, this also
   impacts link-state advertisements in IGP routing, but that is
   alluded to elsewhere[5].)


4. What is Required?

   What is required to specify the nature of the desired LSP,
   therefore, is not merely the particular network layer (or
   technology) at which an LSP is established (currently captured in
   the LSP Encoding Type [2] field of the Label Request in the GMPLS
   draft), but also the particular signal type, within the technology
   represented by the LSP Encoding Type.  Thus, for the optical TDM
   case, it is not enough to merely know that the LSP is a SONET LSP,
   it is also imperative to know whether it is signal type STS-1 or
   VT1.5, since an LSP with signal type STS-1 cannot, for instance, be
   routed over a link that only has VT1.5 link connections available,
   even if the unused bandwidth exceeds that needed for an STS-1 signal
   type. Thus, what is required is a Signal Type field in addition to
   the LSP Encoding Type field, so that this new field can be used to
   identify (via appropriate rules), the specific link connections that
   can be used to carry this LSP over a link.

   Another element specifying the nature of the desired LSP is the
   extent, if any, of connection grouping, which is specified by a
   combination of two fields that denote respectively, the type of
   grouping requested by the LSP and the number of components in that
   grouping. For example, in optical TDM networks, a number of non-
   concatenated STS-1s that are routed together as a group (all
   contained within the same SONET line or WDM signal) receive
   essentially the same delay and propagation, so they are specified by
   a requested grouping type (RGT) field in GMPLS. This denotes how
   many connections of a given signal type are requested together, and
   helps to ensure that they meet similar routing constraints. Since
   the specific group routing constraints depend on technology, this
   parameter is interpreted in the context of the LSP Encoding Type
   field.

   Such grouping simplifies connection establishment (especially for
   batches of DS-3s that are being wholesaled) and speeds re-routes.
   The grouping of larger signals, i.e., groups of STS-Mc, lambdas,
   etc., is for further study.

   Finally, there is also a field that indicates the requested number
   of components (RNC), that is, the number of identical signal types

   that are requested to be grouped into an LSP, as specified in the
   RGT field.


5. A Discussion of the Refinements

   To summarize, the refinements proposed in this document are:

   i)   The introduction of a new field, that is interpreted in the
        context of the LSP Encoding Type field, and specifies the
        Signal Type of the LSP, allowing for an intermediate switch to
        decide which links are capable of supporting the requested LSP.

   ii)  A modification of the payload identifier field (the GPID), so
        that it is interpreted in the context of the LSP Encoding Type
        field. This tiered structure (as opposed to the flat structure
        in the current GMPLS specification) facilitates understanding
        and extensibility, by allowing for newer payload types for a
        particular technology to be added without conflict
        (coordination or confusion) with other technologies.


   iii) The introduction of an "Extra Traffic" code in the Link
        Protection Type/Flag field, which, in effect, realizes a
        service class that provides a level of reliability even lower
        than that achieved by the use of unprotected links at each hop.
        (Recall, that an LSP routed over "Extra Traffic" links could
        fail even if there is no fault on the links that this LSP is
        using, since an extra traffic link may be pressed into service
        when a corresponding working path has a fault.)

        We emphasize that the Link Protection Flag field is associated
        with  a link between two nodes, and reflects the participation
        of that link in some protection scheme. That is, it reflects
        how the link at a particular hop is protected or used in
        protection by a server layer or path layer protection
        mechanism. We have kept this as a distinct option, without
        mixing it with notions of pre-emption and priority (P&P) for
        the following reasons.

        LPF represents both a property of a link (advertised in
        routing) and a constraint on which links may be used for a
        given path (utilized in signaling).  In both uses, however, the
        LPT value indicates a property of a link that is derived from
        the server layer network providing that link or a path
        protection mechanism at the LSP layer.

   LSP Encoding Type: 8 bits

   Indicates the encoding technology of the LSP being requested.  The
   following shows permitted values and their meaning:

                 Value       Type
                 -----       ----
                   3         ANSI PDH
                   4         ETSI PDH
                   5         SDH
                   6         SONET

   The ANSI PDH and ETSI PDH types designate these respective
   networking technologies.  DS1 and DS3 are examples of ANSI PDH LSPs.
   An E1 LSP would be ETSI PDH.  The SDH and SONET types designate
   synchronous TDM multiplexing technologies.  VT1.5 and STS-1 are
   examples of SONET LSPs.  SDH LSP types include VC-12, VC-4, etc.

   NOTE: The following encodings are an example of how Signal Type, G-
   PID, etc. encoding might be done for PDH, SDH, and SONET.  A
   specific encoding proposal will be provided after these and other
   possible encodings are considered.

   The "STM-N MS" and "STM-N RS" Signal types represent transparent STM
   Multiplex Section and Regenerator Section LSPs respectively.  Simply
   "STM-N" signifies path layer transparency, that is, the set of AUs
   contained within the STM-N taken as a group (equivalent to AUG-N).
   These are defined for the standard values of N (1, 4, 16, 64, 256).

   The group Signal Types (TUG-2, TUG-3, STM-N) signify that the entire
   contents of the group are to be connected.  This requires that
   proper pointer processing be done for each constituent of the group,
   according to the contents of the pointers present in the LSP.

   Generalized PID (G-PID): 16 bits

   An identifier of the payload carried by an LSP, i.e. an identifier
   of the client layer of that LSP.  This must be interpreted according
   to LSP Encoding Type and is used by the nodes at the endpoints of
   the LSP.  Standard Ethertype values are used for packet and Ethernet
   LSPs; other values are:

   Link Protection Flags: 8 bits

   The Link Protection Flag field,  carried in the label request
   message,  is a vector of flags indicating the protection level(s)
   that the LSP desires for the links at each hop along its path. It
   is, therefore, distinct from MPLS-level protection (see 7), which
   involves protection of the actual LSP (which may be done either end-
   to-end, via path-based protection, or locally. A value of 0 implies
   that this connection does not care about which, if any, link
   protection is used.  More than one bit may be set to indicate when
   multiple protection types are acceptable.  When multiple bits are
   set and multiple protection types are available, the choice of
   protection type is a local (policy)decision.

   The following flags are defined:

   0x01  Extra Traffic

   Indicates that links that are reserved for automatic recovery in
   case of a fault elsewhere in the network may be used for this LSP.
   Observe that this means that the LSP can be disrupted whenever such
   a link is needed for its assigned recovery purpose. In other words,
   the LSP can be dropped even if there is no fault on the links along
   which this LSP is routed.

   0x02  Unprotected

   "Unprotected" indicates that unprotected links may be used by this
   LSP. This means that the LSP will only lose service on this hop, if
   there is a fault along this particular link (a fault elsewhere will
   not affect this link, and therefore will not affect this LSP). In
   other words, "unprotected" can be regarded as a "neutral" form of
   protection. The LSP does not lose service as long as the link is up,
   but loses service once this link goes down, since the link itself is
   not protected by a backup link.

   0x04  Shared

   Indicates that protected working links, whose protection resources
   are shared among some number, say N,  of working links may be used
   by this LSP.

   This means that if there is a fault along this particular link, the
   LSP will lose service on this hop, only if the backup link is
   already in use by traffic from one of the remaining N-1 working
   links (due to an earlier fault on one of those links). Thus, the
   "shared" option can be regarded as a better form of protection,
   since the LSP is protected as long as there is no fault on any of
   the remaining N-1 working links that share the same backup link.


   0x08  Dedicated

   Indicates that links with dedicated protection, e.g., 1:1 or 1+1
   protection, may be used by this LSP.

draft-mack-crane-gmpls-signaling-enhancements-00.txt      November 2000



   This means that a protection link is reserved for the working link
   over which this LSP is routed, so that this LSP is always protected
   against any fault on its working link. Thus, the "dedicated" option
   offers a higher form of link-level protection.


   0x10  Enhanced

   Indicates that links that are multiply protected, such as via a ring
   switch and a span switch in a 4-fiber BLSR/MS-SPRING, may be used by
   this LSP.

   Thus, the LPFs represent a constraint on which links may be used for
   a given path (which is signaled during connection setup as specified
   above).


   Requested Grouping Type (RGT): 4 bits

   This field indicates the type of grouping requested for the LSP.
   A number of Signal Type connections may be requested with certain
   routing constraints.  The specific group routing constraints may
   depend on the technology, so this field is interpreted in the
   context of LSP Encoding Type.

    The values for SONET and SDH are defined in the following table:

                 Value       Grouping Type
                 -----       ----------------------------------
                   0         No Grouping
                   1         Co-routed group
                   2         Virtual concatenation
                   3         Contiguous standard concatenation
                   4         Contiguous arbitrary concatenation

   For a co-routed group, all components in the group must be routed
   via the same higher order container.  Virtual concatenation requires
   co-routing and implies a bonding function at the endpoints of the
   group.  For contiguous standard concatenation, there must be a
   standard number of components (4, 16, 64, etc. for SDH; 3, 12, 48,
   etc. for SONET), and they must be in one higher order container.
   For contiguous arbitrary concatenation, the number of components is
   arbitrary (2, 3, 4, ‡) and they still must be routed in one higher
   order container.

   Requested Number of Components (RNC): 16 bits

   This field indicates the number of identical signal types that are
   requested to be grouped in that LSP, as specified in the previous
   field.  It is assumed that all these components have identical
   characteristics. This field is set to zero if no grouping is
   requested.

7. Rationale for the General Applicability of these Refinements

   As seen from the explanations in the preceding sections, the
   refinements introduced in this draft are not specific to the optical
   TDM layer alone. The notion of a Signal Type is general, and will be
   needed in optical WDM networks, at least to distinguish between
   different wavelength spacings, by charaterizing a signal by its
   center frequency (see [5], for example). Of course, the optical WDM
   technolgoies, being new, do not yet have all the requisite standards
   in place, which makes it even more imperative that the encodings
   defined in the GMPLS work be flexible, extensible, and applicable to
   various technologies.

   Likewise, the notion of "Extra Traffic," which is a common one in
   optical TDM networks, we believe has more general applicability.
   Since LPF represents a property of a link, it can, be used in a
   recursive way in multi-layer networks.

   The RGT and RNC are similarly general concepts, since the notion of
   co-routed groups can easily apply to other layers, such as the
   optical WDM layer. Also, this method of establishing co-routed
   groups has some advantages over doing LSP setup repeatedly for all
   the components in a co-routed group (and giving them the same ERO),
   because it eliminates the scenario where some components get blocked
   due to resource contention from other requests that arrive at the
   intermediate nodes while the various components of the co-routed
   group are still be set up. Furthermore, it allows for a switch to
   locally route the groups in an identical way (via the same
   interfaces, ports, etc.), which has benefits for protection and
   recovery.

   As such, the refinements proposed in this document, while
   illustrated in the context of optical TDM networks, are general
   enough for adoption in the label request of the GMPLS specification.
   Below we give two suggestions for how these might be incorporated in
   GMPLS.

8. Proposed Options for the Adoption of the Refinements

   There are two options for the adoption of these refinements. The
   first option is for the label request in GMPLS to be enhanced to the
   format specified in this document. Operators or users that do not
   require certain fields can simply set the associated bits to a
   "don∆t care" value. This requires no other changes to the GMPLS
   signaling specification, and is in conformance with the
   specification of the bandwidth value for an LSP in the T-Spec object
   in RSVP and in an appropriate bandwidth TLV in CR-LDP.  It also has
   the advantages of not requiring further C-types (per technology) for
   the Label Request object, and allow for a general label request
   object, while still allowing the flexibility for technology-specific
   variations, where needed.

draft-mack-crane-gmpls-signaling-enhancements-00.txt      November 2000



   The second option is to simply adopt the refined label request
   encoding for the SONET/SDH/PDH GMPLS label request (with C-type 5).
   As shown in this document, in that case values that are not relavant
   for the optical TDM layer (for example, digital wrapper, lambda, or
   fiber) should be eliminated from the LSP Encoding Type, Signal Type
   and GPID. Likewise, values corresponding to the optical TDM layer
   would have to be removed from the label request object, C-type 4,
   currently defined in the GMPLS draft, so that there is always only
   one way to encode the label request for a given network layer or
   given LSP Encoding Type.


9. Security Considerations

   This draft raises no new security issues in the GMPLS
   specifications.
