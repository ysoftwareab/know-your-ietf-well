                   Routing Key Chain YANG Data Model
                 draft-ietf-rtgwg-yang-key-chain-24.txt

Abstract

   This document describes the key chain YANG data model.  Key chains
   are commonly used for routing protocol authentication and other
   applications requiring symmetric keys.  A key chain is a list of
   elements each containing a key string, send lifetime, accept
   lifetime, and algorithm (authentication or encryption).  By properly
   overlapping the send and accept lifetimes of multiple key chain
   elements, key strings and algorithms may be gracefully updated.  By
   representing them in a YANG data model, key distribution can be
   automated.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the key chain YANG [YANG-1.1] data model.
   Key chains are commonly used for routing protocol authentication and
   other applications requiring symmetric keys.  A key chain is a list
   of elements each containing a key string, send lifetime, accept
   lifetime, and algorithm (authentication or encryption).  By properly

   overlapping the send and accept lifetimes of multiple key chain
   elements, key strings and algorithms may be gracefully updated.  By
   representing them in a YANG data model, key distribution can be
   automated.

   In some applications, the protocols do not use the key chain element
   key directly, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive
   a short-lived key from the key chain element key (e.g., the Master
   Keys used in [TCP-AO]).

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC-KEYWORDS].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the complete data tree is
   presented in Section 3.3.  The following tree notation is used.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose YANG list keys.  These YANG list keys
      should not be confused with the key-chain keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), "ro" state data (read-only), "-x" RPC operations,
      and "-n" notifications.

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!" a
      container with presence, and "*" denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Problem Statement

   This document describes a YANG [YANG-1.1] data model for key chains.
   Key chains have been implemented and deployed by a large percentage
   of network equipment vendors.  Providing a standard YANG model will
   facilitate automated key distribution and non-disruptive key

   rollover.  This will aid in tightening the security of the core
   routing infrastructure as recommended in [IAB-REPORT].

   A key chain is a list containing one or more elements containing a
   Key ID, key string, send/accept lifetimes, and the associated
   authentication or encryption algorithm.  A key chain can be used by
   any service or application requiring authentication or encryption
   using symmetric keys.  In essence, the key-chain is a reusable key
   policy that can be referenced wherever it is required.  The key-chain
   construct has been implemented by most networking vendors and
   deployed in many networks.

   A conceptual representation of a crypto key table is described in
   [CRYPTO-KEYTABLE].  The crypto key table also includes keys as well
   as their corresponding lifetimes and algorithms.  Additionally, the
   key table includes key selection criteria and envisions a deployment
   model where the details of the applications or services requiring
   authentication or encryption permeate into the key database.  The
   YANG key-chain model described herein doesn't include key selection
   criteria or support this deployment model.  At the same time, it does
   not preclude it.  The draft [YANG-CRYPTO-KEYTABLE] describes
   augmentations to the key chain YANG model in support of key selection
   criteria.

2.1.  Applicability

   Other YANG modules may reference ietf-key-chain YANG module key-chain
   names for authentication and encryption applications.  A YANG type
   has been provided to facilitate reference to the key-chain name
   without having to specify the complete YANG XML Path Language (XPath)
   selector.

2.2.  Graceful Key Rollover using Key Chains

   Key chains may be used to gracefully update the key string and/or
   algorithm used by an application for authentication or encryption.
   To achieve graceful key rollover, the receiver MAY accept all the
   keys that have a valid accept lifetime and the sender MAY send the
   key with the most recent send lifetime.  One scenario for
   facilitating key rollover is to:

   1.  Distribute a key chain with a new key to all the routers or other
       network devices in the domain of that key chain.  The new key's
       accept lifetime should be such that it is accepted during the key
       rollover period.  The send lifetime should be a time in the
       future when it can be assured that all the routers in the domain
       of that key are upgraded.  This will have no immediate impact on
       the keys used for transmission.

Internet-Draft               YANG Key Chain                   April 2017


   2.  Assure that all the network devices have been updated with the
       updated key chain and that their system times are roughly
       synchronized.  The system times of devices within an
       administrative domain are commonly synchronized (e.g., using
       Network Time Protocol (NTP) [NTP-PROTO]).  This also may be
       automated.

   3.  When the send lifetime of the new key becomes valid, the network
       devices within the domain of key chain will using the new key for
       transmissions.

   4.  At some point in the future, a new key chain with the old key
       removed may be distributed to the network devices within the
       domain of the key chain.  However, this may be deferred until the
       next key rollover.  If this is done, the key chain will always
       include two keys; either the current and future key (during key
       rollovers) or the current and previous keys (between key
       rollovers).

   Since the most recent send lifetime is defined as the one with the
   latest start-time, specification of "always" will prevent using the
   graceful key rollover technique described above.  Other key
   configuration and usage scenarios are possible but these are beyond
   the scope of this document.

3.  Design of the Key Chain Model

   The ietf-key-chain module contains a list of one or more keys indexed
   by a Key ID.  For some applications (e.g., OSPFv3 [OSPFV3-AUTH]), the
   Key ID is used to identify the key chain key to be used.  In addition
   to the Key ID, each key chain key includes a key-string and a
   cryptographic algorithm.  Optionally, the key chain keys include
   send/accept lifetimes.  If the send/accept lifetime is unspecified,
   the key is always considered valid.

   Note that different key values for transmission versus acceptance may
   be supported with multiple key chain elements.  The key used for
   transmission will have a valid send-lifetime and invalid accept-
   lifetime (e.g., has an end-time equal to the start-time).  The key
   used for acceptance will have a valid accept-lifetime and invalid
   send-lifetime.

   Due to the differences in key chain implementations across various
   vendors, some of the data elements are optional.  Finally, the crypto
   algorithm identities are provided for reuse when configuring legacy
   authentication and encryption not using key-chains.

   A key-chain is identified by a unique name within the scope of the
   network device.  The "key-chain-ref" typedef SHOULD be used by other
   YANG modules when they need to reference a configured key-chain.

3.1.  Key Chain Operational State

   The key chain operational state is included in the same tree as key
   chain configuration consistent with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture [NMDA].  The timestamp of the last key chain
   modification is also maintained in the operational state.
   Additionally, the operational state includes an indication of whether
   or not a key chain key is valid for sending or acceptance.

3.2.  Key Chain Model Features

   Features are used to handle differences between vendor
   implementations.  For example, not all vendors support configuration
   of an acceptance tolerance or configuration of key strings in
   hexadecimal.  They are also used to support of security requirements
   (e.g., TCP-AO Algorithms [TCP-AO-ALGORITHMS]) not yet implemented by
   vendors or only a single vendor.

   It is common for an entity with sufficient permissions to read and
   store a device's configuration which would include the contents of
   this model.  To avoid unnecessarily seeing and storing the keys in
   clear-text, this model provides the aes-key-wrap feature.  More
   details are described in Security Considerations Section 5.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [NETCONF] or
   RESTCONF [RESTCONF].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
   transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   Secure Shell (SSH) [NETCONF-SSH].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is
   HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [TLS].

   The NETCONF access control model [NETCONF-ACM] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.  The key strings are not accessible by
   default and NETCONF Access Control Mode [NETCONF-ACM] rules are
   required to configure or retrieve them.

   When configured, the key-strings can be encrypted using the AES Key
   Wrap algorithm [AES-KEY-WRAP].  The AES key-encryption key (KEK) is
   not included in the YANG model and must be set or derived independent
   of key-chain configuration.  When AES key-encryption is used, the
   hex-key-string feature is also required since the encrypted keys will
   contain characters that are not representable in the YANG string
   built-in type [YANG-1.1].  It is RECOMMENDED that key-strings be
   encrypted using AES key-encryption to prevent key-chains from being
   retrieved and stored with the key-strings in clear text.  This
   recommendation is independent of the access protection that is
   availed from the NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [NETCONF-ACM].

   The clear-text algorithm is included as a YANG feature.  Usage is NOT
   RECOMMENDED except in cases where the application and device have no
   other alternative (e.g., a legacy network device that must
   authenticate packets at intervals of 10 milliseconds or less for many
   peers using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection [BFD]).  Keys used
   with the clear-text algorithm are considered insecure and SHOULD NOT
   be reused with more secure algorithms.

   Similarly, the MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms have been proven to be
   insecure ([Dobb96a], [Dobb96b], and [SHA-SEC-CON]) and usage is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Usage should be confined to deployments where it is
   required for backward compatibility.

   Implementations with keys provided via this model should store them
   using best current security practices.
