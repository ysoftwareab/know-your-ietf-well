Abstract

    The Universal Forms Description Language (UFDL) describes complex
    business forms for use over the Internet. The objective of the UFDL
    is to enable the creation of cross-platform Internet business forms
    that (1) contain both the complex logic and precise layout that
    administrators require, (2) are simple to maintain and distribute,
    and (3) integrate easily with existing business systems. As more
    and more business is done over the Internet, the need for a form
    description language that incorporates these features grows. HTML
    is designed for Internet pages, and is severely limited as a form
    language. This document specifies the vocabulary, syntax, and
    meaning of the UFDL.

    This document specifies the Universal Forms Description Language
    (UFDL), which describes complex business forms for use over the
    Internet. The objective of the UFDL is to enable the creation of
    cross-platform Internet business forms that (1) contain both the
    complex logic and precise layout that administrators require, (2)
    are simple to maintain and distribute, and (3) integrate easily with
    existing business systems. This document specifies the vocabulary,
    syntax, and meaning of the UFDL.

    Since more and more business is being done over the Internet, the
    need for a form description language that incorporates the
    complexities of business systems is growing. Typically, an
    electronic business form is part of a process-intensive
    administration system. Users or server modules populate forms with
    data, the forms are distributed according to a work flow plan, and
    the data is stored in a database (or, in departments that have no
    complete electronic solution, the form is printed for storage). The
    forms, which can contain hundreds of input items, need to validate
    the data they receive, perform calculations and other logical
    operations, and integrate with existing data management systems.

Universal Forms Description Language                            [page 4]


    Today, most Internet forms are inadequate and are being created with
    HTML.

    HTML is designed for the easy display of Internet pages. As a
    result, HTML is very good at creating the layout for web sites and
    has become the standard for web pages. Web designers and IS
    organizations are now trying to push HTML beyond what it was
    intended to do. HTML forms work well for collecting basic
    information over the Internet. However, most business forms are much
    more complex than the typical HTML order form.

    HTML was not designed to collect, validate, manipulate, or store
    information. In order to build significant intelligence into an HTML
    form, a developer has to use JavaScript. Business forms also may
    need to travel through nodes in distribution chains, being viewed or
    changed by people along the way. HTML forms submit merely the data
    they've collected-the user interface and intelligence don't
    accompany it, and so make it difficult to create a workflow system
    for the form. HTML forms also have a fairly inflexible layout, and
    it's impossible to create precise, complex HTML forms and print them
    the way people are used to.

    The UFDL was designed specifically for Internet business forms. It
    describes all components of a complex form: user interface,
    intelligent features, and input data. A UFDL form can be transmitted
    whole or in part from node to node in a distribution chain. The
    UFDL's precise layout specifications allow users to create and print
    forms that replicate the paper forms they're used to. The UFDL
    includes complex business logic so that intelligent features like
    user-input checking, calculations, and in-form decisions are part of
    the form itself, rather than a separate script, and travel with the
    form to the next user. The UFDL allows developers to extend the
    language to interface with other applications by adding their own
    customized information to forms. The syntax of the UFDL is
    high-level and easy to learn, but at the same time incorporates the
    logic needed for business transactions. C and Java programmers will
    recognize many features of the syntax.


    1.2 UFDL Documentation 

    This section outlines how this document is organized, and directs
    readers to other documents on the Universal Forms Description
    Language for further information.

    1.2a How This Document is Organized

    The UFDL Specification is intended both for an academic audience
    and for form developers and people writing applications that use
    UFDL forms.
        
    For an introduction to the language and its elements, see Part 2:
    Introduction to the Universal Forms Description Language. It 
    explains the concepts behind the UFDL and specifies the components
    of a UFDL form. It delineates the UFDL syntax and explains the 

Universal Forms Description Language                            [page 5]


    language elements.
        
    For a full description of form global settings, form items, form
    options, and directives for form viewers, see parts 2, 3, 4, and 5.
        
    For the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of the UFDL, see 'Appendix A:  
    Grammar of the UFDL'.  C Programmers may find it useful to review
    'Appendix B: UFDL for C and C++ Programmers'.

    1.2b Other UFDL Documentation

    Those who want a hands-on introduction to making UFDL forms may
    want to download the Guide to Making UFDL Forms. It contains 
    tutorials for making a simple form and for making a multiple-page
    form that contains advanced features, like decision logic, error
    checking and formatting, time-saving features, and more.
        
    Those who want to find out more about the grammar behind the UFDL
    may want to view or download the Lexical and Syntactical
    Specification for the UFDL.
        
    Both of these documents are available at http://www.uwi.com/UFDL

1.3 Requirement Levels for UFDL Elements

    This specification does not contain extraneous material, and
    therefore most implementers of the UFDL will want to include all
    elements specified here. However, not all elements are required,
    though all are suggested.
    This section specifies which elements are REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, and
    OPTIONAL in an implementation. The criterion for determining whether
    an element of the language is REQUIRED is whether the exclusion of
    the element would prevent people from filling and transmitting the
    form.
    Unless specified in the list below, all elements are REQUIRED. An
    implementation that does not include an element MUST interoperate
    with another implementation that does include the element (though
    perhaps with reduced functionality). In the same vein, an
    implementation that does include the element MUST interoperate
    with one that does not (except, of course, for the feature the
    element provides). Also, before deciding to ignore an element that
    is RECOMMENDED, an implementor must understand the implications
    of not including the element.
    RECOMMENDED Elements (Elements that implementors SHOULD include)
      - bgcolor option
      - fontcolor option
      - labelbgcolor option
      - labelfontcolor option
      - next option
      - previous option
      - printsettings option
    OPTIONAL Elements (Elements that implementors MAY include)
      - help item

      - bordercolor option

Universal Forms Description Language                            [page 6]


      - borderwidth option
      - help option
      - labelbordercolor option
      - labelborderwidth option
 
      - #include directive
    Note: For a definition of the words REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL,
    MUST, SHOULD, and MAY as used in this section, see RFC 2119.

    1.4 Implied Semantics for UFDL Viewers

    There are a few behaviors that are "implied" but not explicit in
   the UFDL, and that are defining features of the UFDL. This section
    outlines those behaviors, and should be considered part of the UFDL
    Specification.
    Temporary Files
      A viewer that uses UFDL forms may create temporary files in the 
      following locations:
          - web browser's temp directory
          - Windows temp directory
          - viewer's temp directory
      A viewer MUST NOT create temporary files in any other location
      on a user's computer. This prevents system files or permanent
      user files from being at risk if they're not in temp directories.
      A viewer may delete files from the three temporary directories
      listed above at its discretion, but it MUST delete ONLY files that
      are older than the last reboot of the operating system, or that it
      can positively identify as one of its own temporary files.
      The following UFDL form events may cause a UFDL viewer to create
      and/or delete temporary files: Opening a form; Closing a form;
      Submitting a form (a transaction of type "submit" or "done");
      Emailing a form (if a viewer supports emailing forms); Enclosing
      files; Displaying enclosures.
    Permanent Files
      Certain UFDL form operations require a viewer to read or create
      permanent files. They are: Enclosing a File; Extracting a File;
      and Saving a form. Only button and cell items can initiate these
      operations. Automatic actions MUST NOT initiate actions that
      create permanent files on a user's computer.
      When a viewer performs an enclose, extract, or save operation, it
      MUST conform to the restrictions that follow.
      Enclosures: When the user activates an enclose button or cell, the
      viewer must prompt the user with a file browser so that the user
      can choose which file to enclose. This file browser must allow the
      user to cancel the enclose transaction without writing the
      enclosure into the form. Users may choose to enclose any files to
      which their operating system gives them access.
      Extractions: When the user activates an extract button or cell,
      the viewer must prompt the user with a file browser so that the
      user may choose both a location and a name for the file that's
      being extracted. Other than the usual restrictions on file names
      that the user's operating system imposes, the viewer must not
      restrict the file name the user chooses. If the user specifies a
      file name that already exists, then the viewer must warn the user
      that it exists, and ask the user whether to overwrite the existing

Universal Forms Description Language                            [page 7]


      file. The user must be able to cancel the extract operation before
      the viewer has written the permanent file.
      Saves: When the user activates a save button or cell, the viewer
      must prompt the user with a file browser so that the user may
      choose both a location and a name for the saved form. (Save acts
      like "Save As".) Other than the usual restrictions on file names
      that the user's operating system imposes, the viewer must not
      restrict the file name the user chooses. If there is already a
      file with the file name that the user specifies, then the viewer
      must warn the user that it exists, and ask the user whether to
      overwrite the existing file. The viewer must allow the user to
      cancel the save operation before the viewer has written the
     permanent file.
    These rules have been created in order to allow users to perform the
    enclosures, extractions, and saves necessary when completing
    business forms, while at the same time protecting their computers by
    (a) limiting temporary files to temp directories, and (b) preventing
    uploads and downloads that users are not aware of.

    1.5 Security Considerations

    The UFDL specifies the description of a form, but not the transport
    protocol for transmitting it. Any trasmission security issues that
    exist for the transport protocol submitting the form (for example,
    those used by mail programs and web browsers) exist when
    transmitting a UFDL form. (Note, however, that UFDL forms can be
    compressed using a compression algorithm before they are submitted.
    For more information, see the transmitformat option description.)

    UFDL forms cannot invoke programs on local computer drives. In
    addition, a UFDL viewer must save temporary files to standard
    temp directories only, as outlined in '1.4 Implied Semantics' above.
    A UFDL Viewer may only read and write permament files under strict
    conditions and then only with the user's knowledge (through
    presenting a file browser); see '1.4 Implied Semantics' for more
    information.

    1.6 Responding to Errors in the Form Description

    Any UFDL form interpreter must parse a UFDL form for non-compliance
    to the UFDL specification. This debugger should treat
    non-compliances in the following manner:

    Flag as Warnings - All item types and option types that are not part
    of the UFDL. These must be flagged as warnings and not as errors
    because the UFDL allows developers to create custom items and
    options for inserting application-specific information into forms.
    Forms containing non-compliances that generate warning messages may
    still be displayed. The non-compliances must be ignored when
    displaying the form, and the defaults used instead (if applicable).
    A UFDL Viewer may implement a mechanism that allows users to turn
    off the warning messages.

    Flag as Errors - Anything that might (but also might not) adversely
    affect the appearance or functionality of the form. Forms that

Universal Forms Description Language                            [page 8]


    contain non-compliances that might affect the appearance or
    functionality of the form may be displayed. The non-compliances
    must be ignored, and the defaults (if applicable) must be used
    when displaying the form.

    Flag as Fatal Errors - Anything that will adversely affect the
    appearance or functionality of the form. Forms containing
    non-compliances that generate fatal error messages must not be
    displayed.

    In addition, the UFDL debugger must check the version number of the
    form it parses. The version number denotes which version of the UFDL
    specification the form complies with. The parser must check for
    non-compliances based on the version of the UFDL that the form was
    written with. This provides backwards compatibility.

2.   Introduction to the Universal Forms Description Language

   2.1  What is the UFDL?

Summary
    The Universal Forms Description Language (UFDL) is a language that
    describes complex electronic business forms much the way HTML
    describes web pages. It is cross-platform, easy to learn, and its
    features are tailored to business needs.

    Note:  Because UFDL version 4.0 includes the start value element in
    an option name, any code written to work with the UFDL BNF version
    3.3.1 or earlier will not be able to parse a version 4.0 form.

Details
    The UFDL is a platform-independent, high-level language that
    describes electronic business forms. It was designed specifically
    for creating forms that are capable of replacing paper forms
    systems. That is, it creates forms that:
    
    - Create auditable records, by viewing a form as an object that
      includes layout instructions and data, and that can be passed
      whole from node to node in a distribution chain, archived, and
      retrieved later for verification.
    - Let users work offline or online.
    - Perform logical operations.
    - Give users editing and error checking tools.
    - Allow users to digitally sign the whole form or parts of the
      form.
    - Appear the same on any platform and under any screen resolution
      and system font size.
    - Interface with other applications.
  
    The UFDL incorporates the following design concepts:

    Familiar Syntax
    The UFDL is easy to pick up, because it is syntactically similar to

Universal Forms Description Language                            [page 9]


    two industry standard programming languages: C++ and Java. Here is
    the description of a very simple UFDL form:

version = "3.2.0";
page_1 = new page
{
  body_label = new label
  {
    value = "This is a UFDL form.";
    }
 }
    Essentially, the form consists of one or more pages. A page
    contains zero or more items, like the label item in the example
    above. The items can be made from item types that are part of the
    UFDL (labels, buttons, fields, automatic actions and so on), or
    from item types form designers create themselves. Pages and item
    types have certain default characteristics that form developers can
    modify by specifying various options.

    Declarative Language

    Statements in a UFDL form description are always maintained as
    being true, much as formula fields in a spreadsheet are maintained
    as true. The simplest example of this is a total field that adds up
    the contents of various dollar fields in a form. If one of the
    dollar fields changes,so does the total field.
 
    What makes the UFDL different from languages like C++ and Java in
    this respect is that the constant evaluation of dependencies is
    inherent in the language. A UFDL form requires no special
    procedures to be written in order to run evaluations; the
    evaluations run automatically whenever dependent data changes.

    Extensible Syntax

    The UFDL was designed to be easily extensible for both form
    developersand the creators of the UFDL.
    -  Form developers can create their own item and option types
       within forms (although currently they cannot set up inherited
       attributes for each type they create).
    -  The authors of the UFDL can add new features to each new version
       of the UFDL.
    
    Open Protocol

    The UFDL is an open protocol. This gives developers the freedom to
    manipulate UFDL forms any way they want. Scripts can be written to
    dynamically create forms, modify forms, or extract specific
    information from forms. UFDL forms can themselves make requests to
    databases and populate themselves with the information returned.
    This flexibility allows developers to integrate UFDL forms into any
    application.

    People with knowledge of C or C++ may wish to refer to Appendix C:
    UFDL for C and C++ Programmers. This appendix outlines the UFDL's

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 10]


    similarities to those languages.
------

   2.2  Features of UFDL Forms

    A UFDL form looks and behaves just the way you imagine an
    electronic form should. It can contain graphical elements,
    modifiable fields, and action items. You can organize a UFDL form
    into pages similar to the pages in a paper form and you can include
    navigational aids such as toolbars, tabbing instructions, and
    scroll bars. In addition, you can code the form to make logical
    decisions, to interface with otherapplications, and to
    automatically format and check user's entries.

    A desktop form viewer application displays the forms. This UFDL
    form viewer allows users to enter input, enclose and view external
    files, and print and save forms. When it is convenient, the user
    can perform a simple action, such as pressing a button, to submit
    the completed form to an application for processing.

    Some of the features that make UFDL forms ideal for every-day
    business use are outlined here.

Versatile Form Design

    The UFDL is very versatile. It provides many features you can use
    to customize both the appearance and functionality of your form.

    Absolute and Relational Positioning Schemes

    The UFDL supports both an absolute positioning scheme and a
    relational positioning scheme. The absolute positioning scheme
    allows a form designer to place visible form items in fixed
    locations on a form. This is useful for beginners and for GUI
    design applications that use a drag-and-drop method for designing
    forms. But an absolute positioning scheme is not a cross-platform
    solution. Used in conjunction with relational positioning, however,
    it can create modularized blocks of a form that can be easily moved
    around.

    The UFDL's relational positioning scheme allows designers to create
    forms that appear the same on any platform. It aligns visual
    elements in relation to other visual elements on the form, ensuring
    forms look consistent on all computers and at all screen
    resolutions. If an item changes size-either to accommodate a
    dynamically created value or a system font size-items aligned to it
    will shift in relation to it. This relational positioning scheme is
    flexible, giving developers freedom to create original layouts.

    Support for User-Defined Objects

    The UFDL lets designers define their own form objects. These
    objects have no visible properties and initiate no actions, which
    means that form developers can store specialized information in the
    form without harming its appearance or behavior. A form viewer
    application respects references to custom objects in the form

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 11]


    definition, allowing a custom object to accumulate information and
    also allowing other elements in the form to be altered according to
    the custom object's contents.

Input and Format Control

    The UFDL permits form designers to specify an item's availability,
    edit state, and input and output formats. This means the form can
    perform much of the data checking and formatting typically
    performed by form processing applications.

Digital Signatures

    Version 4.0 and higher of UFDL supports digital signatures, for
    secure, tamper-proof documents. Digital signatures are incorporated
    into the description of the form, and allow the developer to
    specify that a user may sign the entire form or parts of the form.
    In addition, multiple users may sign a form.

Automatic Actions

    The UFDL supports automatic timed behavior activated by the form.
    Forms can automatically cancel themselves, submit themselves to a 
    server for processing, open new forms, and upload information to a
    server.

    The ability to perform automatic actions provides a mechanism that
    form designers can use to create stated connections with other
    applications. An application typically requiring a stated
    connection is a database\management system.

Logical Operations and Arithmetic Computations

    The UFDL uses a set of options to describe a form object's
    appearance and behavior. For example, the option bgcolor describes
    an object's background color. The UFDL permits form designers to
    use literal values or logically computed values (called
    computations) to determine the value of an option.

    These computations are resolved when the form appears. You can nest
    computations, employ complex mathematical operations, populate and
    use arrays, and make decisions.

    Computations provide designers with a very powerful and
    sophisticated tool for customizing forms to the needs of individual
    users and applications. It takes very little code (one line per
    logical computation) and it allows decisions regarding a form's
    appearance and behavior to occur at run-time.

Stand Alone Definitions

    All aspects of a form's appearance, behavior, and content are
    integral to the form definition. Therefore, unless you specify
    otherwise, the entire form definition and the user data travel with
    the form when a user submits it for processing. Consequently, you
    can transmit any UFDL form to any site with a UFDL-compliant form

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 12]


    viewer application and the viewer will display the form correctly.
 
    The only exception to this rule occurs when the form design
    specifies partial submission of forms. The UFDL permits form
    designers to specify partial submissions in one of two ways:
    -  by specifying which parts to transmit
    -  by specifying HTML format

    Partial submissions help reduce network traffic and transmission
    time.
    
Context Sensitive Help

    The UFDL provides a mechanism whereby form designers can define
    help messages for individual items in the form. Help messages
    appear in a window overlaying the form.

Enclosures

    Users can enclose external files in UFDL forms. They can organize
    the files into folders, and they can display, copy, or remove the
    files. Enclosed files are encoded using the base64 encoding
    technique.

    The UFDL includes a MIME type with an enclosed file's description.
    This allows form viewer applications to choose an appropriate
    viewer (for example, World Wide Web browser, word processor, etc.)
    when displaying enclosures.
------

   2.3  Description of a UFDL Form

    A UFDL form is a collection of items (for example, buttons, labels,
    amd fields) organized into pages. There are items to display fixed
    values, items to collect user input, items to initiate actions, and
    items to assist with form navigation. The decision about which
    items to place on a page and how many pages to include in the form
    is application dependent.
    
    The UFDL provides a set of options for assigning characteristics to
    the form and to its pages and items. These include such things as
    the behavior, appearance, and location of an item. The UFDL defines
    default settings for many of these options, or you can define your
    own settings in the form.
    The following example describes a simple two-page form:

    For information on the syntax rules of a form description, see
    'Syntax of the UFDL' on 2.4b.
------

   2.3a What is a Page?

    A form page is similar to a page in a paper form. Each page
    consists of its own set of items. You can place any number and type
    of items on a page. The number of items, their sizes, and their

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 13]


    locations determine the size of the page.

    In some senses, pages act like independent forms. They have their
    own size, appearance, toolbars, and characteristics. As well,
    relational positioning of the page's items is based solely on other
    items on the same page.

    The following example shows a page containing a label and a button:

    For more information on the syntax rules of a page description, see
    'Syntax of the UFDL' on 2.4b.
    
    Relational and Absolute Positioning

    The UFDL supports two positioning schemes for creating a page
    image: relational and absolute positioning. In the relational
    positioning scheme, each item's location depends on the location
    and size of one or more other items on the page. For example, a
    field might be below and slightly to the right of a label. A series
    of buttons might be placed to appear one after the other.

    In the absolute positioning scheme, each visible item is anchored
    to a particular coordinate on the page drawn on the computer screen.
    Each coordinate represents a distance in pixels from the top left
    corner of the page. In addition, a form designer using absolute
    positioning can offset items from other items.

    Absolute positioning is useful for graphic form design programs
    because it allows users to drag and drop items on a form. It is not
    a good cross-platform positioning scheme, although when used
    carefully in conjunction with relational positioning, it can be
    successful.

    Relational positioning provides cross-platform compatibility in
    UFDL form designs, because all visible items are placed relative to
    each other. Therefore, if any item's size changes because of a
    change in font size or a dynamically generated value, other items
    on the form will shift to accommodate it, while maintaining their
    positions relative to each other.

    For more information, see 'Item Placement' on 2.4f, and the
    item location option description, on .

    Toolbars

    The toolbar is a separate and fixed area at the top of a page. It
    functions much like a toolbar in a word processing application.
    Typically, you place items in the toolbar that you want users to
    see no matter what portion of the page they are viewing. Toolbars
    are optional and each page has its own toolbar.

    The toolbar and the remainder (or body) of the page operate
    independently of one another. Both are scrollable, and scrolling
    one does not scroll the other. The toolbar can also have different
    characteristics than the page body, and relational positioning of

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 14]


    toolbar items is based solely on other items on the same toolbar.
------

   2.3b What is an Item?

    Items are the basic elements of a page. Just as paper forms consist
    of items like lines, boxes, and instructions, UFDL forms consist of
    items like lines, boxes, text fields, labels, buttons, and so on.
    There are two categories of items:
    -  external
    -  internal or hidden
    
    A page can include both categories of items. 

    External items occupy space on the page. They can be either visible
    or invisible. Visible items are things users see like labels and
    buttons. Invisible items are things like spacers that create white
    space on the form.

    Internal items are invisible and occupy no space; instead they
    trigger form actions or store data used by other items. Action and
    data items are examples of internal items. An action item initiates
    a transmission, while a data item contains data stored in the form.

    Each type of item has default characteristics. For example, all
    fields will be a certain length and color unless the form developer
    specifies otherwise. A form developer can modify an item's default
    characteristics by adding options to its definition. For example,
    the field described below on the left would have a default
    appearance of 60 characters long and one row high (as well as
    having other default characteristics). On the right, the size
    option added to its description overrides that default size.

date_field = new field
{
}

date_field = new field
{
   size = ["20", "1"];
}
Field using default characteristics only
Modified size overriding the default size

    There are defaults for most item characteristics. If the defaults
    meet your requirements, an item definition may include only the
    instance identifier, a unique item tag. Instance identifiers are
    mandatory. They are critical to the relational positioning scheme.
    For that reason, the UFDL incorporates the identifier into the
    syntax of an item definition.

    An item's definition includes:
    -  An instance identifier (an item tag that uniquely identifies
       it).
    -  An open brace following the item declaration.
    -  A close brace at the end of the definition (after the options,

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 15]


       if there are any).
    -  Optional information giving the item characteristics, including
       its position on the page, graphical characteristics and size,
       initial value and edit state, and instructions for handling the
       item when the form is submitted. Because these characteristics
       are optional, the lines that specify them are called options.

    Here is a sample of an item description:

    For more information on the syntax rules of an item's description,
    see 2.4b 'Syntax of the UFDL'.
------

   2.3c What is an Option?

    An option defines one characteristic of a form, a page, or an item.
    There are options to specify each aspect of the appearance and
    behavior of your form. Some options apply to the entire form,
    others apply only to items, and still others apply to pages or
    items. The example below shows options giving characteristics to an
    entire form, to a page, and to a particular item.

version = "3.2.0";
bgcolor = ["ivory"];

page_1 = new page
{
...
page_1 = new page
{
bgcolor = ["seashell"];
bar_box = new box
{
...
bar_box = new box
{
bgcolor = ["black"];
size = ["60", "5"];
}
...


    Options that appear at the top of the form, like the example on the
    far left, are called global settings. They apply to the whole form.
    Options that appear at the top of a page, like the example in the
    center, are called page settings. They apply to the entire page.
    Page settings override any similar global settings-but only for the
    page on which they occur. Options within items, like the example on
    the far right, apply only to the item whose description they are in.
------

   2.3d Including External Files
   
    The UFDL #include statement allows you to include external files in
    your form definition much as you would include header files in a C

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 16]


    language source file. The form viewer application replaces the
    #include statement with the contents of the file you specify. The
    included file must reside in a secure include directory accessible
    to the form viewer application.

   2.3e  Unrecognized Items and Options

    User-Defined Items and Options and Newer UFDL Items and Options
    
    As a UFDL form viewer parses a form, it ignores items and options
    it does not recognize. This feature has a number of advantages.
    -  It allows a form designer to include items and options for new
       form viewer applications without affecting the form's behavior
       in other viewers.
    -  Form processing applications can use the custom items and
       options when processing the form. One example of a custom item
       might be an SQL query item the application uses to populate a
       response form.
    Unrecognized items and options include:
    -  User defined (or custom) items and options
    -  Items and options from releases of the UFDL that are newer than
       the user's form viewer application understands
------

   2.4  Syntax of the UFDL

   2.4a Basic Syntax Rules

    The basic syntax rules of the UFDL are:
    -  It is case sensitive.
    -  It ignores white space around and within statements.
    -  It permits multiple line statements.
    -  It permits multiple statements per line.
------

   2.4b Form Definition

    The syntax of a UFDL form definition is as follows:

<version definition statement>*
<option definitions for the form characteristics>
<page definition1>
...
<page definitionn>**

    -  mandatory statement. See 'version' on page 199 for the syntax of
       this statement.
    -  there is no limit placed on the number of page definitions in a
       form; however, every form must contain at least one page
       definition.

For example,

version = "3.2.0";
bgcolor = ["ivory"];
fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "10", "plain"];

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 17]



//This is page 1
page_1 = new page
{
   <option definitions for the page settings>
   <item definitions for items located on page 1>
}

//This is page 2
page_2 = new page
{
   <option definitions for the page settings>
   <item definitions for items located on page 2>
}
...

//This is page 10
page_10 = new page
{
   <option definitions for the page settings>
   <item definitions for items located on page 10>
}

    Defining global settings for the form is optional. It has the
    effect of setting characteristics that apply to the entire form. In
    the previous example, version, bgcolor, and fontcolor are global
    settings. These characteristics override the defaults defined by
    the UFDL. Specific pages and items will override these global
    settings if the same option has been defined differently for that
    page or item.
------

   2.4c Page Definition

    The syntax of a page definition is as follows:
<page tag> = new page
{
   <option definitions for the page characteristics>
   <item definition1>
   ...
   <item definitionn>
}

    Notes:

    i)   The braces are mandatory. 
    ii)  A page definition must begin on a new line.
    iii) Item definitions are optional and there is no limit placed on
         the number of item definitions in a page.

    The page tag uniquely identifies a page instance. No two page tags
    in a form can be the same. See the section 'Identifiers' on page 35
    for tag naming conventions.

    Defining page characteristics is optional. It has the effect of

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 18]


    setting options that are global to that page. These characteristics
    override the defaults defined by the UFDL and any global options
    set by the form characteristics. Specific items will override the
    page settings if the same option has been defined differently for
    that item.

    In the following example, you can see a sample page definition. The
    page tag is Page_one and the page contains a label and a button.
    The page has a background color of cornsilk and each item on the
    page will have a font of Times 14.

Page_one = new page
{
   bgcolor = ["cornsilk"];
   fontinfo = ["Times", "14", "plain"];
   button_label = new label
   {
       <option definitions for the label characteristics>
   }
   save_button = new button
   {
      <option definitions for the button characteristics>  
   }
}
------

   2.4d Item Definition

    The syntax of an item definition is as follows:
<item tag> = new <item type>
{
   <option definition1>
   ...
   <option definitionn>
}

    Notes:

    i)   The braces are mandatory. 
    ii)  An item definition must begin on a new line.
    iii) Option definitions are optional.
    iv)  You cannot assign values to options in other item definitions.

    The item tag uniquely identifies an item instance. No two item tags
    on a page can be the same. See the section 2.5a 'Identifiers' for
    tag naming conventions.

    Item type is a name that identifies the type of item. Examples of
    item types are: button, label, field, line, and check. See the
    section 'UFDL Form Items' on page 50 for a description of each item
    type.
    There is a finite list of UFDL-defined options applicable to each
    type of item. You can code as many or as few from the list as you
    wish. There are default settings for most options (defined by the
    UFDL). You may choose to use those defaults or to define your own

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 19]


    settings. Defining your own settings overrides the defaults.

    You can also create your own item types. A UFDL parser will ignore
    these custom item types, but you can use them to store information
    specific to your application, and then refer to them in other item
    descriptions in the form. For more information on how to refer to
    options in the form, see 'Referring to Other Options' later in this
    section.

    In the following example, you can see a sample button definition.
    The button has the following characteristics:
    -  The item tag is save_button.
    -  It will save the form to a file on the user's workstation.
    -  The button's label is Save Form.
    -  The background color is cyan.
    -  The font used for the label is Helvetica 12.

save_button = new button
{
   bgcolor = ["cyan"];
   fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "12"];
   type = "save";
   value = "Save Form";
}
------

   2.4e Item Size

    Every external item has a characteristic shape. Many items also
    contain data such as text and images. This is the basic item. For
    example, the basic field is a rectangular space where users can
    input text. Buttons are rectangular objects containing a
    descriptive label.

    Form Item
    Items may also contain the following elements:
    -  borders
    -  an external label
    -  scroll bars

    Borders are lines outlining an item's shape. Their use is optional
    and their thickness is variable. 

    External labels are part of an item's definition but they occupy
    their own space. An example of an external label is the label you
    define for a field. This label occupies space above the field item.

    Several types of items permit users to scroll the data the item
    contains. Typically, scroll bars appear with these items. Examples
    of items permitting scrolling are fields and lists.

    Size Calculation

    There are two sizes calculated for an item. They are:
    -  basic item size
    -  the item's bounding box

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 20]


    The basic item size is composed of the item's characteristic shape
    and any imbedded data. The UFDL defines a set of default basic item
    sizes. You can choose to use these defaults or you can define the
    size using the size option. When deciding whether to define the
    size and what size to specify, you will want to consider any data
    imbedded in the item.

    The bounding box is an unseen rectangular area surrounding each
    item and including all elements of the item. The size of the
    bounding box depends on the sizes of the various elements. The UFDL
    calculates this size, taking into account the basic item size and
    the existence and size of the various optional elements. For
    example, if the item definition contains a borderwidth setting
    (meaning the item has a border), then the bounding box size
    encompasses the basic item and the space occupied by the border.

    See 'Appendix B: See '5.40 Default Sizes'for the default item and
    bounding box sizes.

    Altering Size Dynamically

    You can dynamically alter the bounding box size, and thus the basic
    item size and the space available for the external label. The item
    location option contains various directives permitting you to do
    this.

    A bounding box has six edges: left, right, top, bottom, vertical
    center, and horizontal center. You can align any of these edges
    with the edge of another item's bounding box (called a reference
    item in this context). Once you have aligned one edge, you can
    expand the bounding box until the far edge aligns with another
    location. In this manner, you override the bounding box length in
    that direction.

    For example, you can align the left edge with the horizontal center
    of one reference item. You can then expand the right edge until it
    aligns with the right edge of the original reference item or a
    second reference item. This pair of directives sets the bounding
    box width.

   2.4f Item Placement

    The UFDL supports two different positioning schemes to place
    external items on a page: relational positioning and absolute
    positioning.

    Relational positioning means an item's location depends on the
    location and size of one or more other items on the page. This
    feature is similar to the mechanism used for dynamic sizing.

    Relational positioning uses the bounding boxes of the other items
    as reference points. Items align relative to these bounding boxes.
    You must define the location of the other items before you can use
    them as reference points.

    The itemlocation option provides various directives you can use to
    specify an item's location. For example, you might place an image

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 21]


    before a radio and expand its bottom edge to the bottom edge of the
    radio button.

    The only items whose placement is not affected by relational
    positioning are the first item in the toolbar and the first item in
    the body of the page. The first item assigned to the toolbar goes
    in the top left corner of the toolbar. The first item not assigned
    to the toolbar goes in the top left corner of the body.

    Absolute positioning places an item in an absolute position on the
    page, anchoring it to a particular coordinate. This coordinate is a
    pair of pixel measurements defining the item's distance from the
    top left corner of the page.
    Absolute positioning also allows items to be offset from their
    original position, in order to make layout with an absolute
    positioning scheme more flexible. When offsetting an item, the form
    developer first places the item on the page and then specifies how
    far it should be offset from that position.

    The absolute positioning scheme's advantage is that it makes
    designing a drag-and-drop form designer easy. Absolute positioning
    is not a good cross-platform solution, however, and in order to
    ensure that forms appear consistent on all platforms, developers
    should use either strictly the relational positioning scheme, or a
    careful combination of relational and absolute positioning.

    For more information, see 5.16 itemlocation option description.
------

   2.4g Toolbar Definition

    A toolbar is a section that stretches across the top of a page in
    which items can be placed for quick access. If a user scrolls down
    on a page, the toolbar remains visible.

    A user defines a toolbar using the toolbar item. Each page can have
    one toolbar, and the toolbar will appear on only that page. Place
    items in the toolbar by using the within modifier of the
    itemlocation option.

    The following example shows the definition of a toolbar with two
    items: a label and a close button.

p1_toolbar = new toolbar
{
   bgcolor = ["cyan"];
}
title_label = new label
{
   value = "Student Registration Form";
   fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "16", "bold"];
   itemlocation = [["within", "p1_toolbar"]];
}
close_button = new button
{

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 22]


   type = "close";
   value = "Close Form";
   itemlocation = [["within", "p1_toolbar"], ["below", "title_label"], 
                           ["alignhorizc2c", "title_label"]];
}
------

   2.4h Option Definition

    An option definition is an assignment statement that assigns one
    characteristic to an item, a page, or to the whole form. The
    expression on the right hand side of the equal sign contains the
    option's setting. The syntax of an option definition statement is
    as follows:

    <option identifier> = <expression>;

    Note: The semicolon is mandatory and terminates the statement.

    For example:
    value = "Submit Form";
    fontinfo = ["Helvetica", 16", "bold"];
    url = global.global.db_address

    Explanation of Syntax

    Option identifier is a name that identifies the type of option. It
    can be a UFDL-defined option or a user-defined option. Examples of
    option identifier are: bgcolor, fontinfo, itemlocation, and size.
    See the section 'UFDL Form Options' on page 99 for a description of
    each option and its possible values.

    An expression specifies a value. An expression can be any of the
    following:
    -  a literal
	   (for example, the right hand side of
       value = "Submit Form"; )
    -  a reference to another option definition in the form
	   (for example, the right hand side of 
       url = global.global.db_address; )
    -  an operation
       (for example, the right hand side of 
       value = total_field.value + "3400"; )
    -  an array specification
       (for example, the right hand side of	
       fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "16", "bold"]; )
------

   2.4i Literals
   
    Specify a literal as a quoted string. This is true even for
    operands of an operation. Examples of using literals are:
    "V3.2.0"	- yields "V3.2.0"
    "1" + "2"	- yields "3"
    "UFDL\\" +. "form1"	- yields "UFDL\\form1"
------

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 23]



   2.4j References to Other Options

    In order to copy information from one place in the form to another,
    or to make a decision based on the contents of items in the form, a
    developer needs to refer to one or more other options in the form.

    This is done using an option reference. The referenced option
    definition can exist anywhere in the form definition, including
    after the current statement.
    For examples of option references, see the paragraphs following the
    box below.

    An option reference has several possible formats:
    1.	for options in the current item definition use one of the
    following:*
        -  <option reference>
    	-  <option reference>-><option reference>
    2.	for options in another item definition use one of the
    following:*
        -  <item reference>.<option reference>
        -  <item reference>.<option reference>-><option reference>
    3. for options in page characteristics use one of the following:
        -  global.<option reference> 
    	   - for characteristics on the current page
        -  <page tag>.global.<item reference>
           - for characteristics on another page
    4. for options in form characteristics use:
        global.global.<option reference>

    where <option reference> is one of:
       -  <option identifier>
          - for the complete option setting (it can be a single value
            or an array)
       -  <option identifier>[<array element>]
          - for one element of an array**
    and <item reference> is one of:
       -  <item tag>
          - for items on the current page
       -  <page tag>.<item tag>
          - for items on another page

    and the indirect membership operator (->) indicates:
      -   a dynamic option reference

    - The phrase '-> <option reference>' can occur any number of times
      on the right hand side of an option statement.
    - See 'Array References' on page 30 for information on <array
      element>.

    In order to refer to an option that varies depending on what the
    user of a form enters, use a dynamic option reference. For example,
    a form developer cannot know what cell a user will choose in a
    popup menu. To refer to the value of whatever cell the user
    chooses, the developer must use a dynamic option reference. For

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 24]


    example:

    popup_menu.value->value

    A dynamic option reference (-> <option reference>) provides a
    mechanism for determining the location of the option at run-time.
    The references preceding the indirect membership operator must
    resolve to an item reference or a reference to the form or page
    characteristics.

    Examples of option references are:
    -  an item on the current page:
    list_one.value

    This identifies the value option of the item whose item reference
    is list_one.
    -  a form characteristic:
    global.global.bgcolor

    This identifies the bgcolor option specified at the top of the
    form, as a form global characteristic.
    -  a dynamic option reference with one level of indirection:
    my_choice.value->bgcolor

    The my_choice.value setting becomes the item reference for the
    bgcolor option. If, for example, my_choice.value contains "global",
    then this reference is equivalent to global.bgcolor.
    -  a dynamic option reference with two levels of indirection:
    my_choice.value->value->bgcolor

    The my_choice.value setting becomes the item reference for the
    value option. If, for example, my_choice.value contains
    "your_choice", then my_choice.value->value is equivalent to
    your_choice.value.

    If your_choice.value contains "page_two.global", then the complete
    reference is equivalent to page_two.global.bgcolor.
------

   2.4k Dynamically Created Options

    The UFDL contains a set of special options that allow you to refer
    to a page, item, or option without knowing the page tag and/or item
    tag you would normally include in such a reference. For example, if
    you wanted to refer to a button on the next page in your form,
    normally you would need to know the page tag of the page that
    button was on. Using the UFDL's special reference options, you
    could make the reference without knowing the page tag. You would
    write the reference this way:
    pagenext->submit_button.url

    As another example, you could refer to another item on the next
    page without knowing either the page tag or the name of the item in
    question. This example refers to the last item on the next page:
    pagenext->itemlast.url


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 25]


    Or you could refer to an item without citing any options attached
    to it:
    pagenext->itemlast

    To refer to pages or items in the form without knowing their tags,
    you may use the following reference option names:
    Option n                             Meaning
    itemnext        Next item in the page's description. The last item
                    points to the first item on the current page.
    itemprevious    Previous item in the page's description. The first
                    item points to the last item on the current page.
    pagenext        Next page in the form description. The last page
                    points to the first page.
    pageprevious    Previous page in the form description. The first
                    page points to the last page.
    itemfirst       First item in the current page description.
    itemlast        Last item in the current page description.
    pagefirst       First page in the form description.
    pagelast        Last page in the form description.

    Creating references with reference options

    To create references using the reference option names, follow the
    normal rules for option references (see "References to Other
    Options" earlier in this section). Note that because the reference
    options exist at the option level, but are evaluated to pages or
    items, you need to use the dereference symbol (->) when using them.
    This means that it is necessary to start at the page level, because
    otherwise the parser will interpret the reference as an option.

    Examples
    -  The value of the next item on the current page:
       value = [itemnext->value];
    -  The value of the first item on the next page:
       value = [global.pagenext->itemfirst->value];
    -  The url setting of an item called submit_button on the previous
       page:
       url = "global.pageprevious->submit_button.url";
    -  The first item on the first page of the form:
       itemfirst = "global.global.pagefirst->itemfirst";

    Technical Note - How reference options are added to forms

    Special reference options are dynamically added to the form when it
    is parsed. For example, on every page, the parsing program inserts
    a pagenext option into the page global settings. This pagenext
    option contains the item tag of the next page in the form. It also
    inserts a pageprevious, itemfirst, and itemlast option into the
    page global settings. Each of these options contains the
    appropriate page tag or item tag. Form developers cannot add these
    options to forms; only programs that parse forms can do so. Form
    developers should not try to set or alter these options.

    The parsing program should insert reference options at the form
    global level, page global level, and item level. Reference options

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 26]


    are not saved when the form is saved, and are stripped from the
    form when it is submitted.

    Syntax
    reference_option = <page_tag> | <item_tag>

    The following reference options are available:

    Option name      Setting                    Location in form
    itemnext      Item tag of the next       Each item description
                  item in form's build
                  order
    itemprevious  Item tag of the previous   Each item description
                  item in the form's build
                  order

    pagelast      Page tag of the last page  Form global
                  in the form description

    Note that the reference options refer to items that are next,
    previous, first, or last in the form description. This may not be
    the order in which items or pages appear on screen.

   2.4l Operations

    An operation is a calculation or a decision. The syntax of a
    calculation is one of the following:

    1.	<operand> <math operator> <operand>
    2.	<operand>

    Operands that are numbers can have a unary minus. An operand can be
    any of the following:
    -  a literal (for example, "3")
    -  a reference to another option (for example, total_field.value)
    -  a calculation (for example, "total_field.value" *"4")
    -  (<decision>) - see below for the syntax of a decision

    A math operator can be any of the following:
    -  additive operator
    -  multiplicative operator
    -  exponentiation operator

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 27]



    See the table of operators below.

    The syntax of a decision is as follows:
    <comparison> ? <expression> : <expression>

    where <comparison> is:
    -  <Boolean> <logical operator> <Boolean>

    and <Boolean> is:
    -  <operand> <relational operator> <operand>

    Note: See the table below for the definition of logical and
    relational operators.

    In decisions:
    -  An operand can have a logical NOT (!) before it.
    -  An expression cannot be an array.

    Some examples of decisions are:
    -  A decision based on a check box.
       male_check == "on" ? "male" : "female"

    If the check box is selected, or on, then the result will be male.
    Otherwise, the result will be female. This decision could be used
    to set an item's value.
    -  A decision based on a value.
       name_field == "Smith" ? "on" : "off"

    If the name entered into the name field is Smith, then the result
    will be on.  Otherwise, the result will be off. This decision could
    be used to set an item's active status.

    The UFDL recognizes the following operators:

    Type of Operator      Symbol              Operation
    Additive                +          addition
                          - (minus)    subtraction
                            +.         concatenation
    Multiplicative          *          multiplication
                            /          division
                            %          modulus (returns remainder)
    Exponentiation          ^          exponential
    Relational              >          greater than
                            <          less than 
                            <=         less than or equal to
                            >=         greater than or equal to
                            ==         equal to 
                            !=         not equal to
    Logical                 &&         AND
                            ||         OR
                            !          NOT
    Unary Minus           - (minus)    take negative
    Decision                x?y:z      Assign the value of expression y
                                       to the result if expression x

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 28]


                                       evaluates to true. Otherwise,
                                       assign the value of expression z
                                       to the result.
    Assignment              =          Assign right operand to left
                                       operand
    Membership            . (dot)      structure membership
                            [ ]        array membership
                            ->         indirect membership

    Precedence of Operations

    Operations are evaluated in the following order: 
    -  membership
    -  exponentiation*
    -  multiplicative and unary minus*
    -  additive
    -  relational
    -  logical NOT
    -  logical AND
    -  logical OR
    -  conditional

    Operations at the same level of precedence are evaluated from left
    to right.

    Parentheses override the precedence levels; however, operations
    within parentheses are evaluated using the normal precedence
    levels.
    *When a unary minus immediately follows an exponentiation symbol
    (^), the unary minus is evaluated first. For example, 10^-5 is
    evaluated as ten-to-the-minus-five.

    Concatenation

    An addition operation may imply concatenation. If either operand in
    the addition contains a non-numeric value, the operands are
    concatenated. Otherwise they are added arithmetically. You only
    need to use the concatenation operator if both operands are, or can
    be, numeric values.

    The following examples demonstrate this rule:
    "UFDL\\" + "form1"    -  yields "UFDL\\form1"
    "UFDL\\form" + "1"    -  yields "UFDL\\form1"
    "1" + "2"             -  yields "3"
    "1" +. "2"            -  yields "12"

    The last example would not have resulted in concatenation without
    using the concatenation operator. 

    Separators

    There are two separators in the UFDL: comma (,) and semicolon (;).
    The comma separates list entries; the semicolon terminates an
    option definition statement.


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 29]


   2.4m  Arrays 

    The UFDL uses arrays to store values in options requiring multiple
    settings. The number of elements and the number of dimensions in an
    array depend on the option. However, the syntax of the language
    supports n-elements and n-dimensions. Moreover, the UFDL supports
    arrays containing a mix of simple elements and sub-arrays. 

    The syntax of an array is as follows:
    [<element1>, <element2>, ... <elementn>]
    Note: 'n' is the number of settings in the option.

    An element can be either of the following:
    -  an expression
    -  an element definition statement

    Element Definition Statements

    The element definition statement allows you to assign a variable
    name to an element. Variable names permit you to refer to the
    element by name rather than by its position in the array. The
    syntax of an element definition statement is:
    <variable> = <expression>

    The UFDL syntax includes variable names in some arrays. In this
    case, you must use an element definition statement when assigning
    values to the element. For example, the format option syntax
    specifies names for the check option's range, length and template.
    To assign values to any of these elements, you must use the name
    specified in the syntax.

    Examples of assignment statements using element definition
    statements:
    using a UFDL-defined variable name
       format = ["integer", range=["1","100"]]; 
    using a user-defined variable name
       delay = [the_repeat = "once", the_time = "10"];
    using both UFDL-defined and user-defined variable names
       format = [the_type = "string", length = ["5", "25"]]; 

    Array elements for UFDL-defined option types must be coded in the
    position they are documented in this specification, unless they
    have UFDL-defined variable names listed in this specification. For
    example, the elements for the size option must always be in the
    order [width, height], but the elements for check and format types
    in the format option can be in any order, since they have
    UFDL-defined variable names.

    Decisions in Arrays

    A decision can be used to determine any element within an array, so
    long as that element is not itself an array.

    For example, the following format line is valid. 
    format = [check_1.value == "on" ? "string" : "integer"];


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 30]


    The decision sets the data type to be a string if check_1 is "on",
    or an integer if it is "off".

    This format line is not valid:
    format = ["integer", check_1 == "on" ? range = ["10","20"] :
    range = ["0","10"];

    The range is itself an array, so a decision cannot be used to
    determine which range should apply.

    Array References

    The syntax of an array reference is:
    <array name>[<array element>]
    Note: Repeat the phrase '[<array element>]' until reaching the
    desired depth.

    Array name is an option or variable identifier. Array element can
    be one of two things:
    -  a number indicating the position of the element in the array
    -  variable name

    Before using a variable name, you must define the name in an
    element definition statement. See the section 'Element Definition
    Statements' on page 29 for more information.

    The UFDL array starting position is 0; therefore, a reference to
    the first element of the array is really a reference to element
    zero (0).

    The following examples show various array assignments and
    references:
    itemlocation = [["below", "field1"], ["alignl2l", "field2"],
    ["alignr2c", "field3"]];
       itemlocation[0][1]          - points to "field1"
       itemlocation[2][0]          - points to "alignr2c"
    itemlocation = [the_pos= ["below", "field1"], the_align=
    ["alignl2l", "field2"]];
       itemlocation[the_pos][1]    - points to "field1"
       itemlocation[the_align][0]  - points to "alignl2l"
    format = ["integer", range=["1","10"]];
       format[0]                   - points to "integer"
       format[range]               - points to ["1", "10"]
    format = ["integer", range=[the_low="1", the_high="10"]];
    format[range][the_low]         - points to "1"
------

   2.4n Defining Tabbing and Paging

    The UFDL provides two mechanisms for defining the movement between
    pages and items in a form.
    -  tabbing to the new item or page
    -  linking to the new page 

    You can combine these methods or you can choose to use only one.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 31]



    Tabbing permits the user to move from one item to another and from
    one page to another using a keystroke. Linking permits the user to
    select a form item whose action moves the focus to a new page.

    Note: The only items users may tab or link to are modifiable items.
    These are items users can change or select.

    Tabbing

    To use tabbing, define a tabbing sequence using the next option.
    The sequence can include items anywhere in the form. Define the
    tabbing sequence this way:
    -  Define the first item in the sequence by including the next
       option in the form characteristics. When the form opens, the
       page containing this item displays with the item that is in
       focus.
    -  Define each subsequent item by including the next option in the
       definition of each item in the sequence.

    The next option setting is the item reference of the next item to
    receive focus (that is, the referenced item). When the user tabs
    from the current item, the referenced item receives the focus. If
    the item is on a different page, the current page closes and the
    new page displays.

    You can use tabbing to display a new page without choosing an item
    to activate. Set the next option to the characteristics reference
    for the new page. This displays the new page and focusses on the
    first item in that page's tabbing sequence. The page
    characteristics reference is <page tag>.global.
    -  Define the first item in a page's tabbing sequence by including
    the next option in the page characteristics.

    This example shows a simple tabbing sequence:
version = "3.2.0";
// Open the form on page 'page_one' and focus on 'title_list'.
next = "page_one.title_list";
page_one = new page
{
   // Define the default first item in this page's tabbing sequence.
   next = "name_field";        
   bgcolor = ["LightBlue"];
   form_title = new label
   {
      .......
   }   
   title_list = new list
   {
      // Tab to the 'name_field' item from here.
      next = "name_field";
      ......
   }   
   name_field = new field
   {
      // Tab to the 'your_signature' item on 'page_two' from here.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 32]


      next = "page_two.your_signature";
      ......
   }
}

page_two = new page
{
   bgcolor = ["PaleGreen"];
   form_title = new label
   {
      ......
   }
   your_signature = new tablet
   {
      // Tab back to page 'page_one' and focus on the first item
      // in the page_one tabbing sequence.
      next = "page_one.global";
      ......
   }
}    

    Linking

    To use linking, define action, button, or cell items for the links
    you want to include in the form, and set their type option to
    pagedone. Since each item performs only one link, you require a
    separate action, button, or cell for each link. This method is
    often best suited to defining links to new pages.

    When you link to a new page, do one of the following:
    -  Specify an item on the new page for the focus to move to.
    -  Specify that the focus move to the default position on the new
       page, by "linking" to the page characteristics section.

    Store the reference of the linked item or page in the url option of
    the action, button, or cell. The reference is an item reference or
    a page characteristics reference. Use an item reference when you
    want to link a specific item. Use the page characteristics reference
    when you want to link the first item in the page's tabbing
    sequence. A page characteristics reference is <page tag>.global.

    When the link occurs (i.e., a user selects the button), the current
    page closes and the linked page appears. Before the current page
    can close, all fields containing error checking must be correctly
    filled in.

    This example shows how you might use linking:

version = "3.2.0";
// Open the form on page 'page_one'. Allow the first item in the page's
// tabbing sequence to receive focus.
next = "page_one.global";
page_one = new page
{
   // Define the default first item in this page's tabbing sequence.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 33]


   next = "name_field";        
   bgcolor = ["LightBlue"];
   form_title = new label
   {
      .......
   }   
   name_field = new field
   {
      ......
   }
   next_page = new button
   {
      value = "Page 2";
      // Link to the next page. Allow the first item in the page's
      // tabbing sequence to receive focus.
      type = "pagedone";
      url = "#page_two.global";
      ......
   }
}

page_two = new page
{
   // Define the default first item in this page's tabbing sequence.
   next = "your_signature";        
   bgcolor = ["PaleGreen"];
   form_title = new label
   {
      ......
   }
   your_signature = new tablet
   {
      ......
   }
   first_page = new button
   {
      value = "Page 1";
      // Link to the first page. Allow the first item in the page's
      // tabbing sequence to receive focus.
      type = "pagedone";
      url = "#page_one.global";
      ......
   }
}    

    UFDL-Defined Default Paging and Tabbing Sequence

    The UFDL-defined default sequence depends on the order in which you
    define pages and items in the form. The default first page is the
    first page defined in the form. The default first item is the first
    item defined for the body of that page.

    The sequence progresses through the page definition moving from one
    modifiable item to the next. If a user tabs past the last
    modifiable item on the page, focus returns to the first modifiable

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 34]


    item in the page's toolbar (if one exists) or the first modifiable
    item on the page. The default sequence does not permit you to move
    between pages.

    The UFDL permits you to define pages and items in any order,
    regardless of when and where they display. If you define your pages
    and items in a random order, the default sequence may result in
    apparently random movement.
------

   2.4o Including External Files

    You can code a #include statement anywhere in a form definition
    except imbedded in another statement. You can also nest #include
    statements. See the section 'UFDL Form Viewer Directive' on page
    202 for a syntax of the #include statement.

    In the following examples, you can see the #include statement used
    in a variety of locations.

// Use the standard defaults for v3.2.0 forms. This include file contains
the 
// 'version' option statement and the default 'url' option statement.
#include "v3form.txt"

page_one = new page
{
   // Page one must contain the company logo. This include file
   contains the
   // 'label' and 'data' item definitions.
   #include  "co_logo.txt"
   
   // The remaining items are specific to this form.
   ...
}

// The last page is standard for all company forms. Use the standard
last 
// page definition.
#include "lst_page.txt"
}
------

   2.5  UFDL Language Elements

   2.5a Identifiers

    Identifiers are the names you assign to the following entities:
    -  page tags
    -  item tags
    -  option names
    -  variable names
    -  datagroup names
    -  group names

    The naming conventions for an identifier are as follows:
    -  It must begin with an alphabetic character.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 35]


    -  It can contain any of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, $ and
       underscore.

An example of a valid identifier is sql_query.
------

   2.5b Custom Item Types and Custom Option Names

    These are the names you assign to your own items and options. The
    naming conventions for a custom name are as follows:
    -  It must begin with an alphabetic character.
    -  It can contain any of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, $ and
       underscore.
    -  It must contain an underscore.
------

   2.5c Reserved Words

    The UFDL reserves the following words for its own use:
    -  UFDL item, option and variable names
    -  global
    -  page
    -  new

   2.5d Quoted Strings

    The syntax of a quoted string is:
    "<character string>"

    The minimum length of the string is one (1) byte; the maximum
    length is the lesser of two gigabytes (231 - 1 bytes) and the
    amount of memory the system will allocate.

    Long quoted strings can span multiple lines. To code a multiple
    line string, break the string into segments and surround each
    segment with quotation marks. A reasonable segment length might be
    the maximum line length permitted in your text editor.

    The following example shows a multiple line quoted string in an
    assignment statement. The UFDL treats the segments as contiguous,
    ignoring any white space between them.

    value = "This example demonstrates the use of quoted strings "
            "that span multiple lines.";

    Some characters, such as tabs and line delimiters, are invalid in a
    quoted string unless you use an escape sequence. All escape
    sequences begin with the escape character (\). The following table
    shows the escape sequences the UFDL recognizes and the characters
    they represent.

    Escape
    Sequence         Character                     Comments
    \t            tab                  The UFDL interprets this as an
                                       imbedded tab character.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 36]


    \n            line delimiter       The UFDL interprets this as an
                                       imbedded line delimiter.
    \xnn          hexadecimal number   The UFDL interprets 'nn' as a
                                       hexadecimal number.
    \mnn          octal number         If 'm' is 0, 1, 2 or 3, the UFDL
                                       interprets 'mnn' as an octal
                                       number.
    \"            double quote         The UFDL interprets this as an
                                       imbedded double quote mark.
    \\            backslash            The UFDL interprets this an
                                       imbedded backslash. 
    \<any other>  <any other>          The UFDL ignores the escape
                                       character.
------

   2.5e Binary Data

    Images and sounds are examples of binary data. Store binary data in
    a form using the mimedata option of a data item. The mimedata
    option requires a quoted string as its setting.

    To store binary data in this manner, you must first convert it to
    base64 format, copy the converted data into the form definition,
    and insert the quotation marks. In all likelihood the data will
    span several lines. Enclose each line in quotation marks.

    Converting binary data to base64 format ensures the string contains
    no characters requiring an escape sequence.
------

   2.5f Comments

    Comments must occur at the end of the line or on a line by
    themselves. The UFDL supports two comment formats:
    // comment      - the comment ends at the end of the line
    /* comment */   - these comments can span several lines	
------

   2.5g Security

    Version 4.0 and higher of UFDL supports digital signatures, for
    secure, tamper-proof documents. Digital signatures are incorporated
    into the description of the form, and allow the developer to
    specify that a user may sign the entire form or parts of the form.
    In addition, multiple users may sign a form. Design Goals Behind
    Digital Signatures in UFDL Standards Based Security: Due to the
    sensitive nature of the issues surrounding data security and
    integrity, all digital signature technologies used in UFDL must be
    based on commonly accepted industry standards. UFDL digital
    signature implementation uses the Microsoft Cryptographic API,
    which can be freely obtained from Microsoft. 

    Vendor Independence: Microsoft's basic Cryptographic Service
    Provider (CSP) can be seamlessly replaced with a third party CSP in
    order to meet varying security needs.


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 37]


    Optional Implementation: The act of digitally signing a UFDL form
    should not alter it in any way that prevents it from being opened
    by a viewer that does not support the digital signature technology.

    Partial Content Protection: Forms must be able to be signed both in
    whole and in part to allow for sections to be approved by different
    signing authorities.

    Incremental Protection: Forms or form sections must be able to be
    signed several times to allow for layered or incremental
    authorization.

    How Digital Signatures Work in UFDL

    User-level digital signature functionality is accessible through
    one or more signature buttons, which the form developer must place
    in the form. Typically, a Signature button that is associated with
    a valid digital signature will display the signer's identity. A
    Signature button associated with an invalid signature will display
    the word INVALID. Finally, a Signature button that is not
    associated with a signature will appear to be empty. The form
    developer can override this basic behavior.

    Subject to some constraints specified by the form, a user can
    access the following digital signature functionality: verify the
    digital signatures present in the form, view the signatures in a
    form, digitally sign all or part of a form, and delete the user's
    signature.

    Signature Verification: The signatures in a form will be verified
    automatically when the form is first displayed. The user will be
    warned if any signature verification fails (in addition to the
    invalid appearance displayed by any associated signature buttons).
    Signature Viewing: By pressing a Signature button on the form, the
    user will be able to call upon a Signature Viewer dialog box to
    present the signature associated with the button. The dialog will
    include four buttons: OK, Sign, Delete, and Advanced.

    Example digital signature dialog box

    The default button is OK, so the user can hit the Enter key at any
    time to release the Signature Viewer dialog. If there is no
    signature associated with the Signature button, then the Delete and
    Advanced buttons will be inactive, and text field will be empty.
    The Sign button will be active, and it will receive the focus when
    the Signature Viewer dialog is first displayed so that the user
    can simply hit the space bar to sign the form. If there is a
    signature associated with the Signature button, then the Sign
    button will be inactive, the Delete button may or may not be
    active, and the Advanced button will be active. The Advanced button
    will also receive the focus so that the user can hit space to view
    the advanced information regarding the signature.

    The dialog will also use labels to display the signature status
    (No Signature, Signature Is Valid, Signature Is Invalid), the

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 38]


    signer's identity (e.g., John Doe Manager, jdoe@company.com), the
    identity of the cryptographic service provider used to generate and
    verify the signature (e.g., Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider
    v.1.0), and the hash algorithm used (sha1 or md5). 

    Finally, the dialog will provide a readonly text field labeled
    Certificate Chain that will contain a textual description of the
    chain of certificate issuance for the signer. If there is no
    signature, then all elements will be empty except the signature
    status. If there is a signature, and the user presses the Advanced
    button, then a second dialog box will appear, containing a
    readonly text field and an OK button. The OK button will release
    the advanced dialog if pushed, and the text field will contain a
    UFDL text representation showing what the user signed.

    Digital Signature: If the user presses the Sign button, then the
    viewer will first obtain the digital signature key of the user. If
    the user has more than one digital signature identity, then a
    dialog will be presented allowing the user to select the desired
    identity. The signature will then be created in accordance with the
    specifications of the Signature button, and the signature
    demographics will be placed into the labels and fields of the
    Signature Viewer dialog. The Sign button will be grayed out, and
    the Delete and Advanced buttons will be activated. The Advanced
    button will receive the focus. Thus, the user may then press the
    space bar to view the new signature's advanced information (or
    Enter to release the signature dialog via the default OK button).

    Deleting a Signature: If a valid signature is associated with the
    Signature button, and it belongs to the current user, and the
    deletion of the signature will not corrupt other signatures on the
    form, then the Delete button will be activated. The user is not
    permitted to delete an invalid signature (even if it claims to have
    the user's identity because it may be lying). If the user presses
    this button, then the Signature Demographics field will be emptied,
    the Delete and Advanced buttons will be deactivated, and the Sign
    button will be activated and focused. Thus, the user can hit Enter
    to release the Signature Viewer dialog box via the OK button, or
    space to sign the form. Typically, the user will delete a
    signature, release the dialog, make some changes to the form, then
    reinstantiate the dialog to sign the changed form.
    
    Freezing Option References, Calculations, and Other Formulas

    Once an option has been digitally signed, it maintains the signed
    literal value and will not change, even if the option setting is a
    formula (for example, value=field1.value).

    The literal value is stored in a start value element of the option
    name, which is represented by an open angle bracket with the value
    in quotation marks and a close angle bracket on the left-hand side
    of the equal sign, like this:
    value<"Jane E. Smith"> = page1.nameField.value;

    The viewer sets this literal value when a form is signed,
    submitted, or saved (and discards any old value if necessary).

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 39]


    Because a digitally signed formula never fires after being signed,
    the start value for the option is always the same-and therefore it
    is possible to reference the option and get the signed literal value.

    Non-Compliance

    In accordance with the design criterion of optional implementation,
    viewers that don't support digital signature should, for the most
    part, ignore the digital signature enhancements in a form. Viewers
    that support any UFDL versions prior to v.4.0 not be able to parse
    v.4.0 forms, because of the inclusion of the start value syntax
    starting in v.4.0 (see "Freezing Option References, Calculations,
    and Other Formulas" above). However, if a UFDL viewer v.4.0 or
    higher does not have digital signature capability, then the viewer
    should not attempt to verify the signatures. Further, if a button
    of type signature is pressed, the user should be informed that the
    digital signature feature is not supported.

    If a digital signature fails because the signer's certificate is
    out of date, the viewer will denote this as a failure even if
    everything else checks out. The principal idea behind certificate
    expiry is that keys involved in a signature cannot be trusted
    beyond the expiry date.

    Setting Up a Digital Signature Button

    To allow a form user to digitally sign a form, the form developer
    must create a digital signature button, according to the language
    specs outlined in the UFDL button item description.

    When the user signs the form, the user's digital signature is
    stored in a signature item (consisting of the signer
    identification, the encoded UFDL representation of what is being
    signed, and the filters applied). The developer does not create a
    signature item; rather, it is automatically created by the viewer
    or other form application when the user signs the form.

    Once a form or a portion of a form has been signed, it cannot be
    altered. If it becomes altered, the signature will break, and all
    users will be notified of the broken signature. In addition, some
    applications may refuse to process a form containing a broken
    signature.

    For more information, see the button and signature item
    descriptions.
------

   2.5h Filters

    UFDL supplies options for filtering transmissions and digital
    signatures. The filters allow the form developer to specify the
    items and options that should be included in or omitted from a
    transmission or a signed portion of the form.

    The filters for transmission are: transmitdatagroups,
    transmitgroups, transmititems, transmititemrefs, transmitoptions,

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 40]


    and transmitoptionrefs.

    The filters for digital signatures are: signdatagroups,
    signgroups, signitems, signitemrefs, signoptions, and
    signoptionrefs.

    For details on each filter, see the option descriptions later in
    this document.

    Order of Precedence of Filters

    The order of precedence of filters in a form follow these rules:



    explicit setting of existing filter
   overrides implicit setting of non-existing filter

transmititemrefs = ["omit", "page1.submitButton"];
   overrides the implicit default that all items are transmitted

explicit setting of existing filter
   overrides implicit setting of existing filter

transmitoptions = ["keep", "value"];
   overrides transmititems = ["omit", "field"];

specific explicit setting of existing filter
   overrides general explicit setting of existing filter

transmititemrefs = ["keep", "page1.NameField"];
   overrides transmititems = ["omit", "field"];

the most specific explicit setting of an existing filter
   overrides a less specific explicit setting of an existing filter

transmititemrefs = ["keep", "page1.SellerPopup", "page1.BuyerPopup"];
   overrides transmitgroups = ["omit", "firstName"];

the most general implicit setting
   overrides a less general implicit setting

transmititems = ["keep", "field"]; which implies omitting all non-fields
   overrides the general implicit assumption that all options should be kept
       in the form; the result is that all options in the items that
       are not of type field will be omitted from the transmission.

   2.6  Processing Forms

    Once a user saves or submits a form, it becomes a form instance. In
    the course of a form instance's life cycle, it may be viewed by
    various users at various client sites. Also, several form
    processing applications may handle the form. To ensure consistency
    and integrity of the form's appearance and contents, there are
    some important form processing rules in the UFDL.
------

   2.6a Include Statements

    The rules governing handling of #include statements state:
    -  All #include statements are resolved when the form appears. The
       only exception occurs when the referenced file cannot be found.
       In this instance, the #include statement remains in the form.
    -  When a #include statement is resolved, the #include statement
       definition is permanently deleted from the form instance.

    These rules combine to ensure that the definition of a particular
    form instance remains constant from first to last viewing, and that
    no user data disappears.
------

   2.6b Expressions

    The rule governing handling of expressions in value options states:
    -  Expressions are overwritten if the item is modifiable and the
       user updates the value displayed, or if the form submission
       format is HTML.

    This rule ensures that forms submitted in UFDL format continue to
    work as originally designed even after processing.
------

3.0 UFDL Global and Page Settings

    At the top of each form and each page, a form developer can specify
    options that apply to the whole form or the particular page. These
    are called global settings and page settings.

    The syntax of global settings is as follows:
    version = <version_number>;
    <option definition2>
    ...
    <option definitionn>

    Notes:
    i)   The version option is mandatory. It must be the first line in
         the form.
    ii)  All options other than version are optional.
    iii) Global settings must appear before the first page declaration.
    iv)  A page setting can override a form global option for the
         particular page.

    The syntax of page settings is as follows:

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 42]


    <page tag> = new page
    {
    <option definition1>
    ...
    <option definitionn>

   Notes:
   i)   Page settings are optional.
   ii)  Page settings must appear before the first item definition in
        the page.
   iii) A page will assume the characteristics specified in the global
        settings unless they are overridden by settings of the same
        type in the page settings.
   iv)	Options within item declarations override page settings for the
        particular item they appear in.

    The following pages outline which options can be used as global
    settings and which options can be used as page settings.
------

   3.1  Global Settings

    Global settings specify particular settings for the form and
    determine its physical characteristics. For example, the version
    option defines which version of the UFDL the form was written in.
    The bgcolor option determines the background color of all pages in
    the form. Global settings appear at the top of a form and apply to
    the whole form. Options defined within a page or item can override
    global settings for that particular page or item.

Available Options
    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  bgcolor
    -  Background color of form. Default: 255, 255, 255 (white)
    -  bordercolor
    -  Border color of items in form. Default: 0, 0, 0 (black)
    -  borderwidth
       -  Border width of items in form. Default: Depends on item
    -  fontcolor
       -  Color of all value text in form. Does not apply to the text
          of label options. Default: black
    -  fontinfo
    -  Style of all value text in form. Does not apply to the text of
       label options. Default: Helvetica, 8, plain label
       -  Text that appears in title bar of form. Default: n/a
    -  next
       -  Item the focus appears on when form opens. Default: First
          input
       -  item in form description
    -  saveformat
       -  Format in which the form is saved. Default: uncompressed UFDL
    -  transmitformat
       -  Format in which the form is transmitted. Default:
          uncompressed UFDL

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 43]


    -  triggeritem
       -  Item tag of item that triggered a submit or done action.
       Default: n/a
    -  version
       -  Version of UFDL used to make the form. Default: n/a

Usage Notes

    1) Define global settings at the top of the form, before the first
    page declaration.

    2) The version option is mandatory and must be the first line in
    the form.

    3) You can give the form a title that appears in the title bar by
    setting a global label option.

    4) To specify a title to appear in the form's title bar, use the
    label option as a global setting.

Example

    This example defines settings and characteristics for the form.

version = "3.2.0";
saveformat = "application/uwi_form; content-encoding=\"gzip\" ";
label = "Time Sheet";
bgcolor = ["ivory"];
fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "10", "plain"];

    These global settings specify that:
    -  The form is written in version 3.2.0 of the UFDL.
    -  All saves activated from the form should save the form as a
       compressed UFDL form, unless specified otherwise in an item that
       initiates a save.
    -  The title Time Sheet should appear in the title bar of all
       pages, unless specified otherwise in a page global.
    -  All pages, toolbars, boxes, labels, and tablets should have an
       ivory background, unless they contain an option specifying
       otherwise.
    -  All pages and items should use a plain, Helvetica, 10-point
       font, unless they contain an option specifying otherwise. (Note:
       Labels that are parts of other items, like fields, are excluded
       from the fontinfo option. They are set using the labelfontinfo
       option.)
------

   3.2  Page Settings

    Page settings specify settings (like next and saveformat) and
    characteristics (like bgcolor) for the page they appear on. Page
    settings appear at the top of each page definition, and apply to
    the whole page. They can be overridden by option settings within
    items.

    Available Options

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 44]


    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  bgcolor
    -  Background color of page. Default: 255, 255, 255 (white)
    -  bordercolor
       -  Border color of items in page. Default: 0, 0, 0 (black)
    -  borderwidth
       -  Border width of items in page. Default: Depends on item
    -  fontcolor
       -  Color of all value text in page. Does not apply to the text
          of label options. Default: black
    -  fontinfo
       -  Style of all value text in page. Does not apply to the text
          of label options. Default: Helvetica, 8, plain
    -  label
       -  Text that appears in title bar of page. Default: n/a
    -  next
       -  Item the focus appears on when page opens. Default: First
          input item in form description
    -  saveformat
       -  Format in which the page is saved. Default: uncompressed UFDL
    -  transmitformat
       Format in which the page is transmitted. Default: uncompressed
       UFDL

    Usage Notes

    1) Define page settings at the top of a page, after the opening
    brace and before the first item declaration.

    2) Page settings apply only to the page they are on.

    3) Page settings are optional.

    4) To specify a title to appear in the page's title bar, use the
    label option as a page setting.

    Example

    The following example shows page global options on two pages within
    a single form.

...
page_1 = new page
{
	bgcolor = ["seashell"];
	next = "Name_field";

	<item declaration>
...
}
page_2 = new page
{
	fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "14", "plain"];
	next = "Activity_popup";

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 45]



	<item declaration>
...
    Page one would have a seashell-colored background, and would direct
    the focus to the item called Name_field as soon as it opened. It
    would assume the rest of its settings from the form's global
    settings. (If no form global settings exist, the page will assume
    the UFDL defaults.)

    On page two, the font would appear as plain, Helvetica, 14-point
    type and the focus would be directed to the item called
    Activity_popup as soon as the page opened. Page two would assume
    the rest of its settings from the page global options and UFDL
    defaults. 
------

4.0 UFDL Form Items

    Items are the basic elements of a page. The syntax of an item
    definition is as follows:

    <item tag> = new <item type>
    {
      <option definition1>
      ...
      <option definitionn>
    }

    Notes:
    i)   The braces are mandatory. 
    ii)  An item definition must begin on a new line.
    iii) Option definitions are optional.
    iv)  You cannot assign values to options in other item definitions.

    The item tag uniquely identifies an item instance. No two item tags
    on a page can be the same. Item type is a name that identifies the
    type of item. This section contains information about the
    UFDL-defined item types and the options available for each.

    Note: Defining an option more than once in an item's definition may
    cause unpredictable behavior.

    See the section 'Item Definition' on page 15 for more information
    on the syntax and rules regarding an item definition.
------

   4.1 action

    The action item allows you to specify form-initiated actions that
    execute automatically. The actions can be any of the following
    types: 
    -  link
    -  replace
    -  submit
    -  done

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 46]


    -  display
    -  print
    -  cancel

    See the type option section for a description of each of these
    actions. 

    You can define action items that occur only once or repeat at
    specified time intervals. You can also define actions that occur
    after the page opens but before the page appears. See the section
    on the delay option for information on timing options.

    Action items can trigger either background actions or actions
    involving user interaction. In fact, if the form contains only
    hidden items such as action items, then the whole form operates in
    the background. Such forms are called daemon forms.

    Available Options

    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  active
       -  Specifies whether item is active or inactive. Default: on
    -  datagroup
       -  Identifies group or folder of enclosed files. Default: none
    -  delay
       -  Delays execution of automatic action or specifies automatic
          action repeat factor. Default: repeat factor of once,
          interval of zero seconds
    -  transmitdatagroups
       -  Lists which datagroups of items should be kept or omitted
          from a transmission. Default: see Precedence of Filters
    -  transmitformat
       -  Specifies format of form data transmitted to form processing
          application. Default: uncompressed UFDL
    -  transmitgroups
       -  Lists which groups of items should be kept or omitted from a
          transmission. Default: see Precedence of Filters
    -  transmititemrefs
       -  Lists which specific items should be kept or omitted from a
          transmission. Default: see Precedence of Filters
          transmititems

          form data submitted to form processing application. Default:
          see Precedence of Filters
    -  transmitoptions
       -  Lists which types of options to include in or omit from form
          data submitted to form processing application. Default: see
          Precedence of Filters
    -  type
       -  Associates task type with item that can trigger a task:
          action, button, or cell. Default:link

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 47]


    -  url
       -  Identifies an object to access, for items with type option
          setting of link, replace, submit, done, or pagedone. Default:
          none

    1) Repeating automatic actions is one method of creating a
    sparse-stated connection. It allows the form to indicate
    periodically to a server application that it is still running. Use
    the delay option to specify repetition.

    2) Actions, by the form definition rules, reside on a page;
    therefore, actions occur only when the page is open, and repeating
    actions stop when a the page closes. Actions defined to occur
    before the page displays, occur each time the page opens.

Examples

    Example 1

    The following action will send a status message to the server. The
    transaction happens automatically every 10 minutes (600 seconds).

sendStatus_action = new action
{
   delay = ["repeat", "600"];
   type = "submit";
   url = ["http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/recv_status"];
}

    Example 2

    This action will link to a search form as soon as the current page
    displays.

grabSearch_action = new action
{
   delay = ["once", "0"];
   type = "link";
   url = ["http://www.server.com/application/ index/search.frm"];
}

    Example 3

    Background actions can also cancel forms, or prompt the user to
    save a form. Here is an example:
// Automatically prompt the user to save the form after 5 minutes
autoSave_action = new action
{
   delay = ["once", "300"];
   type = "save";
}
//
// Automatically close the form after 10 minutes

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 48]


autoCancel_action = new action
{
   delay = ["once", "600"];
   type = "cancel";
}

   4.2  box

    The box item creates a square box on the form. You may not place
    other items in the box; however, you may place other items on top
    of it. The purpose of box items is simply to add visual variety to
    the form. 

    Available Options
    -  Option
    -  Behavior

    Specifies box's size in characters. Default: width 1 character,
    height 1 character

    Usage Notes

    1) To make the box more visible, assign a background color that
    differs from the page background color (the default).

    2) When setting the size option of a box, the height and width of
    the box will be based on the average character size for the font in
    use (set with the fontinfo option).

    Example

    The following example shows a typical box description. The box is
    25 characters wide and 4 characters high. Notice the background
    color setting.

blue_box = new box
{
   bgcolor = ["blue"];
   size = ["25", "4"];
}

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 51]



    Usage Notes
    
    1)  The button's label is defined by the value option. If no value
    option exists, the default label is blank.

    2) When setting the size option of a button, the height and width
    of the button will be based on the average character size for the
    font in use (set with the fontinfo option).

    Behavior of Buttons in Digital Signatures

    1)  A digital signature button is the means by which the user can
    digitally sign a form. To make a button a Signature button, set its
    type to signature.

    2)  Digital Signature buttons allow users to do the following:
        -  Sign the form or portion of the form the button specifies
        -  Delete their signatures (a signature can be deleted only by
           the user whose signature it is, and if the signature is
           currently valid and not signed by some other signature)
        -  View the signature and view the UFDL text of what the
          signature applies to

    3)  All option references, calculations, and other formulas in any
    signed portion of a form are frozen once they have been signed.
    Their setting will be valued at the setting they contained at the
    moment when the signature was created. If the user deletes the
    digital signature, however, then the formulas will become unfrozen,
    and will change dynamically as normal.
    4)  The usual options for other buttons (i.e. size, image, value)
    can also be used with Signature buttons.

Examples

    Example 1

    This button links the form to a server (www.server.com) and
    retrieves a form called fromHelp.frm.

getHelp_button = new button
{
   value = "Get Help";
   type = "link";
   url = ["http://www.server.com/application/help/formHelp.frm"];
}

    Example 2

    Buttons that trigger form processing requests must have a type
    option setting of submit or done. The definition for such a button
    might look like this:

submit_button = new button
{
   value = "Process Form";

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 52]


   fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "18", "bold", "italic"];
   type = "submit";
   url = ["http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/formProcessor"];
}

    Example 3

    This button encloses an external file in the form. The action to
    enclose a file is enclose. The datagroup option identifies the list
    of datagroups, or folders, in which the user can store the enclosed
    file. An enclose button might take the following form:

enclose_button = new button
{
   value = "Enclose File";
   fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "18", "bold", "italic"];
   type = "enclose";
   datagroup = ["Images_Asia", "Images_Eur" , "Images_SAmer"];
}

    This button will allow users to enclose files into one of three
    datagroups (folders): Images_Asia, Images_Eur, Images_SAmer.

    Example 4

    This example shows a Signature button with the basic elements. Its
    type is designated as "signature"; it omits trigger item and
    coordinates options throughout to avoid breaking the signature; and
    the name of the signature is set as "mysig."

SIG1 = new button
{
	type = "signature";
     sigoptions = ["omit", "triggeritem", "coordinates"];
	signature = "mysig";
}

------

   4.4  cell

    The cell item populates combobox, list and popup items. A cell can
    belong to multiple comboboxes, lists and popups. See the combobox,
    list and popup item sections for information on associating cells
    with these items.

    Cells fall into two categories according to their behavior:

    -  Action cells
       These cells perform the same set of actions normally associated
       with buttons. This includes such things as cancelling, saving
       and submitting the form.

    -  Select cells
       These cells provide users with a mutually exclusive set of

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 53]


       values from which to choose. When chosen, these cells appear
       selected. In a list this means the cell is highlighted in some
       way. In a popup, the cell's label becomes the popup's label.

    Available Options
    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  active
    -  Specifies whether cell is active or inactive. Default: on
    -  datagroup
       -  Identifies group or folder of enclosed files. Default: none
    -  group
       -  Groups cells together. Default: none
    -  label
       -  Specifies external text label for cell. Default: none
    -  transmitdatagroups
       -  Lists which datagroups of items should be kept or omitted
          from a transmission. Default: see Precedence of Filters
    -  transmitformat
       -  Specifies format of form data submitted to processing
          application. Default: uncompressed UFDL
    -  transmitgroups
       -  Lists which groups of items should be kept or omitted from a
          transmission. Default: see Precedence of Filters
    -  transmititemrefs
       -  Lists which specific items should be kept or omitted from a
          transmission. Default: see Precedence of Filters
    -  transmititems
       -  Lists types of items to include in or omit from form data
          submitted to form processing application. Default: see
          Precedence of Filters
    -  transmitoptionrefs
       -  Lists which specific options should be kept or omitted from
          form data submitted to form processing application. Default:
          see Precedence of Filters
    -  transmitoptions
       -  Lists which options to include in or omit from form data
          submitted to form processing application. Default: see
          Precedence of Filters
    -  type
       -  Associates task type with item that can trigger a task:
          action, button, or cell. Default:link
    -  url
       -  Identifies an object to access, for items with type option
          setting of link, replace, submit, done, or pagedone. Default:
          none
    -  value
       -  Contains identity of most recently selected cell

    Usage Notes

    1)  Use the type option to establish a cell's behavior. Select
    cells that have a type of select (the default type).

    2)  Cells can have both value and label options. These options
    affect the form differently depending on whether the cell is linked

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 54]


    to a combobox, a popup, or a list. In general, the label of the
    cell will be displayed as a choice, while the value of the cell
    will be displayed if that cell is selected.  For more information,
    refer to the appropriate item type.

    3)  Cells take their color and font information from the combobox,
    list and popup items with which they are associated. In this way,
    a cell's appearance can vary according to the list the user is
    viewing.
------

   4.5  check

    The check item provides a simple check box to record a selected or
    not selected answer from a user. A selected check box appears
    filled while a deselected box appears empty. 

    The exact appearance of the check box is platform[PD1] dependent;
    but the shape is rectangular. The check box appears as a normal
    check box for the users of each platform.

       -  Indicates user answer's as to whether check box is checked
          (on) or not (off). Default: off

    Usage Notes

    1)  The value option setting indicates the user's answer. If the
    user selects or checks the check box, the value option contains on,
    otherwise it contains off. The default value is off.

    2)  Check boxes do not belong to groups like radio buttons-each
    check box may be turned on or off independently of the others.

    3)  The label option defines the label for the check box. The label
    appears above the check box and aligned with the boxes left edge.
    There is no default label.

    4)  When setting the size option of a check box, the height and
    width of the bounding box will be based on the average character
    size for the font in use (set with the fontinfo option).

    5)  The fontcolor option determines the color of the check box fill
    pattern (default is red).

    Example

    This value option setting in this check box is on, so the check box
    will appear selected when it displays. The item's label is Activate
    Health Plan, and the label will display in a Times 14 Bold font
    colored blue.

healthPlan_check = new check
{
   value = "on";
   label = "Activate Health Plan";
   labelfontinfo = ["Times", "14", "bold"];
   labelfontcolor = ["blue"];
}

   4.6  combobox

    Comboboxes act like a hybrid of a field and a popup. Unopened, a
    combobox with a label occupies the same space two labels, and a
    combobox without a label occupies the same space as a single label.
    After a user chooses a cell, the combobox closes (that is, returns
    to its unopened state). 

    If none of the cells are appropriate, the user can type other
    information into the combobox. When information is typed in, it is
    stored in the value option of the combobox. When a cell is
    selected, the value option stores the value of that cell.

    A combobox's label appears above the combobox item.

    Usage Notes
    
    1)  Place cells in a combobox by creating a group for the combobox
    and assigning cells to the group. Create a group using the group
    option in the combobox definition. Assign cells to the group using
    the group option in the cell definition.

    2)  Cells that have a label option will display that label in the
    list. Otherwise, the value of the cell will be displayed. When a
    cell is selected, the value of that cell will be displayed in the
    combobox and stored internally.

    3)  Combobox, popup, and list items with the same group reference
    display the same group of cells.

    4)  When first viewed, a combobox will display its value. If no
    value is set, the combobox will be empty.

    5)  The value option will contain one of the following:
        -  The value of the most recently chosen selection.
        -  Nothing if an action was most recently chosen.
        -  The text entered if something was typed in most recently.

    6)  When setting the size option of a combobox, the height and
    width of the popup will be based on the average character size for
    the font in use (set with the fontinfo option).

    7)  The label option sets the text displayed above the item, as
    with a field.

    8)  When setting the editstate option, the combobox will behave in
    the following manner:
        -  A readwrite setting will cause it to function normally.
        -  A readonly setting will cause the combobox to refuse all
           input, although it will function normally otherwise and

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 58]


           formulas will still be able to change the value.
        -  A writeonly setting will cause the combobox to use
           "password" characters in its field contents, but the list of
           choices will still be displayed in plain text.

    9)  When a format is applied to a combobox, the formatting will be
    applied to the value of each cell linked to the combobox.  Those
    cells that fail the check will be flagged or filtered.  Those cells
    that pass the check will have their value replaced with a formatted
    value. See the format option for more information.

    10) If any two comboboxes, lists, or popups use the same set of
    cells, they must apply the same formatting.

    Example

    This is an example of a combobox containing a set of selections
    allowing users to choose a color.

CATEGORY_POPUP = new combobox
{
   group = "combo_Group";
   label = "Choose a Color:";
}

    Notice the default label is "Choose a Color:". This will display
    above the combobox.  Until the user types in something or makes a
    selection, the field area of the combobox will be blank.

    These are the cells that make up the combobox. Notice they are
    select cells and they belong to the same group as the combobox:
    combo_Group.

RED_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "combo_Group";
   type = "select";
   value = "Red";
}
WHITE_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "combo_Group";
   type = "select";
   value = "White";
}
BLUE_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "combo_Group";
   type = "select";
   value = "Blue";
}

   4.7  data


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 59]


    The data item stores an information object such as an image, a
    sound, or an enclosed file in a UFDL form. Data in data items must
    be encoded in base64 format.

    Data items are created automatically when you enclose files in a
    form. Enclose files using items with a type option setting of
    enclose.

    Available Options

    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  datagroup
       -  Identifies group or folder of enclosed files. Default: none
    -  filename
       -  Identifies name of enclosed file. Default: none
    -  mimedata
       -  Contains actual data associated with a data item. Default:
          none

    2)  Store the data in the mimedata option, and the data's MIME type
    in the mimetype option.

    Example

    This is an example of a data item produced as the result of
    enclosing a file (the data component used here is artificial, and
    is only for demonstration purposes). Notice the quotation marks
    surrounding each segment of the data.

Supporting_Documents_1 = new data

   4.8  field

    The field item creates a text area where users can display and
    enter one or more lines of data. The field's characteristics
    determine the number of lines, the width of each line, and whether

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 60]


    the field is scrollable.

    Field data can be protected from modification, made to display in

       -  Reflects contents of field-numeric, alphabetic, or otherwise.
          Default: none
 
    Usage Notes
    
    1)  When setting the size option of a field, the height and width
    of the field will be based on the average character size for the
    font in use (set with the fontinfo option).

    2)  The editstate option determines whether the field is read only,
    write only (for passwords, for example) or available for both
    reading and writing. 

    3)  The format option specifies the data type of the field's data.
    It also contains flags allowing you to specify edit checks and
    formatting you want applied to the data.

    4)  The label option defines the field's label. The label is placed
    above the field and aligned with the field's left edge. 

    5)  The scrollvert and scrollhoriz options govern a field's
    scrolling characteristics. They must be set to always to permit
    scrolling. With scrolling enabled, scroll bars display along the
    bottom (horizontal scrolling) and right (vertical scrolling) edges
    of the field.

Examples

    Example 1

    This is an example of a single line field item that allows 20
    characters of input. An initial value of 23000 has been defined for
    the field. When the form appears, the field will contain this value.

income_field = new field
{
   label = "Annual income";
   value = "23000";
   size = ["20", "1"];
   fontinfo = ["Courier", "12", "plain"];
   labelfontinfo = ["Helvetica", "12", "plain"];
   labelfontcolor = ["blue"];
}

    Example 2

    To create a multiple line field, the vertical size of the field

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 62]


    must be adjusted (either with size or with itemlocation modifiers).
    As well, vertical scroll bars can be added, and word wrapping
    turned on. Here is an example:

job_field = new field
{
   label = "Job Description";
   size = ["50", "5"];
   scrollvert = "always";
   scrollhoriz = "wordwrap";
   fontinfo = ["Times", "12", "plain]";
   labelfontinfo = ["Helvetica", "12", "plain"];
   labelfontcolor = ["blue"];
}
------

   4.9  help
   
    A help item defines a help message you can use to support various
    external items in the form. You can create a separate help item
    for every item you want to support, or you can use one help item
    for several items.

    Available Options

    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  active
       -  Specifies whether field is active or inactive. Default: on
    -  value
       -  Reflects help item's contents

    Usage Notes

    1)  The help item's value option contains the help message text.

    2)  The link between the help item and the supported item is
    created by the help option in the supported item's definition. The
    help option contains the help item's item reference.

    Example

    This is an example of a button for which help information is
    available.

    First, here is the button definition. Notice the help item's item
    reference in the help option.

fullPicture_button = new button
{
   value = "View Full-Sized Picture";
   help = "button_help";
   fontinfo = ["Times", "14", "plain"];
   type = "link";
   url = ["http://www.server.com/application/fullPic.frm"];
}

    Now, here is the help item referred to in the button definition.
    The contents of the value option are used as the help message when
    the user asks for help with the button.

button_help = new help
{
   value = "Pressing this button will bring a full-sized image in a
            form " 
                "down to your viewer.";
}
------

   4.10 label

    The label item defines a static text message or an image to display
    on the form. If both an image and a text message are defined for
    the label, the image takes precedence in viewers able to display
    images.

     Available Options

     -  Option
     -  Behavior
     -  active
        -  Specifies whether label is active or inactive. Default: on

       -  Points to help message for label.
    -  image
       -  Defines image for label. Default: none
    -  itemlocation
       -  Specifies location of label in page layout. Default: in body
          of page, under previous item in page definition, aligned
          along page's left margin
    -  justify
       -  Aligns lines of text within space label occupies
    -  size
       -  Specifies label's size in characters. Default: width 1
          character if label empty, otherwise label width; height 1
          character if label empty, otherwise label height
    -  value

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 64]


       -  Defines text for label. Default: none

    Usage Notes
    
    1)  To define the text for a label, use the value option. To define
    an image for a label, use the image option.

    2)  To create a multiple line text message, add line breaks to the
    message text. Use the escape sequence '\n' to indicate a line
    break.

    3)  When setting the size option of a label, the height and width
    of the label will be based on the average character size for the
    font in use (set with the fontinfo option).  

Examples

    Example 1

    This is an example of a text label. The text is centered in the
    space the label occupies. The label width is 30 characters (thus
    it is bigger than the text in the label).

MAINMENU_LABEL = new label
{
   value = "Welcome to the Main Menu";
   fontinfo = ["Helvetica", "24", "bold", "italic"];
   size = ["30", "1"];
   justify = "center";
}

    Example 2

    This is an example of a multiple line text label. Notice the line
    break escape sequences indicating the end of each line.

// Specify right justification for this label.
RHYME_LABEL = new label
{
   value = "Little miss Muffet\n Sat on her tuffet,\n"
                "Eating her curds and whey.\n When along came a
                spider,\n"
                "who sat down beside her,\n and frightened miss Muffet
                away!";
   fontinfo = ["Times", "16", "italic"];
}
------

   4.11 line

    The line item draws a simple vertical or horizontal line on the
    form. This is useful when you want to visually separate parts of a
    page.

    Available Options

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 65]



    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  fontcolor
       -  Defines font color for text or filler portion of label.
          Default: black
    -  fontinfo
       -  Defines font name, point size, and font characteristics for
          text portion of label. Defaults: Helvetica, 8, plain
    -  itemlocation
       -  Specifies location of line in page layout. Default: in body
          of page, under previous item in page definition, aligned
          along page's left margin
    -  size
       -  Determines whether line is horizontal or vertical: if
          horizonal dimension=0 then line is vertical, if vetical
          dimension=0 then line is horizontal; calculated in characters
    -  thickness
       -  Determines how thick line will be, in pixels

    Usage Notes

    1)  Specify the dimensions of a line using the size and thickness
    options. The size option determines whether the line is vertical or
    horizontal. If the horizontal dimension is set to zero, then the
    line is vertical. If the vertical dimension is set to zero, then
    the line is horizontal. Size is calculated in characters.
        -  The thickness option determines how thick the line will be.
           Thickness is calculated in pixels.

    2)  The fontinfo option information is used when calculating the
    line's size. The size option's unit of measurement is characters;
    therefore, choice of font can affect the size. See the size option
    for more information.

    3)  The fontcolor option defines the color of the line.

    Example

    This is an example of a horizontal line with a thickness of five
    pixels.

BLUE_LINE = new line
{
   size = ["40", "0"];
   thickness = "5";
}
------

   4.12 list

    The list item creates a list from which users can make selections
    (as in a list of names) and trigger actions (such as enclosing
    files and submitting the form). A list can contain both selections
    and actions.


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 66]


    The entries in the list are cell items. Selections are cells with a
    type option setting of select. Actions are cells with any other
    type option setting.

    Available Options

       -  Specifies list's size in characters. Default: width=larger of
          label width and widest cell, height=number of cells in list
    -  value
       -  Contains item reference of most recently selected cell in
          list (if it was a select cell); contains nothing if most
          recently selected cell was not a select cell

    Usage Notes

    1)  Place cells in a list by creating a group for the list and
    assigning cells to the group. Create a group using the group option
    in the list definition. Assign cells to the group using the group
    option in the cell definition.

    2)  Cells that have a label option will display that label in the
    list. Otherwise, the value option of the cell will be displayed.

    3)  List, combobox and popup items with the same group reference
    display the same group of cells.

    4)  The value option will contain one of the following:
        -  The item reference of the most recently chosen cell if the
           cell was of type "select".
        -  Nothing if the cell most recently chosen was of any type
           other than "select".
    5)  Define the list's label using the label option.

    6)  When setting the size option of a list, the height and width of
    the list will be based on the average character size for the font
    in use (set with the fontinfo option).

    7)  A vertical scroll bar will appear beside the list if the number
    of cells is greater than the height (defined with the size option)
    of the list.

    8)  When a format is applied to a list, the formatting will be
    applied to the value of each cell linked to the list.  Those cells
    that fail the check will be flagged or filtered.  Those cells that
    pass the check will have their value replaced with a formatted
    value. See the format option for more information.

    9)  If any two comboboxes, lists, or popups use the same set of
    cells, they must apply the same formatting.

    Example

    This is an example of a list containing three actions: submit form,
    save form, and cancel form.

    Here is the list definition.
    
MAINMENU_LIST = new list
{
   group = "list_Group";
   label = "Options Menu";

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 68]


   labelfontcolor = ["blue"];
   size = ["3", "20"];
}

    These are the cells that make up the list. Notice they are action
    cells and they belong to the same group as the list: list_Group.
SUBMIT_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "list_Group";
   type = "submit";
   url = ["http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/processForm"];
   value = "Submit Form";
}
SAVE_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "list_Group";
   type = "save";
   value = "Save Form";
}
CANCEL_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "list_Group";
   type = "cancel";
   value = "Cancel this Form";
}
------

   4.13 popup

    The popup item creates a popup menu from which users can make
    selections (as in a list of names) and trigger actions (such as
    enclosing files and submitting the form). A popup can contain both
    selections and actions.

    The entries in the popup are cell items. Selections are cells with
    a type option setting of select. Actions are cells with any other
    type option setting.

    Popups act like a hybrid of a label, a button, and a list.
    Unopened, a popup occupies only the space required for its label.
    Open, the popup displays a list of selections and actions. After a
    user chooses a selection or an action, the popup closes (that is,
    returns to its unopened state). A popup's label displays inside the
    popup item.

          of page, under previous item in page definition, aligned
          along page's left margin
    -  justify
       -  Aligns lines of text within the space popup occupies.
    -  label
       -  Specifies external text label for popup. Default: none
    -  next
       -  Identifies item to receive focus when user tabs ahead from
          current item. Default: depends on order in which page and
          item definitions occur within form definition
    -  size
       -  Specifies popup's size in characters. Default: width=larger
          of label width and widest cell, height=1 character
    -  value
       -  Contains item reference of most recently selected cell in
          popup (if it was a select cell); contains nothing if most
          recently selected cell was not a select cell

    Usage Notes

    1)  Place cells in a popup by creating a group for the popup and
    assigning cells to the group. Create a group using the group option
    in the popup definition. Assign cells to the group using the group
    option in the cell definition.

    2)  Cells that have a label option will display that label in the
    list. Otherwise, the value of the cell will be displayed. When a
    cell is selected, the value of that cell will be displayed in the
    popup.

    For example, if cell had a value of "USA", and a label of "United
    States of America", the full version would be shown in the popup
    list.  Once the cell was selected, the popup would display the
    abbreviation.

    3)  Popup, combobox and list items with the same group reference
    display the same group of cells.


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 70]


    4)  The value option will contain one of the following:
        -  The item reference of the most recently chosen cell if the
           cell was of type "select".
        -  Nothing if the cell most recently chosen was of any type
           other than "select".

    5)  When setting the size option of a popup, the height and width
    of the popup will be based on the average character size for the
    font in use (set with the fontinfo option).

    6)  The label option contains the popup's default label. When the
    value option is empty, the default label displays. Otherwise, the
    label of the cell identified in the value option appears.

    7)  When a format is applied to a popup, the formatting will be
    applied to the value of each cell linked to the popup.  Those cells
    that fail the check will be flagged or filtered.  Those cells that
    pass the check will have their value replaced with a formatted
    value. See the format option for more information.

    8)  If any two comboboxes, lists, or popups use the same set of
    cells, they must apply the same formatting.

    Example

    This is an example of a popup containing a set of selections
    allowing users to choose a category.

    Here is the popup definition. Notice the default label is "Choose a
    Category:". This will display until a user makes a selection.
    Afterwards, the cell's value will display as the label.

CATEGORY_POPUP = new popup
{
   group = "popup_Group";
   label = "Choose a Category:";
}

    These are the cells that make up the popup. Notice they are select
    cells and they belong to the same group as the popup: popup_Group.

HISTORY_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "popup_Group";
   type = "select";
   value = "World History";
}
SCIENCE_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "popup_Group";
   type = "select";
   value = "Physical Sciences";
}
MUSIC_CELL = new cell
{
   group = "popup_Group";

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 71]


   type = "select";
   value = "Music";
}

   4.14  radio

    The radio button item is intended for use with one or more other
    radio button items. A group of radio buttons presents users with a
    set of mutually exclusive choices. Each radio button represents one
    choice the user can make.

    There is always one selected radio button in the group. As well,
    since radio buttons present a mutually exclusive set of choices,
    only one radio button in a group can be selected. When a user
    chooses a radio button, that radio button becomes selected.

    A selected radio button appears filled in some way. All other radio
    buttons in the group appear empty.

    Available Options

    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  active
       -  Specifies whether radio button is active or inactive.
          Default: on
    -  bgcolor
       -  Defines background color of radio button. Default: white
    -  bordercolor
       -  Defines color of border around radio button. Default: black
    -  borderwidth
       -  Defines width of radio button's border, in pixels. Default: 1
          pixel
    -  editstate
       -  Defines one of three possible edit states for modifiable
          items: readonly, writeonly, or readwrite. Default: readwrite.
    -  fontcolor
       -  Determines color of radio button fill pattern. Default: red
    -  fontinfo
       -  Defines font name, point size, and font characteristics for
          text portion of radio button. Defaults: Helvetica, 8, plain
    -  group
       -  Groups radio buttons together.
    -  help
       -  Points to help message for radio button.
    -  itemlocation
       -  Specifies location of radio button in page layout. Default:
          in body of page, under previous item in page definition,
          aligned along page's left margin
    -  label
       -  Defines label to appear above radio button and aligned with
          left edge.
    -  next
       -  Identifies item to receive focus when user tabs ahead from

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 72]


          current item. Default: depends on order in which page and
          item definitions occur within form definition
    -  size
       -  Specifies radio button's size in characters. Default: width
          1 character, height 1 character
    -  value
       -  Indicates radio button's status: on indicates chosen, off
          indicates not chosen. Default: not chosen

    Usage Notes

    1)  Group radio buttons by assigning them to the same group. Do
    this by including the group option in each radio button's
    definition, and using the same group reference in each case.

    2)  The value option contains the status indicator. It can be
    either on or off. The value on indicates a status of chosen. The
    value off indicates a status of not chosen. The default status is
    not chosen.

    3)  When the form opens, if no radio button has the status chosen,
    then the last radio button defined for the group becomes chosen.
    If multiple radio buttons are chosen, then only the last 'chosen'
    radio button retains that status.

    4)  The label option defines a label to appear above the radio
    button and aligned with its left edge.

    5)  When setting the size option of a radio button, the height and
    width of the bounding box will be based on the average character
    size for the font in use (set with the fontinfo option).

    6) The fontcolor option determines the color of the radio button
    fill pattern (default is red).

    Example

    This example shows a group of three radio buttons. The first radio
    button is the initial choice: the value option setting is on. The
    buttons all belong to the group search_Group.

NAME_RADIO = new radio
{
   value = "on";
   group = "search_Group";
   label = "Search by Name";
}
NUMBER_RADIO = new radio
{
   group = "search_Group";
   label = "Search by Number";
}
OCCUPATION_RADIO = new radio
{
   group = "search_Group";
   label = "Search by Occupation";

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 73]


}

    As shown here, only the chosen radio button needs to have a value
    option setting. The remaining radio buttons will receive the
    (default) value setting of off. 
------

   4.15  signature

    The signature item is used in conjunction with buttons to permit
    the authentication of the identity of users who sign a form to
    authorize its contents. A digital signature represents more than a
    handwritten signature. It creates an encrypted hash value that
    makes it impossible to modify the form without changing the hash
    value that the modified form would generate. To verify, one can
    generate the hash value and then see if it matches the one in the
    message. The signature item is created and becomes part of the
    form, when the form is signed.
    Available Options

    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  mimedata
       -  Contains actual data associated with signature. Default: none
    -  signdatagroups
       -  Identifies group or folder of enclosed files to be filtered
          for signature. Default: none
    -  signer
       -  Adds text similar to user's email signature, identifying who
          signed form. Default: none
    -  signformat
       -  Controls what system parameters are used to create the
          signature. Default: "application/uwi_form"
    -  signgroups
       -  Identifies groups of items to be filtered for signature.
          Default: none
    -  signitemrefs
       -  Identifies item references to be filtered for signature.
          Default: none
    -  signitems
       -  Identifies type of items to be filtered for signature.
          Default: none
    -  signoptionrefs
       -  Identifies option references to be filtered for signature.
          Default: none
    -  signoptions
       -  Identifies type of options to be filtered for signature.
          Default: none

    Usage Notes

    1)  The forms developer can change the following default set-up if
    desired: A Signature button that is associated with a valid digital
    signature will display the signer's identity. A Signature button
    associated with an invalid signature will display the word INVALID.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 74]


    A Signature button that is not associated with a signature will
    appear to be empty.

    2)  Fail if the item named by the Signature button s signature
    option already exists, if the Signature button is signed by any
    signature in the form, or if the signer s private key is
    unavailable for signing.

    3)  Filters allow you to indicate which items and options to keep
    and to omit. The explicit and implicit settings of an existing
    filter take precedence over an implications that might be drawn
    from an non-existing filter.

    4)  The forms developer must explicitly turn off the triggeritem
    and coordinates options, using the signoptions ref to do so. This
    ensures that the signature is not broken due to any alteration to
    the form:
    signoptions = ["omit", "triggeritem", "coordinates"];							

    5)  To use digital signatures, it is necessary for the user to
    obtain a digital signature certificate. The UFDL implementation
    currently supports digital signatures by using the Microsoft
    Cryptographic API. End-users can get the Cryptographic API by
    installing Internet Explorer v.4.0 (Windows 95) or NT Service Pack
    v.3.0 (NT). Digital signature certificates can be obtained from
    such certificate authorities as Verisign (www.verisign.com) and
    Thawte (www.thawte.com).

Example

    Example 1

    This example shows a Signature button with the basic elements. Its
    type is designated as "signature"; it omits triggeritem and
    coordinates options throughout to avoid breaking the signature; and
    the name of the signature is set as "mysig."

SIG1 = new button
{
	type = "signature";
     sigoptions = ["omit", "triggeritem", "coordinates"];
	signature = "mysig";
}

    Example 2

    This example shows the results that are generated after a form is
    signed by a hypothetical user, using the above Signature button.
    The signformat option controls what system parameters are used to
    create the signature. The signer option is generated automatically
    to identify who signed the form. 

mysig = new signature
{
	signformat = "application/uwi_form";
     signer = "John Smith, jsmith@acme.org"

   4.16  spacer

    The spacer item creates space between items on a form. It can be
    any size you specify. It is invisible.

    Available Options

    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  fontinfo
       -  Defines font name, point size, and font characteristics for
          label of spacer. Defaults: Helvetica, 8, plain
    -  itemlocation
       -  Specifies location of radio button in page layout. Default:
          in body of page, under previous item in page definition,
          aligned along page's left margin
    -  label
       -  Determines size of spacer, though not visible.
    -  size
       -  Specifies spacer's size in characters. Default: width=1
          character if label empty, otherwise label width, height=1
          character if label empty, otherwise label height

    Usage Notes

    1)  You can size a spacer either by giving it length and width
        dimensions (using size), by expanding the default size using
        the itemlocation option or by giving it a label. If you use a
        label, the spacer equals the size of the text you type into the
        label. The label does not appear; it is simply used to
        determine the spacer's size.

    2)  When setting the size option of a spacer, the height and width
        of the spacer will be based on the average character size for
        the font in use (set with the fontinfo option).

Example

    Example 1

    This example shows a spacer item that uses the size option to
    define the amount of space it will occupy.

3_SPACER = new spacer
{
   size = ["1", "3"];
}

    Example 2

    This example shows the spacer item that uses a label to define the
    amount of space it will occupy. This sizing technique is useful if

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 76]


    you want to create a spacer that is exactly the same size as a real
    label on the form.

WELCOME_SPACER = new spacer
{
   label = "Welcome to Information Line";
}
------

   4.17  tablet

    The tablet item creates a rectangular space or drawing object on
    the page where users can draw or write using the mouse pointer.
    This allows users to do such things as sign the form.

    To draw on a tablet, users hold down the left mouse button while
    moving the mouse pointer over the space. To erase the marks, users
    position the mouse over the tablet, hold down CONTROL and click the
    right mouse button.

    The tablet's background may be blank or composed of an image. The
    user draws on the background.

    Available Options

    -  Option
    -  Behavior
    -  active
       -  Specifies whether tablet is active or inactive. Default: on
    -  bgcolor
       -  Defines background color of radio button. Default: page
          background color
    -  bordercolor
       -  Defines color of border around tablet. Default: black
    -  borderwidth
       -  Defines width of tablet's border, in pixels. Default: 1 pixel
    -  editstate
       -  Defines one of three possible edit states for modifiable
          items: readonly, writeonly, or readwrite. Default: readwrite.
    -  fontcolor
       -  Determines pen color 
    -  fontinfo
       -  Defines font name, point size, and font characteristics for
          text portion of tablet. Defaults: Helvetica, 8, plain
    -  help
       -  Points to help message for tablet.
    -  image
       -  Associates tablet with data item. Default: none
    -  itemlocation
       -  Specifies location of tablet in page layout. Default: in body
          of page, under previous item in page definition, aligned
          along page's left margin
    -  justify
       -  Aligns lines of text within space tablet occupies.
    -  next
       -  Identifies item to receive focus when user tabs ahead from

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 77]


          current item. Default: depends on order in which page and
          item definitions occur within form definition
    -  size
       -  Specifies tablet's size in characters. Default: width 1
          character, height 1 character
    -  value
       -  Used to set initial size of tablet; otherwise, tablet sizes
          itself to size of text entered in value

    Usage Notes

    1)  A tablet item must contain an image option that associates it
    with a data item. The data item must also exist in the form. The
    user's drawing marks will be stored as image data in the data item.
	
	For example, this is the code necessary to create a blank tablet
	(that contains no image background) on a form.

sketch_tablet = new tablet
{
	fontcolor = ["blue"];
	size = ["30", "5"];
	image = "sketch_data";
}
...
sketch_data = new data
{
}

    2)  To place an image in a tablet's background, store the image
    data in the data item already associated with the tablet. Note
    that when the user draws on the tablet, the user's marks will be
    stored as part of the same image.

    For example, this piece of sample form code shows a tablet that
    contains an image called sign_data.

sign_tablet = new tablet
{
	fontcolor = ["blue"];
	size = ["30", "5"];
	image = "sign_logo";
}
...
sign_data = new data
{
	mimedata = "R0lGODdhYABPAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAYABA/"
"Art68+Y7im7ku2KkzXnOzh9v7qNw+k+TbDoLFTvCSPzMrSzTE+p"
"yai3YUk9R6hee2JFP2stju+uG0ptvdeKptb+cX8wfY1jdYU4KpdJw"
"44yAJEqcW28cA5M0oEKnqKasZwydrK9Wo6JTt9p5iwt8bi/b7E0"
"rvKixzbHJyrDq2uNggaXUs1NlLi36AW3AGv7VWhIPAzvdGi/vvr0Of"
"ft3Nrx89JewCQJYTirxi2PwgnRpNoMV5FIIboOnqTszFMhVI0yOz";
}

    3)  The fontcolor option determines the pen color.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 78]



    4)  The pen width is two pixels.

    5)  The value can be used to set the initial size of the tablet.
    If no size is indicated, and no mimedata exists, the tablet will
    size itself to the size of the text entered in the value.

    Example

    This example shows a blank tablet with a background color of pale
    green. It is 40 characters wide and 10 characters high.

users_signature = new tablet
{
   bgcolor = ["PaleGreen"];
   size = ["40", "10"];
   fontinfo = ["Courier", "12"];           // This governs the size.
   fontcolor = ["black"];                     // This governs pen color.
   image = "signature_data";
signature_data = new data
{
}
------

   4.18  toolbar

    The toolbar item allows you to define a toolbar for your page. A
    toolbar is a separate and fixed area at the top of the page. It
    functions much like a toolbar in a word processing application.
    Typically, you place items in the toolbar that you want users to
    see no matter what portion of the page they are viewing.

         The toolbar is visible no matter what portion of the page body
         is visible. However, if the toolbar is larger than half the
         form window, you will have to scroll to see everything it
         contains.

    Refer to the section 'Toolbars' on page 9 for more information on
    toolbars.

    Available Options

    You can use the following option with toolbar:
    -  bgcolor

    All options default to the characteristics of the page body.

    Usage Notes

    1)  The background color of the toolbar becomes the default
    background color for items in the toolbar.

    2)  Add items to the toolbar using the within modifier of the
    itemlocation option. Code the itemlocation option in each included
    item's definition.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 79]



    Example

    This example shows a toolbar that contains a label, a spacer, and
    two buttons.

    Here is the toolbar definition:

TOOL_BAR = new toolbar
{
   bgcolor = ["cornsilk"];
}
Here are the items belonging to the toolbar.
COMPANY_NAME = new label
{
   value = "My Company";
   itemlocation = [["within", "TOOL_BAR"]];
}
TB_SPACER = new spacer
{
   itemlocation = [["within", "TOOL_BAR"], ["below", "COMPANY_NAME"]];
} 
SUBMIT_BUTTON  = new button
{
   value = "Submit Form";
   type = "submit";
   url = ["http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/formProcessor"];
   itemlocation = [["within", "TOOL_BAR"], ["below", "TB_SPACER"]];
}
CANCEL_BUTTON  = new button
{
   value = "Cancel Form";
   type = "cancel";
   itemlocation = [["within","TOOL_BAR"], ["after", "SUBMIT_BUTTON"]];
}


   4.19  <custom item>

    Custom items allow form designers to add application specific
    information to the form definition. This is useful when submitting
    forms to applications requiring non-UFDL information. An example of
    non-UFDL information might be an SQL query statement.

    Available Options

    You can use all UFDL options and any custom options with custom
    items.

    Usage Notes

    1)  The naming conventions for a custom item are as follows:
        -  It must begin with an alphabetic character.
        -  It can contain any of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, $ and
           underscore.
        -  It must contain an underscore.

    Example

    This is an example of a custom item definition. It includes both a
    UFDL and a custom option.

STATUS_EVENT = new ma_event
{
   active = "off";
   ma_id = "UF45567 \t /home/users/preferences01";
}
------

5.0 UFDL Form Options

    An option defines a characteristic of a form, a page, or an item.
    An option definition is an assignment statement. The expression on
    the right hand side of the equal sign contains the option's
    setting. The syntax of an option definition statement is as follows:

    <option identifier> = <expression>;

    Note: The semicolon is mandatory and terminates the statement.

    Option identifier is a name that identifies the type of option. It
    can be a UFDL-defined option or a custom option. Examples of option
    identifier are: bgcolor, fontinfo, itemlocation, and size. See the
    section 'UFDL Form Options' on page 99 for a description of each
    option and its possible values.

    An expression specifies a value. An expression can be any of the
    following:
    -  a literal 
    -  a reference to another option definition in the form
    -  an operation
    -  an array specification

    Use an array specification for options requiring or permitting
    multiple values. The syntax of an array specification is as
    follows: [PD2]

    [<element1>, <element2>, ... <elementn>]

    Note: 'n' is the number of settings in the option.

    An element can be any of the following:
    -  an expression
    -  an element definition statement

    The brackets surrounding the array specification are mandatory
    even when there is only one element in the list.

    The evaluation of array elements is done in their order of position
    unless the elements have UFDL-defined variable names. See the
    following section for a discussion of variable names.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 81]



    Element Definition Statements

    The element definition statement allows you to assign a variable
    name to an array element. Variable names permit you to refer to the
    element by name rather than by its position in the array. The
    syntax of an element definition statement is:

    <variable> = <expression>

    See the section 'Option Definition' on page 20 for more information
    on expressions and arrays. 

Characteristics

    Options set for the form or a page are called characteristics. Form
    characteristics are global to the entire form. Page characteristics
    are global to the page on which they occur.

    Defining Form Characteristics

    Defining form characteristics is optional. It has the effect of
    setting characteristics that are global to the form. These
    characteristics override the defaults defined by the UFDL. Specific
    pages or items will override these global characteristics if the
    same option is set differently for that page or item.

    Use the reference global.global when referring to form
    characteristics.

Defining Page Characteristics

    Defining page characteristics is also optional. It has the effect
    of setting characteristics that are global to the page. These
    settings override the defaults defined by the UFDL and any form
    characteristics. Specific pages or items will override these global
    characteristics if the same option is set differently for that page
    or item..

    Use the reference global or <page tag>.global when referring to
    page characteristics.

Item Reference

    An item reference identifies a particular item instance. The syntax
    of an item reference is as follows:
    -  for items on the current page
	   <item tag>
    -  for items on another page
	   <page tag>.<item tag>

Data Type Designators

    The UFDL defines a set of data types to describe the variable data
    in option settings. Each option's description includes the
    necessary data type information.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 82]



    The UFDL uses the following data type designators:

    Data Type                              Description
    char          a single ASCII character
    string        a series of ASCII characters
    color         a color name or an RGB triplet representing the color
                  -  The syntax of an RGB triplet is: [<red>, <green>,
                     <blue>]. For example, the triplet for green is:
                     ["0", "255", "0"].
                  -  See Appendix B: 'Color Table' on page 217 for a
                     list of supported colors. The list contains the
                     color names and their RGB triplets.
    coordinate    whole number in the range 0 to 1,000 representing one
                  coordinate of a position
    integer       positive or negative whole number in the range
                  -32,768 to 32,767
    long int      whole number in the range 0 to 2,147,483,647
    short int     whole number in the range 0 to 255
    unsigned      whole number in the range 0 to 65,535 

Syntax Notation Conventions

    The following syntax notation conventions have been used in the
    sections following: 
    -  Names have been assigned to each expression on the right hand
       side of the assignment operator (=). The meaning and setting of
       each expression appear in a table below the syntax diagram. For
       example,

    fontinfo = [<font name>, <point size>, <weight>, <effects>, <form>];
    Note: <weight>, <effects>, and <form> are optional.

    Expression      Setting       Description
    <font name>     string        the name of the font
    <point size>    short int     the size of the font
    <weight>        "plain"       use plain face
                    "bold"        use bold face
    <effects>       "underline"   underline the text
    <form>          "italics"     use the italic form

    -  In the table, the Setting column indicates whether the
       expression requires variable data or a constant value. Variable
       data is represented by a data type; a constant value is
       represented by the required keyword. Data types appear in
       italics (for example, string); constants display in bold face
       (for example, underline).
    -  A set of mutually exclusive choices is represented by a list of
       settings beside an expression's name in the table. For example,
       in the fontinfo statement, the <weight> expression can be one of
       plain or bold.
    -  The syntax of an expression can take many forms. For example,
       the following formats are all valid:

       value = "Sample expression";

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 83]


       value = field_one.value;
       value = "Sample " +. field_two.value;

       As a consequence of the variation, syntax diagrams make no
       reference to an expression's format.

       See the section 'Option Definition' on page 20 for a discussion
       of expression formats.

    -  Repeating expressions are represented using an <opt1>, ...
       <optn> notation and an explanatory note. For example, 

       datagroup = [<datagroup reference1>, ... <datagroup
       referencen>];
       Note: Include a <datagroup reference> entry for each datagroup
       this item accesses.

    -  Optional expressions are noted in an explanatory note. For
       example, 

       fontinfo = [<font name>, <point size>, <weight>, <effects>,
       <form>];
       Note: <weight>, <effects> and <form> are optional.
------

   5.1  active

    The active option specifies whether an item is active or inactive.
    Inactive items do not respond to user input and, if possible,
    appear dimmed.

    For example, an inactive check box will be dimmed and the user will
    not be able to select or deselect the box.

    Syntax

    active = <status>;

    Expression      Setting       Description
    <status>        "on"          item is active
                    "off"         item is inactive

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 84]



    Example

    This sample specifies the item is active.

    active = "on";

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: on

    2)  Setting active to off would be similar to setting an edit state
    of readonly.
------

   5.2  bgcolor
   
    The bgcolor option defines the background color of a page or an
    item.

    Syntax

    bgcolor = [<color name>];
    bgcolor = [<RGB triplet>]; 

    Note: Either format is acceptable.

    Expression        Setting     Description
    <color name>      color       the color name
    <RGB triplet>     color       the RGB triplet. See 'Data Type
                                  Designators' on page 101 for the
                                  syntax of an RGB triplet.

    Available In

    -  box
    -  button
    -  check

    1)  Default: varies depending on the object
        Page: white
        Item: depends on the item type
        -  button items: gray (or grey)
        -  check, field, list, popup, and radio items: white
        -  all other items: the page background color
------

   5.3  bordercolor

    The bordercolor option defines the color of the border around the
    item. 

    Syntax

    bordercolor = [<color name>];
    bordercolor = [<RGB triplet>]; 

    Note: Either format is acceptable.

    Expression       Setting       Description
    <color name>     color         the color name
    <RGB triplet>    color         the RGB triplet. See 'Data Type
                                   Designators' on page 100 for the

    Usage Notes

    1)Default: black
------

   5.4  borderwidth

    The borderwidth option defines the width of an item's border. The
    unit of measurement is pixels. 

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 86]



    Syntax

    borderwidth = <width>;
    Expression    Setting       Description
    <width>       short int     the width of the border

    Available In

    -  box
    -  button
    -  field
    -  label
    -  list
    -  popup
    -  tablet
    -  page global characteristics
    -  form global characteristics

    Example

    This sample sets the border width to five pixels.

    borderwidth = "5";

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: varies depending on the item type
        -  box and label items: zero pixels
        -  all other visible items: one pixel
------

   5.5  coordinates

    The coordinates option records the position of the mouse pointer on
    an image. The image must exist in a button item. The recording
    occurs when a user selects (i.e. clicks) the button using the mouse
    pointer.

    The position is an intersection on an unseen grid overlaying the
    image. The points along each axis of the grid range from zero (0)
    through 1000 with position 0,0 occurring in the top, left corner.
    The coordinates map the intersection closest to the mouse pointer's
    position.

    Syntax

    coordinates = [<X_coordinate>, <Y_coordinate>];

    Expression        Setting          Description
    <X_coordinate>    coordinate       the coordinate on the X axis
    <Y_coordinate>    coordinate       the coordinate on the Y axis

    Available In


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 87]


    -  button

    Example

    When a user clicks on a button containing an image, a coordinates
    option statement is inserted into the button definition. The
    statement would look something like this. This particular setting
    indicates a position at the intersection of points 180 on the
    x-axis and 255 on the y-axis.

    coordinates = ["180", "255"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: none
------

   5.6  datagroup

    The datagroup option identifies a group or folder of enclosed
    files. Each enclosed file can belong to several datagroups, and
    each datagroup can contain several enclosed files.

    Syntax

    datagroup = [<datagroup reference1>, ... <datagroup referencen>];

    where <datagroup reference> is one of:
    -  <datagroup name> for datagroups on the current page
    -  <page tag>.<datagroup name> for datagroups on other pages

    Note: Include a <datagroup reference> entry for each datagroup this
    item accesses.
    Expression                 Setting      Description
    <datagroup reference>      string       identifies a datagroup

    Available In

    -  action
    -  button
    -  cell
    -  data

    Example

    If this sample were part of a data item definition, it would mean
    the data item belonged to the datagroups: Business_Letters,
    Personal_Letters, and Form_Letters. 

    If this sample were part of a action, button, or cell item, it
    would mean the user could store the enclosure in one of the three
    datagroups.

    datagroup = ["Business_Letters", "Personal_Letters",
    "Form_Letters"];

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 88]



    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: none

    2)  Used with items handling enclosures, datagroup lists the
    datagroups the item can access. Used with a data item, datagroup
    lists the datagroups to which the enclosure belongs. Enclosures are
    stored in data items.

    3)  Items that handle enclosed files perform enclose, extract,
    remove, and display actions. These actions types are set using the
    type option.

    4)  When a user selects an item that handles enclosed files, the
    list of datagroups appears. The user chooses the datagroup (or
    folder) with which to work. If the action is enclosing, the
    enclosed file is added to that datagroup. Otherwise, a list of
    files in the datagroup appears. The user chooses a file from the
    list.

    5)  The action of enclosing a file creates the data item, and
    stores the user's choice of datagroup (or folder) in the data
    item's datagroup option.
------

   5.7  delay

    The delay option delays the execution of an automatic action or
    specifies an automatic action repeat factor. Repeated actions stop
    when the page containing the action definition closes. Define
    automatic actions using an action item.

    Syntax

    delay = [<repeat factor>, <interval>];

    Expression        Setting     Description
    <repeat factor>   "repeat"    queue the action to repeat at the
                                  <interval> specified
                      "once"      perform the action once after the
                                  <interval> specified
    <interval>        integer     the frequency of repeated actions or
                                  the delay before performing single
                                  occurrence actions.
                                  The unit of measurement is seconds.
                      "-1"        perform the action before the page
                                  displays. Only valid with a repeat
                                  factor of once.

    Available In

    -  action

    Example


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 89]


    This sample sets the action to occur once, 15 minutes (900 seconds)
    after the page opens.

    delay = ["once", "900"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Defaults:
        -  repeat factor: once
        -  interval: zero seconds

        This means the action will occur when the page appears.

    2)  Repeating automatic actions is one method of creating a
    sparse-stated connection. It allows the form to indicate
    periodically to a server application that it is still running.

    3)  All actions with the same interval occur in the order they are
    defined in the page.
    4)  The page does not display while actions with an interval of -1
    are running.
------

   5.8  editstate

    The editstate option defines one of three possible edit states for
    modifiable items.

    Syntax

    editstate = <edit state>;

    Expression       Setting        Description
    <edit state>     "readonly"     users cannot change the item's
                                    setting
                     "writeonly"    users can change, but not see, the
                                    item's setting
                     "readwrite"    users can see and change the item's
                                    setting

    Available In

    -  check
    -  field
    -  list
    -  popup
    -  radio

    Example

    This sample sets the editstate to readonly.

    editstate = "readonly";

    Usage Notes

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 90]



    1)  Default: readwrite.

    2)  The writeonly setting applies only to fields. It causes all
    characters the user types to appear the same as the system password
    character.
    
    3)  The readonly setting permits users to scroll an item even
    though they may not update the item's contents.
------

   5.9  filename

    The filename option identifies the name of an enclosed file. This
    name appears in the list of enclosed files.

    Syntax

    filename = <file name>;

    Expression      Setting      Description
    <file name>     string       the name of the enclosed file

    Available In

    -  data

    Example

    This sample specifies the name of an enclosed file.

    filename = "std_logo.frm";

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: none

    2)  To ensure cross-platform compatibility, you should limit
    filenames to the following set of characters: lowercase letters
    from a to z, uppercase letters from A to Z, the integers 0 through
    9, and the underscore (_).

    3)  To ensure cross-platform compatibility, you should limit form
    names to a maximum of eight characters, followed by a .frm extension.
------

   5.10  fontcolor

    The fontcolor option defines the font color for the text or filler
    portion of an item. In radio and check items, fontcolor defines the
    color of the bullet and check, respectively. In line items,
    fontcolor defines the color of the line. In tablet items, fontcolor
    defines the pen color. In other items, it defines the text color.
    Syntax


Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 91]


    fontcolor = [<color name>];
    fontcolor = [<RGB triplet>]; 

    Note: Either format is acceptable.

    Expression      Setting      Description
    <color name>    color        the color name
    <RGB triplet>   color        the RGB triplet. See 'Data Type
                                 Designators' on page 100 for the
                                 syntax of an RGB triplet.

    Examples

    These samples both set the background color to chocolate.

    fontcolor = ["chocolate"];
    fontcolor = ["210", "105", "30"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: black
------

   5.11  fontinfo

    The fontinfo option defines the font name, point size, and font
    characteristics for the text portion of an item.

    Note:  The font selected for an item influences the item's size. 

    Syntax

    fontinfo = [<font name>, <point size>, <weight>, <effects>,
    <form>];

    Note: <weight>, <effects> and <form> are optional.

    Expression      Setting      Description
    <font name>     string       the name of the font
    <point size>    short int    the size of the font
    <weight>        "plain"      use a plain face
                    "bold"       use a bold face

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 92]


    <effects>       "underline"  underline the text
    <form>          "italic"     use the italic form

    -  box
    -  button
    -  check
    -  field
    -  label
    -  line
    -  list
    -  popup
    -  radio
    -  spacer
    -  tablet
    -  page global characteristics
    -  form global characteristics

    Example

    This sample sets the font information to Times 14, bold italic.

    fontinfo = ["Times", "14", "bold", "italic"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Defaults:
        -  font name: Helvetica
        -  point size: 8
        -  weight: plain
        -  effects: not underlined
        -  form: not italics

    2)  If any of the fontinfo settings are invalid, then the defaults
    will be used.

    3)The size option calculates item size using the font's average
    character width. Therefore, choice of font affects item width.

    4)  The UFDL supports the following fonts and font sizes:

        Fonts: Courier, Times, Symbol (??????), Helvetica, and
                  Palatino 
        Sizes: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48

        You can also use other fonts and font sizes if you wish.
        However, especially for cross-platform Internet applications,
        it is best to choose from the ones cited above since they are
        guaranteed to work.

    Format Flag

    You can specify any number of format flags in a format line. To
    see which format flags apply to each data type, see the cross
    reference table at the end of this section.

    The available format flags are:

   Format Flag                        Description
comma_delimit      Delimit the thousands by commas.
space_delimit      Delimit the thousands by spaces.

    presentation="yy/mm/dd"

    Available only when formatting dates, to create custom template for
    presentation of dates, using Y for year, M for month, and D for day

    -  Example: "date", presentation= "YY/MM/DD"
       - this could yield 98/12/23

    void

    Facilitate modification of format statement by a formula; ignored
    by formatting system

    Check Flag

    You can specify any number of edit checks in a format line. The
    edit checks you specify and any edit checks implied by the data
    type will be performed.

    To see which edit checks apply to each data type, see the cross
    reference table at the end of this section.

    Important: The UFDL specifies that fields be formatted before an
    edit check is performed. For example, if the field's data type is
    dollar and you specify the add_ds and comma_delimit format options,
    then the input 23000 becomes $23,000.00 before edit checks are
    applied. This can affect length and template checks. In this
    example, the length before formatting was 5 but it became 10 before
    edit checking.

    The available check flags are:

    Check Flag                      Description
optional                Input from the user is not mandatory.
mandatory               Input from the user is mandatory.
case_insensitive        Apply edit checks without regard to the case in
                        which the user enters the data.
range=["low","high"]    The field's value must be in the range
                        specified. The range can be alphabetic,
                        numeric, days of the week, days of the month,
                        or months.

                        Ranges cannot vary from high to low. For
                        example, 10 to one, the year 2000 to 1900, etc.
                        are invalid.
length=["min","max"]    Restrict the length of the formatted input data
                        to a minimum of "min" bytes and a maximum of
                        "max" bytes.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 96]


template=["a","b",...]  This is a list of formats permitted for the
                        field. There is no restriction on the number of
                        formats. Field contents must match one of the
                        formats in the list. You may use any of the
                        following wild card characters:
                        - ?  - represents any one (1) character?
                        - *  - represents any number of characters
                        - #  - represents any one (1) numeric character
                        - %  - represents any number of numeric
                               characters
                        - @  - represents any one (1) alphabetic
                               character
                        - !  - represents any number of alphabetic
                               characters (which can include none)
message="help"          Sets the error message that is displayed if the
                        user input fails the type checking. The default
                        message is, "This entry is invalid. Please try
                        again."
fail_checks             Forces failure of format statement.
ignore_checks           Causes all type checking checks to be ignored.

    Note: only checks are ignored, not datatype.

    Examples

    This example specifies a field containing integer data with a
    range of values from 10 to 1,000 inclusive, and formatted with
    commas separating the thousands.

    format = ["integer", "comma_delimit", range=["10", "1000"]];

    This example specifies a field that contains dollar data that is
    mandatory. An error message appears if the data is not entered
    correctly.

    format = ["dollar", "mandatory", message= "Entry incorrect-try
    again."];

    This example specifies a field in which date data will be
    formatted as day-of-month, month, and year (i.e. 15 June 1999).

    format = ["date", "long"];

    No checking or type checking is done; datatype is not checked
    either

    Usage Notes

    1)  If a format flag conflicts with the data type, the format
    flag will be ignored.

    2)  All edit checks specified will be applied to the input data.
    This may result in a field the user cannot change. For example, the
    combination of data type integer and check flag template="a*"
    creates such a situation. Data cannot be both an integer and begin
    with a letter.

    3)  Default Formatting
        -  Case remains unchanged.
        -  Numeric value format contains no thousands delimiter. This
           permits easy conversion of ASCII to integer format.
        -  Dollar value format uses two decimal places and no dollar
           sign.
        -  Zero is always positive.
        -  Day-of-week and month format is the abbreviated name with no
           punctuation. For example, the 2nd day of the week is always
           Mon; the first month is always Jan.
        -  The year format is long.
        -  The day_of_month is short.
        -  The date format uses the default day-of-month, month, and
           year formats organized in DMY order as in 25 Dec 1995. The
           'before Christ' era designator is B.C.
        -  The time format defaults to short if the input is between
           0:00 and 12:59, and to long otherwise.
    4)  Default Edit Checks
        -  All checking is case sensitive.
        -  The default edit checks combine the requirements of the data
           type with any formatting requirements (default or specific).
        -  If neither optional nor mandatory are specified, the rules
           that are specified will determine whether the user must enter
           information.

    5)  When applying a format to a combobox, list, or popup, the
    formatting will be applied to the value of each cell linked to
    the item. Those cells that do not pass the check will be
    flagged or filtered. If a cell passes the checks, its value
    will be replaced with a formatted value before the item is
    displayed. The label option for these cells will remain unaffected.

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 98]



    6)  When applying a format to a combobox, list, or popup, a cell
    with an empty value will fail all format checks but will still be
    selectable, even if input is mandatory. This allows users to erase
    their previous choice (which will also reset all formulas based on
    that choice). However, users will still need to select a valid cell
    before they can submit the form.

    7)  If any two comboboxes, lists, or popups use the same set of
    cells, they must apply the same formatting.

    8)  The void format type disables a format line completely through
    the use of a compute. void formats never fail regardless of the
    checks in the format statement.

    9)  The void format flag facilitates the modification of a format
    statement by a formula. It is ignored by the formatting system.

   5.13  group

    The group option provides a method of grouping items together.
    Items with the same group reference are considered members of the
    same group. Examples of grouped items are radio buttons and cells.

    Syntax

    group = <group reference>;

    where <group reference> is one of:
    -  <group name> for groups on the current page
    -  <page tag>.<group name> for groups on other pages

    Expression          Setting       Description
    <group reference>   string        identifies the group

    Available In
    
    -  cell
    -  combobox
    -  list
    -  popup
    -  radio

    Example

    This sample associates the item with the group coverage_type.

    group = "coverage_type";

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: none

    2)  List and popup items are populated with cells that have the
    same group reference as the item. It is possible to have several

Universal Forms Description Language                           [page 99]


    list and popup items with the same group reference. In this way,
    the same group of cells can populate more than one list or popup. 

    3)  All radio items having the same group reference will form a
    mutually exclusive group. 
------

   5.14  help 

    The help option points to the help message for the item. The item
    reference identifies the help item containing the help message.
    There can be many items pointing to the same help message.

    Syntax

    help = <item reference>;

    Expression         Setting     Description
    <item reference>   string      identifies the help item

    Available In

    -  button
    -  check
    -  field
    -  label
    -  list
    -  popup
    -  radio
    -  tablet

    Example

    This sample points to the help item general_help defined on the
    page called page_1.

    help = "page_1.general_help";
------

   5.15  image

    The image option associates an image with an item. The item
    reference identifies the data item containing the image. This
    image replaces any text label if the viewer is able to display
    images.

    Syntax

    image = <item reference>;

    Expression         Setting     Description
    <item reference>   string      identifies the data item

    Available In


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 100]


    -  button
    -  label
    -  tablet

    Example

    This sample points to the data item company_logo defined on the
    page called page_lst.

    image = "page_lst.company_logo";

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: none

    2)  Use this option to associate images with button and label
    items.
------

   5.16  itemlocation

    The itemlocation option serves three purposes:
    -  It specifies the location of an item in the page layout.
    -  If you use the extent setting, it will set the size of an item's
       bounding box.
    -  If you are using the relational positioning scheme, it may
       dynamically alter the size of an item.

    Each specification in the itemlocation option defines one aspect of
    an item's location or size.

    There are two different schemes you can use to position items on
    the page: an absolute positioning scheme and a relational
    positioning scheme. The absolute positioning scheme anchors the top
    left corner of an item to a particular pixel on the displayed page,
    whereas the relational positioning scheme places items on the page
    in relation to one another. Once you understand the two schemes you
    can combine them to gain the advantages of both schemes.

    For more information on the two schemes, see 'Absolute Positioning
    Scheme' and 'Relational Positioning Scheme', below.

    Note: You can combine the two methods of positioning, so that some
    items are positioned absolutely, and other items are positioned in
    relation to those absolute items.
    Syntax: 

    itemlocation = [[<specification1>], ... [<specificationn>]];

    where:
    
    (absolute positioning and extent modifier)
    -  <specification> is defined as: <modifier>,<x-coordinate>,
       <y-coordinate>


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 101]


    (relational positioning)
    -  <specification> is defined as: <modifier>, <item tag1>,
       <item tag2>

    Notes:
    i)   There is no restriction on the number of specifications.
    ii)  x-coordinate and y-coordinate may be negative only when the
    modifier is offset.
    iii) <item tag2> is valid only with the modifiers alignhorizbetween
    and alignvertbetween.

    Expression       Setting       Description
    <modifier>       (see below)   the type of modification to apply to
                                   the item's location or size

                     modifier is
                     absolute)     - the horizontal distance in pixels
                                   from the item's top left corner in

                                   offset position (with the modifier
                                   offset)
    <y-coordinate>   short         - the vertical distance in pixels

                     modifier is
                     absolute)     - the vertical distance in pixels
                                   from the item's top left corner in

                                   new offset position (with the
                                   modifier offset)
    <item tag>       string        identifies the reference point item

    Modifiers

    There are four types of modifiers:
    -  position modifiers - used to position an item
    -  alignment modifiers - used to align one edge of an item
       (relational positioning only)
    -  expansion modifiers - used to alter an item's size (relational
       positioning only)
    -  the extent modifier - used to set a pixel based size for an
       item (both relational and absolute positioning)

    Position Modifiers

    For the Absolute Positioning Scheme:

    Modifier                          Description
    absolute     Place top left corner of item on the pixel noted in
                 the x-coordinate and y-coordinate settings.
    offset       Place item so that it is offset from its original
                 location by the measurement specified in the
                 x-coordinate and y-coordinate settings.


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 102]


    The extent modifier, listed later in this section, can also be used
    with absolute positioning.

    For the Relational Positioning Scheme:

    Note: A specification containing the within modifier must be the
    first specification in the list.

    Modifier                          Description
    above        Place item a small distance above reference pointitem;
                 align left edges.
    after        Place item a small distance after reference point
                 item; align top edges.
    before       Place item a small distance before reference point
                 item; align top edges.

                 x coordinate, and as many pixels tall as the y
                 coordinate.

    Absolute Positioning Scheme

    This scheme anchors an item to a particular coordinate on the
    visible page. The coordinate is a measurement in pixels of the
    distance between the top left corner of the form and the item's
    top left corner.

    The itemlocation line describing the label in the picture above
    would look like this:

    itemlocation = [["absolute", "60", "60"]];

    The absolute positioning scheme also allows you to offset an item
    from its original position, by a particular number of pixels. This
    is a quick way to create an indented layout on your form.

    It is valid to offset an item in any of these four directions:
    right, left, up, down. Since the offset is measured by a pixel grid
    and is represented with x and y coordinates, the directions left
    and up are measured as negative distances. For example, to outdent
    the Last Name field in the above diagram, so that its left edge is
    further left than the label's, the x measurement would be negative,
    as in -15.

    You can offset an item from either:
    -  Its original absolute position. For example,

    itemlocation = [["absolute", "60", "100"],
                      ["offset", "15", "20"]];

    Its original relational position. For example,
    
    itemlocation = [["below", "persInfo_label"],
                      ["offset", "15", "20"]];

    Caution

    An absolute positioning scheme is not a cross-platform solution-nor

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 105]


    even a solution guaranteed to make forms appear the same under
    different video cards or in both small font and large font modes.
    The sizes of many UFDL form items are measured in characters. For
    example, a field that is 60 x 1 in size, is 60 characters long and
    1 character high. Because different platforms and video cards use
    differently sized fonts, even for the so-called cross-platform
    fonts, an item's actual size (in pixels) may change from one
    platform to another as the font it is measured in changes size. If
    you rely on spacing items on your form using absolute positioning,
    which fastens an item to a particular pixel, some items may appear
    overlapped on some platforms.

    To ensure that your forms appear the same on any platform, and
    under any video card or font mode, use relational positioning.

    Relational Positioning Scheme

    Relational positioning allows you to place an item relative to the
    location of another item. It also allows you to specify an item's
    size relative to the size and location of other items. The other
    items (called reference point items) must be defined before they
    can be used in an itemlocation statement.

    When you use the relational positioning scheme, the first external
    item you place on the form appears in the top left corner. It
    cannot be placed in relation to any other item, since no other
    items exist. All subsequent items can be placed in relation to
    items that appear before them in the form's description. If you do
    not specify any relational position for an item, it will appear
    below the previous item, with its left edge against the page's left
    edge.

    Itemlocation can only reference items on the same page as the item
    being defined. If the item being defined is in a toolbar, the
    referenced items must be in the same toolbar.

    The Extent Modifier

    The extent modifier allows you to set an absolute size for an item
    in pixels. When you specify an extent, the item's top left corner
    will stay where it is, and the item will be resized so that it is
    as many pixels wide as the x value and as many pixels in height as
    the y value.

    Note: Itemlocation uses the bounding boxes of the defined and
    referenced items to determine location and size. 

Examples

    Example 1 - Absolute Positioning

    This sample places a label on the page so that its top left corner
    is 20 pixels in from the page's left edge, and 30 pixels down from
    the top of the page.


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 106]


persInfo_label = new label
{
	value = "Personal Information";
	itemlocation = [["absolute", "20", "30"]];
}

    Example 2 - Offsetting an Item

    These samples show two ways in which to offset a field below the
    label in example one. The first sample shows how to do so using
    only the absolute positioning scheme. The second sample shows how
    to do so using both relational and absolute positioning schemes.

lastName_field = new field
{
label = "Last Name";
itemlocation = [["absolute", "20", "100"],
		["offset", "10", "10"]];
}


lastName_field = new field
{
label = "Last Name";
itemlocation = [["below", "persInfo_label"],
		["offset", "10", "10"]];
}


    Note that the item is offset from its original position, not from
    other items. It's not a good idea to offset items using strictly
    absolute positioning (sample one). Use relational positioning if
    possible (sample two). For more information on the dangers of
    absolute positioning, see the Caution on page 134.

    Example 3 - Relational Positioning

    Sample 3.1

    This sample aligns the vertical center of an item between the
    bottom edge of the item label_one and the top edge of the item
    label_two.

    itemlocation = [["alignvertbetween", "label_one", "label_two"]];

    Sample 3.2

    This sample aligns the item's left edge with the center of item
    the_firm and expands the right edge to align with the right edge of
    the same reference item (the_firm).

    itemlocation = [["alignl2c", "the_firm"], ["expandr2r",
    "the_firm"]];

    Sample 3.3


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 107]


    This sample assigns an item to the toolbar main_toolbar and
    positions it under the company logo company_logo.

    itemlocation = [["within", "main_toolbar"], ["below",
    "company_logo"]];

    Example 4 - Extent

    Sample 4.1

    This sample shows an extent setting on a field that has been placed
    using absolute positioning. The field is first placed at an x-y
    coordinate of 10, 10. It is then sized to be 300 pixels wide and 30
    pixels high.

    itemlocation = [["absolute", "10", "10"], ["extent", "300", "30"]];

    Sample 4.2

    The second sample shows an extent setting on a label that has been
    placed using relational positioning. The label is first placed
    below a field, and is then sized to be 100 pixels wide and 20
    pixels high.

    itemlocation = [["below", "field_1"], ["extent", "100", "20"]];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default item location:
        -  in the body of the page
        -  under the previous item in the page definition
        -  aligned along the left margin of the page

        Default bounding box size:
        See 'Appendix B: Default Sizes' on page 173

    2)  Itemlocation overrides size. If the itemlocation affects the
    size of the item and the size option has also been set for the
    item, the itemlocation will determine the size.

    3)An item's vertical center is halfway between the top and bottom
    edges. The horizontal center is halfway between the left and right
    edges.

    4)See the following sections for more information on using
    itemlocation:
    -  'Item Placement' on page 18
    -  'Item Size' on page 16

    4)  To offset an item by shifting it to the right or down the page,
    specify the offset distance using positive integers. To offset an
    item by shifting it to the left or up the page, specify the offset
    distance using negative integers.

    5)  Use absolute positioning carefully. See the Caution on page 134

   5.24 mimedata

    The mimedata option contains the actual data associated with a data
    item. It can be binary data or the contents of an enclosed file.
    The data is encoded in base64 format, so that even forms containing
    binary dta can be viewed in a text editor. When the data is needed
    by the form, it is decoded automatically from base64 back to its
    native format.

    Syntax

    mimedata = <data>;

    Expression     Setting      Description
    <data>         string       the binary data or enclosed file
                                contents

    Available In

    -  data
    -  signature

    Example

    This sample assigns some encoded data to the mimedata option.
    Notice the quotation marks surrounding each segment of the data.

    mimedata =
    "R0lGODdhYABPAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAYABPAAAC/4SPqcvtD02Y"
    "Art68+Y7im7ku2KkzXnOzh9v7qNw+k+TbDoLFTvCSPzMrS2YzmTE+";

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: none

    2)  Base64 encoding transforms the data into a format that can be
    processed easily by text editors, email applications, etc.
    Converting data to base64 format ensures the resulting string
    contains no characters requiring an escape sequence.

    3)  mimedata also reflects the encoded contents of a signature
    item.
------

   5.25 mimetype

    The mimetype option defines the MIME type of the data stored in a
    data item.

   5.26 next

    The next option identifies the item to receive focus when a user
    tabs ahead from the current item. If the specified item is on
    another page, the new page appears with the item in focus. Only
    modifiable items can receive focus.

    See the section 'Defining Tabbing and Paging' on page 31 for more
    information on tabbing.

    Syntax

    next = <item reference>;

    -  page global characteristics
    -  form global characteristics

    Example

    This sample points to the item address_field. When users tab ahead
    from the current item, the item identified as address_field will
    receive focus.

    next = "address_field";

    Usage Notes
    1)  Default tabbing order: depends on the order in which page and
    item definitions occur within the form definition. The sequence is:
    -  first page to display: first page defined in the form
       first item to receive focus: first modifiable item defined for
       the body of the first page 
    -  subsequent items to receive focus: each modifiable item on the
       page in the order you define them

    When you tab past the last item on the page, the first modifiable
    item in the page's toolbar receives focus. If there is no toolbar,
    focus returns to the first item.

    2)  Placing the next option in form characteristics defines the
    first page to appear, and the first item to receive focus when the
    form opens. Placing next in page characteristics defines the first
    item to receive focus when the page appears. 

    3)  If the next option identifies form or page characteristics,
    focus moves to the item defined to receive focus when the form or
    page appears. The form characteristics reference is global.global.
    The page characteristics reference is global for the current page
    or <page tag>.global for another page
------

   5.27 previous 

    The previous option identifies the item to receive focus when a
    user tabs backwards, using SHIFT + TAB, from the current item. If
    the current item has a previous option, the item indicated in that

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 116]


    option is next in the reverse tab order. If the current item has
    no previous option, the previous item in the build order that can
    receive the input focus is next in the reverse tab order.

    See section 2.4n 'Defining Tabbing and Paging' for more information
    on tabbing.

    Syntax

    previous = <item reference>;

    Expression        Setting     Description
    <item reference>  string      identifies the item to receive focus
                                  next

    Available In

    -  form global characteristics

    Example

    This sample points to the item date_field. When users tab back from
    the current item, the item identified as date_field will receive
    focus.

    previous = "date_field";

    Usage Notes

    2)  Default tabbing order: depends on the order in which page and
    item definitions occur within the form definition. The sequence is:
    -  first page to display: first page defined in the form
    -  first item to receive focus: first modifiable item defined for
       the body of the first page 
    -  subsequent items to receive focus: each modifiable item on the
       page in the reverse order you define them

    When you tab back past the first item on the page, the last
    modifiable item in the page's toolbar receives focus. If there is
    no toolbar, focus returns to the last item defined in the page.

    4)  Placing the previous option in form characteristics defines the
    first page to appear, and the first item to receive focus when the
    form opens. Placing previous  in page characteristics defines the
    first item to receive focus when the page appears. 

        If the previous option identifies form or page characteristics,
        focus moves to the item defined to receive focus when the form

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 117]


        or page appears. The form characteristics reference is
        global.global. The page characteristics reference is global for
        the current page or <page tag>.global for another page.
------

   5.28 printsettings

    The printsettings option determines the settings that will be used
    when the form is printed. You can allow the user to change these
    defaults, or set the form so that it will always follow the defaults.

    Syntax

    printsettings = [<page list>, <dialog settings>];

    Notes:
    i) All settings are optional.

    Expression         Setting       Description
    <page list>        (see below)   the list of pages that should be
                                     printed
    <dialog settings>  (see below)   determines whether the print
                                     dialog is shown, and which
                                     settings should be used when
                                     printing (for example, paper
                                     orientation and number of copies)

    Available In

    -  action
    -  button
    -  cell
    -  page global characteristics
    -  form global characteristics

    Page List

    The page list uses the following syntax:

    pages=["keep"|"omit", "<page tag 1>", "<page tag 2>", ...]

    The settings for the page list work as follows:

    Setting                          Description
    keep         The pages listed will be printed. Any other pages will
                 not.
    omit         The pages listed will not be printed. Any other pages
                 will.
    <page tag>   The list of page tags indicates which pages should be
                 either kept or omitted.

    Dialog Settings

    The dialog settings use the following syntax


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 118]


    dialog=[active="on"|"off", orientation="portrait"|"landscape",
    copies="1"]

    The settings work as follows:

    Setting                          Description
    active        When "on", the print dialog will be displayed before
                  the form is printed, allowing the user to change the
                  settings. When "off", the dialog will not be shown
                  and the form will be printed immediately.
    orientation   Determines whether the form will be printed in
                  "landscape" or "portrait" orientation.
    copies        Determines the number of copies that will be printed.
    printpages    See below.

    Example

    This sample omits "page2" from printing, sets the form to print in
    landscape orientation, and causes two copies of the form to be
    printed. The user is able to change all of these settings.

    printsettings=[pages=["omit", "page2"], dialog=["on",
    orientation="landscape", copies="2"]];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default Page List: the page list will default to keeping all
    pages in the form.

    2)Default Dialog Settings: the dialog will default to being "on",
    and will print one copy of all pages in the form in a portrait
    orientation. By default, the user will be able to change all of
    these settings.
------

   5.29 saveformat

    The saveformat option specifies what format a form should be saved
    in. A UFDL form can be saved in UFDL format, compressed UFDL
    format, or HTML format.

    UFDL format saves the entire form definition, including the user
    input.

    Compressed UFDL format saves the entire form description as a
    compressed file using a gzip compression algorithm.

    HTML format saves the form as a series of assignment statements for
    each modifiable item, equating the item reference with the item's
    value. The only items included in the save are custom items and the
    following modifiable items: check, field, list, popup, radio.

    Syntax

    saveformat = <MIME type>;


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 119]


    Expression    Setting                              Description
    <MIME_type>   "application/uwi_form"               use UFDL format
                  "application/uwi_form;content-       use compressed
                                   encoding=\"gzip\""  UFDL formal
                  "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  use HTML format

    Note: You cannot specify that HTML format files be compressed.

    Available In

    -  button
    -  cell
    -  form global characteristics

Example

    Example 1 - HTML format in a button

    This example shows how to use saveformat in a save button.

save_button = new button
{
	type = "save";
	saveformat = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
}

    When a user clicks this button, the form will be converted to HTML
    format (see Usage Note 3 below) and saved to the user's drive.

    Example 2 - Compressed UFDL format in form global characteristics

    This example shows how to use saveformat as a form global
    characteristic and to specify that the saved form be compressed.

version = "3.2.0";
bgcolor = ["ivory"];
saveformat = "application/uwi_form; content-encoding = \"gzip\"";

page_1 = new page
{
...

    Any time a user saves this form, it will be saved in compressed
    UFDL format.

    A saveformat setting as a form global characteristic applies to all
    save actions for the form. You can override the global setting for
    specific save actions by coding a different saveformat option into
    the item that initiates the save action. For example,

version = "3.2.0";
bgcolor = ["ivory"];
saveformat = "application/uwi_form; content-encoding = \"gzip\"";

page_1 = new page

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 120]


{
	save_button = new button
	{
	   type = "save";
	   value = "Save Form";
	   saveformat = "application/uwi_form";
	}

    When the user saves the form by clicking the Save Form button, it
    will be saved as an uncompressed UFDL form.

    Note that the quotation marks around gzip must be escaped.

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: UFDL format (not compressed)

    2)  You can include this option as a form global option and in the
    definitions of items that trigger save actions. These are button or
    cell items that have a type option setting of save.

    3)  HTML Format by Item Type

        The general syntax of a form saved in HTML format is:

        <item reference>=<value>&< item reference>=<value>&...

        Note: the ampersand separates form items.
 
    The syntax of items saved in HTML format by type:
    Item Type                               HTML Format
    check           <item tag>=<value option setting>
    field           <item tag>=<value option setting>
    list                      <item tag>=
                  <value option setting of selected cell>
                   Note: <item reference> identifies the list.
    popup                     <item tag>=
                  <value option setting of selected cell>
                   Note: <item reference> identifies the popup.
    radio                <group option setting>=
                       <item tag of selected radio>
    <custom>       <item tag>=<value option setting>

    Note: combo boxes cannot be saved in HTML format.

    Substitutions and Omissions:

    -  Only modifiable items are saved as HTML data. You cannot save a
       form in HTML format and expect to view it as a form again. It
       is saved as a string of item tags and their associated values.
    -  Spaces in the value are replaced by the plus sign (+).
    'Two words' becomes 'Two+words'
    -  The membership operator in item and group references is replaced
       by a minus sign.
    'page_one.age_group' becomes 'page_one-age_group'

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 121]


    -  Page tags are removed from item and group references in single
       page forms.
    -  Check boxes and radio buttons with a value option setting of off
       are omitted.
    -  Entries resulting in an empty string on the right hand side of
       the assignment statement are omitted. This occurs when the
       referenced option setting is empty or the option definition is
       missing.

   5.32 signature

    The signature option is used in conjunction with the button item to
    establish the UFDL item name by which a particular digital
    signature will be identified.

    Syntax

------

   5.33 signdatagroups

    The signdatagroups option specifies which datagroups are to be
    filtered for a particular digital signature. (Filtering means
    either keeping or omitting data.) Keeping a datagroup means keeping
    or omitting all items containing that datagroup name, even if they
    were added after the form was created. This is how enclosures are
    signed.

    Syntax

    signdatagroups = [<datagroup filter>, <datagroup reference>, ...
    <datagroup referencen>];

    Note: The number of <datagroup reference> entries is optional.
    Expression             Setting     Description

                                       <datagroup reference> list from
                                       the signature; include those not
                                       in list
    <datagroup reference>  string      identifies a datagroup

    Available In

    -  button
    -  signature

    Example

    This example specifies a signdatagroups option that keeps the
    datagroup called "Business_Letters". 

    signdatagroups = ["keep", "Business_Letters"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: keep

    2)  Since enclosed files can belong to several datagroups, and
    datagroups can contain several enclosed files, care must be
    exercised when setting up signdatagroups options to ensure that
    only the desired datagroups are filtered.

   5.34 signer


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 124]


    The signer option identifies who signed a particular form.

    Syntax

    signer = <identity of user>;

    Expression          Setting     Description
    <identity of user>  string      identity of user 

    Available In

    -  button
    -  signature

    Example

    In this example, signer is similar to a user's email signature,
    clearly identifying who signed the form. 

    signer = "John Smith jsmith@acme.org";

    Usage Notes

    1)  The setting of the signer option varies, depending on where the
    signature is from. Using different certificate authorities may
    produce different results.

    2)  The signer option is automatically generated by the signature
    button when the user signs the form. It goes automatically into
    both the signature button code and the signature code. No manual
    coding is required. 
------

   5.35 signgroups

    The signgroups option specifies which groups of items are to be
    filtered for a particular digital signature. (Filtering means
    either keeping or omitting items.) Examples of grouped items are
    radio buttons and cells.

    Syntax

    signgroups = [<group filter>, <group reference>, ... <group
    referencen>];

    Note: The number of <group reference> entries is optional.

    Expression          Setting      Description
    <group filter>      "keep"       include groups of items in the
                                     <group reference> list with the
                                     signature; omit those not in list
                        "omit"       omit groups of items in the <group
                                     reference> list from the
                                     signature; include those not in
                                     list

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 125]


    <group reference>   string       identifies a group of items

    Available In

    -  button
    -  signature

    Example

    This example shows a signgroups setting that omits the groups of
    items named "yesnoradiobuttons" and "monthlypaycells".

    signgroups = ["omit", "yesnoradiobuttons", "monthlypaycells"];

    Usage Notes

    1)Default: keep

    2) It is possible to have several list or popup items with the same
    group reference, as these are populated with cells that have the
    same group reference as the item which contains them. Therefore,
    when setting up signgroups options, caution must be exercised in
    making group references to list or popup items which may be
    populated by the same group of cells.

    3)See Precedence in Filters for further information on filtering.
------

   5.36 signitemrefs 

    The signitemrefs option specifies which individual items are to be
    filtered for a particular digital signature. (Filtering means
    either keeping or omitting data.)

    Syntax

    signitemrefs = [<item filter>, <item reference>, ... <item
    referencen>];

    Note: The number of <item reference> entries is optional.

    Expression          Setting     Description
    <item filter>       "keep"      include items in the <item
                                    reference> list with the signature;
                                    omit those not in list
                        "omit"      omit items in the <item reference>
                                    list from the signature; include
                                    those not in list
    <item reference>    string      specifies the item to be filtered

    Available In
    
    -  button
    -  signature

    Example

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 126]



    This sample sets the signitemrefs option to omit two fields from
    the digital signature.

    signitemrefs = ["omit", "field1", "page1.field2"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: keep

    2)  Since all items have a name and type, signitemrefs filters are
    always applicable.

    3)  signitemrefs filters take precedence over signitems filters.

    4)  See Precedence in Filters for further information on filtering.
------

   5.37 signitems

    The signitems option specifies which types of items are to be
    filtered for a particular digital signature. (Filtering means
    either keeping or omitting data.)

    Syntax

    signitems = [<item filter>, <item type>, ... <item typen>];

    Note: The number of <item type> entries is optional.
    Expression      Setting     Description
    <item filter>   "keep"      include types of items in the <item
                                type> list with the signature; omit
                                those not in list
                    "omit"      omit types of items in the <item type>
                                list from the signature; include those
                                not in list
    <item type>     string      specifies the type of item to be
                                filtered

    Available In

    -  button
    -  signature

    Example

    This sample sets the signitems option to keep the following types
    of items with the signature: boxes, buttons, and fields.

    signitems = ["keep", "box", "button", "field"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default:  keep


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 127]


    2)  A signitems setting can be overridden by a signoptions setting,
    in terms of the order of precedence.

    3)  See Precedence in Filters for further information on filtering.
------

   5.38 signoptionrefs

    The signoptionrefs option specifies which individual options are to
    be filtered for a particular digital signature. (Filtering means
    either keeping or omitting a piece of data.) This option should be
    used in conjunction with a signoptions option also appearing in the
    filter.

    Syntax

    signoptionrefs = [<option filter>, <option reference>, ...
    <option referencen>];

    Note: The number of <option reference> entries is optional.

    Expression           Setting    Description
    <option filter>      "keep"     include options in the <option
                                    reference> list with the signature;
                                    omit those not in list
                         "omit"     omit options in the <option
                                    reference> list from the signature;
                                    include those not in list
    <option reference>   string     specifies the option to be filtered

    Available In

    -  button
    -  signature

    Example

    This example specifies a signoptionrefs setting that keeps a
    particular field with the digital signature.

    signoptionrefs = ["keep", "page1.field1.value"];
							  
    Note: the page name can be dropped if the option in question is
    on the same page, but the item name should not be dropped.

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default:  keep

    2)  Note that unlike signoptions, the signoptionrefs filter can
    cause an item to be included even if the item filters would
    normally omit the item. This is necessary in order to ensure that
    the hashed text is in valid UFDL format.

    3)  Signoptionrefs filters take precedence over signoptions
    filters.

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 128]

   5.39 signoptions 

    The signoptions option specifies which types of options are to be
    filtered for a particular digital signature. (Filtering means
    either keeping or omitting a piece of data.)

    Syntax
    signoptions = [<option filter>, <option type>, ... <option typen>];

    Note: The number of <option type> entries is optional.

    Expression       Setting     Description
    <option filter>  "keep"      include types of options in the
                                 <option type> list with the signature;
                                 omit those not in list
                     "omit"      omit types of options in the <option
                                 type> list from the signature; include
                                 those not in list
    <option type>    string      specifies the type of option to be
                                 filtered

    Available In

    -  button
    -  signature

    Example

    This example shows a signoptions setting that omits two types of
    options from the digital signature.

    signoptions = ["omit", "url", "printsettings"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default:  keep

    2)  One signoptions setting that must always be specified is as
    follows:

    signoptions = ["omit", "triggeritem", "coordinates"];

    This setting ensures that the signature will not be broken due to
    an alteration to the form.

    3)  signoptions can be overridden by a signoptionrefs setting.

    4)  See Precedence in Filters for more on filtering.
------

   5.40 size

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 129]



    The size option specifies an item's size. It does not include
    external labels, borders or scroll bars. These are part of the
    bounding box size which is calculated automatically. The size unit
    of measurement is characters.

    Examples of item size are the input area in a field item or the
    height and width of the label in label and button items.

    See 2.4 e 'Item Size' for a discussion of item and bounding box
    sizes.

    Syntax

    size = [<width>, <height>];

    Expression    Setting     Description
    <width>       short int   the horizontal dimension of the item
    <height>      short int   the vertical dimension of the item

    Available In

    -  box
    -  button
    -  check
    -  field
    -  label
    -  line
    -  list
    -  popup
    -  radio
    -  spacer
    -  tablet

    Example

    This sample sets the item's size to 80 characters wide by five
    characters high.

    size = ["80", "5"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  Defaults: See 'Appendix B: Default Sizes' on page 173

    2)  Size and Font:

    The width may not always accommodate the number of characters you
    specify. The calculation to determine actual width is:
    -  'average character width for the item's font' X <width>
    -  This will only exactly match the number of characters the item
       can display horizontally when the font is mono-spaced (like
       Courier).

    3)  If either the height or the width is invalid, the default item

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 130]


    size will be used. A dimension of zero (0) is invalid for all items
    except line.

    4)  The item and bounding box sizes can be changed by using
    itemlocation with an expansion or extent modifier.
------

   5.41 thickness

    The thickness option specifies the thickness of a line. The unit of
    measurement is pixels.

    Syntax

    thickness = <thickness>;

    Expression    Setting     Description
    <thickness>   short int   the thickness of the line

    Available In

    -  line

Example

    Example 1

    This sample defines a horizontal line 40 characters long and five
    pixels thick.

    size = ["40", "0"];
    thickness = "5";

    Example 2

    This sample defines a vertical line 20 characters long and 10
    pixels thick.

    size = ["0", "20"];
    thickness = "10";

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: one pixel

    2)  Use size to define the dimension of a line in one direction
    (height or width) and thickness to define the dimension in the
    other direction. The dimension thickness defines must be set to
    zero in size.

    3)  The line's thickness can be changed by using itemlocation with
    an expansion modifier for the dimension that thickness describes.
------

   5.42 transmitdatagroups


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 131]


    This is one of the transmit-family of options that allow you to
    filter form submissions. This option lists which datagroups of
    items should be kept or omitted from a transmission.

    For example, if transmitdatagroups specifies that the datagroup
    called enclosures should be kept in the transmission, then all
    items with a datagroup setting of enclosures will be transmitted
    (unless other filters of greater precedence exclude them).

    This filter applies only to items for which it is valid to have a
    datagroup option (action, button, cell, data).

    For details on the order of precedence of filters, see 2.5h "Order
    of Precedence of Filters".

    Syntax

    transmitdatagroups = [<transmit flag>, <datagroup identifier1>, ...
    <datagroup identifiern>];

    Note: There may be zero or more <datagroup identifier> entries.

    Expression              Setting     Description
    <transmit flag>         "keep"      keep items with a datagroup
                                        setting specified in the
                                        <datagroup identifier> list;
                                        omit those with a datagroup
                                        setting not included in the
                                        list
                            "omit"      omit items with a datagroup
                                        setting specified in the
                                        <datagroup identifier> list;
                                        keep those with a group setting
                                        not in the list
    <datagroup identifier>  string      the name of a datagroup setting

    Available In

    -  action
    -  button
    -  cell

    Examples

    This sample specifies that only the items with a datagroup setting
    of enclosures should be transmitted. 

    transmitdatagroups = ["keep", "enclosures"];

    This sample specifies that all items except those with a datagroup
    setting of other should be kept in the transmission.

    transmitdatagroups = ["omit", "other"];

    Usage Notes

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 132]



    1)  The default is to keep all datagroups in the form.

    For details on the order of precedence of filters, see 2.5h "Order
    of Precedence of Filters".
------

   5.43 transmitformat

    The transmitformat option specifies the format of the form data
    submitted to a processing application. A UFDL form can submit data
    in UFDL format, compressed UFDL format, or in HTML format.

    UFDL format is the entire form definition, including user input,
    unless you use the options transmit, transmititems, and
    transmitoptions to omit some items and options from the form
    submission.

    HTML format is just an assignment statement for each item equating
    the item reference with the item's value. The only items included
    are modifiable items, custom items, and items with a transmit
    option setting of all.

    If you specify that a UFDL format submission should be compressed,
    it will be compressed using a gzip compression algorithm.

    Note: Form and page global characteristics are sent only if the
    format is UFDL.

    Syntax

    transmitformat = <MIME_type>;

    Expression    Setting                              Description
    <MIME_type>   "application/uwi_form"               use UFDL format
                  "application/uwi_form;content-       use compressed
                                   encoding=\"gzip\""  UFDL formal
                  "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  use HTML form
                                                       format

    Note: You cannot specify that data in HTML form format be
    compressed.

    Available In

    -  action
    -  button
    -  cell
    -  form global characteristics

Examples

    Example 1 - UFDL format

    This example shows a button which, when clicked, will submit the
    form in UFDL format.

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 133]



send_button = new button
{
	type = "done";
	url = ["mailto:user@host.domain"];
	transmitformat = "application/uwi_form";
}

    When a user clicks the button, the entire form definition will be
    submitted, unless other transmit options specify a partial
    submission.

    Example 2 - Compressed UFDL format specified in form global

    This example shows how to use the transmitformat option as a form
    global option. Here, it specifies that data should be submitted in
    compressed UFDL format.
version = "3.2.0";
bgcolor = ["ivory"];
transmitformat = "application/uwi_form; content-encoding=\"gzip\"";

page_1 = new page
{
...

    When a submit or done action is activated in the form, the data
    will be sent in compressed UFDL format. When transmitformat appears
    as a form global characteristic, it applies to all submissions from
    the form. You can override it for a particular submission if you
    place a transmitformat setting in the item that initiates the
    submission.

    Note that the quotation marks around gzip must be escaped.

    Example 3 - HTML form format

    This sample shows an automatic action that submits form data in
    HTML form format.

status_action = new action
{
	type = "submit";
	url = ["http://www.host.domain/cgi-bin/recvStatus"];
	transmitformat = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
	delay = ["repeat", "180"];
}

    Every 180 seconds, the form definition will be converted to HTML
    form format as specified in Usage Note 4. Other transmit options
    could override the choice of items to include in an HTML form (see
    Usage Notes 5 and 6).

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: UFDL format (not compressed)


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 134]


    2)  You can include this option as a form global option and in the
    definitions of items that trigger form submissions. These items
    have a type option setting of submit or done.

    3)  HTML Format by Item Type
        The general syntax of a submitted HTML form is:

        <item reference>=<value>&< item reference>=<value>&...
        Note: the ampersand separates form items.
 
        The syntax of an HTML form entry by item type:

    Item Type                        HTML Format
    check                  <item tag>=<value option setting>
    field                  <item tag>=<value option setting>
    list                             <item tag>=
                         <value option setting of selected cell>
                          Note: <item reference> identifies the list.
    popup                            <item tag>=
                         <value option setting of selected cell>
                          Note: <item reference> identifies the popup.
    radio                       <group option setting>=
                             <item tag of selected radio>
    <custom>              <item tag>=<value option setting>
    all other items       <item tag>=<value option setting>

    Note: combo boxes are not supported in HTML.

    Substitutions and Omissions: 

    -  Spaces in the value are replaced by the plus sign (+).
    'Two words' becomes 'Two+words'
    -  The membership operator in item and group references is replaced
       by a minus sign.
    'page_one.age_group' becomes 'page_one-age_group'
    -  Page tags are removed from item and group references in single
       page forms.
    -  Check boxes and radio buttons with a value option setting of off
       are omitted.
    -  Entries resulting in an empty string on the right hand side of
       the assignment statement are omitted. This occurs when the
       referenced option setting is empty or the option definition is
       missing.

    4)  Partial Submissions

        Just as you can specify partial submissions when transmitting
        data in UFDL format, you can also specify partial submissions
        when transmitting data in HTML format. Use the transmit and
        transmititems options. 

        Use the transmitoptions option for HTML formatted submissions
        with caution. If you omit the options used for HTML format,
        then items requiring those options are omitted also.


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 135]


        For example, if the trigger item's definition included the
        following pair of statements, the form submission would contain
        only radio item entries (all other entries use a value option
        setting).

        transmitformat = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
        transmitoptions = ["omit", "value"];

    5)  HTML Considerations

        The functionality of UFDL forms differs somewhat from HTML
        forms. Those differences are:

        -  Enclosures
           HTML does not support enclosures. To submit enclosed form
           data, use the UFDL format.

        -  Item tags
           UFDL allows a smaller set of characters in item tags than
           HTML does. UFDL item tags support the following characters:
           a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the underscore ( _ ).

        -  Check boxes
           UFDL check boxes vary slightly from HTML check boxes. UFDL
           check boxes are independent items; HTML check boxes are 
           grouped together using the same format as radio items. When
           a UFDL form is submitted in HTML format, the submission will
           contain an entry for each check box.

   5.44 transmitgroups

    This is one of the transmit-family of options that allow you to
    filter form submissions. This option lists which groups of items
    should be kept or omitted from a transmission.

    For example, if transmitgroups specifies that the group called
    countries should be kept in the transmission, then all items with
    a group setting of countries will be transmitted (unless other
    filters of greater precedence exclude them).

    This filter applies only to items for which it is valid to have a
    group option (cell, combobox, list, popup, radio).

    For details on the order of precedence of filters, see 2.5 h "Order
    of Precedence of Filters".

    Syntax

    transmitgroups = [<transmit flag>, <group identifier1>, ... <group
    identifiern>];

    Note: There may be zero or more <group identifier> entries.

    Expression           Setting     Description
    <transmit flag>      "keep"      keep items with a group setting

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 136]

                                     a group setting not included in
                                     the list
                         "omit"      omit items with a group setting
                                     specified in the <group
                                     identifier> list; keep those with
                                     a group setting not in the list
    <group identifier>   string      the name of a group setting

    Available In

    -  action
    -  button
    -  cell

    Examples

    This sample specifies that only the items in the countries and
    departments groups should be kept in the transmission. 

    transmitgroups = ["keep", "countries", "departments"];

    This sample specifies that all groups should be kept in the
    transmission except the fillType group.

    transmitgroups = ["omit", "fillType"];

    Usage Notes

    1)  The default is to keep all groups in the form.

    2)  This option is handy for keeping the user's selection in lists
    and popups. Since the value setting of a popup or list is not the
    value of the cell the user chose, but is rather the item tag of the
    cell containing the value, you might want to make sure you keep the
    selected cell in the transmission so that you can dynamic option
    reference its value. To do this, you would keep the group of cells
    associated with the popup's group.

    For details on the order of precedence of filters, see 2.5h "Order
    of Precedence of Filters".

   5.45 transmititemrefs

    This is one of the transmit-family of options that allow you to
    filter form submissions. This option lists which specific items
    should be kept or omitted from a transmission. It differs from
    transmititems in that transmititems specifies particular types of
    items to filter, whereas transmititemrefs refers to one or more
    specific items.
    For example, if transmititemrefs specifies that the item
    page1.MgrSignButton should be kept in the transmission, then even
    if a transmititems filter says all buttons should be omitted from

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 137]


    the form, the particular button on page 1 named MgrSignButton would
    be kept.

    For details on the order of precedence of filters, see 2.5h "Order
    of Precedence of Filters".

    Syntax

    transmititemrefs = [<transmit flag>, <item identifier1>, ... <item
    identifiern>];

    Note: There may be zero or more <item identifier> entries.

    Expression           Setting    Description

    Examples

    This sample specifies that only the item on page 1 called
    MgrSignButton should be transmitted, and that all other items
    should be omitted.
    
    transmititemrefs = ["keep", "page1.MgrSignButton"];

    This sample shows how you would use transmititemrefs in conjunction
    with transmititems: although all items that are buttons are
    omitted, the button on page 1 called MgrSignButton will be kept.

    transmititems = ["omit", "button"];
    transmititemrefs = ["keep", "page1.MgrSignButton"];

    Usage Notes

    2)  The default is to keep all items in the form.

    3)  The setting of a transmititemrefs always overrides a
    transmititems setting.

    4)  The setting of a transmitoptionrefs always overrides a
    transmititemrefs setting.

    Usage Notes

    1)  Default: link
------

   5.51 url

    The url option identifies an object to access. Items containing
    this option must have a type option setting of link, replace,
    submit, done, or pagedone.
 
    The object identified can be any of the following:

    -  File - used with a type option setting of link or replace
       The file identified is downloaded, and either displayed or
       saved. Examples of such files are images, word processing
       documents, and UFDL forms.

    -  Application - used with a type option setting of submit or done
       The application identified is initiated. A form processing
       application is an example of such an application.

    -  Item - used with a type option setting of pagedone
       The item identified, on the page identified, receives focus. The
       item must be on another page. 

    -  Form or Page Characteristics - used with a type option setting
       of pagedone
       The focus moves to the item defined to receive focus when the
       form or page appears. The form characteristics reference is
       global.global. The page characteristics reference is <page
       tag>.global for another page.

    Syntax

    url = [<the URL1>, <the URL2>, ... <the URLn>];

    where <the URL> is one of:
    -  a URL with the format <scheme://host.domain[:port]/path/
       filename> for files and applications
    -  #<item reference> for the next item in the form to receive focus

    Notes: 
    i)  <the URL> can occur 1-n times.
    ii) <item reference> can be a form or page characteristics
        reference.

    url = ["#page_2.expense_field"];

    Usage Notes 

    1)  Default: none

    2)  When a form communicates with a server, the information sent
    may be URL-encoded. This means all non alpha-numeric characters are
    replaced by a character triplet consisting of the % character
    followed by two hexadecimal digits that form the hexadecimal value
    of the original character. The hexadecimal digits are
    "0123456789ABCDEF". For example,
    Character    ASCII Number    URL-encoded triplet
    <space>          32                  %20
    \r               13                  %0D

    Applications receiving form data must check the content type of
    the incoming data to see whether it is url-encoded.
------

   5.52 value

    The value option reflects the contents of an item. Visually, this
    can take several forms, depending on the item to which it applies.
    For example, the value option in label items contains the label
    text; the value option in radio items contains the status
    indicator; and the value option in list items contains the identity
    of the most recently selected cell (if it was a select cell).

    An item's contents will be stored in the form whenever a user saves
    the form or submits it for processing. This is true even for
    inactive items and items using the default value option setting
    (in this case, a value option containing the default setting is
    added to the item's definition).

    Syntax

    value = <setting>;

    Expression    Setting      Description
    <setting>     string       the item's contents

    Available In


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 145]


    -  button
    -  cell
    -  check
    -  field
    -  help
    -  label
    -  list
    -  popup
    -  radio
    -  tablet

    Example

    This sample identifies the text of a label item. 

    value = "My Form Title";

    Usage Notes

    1)Default: varies by item. See the documentation for each item.

    2)Multiple line values require line breaks imbedded in the value
    text. Use the escape sequence '\n' to indicate a line break. For
    example:

    value = "This value spans\ntwo lines.";
------

   5.53 version

    The version option specifies the Universal Forms Description
    Language version used to code the form definition.

    Note: This option must be the first statement in the form. It is
    invalid in any other location. 

    Syntax

    version = <version>;

    Expression    Setting     Description
    <version>     string      the UFDL version number. 

    Note: The version number must be coded as a quoted string. Other
    expression formats are invalid in this statement.

    Available In
    -  form global characteristics (mandatory)

    Example

    This sample indicates the language in this form definition conforms
    to the UFDL version 3.2.0 specification. 

     version = "3.2.0";

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 146]



    Usage Notes

    1)  Important: Do not increase the version number of old forms
    unless they have been modified to conform to the new version.

    2)  The format of a version number is m.n.r where:
        i)   m is the major version number
        ii)  n is the minor version number
        iii) r is the maintenance release number
------

   5.54 <custom option>

    Custom options allow form designers to add application specific
    information to the form definition. This is useful when submitting
    forms to applications requiring non-UFDL information. An example of
    non-UFDL information might be an SQL query statement.

    Syntax

    <custom> = [<expression1>, ... <expressionn>];

    Note: <expression> can occur 1-n times.

    Expression     Setting    Description
    <expression>   string     an expression that assigns a value to the
                              option

    Example

    This sample shows a custom option containing an SQL query.

    sql_query = ["SELECT NAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ID = "];

    This statement could be included in the definition of an item that
    triggers a form submission. The form processing application might
    then complete the statement with a value option setting from
    another item, and use the statement results to populate a response
    form. 

    Usage Notes

    1)  The naming conventions for a custom option are as follows:
        -  It must begin with an alphabetic character.
        -  It can contain any of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, $ and
           underscore.
        -  It must contain an underscore.
------

6.0 UFDL Form Viewer Directive

    The UFDL contains the following viewer directive statement:
    -  the #include statement for including external files
    -  the #optinclude statement for optionally including external
       files

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 147]



    The syntax of a viewer directive statement is as follows:

    #<directive> "<value>"

    Do not terminate viewer directive statements with a semicolon.

    See the section "UFDL Form Options" on page 99 for syntax notation
    conventions.
------

   6.1  #include

    The #include statement allows you to include external files in your
    form definition much as you would include header files in a C
    language source file. The form viewer application replaces the
    #include statement with the contents of the include file before the
    form appears.

    Syntax

    #include "<filename>"

    Value        Setting     Description
    <filename>   string      name of the include file

    Example
    This is an example of using an include file to add image data to a
    form.

    Here is the original form definition:
?
// Create a label to display the image. 
LOGO_IMAGE = new label
{
   image = "LOGO_DATA";
}
//
// Now include the image in the form.
#include "logo.frm"
?

    This is the external file:

LOGO_DATA = new data
{
 mimedata = "<image data>";
}
The form after resolution of the include:
?
// Create a label to display the image.
LOGO_IMAGE = new label
{
   image = "LOGO_DATA";
}

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 148]


//
// Now include the image in the form.

LOGO_DATA = new data
{
 mimedata = "<image data>";
}
   
    Usage Notes

    1)  You can code a #include statement anywhere in a form definition
    except imbedded in another statement. You can also nest #include
    statements.

    2)  The include file must reside in a secure include directory
    accessible to the form viewer application.

    3)  Use include files to reduce form file size, and ensure
    standardization of form definitions. Smaller files occupy less
    space on the server and download more quickly
------

   6.2  #optinclude		

    The #optinclude statement is a variation on the #include statement.
    It allows you to include external files in your form definition
    much as you would include header files in a C language source
    file-without crashing your program if a file you attempt to include
    is not available. The form viewer application replaces the
    #optinclude statement with the contents of the optinclude file
    before the form appears.

    Syntax

    #optinclude "<filename>"

    Value        Setting      Description
    <filename>   string       name of the optinclude file


    Example

    This is an example of using an optinclude file to add image data to
    a form.

    Here is the original form definition:
?
// Create a label to display the image. 
LOGO_IMAGE = new label
{
   image = "LOGO_DATA";
}
//
// Now include the image in the form.
#optinclude "logo.frm"

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 149]


?

    This is the external file:

LOGO_DATA = new data
{
 mimedata = "<image data>";
}
   
    The form after resolution of the include:

?
// Create a label to display the image.
LOGO_IMAGE = new label
{
   image = "LOGO_DATA";
}
//
// Now include the image in the form.

LOGO_DATA = new data
{
 mimedata = "<image data>";
}
   
?

    Usage Notes

    Employing the same syntax as #include, #optinclude is a convenient
    alternative to #include, because:

    In a given pool of users, everyone can be sent the same form, but
    certain users can have access to all its components while others do
    not-but there is no risk of crashing for anyone.

    -  #optinclude saves server resources by making decisions on the
       client side about which files are to be included.

          it exists 

    Notes
    i)   For line items, either height or width must be set to zero.
         The thickness option specifies the thickness (in pixels) of
         the line in the dimension containing zero (0). If both
         settings are non-zero, the line size will default to one
         character wide by one pixel thick.
    ii)  This includes a scroll bar if one appears.

    iii) The cell's width comes from the cell's value option setting.

Appendix C: UFDL for C and C++ Programmers

    This document is intended to introduce programmers to the syntax
    of the UFDL. To do so, we will compare the UFDL to the C
    programming language, and point out many of the similarities in
    syntax and structure that exist between the two languages, as
    well as some of the differences.

    Be aware that this document outlines one way of modelling these
    similarities and differences, and that a number of other approaches
    could be used.

   C.1  Procedural vs. State Language


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 159]


    Unlike C, the UFDL is a state language. Where C describes a
    procedure that is followed, the UFDL describes a state that is
    maintained. All of the statements in a UFDL form are always
    maintained as being true. 

    As a result, computations are constantly updated throughout the
    form. For instance, imagine a form with a field called total, the
    value of which is based on adding the values of five other fields.
    Whenever a value is entered (or changed) in one of those five
    fields, the total field will be instantly updated to reflect that
    change. In this, the UFDL acts much like a spreadsheet.

   C.2  Globals and Functions (Pages)

    When coding a form, the first statements define the global
    characteristics and includes. These are much like global variables
    and includes in C. The next thing defined is the first page of the
    form, which parallels a function in a C program. The table below
    demonstrates these similarities:

           C                                    UFDL

    int version=3;                         version="3.2.0";
    char *bgColor="blue";                  bgcolor=["blue"];

    #include "header.h"                    #include "header.frm"

    void page_1()                          page_1=new page
    {                                      {
    <code>                                 <code>
    }                                      }

    Notice the similarities in syntax as well. Statements are ended
    with a semi-colon. New pages (or functions) do not end with a
    semi-colon, and the code for each begins and ends with braces.

    Within each page, the UFDL allows the definition of page-specific
    characteristics similar to function specific variables. You can
    also define items, which can be thought of as instances of
    predefined structures or cases. Within each instance, there are a
    number of options that can be set. The following table illustrates
    this:

           C                                    UFDL

    struct label{
     char *value;
     char *fontcolor;
     char *bgcolor;
     };

    void page_1()                          page_1=new page
    {                                      {
    struct label *label_1=NULL;            bgcolor=["papayawhip"];
    char *bgcolor = "papayawhip";

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 160]



     label_1=(struct label*)malloc         label_1=new label
               (sizeof(struct label));     {
     label_1->value=strdup("This is a          value="This is a label";
       label");
     label_1->fontcolor=strdup("white");       fontcolor=["white"];
     label_1->transmit=strdup("none");         transmit="none";     
     label_1->bgcolor=strdup(bgcolor);     }   
    }                                     }
    In this example, value and fontcolor are options for the item
    label_1. Notice that they are contained within an opening and a
    closing brace, which makes it clear, without dereferencing, which
    item they belong to (this is similar to the with statement in
    Pascal). Also note that bgcolor is a page characteristic that is
    automatically assigned to label_1.

    Additional pages can be defined just like additional functions, and
    there is no limit to the number of pages you can have, nor to the
    number of items you can have within a page. Additionally, it is
    possible to create custom items and options, allowing for greater
    flexibility.

   C.3  References and Dynamic Option Reference

    Specific items or option can be referenced through the use of a
    reference string. Additionally, the values of options can be
    dynamic option reference in a manner similar to C.

           C                                    UFDL

    Structure Declaration                  Item Declaration
        struct label{                      label_1=new label
	    struct label *value;               {
	    char *fontcolor;                      value="label_2";
	    };                                    fontcolor=["white"];
                                           }
    struct label *label_1;                 label_2=new label
    struct label *label_2;                 {
                                              fontcolor=["blue"];
    label_1->value=label_2;                }
    label_1->fontcolor=strdup("white");
    label_2->fontcolor=strdup("blue");

    References                             References
    label_1->fontcolor is white            label_1.fontcolor is white
    label_1->value->fontcolor is blue      label_1.value->fontcolor is
                                             blue

    no equivalent                          page1.label_1.fontcolor is
                                             white

    Note that the inclusion of page1 is optional. Including it allows
    the item or option to be referenced from a different page. Where C
    requires you to pass values between functions by using parameters,
    the UFDL allows you to access any value from any page on the form

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 161]


    by using a direct reference.

   C.4  Arrays

    Many of the options in the UFDL are set using array structures.
    Specific elements in these arrays are referenced just as they
    would be in C.

           C                                    UFDL
    Array Declaration                      Option Declaration
    char *format[2][2];                    format=["integer",
                                             range=["1","10"]];

    format[0][0]=strdup("integer");
    format[0][1]=NULL;
    format[1][0]=strdup("1");
    format[1][1]=strdup("10");

    Element Reference                      Element Reference
    format[1][0]                           format[1][0]  or
                                           format[range][0]


    Note the second Element Reference in the UFDL. This reference is
    based on assigning a name to an element or set of elements within
    the array. In this case, the name range was given to the second set
    of elements. This allows you to access the elements of an array
    without having to know the order of those elements.

    There is no limit to the depth allowed an array in the UFDL-you can
    have infinitely nested arrays. Additionally, the UFDL does not
    create unnecessary blocks in memory. For instance, in the above
    example format[0][1] was assigned to be NULL in the C code. This is
    because this portion of the array is not used. In the UFDL, that
    portion of the array is never created. This means that the UFDL
    uses significantly less memory to store multi-dimensional arrays. 

   C.5  Assignment

    The UFDL has a single data type: the string. All values, be they
    integer, character, or float, are stored as literal strings. In
    order to assign literal strings, quotes are used just as in C. For
    example:

           C                                    UFDL

    value=strdup("This is a literal        value="This is a literal
      string");                              string";

    size[0]=strdup("10");                  size=["10","10"];
    size[1]=strdup("10");

    Note that you do not need to use any of the string functions such
    as strdup. Memory management is handled automatically. Assigning a
    string to an option automatically copies the string and disposes of

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 162]


    any previous value for that option. Additionally, the full list of
    elements can be assigned to an array at any time in the UFDL code.
    In C, this is only possible when you first declare your arrays (see
    the size example above).

Appendix D:  Glossary

Absolute Positioning

    Absolute positioning places items in set locations on the form. This
    form of positioning uses an x-y coordinate system to specify where,
    in relation to the upper-left corner of the form, the item should be
    placed. Absolute positioning allows for drag-and-drop form designer
    functionality. See Also: Relative Positioning

Automatic Action

    Automatic actions are background actions that you can set your form
    to carry out without user prompting. These actions can be set to
    occur after a specific amount of time, or to repeat periodically.
    Use automatic actions to create effects such as periodic interfacing
    with databases. For example:

    ping_action = new action
    {
            delay = ["repeat", "120"];
            type = "submit";
            url = ["http://www.server.domain/cgi-bin/status"];
    }

Alignment Modifiers

    This is a group of modifiers used in relative positioning. They are
    used to set locators that align items in relation to each other. See
    Also: Relative Positioning, Locators

Bounding Box

    An unseen rectangular area surrounding each item and including all
    elements of the item (including built-in labels and borders). Used
    in the relative ositioning scheme for determiniing the "edge" of an
    item.

Build Order

    When you create items on a form, the order in which they are created
    forms a sequence. The first item you create is the first item in the
    sequence, the second item is second in the sequence, and so on. This
    sequence is called the build order. The build order can affect
    relative positioning.

Compression

    You can set up forms to submit and save as compressed files. See the
    descriptions or the saveformat and transmitformat options.

Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 163]



Computation

    See: Formulas

Custom Item

    Custom items are items that are not part of the standard UFDL. You
    define these items yourself. Custom items are ignored by the a UFDL
    parser, and are never visible on the form. Use custom items to
    integrate the form with other applications. See Also: Custom
    Options, Hidden Items

Custom Option

    Custom options are options that are not part of the standard UFDL.
    You create these options yourself.  Custom options are ignored by a
    UFDL parser, and ever affect the appearance of an item. Use custom
    options to integrate your form with other applications. See Also:
    Custom Items

Expansion Modifiers

    This is a group of modifiers used in relative sizing. They are used
    to set locators that adjust the size of items in relation to other
    items on the form. See Also: Extent Modifier, Locators

Extent Modifier
    This modifier is used in both normal and relative positioning.  It
    is used to set locators that set the size of items in pixels. See
    Also: Expand Modifiers, Locators

Filtering

    You can set up forms to filter out specific item types, option
    types, or items when they are transmitted. This can be useful for
    eliminating unnecessary information when the form is being
    transmitted to another application. See the descriptions for the
    transmit, transmititems, and ransmitoptions options. See Also:
    Compression

Formulas

    Formulas allow you to add math or logic to your form. You can use
    them to add values or make decisions based on user input. Also
    referred to as computations or logical operations.

Global Settings

    Global settings are used to set options for the whole form. Each
    item in the form will reflect that option setting, unless the same
    option is also set for that page or item.

Hidden Items


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 164]


    Hidden items are not independently visible on the form. However, in
    some cases they may contribute to the appearance of other form
    items. The hidden items are: data items, cells, action items, help
    items, and custom items.

Identifiers

    Identifiers are used to uniquely identify a page, item, option, or
    option element in the form. For a discussion of the character set
    you may use when creating identifiers, see the section called
    Identifiers in '2. The Universal Forms Description Language'.

Include

    The #include statement allows you to "include" external files in a
    form. These files must be in a UFDL format that is compatible with
    the form. A UFDL parser must insert include files into forms at the
    place marked by an #include statement.

Input Focus

    When a user views a form, the input focus is the focus that moves
    from item to item in the form when the user presses the TAB key.

Item Tag

    Each item has a unique item tag, or name, which is used to identify
    that item.

Locators

    Locators are used to set both the locations of an item on the page
    and any relative or extent sizing that should apply to the item.

Modifier

    Modifiers are combined with item tags to create locators. Modifiers
    describe how an item should be positioned in relation to its
    reference items. For example, after, below, left-to-left, and so on.
    See Also: Locators, Reference Items

Page

    Each form can be composed of any number of pages, just like a paper
    form. Each page is identified with a page tag, begins with an open
    brace ({) and ends with a close brace (}). All forms must have at
    least one page.

Page Settings

    These settings set global option settings for all items on the page
    (unless an individual item description overrides the setting). Page
    settings override global settings, but are overridden by options set
    for individual items.


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 165]


Page Tag

    Each page has a unique page tag, or name, which is used to identify
    that page.

Reference

    References allow you to identify a specific option by providing a
    "path" to it. This means that you can refer directly to a specific
    option anywhere in the form. A reference is constructed by combining
    the page tag, item tag, and option name that will point to the
    option you want. For example, page1.title_label.value points to the
    value option of the title_label on page one.

Reference Items

    When using relative positioning or sizing, you will need to use some
    items as reference points. These reference points will be used as
    anchors that set either where an item is positioned on the form or
    how large the item is. If the reference items are moved or change
    size, the item using them as anchors may also move or change size.
    See Also: Relative Positioning, Relative Sizing

Relative Positioning

    Relative positioning places items on the form in relation to other
    items. This means that items will move on the form if their
    reference item moves. Relative positioning is useful for ensuring
    cross-platform compatability. See Also: Absolute Positioning,
    Reference Items

Relative Sizing

    Relative sizing adjusts the size of items on the form in relation to
    other items. This means that items will change size on the form if
    their reference item moves or changes size. Relative sizing is
    useful for ensuring that the edges of your items line up on the
    form. See Also: Reference Items

Required Status

    The required status is part of the format option. It determines
    whether the user of a form is required to enter information into an
    item.  The required status can be set to "optional" or "mandatory".

Start Value

    The start value is an element of the option name that contains the
    literal resolution of an option reference or other formula. The
    start value element is represented as an open angle bracket, the
    value in quotation marks, and a close angle bracket on the left-hand
    side of the equal sign, like this:

        value<"Jane E. Smith"> = page1.nameField.value;


Universal Forms Description Language                          [page 166]


    The viewer sets this literal value when a form is signed, submitted,
    or saved (and discards any old value if necessary). Because a
digitally
    signed formula never fires after being signed, the start value for
the
    option is always the same--and therefore it is possible to reference
the
    option and get the signed literal value.


Tab Order

    This is the order in which the user will move through the item on
    the form by pressing the TAB key.  The tab order only includes those
    items that take user input, such as fields, buttons, and so on.  You
    can set the tab order yourself.

Version Number

    This option records the version number of the UFDL that was used to
    create the form. It is only available in the global settings.
