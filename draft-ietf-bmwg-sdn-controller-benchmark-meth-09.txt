          Benchmarking Methodology for SDN Controller Performance
             draft-ietf-bmwg-sdn-controller-benchmark-meth-09


Abstract

   This document defines methodologies for benchmarking control plane
   performance of SDN controllers. SDN controller is a core component
   in software-defined networking architecture that controls the
   network behavior. SDN controllers have been implemented with many
   varying designs in order to achieve their intended network
   functionality. Hence, the authors have taken the approach of
   considering an SDN controller as a black box, defining the
   methodology in a manner that is agnostic to protocols and network
   services supported by controllers. The intent of this document is to
   provide a method to measure the performance of all controller
   implementations.

Internet-Draft SDN Controller Benchmarking Methodology         May 2018


1. Introduction

   This document provides generic methodologies for benchmarking SDN
   controller performance. An SDN controller may support many
   northbound and southbound protocols, implement a wide range of
   applications, and work solely, or as a group to achieve the desired
   functionality. This document considers an SDN controller as a black
   box, regardless of design and implementation. The tests defined in
   the document can be used to benchmark SDN controller for
   performance, scalability, reliability and security independent of
   northbound and southbound protocols. Terminology related to
   benchmarking SDN controllers is described in the companion
   terminology document [I-D.sdn-controller-benchmark-term]. These
   tests can be performed on an SDN controller running as a virtual
   machine (VM) instance or on a bare metal server. This document is
   intended for those who want to measure the SDN controller
   performance as well as compare various SDN controllers performance.

   Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2. Scope

   This document defines methodology to measure the networking metrics
   of SDN controllers. For the purpose of this memo, the SDN controller
   is a function that manages and controls Network Devices. Any SDN
   controller without a control capability is out of scope for this
   memo. The tests defined in this document enable benchmarking of SDN
   Controllers in two ways; as a standalone controller and as a cluster
   of homogeneous controllers. These tests are recommended for
   execution in lab environments rather than in live network
   deployments. Performance benchmarking of a federation of
   controllers, set of SDN controllers managing different domains, is
   beyond the scope of this document.

3. Test Setup

   The tests defined in this document enable measurement of an SDN
   controller's performance in standalone mode and cluster mode. This
   section defines common reference topologies that are later referred
   to in individual tests.

Internet-Draft SDN Controller Benchmarking Methodology         May 2018


4. Test Considerations

4.1. Network Topology

   The test cases SHOULD use Leaf-Spine topology with at least 2
   Network Devices in the topology for benchmarking. The test traffic
   generators TP1 and TP2 SHOULD be connected to the leaf Network
   Device 1 and the leaf Network Device n. To achieve a complete
   performance characterization of the SDN controller, it is
   recommended that the controller be benchmarked for many network
   topologies and a varying number of Network Devices. Further, care
   should be taken to make sure that a loop prevention mechanism is
   enabled either in the SDN controller, or in the network when the
   topology contains redundant network paths.

4.2. Test Traffic

   Test traffic is used to notify the controller about the asynchronous
   arrival of new flows. The test cases SHOULD use frame sizes of 128,
   512 and 1508 bytes for benchmarking. Tests using jumbo frames are
   optional.

4.3. Test Emulator Requirements

   The Test Emulator SHOULD time stamp the transmitted and received
   control messages to/from the controller on the established network
   connections. The test cases use these values to compute the
   controller processing time.

4.4. Connection Setup

   There may be controller implementations that support unencrypted and
   encrypted network connections with Network Devices. Further, the
   controller may have backward compatibility with Network Devices
   running older versions of southbound protocols. It may be useful to
   measure the controller performance with one or more applicable
   connection setup methods defined below. For cases with encrypted
   communications between the controller and the switch, key management
   and key exchange MUST take place before any performance or benchmark
   measurements.

     1. Unencrypted connection with Network Devices, running same
        protocol version.

          b. Controller running older protocol version and switch
             running current protocol version

4.5. Measurement Point Specification and Recommendation

   The measurement accuracy depends on several factors including the
   point of observation where the indications are captured. For
   example, the notification can be observed at the controller or test
   emulator. The test operator SHOULD make the observations/
   measurements at the interfaces of test emulator unless it is
   explicitly mentioned otherwise in the individual test. In any case,
   the locations of measurement points MUST be reported.

4.6. Connectivity Recommendation

   The SDN controller in the test setup SHOULD be connected directly
   with the forwarding and the management plane test emulators to avoid
   any delays or failure introduced by the intermediate devices during
   benchmarking tests. When the controller is implemented as a virtual
   machine, details of the physical and logical connectivity MUST be
   reported.

4.7. Test Repeatability

   To increase the confidence in measured result, it is recommended
   that each test RECOMMENDED be repeated a minimum of 10 times.

4.8. Test Reporting

   Each test has a reporting format that contains some global and
   identical reporting components, and some individual components that
   are specific to individual tests. The following test configuration
   parameters and controller settings parameters MUST be reflected in
   the test report.

   2. Tester should be able to retrieve the discovered topology
     information either through the controller's management interface,
     or northbound interface to determine if the discovery was
     successful and complete.
   3. Ensure that the controller's topology re-discovery timeout has
     been set to the maximum value to avoid initiation of re-discovery
     process in the middle of the test.

Procedure:

   1. Ensure that the controller is operational, its network
     applications, northbound and southbound interfaces are up and
     running.
   2. Establish the network connections between controller and Network
     Devices.
   3. Record the time for the first discovery message (Tm1) received
     from the controller at forwarding plane test emulator interface
     I1.
   4. Query the controller every t seconds (RECOMMENDED value for t is
     3) to obtain the discovered network topology information through
     the northbound interface or the management interface and compare
     it with the deployed network topology information.
   5. Stop the trial when the discovered topology information matches
     the deployed network topology, or when the discovered topology
     information return the same details for 3 consecutive queries.
   6. Record the time last discovery message (Tmn) sent to controller
     from the forwarding plane test emulator interface (I1) when the
     trial completed successfully. (e.g., the topology matches).

   the controller(s) performed processing and replied with a valid and
   productive (non-trivial) response message

   This test will measure two benchmarks on Asynchronous Message
   Processing Rate using a single procedure. The two benchmarks are
   (see section 2.3.1.3 of [I-D.sdn-controller-benchmark-term]):

   1. Loss-free Asynchronous Message Processing Rate

   2. Maximum Asynchronous Message Processing Rate

   Here two benchmarks are determined through a series of trials where
   the number of messages are sent to the controller(s), and the
   responses from the controller(s) are counted over the trial
   duration. The message response rate and the message loss ratio are
   calculated for each trial.

   The test SHOULD use one of the test setups described in section 3.1
   or section 3.2 of this document.

Prerequisite:

     topology discovery for the connected Network Devices.
   2. Choose and record the Trial Duration (Td), the sending rate step-
     size (STEP), the tolerance on equality for two consecutive trials
     (P%),and the maximum possible message sending rate (Ntx1/Td).

Procedure:

   1. Generate asynchronous messages continuously at the maximum
     possible rate on the established connections from all the
     emulated/simulated Network Devices for the given trial Duration
     (Td).
   2. Record the total number of responses received from the controller
     (Nrx1) as well as the number of messages sent (Ntx1) to the
     controller within the trial duration (Td).
   3. Calculate the Asynchronous Message Processing Rate (Tr1) and the
     Message Loss Ratio (Lr1). Ensure that the controller(s) have
     returned to normal operation.
   4. Repeat the trial by reducing the asynchronous message sending rate
     used in last trial by the STEP size.
   5. Continue repeating the trials and reducing the sending rate until
     both the maximum value of Nrxn (number of responses received from

     been found.
   6. The trials corresponding to the benchmark levels MUST be repeated
     using the same asynchronous message rates until the responses
     received from the controller are equal (+/-P%) for two consecutive
     trials.
   7. Record the number of responses received from the controller (Nrxn)
     as well as the number of messages sent (Ntxn) to the controller in
     the last trial.

   Loss-free Asynchronous Message Processing Rate = MAX(Trn) given
   Lrn=0

Reporting Format:

   The Asynchronous Message Processing Rate results MUST be reported in
   the format of a table with a row for each trial.

   The table should report the following information in addition to the
   configuration parameters captured in section 4.8, with columns:

   - Offered rate (Ntxn/Td)

   - Asynchronous Message Processing Rate (Trn)

   - Loss Ratio (Lr)

   - Benchmark at this iteration (blank for none, Maximum, Loss-Free)

   The results MAY be presented in the form of a graph. The X axis
   SHOULD be the Offered rate, and dual Y axes would represent
   Asynchronous Message Processing Rate and Loss Ratio, respectively.

8. Security Considerations

   Benchmarking tests described in this document are limited to the
   performance characterization of controllers in a lab environment
   with isolated network.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the controller.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the controller specifically
   for benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security
   arising from the controller SHOULD be identical in the lab and in
   production networks.

Appendix A  Benchmarking Methodology using OpenFlow Controllers

   This section gives an overview of OpenFlow protocol and provides
   test methodology to benchmark SDN controllers supporting OpenFlow
   southbound protocol. OpenFlow protocol is used as an example to
   illustrate the methodologies defined in this document.

A.1. Protocol Overview

   OpenFlow is an open standard protocol defined by Open Networking
   Foundation (ONF)[ OpenFlow Switch Specification], used for
   programming the forwarding plane of network switches or routers via
   a centralized controller.

A.2. Messages Overview

   OpenFlow protocol supports three messages types namely controller-
   to-switch, asynchronous and symmetric.

   Controller-to-switch messages are initiated by the controller and
   used to directly manage or inspect the state of the switch. These
   messages allow controllers to query/configure the switch (Features,
   Configuration messages), collect information from switch (Read-State
   message), send packets on specified port of switch (Packet-out
   message), and modify switch forwarding plane and state (Modify-
   State, Role-Request messages etc.).

   Asynchronous messages are generated by the switch without a
   controller soliciting them. These messages allow switches to update
   controllers to denote an arrival of new flow (Packet-in), switch
   state change (Flow-Removed, Port-status) and error (Error).

   Symmetric messages are generated in either direction without
   solicitation. These messages allow switches and controllers to set
   up connection (Hello), verify for liveness (Echo) and offer
   additional functionalities (Experimenter).

A.3. Connection Overview

   OpenFlow channel is used to exchange OpenFlow message between an
   OpenFlow switch and an OpenFlow controller. The OpenFlow channel
   connection can be setup using plain TCP or TLS. By default, a switch
   establishes single connection with SDN controller. A switch may
   establish multiple parallel connections to single controller
   (auxiliary connection) or multiple controllers to handle controller
   failures and load balancing.

Internet-Draft SDN Controller Benchmarking Methodology         May 2018


Legend:

         NB: Northbound
         SB: Southbound
         OF: OpenFlow
         Tm1: Time of reception of first LLDP message from controller
         Tmn: Time of last LLDP message sent to controller


Discussion:

   The Network Topology Discovery Time can be obtained by calculating
   the time difference between the first PACKET_OUT with LLDP message
   received from the controller (Tm1) and the last PACKET_IN with LLDP
   message sent to the controller (Tmn) when the comparison is
   successful.

   Note: The Ntx1 on initial trials should be greater than Nrx1 and
   repeat the trials until the Nrxn for two consecutive trials equeal
   to (+/-P%).

Discussion:

   This test will measure two benchmarks using single procedure. 1) The
   Maximum Asynchronous Message Processing Rate will be obtained by
   calculating the maximum PACKET OUTs (Nrxn) received from the
   controller(s) across n trials. 2) The Loss-free Asynchronous Message
   Processing Rate will be obtained by calculating the maximum PACKET
   OUTs received from controller (s) when Loss Ratio equals zero. The
   loss ratio is obtained by 1 - Nrxn/Ntxn

Discussion:

   The Network Topology Change Detection Time can be obtained by
   finding the difference between the time the OpenFlow switch S1 sends
   the PORT_STATUS message (T0) and the time that the OpenFlow
   controller sends the first topology re-discovery message (T1) to
   OpenFlow switches.

Discussion:

   The value of N1 provides the Network Discovery Size value. The trial
   duration can be set to the stipulated time within which the user
   expects the controller to complete the discovery process.

   Discussion:

   Query the controller forwarding table entries for multiple times
   until the three consecutive queries return the same value. The last
   value retrieved from the controller will provide the Forwarding
   Table Capacity value. The query interval is user configurable. The 5
   seconds shown in this example is for representational purpose.

         Rn2: Total number of frames received at Test Port 2 with
              2% incorrect frames

Discussion:

   The traffic rate sent towards OpenFlow switch from Test Port 1
   should be 1% higher than the Path Programming Rate. Rn1 will provide
   the Path Provisioning Rate of controller at 1% of incorrect frames
   handling and Rn2 will provide the Path Provisioning Rate of
   controller at 2% of incorrect frames handling.

   The procedure defined above provides test steps to determine the
   effect of handling error packets on Path Programming Rate. Same
   procedure can be adopted to determine the effects on other
   performance tests listed in this benchmarking tests.

Discussion:

   TCP SYN attack should be launched from one of the emulated/simulated
   OpenFlow Switch. Rn1 provides the Path Programming Rate of
   controller uponhandling denial of service attack.

   The procedure defined above provides test steps to determine the
   effect of handling denial of service on Path Programming Rate. Same
   procedure can be adopted to determine the effects on other
   performance tests listed in this benchmarking tests.

Discussion:

   The time difference between the last valid frame received before the
   traffic loss and the first frame received after the traffic loss
   will provide the controller failover time.

   If there is no frame loss during controller failover time, the
   controller failover time can be deemed negligible.

Legend:

         G-ARP: Gratuitous ARP message.
         Seq.no: Sequence number.
         Sa: Neighbor switch of the switch that was brought down.

   Discussion:

   The time difference between the last valid frame received before the
   traffic loss (Packet number with sequence number x) and the first
   frame received after the traffic loss (packet with sequence number
   n) will provide the network path re-provisioning time.

   Note that the trial is valid only when the controller provisions the
   alternate path upon network failure.
