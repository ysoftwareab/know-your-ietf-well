1.    Introduction 
    
   LCONVERT is based on IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501]. It defines additional 
   enhancements for optimization in a mobile setting: extensions to the 
   IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] that allows adaptation and transcoding 
   of attachments as needed by the client. Conversion (adaptation, 
   transcoding) may be requested by the client and performed by the 
   server on a best effort basis or decided by the server based on its 
   knowledge of the client capabilities, user or administrator 
   preferences or its settings.  
    
   These are important features required in particular to support mobile 
   email use cases [MEMAIL], [OMA-ME-RD]. 
    
   A server that supports LCONVERT can convert attachments to other 
   formats to be viewed on a mobile device. The client can explicitly 
   request a particular conversion. The server complies on a best effort 
   basis. When not possible, the server determines based on its own 
   strategy (e.g. based on knowledge of the client as discussed 
   hereafter) how to convert. If the server knows the characteristics of 
   the device or can determine them (out of scope of LCONVERT), the 
   attachments can also be optimized for the capabilities of the devices 
   (e.g. form factor of pictures). See discussion in Appendix B. This is 
   a recommended server behavior. 
      
2.   Relation with other E-mail specifications 
    
   The Lemonade Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] specifies the Lemonade Pull 
   Model that governs the exchanges among mail servers or between 
   desktop mail client and mail servers. Lemonade investigates adding 
   mobile optimizations for the next version of the profile. 
    
   LCONVERT should be seen as a way to address the issues of mobile 
   optimization and an input to the Lemonade Profile work. It addresses 
   the topic of attachment conversions identified by the Lemonade work 
   as critical for mobile email.

   LCONVERT does not address conversion and streaming of media as also 
   identified of interest by lemonade. This has not been identified as 
   relevant to mobile e-mail [MEMAIL] and [OMA-ME-RD]. 
    
   Clients and servers MAY support other Lemonade extensions and 
   behaviors. 
    
   This document assumes that clients MUST be compliant to LCONVERT when 
   it decides to use this command. The server that claims support of 
   LCONVERT MUST be compliant to LCONVERT for its exchanges with the 
   mobile client.  
    
3.   Interactions between the Client and Server when supporting LCONVERT 
    
   A compliant server must support all IMAPv4Rev1 commands from client 
   devices following the syntax defined in [RFC3501].  Thus, a client 
   may issue any existing IMAP commands to the server, and both the 
   server and client must behave as specified in [RFC3501].   
 
4.   The CAPABILITY Command 
    
   The CAPABILITY command is defined in RFC3501, section 6.1.1.  The 
   client sends a CAPABILITY command so it can query the server to find 
   out what commands it supports.  In RFC3501, the IMAP server is 
   allowed to specify additional capabilities not included in that 
   specification.  A server that supports LCONVERT and its requirements 
   MUST list that it supports LCONVERT.   
 
   A server can also enumerate individually the other commands that it 
   supports.  
    
   capability_cmd =  tag SP "CAPABILITY"  
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY 
   Result:  OK - capability completed 
      BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 
    
   Example: A server that implements LDELIVER.  
      C: a001 CAPABILITY 
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=LOGIN IDLE LCONVERT 
      S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed 
 
5.   LCONVERT & UID LCONVERT 
    
   LCONVERT and UID LCONVERT are used for attachments conversion.  The 
   client sends one message sequence number or UID, the body part to 
   retrieve, and gives the mime-type and subtype to convert the 
   attachment to.  When specifying the body part, the client can specify

   to peek only at the message and/or to return only certain bytes of 
   the converted part.  Optionally, after the mime-type and subtype, the 
   client can specify additional parameters specific to the target 
   content type, such as CHARSET if the target content-type is 
   TEXT/plain and optionally content-transfer-encoding. See Appendix B 
   for a description of LCONVERT parameters. 
    
   The server is not required to respect those parameters.  Indeed, the 
   server may know a priori information about the client obtained 
   through a different mechanism outside the scope of LCONVERT (e.g. 
   dynamically through device description mechanisms or when the device 
   was associated to the account). These preferences may be used to 
   predefine what conversions are possible. Ideally the client should 
   request the same conversions. In addition, this information may also 
   allow attachment adaptation (e.g. picture form factor) instead of 
   solely format conversion. 
    
   As a response to an LCONVERT command, the server gives an untagged 
   LCONVERT response which has syntax similar to an untagged FETCH 
   response.  The LCONVERT response includes a BODY[] data item, a 
   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE data item, and a UID data item if the command is 
   UID LCONVERT.  The BODYPARTSTRUCTURE data item is introduced by the 
   LCONVERT command.  It follows the exact syntax specified in 
   BODYSTRUCTURE, but contains information for only the converted part.  
   All information contained in BODYPARTSTRUCTURE pertains to the state 
   of the part after it is converted, such as the converted mime-type, 
   sub-type, size, or charset.  The client must respect any values in 
   this BODYPARTSTRUCTURE, meaning if it specifies a different content-
   transfer-encoding value, the client must decode the response based on 
   that encoding. It must also respect the required parameter values 
   pertaining to the specific target content-type (for example, CHARSET 
   if target content-type is TEXT/plain).

   Note:  as DEFAULT/DEFAULT MAY be used to request conversion as 
   decided as default by the server (in general for the media type or 
   based on knowledge of the target device, possibly based on the user 
   preferences logged with the server) 
    
   Example:  The client fetches an attachment in the message with the 
   message sequence number of 2 in the Inbox and asks to have that 
   attachment converted to pdf format.  The client does not request a 
   content-transfer-encoding, and in this case, the server uses the same 
   content-transfer-encoding to encode the converted response. 
    
      C: a001 LCONVERT 2 BODY[3] as application/pdf 
      S: * 2 LCONVERT (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("APPLICATION" "PDF" () NIL  
         NIL "Base64" 2135 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3] {2135} 
         <the document in .pdf format> 
         ) 
      S: a001 OK LCONVERT COMPLETED 
    
   Example:  The client requests for conversion of a text/html section 
   as text/plain and asks for a charset of us-ascii and a 7bit encoding.  
   The server cannot respect the charset request because there are non-
   us-ascii characters in the html code.  Thus, in the untagged 
   response, the server returns the charset of UTF-8 and a 8bit 
   encoding, along with the converted text. 
      C: a001 LCONVERT 2 BODY[3] as text/plain;charset="us-ascii"; 
         content-transfer-encoding="7bit" 
      S: * 2 LCONVERT (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("TEXT" "PLAIN" () NIL  
         NIL "Base64" 2135 181 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3] {2135} 
           the document in text/plain format 
           ) 
      S: a001 OK LCONVERT COMPLETED 
    
   Example:  The client requests for conversion of a text/html section 
   as text/plain, but only wants 1000 bytes, starting from byte 2001.  
      C: a001 LCONVERT 2 BODY[3]<2001.1000> as text/plain;charset="us- 
         ascii";content-transfer-encoding="7bit" 
      S: * 2 LCONVERT (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("TEXT" "PLAIN" () NIL  
         NIL "Base64" 2135 181 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3]<2001> {135} 
           bytes 2001 - 2135 of the document in text/plain format 
           )

Security Considerations 
    
   When an implementation is proxy-based, this may create new security 
   issues.  These issues are discussed in detail in Appendix C, because 
   the issues are dependent on the implementation of this protocol 
   rather than inherent to the protocol itself. 
 
   On bandwidth limited mobile networks where users pay per data 
   volumes, spam may become an important issue. It can be mitigated with 
   appropriate filters and server-side spam prevention tools. These are 
   of course outside the scope of LCONVERT. 
 
   It is also recommended that clients be explicitly registered with the 
   server through separate channels / application. Exchanges should then 
   be paired.

A.   Security Issues for Proxy-Based Implementations  
    
   In some implementations, the client may connect to a proxy that sits 
   in an operator network, but the backend email storage server sits in 
   a separate enterprise network.  The enterprise network is assumed to 
   be secure, but the operator network may not be trusted.  If 
   unencrypted information lies in the operator network, that 
   information is vulnerable to attacks. 
    
   If the LCONVERT extensions are all implemented in the enterprise 
   network, then the proxy on the carrier should be an encrypted SSL 
   pass-through proxy.  The proxy is unaware of the encryption keys and 
   thus cannot encrypt any data.  Without the encryption key, this proxy 
   cannot see any of the information sent from the client, nor can it 
   send any bogus commands to the backend enterprise email server to 
   corrupt the user's mailbox.  The additional cost for this design is 
   that the backend enterprise email server and the client devices must 
   have additional processing to handle this encryption. 
    
   If the LCONVERT compliant server is implemented as a backend IMAP 
   server with additional command processing done on the proxy, there 
   are more complex security issues.  This proxy must be able to send 
   commands to the backend server to accomplish its tasks, as well as 
   read information coming from the backend server.  An attacker thus 
   can send commands to the backend to change the state of the mail 
   storage, possibly corrupting it.  In addition, it can read responses 
   from the mail server that might contain confidential email 
   information.  This proxy may also send bogus responses back to the 
   client.  Clearly, this setup is not an ideal issue and many

   complications that make this problem complex to solve.  The 
   suggestion recommended is to remedy the problem of unencrypted, 
   untagged FETCH responses that may contain confidential information.  
   Encrypted responses should be used in place of any untagged FETCH 
   responses, which contain encrypted message information to be passed 
   through the proxy on the operator network.  The key exchange for 
   encryption should not occur through the proxy.  It has to be done 
   through another channel: manually entered by user (e.g. password), or 
   via an HTTP SSL request to the enterprise server.  Any other 
   additional server responses containing sensitive information 
   (passwords, etc.) should be encrypted.   
    
B.   LCONVERT transcoding parameters 
     
   LCONVERT servers MAY support additional transcoding parameters for 
   each media type. All LCONVERT compliant servers MUST minally support 
   recognition of charset and encoding parameters for text/* mime types, 
   although they may decline to honor some requests. For media types 
   other than text, it is beyond the scope of this document to define 
   conversion parameters. In general however, LCONVERT compliant servers 
   MAY choose to support additional parameters, and if so, they SHOULD 
   follow the OMA STI 1.0 spec [OMA-STI] adopting the same parameter 
   names as defined in second 5.2.4 and above for the most popular 
   image/*, video/*, and audio/* codecs 
    
   As an example, in section 5.2.6.2 of [OMA-STI], the parameters 
   "width" and "height" are defined. The following example illustrates 
   how these OMA STI parameters MUST be used with XCONVERT. 
    
         C: a001 UID LCONVERT 100 BODY[2] as 
   image/jpg;width=128;height=96  
         S: * 2 LCONVERT (UID 100 BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[2] ("IMAGE" "JPG"   
            () NIL NIL "Base64" 4182 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[2] {4182}   
            <this part of a document is a rescaled image in JPG format 
   with width=128, height=96.>
