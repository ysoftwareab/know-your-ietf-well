Abstract

   This document describes a URN namespace that contains Object
   Identifiers (OIDs).

1. Introduction

   An Object Identifier is a series of digits delimited in some way.
   The rules roughly state that once an entity is assigned an Object
   Identifier (OID) it has sole discrection to further subdelegate off
   of that OID. Some examples of OIDs include: 

   o  1.3.6.1 - the Internet OID 
   o  1.3.6.1.4.1 - IANA-assigned company OIDs, used for private MIBs
      and such things 
   o  1.3.6.1.2.1.27 - The Applications MIB
   o  0.9.2342.19200300.100.4 - Object ID's used in the directory pilot
      project to identify X.500 Object Classes. Mostly defined in
      RFC-1274.

Internet-Draft             OID URN Namespace                  April 2000


   This document specifies the "oid" URN namespace[1]. This namespace
   is for encoding an Object Identifier as specified in ASN.1[2] as a
   URI. 

   The namespace specification is for a formal namespace. 

2. Specification Template

   Namespace ID: 

      "oid" requested.

   Registration Information: 

       Registration Version Number: 1
       Registration Date: 2000-04-30

   Declared registrant of the namespace: 

      I need help here. I'm not comfortable being the 'registrant'. So
      who do I actually put here?

   Declaration of structure: 

      The NSS portion of the identifier follows the string encoding
      rules found in X.209 which specify a series of digits seperated
      by a period with the most significant digit being at the left and
      the least significant being at the right. 

      No changes are anticipated since Object Identifiers are fairly
      simple and have been standardized with no changes for many years. 

   Relevant ancillary documentation: 

      Relevant documentation can be found in X.208[2]. 

   Identifier uniqueness considerations: 

      The rules for assignment of OIDs requires that each OID be unique
      to the OID space and that it cannot be reassigned or reused. By
      reference this URN namespace inherents those rules. 

   Identifier persistence considerations: 

      The rules concerning the use of OIDs requires that they not be
      reused once assigned. By reference this URN namespace inherents
      those rules. 

   Process of identifier assignment: 

      Once an OID is assigned to some entity, that entity can then
      create and assign new OIDs below that particular OID. There are
      multiple entites that assign new OIDs to the general public. The
      top three levels are pre-assigned as follows: 
         0 - ITU-T assigned 
         1 - ISO assigned 
         2 - Joint ISO/ITU-T assignment 

      several assigned OIDs that are of importance to the Internet are: 
         1.3.6.1 - the Internet OID
         1.3.6.1.4.1 - IANA-assigned company OIDs, used for private

Internet-Draft             OID URN Namespace                  April 2000


         MIBs and such things 

   Process of identifier resolution: 

      At this time no resolution mechanism is defined. 

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence: 

      OIDs are composed of multiple occurences of digits and the "."
      character. Lexical equivalence is achieved by exact string match. 

   Conformance with URN Syntax: 

      There are no additional characters reserved. 

   Validation mechanism: 

      None. 

   Scope: 

      Global 


3. Examples

   The following examples are taken from the example OIDs from the
   Introduction: 
      urn:oid:1.3.6.1 
      urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1 
      urn:oid:1.3.6.1.2.1.27
      URN:OID:0.9.2342.19200300.100.4

4. Security Considerations

   None not already inherent to using unverifiable OIDs 

5. Acknowledgements

   OID database as a source for examples and references.
