Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The meaning and usage of the SIPS URI scheme and of TLS [RFC4346] is
   underspecified in SIP [RFC3261] and has been a source of confusion
   for implementers.

   This document provides clarifications and guidelines concerning the
   use of the SIPS URI scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
   It also makes normative changes to SIP (including both [RFC3261] and
   [RFC3608].  This document also provides a discussion of possible
   future steps in specification.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Background

3.1.  Models for Using TLS in SIP

   This section describes briefly the usage of TLS in SIP.

3.1.1.  Server-Provided Certificate

   In this model, only the TLS server provides a certificate during the
   TLS handshake.  This is applicable only between a UA and a proxy,
   where the UA is the TLS client and the proxy is the TLS server, and
   hence the UA uses TLS to authenticate the proxy but the proxy does
   not use TLS to authenticate the UA.  If the proxy needs to
   authenticate the UA, this can be achieved by SIP HTTP digest
   authentication.  This directionality implies that the TLS connection
   always needs to be setup by the UA (e.g., during the registration
   phase).  Since SIP allows for requests in both directions (e.g, an
   incoming call), the UA is expected to keep the TLS connection alive
   and that connection is expected to be re-used for both incoming and
   outgoing requests.

   This solution of having the UA always initiate and keep alive the
   connection also solves the NAT and firewall problem as it ensures
   that responses and further requests will always be deliverable on the
   existing connection.

   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] provides the mechanism for initiating and
   maintaining outbound connections in a standard interoperable way.

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


3.1.2.  Mutual authentication

   In this model, both the TLS client and the TLS server provide a
   certificate in the TLS handshake phase.  When used between a UA and a
   proxy (or between two UAs), this implies that a UA is in possession
   of a certificate.  When sending a SIP request when there is not
   already a suitable TLS connection in place, a UAC takes on the role
   of TLS client in establishing a new TLS connection.  When
   establishing a TLS connection for receipt of a SIP request, a UAS
   takes on the role of TLS server.  Since in SIP, a UA or a Proxy act
   both as UAC and UAS depending on if they are sending or receiving
   requests, the symmetrical nature of mutual TLS is very convenient.
   This allows for TLS connections to be set-up or torn down at will and
   does not rely on keeping the TLS connection alive for further
   requests.

   However, there are some significant limitations.

   The first obvious limitation is not with mutual authentication per
   se, but with the model where the underlying TCP connection can be
   established by either side, interchangeably, which is not possible in
   many environments.  For examples, NATs and firewalls will often allow
   TCP connections to be established in one direction only.  This
   includes most residential SIP deployments, for example.  Mutual
   authentication can be used in those environments, but only if the
   connection is always started by the same side, for example, by using
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] as described in Section 3.1.1.  Having to
   rely on [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] in this case negates many of the
   advantages of mutual authentication.

   The second significant limitation is that mutual authentication
   requires both sides to exchange a certificate.  This has proven to be
   impractical in many environments, in particular for SIP UAs, because
   of the difficulties of setting up a certificate infrastructure for a
   wide population of users.

   For these reasons, mutual authentication is mostly used in server-to-
   server communications (e.g., between SIP proxies, or between proxies
   and gateways or media servers), and in environments where using
   certificates on both sides is possible (e.g., high-security devices
   used within an enterprise).

3.1.3.  Using TLS with SIP instead of SIPS

   Because a SIPS URI implies that requests sent to the resource
   identified by it be sent over each SIP hop over TLS, SIPS URIs are
   not suitable for "best-effort TLS": they are only suitable for "TLS-
   only" requests.  This is recognized in section [RFC3261]/26.2.2:



Audet                    Expires August 26, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


      "Users that distribute a SIPS URI as an address-of-record may
      elect to operate devices that refuse requests over insecure
      transports."

   If one wants to use "best-effort TLS" for SIP, one just needs to use
   a SIP URI, and send the request over TLS.

   Using SIP over TLS is very simple.  A UA opens a TLS connection and
   uses SIP URIs instead of SIPS URIs for all the header fields in a SIP
   message (From, To, Request-URI, Contact header field, Route, etc.).
   When TLS is used, the Via header field indicates TLS.

   [RFC3261]/26.3.2.1 states:

      "When a UA comes online and registers with its local
      administrative domain, it SHOULD establish a TLS connection with
      its registrar (...).  Once the registration has been accepted by
      the registrar, the UA SHOULD leave this TLS connection open
      provided that the registrar also acts as the proxy server to which
      requests are sent for users in this administrative domain.  The
      existing TLS connection will be reused to deliver incoming
      requests to the UA that had just completed registration."

   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] describes how to establish and maintain a TLS
   connection in environments where it can only be initiated by the UA.

   Similarly, proxies can forward requests using TLS if they can open a
   TLS connection, even if the route set used SIP URIs instead of SIPS
   URIs.  The proxies can insert Record-Route header fields using SIP
   URIs even if it uses TLS transport.  [RFC3261]/26.3.2.2 explains how
   interdomain requests can use TLS.

   Some user agents, redirect servers and proxies might have local
   policies that enforce TLS on all connections, independently of if
   SIPS is used or not.

3.1.4.  Usage of the transport=tls URI Parameter and the TLS Via
        Parameter

   [RFC3261]/26.2.2 deprecated the "transport=tls" URI transport
   parameter in SIPS or SIP URIs:

      "Note that in the SIPS URI scheme, transport is independent of
      TLS, and thus "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=TCP" and
      "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=sctp" are both valid (although
      note that UDP is not a valid transport for SIPS).  The use of
      "transport=tls" has consequently been deprecated, partly because
      it was specific to a single hop of the request.  This is a change

      since RFC 2543."

   The "tls" parameter has not been eliminated from the ABNF in
   [RFC3261]/25 since the parameter needs to remain in the ABNF for
   backward compatibility in order for parsers to be able to process the
   parameter correctly.  The transport=tls parameter has never been
   defined in an RFC, but only in some of the Internet drafts between
   [RFC2543] and [RFC3261].

   This specification does not make use of the transport=tls parameter.

   The reinstatement of the transport=tls parameter, or an alternative
   mechanism for indicating the use of the TLS on a single hop in a URI,
   are outside the scope of this specification (see Appendix A.3).

   For Via header fields, the following transport protocol are defined
   in [RFC3261]: "UDP", "TCP", "TLS", "SCTP", and in [RFC4168]: "TLS-
   SCTP".

3.2.  Detection of Hop-by-Hop Security

   The presence of a SIPS Request-URI does not necessarily indicate that
   the request was sent securely on each hop.  So how does a UAS know if
   SIPS was used for the entire request path to secure the request end-
   to-end?  Effectively, the UAS cannot know for sure.  However,
   [RFC3261]/26.4.4 recommends how a UAS can make some checks to
   validate the security.  Additionally, the History-Info header field
   [RFC4244] could be inspected for detecting retargeting from SIP and
   SIPS.  Retargeting from SIP to SIPS by a proxy is an issue because it
   can leave the receiver of the request with the impression that the
   request was delivered securily on each hop, while in fact, in was
   not.

   To emphasize, all the checking can be circumvented by any proxies or
   B2BUAs on the path that do not follow the rules and recommendations
   of this specification and of [RFC3261].

   Proxies can have their own policies regarding routing of requests to
   SIP or SIPS URIs.  For example, some proxies in some environment can
   be configured to only route SIPS URIs.  Some proxies can be
   configured to detect non-compliances and reject un-secure requests.
   For example, proxies could inspect Request-URIs, Path, Record-Route,
   To, From, Contact header fields and Via header fields to enforce
   SIPS.

   [RFC3261]/26.4.4 explains that S/MIME can also be used by the
   originating UAC to ensure that the original form of the To header
   field is carried end-to-end.  While not specifically mentioned in



Audet                    Expires August 26, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


   [RFC3261]/26.4.4, this is meant to imply that [RFC3893] would be used
   to "tunnel" important header fields (such as To and From) in an
   encrypted and signed S/MIME body, replicating the information in the
   SIP message, and allowing the UAS to validate the content of those
   important header fields.  While this approach is certainly legal, a
   preferable approach is to use the SIP Identity mechanism defined in
   [RFC4474].  SIP Identity creates a signed identity digest which
   includes, amongst other things, the AOR of the sender (from the From
   header field) and the AOR of the original target (from the To header
   field).

3.3.  The Problems with the Meaning of SIPS in RFC 3261

   [RFC3261]/19.1 describes a SIPS URI as follows:

      "A SIPS URI specifies that the resource be contacted securely.
      This means, in particular, that TLS is to be used between the UAC
      and the domain that owns the URI.  From there, secure
      communications are used to reach the user, where the specific
      security mechanism depends on the policy of the domain."

   Section 26.2.2 re-iterates it, with regards to Request-URIs:

      "When used as the Request-URI of a request, the SIPS scheme
      signifies that each hop over which the request is forwarded, until
      the request reaches the SIP entity responsible for the domain
      portion of the Request-URI, must be secured with TLS; once it
      reaches the domain in question it is handled in accordance with
      local security and routing policy, quite possibly using TLS for
      any last hop to a UAS.  When used by the originator of a request
      (as would be the case if they employed a SIPS URI as the address-
      of-record of the target), SIPS dictates that the entire request
      path to the target domain be so secured."

   Let's take the classic SIP trapezoid to explain the meaning of a
   sips:b@B URI.  Instead of using real domain names like example.com
   and example.net, logical names like "A" and "B" are used, for
   clarity.

                   SIP trapezoid with last hop exception

   According to [RFC3261], if a@A is sending a request to sips:b@B, the
   following applies:
   o  TLS is required between UA a@A and Proxy A
   o  TLS is required between Proxy A and Proxy B
   o  TLS is required between Proxy B and UA b@B, depending on local
      policy.

   One can then wonder why TLS is mandatory between UA a@A and Proxy A
   but not between Proxy B and UA b@B. The main reason is that [RFC3261]
   was written before [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  At that time, it was
   recognized that in many practical deployments, Proxy B might not be
   able to establish a TLS connection with UA b because only Proxy B
   would have a certificate to provide and UA b would not.  Since UA b
   would be the TLS Server, it would then not be able to accept the
   incoming TLS connection.  The consequence is that an [RFC3261]-
   compliant UAS b, while it might not need to support TLS for incoming
   requests, will nevertheless have to support TLS for outgoing requests
   as it takes the UAC role.  Contrary to what many believed
   erroneously, the last-hop exception was not created to allow for
   using a SIPS URI to address a UAS that does not support TLS: the
   last-hop exception was an attempt to allow for incoming requests to
   not be transported over TLS when a SIPS URI is used, and it does not
   apply to outgoing requests.  The rationale for this was somewhat
   flawed, and since then, [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] has provided a more



Audet                    Expires August 26, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


   satisfactory solution to this problem.  [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] also
   solves the problem that if UA b is behind a NAT or Firewall, proxy B
   would not even be able to establish a TCP session in the first place.

   Furthermore, consider the problem of using SIPS inside a dialog.  If
   a@A sends a request to b@B using a SIPS Request-URI, then, according
   to [RFC3261]/8.1.1.8, "the Contact header field MUST contain a SIPS
   URI as well".  This means that b@B, upon sending a new Request within
   the dialog (e.g., a BYE or re-INVITE), will have to use a SIPS URI.
   If there is no Record-Route entry, or if the last Record-Route entry
   consist of a SIPS URI, this implies that b@B is expected to
   understand SIPS in the first place, and is required to also support
   TLS.  If the last Record-Route entry however is a sip URI, then b
   would be able to send requests without using TLS (but b would still
   have to be able to handle SIPS schemes when parsing the message).  In
   either case, the Request-URI in the request from b@B to B would be a
   SIPS URI.


4.  Overview of Operations

   Because of all the problems described in Section 3.3, this
   specification deprecates the last hop exception when forwarding a
   request to the last hop (see Section 5.3).  This will ensure that TLS
   is used on all hops all the way up to the remote target.

                 SIP trapezoid without last hop exception

   The SIPS scheme implies transitive trust.  Obviously, there is
   nothing that prevents proxies from cheating (see [RFC3261]/26.4.4).
   While SIPS is useful to request that a resource be contacted
   securely, it is not useful as an indication that a resource was in
   fact contacted securely.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to infer
   that because an incoming request had a Request-URI (or even a To
   header field) containing a SIPS URI, that it necessarily guarantees
   that the request was in fact transmitted securely on each hop.  Some
   have been tempted to believe that the SIPS scheme was equivalent to
   an HTTPS scheme in the sense that one could provide a visual
   indication to a user (e.g., a padlock icon) to the effect that the
   session is secured.  This is obviously not the case, and therefore
   the meaning of a SIPS URI is not to be oversold.  There is currently
   no mechanism to provide an indication of end-to-end security for SIP.
   Other mechanisms can provide a more concrete indication of some level
   of security.  For example, SIP Identity [RFC4474] provides an
   authenticated identity mechanism and a domain-to-domain integrity
   protection mechanism.

   Some have asked why is SIPS useful in a global open environment such
   as the Internet, if (when used in a Request-URI) it is not an
   absolute guarantee that the request will in fact be delivered over
   TLS on each hop?  Why is SIPS any different than just using TLS
   transport with SIP?  The difference is that using a SIPS URI in a
   Request-URI means that if you are instructing the network to use TLS
   over each hop, and if it is not possible, to reject the request:
   i.e., that you would rather have the request fail than have the
   request delivered without TLS.  Just using TLS with a SIP Request-URI
   instead of a SIPS Request-URI implies a "best-effort" service: the
   request can but need not be delivered over TLS on each hop.

   Another common question is why not have a Proxy-Require and Require
   option tag forcing the use of TLS instead?  The answer is that it
   would only be functionally equivalent to using SIPS in a Request-URI.
   SIPS URIs however can be used in many other header fields: in Contact
   for registration, Contact in dialog-creating requests, Route, Record-
   Route, Path, From, To, Refer-To, Referred-By, etc.  SIPS URIs can
   also be used in human-usable format (e.g., business cards, user
   interface, etc.).  SIPS URIs can even be used in other protocols or
   document formats that allow for including SIPS URIs (e.g., HTML).

   This document specifies that SIPS means that the SIP resource
   designated by the target SIPS URI is to be contacted securely, using
   TLS on each hop between the UAC and the remote UAS (as opposed to
   only to the proxy responsible for the target domain of the Request-
   URI).  It is outside of the scope of this document to specify what

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


   happens when a SIPS URI identifies a UAS resource that "maps" outside
   of the SIP network, for example, to other networks such as the PSTN.

4.1.  Routing

   SIP and SIPS URIs that are identical except for the scheme itself
   (e.g., sip:alice@example.com and sips:alice@example.com) refer to the
   same resource.  This requirement is implicit in [RFC3261]/19.1 which
   states that "Any resource described by a SIP URI can be "upgraded" to
   a SIPS URI by just changing the scheme, if it is desired to
   communicate with that resource securely".  This does not mean that
   the SIPS URI will necessarily be reachable, in particular, if the
   proxy cannot establish a secure connection to a client or another
   proxy.  This does not suggest either that proxies would arbitrarily
   "upgrade" SIP URIs to SIPS URIs when forwarding a request (see
   Section 5.3).  Rather, it means that when a resource is addressable
   with SIP, it will also be addressable with SIPS.

   For example, consider the case of a UA that has registered with a
   SIPS Contact header field.  If a UAC later addresses a request using
   a SIP Request-URI, the proxy will forward the request addressed to a
   SIP Request-URI to the UAS, as illustrated by message F13 in
   Section 6.3 and in Section 6.4.  The proxy forwards the request to
   the UA using a SIP Request-URI and not the SIPS Request-URI used in
   registration.  The proxy does this by replacing the SIPS scheme that
   was used in the registered Contact header field binding with a SIP
   scheme while leaving the rest of the URI as is, and then by using
   this new URI as the Request-URI.  If the proxy did not do this, and
   instead used a SIPS Request-URI, then the response (e.g., a 200 to an
   INVITE) would have to include a SIPS Contact header field.  That SIPS
   Contact header field would then force the other UA to use a SIPS
   Contact header field in any mid-dialog request, including the ACK
   (which would not be possible if that UA did not support SIPS).

   This specification mandates that when a proxy is forwarding a
   request, a resource described by a SIPS Request-URI cannot be
   "downgraded" to a SIP URI by changing the scheme, or by sending the
   associated request over a non-secure link.  If a request needs to be
   rejected because otherwise it would be a "downgrade", the request
   would be rejected with a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response
   (potentially with a Warning header with warn-code 380 "SIPS Not
   Allowed").  Similarly, this specification mandates that when a proxy
   is forwarding a request, a resource described by a SIP Request-URI
   cannot be "upgraded" to a SIPS URI by changing the scheme (otherwise
   it would be an "upgrade" only for that hop onwards rather than on all
   hops, and would therefore mislead the UAS).  If a request needs to be
   rejected because otherwise it would be a misleading "upgrade", the
   request would be rejected with a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)

   response (potentially with a Warning header field with warn-code 381
   "SIPS Required").  See Section 5.3 for more details.

   For example, the sip:bob@example.com and sips:bob@example.com AORs
   refers to the same user "Bob" in the domain "example.com": the first
   URI is the SIP version, and the second one is the SIPS version.  From
   the point of view of routing, requests to either sip:bob@example.com
   and sips:bob@example.com are treated the same way.  When Bob
   registers, it therefore does not really matter if he is using a SIP
   or a SIPS AOR, since they both refer to the same user.  At first
   glance, section [RFC3261]/19.1.4 seems to contradict this idea by
   stating that a SIP and a SIPS URI are never equivalent.
   Specifically, it says that they are never equivalent for the purpose
   of comparing bindings in Contact header field URIs in REGISTER
   requests.  The key point is that this statement applies to the
   Contact header field bindings in a registration: it is the
   association of the Contact header field with the AOR that will
   determine if the user is reachable or not with a SIPS URI.

   Consider this example: if Bob (AOR bob@example.com) registers with a
   SIPS Contact header field (e.g., sips:bob@bobphone.example.com), the
   registrar and the location service then know that Bob is reachable at
   sips:bob@bobphone.example.com, and at sip:bob@bobphone.example.com.
   If a request is sent to AOR sips:bob@example.com, Bob's proxy will
   route it to Bob at Request-URI sips:bob@bobphone.example.com.  If a
   request is sent to AOR sip:bob@example.com, Bob's proxy will route it
   to Bob at Request-URI sip:bob@bobphone.example.com.

   If Bob wants to ensure that every request delivered to him always be
   transported over TLS, Bob can use [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] when
   registering.

   However, if Bob had registered with a SIP Contact header field
   instead of a SIPS Contact header field (e.g.,
   sip:bob@bobphone.example.com), then a request to AOR
   sips:bob@example.com would not be routed to Bob, since there is no
   SIPS Contact header field for Bob, and "downgrades" from SIPS to SIP
   are not allowed.

   See Section 6 for illustrative call flows.

   This section describes all the normative requirements defined by this
   specification.

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


5.1.  General User Agent Behavior

5.1.1.  UAC Behavior

   When presented with a SIPS URI, a UAC MUST NOT change it to a SIP
   URI.  For example, if a directory entry includes a SIPS AOR, the UAC
   is not expected to send requests to that AOR using a SIP Request-URI.
   Similarly, if a user reads a business card with a SIPS URI, it is not
   possible to infer a SIP URI.  If a 3XX response includes a SIPS
   Contact header field, the UAC does not replace it with a SIP Request-
   URI (e.g., by replacing the SIPS scheme with a SIP scheme) when
   sending a request as a result of the redirection.

   As mandated by [RFC3261]/8.1.1.8, in a request, "If the Request-URI
   or top Route header field value contains a SIPS URI, the Contact
   header field MUST contain a SIPS URI as well".

   Upon receiving a 416 response or a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
   response with a Warning header with warn-code 380 "SIPS Not Allowed",
   a UAC MUST NOT re-attempt the request by automatically replacing the
   SIPS scheme with a SIP scheme as described in [RFC3261]/8.1.3.5 as it
   would be a security vulnerability.  If the UAC does re-attempt the
   call with a SIP URI, the UAC SHOULD get a confirmation from the user
   to authorize re-initiating the session with a SIP Request-URI instead
   of a SIPS Request-URI.

   When the route set is not empty (e.g., when a service route [RFC3608]
   is returned by the registrar), it is the responsibility of the UAC to
   use a Route header field consisting of all SIPS URIs when using a
   SIPS Request-URI.  Specifically, if the route set included any SIP
   URI, the UAC MUST change the SIP URIs to SIPS URIs simply by changing
   the scheme from "sip" to "sips" before sending the request.  This
   allows for configuring or discovering one service route with all SIP
   URIs and allowing sending requests to both SIP and SIPS URIs.

   When the UAC is using a SIP Request-URI, if the route set is not
   empty and the topmost Route header field entry is a SIPS URI with the
   lr parameter, the UAC MUST send the request over TLS (using a SIP
   Request-URI).  If the route is not empty and the Route header field
   entry is a SIPS URI without the lr parameter, the UAC MUST send the
   request over TLS using a SIPS Request-URI corresponding to the
   topmost entry in the route set.

   To emphasise what is already defined in [RFC3261], UAs MUST NOT use
   the "transport=tls" parameter.

5.1.1.1.  Registration

   The UAC registers Contacts header fields to either a SIPS or a SIP
   AOR.

   If a UA wishes to be reachable with a SIPS URI, the UA MUST register
   with a SIPS Contact header field.  Requests addressed to that UA's
   AOR using either a SIP or SIPS Request-URI will be routed to that UA.
   This includes UAs that support both SIP and SIPS.  This specification
   does not provide any SIP-based mechanism for a UA to provision its
   proxy to only forward requests using a SIPS Request-URI.  A non-SIP
   mechanism such as a web interface could be used to provision such a
   preference.  A SIP mechanism for provisioning such a preference is
   outside the scope of this specification.

   If a UA does not wish to be reached with a SIPS URI, it MUST register
   with a SIP Contact header field.

   Because registering with a SIPS Contact header field implies a
   binding of both a SIPS Contact and a corresponding SIP Contact to the
   AOR, a UA MUST NOT include both the SIPS and the SIP version of the
   same Contact header field in a REGISTER request; the UA MUST only use
   the SIPS version in this case.  Similarly, a UA SHOULD NOT register
   both a SIP Contact header field and a SIPS Contact header field in
   separate registrations as the SIP Contact header field would be
   superfluous.  If it does, the second registration replaces the first
   one (e.g., a UA could register first with a SIP Contact header field
   - meaning it does not support SIPS- and later register with a SIPS
   Contact header field (meaning it now supports SIPS).

   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] can be used by a UA if it wants to ensure
   that no requests are delivered to it without using the TLS connection
   it used when registering.

   If all the Contact header fields in a REGISTER request are SIPS, the
   UAC MUST use SIPS AORs in the From and To header fields in the
   REGISTER request.  If at least one of the Contact header fields is
   not SIPS (e.g., sip, mailto, tel, http, https), the UAC MUST use SIP
   AORs in the From and To header fields in the REGISTER request.

   To emphasise what is already defined in [RFC3261], UACs MUST NOT use
   the "transport=tls" parameter.

5.1.1.2.  SIPS in a Dialog

   If the Request-URI in a request that initiates a dialog is a SIP URI,
   then the UAC needs to be careful about what to use in the Contact
   header field (in case Record-Route is not used for this hop).  If the



Audet                    Expires August 26, 2008               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


   Contact header field was a SIPS URI, it would mean that the UAS would
   only accept mid-dialog requests that are sent over secure transport
   on each hop.  Since the Request-URI in this case is a SIP URI, it is
   quite possible that the UA sending a request to that URI might not be
   able to send requests to SIPS URIs.  If the top Route header field
   does not contain a SIPS URI, the UAC MUST use a SIP URI in the
   Contact header field, even if the request is sent over a secure
   transport (e.g., the first hop could be re-using a TLS connection to
   the proxy as would be the case with [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound]).

   When a target refresh occurs within a dialog (e.g., re-INVITE
   request, UPDATE request), the UAC MUST include a Contact header field
   with a SIPS URI if the original request used a SIPS Request-URI.

5.1.1.3.  Derived Dialogs and Transactions

   Sessions, dialogs and transactions can be "derived" from existing
   ones.  A good example of a derived dialog is one that was established
   as a result of using the REFER method [RFC3515].

   As a general principle, derived dialogs and transactions cannot
   result in an effective downgrading of SIPS to SIP, without the
   explicit authorization of the entities involved.

   For example, when a REFER request is used to perform a call transfer,
   it results in an existing dialog being terminated and another one
   being created based on the Refer-To URI.  If that initial dialog was
   established using SIPS, then the UAC MUST NOT establish a new one
   using SIP, unless there is an explicit authorization given by the
   recipient of the REFER request.  This could be a warning provided to
   the user.  Having such a warning could be useful for example for a
   secure directory service application, resulting in being routed to a
   UA that does not support SIPS.

   A REFER request can also be used for referring to resources that do
   not result in dialogs being created.  In fact, a REFER request can be
   used to point to resources that are of a different type than the
   original one (i.e., not SIP or SIPS).  Please see [RFC3515]/5.2 for
   security considerations related to this.

   Other examples of derived dialogs and transactions include the use of
   Third-Party Call Control [RFC3725], the Replaces header field
   [RFC3891], and the Join header field [RFC3911].  Again, the general
   principle is that these mechanism SHOULD NOT result in an effective
   downgrading of SIPS to SIP, without the proper authorization.

5.1.1.4.  GRUU

   When a GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] is assigned to an instance ID/AOR
   pair, both SIP and SIPS GRUUs will be assigned.  When a GRUU is
   obtained through registration, if the Contact header field in the
   REGISTER request contains a SIP URI, the SIP version of the GRUU is
   returned.  If the Contact header field in the REGISTER request
   contains a SIPS URI, the SIPS version of the GRUU is returned.

   If the wrong scheme is received in the GRUU (which would be an error
   in the registrar), the UAC SHOULD treat it as if the proper scheme
   was used (i.e., it SHOULD replace the scheme with the proper scheme
   before using the GRUU).

5.1.2.  UAS Behavior

   When presented with a SIPS URI, a UAS MUST NOT change it to a SIP
   URI.

   As mandated by [RFC3261]/12.1.1, "If the request that initiated the
   dialog contained a SIPS URI in the Request-URI or in the top Record-
   Route header field value, if there was any, or the Contact header
   field if there was no Record-Route header field, the Contact header
   field in the response MUST be a SIPS URI".

   If a UAS does not wish to be reached with a SIPS URI but only with a
   SIP URI, the UAS MUST respond with a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
   response.  The UAS SHOULD include a Warning header with warn-code 380
   "SIPS Not Allowed".  [RFC3261]/8.2.2.1 states that UASs that do not
   support the SIPS URI scheme at all "SHOULD reject the request with a
   416 (Unsupported URI scheme) response".

   If a UAS does not wish to be contacted with a SIP URI but instead by
   a SIPS URI, it MUST reject a request to a SIP Request-URI with a 480
   (Temporarily Unavailable) response.  The UAS SHOULD include a Warning
   header with warn-code 381 "SIPS Required".

   It is a matter of local policy for a UAS to accept incoming requests
   addressed to a URI scheme that does not correspond to what it used
   for registration.  For example, a UA with a policy of "always SIPS"
   would address the Registrar using a SIPS Request-URI over TLS, would
   register with a SIPS Contact header field, and the UAS would reject
   requests using the SIP scheme with a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
   response with a Warning header with warn-code 381 "SIPS Required".  A
   UA with a policy of "best-effort SIPS" would address the Registrar
   using a SIPS Request-URI over TLS, would register with a SIPS Contact
   header field, and the UAS would accept requests addressed to either
   SIP or SIPS Request-URIs.  A UA with a policy of "No SIPS" would

Internet-Draft                    SIPS                     February 2008


   address the Registrar using a SIP Request-URI, could use TLS or not,
   would register with a SIP AOR and a SIP Contact header field, and the
   UAS would accept requests addressed to a SIP Request-URI.

   If a UAS needs to reject a request because the URIs are used
   inconsistenty (e.g,, the Request-URI is a SIPS URI, but the Contact
   header field is a SIP URI), the UAS MUST reject the request with a
   400 (Bad Request) response.

   When a target refresh occurs within a dialog (e.g., re-INVITE
   request, UPDATE request), the UAS MUST include a Contact header field
   with a SIPS URI if the original request used a SIPS Request-URI.

   To emphasise what is already defined in [RFC3261], UASa MUST NOT use
   the "transport=tls" parameter.

5.2.  Registrar Behavior

   The UAC registers Contacts header fields to either a SIPS or a SIP
   AOR.  From a routing perspective, it does not matter which one is
   used for registration as they identify the same resource.  The
   registrar MUST consider AORs that are identical except for one having
   the SIP scheme and the other having the SIPS scheme to be equivalent.

   A registrar MUST only accept a binding to a SIPS Contact header field
   if all the appropriate URIs are of the SIPS scheme, otherwise there
   could be an inadvertent binding of a secure resource (SIPS) to an
   unsecured one (SIP).  This includes the Request-URI, the Contacts and
   all the Path header fields, but does not include the From and To
   header fields.  If the URIs are not of the proper SIPS scheme, the
   registrar MUST reject the REGISTER with a 400 (Bad Request).

   A registrar can return a service route [RFC3608] and impose some
   constraints on whether TLS will be mandatory or not on specific hops.
   For example, if the topmost entry in the Path header field returned
   by the registrar is a SIPS URI, the registrar is telling the UAC that
   TLS is to be be used for the first hop, even if the Request-URI is
   SIP.

   If a UA registered with a SIPS Contact header field, the registrar
   returning a service route [RFC3608] MUST return a service route
   consisting of SIP URIs if the intent of the registrar is to allow
   both SIP and SIPS to be used in requests sent by that client.  If a
   UA registers with a SIPS Contact header field, the registrar
   returning a service route MUST return a service route consisting of
   SIPS URIs if the intent of the registrar is to allow only SIPS URIs
   to be used in requests sent by that UA.

5.2.1.  GRUU

   When a GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] is assigned to an instance ID/AOR
   pair through registration, the registrar MUST assign both a SIP GRUU
   and a SIPS GRUU.  If the Contact header field in the REGISTER request
   contains a SIP URI, the registrar MUST return the SIP version of the
   GRUU.  If the Contact header field in the REGISTER request contains a
   SIPS URI, the registrar MUST return the SIPS version of the GRUU.

5.3.  Proxy Behavior

   Proxies MUST NOT use the last hop exception of [RFC3261] when
   forwarding or retargeting a request to the last hop.  Specifically,
   when a proxy receives a request with a SIPS Request-URI, the proxy
   MUST only forward or retarget the request to a SIPS Request-URI.  If
   the target UAS had registered previously using a SIP Contact header
   field instead of a SIPS Contact header field, the proxy MUST NOT
   forward the request to the URI indicated in the Contact header field.
   If the proxy needs to reject the request for that reason, the proxy
   MUST reject it with a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response.  In
   this case, the proxy SHOULD include a Warning header with warn-code
   380 "SIPS Not Allowed".

   Proxies SHOULD transport requests using a SIP URI over TLS when it is
   possible to set up a TLS connection, or re-use an existing one.
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] for example, allows for re-using an existing
   TLS connection.  Some proxies could have policies that prohibit
   sending any request over anything but TLS.

   When a proxy receives a request with a SIP Request-URI, the proxy
   MUST NOT forward the request to a SIPS Request-URI.  If the target
   UAS had registered previously using a SIPS Contact header field, and
   the proxy decides to forward the request, the proxy MUST replace that
   SIPS scheme with a SIP scheme while leaving the rest of the URI as
   is, and use the resulting URI as the Request-URI of the forwarded
   request.  The proxy MUST use TLS to forward the request to the UAS.
   Some proxies could have a policy of not forwarding at all requests
   using a non-SIPS Request-URI if the UAS had registered using a SIPS
   Contact header fields.  If the proxy elects to reject the request
   because it has such a policy or because it is not capable of
   establishing a TLS connection, the proxy MAY reject it with a 480
   (Temporarily Unavailable) response with a Warning header with warn-
   code 381 "SIPS Required".

   If a proxy needs to reject a request because the URIs are used
   inconsistenty (e.g,, the Request-URI is a SIPS URI, but the Contact
   header field is a SIP URI), the proxy SHOULD use response code 400
   (Bad Request).

   It is RECOMMENDED that the proxy use the outbound proxy procedures
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] for supporting UACs that cannot
   provide a certificate for establishing a TLS connection (i.e., when
   server-side authentication is used).

   When a proxy sends a request using a SIPS Request-URI and receives a
   3XX response with a SIP Contact header field, or, a 416 response, or
   a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response with a Warning header with
   warn-code 380 "SIPS Not Allowed" response, the proxy MUST NOT recurse
   on the response.  In this case, the proxy SHOULD forward the best
   response instead of recursing, in order to allow for the UAC to take
   the appropriate action.

   When a proxy sends a request using a SIP Request-URI and receives a
   3XX response with a SIPS Contact header field, or, a 480 (Temporarily
   Unavailable) response with a Warning header with warn-code 381 "SIPS
   Required", the proxy MUST NOT recurse on the response.  In this case,
   the proxy SHOULD forward the best response instead of recursing, in
   order to allow for the UAC to take the appropriate action.

   To emphasise what is already defined in [RFC3261], proxies MUST NOT
   use the "transport=tls" parameter.

5.4.  Redirect Server Behavior

   Using a redirect server with TLS instead of using a proxy has some
   limitations that have to be taken into account.  Since there no pre-
   established connection between the proxy and the UAS (such as with
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound]), it is only appropriate for scenarios where
   inbound connections are allowed.  For example, it could be used in a
   server to server environment (redirect server or proxy server) where
   TLS mutual authentication is used, and where there are no NAT
   traversal issues.  A redirect server would not be able to redirect to
   an entity that does not have a certificate.  A redirect server might
   not be usable if there is a NAT between the server and the UAS.

   When a redirect server receives a request with a SIP Request-URI, the
   redirect server MAY redirect with a 3XX response to either a SIP or a
   SIPS Contact header field.  If the target UAS had registered
   previously using a SIPS Contact header field, the redirect server
   SHOULD return a SIPS Contact header field if it is in an environment
   where TLS is usable (as described in the previous paragraph).  If the
   target UAS had registered previously using a SIP Contact header
   field, the redirect server MUST return a SIP Contact header field in
   a 3XX response if it redirects the request.

   When a redirect server receives a request with a SIPS Request-URI,
   the redirect server MAY redirect with a 3XX response to a SIP or a

   SIPS Contact header field.  If the target UAS had registered
   previously using a SIPS Contact header field, the redirect server
   SHOULD return a SIPS Contact header field if it is in an environment
   where TLS is usable.  If the target UAS had registered previously
   using a SIP Contact header field, the redirect server MUST return a
   SIP Contact header field in a 3XX response if it chooses to redirect;
   otherwise the UAS MAY reject the request with a 480 (Temporarily
   Unavailable) response with a Warning header with warn-code 380 "SIPS
   Not Allowed".  If a redirect server redirects to a UAS that it has no
   knowledge of (e.g., a AOR in a different domain), the Contact header
   field could be of any scheme.

   If a redirect server needs to reject a request because the URIs are
   used inconsistenty (e.g,, the Request-URI is a SIPS URI, but the
   Contact header field is a SIP URI), the redirect server SHOULD use
   response code 400 (Bad Request).

   To emphasise what is already defined in [RFC3261], redirect servers
   MUST NOT use the "transport=tls" parameter.

                                 Topology

   In the following examples, Bob has two clients, one is a SIP PC
   client running on his computer, and the other one is a SIP Phone.
   The PC client does not support SIPS and consequently only registers
   with a SIP Contact header field.  The SIP phone however does support
   SIPS and TLS, and consequently registers with a SIPS Contact header
   field.  Both of Bob's devices are going through Edge Proxy B, and
   consequently, they include a Route header field indicating
   eb.example.com.  Edge Proxy B removes the Route header field
   corresponding to itself, and adds itself in a Path header field.  The
   registration process call flow is illustrated in Section 6.1.

   After registration, there are two Contact bindings associated with
   Bob's AOR of bob@example.com: sips:bob@bobphone.example.com and
   sip:bob@bobpc.example.com.

   Alice then calls Bob through her own Proxy A. Proxy A locates Bob's
   domain example.com.  In this example, that domain is owned by Bob's
   Registrar/Authoritative Proxy B. Proxy A removes the Route header
   field corresponding to itself, and inserts itself in the Record-Route
   and forwards the request to Registrar/Authoritative Proxy B.

   The following subsections illustrates registration and three
   examples.  In the first example (Section 6.2), Alice calls Bob using
   Bob's SIPS URI.  In the second example (Section 6.3), Alice calls
   Bob's SIP AOR using TCP transport.  In the third example
   (Section 6.4), Alice calls Bob's SIP AOR using TLS transport.

6.1.  Bob Registers his Contacts

   This flow illustrates the registration process by which Bob's device
   registers.  His PC client (Bob@bobpc) registers with a SIP scheme and
   his SIP Phone (Bob@phone) registers with a SIPS scheme.

6.2.  Alice Calls Bob's SIPS AOR

   Bob's registration has already occurred as per Section 6.1.

   In this first example, Alice calls Bob's SIPS AOR

   request is only sent to sips:bob@bobphone.example.com, through Edge

   inserts themselves in the Record-Route.  Bob answers at
   sips:bob@bobphone.example.com.

6.3.  Alice Calls Bob's SIP AOR using TCP

   Bob's registration has already occurred as per Section 6.1.

   In the second example, Alice calls Bob's SIP AOR instead
   (sip:bob@example.com), and she uses TCP as a transport.  Registrar/
   Authoritative Proxy B consults the binding in the registration
   database, and finds the two Contact header field bindings.  Alice had
   addressed Bob with a SIP Request-URI (sip:bob@example.com), so
   Registrar/Authoritative Proxy B determines that the calls needs to be
   routed both to bobpc (which registered with a SIP Contact header
   field) and bobphone (which registered with a SIPS Contact header
   field), and therefore the request is forked to
   sip:bob@bobpc.example.com and sip:bob@bobphone.example.com, through
   Edge Proxy B. Note that Registar/Authoritative Proxy B preserved the
   SIP scheme of the Request-URI instead of replacing it with the SIPS
   scheme of the Contact header field that was used for registration.
   Both Registrar/Authoritative Proxy B and Edge Proxy B inserts

   themselves in the Record-Route.  Bob's phone's policy is to accept
   calls to SIP and SIPS (i.e., "best effort") so both his PC Client and
   his SIP Phone ring simultaneously.  Bob answers on his SIP phone, and
   the forked call leg to the PC client is canceled.

6.4.  Alice Calls Bob's SIP AOR using TLS

   Bob's registration has already occurred as per Section 6.1.

   The third example is identical to the second one, except that Alice
   uses TLS as the transport for her connection to her proxy.  Such an
   arrangement would be common if Alice's UA supported TLS and wanted to
   use a single connection to the proxy (as would be the case when using
   [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound]).  In the example below, Proxy A is also
   using TLS as a transport to communicate with Outbound proxy B, but it
   is not necessarily the case.

   When using a SIP URI in the Request-URI, but TLS as a transport for
   sending the request, the Via field indicates TLS.  The Route header
   field (if present) typically would use a SIP URI (but it could also
   be a SIPS URI).  The Contact header fields, To and From however would
   also normally indicate a SIP URI.

   The call flow would be exactly as per the second example
   (Section 6.3).  The only difference would be that all the Via header
   fields would use TLS Via parameters.  The URIs would remain SIP URIs
   and not SIPS URIs.

7.  Further Considerations

   SIP [RFC3261] itself introduces some complications with using SIPS,
   for example when Record-Route is not used.  When a SIPS URI is used
   in a Contact header field in a dialog-initiating request and Record-
   Route is not used, that SIPS URI might not be usable by the other
   end.  If the other end does not support SIPS and/or TLS, it will not
   be able to use it.  The "last-hop exception" is an example of when
   this can occur.  In this case, using Record-Route so that the
   requests are sent through proxies can help in making it work.
   Another example is that even in a case where the Contact header field
   is a SIPS URI, no Record-Route is used, and the far end supports SIPS
   and TLS, it might still not be possible for the far end to establish
   a TLS connection with the SIP originating end if the certificate
   cannot be validated by the far end.  This could typically be the case
   if the originating end was using server-side authentication as
   described below, or if the originating end is not using a certificate
   that can be validated.

   TLS itself has a significant impact on how SIPS can be used.
   "Server-side authentication" (where the server side provides its
   certificate but the client side does not) is typically used between a
   SIP end-user device acting as the TLS client side (e.g., a phone or a
   personal computer), and its SIP server (proxy or registrar) acting as
   the TLS server side.  TLS mutual authentication (where both the
   client and the server side provide their respective certificates) is
   typically used between SIP servers (proxies, registrars), or
   statically configured devices such as PSTN gateways or media servers.
   In the mutual authentication model, for two entities to be able to
   establish a TLS connection, it is required that both sides be able to
   validate each other's certificates, either by static configuration or
   by being able to recurse to a valid root certificate.  With server-
   side authentication, only the client side is capable of validating
   the server side's certificate, as the client side does not provide a
   certificate.  The consequences of all this are that whenever a SIPS
   URI is used to establish a TLS connection, it is expected to be
   possible for the entity establishing the connection (the client) to
   validate the certificate from the server side.  For server-side
   authentication, [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound] is the recommended approach.
   For mutual authentication, one needs to ensure that the architecture
   of the network is such that connections are made between entities
   that have access to each other's certificates.  Record-Route
   [RFC3261] and Path [RFC3327] are very useful in ensuring that
   previously established TLS connections can be re-used.  Other
   mechanisms might also be used in certain circumstances: for example,
   using root certificates that are widely recognized allows for more
   easily created TLS connections.

   The "last hop exception" introduces significant potential
   vulnerabilities in SIP and it has therefore been deprecated by this
   specification.


8.  Security Considerations

   Most of this document can be considered to be security considerations
   since it applies to the usage of the SIPS URI.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers two new warning codes, namely 380 "No
   SIPS Contacts Registered" and 381 "SIPS Required".  The warning codes
   are defined by the following information, to be included in the Warn-
   codes sub-registry under
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

   380  SIPS Not Allowed: The UAS or proxy cannot process the request
        because the SIPS scheme is not allowed (e.g., because there are
        currently no registered SIPS Contacts).

   381  SIPS Required: The UAS or proxy cannot process the request
        because the SIPS scheme is required.

   Reference: RFC XXX [Note to IANA Editor, please replace with RFC
   number of this document]

   The note in the Registry name entry for Warning codes on
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters should be:

      Warning codes provide information supplemental to the status code
      in SIP response messages.


10.  IAB Considerations

   There are no IAB considerations.

Appendix A.  Future Steps in Specification

   This section is a placeholder for a discussion of possible future
   steps in specification, and the pros and cons of making such changes.
   Protocol and normative changes to any specifications (such as RFC
   3261) resulting from this discussion would be specified in further
   documents.

A.1.  Indication of Validity of SIPS

   Since the presence of a SIPS URI in a Request-URI in an incoming
   request currently does not guarantee that SIPS and TLS was indeed
   used on every hop along the path, it has been suggested that it would

   be useful to define a mechanism for a verifiable assertion that TLS
   and SIPS were used on every hop.

A.2.  True End-to-End Encryption of SIP

   Another suggestion has been to define a mechanism to encrypt SIP end-
   to-end.  This would require either an peer-to-peer SIP model, or
   alternatively a mechanism that allows the encrypted SIP signalling to
   be tunnelled through proxies.  [I-D.gurbani-sip-sipsec] is an example
   of such a mechanism.

A.3.  Use of the transport parameter for TLS on a single hop

   A way to describe in a URI that TLS is intended to be used on a
   specific hop (similar to what transport=tls used to mean) has been
   suggested as a possible area for future steps in specification.  See
   discussion in Section 3.1.4.


Appendix B.  Bug Fixes for RFC 3261

   The last sentence of the fifth paragraph of 8.1.3.5 is replaced by:

      The client SHOULD retry the request, this time, using a SIP URI
      unless the original Request-URI used a SIPS scheme, in which case
      the client MUST NOT retry the request automatically.

   The fifth paragraph of section 10.2.1 is replaced by:

      If the address-of-record in the To header field of a REGISTER
      request is a SIPS URI, then the UAC MUST also include only SIPS
      URIs in any Contact header field value in the requests.

   In section 16.7 on p. 112 describing Record-Route, the second
   paragraph is deleted.

   The last paragraph of section 19.1 is reworded as follows:

      A SIPS URI specifies that the resource be contacted securely.
      This means, in particular, that TLS is to be used on each hop
      between the UAC and the resource identified by the target SIPS
      URI.  Any resources described by a SIP URI (...)

   In the third paragraph of section 20.43, the words "the session
   description" in the first sentence are replaced with "SIP".  Later in
   the paragraph, "390" is replaced with "380", and "miscellaneous
   warnings" is replaced with "miscellaneous SIP-related warnings".

   The second paragraph of section 26.2.2 is reworded as follows:

      (...)  When used as the Request-URI of a request, the SIPS scheme
      signifies that each hop over which the request is forwarded, until
      the request reaches the resource identified by the Request-URI, is
      secured with TLS.  When used by the originator of a request (as
      would be the case if they employed a SIPS URI as the address-of-
      record of the target), SIPS dictates that the entire request path
      to the target domain be so secured.

   The first paragraph of section 26.4.4 is replaced by the following:

      Actually using TLS on every segment of a request path entails that
      the terminating UAS is reachable over TLS (by registering with a
      SIPS URI as a contact address).  The SIPS scheme implies
      transitive trust.  Obviously, there is nothing that prevents
      proxies from cheating.  Thus SIPS cannot guarantee that TLS usage
      will be truly respected end-to-end on each segment of a request
      path.  Note that since many UAs will not accept incoming TLS
      connections, even those UAs that do support TLS will be required
      to maintain persistent TLS connections as described in the TLS
      limitations section above in order to receive requests over TLS as
      a UAS.

   The fourth paragraph of section 26.4.4 is deleted.

   The last sentence of the fifth paragraph of section 26.4.5 is
   reworded as follows:

      (...)  S/MIME or, preferably, [RFC4474] may also be used (...)

   In the third paragraph of section 27.2, the phrase "when the failure
   of the transaction results from a Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   (RFC 2327 [1]) problem" is deleted.

   In the fifth paragraph of section 20.43, "390" is replaced with
   "380", and "miscellaneous warnings" is replaced with "miscellaneous
   SIP-related warnings".
