1.  Introduction

   The mechanism to support a subscription of a continuous and
   customized stream of updates from a YANG datastore is defined in
   [RFC8639] and [RFC8641].  Requirements for Subscription to YANG
   Datastores are defined in [RFC7923]

   By streaming data from publishers to receivers, much better
   performance and fine-grained sampling can be achieved than with

   polling.  In a distributed forwarding system, the packet forwarding
   is delegated to multiple processors on line cards.  To not to
   overwhelm the route processor resources, it is not uncommon that data
   records are published directly from processors on line cards to
   target Receivers to further increase efficiency on the routing
   system.

   This documents complement the general subscription requirements
   defined in section 4.2.1 of [RFC7923] by the paragraph: A
   Subscription Service MAY support the ability to export from multiple
   software processes on a single routing system and expose the
   information which software process produced which message to maintain
   data integrity.

2.  Terminologies

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8639] and are not redefined
   here:

   Subscriber

   Publisher

   Receiver

   Subscription

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Global Subscription: the Subscription requested by the subscriber.
   It may be decomposed into multiple Component Subscriptions.

   Component Subscription: is the Subscription that defines a data
   source which is managed and controlled by a single Publisher.

   Global Capability: is the overall subscription capability that the
   group of Publishers can expose to the Subscriber.

   Component Capability: is the subscription capability that each
   Publisher can expose to the Subscriber.

   Master: is the Publisher that interacts with the Subscriber to deal
   with the Global Subscription.  It decomposes the Global Subscription
   to multiple Component Subscriptions and interacts with the Agents.

   Agent: is the Publisher that interacts with the Master to deal with
   the Component Subscription and pushing the data to the Receiver.

   Observation Domain: An Observation Domain is the largest set of
   Observation Points for which metrics can be collected by a metering
   process.  For example, a router line card may be an Observation
   Domain if it is composed of several interfaces, each of which is an
   Observation Point.  In the YANG notification messages it generates,
   the Observation Domain includes its Observation Domain ID, which is
   unique per publisher process.  That way, the collecting process can
   identify the specific Observation Domain from the publisher that
   sends the YANG notification messages.  Every Observation Point is
   associated with an Observation Domain.

   Observation Domain ID: A 32-bit identifier of the Observation Domain
   that is locally unique to the publisher process.  The publisher
   processes uses the Observation Domain ID to uniquely identify to the
   collecting process the Observation Domain that meters the metrics.
   Receivers SHOULD use the transport session and the Observation Domain
   ID field to separate different publisher streams originating from the
   same publisher.

3.  Motivation

   Lost and corrupt YANG notification messages need to be recognized at
   the receiver to ensure data integrity even when multiple publisher
   processes publishing from the same transport session.

   To preserve data integrity down to the publisher process, the
   Observation Domain ID in the transport message header of the YANG
   notification message is introduced.  In case of UDP transport, this
   is described in Section 3.2 of UDP based transport
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif].

4.  Solution Overview

   Figure 2 below shows the distributed data export framework.

   A collector usually includes two components,

   o  the Subscriber generates the subscription instructions to express
      what and how the Receiver want to receive the data;

   o  the Receiver is the target for the data publication.

   For one subscription, there can be one or more Receivers.  And the
   Subscriber does not necessarily share the same IP address as the
   Receivers.

   In this framework, the Publisher pushes data to the Receiver
   according to the subscription.  The Publisher is either in the Master

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications               May 2021


   or Agent role.  The Master knows all the capabilities that his Agents
   are able to provide and exposes the Global Capability to the
   collector.  The Subscriber maintains the Global Subscription at the
   Master and disassembles the Global Subscription to multiple Component
   Subscriptions, depending from which source data is needed.  The
   Component Subscriptions are then distributed to the corresponding
   Publisher Agents on route and processors on line cards.

   Publisher Agents collects metrics according to the Component
   Subscription, add its metadata, encapsulate and pushes data to the
   Receiver where packets are reassembled and decapsulated.

               Fig. 2 The Distributed Data Export Framework

   Master and Agents interact with each other in several ways:

   o  Agents need to register at the Master at the beginning of their
      process life-cycle

   o  Contracts are created between the Master and each Agent on the
      Component Capability, and the format for streaming data structure.

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications               May 2021


   o  The Master relays the component subscriptions to the Agents.

   o  The Agents announce the status of their Component Subscriptions to
      the Master.  The status of the overall subscription is maintained
      by the Master.  The Master is responsible for notifying the
      subscriber in case of problems with the Component Subscriptions.

   The technical mechanisms or protocols used for the coordination of
   operational information between Master and Agent is out-of-scope of
   this document.

5.  Subscription Decomposition

   The Collector can only subscribe to the Master.  This requires the
   Master to:

   1.  expose the Global Capability that can be served by multiple
       Publisher Agents;

   2.  disassemble the Global Subscription to multiple Component
       Subscriptions, and distribute them to the Publisher Agents of the
       corresponding metric sources so that they not overlap;

   3.  notify on changes when portions of a subscription moving between
       different Publisher Agents over time.

   And the Agent to:

   o  Inherit the Global Subscription properties from Publisher Master
      for its Component Subscription;

   o  share the same life-cycle as the Global Subscription;

   o  share the same Subscription ID as the Global Subscription.

6.  Publication Composition

   The Publisher Agent collects data and encapsulates the packets per
   Component Subscription.  The format and structure of the data records
   are defined by the YANG schema, so that the decomposition at the
   Receiver can benefit from the structured and hierarchical data
   records.

   The Receiver is able to associate the YANG data records with
   Subscription ID [RFC8639] to the subscribed subscription and with
   Message Observation Domain ID
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notification-messages] to one of the Publisher
   Agents software processes to enable message integrity.

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications               May 2021


   For the dynamic subscription, the output of the "establish-
   subscription" RPC defined in [RFC8639] MUST include a list of Message
   Observation Domain IDs to indicate how the Global Subscription is
   decomposed into several Component Subscriptions.

   The "subscription-started" and "subscription-modified" notification
   defined in [RFC8639] MUST also include a list of Message Observation
   Domain IDs to notify the current Publishers for the corresponding
   Global Subscription.

7.  Subscription State Change Notifications

   In addition to sending event records to Receivers, the Master MUST
   also send subscription state change notifications [RFC8639] when
   events related to subscription management have occurred.  All the
   subscription state change notifications MUST be delivered by the
   Master.

   When the subscription decomposition result changed, the
   "subscription-modified" notification MUST be sent to indicate the new
   list of Publishers.

8.  Publisher Configurations

   This document assumes that all Publisher Agents are preconfigured to
   push data.  The actual working Publisher Agents are selected based on
   the subscription decomposition result.

   All Publisher Agents share the same source IP address for data
   export.  For connectionless data transport such as UDP based
   transport [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] the same Layer 4 source port
   for data export can be used.  For connection based data transport
   such as HTTPS based transport [I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif], each
   Publisher Agent MUST be able to acknowledge packet retrieval from
   Receivers, and therefore requires a dedicated Layer 4 source port per
   software process.

   The specific configuration on transports is described in the
   resposible documents.

      Reference: RFC XXXX

12.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The new data nodes introduced in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get-config or
   notification) to this data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /subscriptions/subscription/message-observation-domain-ids

   The entries in the two lists above will show where subscribed
   resources might be located on the publishers.  Access control MUST be
   set so that only someone with proper access permissions has the
   ability to access this resource.

   Other Security Considerations is the same as those discussed in YANG-
   Push [RFC8641].

   A "establish-subscription" RPC request as per [RFC8641] is sent to
   the Master with a successful response.  An example of using NETCONF:

   As the device is able to fully satisfy the request, the request is
   given a subscription ID of 22.  The response as in Figure 5 indicates
   that the subscription is decomposed into two component subscriptions
   which will be published by two message Observation Domain ID: #1 and
   #2.

   The subscriber may invoke the "modify-subscription" RPC for a
   subscription it previously established.  The RPC has no difference to
   the single publisher case as in [RFC8641].  Figure 6 provides an
   example where a subscriber attempts to modify the period and
   datastore XPath filter of a subscription using NETCONF.

        </modify-subscription>
     </rpc>

                   Fig. 6 "modify-subscription" Request

   If the modification is successfully accepted, the "subscription-
   modified" subscription state notification is sent to the subscriber
   by the Master.  The notification, Figure 7 for example, indicates the
   modified subscription is decomposed into one component subscription
   which will be published by message Observation Domain #1.

   Before starting to push data, the "subscription-started" subscription
   state notification is sent to the Receiver.  The following example
   assumes the NETCONF transport has already established.  The
   notification indicates that the configured subscription is decomposed
   into two component subscriptions which will be published by two
   message Observation Domain: #1 and #2.
