    A YANG Data Model for Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat
                    Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel
              draft-boucadair-dots-rfc8782-yang-update-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an updated version of the Distributed Denial-
   of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel YANG data
   model.  This updated version makes use of the new mechanisms for
   defining abstract data structures with YANG as specified in RFC8791.

   This document updates RFC 8782.

1.  Introduction

   As specified in [RFC8782], messages exchanged between DOTS agents are
   serialized using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
   [RFC7252].  CBOR-encoded payloads are used to carry signal channel-
   specific payload messages which convey request parameters and
   response information such as errors.

   This document specifies a YANG module [RFC7950] for representing DOTS
   mitigation scopes, DOTS signal channel session configuration data,
   and DOTS redirected signaling.  All parameters in the payload of the
   DOTS signal channel are mapped to CBOR types as specified in Table 5
   of [RFC8782].

   This YANG module is not intended to be used via NETCONF/RESTCONF for
   DOTS server management purposes; such a module is out of the scope of
   this document.  It serves only to provide abstract data structures.
   This document uses the "structure" extension specified in [RFC8791].

   The meaning of the symbols in YANG tree diagrams is defined in
   [RFC8340] and [RFC8791].

2.  Summary of Changes From RFC8782

   The main changes compared to the YANG version published in [RFC8782]
   are as follows:

   o  Follow the new YANG data structure specified in [RFC8791].

Internet-Draft       DOTS Signal Channel YANG Module           July 2020


   o  Add in "choice" to indicate the communication direction in which a
      data node applies.  If no "choice" is indicated, a node can appear
      in both directions (i.e., from DOTS clients to DOTS servers and
      vice versa).

   o  Remove "config" clauses.  Note that "config" statements will be
      ignored (if present) anyway according to Section 4 of [RFC8791].

   o  Remove "cuid", "cdid", and "sid" nodes from the structure because
      these nodes are included as Uri-Path options, not within the
      message body.

   o  Remove the list keys for the mitigation scope message type (i.e.,
      "cuid" and "mid"). "mid" is not indicated as a key because it is
      included as Uri-Path option for requests and in the message body
      for responses.  Note that Section 4 of [RFC8791] specifies that a
      list does not require to have a key statement defined.

   These changes are made with the constraint to avoid changes to the
   mapping table defined in Table 5 of [RFC8782].  A DOTS signal channel
   attribute that may be present in both requests and responses will
   thus have the same CBOR key value and CBOR major type.

3.  Tree Structure

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-dots-signal-channel",
   which has the following tree structure.  A DOTS signal message can be
   a mitigation, a configuration, a redirect, or a heartbeat message.
   The use of these attributes is specified in [RFC8782].

   This tree structure obsoletes the one described in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC8782].

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines YANG data structures that are meant to be used
   as an abstract representation of DOTS signal channel messages.  As
   such, this document does not introduce any new vulnerabilities beyond
   those specified Section 10 of [RFC8782].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-dots-signal-channel
         Registrant Contact: The IESG.
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG modules in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

         Name: ietf-dots-signal-channel
         Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-dots-signal-channel
         Maintained by IANA: N
         Prefix: signal
         Reference: RFC XXXX

7.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Martin Bjoerklund for the suggestion to use RFC8791.

   The initial version of the DOTS signal channel YANG model was
   specified in [RFC8782] authored by Tirumaleswar Reddy.K, Mohamed
   Boucadair, Prashanth Patil, Andrew Mortensen, and Nik Teague.
