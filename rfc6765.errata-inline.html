1.  Introduction

   xDSL Multi-pair bonding allows a service provider to provide high-
   bandwidth services to business and residential customers over
   multiple xDSL lines, with greater speed and resiliency than service
   over a single xDSL line, bridging the gap between xDSL and fiber-
   based transport.

   Currently, there are three xDSL Multi-pair bonding schemes, also
   known under the collective name &quot;G.Bond&quot;:

   o  ATM-Based Multi-pair bonding, as specified in ITU-T Recommendation
      G.998.1 [G.998.1], which defines a method for the bonding (or
      aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels
      in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bidirectional logical link
      carrying an ATM stream.  This specification can be viewed as an
      evolution of the legacy Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA)
      technology [AF-PHY-0086], applied to xDSL with variable rates on
      each line/bearer channel.

   o  Ethernet-Based Multi-pair bonding, as specified in ITU-T
      Recommendation G.998.2 [G.998.2], which defines a method for the
      bonding (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual
      bearer channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single
      bidirectional logical link carrying an Ethernet stream.  This
      specification can be viewed as IEEE 802.3-2005 [802.3] Clause 61,
      Physical Medium Entity (PME) Aggregation, generalized to work over
      any xDSL technology (2Base-TL and 10Pass-TS interfaces defined by
      IEEE use G.SHDSL (Single-pair High-speed DSL) and VDSL (Very high
      speed DSL) technology, respectively).

   o  Multi-pair bonding using Time-Division Inverse Multiplexing
      (TDIM), specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3 [G.998.3], which
      defines a method for the bonding (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL
      lines into a single bidirectional logical link carrying a mix of
      various traffic streams (e.g., Ethernet, ATM, TDM).

   Architecturally, all three bonding schemes define a new &quot;bonded&quot;
   Transport Protocol Specific - Transmission Convergence (TPS-TC)
   sub-layer, stacked above multiple ATM-TC, Ethernet/Packet Transfer
   Mode-TC (PTM-TC), or Synchronous Transfer Mode-TC (STM-TC) (clear
   channel) sub-layers for the ATM, Ethernet, or TDIM bonding,
   respectively.  Each underlying TPS-TC sub-layer represents a
   protocol-specific interface to an xDSL line or an individual bearer
   channel of an xDSL line.  Bonding of multiple bearer channels in the
   same xDSL line is not allowed.

   All schemes allow bonding of up to 32 individual line/channel
   sub-layers with variable rates, providing common functionality for
   the configuration, initialization, operation, and monitoring of the
   bonded link.

   This document defines a MIB module common to all 3 schemes.
   Additional managed objects specific to each bonding technology are
   defined in the G9981-MIB [RFC6768], G9982-MIB [RFC6767], and
   G9983-MIB [RFC6766] modules.

   The textual conventions listing the bonding schemes are defined in a
   separate, IANA-maintained MIB module, the first version of which is
   provided in this document.  This arrangement would allow for future
   bonding schemes to be easily supported, without the need to update
   the common GBOND-MIB module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   &quot;Management Framework for xDSL Bonding&quot; [TR-159], defining a
   management model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded
   xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB), Inverse Stack Table MIB (IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB),
   and Interface Stack Capability MIB (IF-CAP-STACK-MIB); G.Bond scheme-
   specific modules G.Bond/ATM (G9981-MIB), G.Bond/Ethernet (G9982-MIB),
   and G.Bond/TDIM (G9983-MIB); and DSL-specific MIB modules ADSL
   (ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB), ADSL2 (ADSL2-LINE-MIB), SHDSL
   (HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB), VDSL (VDSL-LINE-MIB), and VDSL2
   (VDSL2-LINE-MIB).

4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module

   A bonded xDSL port is a stacked (a.k.a. aggregated or bonded)
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

   The stack management, i.e., actual connection of the sub-layers to
   the top layer interface, is done via the ifStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-MIB [RFC2863] and its inverse -- the ifInvStackTable, as
   defined in the IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864].

   The ifCapStackTable and its inverse -- the ifInvCapStackTable, as
   defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB [RFC5066] -- extend the stack
   management with an ability to describe possible connections or cross-
   connect capability, when a flexible cross-connect matrix is present
   between the interface layers.

4.1.1.  Layering Model

   A G.Bond interface can aggregate up to 32 channel sub-layers, with
   each channel representing an xDSL line or an xDSL bearer channel.
   For the purpose of brevity we will refer to the bonded interface as
   the Generic Bonding Sub-layer (GBS) and to the channel sub-layer as
   the Bonding Channel Entity (BCE).

   A generic G.Bond device can have a number of GBS ports, each
   connected to a particular upper layer (e.g., a Media Access Control
   (MAC) interface for the G.998.2 scheme), while simultaneously cross-
   connected to a number of underlying BCEs, with a single-GBS-per-BCE
   relationship.

   A GBS port is represented in the Interfaces table (ifTable) as a
   separate interface with an ifType reflecting a particular bonding
   scheme, e.g., g9981(263), g9982(264), or g9983(265).

   Each BCE in the aggregated GBS port is represented in the ifTable as
   a separate interface with an ifType relevant to a particular xDSL
   technology, e.g., shdsl(169) or vdsl(97).  The ifType values are
   defined in [IANAifType-MIB].

   The following figure shows the layering diagram and corresponding use
   of the ifTable for the bonded xDSL interfaces:

   .-----------------------------.  -
   |            GBS              |  ^ 1 ifEntry

   +-----------------+---+-------+  -            g9983(265), etc.

   &#x27;-----------------+---+-------&#x27;  -

    GBS    - Generic Bonding Sub-layer

    TPS-TC - Transport Protocol Specific - Transmission Convergence
    PMS-TC - Physical Media Specific - Transmission Convergence

            Figure 1: Use of ifTable for Bonded xDSL Interfaces

   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the aggregated
   G.Bond port (GBS) and the BCEs connected to it.  The ifStackTable
   allows a network management application to determine which BCEs are
   connected to a particular GBS and change connections (if supported by
   the application).  The ifInvStackTable, being an inverted version of
   the ifStackTable, provides an efficient means for a network
   management application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and
   thereby determine which GBS runs on top of a particular BCE.

   The ifCapStackTable, defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,
   specifies for each higher-layer interface (e.g., GBS port) a list of
   lower-layer interfaces (e.g., BCEs), which can possibly be cross-
   connected to that higher-layer interface, determined by the cross-
   connect capability of the device.  This table, modeled after the
   ifStackTable, is read only, reflecting current cross-connect
   capability of a stacked interface, which can be dynamic in some
   implementations (e.g., if xDSL lines are located on a pluggable
   module and the module is pulled out).  Note that BCE availability per
   GBS, described by the ifCapStackTable, can be constrained by other
   parameters -- for example, by the aggregation capacity of a GBS or by
   the BCE in question being already connected to another GBS.  So, in

   order to ensure that a particular BCE can be connected to the GBS,
   all respective parameters (e.g., ifCapStackTable, ifStackTable, and
   gBondPortCapCapacity) SHALL be inspected.

   The ifInvCapStackTable, also defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,
   describes which higher-layer interfaces (e.g., GBS ports) can
   possibly be connected to a particular lower-layer interface (e.g.,
   BCE), providing inverted mapping of the ifCapStackTable.  While it
   contains no additional information beyond that already contained in
   the ifCapStackTable, the ifInvCapStackTable has the ifIndex values in
   its INDEX clause in the reverse order, i.e., the lower-layer
   interface first, and the higher-layer interface second, providing
   efficient means for a network management application to read a subset
   of the ifCapStackTable and thereby determine which interfaces can be
   connected to run on top of a particular interface.

4.1.2.  xDSL Bonding

   The G.998.x Bonding allows a number of BCEs to be aggregated onto a
   single logical GBS port by splitting the incoming traffic into
   multiple streams, transmitting each stream over a specific BCE, and
   combining the streams at the remote GBS port, preserving the original
   traffic order.

   The Ethernet frames MAY be fragmented before the transmission and
   reassembled at the remote end to minimize transportation delay.  The
   G.998.2 (G.Bond/Ethernet) ports with multiple BCEs MUST perform the
   fragmentation and reassembly of the Ethernet frames.  However, for
   single-BCE G.998.2 ports this function MAY be omitted (a.k.a. bonding
   bypass), to minimize fragmentation overhead and additional processing
   delay as well as to be able to interoperate with non-G.998 DSL
   equipment.

   The agent is REQUIRED to indicate all supported bonding schemes (for
   example, ATM, Ethernet, and TDIM), including OPTIONAL support for the
   bonding bypass in G.998.2 single-BCE ports.

   The GBOND-MIB module allows a network management application to query
   Bonding capability and enable/disable it if supported.  Note that
   enabling Bonding (by setting the value of the
   gBondPortConfAdminScheme and gBondPortConfPeerAdminScheme objects to
   any supported bonding scheme other than &#x27;none&#x27;) effectively turns on
   the fragmentation and reassembly function, even on a single-BCE port.

4.1.3.  Discovery Operation

   The G.Bond ports may optionally support a discovery operation whereby
   BCEs, during initialization, exchange information about their
   respective aggregation groups (GBS), via the [G.994.1] handshake
   (G.hs) protocol.  This information can then be used to detect copper
   misconnections or for an automatic assignment of the local BCEs into
   aggregation groups instead of a fixed preconfiguration.

   The MIB module defined in this document allows a network management
   application to control the G.Bond discovery mechanism and query its
   results.

   Two tables are used by the G.Bond discovery mechanism: the
   ifStackTable and the ifCapStackTable.  The following pseudocode gives
   an example of the discovery and automatic BCE assignment for a
   generic multi-GBS G.Bond device, located at the Central Office (CO),
   using objects defined in this MIB module as well as the
   IF-CAP-STACK-MIB and IF-MIB modules [Note that automatic BCE
   assignment is only shown here for the purposes of the example.  Fixed
   BCE pre-assignment, manual assignment, or auto-assignment using an
   alternative internal algorithm may be chosen by a particular
   implementation]:

   // Go over all GBS ports in the CO device
   FOREACH gbs[i] IN CO_device
   { // Perform discovery and auto-assignment on GBS ports
     // with room for more channels.
     IF ( gbs[i].NumBCEs &lt; gbs[i].BondCapacity )
     { // Assign a unique 6-octet local discovery code to the GBS,
       // e.g., MAC address of the associated port or some other
       // unique number specifically allocated for this purpose.
       dc = gbs[i].DiscoveryCode = MAC[i];
       // Go over all disconnected channels, which can
       // potentially be connected to the GBS.
       FOREACH bce[j] IN ifCapStackTable[gbs[i]] AND
                      NOT IN ifStackTable[gbs[i]]  // not connected
       { // Try to grab the Remote Terminal device (RT) by writing the
         // value of the local 6-byte discovery code to the remote
         // discovery code register (via a handshake mechanism).
         // This operation is an atomic Set-if-Clear action; i.e., it
         // would succeed only if the remote discovery register was
         // zero.  Read the remote discovery code register via a Get
         // operation to see if the RT, attached via the BCE,
         // is indeed marked as being the CO_device peer.
         bce[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode = dc;          // Set-if-Clear
         r = bce[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode;           // Get

         IF ( r == dc AND gbs[i].NumBCEs &lt; gbs[i].BondCapacity )
         { // RT connected via BCE[j] is/was a peer
           // for GBS[i], and there is room for another BCE in the
           // GBS[i] aggregation group (max. Bonding capacity is
           // not reached yet).
           // Connect this BCE to the GBS (via the ifStackTable; the
           // ifInvStackTable, which is the inverse of the ifStackTable,
           // is updated automatically; i.e., gbs[i] is auto-added
           // to ifInvStackTable[bce[j]]).
           ADD bce[j] TO ifStackTable[gbs[i]];
           gbs[i].NumBCEs = gbs[i].NumBCEs + 1;
           // Discover all other disconnected BCEs
           // attached to the same RT and connect them to
           // the GBS, provided there is enough room for more BCEs.
           FOREACH bce[k] IN ifCapStackTable[gbs[i]] and
                          NOT IN ifStackTable[gbs[i]]
           { // Get the remote discovery code from the BCE to see if
             // it belongs to a connected RT &quot;grabbed&quot; by
             // the CO_device.
             r = bce[k].RemoteDiscoveryCode;
             IF ( r == dc AND gbs[i].NumBCEs &lt; gbs[i].BondCapacity )
             { // Physically connect the BCE to the GBS.
               // (gbs[i] is auto-added TO ifInvStackTable[bce[k]]).
               ADD bce[k] TO ifStackTable[gbs[i]];
               gbs[i].NumBCEs = gbs[i].NumBCEs + 1;
             }
           }
         }
         // At this point we have discovered all local BCEs that
         // are physically connected to the same RT and
         // connected them to GBS[i].  Go to the next GBS.
         BREAK;
       }
     }
   }

   An SNMP agent for a G.Bond device builds the ifCapStackTable and its
   inverse -- the ifInvCapStackTable -- on device initialization,
   according to the cross-connect capabilities of the device.

   Adding a BCE to the ifStackTable row for a specific GBS involves
   actual connection of the BCE to the GBS.

   Note that a GBS port does not have to be operationally &#x27;down&#x27; for the
   connection to succeed.  In fact, a dynamic BCE addition (and removal)
   MAY be implemented with an available BCE being initialized first (by
   setting its ifAdminStatus to &#x27;up&#x27;) and then added to an operationally
   &#x27;up&#x27; GBS port, by modifying a respective ifStackTable (and respective
   ifInvStackTable) entry.

   It is RECOMMENDED that removal of the last operationally &#x27;up&#x27; BCE
   from an operationally &#x27;up&#x27; GBS, i.e., modification of a respective
   entry in the ifStackTable, and a corresponding entry in the
   ifInvStackTable, would be rejected by the implementation (in the case
   of SNMP, with the error inconsistentValue), as this action would
   completely drop the link.

   In addition to the standard handshake-based discovery described
   above, [G.998.2] defines an optional frame-based discovery and pair
   management.  These frame-based methods are discussed in [RFC6767].

4.1.4.  Initialization of G.Bond Ports

   G.Bond ports built on top of xDSL technology require a lengthy
   initialization or &#x27;training&#x27; process before any data can pass.
   During this initialization, both ends of a link (peers) work
   cooperatively to achieve a required data rate on a particular copper
   pair.  Sometimes, when the copper line is too long or the noise on
   the line is too high, that &#x27;training&#x27; process may fail to achieve a
   specific target rate with required characteristics.

   The ifAdminStatus object from the IF-MIB controls the desired state
   of a GBS with all the BCEs connected to it or of an individual BCE
   port.  Setting this object to &#x27;up&#x27; instructs a particular GBS or a
   BCE to start the initialization process, which may take tens of
   seconds for G.Bond ports.  The ifOperStatus object from the IF-MIB
   shows the operational state of an interface for the GBS, extended by
   the gBondPortStatFltStatus object defined in this document, and a
   corresponding *Status object from a relevant xDSL line MIB for BCE
   interfaces.

   A disconnected BCE may be initialized by changing the ifAdminStatus
   from &#x27;down&#x27; to &#x27;up&#x27;.  Changing the ifAdminStatus to &#x27;up&#x27; on the GBS
   initializes all BCEs connected to that particular GBS.  Note that in
   the case of bonding, some interfaces may fail to initialize while
   others succeed.  The GBS is considered operationally &#x27;up&#x27; if at least
   one bonded BCE is operationally &#x27;up&#x27;.  When all BCEs connected to the
   GBS are &#x27;down&#x27;, the GBS SHALL be considered operationally
   &#x27;lowerLayerDown&#x27;.  The GBS SHALL be considered operationally

   &#x27;notPresent&#x27; if it is not connected to any BCE.  The GBS/BCE
   interface SHALL remain operationally &#x27;down&#x27; during initialization,
   indicated by the &#x27;init&#x27; value of the gBondPortStatFltStatus object.

4.1.5.  Usage of the ifTable

   Both BCE and GBS interfaces are managed using interface-specific
   management objects defined in the GBOND-MIB module and generic
   interface objects from the ifTable of the IF-MIB, with all management
   table entries referenced by the interface index ifIndex.

   The following table summarizes G.Bond-specific interpretations for
   some of the ifTable objects specified by the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup:

   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | IF-MIB Object | G.Bond Interpretation                             |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | ifIndex       | Interface index.  Note that each BCE and each GBS |
   |               | in the G.Bond PHY MUST have a unique index, as    |
   |               | there are some GBS- and BCE-specific attributes   |
   |               | accessible only on the GBS or BCE level.          |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | ifType        | g9981(263), g9982(264), or g9983(265) for the     |
   |               | ATM, Ethernet, or TDIM GBS, respectively;         |
   |               | shdsl(169) for the G.SHDSL BCE, vdsl(97) for the  |
   |               | VDSL BCE, etc.                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | ifSpeed       | Operating data rate for the BCE.  For the GBS, it |
   |               | is the sum of the current operating data rates of |
   |               | all BCEs in the aggregation group, without the    |
   |               | encapsulation overhead and G.Bond overhead, but   |
   |               | accounting for Inter-Frame Gaps (IFG).  When a    |
   |               | GBS or a BCE is operating in an asymmetrical      |
   |               | fashion (the upstream data rate differs from the  |
   |               | downstream one), the lowest of the values is      |
   |               | shown.                                            |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | ifAdminStatus | Setting this object to &#x27;up&#x27; instructs a           |
   |               | particular GBS (with all BCEs connected to it) or |
   |               | a BCE to start the initialization process.        |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | ifOperStatus  | A relevant *Status object from a particular line  |
   |               | MIB supplements the value of ifOperStatus for     |
   |               | BCEs.  gBondPortStatFltStatus supplements the     |
   |               | value of ifOperStatus for a GBS.  Note that both  |
   |               | relevant objects shall be inspected to determine  |
   |               | the real operational status of a BCE/GBS port,    |
   |               | e.g., a GBS port may be operationally &#x27;up&#x27; with   |
   |               | gBondPortStatFltStatus indicating lowRate(4)      |
   |               | fault condition, or &#x27;down&#x27; with no gBond faults.  |

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond ATM, ETH, and TDIM MIB Modules

   The MIB module defined in this document is common to all G.998
   bonding schemes.  It MUST be used in conjunction with a bonding
   scheme-specific MIB module:

   o  G9981-MIB [RFC6768] for a G.998.1 bonded interface.

   o  G9982-MIB [RFC6767] for a G.998.2 bonded interface.

   o  G9983-MIB [RFC6766] for a G.998.3 bonded interface.

4.3.  Relationship to xDSL MIB Modules

   Each xDSL technology is described in a relevant xDSL line MIB module:
   e.g., the HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB [RFC4319] for G.SHDSL,
   ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB [RFC3440] for ADSL, ADSL2-LINE-MIB [RFC4706] for
   ADSL2, VDSL-LINE-MIB [RFC3728] for VDSL, or VDSL2-LINE-MIB [RFC5650]
   for VDSL2.

   These MIB modules are used to manage individual xDSL lines/channels
   (BCEs).

4.4.  Addition of New Bonding Schemes

   In case a new bonding scheme is introduced in a revision of G.998,
   IANA can update the IANA-maintained MIB module, adding the
   corresponding new value to the IANAgBondScheme and
   IANAgBondSchemeList textual conventions, as well as listing the new
   scheme-specific MIB module&#x27;s name (e.g., G998x-MIB).

   Any scheme-specific aspect of an existing GBOND-MIB object SHALL be
   described in the corresponding G998x-MIB module, to prevent an
   unnecessary reissue of the GBOND-MIB module.  For example, an exact
   definition of an Errored Second (ES) or a Severely Errored Second
   (SES) can be bonding-scheme specific; see the definitions for the
   gBondPortPmCurES and gBondPortPmCurSES objects.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   The main management objects defined in the GBOND-MIB module are split
   into 2 groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:

   o  gBondPort - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status, historical Performance Monitoring, and notifications,
      common to all G.Bond ports (GBS).

   o  gBondBce - containing a single common object for configuration of
      the remote discovery code per BCE.  Note that the rest of the
      objects for BCE configuration, capabilities, status, and
      notifications are located in relevant xDSL line MIB modules as
      well as in the bonding scheme-specific MIB modules.

5.2.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history
   buckets (interval-counters) defined in [TR-159] are implemented using
   the textual conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705].
   The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of the textual
   conventions found in the PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen-
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each
   one-day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   The rationale behind this is to simplify collection and analysis of
   Performance Monitoring (PM) from multiple agents by a network
   management system (NMS) -- each PM interval can be &quot;time-stamped&quot;
   using the gBond*IntervalIndex object, from the fact that the 1-day
   interval starts at 00:00 and the 15-minute intervals are aligned with
   each 1/4 hour and the network-wide &quot;wall clock&quot;, typically
   distributed via NTP or the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)
   [RFC5905].  If the agent does not have access to the wall clock, a
   local clock can be used.  In this case, as well as when coping with
   multiple time zones, the NMS would have to correlate the difference
   between the agent&#x27;s local clock (available, for example, via the
   hrSystemDate object from the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB [RFC2790]) and the
   wall clock.

   Counters are not reset when a GBS is re-initialized, but rather only
   when the agent is reset or re-initialized.

   Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a
   monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of
   service unavailability on that monitored entity.  The DESCRIPTION
   clause of Performance Monitoring counters in this MIB module
   specifies which of the counters are inhibited during periods of
   service unavailability.

5.3.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and managed objects defined in this

    DESCRIPTION
      &quot;The objects in this MIB module are used to manage the
      multi-pair bonded xDSL interfaces, as defined in ITU-T
      Recommendations G.998.1, G.998.2, and G.998.3.

      This MIB module MUST be used in conjunction with a bonding
      scheme-specific MIB module, that is, G9981-MIB, G9982-MIB,
      or G9983-MIB.

      The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

      [G.998.1] refers to:
        ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: &#x27;ATM-based multi-pair bonding&#x27;,
        January 2005.

      [G.998.2] refers to:
        ITU-T Recommendation G.998.2: &#x27;Ethernet-based multi-pair
        bonding&#x27;, January 2005.

      [G.998.3] refers to:
        ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3: &#x27;Multi-pair bonding using
        time-division inverse multiplexing&#x27;, January 2005.

      [TR-159] refers to:
        Broadband Forum Technical Report: &#x27;Management Framework for
        xDSL Bonding&#x27;, December 2008.

     DESCRIPTION
       &quot;This textual convention defines a range of values that may be
       set in a fault threshold alarm control for a 1-day Performance
       Monitoring interval.
       As the number of seconds in a 1-day interval numbers at most
       86400, objects of this type may have a range of 0...86400,
       where the value of 0 disables the alarm.&quot;

     }
     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION
       &quot;This notification indicates that the G.Bond port&#x27;s upstream
       data rate has reached/dropped below or exceeded the low
       upstream rate threshold, specified by
       gBondPortConfThreshLowUpRate.

       This notification MAY be sent for the -O subtype ports
       while the port is &#x27;up&#x27;, on the crossing event in both
       directions: from normal (rate is above the threshold) to low
       (rate equals the threshold or is below it) and from low to
       normal.  This notification is not applicable to the -R
       subtypes.

       It is RECOMMENDED that a small debouncing period of 2.5 sec,
       between the detection of the condition and notification,
       be implemented to prevent simultaneous LinkUp/LinkDown and
       gBondLowUpRateCrossing notifications from being sent.

       The adaptive nature of the G.Bond technology allows the port
       to adapt itself to the changes in the copper environment;
       e.g., an impulse noise, alien crosstalk, or a
       micro-interruption may temporarily drop one or more BCEs in
       the aggregation group, causing a rate degradation of the
       aggregated G.Bond link.  The dropped BCEs would then try to
       re-initialize, possibly at a lower rate than before, adjusting
       the rate to provide the required target SNR margin.

       Generation of this notification is controlled by the
       gBondPortConfLowRateCrossingEnable object.

       This object maps to the TR-159 notification
       nGroupLowUpRateCrossing.&quot;

     DESCRIPTION
       &quot;A desired G.Bond port data rate in the upstream direction,
       in Kbps, to be achieved during initialization, under
       restrictions placed upon the member BCEs by their respective
       configuration settings.
       This object represents a sum of individual BCE upstream data
       rates, modified to compensate for fragmentation and
       encapsulation overhead (e.g., for an Ethernet service, the
       target data rate of 10 Mbps SHALL allow lossless transmission
       of full-duplex 10-Mbps Ethernet frame stream with minimal
       inter-frame gap).
       Note that the target upstream data rate may not be achieved
       during initialization (e.g., due to unavailability of required
       BCEs) or the initial bandwidth could deteriorate, so that the
       actual upstream data rate (gBondPortStatUpDataRate) could be less
       than gBondPortConfTargetUpDataRate.

       The value is limited above by 10 Gbps, to accommodate very
       high speed bonded xDSL interfaces (e.g., 32 x 100 Mbps).

       The value between 1 and 10000000 indicates that the total
       upstream data rate of the G.Bond port after initialization
       SHALL be equal to the target data rate or less, if the target

       specified by this object, the excess capability SHALL be
       either converted to an additional SNR margin or reclaimed by
       minimizing transmit power.

       The value of 0 means that the target data rate is not

       initialization (best effort), under specified spectral
       restrictions and with a desired SNR margin per BCE.

     DESCRIPTION
       &quot;A desired G.Bond port data rate in the downstream direction,
       in Kbps, to be achieved during initialization, under
       restrictions placed upon the member BCEs by their respective
       configuration settings.
       This object represents a sum of individual BCE downstream data
       rates, modified to compensate for fragmentation and
       encapsulation overhead (e.g., for an Ethernet service, the
       target data rate of 10 Mbps SHALL allow lossless transmission
       of full-duplex 10-Mbps Ethernet frame stream with minimal
       inter-frame gap).
       Note that the target downstream data rate may not be achieved
       during initialization (e.g., due to unavailability of required
       BCEs) or the initial bandwidth could deteriorate, so that the
       actual downstream data rate (gBondPortStatDnDataRate) could be
       less than gBondPortConfTargetDnDataRate.

       The value is limited above by 10 Gbps, to accommodate very
       high speed bonded xDSL interfaces (e.g., 32 x 100 Mbps).

       The value between 1 and 10000000 indicates that the total
       downstream data rate of the G.Bond port after initialization
       SHALL be equal to the target data rate or less, if the target
       downstream data rate cannot be achieved under the restrictions
       configured for BCEs.  In cases where the copper environment

       An Unavailable Second for a G.998.x interface is defined as a
       count of 1-second intervals during which the bonded link is
       unavailable.  The G.998.x link becomes unavailable at the onset
       of 10 contiguous SESs.  The 10 SESs are included in the
       unavailable time.  Once unavailable, the G.998.x line becomes
       available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs.

    DESCRIPTION
      &quot;This MIB module defines IANAgBondScheme and IANAgBondSchemeList
      TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, specifying enumerated values of the
      gBondPortConfAdminScheme, gBondPortConfPeerAdminScheme,
      gBondPortStatOperScheme, gBondPortStatPeerOperScheme,
      gBondPortCapSchemesSupported, and gBondPortCapPeerSchemesSupported
      objects, respectively, as defined in the GBOND-MIB.

      It is intended that each new bonding scheme defined by the
      ITU-T Q4/SG15 working group and approved for publication in a
      revision of the ITU-T G.998 specification will be added to this
      MIB module, provided that it is suitable for being managed by the
      base objects in the GBOND-MIB.  An Expert Review, as defined in
      RFC 5226, is REQUIRED for such additions.

      The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

      [G.998.1] refers to:
        ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: &#x27;ATM-based multi-pair bonding&#x27;,
        January 2005.

       &quot;This textual convention defines a bitmap of possible ITU-T
       G.998 (G.Bond) bonding schemes.  Currently, the following values
       are defined for the corresponding bonding schemes:

         g9983(3) - G.998.3 (G.Bond/TDIM; see the G9983-MIB)
       An additional value of none(0) can be returned as a result
       of a GET operation when a value of the object cannot be
       determined (for example, a peer GBS cannot be reached), the port
       does not support any kind of bonding, or when a single-BCE
       G.998.2 GBS supports bonding (frame fragmentation/reassembly)
       bypass.&quot;

<b>Notes:</b><br/>

</div>
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Changing of the gBondPortConfAdminScheme object may lead to a
      potential locking of the link, if the peer device does not support
      the desired bonding scheme.

   o  Changing of the gBondPortConfDiscoveryCode object, before the
      discovery operation, may lead to a wrongful discovery -- for
      example, when two CO ports are connected to the same multi-channel
      RT port, while both CO ports have the same discovery register
      value.

   o  Changing of the target upstream/downstream data rate via
      gBondPortConfTargetUpDataRate/gBondPortConfTargetDnDataRate may
      lead to anything from degradation of link quality and data rate to
      a complete link initialization failure, as the ability of a G.Bond
      port to support a particular configuration depends on the copper
      environment.

   o  Activation of a specific line/channel may cause a severe
      degradation of service for another G.Bond port, whose channel(s)
      may be affected by the cross-talk from the newly activated
      channel.

   o  Removal of a channel from an operationally &#x27;up&#x27; G.Bond port,
      aggregating several channels, may cause degradation of the port&#x27;s
      data rate.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they
   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and
   can reveal some aspects of their configuration.

   In particular, since a bonded xDSL port can be comprised of multiple
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice-grade copper, located in the same
   bundle with other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is
   theoretically possible to eavesdrop on a G.Bond transmission, simply
   by &quot;listening&quot; to cross-talk from the bonded pairs, especially if the
   operating parameters of the G.Bond link in question are known.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the
   tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  gBondPortStatTable - objects in this table provide status
      information for the G.Bond port, which may aid in identification
      of the pairs belonging to the bonded port and eavesdropping on the
      traffic over that port.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for

   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Three new values of IANAifType -- g9981(263), g9982(264), and
   g9983(265) -- have been allocated by IANA &lt;http://www.iana.org/&gt; in
   the IANAifType-MIB module [IANAifType-MIB].

   An object identifier for gBondMIB MODULE-IDENTITY has been allocated
   by IANA in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree (211).

   This document defines the first version of the IANA-maintained IANA-
   GBOND-TC-MIB module.  It is intended that each new G.998 bonding
   scheme defined by the ITU-T Q4/SG15 working group and approved for
   publication in a revision of ITU-T G.998.x will be added to the IANA-
   maintained MIB module, provided that it is suitable for being managed
   by the base objects in the GBOND-MIB module.  An object identifier
   for ianaGBondTcMIB MODULE-IDENTITY has been allocated by IANA in the
   MIB-2 transmission sub-tree (215).

   For each new bonding scheme added, a short description of the bonding
   protocol and, wherever possible, a reference to a publicly available
   specification SHOULD be specified.  An Expert Review, as defined in
   [RFC5226], is REQUIRED for each modification.
