 Abstract 
    
   iSCSI [RFC3720] is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI 
   family of protocols onto TCP/IP.  This document defines an 
   additional iSCSI node name type format to enable use of the 
   "Network Address Authority" (NAA) world wide naming format 
   defined by ANSI T11 Fibre Channel (FC) protocols and used by SAS. 
   This document updates RFC 3720.

1. Introduction 
    
   This document discusses the motivation for adding an NAA type 
   format as an iSCSI node name format and defines this format in 
   accordance with the iSCSI naming conventions [RFC3720]. Defining 
   this format will enable storage devices containing both iSCSI 
   ports and SAS ports to use the same NAA-based SCSI device name. 
 
    
2. Background 
    
   To date, there are a number of networked transports providing 
   port abstractions to the SCSI protocol.  These transports all 
   incorporate some form of world-wide unique name construction 
   format.  The following table summarizes the current protocols and 
   their name formats.

                       iSCSI NAA Naming Format              June 2004 
 
 
          SCSI transport protocol      Name Format    
       ----------------------------------------------- 
      |                            | EUI-64| NAA |IQN | 
      |----------------------------|-------|-----|----| 
      |    iSCSI (Internet SCSI)   |   X   |     | X  | 
      |----------------------------|-------|-----|----| 
      |     FCP (Fibre Channel)    |       |  X  |    | 
      |----------------------------|-------|-----|----| 
      | SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) |       |  X  |    | 
      |----------------------------|-------|-----|----| 
      |    SRP (for InfiniBand)    |   X   |     |    | 
       ----------------------------------------------- 
    
    
   The NAA format is used by the Fibre Channel and SAS protocols.  
   This makes the NAA format the most commonly used identifier 
   format for SCSI transports. 
    
   Although one of the T11-defined NAA formats contains a mapping of 
   EUI-64 numbers, it requires some mathematical manipulation to 
   extract the EUI-64 identifier out of this format and the NAA  
   EUI-64 mapping reserves 2 bits in the EUI-64 identifier, thereby 
   reducing the EUI-64 namespace.   
      
3. Motivation 
    
   If iSCSI included a naming format that allowed direct 
   representation of an NAA-format name, it would facilitate 
   construction of a target device name that translates easily 
   across multiple namespaces for a storage device containing ports 
   served by different transports. 
    
   This document defines an NAA type iSCSI naming format. One NAA 
   identifier can be assigned as the basis for the SCSI device name 
   for a target having SAS SCSI ports and iSCSI SCSI ports. 
    
   T10 has defined a string format SCSI target device name in [SPC3] 
   that is reported in the VPD page 83 device identifier page.  
   [SAM3] specifies that a SCSI device shall have no more than one 
   (i.e., zero or one) SCSI device name in the SCSI name string 
   format regardless of the number of SCSI transport protocols 
   supported by the SCSI device. Addition of the ANSI T11-defined 
   NAA format as an defined type for iSCSI device names would make 
   the iSCSI device naming format more consistent across all current 
   SCSI networked transports which define an NAA format SCSI device 
   name, facilitating the creation of SCSI device names that are 
   transport-independent.  This would also contribute to the 
   creation of LU names based on this SCSI device name.

                       iSCSI NAA Naming Format              June 2004 
 
 
   The T11 NAA formatted as an ASCII-hexadecimal representation has 
   a maximum size of 32 characters (128 bit formats) - as a result 
   there is no issue with this name format exceeding the maximum 
   size for iSCSI node names. 
    
4. iSCSI Name Structure  
    
   This document defines an additional iSCSI name type: 
    
     type "naa." - the remainder of the string is an ANSI T11 
                  defined Network Address Authority identifier in 
                  ASCII-encoded hexadecimal.  
    
4.1 Type "naa." - Network Address Authority 
    
   The ANSI T11 FC-FS specification defines a format for 
   constructing globally unique identifiers [FC-FS] referred to as a 
   Network Address Authority (NAA) format.  
   The iSCSI name format is "naa." followed by an NAA identifier 
   (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal digits). 
    
      Example iSCSI name with a 64-bit NAA value:  

         Type  NAA identifier (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal) 
         +--++--------------+  
         |  ||              |  

         naa.52004567BA64678D  

      Example iSCSI name with a 128-bit NAA value:  

         Type  NAA identifier (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal) 
         +--++------------------------------+  
         |  ||                              |  

         naa.62004567BA64678D0123456789ABCDEF  

   The NAA iSCSI name format might be used in an implementation 
   where the structure for generating FC NAA worldwide unique names 
   is already in place because the device contains both Fibre 
   Channel and iSCSI SCSI ports. 
    
5. Terminology 
5.1 IQN 
   iSCSI qualified name, an identifier format defined by the iSCSI 
   protocol [RFC3720].

5.2 SRP 
   SCSI RDMA Protocol.  SRP defines a SCSI protocol mapping onto the 
   InfiniBand (tm) Architecture and/or functionally similar cluster 
   protocols [SRP]. 
    
5.3 SAS 
   Serial Attached SCSI. The Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) standard 
   contains both a physical Layer that is compatible with Serial ATA 
   and protocols for transporting SCSI commands to SAS devices and 
   for transporting ATA commands to SATA devices [SAS]. 
    
5.4 NAA 
   Network Address Authority - a naming format defined by the ANSI 
   T11 Fibre Channel protocols [FC-FS]. 
    
5.5 InfiniBand 
   An I/O architecture intended to replace PCI and address high 
   performance server interconnect [IB]. 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   This iSCSI name format does not introduce any new security 
   concerns for the iSCSI protocol beyond the other iSCSI naming 
   formats.  Please refer to RFC 3720, section 8 for information on 
   the security considerations for the iSCSI protocol. 
    
7. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document has no actions for IANA.
