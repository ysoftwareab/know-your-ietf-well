1. Introduction

   The Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is an essential component of
   Traffic Engineered (TE) systems that are based on MPLS-TE [RFC2702]
   and GMPLS [RFC3945]. The TED is a collection of all TE information
   about all TE nodes and TE links in the network. The TE Topology is a
   schematic arrangement of TE nodes and TE links present in a given
   TED. There could be one or more TE Topologies present in a given
   Traffic Engineered system. A TE Topology is the topology on which
   path computational algorithms are run to compute Traffic Engineered
   Paths (TE Paths).

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for representing
   and manipulating TE Topologies. This model contains technology

   agnostic TE Topology building blocks that can be augmented and used
   by other technology-specific TE Topology models.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with general body of work
   captured in currently available TE related RFCs. [RFC7926] serves as
   a good starting point for those who may be less familiar with Traffic
   Engineering related RFCs.

   Some of the key terms used in this document are:

   TED: The Traffic Engineering Database is a collection of all TE
   information about all TE nodes and TE links in a given network.

   TE-Topology: The TE Topology is a schematic arrangement of TE nodes
   and TE links in a given TED. It forms the basis for a graph suitable
   for TE path computations.

   Native TE Topology: Native TE Topology is a topology that is native
   to a given provider network. Native TE topology could be discovered
   via various routing protocols and/or subscribe/publish techniques.
   This is the topology on which path computational algorithms are run
   to compute TE Paths.

   Customized TE Topology: Customized TE Topology is a custom topology
   that is produced by a provider for a given client. This topology
   typically makes abstractions on the provider's Native TE Topology,
   and is provided to the client. The client receives the Customized TE
   Topology, and merges it into the client's Native TE Topology. The
   client's path computational algorithms aren't typically run on the
   Customized TE Topology; they are run on the client's Native TE
   Topology after the merge.

1.2. Tree Structure

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in Appendix A. of this document. The tree format defined in [RFC8340]
   is used for the YANG data model tree representation.

2. Characterizing TE Topologies

   The data model proposed by this document takes the following
   characteristics of TE Topologies into account:

   - TE Topology is an abstract control-plane representation of the
     data-plane topology. Hence attributes specific to the data-plane
     must make their way into the corresponding TE Topology modeling.
     The TE Topology comprises of dynamic auto-discovered data as well
     as fairly static data associated with data-plane nodes and links.
     The dynamic data may change frequently, such as unreserved
     bandwidth available on data-plane links. The static data rarely
     changes, such as layer network identification, switching and
     adaptation capabilities and limitations, fate sharing, and
     administrative colors. It is possible for a single TE Topology to
     encompass TE information at multiple switching layers.

   - TE Topologies are protocol independent. Information about
     topological elements may be learnt via link-state protocols, but
     the topology can exist without being dependent on any particular
     protocol.

   - TE Topology may not be congruent to the routing topology in a
     given TE System. The routing topology is constructed based on
     routing adjacencies. There isn't always a one-to-one association
     between a TE-link and a routing adjacency. For example, the
     presence of a TE link between a pair of nodes doesn't necessarily
     imply the existence of a routing-adjacency between these nodes. To

     learn more, see [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling] and
     [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-l3-te-topo].

   - Each TE Topological element has at least one information source
     associated with it. In some scenarios, there could be more than
     one information source associated with any given topological
     element.

   - TE Topologies can be hierarchical. Each node and link of a given
     TE Topology can be associated with respective underlay topology.
     This means that each node and link of a given TE Topology can be
     associated with an independent stack of supporting TE Topologies.

   - TE Topologies can be customized. TE topologies of a given network
     presented by the network provider to its client could be
     customized on per-client request basis. This customization could
     be performed by provider, by client or by provider/client
     negotiation. The relationship between a customized topology and
     provider's native topology could be captured as hierarchical
     (overlay-underlay), but otherwise the two topologies are decoupled
     from each other. A customized topology is presented to the client,
     while provider's native topology is known in its entirety to the
     provider itself.

3.1. TE Topology

   TE topology is a traffic engineering representation of one or more
   layers of network topologies. TE topology is comprised of TE nodes
   (TE graph vertices) interconnected via TE links (TE graph edges). A
   TE topology is mapped to a TE graph.

3.2. TE Node

   TE node is an element of a TE topology, presented as a vertex on TE
   graph. TE node represents one or several nodes, or a fraction of a
   node, which can be a switch or router that is physical or virtual. TE
   node belongs to and is fully defined in exactly one TE topology. TE
   node is assigned a unique ID within the TE topology scope. TE node
   attributes include information related to the data plane aspects of

Internet-Draft            YANG - TE Topology                  June 2019


   the associated node(s) (e.g. connectivity matrix), as well as
   configuration data (such as TE node name). A given TE node can be
   reached on the TE graph over one of TE links terminated by the TE
   node.

   Multi-layer TE nodes providing switching functions at multiple
   network layers are an example where a physical node can be decomposed
   into multiple logical TE nodes, which are fractions of the physical
   node. Some of these (logical) TE nodes may reside in the client layer
   TE topology while the remaining TE nodes belong to the server layer
   TE topology.

   In Figure 1, Node-1, Node-2, and Node-3 are TE nodes.

3.3. TE Link

   TE link is an element of a TE topology, presented as an edge on TE
   graph. The arrows on an edge indicate one or both directions of the
   TE link. When there are a pair of parallel links of opposite
   directions, an edge without arrows is also used. TE link represents
   one or several (physical) links or a fraction of a link.  TE link
   belongs to and is fully defined in exactly one TE topology. TE link
   is assigned a unique ID within the TE topology scope. TE link
   attributes include parameters related to the data plane aspects of
   the associated link(s) (e.g. unreserved bandwidth, resource
   maps/pools, etc.), as well as the configuration data (such as remote
   node/link IDs, SRLGs, administrative colors, etc.). TE link is
   connected to TE node, terminating the TE link via exactly one TE link
   termination point (LTP).

   In Figure 1, Link-12 and Link-23 are TE links.

3.4. Transitional TE Link for Multi-Layer Topologies

   Networks are typically composed of multiple network layers where one
   or multiple signals in the client layer network can be multiplexed
   and encapsulated into a server layer signal [RFC5212] [G.805]. The
   server layer signal can be carried in the server layer network across
   multiple nodes until the server layer signal is terminated and the
   client layer signals reappear in the node that terminates the server
   layer signal. Examples of multi-layer networks are: IP over MPLS over
   Ethernet, low order Optical Data Unit-k (ODUk) signals multiplexed
   into a high order ODUl (l>k) carried over an Optical Channel (OCh)
   signal in an optical transport network as defined in [G.872] and
   [G.709].

   TE links as defined in Section 3.3. can be used to represent links
   within a network layer. In case of a multi-layer network, TE nodes
   and TE links only allow representation of each network layer as a
   separate TE topology. Each of these single layer TE topologies would
   be isolated from their client and their server layer TE topology, if
   present. The highest and the lowest network layer in the hierarchy
   only have a single adjacent layer below or above, respectively.
   Multiplexing of client layer signals and encapsulating them into a
   server layer signal requires a function that is provided inside a
   node (typically realized in hardware). This function is also called
   layer transition.

   One of the key requirements for path computation is to be able to
   calculate a path between two endpoints across a multi-layer network
   based on the TE topology representing this multi-layer network. This
   means that an additional TE construct is needed that represents
   potential layer transitions in the multi-layer TE-topology that
   connects the TE-topologies representing each separate network layer.
   The so-called transitional TE link is such a construct and it
   represents the layer transition function residing inside a node that
   is decomposed into multiple logical nodes that are represented as TE
   nodes (see also the transitional link definition in [G.8080] for the
   optical transport network). Hence, a transitional TE link connects a
   client layer node with a server layer node. A TE link as defined in
   3.3. has LTPs of exactly the same kind on each link end whereas the
   transitional TE link has client layer LTPs on the client side of the
   transitional link and in most cases a single server layer LTP on the
   server side. It should be noted that transitional links are a helper
   construct in the multi-layer TE topology and they only exist as long
   as they are not in use, as they represent potential connectivity.
   When the server layer trail has been established between the server
   layer LTP of two transitional links in the server layer network, the
   resulting client layer link in the data plane will be represented as
   a normal TE link in the client layer topology. The transitional TE
   links will re-appear when the server layer trail has been torn down.

3.5. TE Link Termination Point (LTP)

   TE link termination point (LTP) is a conceptual point of connection
   of a TE node to one of the TE links, terminated by the TE node.
   Cardinality between an LTP and the associated TE link is 1:0..1.

   In Figure 1, Node-2 has six LTPs: LTP-1 to LTP-6.

3.6. TE Tunnel Termination Point (TTP)

   TE tunnel termination point (TTP) is an element of TE topology
   representing one or several of potential transport service
   termination points (i.e. service client adaptation points such as

   WDM/OCh transponder). TTP is associated with (hosted by) exactly one
   TE node. TTP is assigned a unique ID within the TE node scope.
   Depending on the TE node's internal constraints, a given TTP hosted
   by the TE node could be accessed via one, several or all TE links
   terminated by the TE node.

   In Figure 1, Node-1 has two TTPs: TTP-1 and TTP-2.

3.7. TE Node Connectivity Matrix

   TE node connectivity matrix is a TE node's attribute describing the
   TE node's switching limitations in a form of valid switching
   combinations of the TE node's LTPs (see below). From the point of
   view of a potential TE path arriving at the TE node at a given
   inbound LTP, the node's connectivity matrix describes valid
   (permissible) outbound LTPs for the TE path to leave the TE node
   from.

   In Figure 1, the connectivity matrix on Node-2 is:
   {<LTP-6, LTP-1>, <LTP-5, LTP-2>, <LTP-5, LTP-4>, <LTP-4, LTP-1>,
   <LTP-3, LTP-2>}

3.8. TTP Local Link Connectivity List (LLCL)

   TTP Local Link Connectivity List (LLCL) is a List of TE links
   terminated by the TTP hosting TE node (i.e. list of the TE link
   LTPs), which the TTP could be connected to. From the point of view of
   a potential TE path, LLCL provides a list of valid TE links the TE
   path needs to start/stop on for the connection, taking the TE path,
   to be successfully terminated on the TTP in question.

   In Figure 1, the LLCL on Node-1 is:
   {<TTP-1, LTP-5>, <TTP-1, LTP-2>, <TTP-2, LTP-3>, <TTP-2, LTP4>}

3.9. TE Path

   TE path is an ordered list of TE links and/or TE nodes on the TE
   topology graph, inter-connecting a pair of TTPs to be taken by a
   potential connection. TE paths, for example, could be a product of
   successful path computation performed for a given transport service.

   In Figure 1, the TE Path for TE-Tunnel-1 is:
   {Node-1:TTP-1, Link-12, Node-2, Link-23, Node-3:TTP1}

3.10. TE Inter-Layer Lock

   TE inter-layer lock is a modeling concept describing client-server
   layer adaptation relationships and hence important for the multi-
   layer traffic engineering. It is an association of M client layer
   LTPs and N server layer TTPs, within which data arriving at any of
   the client layer LTPs could be adopted onto any of the server layer
   TTPs. TE inter-layer lock is identified by inter-layer lock ID, which
   is unique across all TE topologies provided by the same provider. The
   client layer LTPs and the server layer TTPs associated within a given
   TE inter-layer lock are annotated with the same inter-layer lock ID
   attribute.

             Figure 3: TE Inter-Layer Lock ID Associations

   On the picture above a TE inter-layer lock with IL_1 ID associates 6
   client layer LTPs (C-LTP-1 - C-LTP-6) with two server layer TTPs (S-
   TTP-1 and S-TTP-2). They all have the same attribute - TE inter-layer
   lock ID:  IL-1, which is the only thing that indicates the
   association. A given LTP may have 0, 1 or more inter-layer lock IDs.
   In the latter case this means that the data arriving at the LTP may
   be adopted onto any of TTPs associated with all specified inter-layer
   locks. For example, C-LTP-1 could have two inter-layer lock IDs - IL-
   1 and IL-2. This would mean that C-LTP-1 for adaptation purposes
   could use not just TTPs associated with inter-layer lock IL-1 (i.e.


Liu, et al            Expires December 19, 2019               [Page 12]

   S-TTP-1 and S-TTP-2 on the picture), but any of TTPs associated with
   inter-layer lock IL-2 as well. Likewise, a given TTP may have one or
   more inter-layer lock IDs, meaning that it can offer the adaptation
   service to any of client layer LTPs with inter-layer lock ID matching
   one of its own. Additionally, each TTP has an attribute - Unreserved
   Adaptation Bandwidth, which announces its remaining adaptation
   resources sharable between all potential client LTPs.

   LTPs and TTPs associated within the same TE inter-layer lock may be
   hosted by the same (hybrid, multi-layer) TE node or multiple TE nodes
   located in the same or separate TE topologies. The latter is
   especially important since TE topologies of different layer networks
   could be modeled by separate augmentations of the basic (common to
   all layers) TE topology model.

3.11. Underlay TE topology

   Underlay TE topology is a TE topology that serves as a base for
   constructing of overlay TE topologies

3.12. Overlay TE topology

   Overlay TE topology is a TE topology constructed based on one or more
   underlay TE topologies. Each TE node of the overlay TE topology
   represents an arbitrary segment of an underlay TE topology; each TE
   link of the overlay TE topology represents an arbitrary TE path in
   one of the underlay TE topologies. The overlay TE topology and the
   supporting underlay TE topologies may represent distinct layer
   networks (e.g. OTN/ODUk and WDM/OCh respectively) or the same layer
   network.

3.13. Abstract TE topology

   Abstract TE topology is a topology that contains abstract topological
   elements (nodes, links, tunnel termination points). Abstract TE
   topology is an overlay TE topology created by a topology provider and
   customized for a topology provider's client based on one or more of
   the provider's native TE topologies (underlay TE topologies), the
   provider's policies and the client's preferences. For example, a
   first level topology provider (such as Domain Controller) can create
   an abstract TE topology for its client (e.g. Multi-Domain Service
   Coordinator) based on the provider's one or more native TE
   topologies, local policies/profiles and the client's TE topology
   configuration requests

   Figure 4 shows an example of abstract TE topology.

   Consider the network topology depicted in Figure 7. This is a typical
   packet optical transport deployment scenario where the WDM layer
   network domain serves as a Server Network Domain providing transport
   connectivity to the packet layer network Domain (Client Network
   Domain). Nodes R1, R2, R3 and R4 are IP routers that are connected to
   an Optical WDM transport network. A, B, C, D, E and F are WDM nodes
   that constitute the Server Network Domain.

         Figure 8b: Customized TE Topology provided to the Client

   The goal here is to augment the Client TE Topology with a customized
   TE Topology provided by the WDM network. Given the availability of
   the paths A-E, B-F and B-E (Figure 8a), a customized TE Topology as
   depicted in Figure 8b is provided to the Client. This customized TE
   Topology is merged with the Client's Native TE Topology and the
   resulting topology is depicted in Figure 8c.

   The data model proposed in this document can be used to
   retrieve/represent/manipulate the customized TE Topology depicted in
   Figure 8b.

   A customized TE topology is not necessarily an abstract TE topology.
   The provider may produce, for example, an abstract TE topology of
   certain type (e.g. single-abstract-node-with-connectivity-matrix
   topology, a border-nodes-connected-via-mesh-of-abstract-links
   topology, etc.) and expose it to all/some clients in expectation that
   the clients will use it without customization.
   On the other hand, a client may request a customized version of the
   provider's native TE topology (e.g. by requesting removal of TE links


Liu, et al            Expires December 19, 2019               [Page 18]

   which belong to certain layers, are too slow, not protected and/or
   have a certain affinity). Note that the resulting TE topology will
   not be abstract (because it will not contain abstract elements), but
   customized (modified upon client's instructions).

   The client ID field in the TE topology identifier (Section 5.4. )
   indicates which client the TE topology is customized for. Although an
   authorized client MAY receive a TE topology with the client ID field
   matching some other client, the client can customize only TE
   topologies with the client ID field either 0 or matching the ID of
   the client in question. If the client starts reconfiguration of a
   topology its client ID will be automatically set in the topology ID
   field for all future configurations and updates wrt. the topology in
   question.

   The provider MAY tell the client that a given TE topology cannot be
   re-negotiated, by setting its own (provider's) ID in the client ID
   field of the topology ID.

   Even though this data model allows to access TE topology information
   across clients, implementations MAY restrict access for particular
   clients to particular data fields. The Network Configuration Access
   Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides such a mechanism.

4.3. Merging TE Topologies Provided by Multiple Providers

   A client may receive TE topologies provided by multiple providers,
   each of which managing a separate domain of multi-domain network. In
   order to make use of said topologies, the client is expected to merge
   the provided TE topologies into one or more client's native TE
   topologies, each of which homogeneously representing the multi-domain
   network. This makes it possible for the client to select end-to-end
   TE paths for its services traversing multiple domains.

   In particular, the process of merging TE topologies includes:

   - Identifying neighboring domains and locking their topologies
     horizontally by connecting their inter-domain open-ended TE links;
   - Renaming TE node, link, and SRLG IDs to ones allocated from a
     separate name space; this is necessary because all TE topologies
     are considered to be, generally speaking, independent with a
     possibility of clashes among TE node, link or SRLG IDs;
   - Locking, vertically, TE topologies associated with different layer
     networks, according to provided topology inter-layer locks; this is
     to facilitate inter-layer path computations across multiple TE
     topologies provided by the same topology provider.

         Figure 9: Merging Domain TE Topologies

   Figure 9 illustrates the process of merging, by the client, of TE
   topologies provided by the client's providers. In the Figure, each of
   the two providers caters to the client (abstract or native) TE
   topology, describing the network domain under the respective
   provider's control. The client, by consulting the attributes of the
   inter-domain TE links - such as inter-domain plug IDs or remote TE
   node/link IDs (as defined by the TE Topology model) - is able to
   determine that:

   a) the two domains are adjacent and are inter-connected via three
     inter-domain TE links, and;



Liu, et al            Expires December 19, 2019               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft            YANG - TE Topology                  June 2019


   b) each domain is connected to a separate customer site, connecting
     the left domain in the Figure to customer devices C-11 and C-12,
     and the right domain to customer devices C-21, C-22 and C-23.

   Therefore, the client inter-connects the open-ended TE links, as
   shown on the upper part of the Figure.

   As mentioned, one way to inter-connect the open-ended inter-domain TE
   links of neighboring domains is to mandate the providers to specify
   remote nodeID/linkID attribute in the provided inter-domain TE links.
   This, however, may prove to be not flexible. For example, the
   providers may not know the respective remote nodeIDs/ linkIDs. More
   importantly, this option does not allow for the client to mix-n-match
   multiple (more than one) topologies catered by the same providers
   (see below). Another, more flexible, option to resolve the open-ended
   inter-domain TE links is by annotating them with the inter-domain
   plug ID attribute. Inter-domain plug ID is a network-wide unique
   number that identifies on the network a connectivity supporting a
   given inter-domain TE link. Instead of specifying remote node ID/link
   ID, an inter-domain TE link may provide a non-zero inter-domain plug
   ID. It is expected that two neighboring domain TE topologies
   (provided by separate providers) will have each at least one open-
   ended inter-domain TE link with an inter-domain plug ID matching to
   one provided by its neighbor. For example, the inter-domain TE link
   originating from node S15 of the Domain 1 TE topology (Figure 9) and
   the inter-domain TE link coming from node S23 of Domain 2 TE topology
   may specify matching inter-domain plug ID (e.g. 175344). This allows
   for the client to identify adjacent nodes in the separate neighboring
   TE topologies and resolve the inter-domain TE links connecting them
   regardless of their respective nodeIDs/linkIDs (which, as mentioned,
   could be allocated from independent name spaces). Inter-domain plug
   IDs may be assigned and managed by a central network authority.
   Alternatively, inter-domain plug IDs could be dynamically auto-
   discovered (e.g. via LMP protocol).

   Furthermore, the client renames the TE nodes, links and SRLGs offered
   in the abstract TE topologies by assigning to them IDs allocated from
   a separate name space managed by the client. Such renaming is
   necessary, because the two abstract TE topologies may have their own
   name spaces, generally speaking, independent one from another; hence,
   ID overlaps/clashes are possible. For example, both TE topologies
   have TE nodes named S7, which, after renaming, appear in the merged
   TE topology as S17 and S27, respectively.

   Once the merging process is complete, the client can use the merged
   TE topology for path computations across both domains, for example,
   to compute a TE path connecting C-11 to C-23.

         Figure 10: Merging Domain TE Topologies

   Based on local configuration, templates and/or policies pushed by the
   client, a given provider may expose more than one abstract TE
   topology to the client. For example, one abstract TE topology could
   be optimized based on a lowest-cost criterion, while another one
   could be based on best possible delay metrics, while yet another one
   could be based on maximum bandwidth availability for the client
   services. Furthermore, the client may request all or some providers
   to expose additional abstract TE topologies, possibly of a different
   type and/or optimized differently, as compared to already-provided TE
   topologies. In any case, the client should be prepared for a provider
   to offer to the client more than one abstract TE topology.


   It should be up to the client (based on the client's local
   configuration and/or policies conveyed to the client by the client's

   clients) to decide how to mix-and-match multiple abstract TE
   topologies provided by each or some of the providers, as well as how
   to merge them into the client's native TE topologies. The client also
   decides how many such merged TE topologies it needs to produce and
   maintain. For example, in addition to the merged TE topology depicted
   in the upper part of Figure 9, the client may merge the abstract TE
   topologies received from the two providers, as shown in Figure 10,
   into the client's additional native TE topologies, as shown in Figure
   11.

   Note that allowing for the client mix-n-matching of multiple TE
   topologies assumes that inter-domain plug IDs (rather than remote
   nodeID/linkID) option is used for identifying neighboring domains and
   inter-domain TE link resolution.

     Figure 11: Multiple Native (Merged) Client's TE Topologies

   It is important to note that each of the three native (merged) TE
   topologies could be used by the client for computing TE paths for any
   of the multi-domain services. The choice as to which topology to use
   for a given service depends on the service parameters/requirements
   and the topology's style, optimization criteria and the level of
   details.

5. Modeling Considerations

5.1. Network topology building blocks

   The network topology building blocks are discussed in [RFC8345]. The
   TE Topology model proposed in this document augments and uses the
   ietf-network-topology module defined in [RFC8345].

   The TE Topology model proposed in this document is meant to be
   network technology agnostic. Other technology specific TE Topology
   models can augment and use the building blocks provided by the
   proposed model.

5.4. Topology Identifiers

   The TE-Topology is uniquely identified by a key that has 3
   constituents - topology-id, provider-id and client-id. The
   combination of provider-id and topology-id uniquely identifies a
   native TE Topology on a given provider. The client-id is used only
   when Customized TE Topologies come into play; a value of "0" is used
   as the client-id for native TE Topologies.

   ref]
           +--rw node-ref         inet:uri
           +--rw tunnel-tp-ref    binary

   The attributes directly under container connectivity-matrices are the
   default attributes for all connectivity-matrix entries when the per
   entry corresponding attribute is not specified. When a per entry
   attribute is specified, it overrides the corresponding attribute
   directly under the container connectivity-matrices. The same rule
   applies to the attributes directly under container local-link-
   connectivities.

   Each TTP (Tunnel Termination Point) MAY be supported by one or more
   supporting TTPs. If the TE node hosting the TTP in question refers to
   a supporting TE node, then the supporting TTPs are hosted by the
   supporting TE node. If the TE node refers to an underlay TE topology,
   the supporting TTPs are hosted by one or more specified TE nodes of
   the underlay TE topology.

5.7. TED Information Sources

   The model allows each TE topological element to have multiple TE
   information sources (OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE, BGP-LS, User-Configured,
   System-Processed, Other). Each information source is associated with
   a credibility preference to indicate precedence. In scenarios where a
   customized TE Topology is merged into a Client's native TE Topology,
   the merged topological elements would point to the corresponding
   customized TE Topology as its information source.

5.8. Overlay/Underlay Relationship

   The model captures overlay and underlay relationship for TE
   nodes/links. For example - in networks where multiple TE Topologies
   are built hierarchically, this model allows the user to start from a
   specific topological element in the top most topology and traverse
   all the way down to the supporting topological elements in the bottom
   most topology.

   This relationship is captured via the "underlay-topology" field for
   the node and via the "underlay" field for the link. The use of these

   fields is optional and this functionality is tagged as a "feature"
   ("te-topology-hierarchy").

         |  |  |  ....................

5.9. Templates

   The data model provides the users with the ability to define
   templates and apply them to link and node configurations. The use of
   "template" configuration is optional and this functionality is tagged
   as a "feature" ("template").

   augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
      +--rw te-node-id?   te-types:te-node-id
      +--rw te!
         +--rw te-node-template*
         |       -> ../../../../te/templates/node-template/name
         |       {template}?

   augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
      +--rw te!
         +--rw te-link-template*
         |       -> ../../../../te/templates/link-template/name
         |       {template}?

   augment /nw:networks:
      +--rw te!
         +--rw templates
            +--rw node-template* [name] {template}?
            |  +--rw name
            |  |       te-types:te-template-name
            |  +--rw priority?                  uint16
            |  +--rw reference-change-policy?   enumeration
            |  +--rw te-node-attributes
               ..........
            +--rw link-template* [name] {template}?
               +--rw name
               |       te-types:te-template-name
               +--rw priority?                  uint16
               +--rw reference-change-policy?   enumeration
               +--rw te-link-attributes
               ..........

   Multiple templates can be specified to a configuration element. When
   two or more templates specify values for the same configuration
   field, the value from the template with the highest priority is used.
   The range of the priority is from 0 to 65535, with a lower number
   indicating a higher priority. The reference-change-policy specifies
   the action that needs to be taken when the template changes on a
   configuration element that has a reference to this template. The
   choices of action include taking no action, rejecting the change to
   the template and applying the change to the corresponding
   configuration.

5.10. Scheduling Parameters

   The model allows time scheduling parameters to be specified for each
   topological element or for the topology as a whole. These parameters
   allow the provider to present different topological views to the
   client at different time slots. The use of "scheduling parameters" is
   optional.

   The YANG data model for configuration scheduling is defined in
   [I-D.liu-netmod-yang-schedule], which allows specifying configuration
   schedules without altering this data model.

5.11. Notifications

   Notifications are a key component of any topology data model.

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] and
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] define a subscription and push mechanism
   for YANG datastores. This mechanism currently allows the user to:

   - Subscribe notifications on a per client basis
   - Specify subtree filters or xpath filters so that only interested
     contents will be sent.
   - Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

6. Guidance for Writing Technology Specific TE Topology Augmentations

   The TE topology model defined in this document is technology agnostic
   as it defines concepts, abstractions and attributes that are common
   across multiple network technologies. It is envisioned that this base
   model will be widely used when defining technology specific TE
   topology models for various layer networks.
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-yang], [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang], and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-l3-te-topo] are some examples of technology
   specific TE Topology models. Writers of such models are encouraged to
   augment the basic TE topology model's containers, such as TE
   Topology, TE Node, TE Link, Link Termination Point (LTP), Tunnel
   Termination Point (TTP), Bandwidth and Label with the layer specific
   attributes instead of defining new containers.

   Consider the following technology specific example-topology model:

   module: example-topology
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types/tet:te-topology:
       +--rw example-topology!
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/tet:te:

8. Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040]. The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242]. The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default). These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to
   these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types/tet:te-topology
      This subtree specifies the TE topology type. Modifying the
      configurations can make TE topology type invalid. By such
      modifications, a malicious attacker may disable the TE
      capabilities on the related networks and cause traffic disrupted
      or misrouted.

   o  /nw:networks/tet:te
      This subtree specifies the TE node templates and TE link
      templates. Modifying the configurations in this subtree will
      change the related future TE configurations. By such
      modifications, a malicious attacker may change the TE capabilities
      scheduled at a future time, to cause traffic disrupted or
      misrouted.

Internet-Draft            YANG - TE Topology                  June 2019


   o  /nw:networks/nw:network
      This subtree specifies the topology-wide configurations, including
      the TE topology ID and topology-wide policies. Modifying the
      configurations in this subtree can add, remove, or modify TE
      topologies. By adding a TE topology, a malicious attacker may
      create an unauthorized traffic network. By removing or modifying a
      TE topology, a malicious attacker may cause traffic disabled or
      misrouted in the specified TE topology. Such traffic changes may
      also affect the traffic in the connected TE topologies.

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node
      This subtree specifies the configurations for TE nodes. Modifying
      the configurations in this subtree can add, remove, or modify TE
      nodes. By adding a TE node, a malicious attacker may create an
      unauthorized traffic path. By removing or modifying a TE node, a
      malicious attacker may cause traffic disabled or misrouted in the
      specified TE node. Such traffic changes may also affect the
      traffic on the surrounding TE nodes and TE links in this TE
      topology and the connected TE topologies.

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link/tet:te
      This subtree specifies the configurations for TE links. Modifying
      the configurations in this subtree can add, remove, or modify TE
      links. By adding a TE link, a malicious attacker may create an
      unauthorized traffic path. By removing or modifying a TE link, a
      malicious attacker may cause traffic disabled or misrouted on the
      specified TE link. Such traffic changes may also affect the
      traffic on the surrounding TE nodes and TE links in this TE
      topology and the connected TE topologies.

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point
      This subtree specifies the configurations of TE link termination
      points. Modifying the configurations in this subtree can add,
      remove, or modify TE link termination points. By adding a TE link
      termination point, a malicious attacker may create an unauthorized
      traffic path. By removing or modifying a TE link termination
      point, a malicious attacker may cause traffic disabled or
      misrouted on the specified TE link termination point. Such traffic
      changes may also affect the traffic on the surrounding TE nodes
      and TE links in this TE topology and the connected TE topologies.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      configurations, including the TE topology ID, the topology-wide
      policies, and the topology geolocation.

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node
      Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the operational
      state information of TE nodes.

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link/tet:te
      Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the operational
      state information of TE links.

Appendix B. Companion YANG Model for Non-NMDA Compliant Implementations

   The YANG module ietf-te-topology defined in this document is designed
   to be used in conjunction with implementations that support the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in
   [RFC8342]. In order to allow implementations to use the model even in
   cases when NMDA is not supported, the following companion module
   ietf-te-topology-state is defined as a state model, which mirrors the
   module ietf-te-topology defined earlier in this document. However,
   all data nodes in the companion module are non-configurable, to
   represent the applied configuration or the derived operational
   states.

   The companion module, ietf-te-topology-state, is redundant and SHOULD
   NOT be supported by implementations that support NMDA.

   As the structure of the module ietf-te-topology-state mirrors that of
   the module ietf-te-topology. The YANG tree of the module ietf-te-
   topology-state is not depicted separately.

B.1. TE Topology State YANG Module

   te-types].
