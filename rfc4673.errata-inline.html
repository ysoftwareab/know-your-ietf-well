1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It is becoming increasingly important to support Dynamic
   Authorization extensions on the network access server (NAS) devices
   to handle the Disconnect and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) messages
   as described in [RFC3576].  As a result, the effective management of
   RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entities is of considerable importance.
   This RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS) MIB complements the
   managed objects used for managing RADIUS authentication and
   accounting clients as described in [RFC4668] and [RFC4670],
   respectively.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS)

   The component that resides on the NAS that processes the Disconnect
   and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) Request packets [RFC3576] sent by
   the Dynamic Authorization Client.

   Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)

   The component that sends Disconnect and CoA-Request packets to the
   Dynamic Authorization Server.  Although this component often resides
   on the RADIUS server, it is also possible for it to be located on a
   separate host, such as a Rating Engine.

   Dynamic Authorization Server Port

   The UDP port on which the Dynamic Authorization Server listens for
   the Disconnect and CoA requests sent by the Dynamic Authorization
   Client.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base, or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   &quot;Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS&quot; [RFC3576] defines the
   operation of Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK,
   CoA-Request, CoA-ACK, and CoA-NAK packets.  Typically, NAS devices
   implement the DAS function, and thus would be expected to implement
   the RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Server MIB, whereas DACs implement
   the client function and thus would be expected to implement the
   RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB.

   However, it is possible for a RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entity to
   perform both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS
   proxy may act as a DAS to one or more DACs while simultaneously
   acting as a DAC to one or more DASs.  In such situations, it is
   expected that RADIUS entities combining client and server
   functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.

   This memo describes the MIB for Dynamic Authorization Servers and
   relates to the following documents as follows:

   [RFC4668] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Auth Client MIB.

   [RFC4669] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Auth Server MIB.

   [RFC4670] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Acct Client MIB.

   [RFC4671] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Acct Server MIB.

   [RFC4672] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Dynamic Auth Client.

   A NAS typically implements the MIBs for a RADIUS Authentication
   Client, a RADIUS accounting client, and a RADIUS Dynamic
   Authorization Server.  However, any one MIB can be implemented
   without implementing any of the other MIBs; i.e., the MIBs have no
   dependencies on each other.  A typical case would be for a device to
   implement the MIBs RADIUS authentication server, RADIUS accounting
   server, and RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client.  A RADIUS proxy
   might implement any, all, or a subset of the MIBs listed above and
   the MIB as defined in this document.

                 Figure 1.  Mapping of clients and servers

   This MIB module for the Dynamic Authorization Server contains the
   following:

   1.  Three scalar objects.

   2.  One Dynamic Authorization Client Table.  This table contains one
       row for each DAC with which the DAS shares a secret.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   radiusDynAuthClientAddress and radiusDynAuthClientAddressType

      These can be used to determine the address of the DAC with which
      the DAS is communicating.  This information could be useful in
      mounting an attack on the DAC.

   radiusDynAuthServerIdentifier

      This can be used to determine the Identifier of the DAS.  This
      information could be useful in impersonating the DAS.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   The IANA has assigned OID number 146 under mib-2.

<b>Section:</b> 99

<b>Original Text:</b>

severe MIB module structural problem
-- issue instantiated similarly in both RFC 4672 and 4673

Let&#x27;s start with RFC 4672 and the RADIUS-DYNAUTH-CLIENT-MIB module.

On page 5 of RFC 4672, two module-global scalar objects are specified;
the DESCRIPTION clause of the
radiusDynAuthClientDisconInvalidServerAddresses OBJECT-TYPE says:

                                           [...].  This counter may
                 experience a discontinuity when the DAC module
                 (re)starts, as indicated by the value of
                 radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity.&quot;

and the literally same sentence appears again in the DESCRIPTION
clause of the radiusDynAuthClientCoAInvalidServerAddresses OBJECT-TYPE.

This would make sense iff radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity
would have been defined as another module-global scalar MIB object.
But unfortunately, radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity is a
tabular row object in the radiusDynAuthServerTable, with separate
instances for every radiusDynAuthServerIndex instantiated there.
So, which object instance should be taken for reference ???
Moreover, should ever the radiusDynAuthServerTable be empty,
no such CounterDiscontinuity objects would be instantiated,
invalidating the semantical integrity of the MIB module.

Thus, let&#x27;s take a closer look at the DESCRIPTION clause of the
radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity OBJECT-TYPE, on page 17
of the RFC:

          DESCRIPTION
                &quot;The time (in hundredths of a second) since the
                 last counter discontinuity.  A discontinuity may
                 be the result of a reinitialization of the DAC
                 module within the managed entity.&quot;

It remains unclear which scope was intended, i.e. whether &quot;the last
counter discontinuity&quot; was meant to just cover the counters within
the same conceptual row of the table, of it was meant to cover all
the counter objects in the MIB module.
If the former interpretation is to be accepted, the references
to this object from the scalar objects&#x27; DESCRIPTIONS quoted above
would be severely ambiguous.
In case of the latter interpretation, the semantics of this object
indeed do not depend in any way on the conceptual row, i.e. the
related radiusDynAuthServerIndex instance; but if an object of
the same semantics appears in every table row instantiated, all
of its instances must have the same value at any point in time.
Hence, the object with that semantics should have been modeled
as a module-global scalar object, and not as a tabular object !!!

IMHO, such a single, module-global scalar object would perhaps be
sufficient for the desired purpose.

In a similar way, the module-global scalar counters in the
RADIUS-DYNAUTH-SERVER-MIB module,
radiusDynAuthServerDisconInvalidClientAddresses and
adiusDynAuthServerCoAInvalidClientAddresses,
as specified on page 6 of RFC 4673, refer to the object,
radiusDynAuthServerCounterDiscontinuity,
which turns out to be a tabular row object in the
radiusDynAuthClientTable, not another scalar object,
thus leading to the same kind of ambiguity.

Taken altogether, the specifications are ambigous and will certainly
lead to interoperability problems.

I strongly propose to revise these MIB module specifications as
soon as possible.

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

None
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
from pending<br/><br/>--VERIFIER COMMENT--<br/>seems to be correct. The scalars do not have a discontinuity object.<br/>That sentence should be removed or either an object has to be added. It<br/>seems that the other mibs like RFC4668 also does not have such an object<br/>for the scalars while it has a discontinuity timer for the objects in<br/>the table... It should be for all or for none I would think.
