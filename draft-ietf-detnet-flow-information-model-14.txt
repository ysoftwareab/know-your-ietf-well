1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability to carry
   specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
   with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
   delivery latency.  A description of the general background and
   concepts of DetNet can be found in [RFC8655].

   This document describes the Detnet Flow and Service Information
   Model.  For reference [RFC3444] describes the rationale behind
   Information Models in general.  This document describes the Flow and
   Service information models for operators and users to understand
   Detnet services, and for implementors as a guide to the functionality
   required by Detnet services.

   The DetNet Architecture treats the DetNet related data plane
   functions decomposed into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a
   forwarding sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide
   DetNet service protection and reordering.  The forwarding sub-layer
   provides resource allocation (to ensure low loss, assured latency,
   and limited out-of-order delivery) and leverages Traffic Engineering
   mechanisms.

   DetNet service utilizes IP or MPLS and DetNet is currently defined
   for IP and MPLS networks as shown in Figure 1 based on Figure 2 and
   Figure 3 of [RFC8938].  IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN)
   utilizes Ethernet and is defined over Ethernet networks.  A DetNet
   flow includes one or more App-flow(s) as payload.  App-flows can be
   Ethernet, MPLS, or IP flows, which impacts which header fields are
   utilized to identify a flow.  DetNet flows are identified by the

   DetNet encapsulation of App-flow(s) (e.g., MPLS labels, IP 6-tuple
   etc.).  In some scenarios App-flow and DetNet flow look similar on
   the wire (e.g., L3 App-flow over a DetNet IP network).

       Figure 1: DetNet Service Examples as per Data Plane Framework

   As shown in Figure 1 as per [RFC8938] a DetNet flow can be treated as
   an application level flow (App-flow) e.g., at DetNet flow aggregation
   or in a sub-network that interconnects DetNet nodes.

   The DetNet flow and service information model provided by this
   document contains both DetNet flow and App-flow specific information
   in an integrated fashion.

   In a given network scenario three information models can be
   distinguished:

   o  Flow models that describe characteristics of data flows.  These
      models describe in detail all relevant aspects of a flow that are
      needed to support the flow properly by the network between the
      source and the destination(s).

   o  Service models that describe characteristics of services being
      provided for data flows over a network.  These models can be
      treated as a network operator independent information model.

   o  Configuration models that describe in detail the settings required
      on network nodes to provide a data flow proper service.

   Service and flow information models are used between the user and the
   network operator.  Configuration information models are used between
   the management/control plane entity of the network and the network
   nodes.  They are shown in Figure 2.

         Figure 2: Usage of Information models (flow, service and
                              configuration)

   DetNet flow and service information model is based on [RFC8655] and
   on the concept of data model specified by [IEEE8021Qcc].  In addition
   to the TSN data model, [IEEE8021Qcc] also specifies configuration of
   TSN features (e.g., traffic scheduling specified by [IEEE8021Qbv]).
   The common architecture and flow model, allow configured features to
   be consistent in certain deployment scenarios, e.g., when the network
   that provides the DetNet service includes both L3 and L2 network
   segments.

1.1.  Goals

   As expressed in the [IETFDetNet] Charter, the DetNet WG collaborates
   with IEEE 802.1 TSN in order to define a common architecture for both
   Layer 2 and Layer 3.  This is beneficial for several reasons, e.g.,
   in order to simplify implementations and maintain consistency across
   diverse networks.  The flow and service information models are also
   aligned for those reasons.  Therefore, the DetNet flow and service
   information models described in this document are based on
   [IEEE8021Qcc], which is an amendment to [IEEE8021Q].

   This document specifies flow and service information models only.

1.2.  Non Goals

   This document does not specify flow data models or DetNet
   configuration.  Therefore, the goals of this document differ from the
   goals of [IEEE8021Qcc], which also specifies the TSN data model and
   configuration of certain TSN features.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Terms Used in This Document

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   architecture [RFC8655] and the DetNet Data Plane Framework [RFC8938].
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with these documents and any

   [RFC8655] is used to perform translation from [IEEE8021Qcc] to this
   document.

   The following terminology is used in accordance with [RFC8655]:

   App-flow      The payload (data) carried over a DetNet service.

   DetNet flow   A DetNet flow is a sequence of packets which conform
                 uniquely to a flow identifier, and to which the DetNet
                 service is to be provided.  It includes any DetNet

   o  Composed names use capital letters for the first letter of each
      component.  All other letters are lowercase, even for acronyms.
      Exceptions are made for acronyms containing a mixture of lowercase
      and capital letters, such as IPv6.  Example composed names are
      SourceMacAddress and DestinationIPv6Address.

3.  DetNet Domain and its Modeling

3.1.  DetNet Service Overview

   The DetNet service can be defined as a service that provides a
   capability to carry a unicast or a multicast data flow for an
   application with constrained requirements on network performance,
   e.g., low packet loss rate and/or latency.

   Figure 5 and Figure 8 in [RFC8655] show the DetNet service related
   reference points and main components.

3.2.  Reference Points Used in Modeling

   From service design perspective a fundamental question is the
   location of the service/flow endpoints, i.e., where the service/flow
   starts and ends.

   App-flow specific reference points are the Source (where it starts)
   and the Destination (where it terminates).  Similarly a DetNet flow
   has reference points termed DN Ingress (where a DetNet flow starts)
   and DN Egress (where a DetNet flow ends).  These reference points may
   coexist in the same node (e.g., in a DetNet IP end system).  DN
   Ingress and DN Egress reference points are intermediate reference
   points for a served App-flow.

   All reference points are assumed in this document to be packet-based
   reference points.  A DN Ingress may add and a DN Egress may remove

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


   networking technology specific encapsulation to/from the served App-
   flow(s) (e.g., MPLS label(s), UDP and IP headers).

3.3.  Information Elements

   The DetNet flow information model and the service model relies on
   three groups of information elements:

   o  App-flow related parameters: these describe the App-flow
      characteristics (e.g., identification, encapsulation, traffic
      specification, endpoints, status, etc.) and the App-flow service
      expectations (e.g., delay, loss, etc.).

   o  DetNet flow related parameters: these describe the DetNet flow
      characteristics (e.g., identification, format, traffic
      specification, endpoints, rank, etc.).

   o  DetNet service related parameters: these describe the expected
      service characteristics (e.g., delivery type, connectivity delay/
      loss, status, rank, etc.).

   In the information model a DetNet flow contains one or more
   (aggregated) App-flows (N:1 mapping).  During DetNet aggregation the
   aggregated DetNet flows are treated simply as App-flows and the
   aggregate is the DetNet flow, which provides N:1 mapping.  Similarly,
   there is an aggregated many to one relationship for the DetNet
   flow(s) to the DetNet Service.

4.  App-flow Related Parameters

   When Deterministic service is required by time/loss sensitive
   application(s) running on an end system during communication with its
   peer(s), the resulting data exchange has various requirements on
   delay and/or loss parameters.

4.1.  App-flow Characteristics

   App-flow characteristics are described by the following parameters:

   o  FlowID: a unique (management) identifier of the App-flow.  It can
      be used to define the N:1 mapping of App-flows to a DetNet flow.

   o  FlowType: set by the encapsulation format of the flow.  It can be
      Ethernet (TSN), MPLS, or IP.

   o  DataFlowSpecification: a flow descriptor, defining which packets
      belongs to a flow, using specific packet header fields such as
      src-addr, dst-addr, label, VLAN-ID, etc.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


   o  TrafficSpecification: a flow descriptor, defining traffic
      parameters such as packet size, transmission time interval, and
      maximum packets per time interval.

   o  FlowEndpoints: delineate the start and termination reference
      points of the App-flow by pointing to the source interface/node
      and destination interface(s)/node(s).

   o  FlowStatus: indicates the status of the App-flow with respect to
      the establishment of the flow by the connected network, e.g.,
      ready, failed, etc.

   o  FlowRank: indicates the rank of this flow relative to other flows
      in the connected network.

   Note: When defining the N:1 mapping of App-flows to a DetNet flow,
   the App-flows must have the same FlowType and different
   DataFlowSpecification parameters

4.2.  App-flow Requirements

   App-flow requirements are described by the following parameters:

   o  FlowRequirements: defines the attributes of the App-flow regarding
      bandwidth, latency, latency variation, loss, and misordering
      tolerance.

   o  FlowBiDir: defines the data path requirement of the App-flow
      whether it must share the same data path and physical path for
      both directions through the network, e.g., to provide congruent
      paths in the two directions.

5.  DetNet Flow Related Parameters

   The Data model specified by [IEEE8021Qcc] describes data flows using
   TSN service as periodic flows with fixed packet size (i.e., Constant
   Bit Rate (CBR) flows) or with variable packet size.  The same concept
   is applied for flows using DetNet service.

   Latency and loss parameters are correlated because the effect of late
   delivery can result in data loss for an application.  However, not
   all applications require hard limits on both latency and loss.  For
   example, some real-time applications allow graceful degradation if
   loss happens (e.g., sample-based data processing, media
   distribution).  Some other applications may require high-bandwidth
   connections that make use of packet replication techniques which are
   economically challenging or even impossible.  Some applications may
   not tolerate loss, but are not delay sensitive (e.g., bufferless

   sensors).  Time or loss sensitive applications may have somewhat
   special requirements especially for loss (e.g., no loss over two
   consecutive communication cycles; very low outage time, etc.).

   DetNet flows have the following attributes:

   a.  DnFlowID (Section 5.1)
   b.  DnPayloadType (Section 5.2)
   c.  DnFlowFormat (Section 5.3)
   d.  DnFlowSpecification (Section 5.4)
   e.  DnTrafficSpecification (Section 5.5)
   f.  DnFlowEndpoints (Section 5.6)
   g.  DnFlowRank (Section 5.7)
   h.  DnFlowStatus (Section 5.8)

   DetNet flows have the following requirement attributes:

   o  DnFlowRequirements (Section 5.9)
   o  DnFlowBiDir (Section 5.10)

   Flow attributes are described in the following sections.

5.1.  Management ID of the DetNet Flow

   A unique (management) identifier is needed for each DetNet flow
   within the DetNet domain.  It is specified by DnFlowID.  It can be
   used to define the N:1 mapping of DetNet flows to a DetNet service.

5.2.  Payload type of the DetNet Flow

   The DnPayloadType attribute is set according to the encapsulated App-
   flow format.  The attribute can be Ethernet, MPLS, or IP.

5.3.  Format of the DetNet Flow

   The DnFlowFormat attribute is set according to the DetNet PSN
   technology.  The attribute can be MPLS or IP.

5.4.  Identification and Specification of DetNet Flows

   Identification options for DetNet flows at the Ingress/Egress and
   within the DetNet domain are specified as follows; see Section 5.4.1
   for DetNet MPLS flows and Section 5.4.2 for DetNetw IP flows.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


5.4.1.  DetNet MPLS Flow Identification and Specification

   The identification of DetNet MPLS flows within the DetNet domain is
   based on the MPLS context in the service information model.  The
   attributes are specific to the MPLS forwarding paradigm within the
   DetNet domain [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  DetNet MPLS flows can be
   identified and specified by the following attributes:

   a.  SLabel
   b.  FLabelStack

5.4.2.  DetNet IP Flow Identification and Specification

   DetNet IP flows can be identified and specified by the following
   attributes [RFC8939]:

   a.  SourceIpAddress
   b.  DestinationIpAddress
   c.  IPv6FlowLabel
   d.  Dscp (attribute)
   e.  Protocol
   f.  SourcePort
   g.  DestinationPort
   h.  IPSecSpi

   The IP 6-tuple that is used for DetNet IP flow identification
   consists of items a, b, d, e, f, and g.  Items c and h are additional
   attributes that can be used for DetNet flow identification in
   addition to the 6-tuple.  6-tuple and use of wild cards for these
   attributes are specified in [RFC8939].

5.5.  Traffic Specification of the DetNet Flow

   DnTrafficSpecification attributes specify how the DN Ingress
   transmits packets for the DetNet flow.  This is effectively the
   promise/request of the DN Ingress to the network.  The network uses
   this traffic specification to allocate resources and adjust queue
   parameters in network nodes.

   TrafficSpecification has the following attributes:

   a.  Interval: the period of time in which the traffic specification
       is specified.

   b.  MaxPacketsPerInterval: the maximum number of packets that the
       Ingress will transmit in one Interval.





Varga, et al.             Expires July 28, 2021                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


   c.  MaxPayloadSize: the maximum payload size that the Ingress will
       transmit.

   d.  MinPayloadSize: the minimum payload size that the Ingress will
       transmit.

   e.  MinPacketsPerInterval: the minimum number of packets that the
       Ingress will transmit in one Interval.

   These attributes can be used to describe any type of traffic (e.g.,
   CBR, VBR, etc.) and can be used during resource allocation to
   represent worst case scenarios.  Intervals are specified as an
   integer number of nanoseconds.  PayloadSizes are specified in octets.

   Flows exceeding the traffic specification (i.e., having more traffic
   than defined by the maximum attributes) may receive a different
   network behavior than the DetNet network has been engineered for.
   Excess traffic due to malicious or malfunctioning devices can be
   prevented or mitigated (e.g., through the use of existing mechanisms
   such as policing and shaping).

   When MinPayloadSize and MinPacketsPerInterval parameters are used,
   then all packets less than the MinPayloadSize will be counted as
   being of the size MinPayloadSize during packet processing when packet
   size matters, e.g., when policing; and all flows having less than
   MinPacketsPerInterval will be counted as having MinPacketsPerInterval
   when the number of packets per interval matters, e.g., during
   resource reservation.  However, flows having less than
   MinPacketsPerInterval may result in a different network behavior than
   the DetNet network has been engineered for.  MinPayloadSize and
   MinPacketsPerInterval parameters, for example, may be used when
   engineering the latency bounds of a DetNet flow when POF is applied
   to the given DetNet flow.

   Further optional attributes can be considered to achieve more
   efficient resource allocation.  Such optional attributes might be
   worth for flows with soft requirements (i.e., the flow is only loss
   sensitive or only delay sensitive, but not both delay-and-loss
   sensitive).  Possible options how to extend DnTrafficSpecification
   attributes is for further discussion.

5.6.  Endpoints of the DetNet Flow

   The DnFlowEndpoints attribute defines the starting and termination
   reference points of the DetNet flow by pointing to the ingress
   interface/node and egress interface(s)/node(s).  Depending on the
   network scenario it defines an interface or a node.  Interface can be
   defined for example if the App-flow is a TSN Stream and it is

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


   received over a well defined UNI (User-to-Network Interface).  For
   example, for App-flows with MPLS encapsulation defining an ingress
   node is more common when per platform label space is used.

5.7.  Rank of the DetNet Flow

   The DnFlowRank attribute provides the rank of this flow relative to
   other flows in the DetNet domain.  Rank (range: 0-255) is used by the
   DetNet domain to decide which flows can and cannot exist when network
   resources reach their limit.  Rank is used to help to determine which
   flows can be bumped (i.e., removed from node configuration thereby
   releasing its resources) if for example a port of a node becomes
   oversubscribed (e.g., due to network re-configuration).  DnFlowRank
   value 0 is the highest priority.

5.8.  Status of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowStatus provides the status of the DetNet flow with respect to
   the establishment of the flow by the DetNet domain.

   The DnFlowStatus includes the following attributes:

   a.  DnIngressStatus is an enumeration for the status of the flow's
       Ingress reference point:

       *  None: no Ingress.
       *  Ready: Ingress is ready.
       *  Failed: Ingress failed.
       *  OutOfService: Administratively blocked.

   b.  DnEgressStatus is an enumeration for the status of the flow's
       Egress reference points:

       *  None: no Egress.
       *  Ready: all Egresses are ready.
       *  PartialFailed: One or more Egress ready, and one or more
          Egress failed.  The DetNet flow can be used if the Ingress is
          Ready.
       *  Failed: All Egresses failed.
       *  OutOfService: All Egresses are administratively blocked.

   c.  FailureCode: A non-zero code that specifies the error if the
       DetNet flow encounters a failure (e.g., packet replication and
       elimination is requested but not possible, or DnIngressStatus is
       Failed, or DnEgressStatus is Failed, or DnEgressStatus is
       PartialFailed).

   Defining FailureCodes for DetNet is out-of-scope in this document.
   Table 46-1 of [IEEE8021Qcc] describes TSN failure codes.

5.9.  Requirements of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowRequirements specifies requirements to ensure the service level
   desired for the DetNet flow.

   The DnFlowRequirements includes the following attributes:

   a.  MinBandwidth(Section 5.9.1)
   b.  MaxLatency(Section 5.9.2)
   c.  MaxLatencyVariation(Section 5.9.3)
   d.  MaxLoss(Section 5.9.4)
   e.  MaxConsecutiveLossTolerance(Section 5.9.5)
   f.  MaxMisordering(Section 5.9.6)

   MinBandwidth is the minimum bandwidth that has to be guaranteed for
   the DetNet flow.  MinBandwidth is specified in octets per second.

5.9.2.  Maximum Latency of the DetNet Flow

   MaxLatency is the maximum latency from Ingress to Egress(es) for a
   single packet of the DetNet flow.  MaxLatency is specified as an
   integer number of nanoseconds.

5.9.3.  Maximum Latency Variation of the DetNet Flow

   MaxLatencyVariation is the difference between the minimum and the
   maximum end-to-end one-way latency.  MaxLatencyVariation is specified
   as an integer number of nanoseconds.

5.9.4.  Maximum Loss of the DetNet Flow

   MaxLoss defines the maximum Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) requirement for
   the DetNet flow between the Ingress and Egress(es) and the loss
   measurement interval.

5.9.5.  Maximum Consecutive Loss of the DetNet Flow

   Some applications have special loss requirement, such as
   MaxConsecutiveLossTolerance.  The maximum consecutive loss tolerance
   parameter describes the maximum number of consecutive packets whose
   loss can be tolerated.  The maximum consecutive loss tolerance can be
   measured for example based on sequence number.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


5.9.6.  Maximum Misordering Tolerance of the DetNet Flow

   MaxMisordering describes the tolerable maximum number of packets that
   can be received out of order.  The value zero for the maximum allowed
   misordering indicates that in order delivery is required, misordering
   cannot be tolerated.

   The maximum allowed misordering can be measured for example based on
   sequence numbers.  When a packet arrives at the egress after a packet
   with a higher sequence number, the difference between the sequence
   number values cannot be bigger than "MaxMisordering + 1".

5.10.  BiDir requirement of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowBiDir attribute defines the requirement that the flow and the
   corresponding reverse direction flow must share the same path (links
   and nodes) through the routed or switch network in the DetNet domain,
   e.g., to provide congruent paths in the two directions that share
   fate and path characteristics.

6.  DetNet Service Related Parameters

   DetNet service have the following attributes:

   a.  DnServiceID (Section 6.1)
   b.  DnServiceDeliveryType (Section 6.2)
   c.  DnServiceDeliveryProfile (Section 6.3)
   d.  DNServiceConnectivity (Section 6.4)
   e.  DnServiceBiDir (Section 6.5)
   f.  DnServiceRank (Section 6.6)
   g.  DnServiceStatus (Section 6.7)

   Service attributes are described in the following sections.

6.1.  Management ID of the DetNet service

   A unique (management) identifier for each DetNet service within the
   DetNet domain.  It can be used to define the many to one mapping of
   DetNet flows to a DetNet service.

6.2.  Delivery Type of the DetNet service

   The DnServiceDeliveryType attribute is set according to the payload
   of the served DetNet flow (i.e., the encapsulated App-flow format).
   The attribute can be Ethernet, MPLS, or IP.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


6.3.  Delivery Profile of the DetNet Service

   DnServiceDeliveryProfile specifies delivery profile to ensure proper
   serving of the DetNet flow.

   The DnServiceDeliveryProfile includes the following attributes:

   a.  MinBandwidth(Section 6.3.1)
   b.  MaxLatency(Section 6.3.2)
   c.  MaxLatencyVariation(Section 6.3.3)
   d.  MaxLoss(Section 6.3.4)
   e.  MaxConsecutiveLossTolerance(Section 6.3.5)
   f.  MaxMisordering(Section 6.3.6)

6.3.1.  Minimum Bandwidth of the DetNet Service

   MinBandwidth is the minimum bandwidth that has to be guaranteed for
   the DetNet service.  MinBandwidth is specified in octets per second
   and excludes additional DetNet header (if any).

6.3.2.  Maximum Latency of the DetNet Service

   MaxLatency is the maximum latency from Ingress to Egress(es) for a
   single packet of the DetNet flow.  MaxLatency is specified as an
   integer number of nanoseconds.

6.3.3.  Maximum Latency Variation of the DetNet Service

   MaxLatencyVariation is the difference between the minimum and the
   maximum end-to-end one-way latency.  MaxLatencyVariation is specified
   as an integer number of nanoseconds.

6.3.4.  Maximum Loss of the DetNet Service

   MaxLoss defines the maximum Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) parameter for the
   DetNet service between the Ingress and Egress(es) of the DetNet
   domain.

6.3.5.  Maximum Consecutive Loss of the DetNet Service

   Some applications have special loss requirement, such as
   MaxConsecutiveLossTolerance.  The maximum consecutive loss tolerance
   parameter describes the maximum number of consecutive packets whose
   loss can be tolerated.  The maximum consecutive loss tolerance can be
   measured for example based on sequence number.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


6.3.6.  Maximum Misordering Tolerance of the DetNet Service

   MaxMisordering describes the tolerable maximum number of packets that
   can be received out of order.  The maximum allowed misordering can be
   measured for example based on sequence number.  The value zero for
   the maximum allowed misordering indicates that in order delivery is
   required, misordering cannot be tolerated.

6.4.  Connectivity Type of the DetNet Service

   Two connectivity types are distinguished: point-to-point (p2p) and
   point-to-multipoint (p2mp).  Connectivity type p2mp may be created by
   a forwarding function (e.g., p2mp LSP).  (Note: from service
   perspective mp2mp connectivity can be treated as a superposition of
   p2mp connections.)

6.5.  BiDir requirement of the DetNet Service

   The DnServiceBiDir attribute defines the requirement that the flow
   and the corresponding reverse direction flow must share the same path
   (links and nodes) through the routed or switch network in the DetNet
   domain, e.g., to provide congruent paths in the two directions that
   share fate and path characteristics.

6.6.  Rank of the DetNet Service

   The DnServiceRank attribute provides the rank of a service instance
   relative to other services in the DetNet domain.  DnServiceRank
   (range: 0-255) is used by the network in case of network resource
   limitation scenarios.  DnServiceRank value 0 is the highest priority.

6.7.  Status of the DetNet Service

   DnServiceStatus information group includes elements that specify the
   status of the service specific state of the DetNet domain.  This
   information group informs the user whether or not the service is
   ready for use.

   The DnServiceStatus includes the following attributes:

   a.  DnServiceIngressStatus is an enumeration for the status of the
       service's Ingress:

       *  None: no Ingress.
       *  Ready: Ingress is ready.
       *  Failed: Ingress failed.
       *  OutOfService: Administratively blocked.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


   b.  DnServiceEgressStatus is an enumeration for the status of the
       service's Egress:

       *  None: no Egress.
       *  Ready: all Egresses are ready.
       *  PartialFailed: One or more Egress ready, and one or more
          Egress failed.  The DetNet flow can be used if the Ingress is
          Ready.
       *  Failed: All Egresses failed.
       *  OutOfService: Administratively blocked.

   c.  DnServiceFailureCode: A non-zero code that specifies the error if
       the DetNet service encounters a failure (e.g., packet replication
       and elimination is requested but not possible, or
       DnServiceIngressStatus is Failed, or DnServiceEgressStatus is
       Failed, or DnServiceEgressStatus is PartialFailed).

   Defining DnServiceFailureCodes for DetNet service is out-of-scope in
   this document.  Table 46-1 of [IEEE8021Qcc] describes TSN failure
   codes.

7.  Flow Specific Operations

   The DetNet flow information model relies on three high level
   information groups:

   o  DnIngress: The DnIngress information group includes elements that
      specify the source for a single DetNet flow.  This information
      group is applied from the user of the DetNet service to the
      network.

   o  DnEgress: The DnEgress information group includes elements that
      specify the destination for a single DetNet flow.  This
      information group is applied from the user of the DetNet service
      to the network.

   o  DnFlowStatus: The status information group includes elements that
      specify the status of the flow in the network.  This information
      group is applied from the network to the user of the DetNet
      service.  This information group informs the user whether or not
      the DetNet flow is ready for use.

   There are three possible operations for each DetNet flow with respect
   to its DetNet service at a DN Ingress or a DN Egress (similarly to
   App-flows at a Source or a Destination):

   o  Join: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to join the flow.
   o  Leave: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to leave the flow.



Varga, et al.             Expires July 28, 2021                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model         January 2021


   o  Modify: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to change the flow.

7.1.  Join Operation

   For the join operation, the DnFlowSpecification, DnFlowRank,
   DnFlowEndpoint, and DnTrafficSpecification are included within the
   DnIngress or DnEgress information group.  For the join operation, the
   DnServiceRequirements groups can be included.

7.2.  Leave Operation

   For the leave operation, the DnFlowSpecification and DnFlowEndpoint
   are included within the DnIngress or DnEgress information group.

7.3.  Modify Operation

   For the modify operation, the DnFlowSpecification, DnFlowRank,
   DnFlowEndpoint, and DnTrafficSpecification are included within the
   DnIngress or DnEgress information group.  For the join operation, the
   DnServiceRequirements groups can be included.

   The Modify operation can be considered to address cases when a flow
   is slightly changed, e.g., only MaxPayloadSize (Section 5.5) has been
   changed.  The advantage of having a Modify is that it allows
   initiation of a change of flow spec while leaving the current flow is
   operating until the change is accepted.  If there is no linkage
   between the Join and the Leave, then while figuring out whether the
   new flow spec can be supported, the controller entity has to assume
   that the resources committed to the current flow are in use.  By
   using Modify the controller entity knows that the resources
   supporting the current flow can be available for supporting the
   altered flow.  Modify is considered to be an optional operation due
   to possible controller plane limitations.

8.  Summary

   This document describes the DetNet flow information model and the
   service information model for DetNet IP networks and DetNet MPLS
   networks.  These models are used as input for creating the DetNet
   specific YANG model.

10.  Security Considerations

   The external interfaces of the DetNet domain need to be subject to
   appropriate confidentiality.  Additionally, knowledge of which flows/
   services are provided to a customer or delivered by a network
   operator may supply information that can be used in a variety of
   security attacks.  Security considerations for DetNet are described
   in detail in [I-D.ietf-detnet-security].  General security
   considerations are described in [RFC8655].  This document discusses
   modeling the information, not how it is exchanged.
