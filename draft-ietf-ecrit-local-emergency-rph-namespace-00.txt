1.  Introduction

   This document creates and IANA registers the new Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority header (RPH) namespace "esnet" for 
   local emergency usage.  The SIP Resource-Priority header is defined 
   in RFC 4412 [RFC4412]. This new namespace can be from a caller in 
   distress, or added at the entry server into an emergency services 
   managed network, towards a public safety answering point (PSAP), 
   i.e., the 911 or 112-based emergency services call taker.  This
   new namespace can be used between PSAPs, and between a PSAP and 
   first responders and their organizations.  

   Within controlled environments, such as an IMS infrastructure or 
   Emergency Services network (ESINet), where misuse can be reduced to 
   a minimum where possible, providing an explicit priority indication 
   facilitates treatment of emergency SIP messages according to local 
   policy.  This indication is used to differentiate SIP signaling 
   requests, or dialogs, from other requests or dialogs.

   Usage of the "esnet" namespace is to be defined in a future 
   document(s). This document merely creates the namespace, per the 
   rules within [RFC4412] necessitating a Standards Track RFC for 
   IANA registering new RPH namespaces and their relative 
   priority-value order.   [RFC4412] further states that modifying the 
   order or the number of priority-values to a registered namespace 
   SHOULD NOT occur, due to interoperability issues with dissimilar 
   Implementations - perhaps separated by timing of each

   implementation. 

   From this fact about RFC 4412, and the possibility that within 
   emergency services networks, a Multilevel Precedence and Preemption 
   (MLPP)-like behavior can be achieved - ensuring more important calls
   are established or retained, the "esnet" namespace is given 5 
   priority-levels.  MLPP-like SIP signaling is not defined in this 
   document for 911/112/999 style emergency calling, but it is not 
   prevented either.

   Within the ESINet, there will be emergency calls requiring different
   treatments, according to the type of call.  Does a citizen's call to
   a PSAP require the same, a higher or a lower relative priority than 
   a PSAP's call to a police department, or the police chief?  What 
   about either - relative to a call from within the ESINet to a 
   federal government's department of national security, such as the US
   Department of Homeland Security?  For this reason, the "esnet" 
   namespace is given multiple priority levels.

   This document does not define any of these behaviors, outside of 
   reminding the rules of RFC 4412 apply - though examples of usage are
   included for completeness.  This document IANA registers the "esnet"
   RPH namespace for use within emergency services networks, not just 
   of those from citizens to PSAPs.


2.  Rules of Usage of the Resource Priority Header

   This document updates the behaviors of the SIP Resource Priority 
   header, defined in [RFC4412], during the treatment options 
   surrounding this new "esnet" namespace only. The usage of the 
   "esnet" namespace does not have a normal, or routine call level.  
   Every use of this namespace will be in times of an emergency, where 
   at least one end of the signaling is with a local emergency 
   organization.

   The "esnet" namespace has 5 priority-values, in a specified relative 
   priority order, and is a queue-based treatment namespace [RFC4412]. 
   Individual jurisdictions MAY configure their SIP entities for 
   preemption treatment, but this is optional, and a local policy 
   decision.

   Conceivably, this could be an example of a generic network diagram 
   where the "esnet" namespace is used:

       Figure 1: Where 'esnet' Namespace Can or Will be used

   In Figure 1., UAs connect to service providers that can have SIP 
   proxies.  When calling for emergency help, the UAs MAY include a 
   "esnet" namespace in the SIP request.  Use of this new namespace is 
   OPTIONAL, and likely is not trustworthy, unless SIP signaling is 
   within a managed environment starting at the originating UAC.  This 
   namespace, therefore, MAY be overwritten or deleted, contrary to the
   rules of RFC 4412 [RFC4412].  These proxies in the service provider 
   MAY either 

   o  accept the existing RPH value with "esnet" in it, if one is
      present, and grant relative preferential treatment to the request 
      when forwarding it to the ESINet.

   o  replace any existing RPH value, if one is present, and insert an

Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Oct 2008

      "esnet" namespace and give relative preferential treatment to the 
      request when forwarding it to the ESINet.

   o  insert an "esnet" namespace in a new RPH and give relative 
      preferential treatment to the request when forwarding the SIP 
      request towards the ESINet.

   Adjacent service providers can have a trust relationship in regards 
   to emergency calling, and the receiving service provider can accept 
   the inbound 'esnet' RPH namespace value and give preferential 
   treatment to the request when forwarding it to the ESINet.  

   On the other hand, SPs can choose to process each inbound SIP 
   requests with its own policies, based on the type of request it is, 
   in addition to the nature of the request.  If the request is 
   destined for a PSAP, according to the receiving SP, it MAY treat the
   request as if it were coming directly from a UA, and act according 
   to the 3 bullets above.

   Ultimately, the edge proxy at the ESINet will receive emergency SIP 
   request, and process the request according to its rules.  Regardless
   of what RPH indications there are in the message, and what 
   treatments the message has received, the ESINet edge proxy will 
   ensure there is an RPH with the "esnet" namespace in the request.  
   Local policy will dictate the priority-value to be assigned within 
   the ESINet.  This document makes no recommendations.


3.  "esnet" Namespace Definition

   One thing to keep in mind for now is the fact that this namespace 
   is not to be considered just "EMERGENCY" because there are a lot of 
   different kinds of emergencies, some on a military scale ([RFC4412] 
   defines 3 of these), some on a national scale ([RFC4412] defines 2 
   of these), some on an international scale.  These types of 
   emergencies can also have their own namespaces, and although there 
   are 5 defined for other uses, more are possible - so the 911/112/999
   style of public user emergency calling for police or fire or 
   ambulance (etc) does not have a monopoly on the word "emergency".

   Therefore the namespace "esnet" has been chosen, as it is most 
   recognizable as that of citizen calling for help from a public 
   authority type of organization.  This namespace will also be used 
   for communications between emergency authorities, and MAY be used 
   for emergency authorities calling public citizens.  An example of 
   the later is a PSAP operator calling back someone who previously 
   called 9111/112/999 and the communication was terminated before it 
   should have been (in the operator's judgment).

   Here is an example of a Resource-Priority header using the esnet 
   namespace:

Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Oct 2008

      Resource-Priority: esnet.0


3.1.  Namespace Definition Rules and Guidelines

   This specification defines one unique namespace for emergency 
   calling scenarios, "esnet", constituting its registration with IANA. 
   This IANA registration contains the facets defined in Section 9 of 
   [RFC4412].  

3.2.  The "esnet" Namespace

   Per the rules of [RFC4412], each namespace has a finite set of 
   relative priority-value(s), listed (below) from lowest priority to 
   highest priority.  In an attempt to not limit this namespace's use 
   in the future, more than one priority-value is assigned to the 
   "esnet" namespace.  This document does not RECOMMEND which 
   priority-value is used where.  That is for another document to 
   specify.  This document does RECOMMEND the choice within a national 
   jurisdiction is coordinated by all sub-jurisdictions to maintain 
   uniform SIP behavior throughout an emergency calling system.

   The relative priority order for the "esnet" namespace is as follows:

      (lowest)  esnet.0
                esnet.1
                esnet.2
                esnet.3
      (highest) esnet.4

   The "esnet" namespace will be assigned into the priority queuing 
   algorithm (Section 4.5.2 of [RFC4412]) from the public user to the 
   PSAP.  This does not limit its usage to only the priority queue 
   algorithm; meaning the preemption algorithm can be used where the 
   local jurisdiction preferred to preempt normal calls in lieu of 
   completing emergency calls.  This document is not RECOMMENDING this 
   usage, merely pointing out those behaviors is a matter of local 
   policy.

   NOTE: at this time, there has not been sufficient discussion about 
   whether or not preemption will be used for communications between 
   PSAPs or between PSAPs and First responders (and their 
   organizations).

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1  IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" of the sip-parameters 
   section of IANA (created by [RFC4412]), the following entries will 
   be added to this table:

                        Intended      New warn-   New resp.
   Namespace  Levels    Algorithm     code        code      Reference
   ---------  ------  --------------  ---------   --------- ---------
     esnet      5        queue           no          no     [This doc]


4.2  IANA Priority-Value Registrations

   Within the Resource-Priority Priority-values registry of the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the following (below) is to be added 
   to the table:

   Namespace: esnet
   Reference: (this document)
   Priority-Values (least to greatest): "0", "1","2", "3", "4"


5.  Security Considerations

   The Security considerations that apply to RFC 4412 [RFC4412] apply 
   here.  This document introduces no new security issues relative to 
   RFC 4412.

   That said, since this SIP header, used for emergency calling can 
   have a great impact on local communications, providers SHOULD use 
   caution when deciding if they want to use a preemption algorithm 
   within the public space for 911/112/999 type calling.  As 
   potentially already limited communications bandwidth might starve 
   out all other types of calls in a location.  This decision might be 
   desired; but this effect might not be desired.
