1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols (PIM-SM [RFC4601],
   BIDIR-PIM [RFC5015], and PIM-DM [RFC3973]).

   This document is part of work in progress to obsolete RFC 2934
   [RFC2934].  RFC 2934 defined an experimental MIB module for managing
   the PIM protocols.  The MIB module defined by this document is a re-
   working of the MIB module from RFC 2934, with major changes that
   include the following.

   o  This MIB module is independent of IP version, whereas RFC 2934
      only supported IPv4.

   o  This MIB module includes support for managing BIDIR-PIM.

   o  This MIB module retains limited support for managing PIM-DM
      [RFC3973], but that is no longer its primary purpose.

   o  This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM-SM v1.

   o  This MIB module does not depend on the IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB
      defined in RFC 2932 [RFC2932].

   o  This MIB module includes support for configuring static Rendezvous
      Points (RPs).

   o  This MIB module includes support for configuring anycast RPs
      [RFC4610].

2.  Terminology

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Overview

   This MIB module contains the following tables.

   1.   The PIM Interface Table, which contains one row per IP version
        for each interface of the router which is running PIM.

   2.   The PIM Neighbor Table, which contains one row for each of the
        router&#x27;s PIM neighbors.

   3.   The PIM Neighbor Secondary Address Table, which contains one row
        for each secondary address advertised by each of the router&#x27;s
        PIM neighbors.

   4.   The PIM (*,G) State Table, which contains one row for each group
        for which PIM has (*,G) state.

   5.   The PIM (*,G,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        group and interface for which PIM has interface-specific (*,G)
        state.

   6.   The PIM (S,G) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source and group for which PIM has (S,G) state.

   7.   The PIM (S,G,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source, group, and interface for which PIM has interface-
        specific (S,G) state.

   8.   The PIM (S,G,rpt) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source and group for which PIM has (S,G,rpt) state.

   9.   The PIM (S,G,rpt,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source, group, and interface for which PIM has interface-
        specific (S,G,rpt) state.

   10.  The PIM Bidir DF-Election Table, which contains one row per
        interface for each Rendezvous Point (RP) for which
        Bidirectional-PIM Designated Forwarder (DF) election state is
        maintained.

   11.  The PIM Static RP Table, which contains one row per range of
        multicast group addresses for which a particular configured RP
        should be used.

   12.  The PIM Group Mapping Table, which contains one row for each
        mapping from a multicast group address prefix to the PIM mode
        and RP address to use for groups within that group prefix,
        regardless of the source of the group mapping information.

   13.  The PIM Anycast-RP Set Table, which contains one row for each RP
        within each Anycast-RP set of which the local router is a
        member.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], and the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB
   [RTPROTO].  This MIB module REFERENCEs [RFC3376], [RFC3569],
   [RFC3618], [RFC3810], [RFC3956], [RFC3973], [RFC4601], [RFC4610],
   [RFC5015], [RFC5059], and [IPMCAST-MIB].

    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;The number of invalid PIM Register messages that have been
            received by this device.

            A PIM Register message is invalid if either

            o the destination address of the Register message does not
              match the Group to RP mapping on this device, or

            o this device believes the group address to be within an
              SSM address range, but this Register implies ASM usage.

            These conditions can occur transiently while RP mapping
            changes propagate through the network.  If this counter is
            incremented repeatedly over several minutes, then there is a
            persisting configuration error that requires correction.

            The active Group to RP mapping on this device is specified
            by the object pimGroupMappingPimMode.  If there is no such
            mapping, then the object pimGroupMappingPimMode is absent.
            The RP address contained in the invalid Register is
            pimInvalidRegisterRp.

            Multicast data carried by invalid Register messages is
            discarded.  The discarded data is from a source directly

            connected to pimInvalidRegisterOrigin, and is addressed to

    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;The number of invalid PIM Join/Prune messages that have
            been received by this device.

            A PIM Join/Prune message is invalid if either

            o the Group to RP mapping specified by this message does not
              match the Group to RP mapping on this device, or

            o this device believes the group address to be within an
              SSM address range, but this Join/Prune (*,G) or (S,G,rpt)
              implies ASM usage.

            These conditions can occur transiently while RP mapping
            changes propagate through the network.  If this counter is
            incremented repeatedly over several minutes, then there is a
            persisting configuration error that requires correction.

            The active Group to RP mapping on this device is specified
            by the object pimGroupMappingPimMode.  If there is no such
            mapping, then the object pimGroupMappingPimMode is absent.
            The RP address contained in the invalid Join/Prune is
            pimInvalidJoinPruneRp.

            Invalid Join/Prune messages are discarded.  This may result
            in loss of multicast data affecting listeners downstream of
            pimInvalidJoinPruneOrigin, for multicast data addressed to
            pimInvalidJoinPruneGroup.

            this object must remain set to FALSE.

            Changing the value of this object while the interface is

pimAnycastRPSetTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF PimAnycastRPSetEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;This table is used to manage Anycast-RP via PIM Register
            messages, as opposed to via other protocols such as MSDP
            (Multicast Source Discovery Protocol).

            Entries must be configured in this table if and only if the
            local router is a member of one or more Anycast-RP sets,
            that is, one or more Anycast-RP addresses are assigned to
            the local router.  Note that if using static RP
            configuration, this is in addition to, not instead of, the
            pimStaticRPTable entries that must be configured for the
            Anycast-RPs.

            The set of rows with the same values of both
            pimAnycastRPSetAddressType and pimAnycastRPSetAnycastAddress
            corresponds to the Anycast-RP set for that Anycast-RP
            address.

            When an Anycast-RP set configuration is active, one entry
            per pimAnycastRPSetAnycastAddress corresponds to the local
            router.  The local router is identified by the
            pimAnycastRpSetLocalRouter object.  That entry determines
            the source address used by the local router when forwarding
            PIM Register messages within the Anycast-RP set.&quot;

-- The PIM Group Mapping Table

pimGroupMappingTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF PimGroupMappingEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;The (conceptual) table listing mappings from multicast
            group prefixes to the PIM mode and RP address to use for
            groups within that group prefix.

            Rows in this table are created for a variety of reasons,
            indicated by the value of the pimGroupMappingOrigin object.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of &#x27;fixed&#x27; are
               created automatically by the router at startup, to
               correspond to the well-defined prefixes of link-local and
               unroutable group addresses.  These rows are never
               destroyed.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of &#x27;embedded&#x27; are
               created by the router to correspond to group prefixes
               that are to be treated as being in Embedded-RP format.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of &#x27;configRp&#x27; are
               created and destroyed as a result of rows in the
               pimStaticRPTable being created and destroyed.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of &#x27;configSsm&#x27;
               are created and destroyed as a result of configuration of
               SSM address ranges to the local router.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of &#x27;bsr&#x27; are
               created as a result of running the PIM Bootstrap Router
               (BSR) mechanism.  If the local router is not the elected
               BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group
               prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages received from the
               elected BSR.  If the local router is the elected BSR,
               these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in
               the PIM Bootstrap messages that the local router sends.
               In either case, these rows are destroyed when the group
               prefixes are timed out by the BSR mechanism.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of &#x27;other&#x27; are
               created and destroyed according to some other mechanism
               not specified here.

            Given the collection of rows in this table at any point in
            time, the PIM mode and RP address to use for a particular
            group is determined using the following algorithm.

            1. From the set of all rows, the subset whose group prefix
               contains the group in question are selected.

            2. If there are no such rows, then the group mapping is
               undefined.

            3. If there are multiple selected rows, and a subset is
               defined by pimStaticRPTable (pimGroupMappingOrigin value
               of &#x27;configRp&#x27;) with pimStaticRPOverrideDynamic set to
               TRUE, then this subset is selected.

            4. From the selected subset of rows, the subset that have
               the greatest value of pimGroupMappingGrpPrefixLength are
               selected.

            5. If there are still multiple selected rows, the subset
               that has the highest precedence (the lowest numerical

               value for pimGroupMappingPrecedence) is selected.

            6. If there are still multiple selected rows, the row
               selected is implementation dependent; the implementation
               might or might not apply the PIM hash function to select
               the row.

            7. The group mode to use is given by the value of
               pimGroupMappingPimMode from the single selected row; the
               RP to use is given by the value of
               pimGroupMappingRPAddress, unless pimGroupMappingOrigin is
               &#x27;embedded&#x27;, in which case, the RP is extracted from the
               group address in question.&quot;

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The following tables and objects could be employed to modify
   multicast routing behavior in a way that prevents, disrupts, or
   subverts services provided by the network, including (but not limited
   to) multicast data traffic delivery.  For example, attacks can be
   envisaged that would pass nominated multicast data streams through a
   nominated location, without the sources or listeners becoming aware
   of this subversion.

   pimAnycastRPSetAnycastAddress pimAnycastRPSetRouterAddress

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The following tables and objects could be employed to determine the
   topology, disposition, and composition of the network.  This
   information may be commercially sensitive, and may also be used in
   preparation for attacks, including any of the attacks described
   above.

   The following tables and objects may also be used to determine
   whether multicast data is flowing in the network, or has flowed
   recently.  They may also be used to determine the network location of
   senders and recipients.  An attacker can apply &#x27;traffic analysis&#x27; to
   this data.  In some cases, the information revealed by traffic
   analyses can be as damaging as full knowledge of the data being
   transported.

   There is also a specific danger arising from the notification
   pimInvalidRegister.  This is originated by devices that receive an
   incorrect unicast-encapsulated multicast data packet, which poses a
   clear danger of propagating a DoS (Denial of Service) attack from the
   data or control plane to the network management plane.  The following
   steps are taken to guard against this.

   1.  The notification is disabled by default.  The writeable field
       pimInvalidRegisterNotificationPeriod must be set in order to
       enable it.

   2.  The syntax of pimInvalidRegisterNotificationPeriod prevents any
       given device from originating the notification more frequently
       than once every 10 seconds.

   3.  The counter pimInvalidRegisterMsgsRcvd provides equivalent
       function to the notification.  Management applications are
       encouraged to monitor this counter in preference to enabling the
       notification.

   The same measures are taken in respect of pimInvalidJoinPrune, though
   as this notification can only arise as a result of unroutable control
   packets, the risk is not so acute.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   PIM-STD-MIB is rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA has assigned
   { mib-2 157 } to the PIM-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

8.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB module is based on the original work in RFC 2934 [RFC2934]
   by K. McCloghrie, D. Farinacci, D. Thaler, and W. Fenner and has been
   updated based on feedback from the IETF&#x27;s Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM) Working Group.

   Jonathan Nicholas was the editor of early versions of this document,
   and contributed the objects for management of PIM-DM.
