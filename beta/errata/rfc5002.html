Abstract

   This document specifies the SIP P-Profile-Key P-header.  This header
   field is used in the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS
   (IP Multimedia Subsystem) to provide SIP registrars and SIP proxy
   servers with the key of the profile corresponding to the destination
   SIP URI of a particular SIP request.

1.  Introduction

   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia
   Subsystem) uses SIP [RFC3261] as its main signalling protocol.  (For
   more information on the IMS, a detailed description can be found in
   3GPP TS 23.228 [3GPP.23.228] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [3GPP.24.229]).  3GPP
   has identified a set of requirements that can be met, according to
   the procedures in [RFC3427], by defining a new SIP P-header.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 3
   describes the scenario considered by 3GPP and Section 4 discusses the
   requirements derived from this scenario.  Section 5 defines the P-
   Profile-Key header field, which meets those requirements, and Section
   6 discusses the applicability and scope of this new header field.
   Section 7 registers the P-Profile-Key header field with the IANA and
   Section 8 discusses the security properties of the environment where
   this header field is intended to be used.

2.  Terminology

   HSS:     Home Subscriber Server.

   I-CSCF:  Interrogating - Call/Session Control Function.

   Public Service Identity:
            A SIP URI that refers to a service instead of a user.

   S-CSCF:  Serving - Call/Session Control Function.

   Wildcarded Public Service Identity:
            A set of Public Service Identities that match a regular
            expression and share the same profile.

3.  Scenario

   In the 3GPP IMS, there are scenarios where a set of proxies handling
   a request need to consult the same user database, as described in
   [RFC4457].  Those proxies typically use the destination SIP URI of
   the request as the key for their database queries.  Nevertheless,
   when a proxy handles a Wildcarded Public Service Identity, the key to
   be used in its database query is not the destination SIP URI of the
   request, but a regular expression instead.

   Public Service Identities are SIP URIs that refer to services instead
   of users.  That is, they address a specific application in an
   Application Server.  Wildcarded Public Service Identities are a set
   of Public Service Identities that match a regular expression and
   share the same profile.  For example, the Public Service Identities

   &#x27;sip:chatroom-12@example.com&#x27; and &#x27;sip:chatroom-657@example.com&#x27;
   would match the Wildcarded Public Service Identity
   &#x27;sip:chatroom-!.*!@example.com&#x27;.  For a description of Wildcarded
   Public Service Identities, see 3GPP TS 23.003 [3GPP.23.003].

   When a proxy queries the user database for a Public Service Identity
   for which there is no profile in the user database, the user database
   needs to find its matching Wildcarded Public Service Identity.  For
   example, if the user database receives a query for
   &#x27;sip:chatroom-657@example.com&#x27;, the user database needs to go through
   all the Wildcarded Public Service Identity it has until it finds a
   matching one; in this case, &#x27;sip:chatroom-!.*!@example.com&#x27;.  The
   process to find a matching Wildcarded Public Service Identity can be
   computationally expensive, time consuming, or both.

   When two proxies query the user database for the same Public Service
   Identity, which matches a Wildcarded Public Service Identity, the
   user database needs to perform the matching process twice.  Having to
   perform that process twice can be avoided by having the first proxy
   obtain the Wildcarded Public Service Identity from the user database
   and transfer it, piggy-backed in the SIP message, to the second
   proxy.  This way, the second proxy can query the user database using
   the Wildcarded Public Service Identity directly.

   An alternative, but undesirable, solution would consist of having the
   user database store every Public Service Identity and its matching
   Wildcarded Public Service Identity.  The scalability and
   manageability properties of this approach are considerably worse than
   those of the approach described earlier.

4.  Requirements

   This section lists the requirements derived from the previous
   scenario:

   1.  It is necessary to optimize the response time for session
       establishment in the 3GPP IMS.

   2.  It is necessary to keep the user database&#x27;s size and maintenance
       manageable (e.g., storing individual Public Service Identities
       matching a Wildcarded Public Service Identity in the user
       database is not believed to be an acceptable solution).

5.  P-Profile-Key Header Field Definition

   This document defines the SIP P-Profile-Key P-header.  The P-
   Profile-Key P-header contains the key to be used by a proxy to query
   the user database for a given profile.

   The augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [RFC4234] syntax of the
   P-Profile-Key header field is the following:

      P-Profile-Key     = &quot;P-Profile-Key&quot; HCOLON (name-addr / addr-spec)
                           *( SEMI generic-param )

   The format of HCOLON, name-addr, addr-spec, and generic-param are
   defined in [RFC3261].  The format of Wildcarded Public Service
   Identities is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3GPP.23.003].  They take the
   form of Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) as defined in Chapter 9 of
   IEEE 1003.1-2004 Part 1 [IEEE.1003.1-2004].

   The following is an example of a P-Profile-Key header field that
   contains a Wildcarded Public Service Identity:

      P-Profile-Key: &lt;sip:chatroom-!.*!@example.com&gt;

6.  Applicability

   According to [RFC3427], P-headers have a limited applicability.
   Specifications of P-headers such as this RFC need to clearly document
   the useful scope of the proposal, and explain its limitations and why
   it is not suitable for the general use of SIP on the Internet.

   The P-Profile-Key header field is intended to be used in 3GPP IMS
   networks.  This header field carries the key of a service profile,
   that is stored in a user database referred to as HSS, between two
   proxies, which are referred to as I-CSCF and S-CSCF.  The I-CSCF and
   the S-CSCF belong to the same administrative domain and share a
   common frame of reference to the user database.  The I-CSCF inserts
   the P-Profile-Key header field into a SIP request and the S-CSCF
   removes it before routing the request further.  (For a description of
   how an I-CSCF and an S-CSCF query the same user database for a single
   request, see [RFC4457].)

   Typically, when SIP is used on the Internet, there are not multiple
   proxies with a trust relationship between them querying the same user
   database.  Consequently, the P-Profile-Key header field does not seem
   useful in a general Internet environment.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new SIP header field: P-Profile-Key.  This
   header field has been registered by the IANA in the SIP Parameters
   registry under the Header Fields subregistry.

8.  Security Considerations

   The P-Profile-Key defined in this document is to be used in an
   environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are not
   supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those
   elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes
   achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically protecting the
   network.  In any case, the environment where the P-Profile-Key header
   field will be used ensures the integrity and the confidentiality of
   the contents of this header field.  The P-Profile-Key header field
   MUST NOT be used in environments that do not have these
   characteristics.

   The P-Profile-Key header field needs to be integrity protected to
   keep attackers from modifying its contents.  An attacker able to
   modify the contents of this header field could make the network apply
   a different service than the one corresponding to the request
   carrying the P-Profile-Key header field.

   The contents of the P-Profile-Key field need to be kept confidential.
   An attacker able to access the contents of this header field would
   obtain certain knowledge about the way services are structured in a
   given domain.
