1.  Introduction

   The PCE defined in [RFC4655] is an entity that is capable of
   computing a network path or route based on a network graph and
   applying computational constraints.  A PCC may make requests to a PCE
   for paths to be computed.

   PCEP is the communication protocol between a PCC and PCE and is
   defined in [RFC5440].  PCEP interactions include path computation
   requests and path computation replies as well as notifications of
   specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   Traffic Engineering (TE).

   This memo defines a portion of the MIB for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
   defines a MIB module that can be used to monitor PCEP interactions
   between a PCC and a PCE, or between two PCEs.

   The scope of this document is to provide a MIB module for the PCEP
   base protocol defined in [RFC5440].  Extensions to the PCEP base
   protocol are beyond the scope for this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot; and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655] and
   [RFC5440].  In particular, it uses the following acronyms.

   o  Path Computation Request (PCReq) message.

   o  Path Computation Reply (PCRep) message.

   o  Notification (PCNtf) message.

   o  Error (PCErr) message.

   o  Request Parameter (RP) object.

   o  Synchronization Vector (SVEC) object.

   o  Explicit Route Object (ERO).

   This document uses the term &quot;PCEP entity&quot; to refer to a local PCEP
   speaker, &quot;peer&quot; to refer to a remote PCEP speaker, and &quot;PCEP speaker&quot;
   where it is not necessary to distinguish between local and remote.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  PCEP MIB Module Architecture

   The PCEP MIB module contains the following information:

   a.  PCE and PCC local entity status (see pcePcepEntityTable).

   b.  PCEP peer information (see pcePcepPeerTable).

   c.  PCEP session information (see pcePcepSessTable).

   d.  Notifications to indicate PCEP session changes.

   The PCEP MIB module is limited to &quot;read-only&quot; access except for
   pcePcepNotificationsMaxRate, which is used to throttle the rate at
   which the implementation generates notifications.

3.1.  pcePcepEntityTable

   The PCEP MIB module may contain status information for multiple
   logical local PCEP entities.  There are several scenarios in which
   there may be more than one local PCEP entity, including the
   following.

   o  A physical router, which is partitioned into multiple virtual
      routers, each with its own PCC.

   o  A PCE device that front ends a cluster of compute resources, each
      with a different set of capabilities that are accessed via
      different IP addresses.

   The pcePcepEntityTable contains one row for each local PCEP entity.
   Each row is read-only and contains current status information, plus
   the PCEP entity&#x27;s running configuration.

   The pcePcepEntityTable is indexed by pcePcepEntityIndex, which also
   acts as the primary index for the other tables in this MIB module.

3.2.  pcePcepPeerTable

   The pcePcepPeerTable contains one row for each peer that the local
   PCEP entity knows about.  Each row is read-only and contains
   information to identify the peer, the running configuration relating
   to that peer, and statistics that track the messages exchanged with
   that peer and its response times.

   A PCEP speaker is identified by its IP address.  If there is a PCEP
   speaker in the network that uses multiple IP addresses, then it looks
   like multiple distinct peers to the other PCEP speakers in the
   network.

   The pcePcepPeerTable is indexed first by pcePcepEntityIndex, then by
   pcePcepPeerAddrType and pcePcepPeerAddr.  This indexing structure
   allows each local PCEP entity to report its own set of peers.

   Since PCEP sessions can be ephemeral, pcePcepPeerTable tracks a peer
   even when no PCEP session currently exists to that peer.  The
   statistics contained in pcePcepPeerTable are an aggregate of the
   statistics for all successive sessions to that peer.

   To limit the quantity of information that is stored, an
   implementation MAY choose to discard a row from pcePcepPeerTable if
   and only if no PCEP session exists to the corresponding peer.

3.3.  pcePcepSessTable

   The pcePcepSessTable contains one row for each PCEP session that the
   PCEP entity (PCE or PCC) is currently participating in.  Each row is
   read-only and contains the running configuration that is applied to
   the session, plus identifiers and statistics for the session.

   The statistics in pcePcepSessTable are semantically different from
   those in pcePcepPeerTable since the former applies to the current
   session only, whereas the latter is the aggregate for all sessions
   that have existed to that peer.

   Although it is forbidden per [RFC5440] to have more than one active
   PCEP session between a given pair of PCEP entities at any one time,
   there is a window during session establishment where the

   pcePcepSessTable may contain two rows for a given peer, one
   representing a session initiated by the local PCEP entity and one
   representing a session initiated by the peer.  If either of these
   sessions reaches an active state, then the other is discarded.

   The pcePcepSessTable is indexed first by pcePcepEntityIndex, then by
   pcePcepPeerAddrType and pcePcepPeerAddr, and finally by
   pcePcepSessInitiator.  This indexing structure allows each local PCEP
   entity to report its own set of active sessions.  The
   pcePcepSessInitiator index allows two rows to exist transiently for a
   given peer, as discussed above.

3.4.  PCEP Notifications

   The PCEP MIB module contains notifications for the following
   conditions.

   a.  pcePcepSessUp: PCEP session has gone up.

   b.  pcePcepSessDown: PCEP session has gone down.

   c.  pcePcepSessLocalOverload: Local PCEP entity has sent an overload
       PCNtf on this session.

   d.  pcePcepSessLocalOverloadClear: Local PCEP entity has sent an
       overload-cleared PCNtf on this session.

   e.  pcePcepSessPeerOverload: Peer has sent an overload PCNtf on this
       session.

   f.  pcePcepSessPeerOverloadClear: Peer has sent an overload-cleared
       PCNtf on this session.

3.5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The PCEP MIB module imports the following textual conventions from
   the INET-ADDRESS-MIB defined in RFC 4001 [RFC4001]:

   o  InetAddressType

   o  InetAddress

   PCEP relies on existing protocols that have specialized MIB objects
   to monitor their own activities.  Consequently, this document
   considers that the monitoring of underlying protocols is out of scope
   of the PCEP MIB module.

3.6.  Illustrative Example

   The following diagram illustrates the relationships between
   pcePcepEntityTable, pcePcepPeerTable, and pcePcepSessTable.

       DESCRIPTION
           &quot;The value of SyncTimer is used in the case of a synchronized
            path computation request using the SVEC object.

            Consider the case where a PCReq message is received by a PCE
            that contains the SVEC object referring to M synchronized
            path computation requests.  If after the expiration of the
            SyncTimer all the M path computation requests have not been
            received, a protocol error is triggered and the PCE MUST
            cancel the whole set of path computation requests.

            The aim of the SyncTimer is to avoid the storage of unused
            synchronized requests should one of them get lost for some
            reason (for example, a misbehaving PCC).

5.  Security Considerations

   The pcePcepNotificationsMaxRate object defined in this MIB module has
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection opens devices to attack.  In particular,
   pcePcepNotificationsMaxRate may be used improperly to stop
   notifications being issued or to permit a flood of notifications to
   be sent to the management agent at a high rate.

   All the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  The sensitivity/vulnerability arises because,
   collectively, these objects provide information about the amount and
   frequency of path computation requests and responses within the
   network and can reveal some aspects of its configuration.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)

   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------
        pcePcepMIB         { mib-2 227 }

Appendix A.  PCEP MIB Module Example

   This example considers the set of PCC/PCE relationships shown in the
   following figure.  The example shows the contents of the PCEP MIB
   module as read at PCE2 and PCCb.

       PCE1---PCE2   PCE3
         |   /  |    /  |
         |  /   |   /   |
       PCCa/    PCCb   PCCc

   The IP addresses of the PCE speakers in this diagram are given in the
   following table.

       +------+-------------+
       | PCE1 | 1.1.1.1     |
       +------+-------------+
       | PCE2 | 2.2.2.2     |
       +------+-------------+
       | PCE3 | 3.3.3.3     |
       +------+-------------+
       | PCCa | 11.11.11.11 |
       +------+-------------+
       | PCCb | 22.22.22.22 |
       +------+-------------+
       | PCCc | 33.33.33.33 |
       +------+-------------+

   In this example, the PCEP session between PCCb and PCE3 is currently
   down.

A.1.  Contents of PCEP MIB Module at PCE2

   At PCE2, there is a single local PCEP entity that has three peers
   (PCCa, PCCb, and PCE1).  There is a session active to all of these
   peers.

   The contents of the PCEP MIB module as read at PCE2 are as follows.

A.2.  Contents of PCEP MIB Module at PCCb

   At PCCb, there is a single local PCEP entity that has two peers (PCE2
   and PCE3).  There is a session active to PCE2, but the session to
   PCE3 is currently down.

   The contents of the PCEP MIB module as read at PCCb are as follows.
