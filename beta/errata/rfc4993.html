1.  Introduction

   Using Straightforward Name Authority Pointers (S-NAPTR) [4], IRIS has
   the ability to define the use of multiple application transports or
   transfer protocols for different types of registry services, all at
   the discretion of the server operator.  The UDP transfer protocol
   defined in this document is completely independent of the registry
   types for which it can carry data.

   The binding of this UDP transfer protocol to IRIS is called IRIS-LWZ
   (for IRIS Lightweight using Compression).  Its message exchange
   pattern is simple: a client sends a request in one UDP packet, and a
   server responds with an answer in one UDP packet.

   IRIS-LWZ packets are composed of two parts, a binary payload
   descriptor and a request/response transaction payload.  The request/
   response transaction payload may be compressed using the DEFLATE [1]
   algorithm.

2.  Document Terminology

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].

   Octet fields with numeric values are given according to the
   conventions in RFC 1166 [10]: the leftmost bit of the whole field is
   the most significant bit; when a multi-octet quantity is transmitted
   the most significant octet is transmitted first.  Bits signifying
   flags in an octet are numbered according to the conventions of RFC
   1166 [10]: bit 0 is the most significant bit and bit 7 is the least
   significant bit.  When a diagram describes a group of octets, the
   order of transmission for the octets starts from the left.

3.  Packet Format

   The packet format for IRIS-LWZ is as follows:

         +------------+---------+
   field |  payload   | payload |
         | descriptor |         |
         +------------+---------+
   octets 3 or 6..261*    0..n

     * In request packets, the payload descriptor can vary in length
       from 6 to 261 octets (i.e., 6..261).  In response packets, the
       payload descriptor is always 3 octets.

                                IRIS-LWZ Packet

       Each IRIS-LWZ query or response is contained in a single UDP
       packet.  Servers MUST be prepared to accept packets as large as
       4000 octets, and clients MUST NOT send packets larger than 4000
       octets.

3.1.  Payload Descriptor

       The payload descriptor has two different formats, one for a
       request and one for a response.  However, each format shares a
       common 1-octet payload header described in Section 3.1.3.

3.1.1.  Payload Request Descriptor

       The payload descriptor for request packets varies from 6 to 261
       octets in length and has the following format:

             +--------+-------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
       field | header | transaction | maximum  | authority | authority |
             |        |     ID      | response |  length   |           |
             |        |             | length   |           |           |
             +--------+-------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
       octets    1           2           2           1         0..255

                          Request Payload Descriptor

       These fields have the following meanings:

       o  header - as described in Section 3.1.3.

   o  transaction ID - a 16-bit value identifying the transaction.  This
      value will be returned in the payload response descriptor (Section
      3.1.2) and can be used by clients to match requests with

      responses.  Clients SHOULD NOT use sequential values (see Section
      8).  Clients MUST NOT set all the bits in this value to 1 (i.e.,
      use a value of 0xFFFF).

   o  maximum response length - the total length of the UDP packet
      (i.e., UDP header length + payload descriptor length + XML payload
      length) that should not be exceeded when responding to this
      request.  If the server cannot provide a response that is equal to
      or less than this value, then it MUST respond with size
      information (Section 3.1.6).

   o  authority length - the length of the authority field in this
      payload descriptor.

   o  authority - a string of octets describing the authority against
      which this request is to be executed.  See [3] for the definition
      and description of an authority.  The number of octets in this
      string MUST be no more and no less than the number specified by
      the authority length.

3.1.2.  Payload Response Descriptor

   The payload descriptor for response packets is always 3 octets and
   consists of a payload header (Section 3.1.3) and a transaction ID.

         +--------+-------------+
   field | header | transaction |
         |        |     ID      |
         +--------+-------------+
   octets    1           2

                        Payload Response Descriptor

   The purpose of the transaction ID is to allow clients to match
   requests to responses.  A value of 0xFFFF is reserved for server use.
   The value of the transaction ID is as follows:

   1.  If the transaction ID in the corresponding request could not be
       read due to truncation, servers MUST use a transaction ID with
       all bits set to 1 (i.e., a value of OxFFFF) and send a descriptor
       error (see Section 3.1.7).

   2.  If the transaction ID in the corresponding request is a value of
       0xFFFF, servers MUST use a transaction ID of 0xFFFF and send a
       descriptor error (see Section 3.1.7).

   3.  Otherwise, the transaction ID MUST be the value of the
       transaction ID of the corresponding request.

3.1.3.  Payload Header

   The bits of the payload header are ordered according to RFC 1166
   [10], where bit 0 is the most significant and bit 7 is the least
   significant.  Each bit in the 1-octet payload header has the
   following meaning:

   o  bits 0 and 1 - version number (&#x27;V&#x27; field) - If 0 (both bits are
      zero), the protocol is the version defined in this document.
      Otherwise, the rest of the bits in the header and the payload may
      be interpreted as another version.

   o  bit 2 - request/response flag (&#x27;RR&#x27; flag) - If 0, this packet is a
      request (Section 3.1.1) packet.  If 1, this packet is a response
      (Section 3.1.2) packet.

   o  bits 3 - payload deflated (&#x27;PD&#x27; flag) - If 1, the payload is
      compressed using the DEFLATE [1] algorithm.

   o  bit 4 - deflate supported (&#x27;DS&#x27; flag) - If 1, the sender of this
      packet supports compression using the DEFLATE algorithm.  When
      this bit is 0 in a request, the payload of the response MUST NOT
      be compressed with DEFLATE.

   o  bit 5 - reserved - This MUST be 0.

   o  bits 6 and 7 - The value of these bits indicates payload types
      (Section 3.1.4) (&#x27;PT&#x27; field).

3.1.4.  Payload Types

   A payload type indicates the type of content in the UDP packet
   following the payload descriptor.  Some payload types have no meaning
   in request packets, and some payload types differ in meaning between
   requests and responses.  Some payload types indicate an empty
   payload.

   The payload type values in binary are as follows:

      00 - xml payload (&#x27;xml&#x27; type).  The payload is either an IRIS-
      based XML request or an IRIS-based XML response.

      01 - version info (&#x27;vi&#x27; type).  In a request packet, this payload
      type indicates that the server is to respond with version
      information (Section 3.1.5), and that the payload is empty.  In a
      response packet, this payload type indicates that the payload is
      version information (Section 3.1.5).

      10 - size info (&#x27;si&#x27; type).  This payload type has no meaning in a
      request packet and is a descriptor error.  In a response packet,
      this payload type indicates that the payload is size information
      (Section 3.1.6).

      11 - other info (&#x27;oi&#x27; type).  This payload type has no meaning in
      a request packet and is a descriptor error.  In a response packet,
      this payload type indicates that the payload is other information
      (Section 3.1.7).

3.1.5.  Version Information

<div class='Verified-endnote-styling' id='eid1010'>
<pre>
<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid1010'>EID 1010</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 3.1.5

<b>Original Text:</b>

The first paragraph of Section 3.1.5, on page 97of RFC 4993, says:

|  A payload type with version information (&#x27;vi&#x27;) MUST be conformant to
   the XML defined in [8] and use the &lt;versions&gt; element as the root
   element.

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

|  A payload type with version information (&#x27;vi&#x27;) sent from the server
|  to the client MUST be conformant to the XML defined in [8] and use
   the &lt;versions&gt; element as the root element.
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
As mentioned in other places of the text, this requirements language<br/>is improper because it is intended to allow clients to send this<br/>type of chunk as well, with unspecified (perhaps empty) content,<br/>to be ignored by the server.<br/><br/>Note: This issue is a replication of the issue detailed in item (A.3)<br/>for RFC 4992.
</div>
   A payload type with version information (&#x27;vi&#x27;) MUST be conformant to
   the XML defined in [8] and use the &lt;versions&gt; element as the root
   element.

   In the context of IRIS-LWZ, the protocol identifiers for these
   elements are as follows:

      &lt;transferProtocol&gt; - the value &quot;iris.lwz1&quot; to indicate the
      protocol specified in this document.

      &lt;application&gt; - the XML namespace identifier for IRIS [3].

      &lt;dataModel&gt; - the XML namespace identifier for IRIS registries.

   This document defines no extension identifiers and no authentication
   mechanism identifiers.

   Servers SHOULD send version information in the following cases:

   1.  In response to a version information request (i.e., the PT field
       is set to &#x27;vi&#x27;).

   2.  The version in a payload descriptor header does not match a
       version the server supports.

   3.  The IRIS-based XML payload does not match a version the server
       supports.

   The protocols identified by the &lt;transferProtocol&gt; element MUST only
   indicate protocols running on the same socket as the sender of the
   corresponding response.  In other words, while a server operator may
   also be running IRIS-XPC [9], this XML instance is only intended to
   describe version negotiation for IRIS-LWZ.

   The octet size for the &#x27;requestSizeOctets&#x27; and &#x27;responseSizeOctets&#x27;
   attributes of the &lt;tranferProtocol&gt; element are defined in Section
   3.1.6.

3.1.6.  Size Information

   A payload type with size information (&#x27;si&#x27;) MUST be conformant to the
   XML defined in [8] and use the &lt;size&gt; element as the root element.

   Octet counts provided by this information are defined as the total
   length of the UDP packet (i.e., UDP header length + payload
   descriptor length + XML payload length).

3.1.7.  Other Information

   A payload type with other information (&#x27;oi&#x27;) MUST be conformant to
   the XML defined in [8] and use the &lt;other&gt; element as the root
   element.

   The values for the &#x27;type&#x27; attribute of &lt;other&gt; are as follows:

      &#x27;descriptor-error&#x27; - indicates there was an error decoding the
      descriptor.  Servers SHOULD send a descriptor error in the
      following cases:

      1.  When a request is received with a payload type indicating size
          information (i.e., the PT field is &#x27;si&#x27;).

      2.  When a request is received with a payload type indicating
          other information (i.e., the PT field is &#x27;oi&#x27;).

      3.  When a request is sent with a transaction ID of 0xFFFF (which
          is reserved for server use).

      4.  When a request is received with an incomplete or truncated
          payload descriptor.

      5.  When reserved bits in the payload descriptor are set to values
          other than zero.

      &#x27;payload-error&#x27; - indicates there was an error interpreting the
      payload.  Servers MUST send a payload error if they receive XML
      (i.e., the PT field is set to &#x27;xml&#x27;) and the XML cannot be parsed.

      &#x27;system-error&#x27; - indicates that the receiver cannot process the
      request due to a condition not related to this protocol.  Servers
      SHOULD send a system-error when they are capable of responding to
      requests but not capable of processing requests.

      &#x27;authority-error&#x27; - indicates that the intended authority
      specified in the corresponding request is not served by the
      receiver.  Servers SHOULD send an authority error when they
      receive a request directed to an authority other than those they
      serve.

      &#x27;no-inflation-support-error&#x27; - indicates that the receiver does
      not support payloads that have been compressed with DEFLATE [1].
      Servers MUST send this error when they receive a request that has
      been compressed with DEFLATE but they do not support inflation.

4.  Interactions

   The intent of IRIS-LWZ is to utilize UDP for IRIS requests and
   responses when UDP is appropriate.  Not all IRIS requests and
   responses will be able to utilize UDP and may require the use of
   other transfer protocols (i.e., IRIS-XPC [9] and/or Blocks Extensible
   Exchange Protocol (BEEP)).  The following strategy SHOULD be used:

   1.  If a request requires authentication, confidentiality, or other
       security, use another transfer protocol.  IRIS-XPC [9] is
       RECOMMENDED.

   2.  The maximum packet size should be calculated as follows:

       a.  If the path MTU is unknown, the maximum packet size MUST be
           1500 octets.

       b.  If the path MTU is known, the maximum packet size MUST NOT
           exceed the path MTU and MUST NOT exceed 4000 octets.

   3.  If a request is less than or equal to the maximum packet size,
       send it uncompressed.

   4.  If a request can be compressed to a size less than or equal to
       the maximum packet size, send the request using compression.
       Otherwise, use another transfer protocol.  In cases where another
       transfer protocol is needed, IRIS-XPC [9] is RECOMMENDED.

   5.  If a request yields a size error, send the request with another
       transfer protocol.  IRIS-XPC [9] is RECOMMENDED.

   For retransmission of requests considered to be unanswered, a client
   SHOULD retransmit using a timeout value initially set to 1 second.
   This timeout value SHOULD be doubled for every retransmission, and a
   client SHOULD NOT retransmit any request once the timeout value has
   reached 60 seconds.

   Clients that use timeout values other than the recommendations above
   MUST allocate or have allocated dedicated network resources that will
   ensure fairness to other network packets and avoid network
   congestion.

   Clients MUST NOT have more than one outstanding request (i.e., an
   unanswered request that has not timed out) at a time unless they
   allocate or have been allocated dedicated network bandwidth and
   resources reserved specifically for this purpose.

   Finally, if a client intends multiple requests to the same server in
   a short amount of time, this protocol offers no real advantage over
   IRIS-XPC [9].  In such a case, IRIS-XPC is RECOMMENDED to be used as
   it would be similarly or more efficient and would offer greater
   response sizes and allow better security.

5.  Internationalization Considerations

   XML processors are obliged to recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16 [2]
   encodings.  Use of the XML defined by [8] MUST NOT use any other
   character encodings other than UTF-8 or UTF-16.

<b>Original Text:</b>

The first paragraph of Section 8, on page 12 of RFC 4993, says:

   IRIS-LWZ is intended for serving public data; it provides no in-band
   mechanisms for authentication or confidentiality.  Any application
   with these needs must provide out-of-band mechanisms (e.g., IPsec),

<b>Notes:</b><br/>
The last phrase fatally misses the requirement.<br/>The needed services are only provided by the TLS encapsulation of<br/>IRIS-XPC, the compound protocol being named IRIS over XPCS in [9], and<br/>that is being made visible via explicit iris.xpcs URIs [9].<br/><br/>Alexey: the term IRIS-XPCS is not defined in [9], but &quot;IRIS over XPCS&quot; is used.

</div>
   IRIS-LWZ is intended for serving public data; it provides no in-band
   mechanisms for authentication or confidentiality.  Any application
   with these needs must provide out-of-band mechanisms (e.g., IPsec),
   or use the IRIS transfer protocols that provide such capabilities,
   such as IRIS-XPC [9].

   Due to this lack of security, it is possible for an attacker to alter
   IRIS-LWZ messages sent from the client to the server and from the
   server to the client.  Such an attack can result in denying usage of
   an IRIS service or in supplying false information to end users and
   many other scenarios.

   Because IRIS-LWZ is a UDP-based protocol, it is possible for servers
   using IRIS-LWZ to be used in a type of distributed denial-of-service
   attack known as a reflection attack.  This type of attack affects
   other types of UDP-using protocols, such as DNS.  Server operators
   should be prepared to apply the same methods used for mitigating
   reflection attacks with other protocols, such as DNS, when using
   IRIS-LWZ.  All operators should follow the advice given in BCP 38
   [7].

   IRIS-LWZ uses transaction IDs in the payload descriptors to better
   enable a client to match a response to a request.  By randomizing the
   transaction IDs being used (i.e., not using sequential numbers),
   attackers flooding the network with a large amount of spoofed packets
   have a lesser chance of succeeding with the attack.  This measure is
   not guaranteed to thwart any such attack.  Client implementers MUST
   take appropriate measures when ignoring this advice.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This section gives examples of IRIS-LWZ exchanges.  Lines beginning
   with &quot;C:&quot; denote data sent by the client to the server, and lines
   beginning with &quot;S:&quot; denote data sent by the server to the client.
   Following the &quot;C:&quot; or &quot;S:&quot;, the line contains either octet values in
   hexadecimal notation with comments or XML fragments.  No line
   contains both octet values with comments and XML fragments.  Comments
   are contained within parentheses.

   The following example demonstrates an IRIS client requesting a lookup
   of &#x27;AUP&#x27; in the &#x27;local&#x27; entity class of a &#x27;dreg1&#x27; registry.  The
   client passes a bag (see [3]) with the search request.  The server
   responds with a &#x27;nameNotFound&#x27; response and an explanation.

                                 Example 1

   The following example demonstrates an IRIS client requesting domain
   availability information for &#x27;milo.example.com&#x27;.  The server responds
   that the domain is assigned and active.

                                 Example 2

   The following example demonstrates an IRIS client requesting domain
   availability information for felix.example.net, hobbes.example.net,
   and daffy.example.net.  The client does not support responses
   compressed with DEFLATE, and the maximum UDP packet it can safely
   receive is 498 octets.  The server responds with size information
   indicating that it would take 1211 octets to provide an answer.

   C:           (request packet)
   C: 0x00      (header: V=0,RR=request,PD=no,DS=no,PT=xml)

   The following example illustrates an IRIS client requesting the
   version information from a server, and the server returning the
   version information.
