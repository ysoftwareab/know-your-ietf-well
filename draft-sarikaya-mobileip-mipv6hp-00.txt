Abstract

   This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging
   (HMIPv6HP), an IP host alerting protocol which is a link-layer
   independent extension to Hierarchical Mobile IPv6. The extension
   allows a mobile node to enter a power saving dormant mode during
   which its location is known with coarse accuracy defined by a paging
   area. In the visited domain only the paging mobility anchor point
   (PMAP) is responsible for keeping the binding cache entries for
   dormant mobile nodes and, it re-establishes the downlink routes on
   demand by means of paging. Paging is initiated by the paging agent
   (PA) and the access routers in paging areas and does not involve
   periodic layer 3 messages to be sent except for time-slot based
   paging which is optional and is to be used on links with no support
   for layer 2 paging.

                   Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging          July 2001


1. Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to Mobile IPv6 [1] with
   hierarchical mobility management [2] in order to support power-
   constrained operation and to reduce routing state information in the
   visited domain. The protocol assumes a Hierarchical Mobile
   IPv6 network utilizing a Mobility Anchor Point extended with paging
   support called Paging Mobility Anchor Point (PMAP). The Paging
   Mobility Anchor Point is a MAP which is at highest distance from the
   mobile nodes (MN) in the visited domain. The protocol assumes a new
   entity called Paging Agent (PA) as in [3], which is in charge of
   paging dormant mobile nodes. The access points below PA may
   optionally be organized into several paging areas. In the protocol
   hmipv6hp, MN uses either the basic or the extended mode of operation
   of HMIPv6 while roaming within a MAP's domain.

   Access routers advertise paging support by including a Paging Area ID
   extension in their Router Advertisements. A mobile node that wishes
   to enter into dormant mode sends a Regional Binding
   Update with a Dormant Mode Request extension to the PMAP. The PMAP
   sends a binding acknowledgement with Dormant Mode Reply extension to
   the mobile node. After this, the binding cache entry at the
   intermediate
   MAP router hierarchy is removed except at the PMAP.

   The mobile node enters the active mode by performing a normal
   regional registration, i.e. binding the RCOA to its on-link COA
   (LCOA). The network may trigger this by paging the
   mobile node. The network pages the mobile node by sending a Router
   Advertisement to all dormant nodes multicast address with a Paged
   Mobile Node Address extension called Paging Router Advertisement
   (Paging RA). The paging router advertisement starts layer 2 paging
   process which eventually wakes up the mobile node.

   Time slot based paging can optionally be used when there is no link
   layer support for paging. Solicited-Node Multicast Address obtained
   from the home address of the mobile node
   is used as the destination of the paging router advertisement if only
   a single MN is to be paged. Paging router advertisements are sent
   periodically until the mobile node is waken up.


2. Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [4].

   Please see [5] for definition of terms used in describing paging. In
   addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Dormant Mode Registration


Sarikaya,Xu, Choyi                      Expires January 2002        3

                   Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging          July 2001


   The mobile node is required to perform an dormant mode registration
   by sending a Mobile IPv6 Binding Update destination option with
   extensions before entering the dormant mode.

   Paging Router Advertisement

   Access routers send in addition to the Mobile IPv6 router
   advertisements, messages called paging router advertisements to the
   paging multicast address to page the mobile nodes in dormant mode.
   The paging multicast address is all dormant nodes multicast address
   except when time-slot based paging is used.

   Time-Slot Based Paging

   If time-slot based paging is used the mobile node is paged in exact
   time slots based on the paging slot index, paging slot offset and
   paging slot interval values. All these values are made known to the
   mobile node before it enters the dormant mode. Paging RAs are
   periodic and are sent to the solicited-node multicast address of the
   home address or to a joint multicast address if several MNs are paged
   simultaneously.

   Paging Mobility Anchor Point

   In a hierarchical Mobile IPv6 network, the Paging Mobility Anchor
   Point (PMAP) is the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) which is of highest
   distance from the MN. In single hierarchy MAP domains, MAP assumes
   the functionality of PMAP.

   Paging Agent

   In a hierarchical Mobile IPv6 network, the Paging Agent (PA) is the
   entity which is in charge of paging the mobile nodes. PA initiates
   the paging after receiving a request from PMAP and the real paging is
   performed at the link layer.

   Paging Multicast Address

   An IPv6 multicast address used for paging a mobile node by an access
   router. All dormant nodes multicast address is used normally. All
   dormant nodes multicast address is permanently assigned and is of
   link-local scope. In the optional time-slot based paging, solicited-
   node multicast address obtained from the home address is the paging
   multicast address if the mobile node is paged individually. For
   efficiency purposes a single paging multicast address may be used to
   page more than one mobile node. In this case the paging multicast
   address is an IPv6 multicast address which is transient and is of
   global scope.

   Paging Area Multicast Address

   The access routers below PA in hierarchy are organized in the form of
   paging areas. Each region may have one or more paging areas indicated

Sarikaya,Xu, Choyi                      Expires January 2002        4

                   Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging          July 2001


   by PA1, PA2, ..., PAn. The access routers in paging area i are members
   of the paging area multicast address (PAMAi). A paging area multicast
   address is an IPv6 multicast address which is permanently assigned
   and is of global scope.

3. Protocol Operation
3.1. Paging Area Discovery
   An access router advertises paging support with the Paging Area ID
   extension in the Router Advertisement. The mobile node (MN) detects
   its current paging area based on the paging area ID. Access routers
   of neighboring cells may advertise the same paging area ID if they
   belong the same paging area.

   The paging agent is in charge of paging areas in the domain. The
   access routers in each paging area are members of an IPv6 multicast
   address that uniquely identifies the paging area. The paging area
   multicast address is a permanent address with global scope. The
   paging area multicast address has the form:
   FF0E::Group-id
   where Group-id is a 32-bit unique group id which MUST be equal to the
   Paging Area ID. Each access router MAY advertise a unique paging area
   ID or a collection of adjacent access routers may advertise a unique
   paging area ID.

   If time slot based paging is supported (Section 3.3.1), the router
   advertisement MUST also contain an Advertisement Interval extension
   which specifies the time interval between subsequent router
   advertisements. An Advertisement Interval extension with non-zero
   slot length field indicates support for time slot based paging within
   the paging area. All access routers in the same paging area send
   router advertisements simultaneously with the same advertisement
   interval. A new field in the Advertisement Interval extension
   indicates the length of the advertisement slot in milliseconds. The
   advertisement slot is the time during which MN powers on its receiver
   in order to receive unsolicited Router Advertisements. Slot sequence
   number is another new field in the Advertisement Interval extension
   that is used for determining MN's paging slot.

3.1.1 Moving in Paging Areas

   When a dormant MN detects that it has moved into a new paging area,
   it MUST perform either a normal home registration, a normal regional
   registration or a dormant mode registration. Paging area detection in
   dormant mode may not be possible in some links. If the dormant mode
   MN sends a dormant mode registration, PMAP modifies the paging area
   ID in its binding cache.

3.2. Entering Dormant Mode

   When MN is sending or receiving packets it is in the active mode.
   When MN is in active mode, the operation is exactly the same as in
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 using the basic or extended modes on a MAP's
   subnet.

Sarikaya,Xu, Choyi                      Expires January 2002        5

                   Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging          July 2001



   When MN is not actively communicating, it can enter the dormant mode.
   When in dormant mode, the visited domain does not know the exact
   location of MN. The visited domain knows the paging area of the
   dormant MN.

   When MN wishes to enter the dormant mode, it performs a dormant mode
   registration by sending a Regional Binding Update with a Dormant Mode
   Request extension. The destination address of the Regional Binding
   Update with a Dormant Mode extension is the PMAP. MN may also enter
   the dormant mode or extend the life time of its dormant mode by way
   of a home registration, i.e. by sending a BU with Dormant Mode
   Request to its Home Agent. If time-slot based paging is used, the
   Dormant Mode Request extension contains the paging slot interval
   expressed as a multiple of advertisement intervals. MN sends the
   Paging Area ID in the Dormant Mode Request extension. The Paging Area
   ID value MUST be equal to the Paging Area ID advertised by the access
   router of the current cell of MN.

   When a MAP receives the Regional Binding Update with a Dormant Mode
   request extension, it establishes or updates its
   regional binding cache entry for the mobile node as in Hierarchical
   Mobile IPv6. When a MAP receives a Binding acknowledgement with a
   Dormant Mode reply extension, it deletes the binding cache associated
   with this MN if MAP is not a PMAP. MAPs do not maintain any tunnels
   or other routing information for dormant mode MNs in their routing
   tables.

   The Binding Update or Regional Binding Update with a Dormant Mode
   request extension has a lifetime. MN that wishes to stay in the
   dormant mode longer than this lifetime MUST extend the lifetime by
   performing another dormant mode registration. MN may also extend the
   lifetime of its home registration and yet stay in the dormant mode by
   performing a home registration with the Dormant Mode Request
   extension. Dormant mode extensions are transparent to HA, i.e. HA
   responds only to the life time extension of MN's home registration.

   PMAP includes a Dormant Mode Reply extension to the Regional Binding
   Acknowledgement. PMAP keeps the binding cache for MN and adds the
   Paging Area ID to the cache entry. The binding cache for the MN MUST
   contain the Paging Multicast Address as equal to the solicited node
   multicast address obtained from the home address of MN.

3.3. Paging
   When PMAP receives a packet from a correspondent node destined to a
   mobile node that has the dormant mode flag set in the binding cache,
   PMAP does not forward the packet to any lower MAP. Instead it sends a
   Paging Request IPv6 unicast message to the Paging Agent. PMAP sets
   the fields of paging request message as follows:
   In normal mode, the fields of paging slot index, interval and offset
   are not set. Paging multicast address is not set in all cases. Paged
   mobile node address field is filled from the binding cache as the
   home address of the destination mobile node of the packet received

Sarikaya,Xu, Choyi                      Expires January 2002        6

                   Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging          July 2001


   from correspondent node. If time-slot based paging is used in the
   paging area then the values required for determining the paging slot
   are copied from the binding cache.

   PA, after receiving Paging Request message from PMAP sends a Paging
   Request message to the access routers in the paging area the mobile
   node was last in. The access router which finds the dormant node MN
   sends a Paging Reply message to the Paging Agent. If no reply is
   received after a timeout period, PA starts paging in other paging
   areas until MN is found or else the paging fails.

   PA uses paging area multicast address as the destination address of
   the Paging Request message. PA determines which mode of paging to use.
   In normal paging mode, PA determines paging area ID of MN(s) (PAi)
   and then forwards the Paging Request message to the destination
   address PAMAi.

   PA receives a Paging Reply message from all access routers in the
   paging area. If Paged Mobile Node Address field is empty in any of
   the replies then the paging has successfullly located the dormant
   node MN. Otherwise PA should continue to page the MN in other paging
   areas.

   PA initiates paging in other paging areas by sending multicast paging
   request messages to the access routers. The order of paging areas in
   which the MN is to be paged is implementation specific.  PA receives
   the replies as described. After the paging process is complete, PA
   reports the result of paging in a Paging Reply message to PMAP to
   acknowledge the Paging Request Message and to report on the results.
   Paged mobile node address field of the Paging Reply message is empty
   if MN has been located. PMAP silently ignores any Paging Reply
   messages that report successful paging.

   If paged mobile node address field of the Paging Reply message is not
   empty, PMAP receives the address of MN for which paging failed in
   Paging Reply message. PMAP SHOULD send a Destination Unreachable
   ICMPv6 error message to the correspondent node(s).

   The access routers in the Paging Area send a Paging Router
   Advertisement to all dormant nodes multicast address. All dormant
   nodes multicast address is permanently assigned and is of link-local
   scope and is of the form:
   FF02::gid
   where gid is TBD. Paged mobile node address field of the paging
   router advertisement is assigned from the paging request message sent
   by PA. The address is the home addresses of dormant mode MN.

   Paging router advertisement triggers the paging of dormant node MN(s)
   using link layer paging. From the addresses in paged mobile node
   address field, it is possible to obtain the EUI-64 identifier for
   each MN and hence the link layer address of each MN is made known.



Sarikaya,Xu, Choyi                      Expires January 2002        7

                   Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging          July 2001


   After sending paging router advertisement, the access router starts a
   timer and at the end of the timer period a Paging Reply message is
   sent to Paging Agent. Paging Reply message contains in its Paged
   Mobile Node Address field the address of  MN that has not performed a
   registration, if any.

   The MN is expected to perform an ordinary binding update or an
   ordinary regional binding update in response to a Paging Router
   Advertisement. PMAP MAY transmit the Paging Request after a timeout
   to Paging Agent.

   While waiting for the response of MN, PMAP MAY buffer the data
   destined to MN. When MN has entered the active mode, PMAP can stop
   buffering and forward the buffered packets to MN. PMAP discards
   buffered packets after a timeout.

3.3.1 Time-slot Based Paging

   Paging agent decides which paging areas will support time-slot based
   paging and configures the access routers in those paging areas and
   informs PMAP. If the optional time slot based paging mechanism is
   used, the Dormant Mode Reply extension contains a paging slot index
   (an integer) and a paging slot offset (in milliseconds) which are
   used in determining the exact timing of paging. The paging slot
   instant is determined as follows: Paging slot occurs N milliseconds
   later than every paging slot interval number of unsolicited periodic
   router advertisements. The delay N equals paging slot index times
   advertisement interval plus paging slot offset. The paging slot
   interval times the Advertisement Interval is the period of Paging
   Router Advertisements and the paging slot index and paging slot
   offset specify the exact timing of the paging. For example, if paging
   slot interval is 4, paging slot index is 2 and paging slot offset is
   100 ms, then there will be a paging slot during every 0th, 4th, 8th,
   etc. unsolicited router advertisement and it will exactly occur 100
   ms after every 2nd, 6th, 10th, etc. router advertisement.

   The length (duration) of the paging slot is equal to the length of
   the advertisement slot. Since mobile nodes can not determine the
   exact instant of the paging slot, access routers do not send Paging
   Router Advertisements during the first and the last quarter of the
   paging slot.

   The sequence number field is needed in determining the paging slot.
   Thus the slot sequence number field is defined for this purpose.

   In time-slot based paging, if a single MN is to be paged then the
   solicited-node multicast address obtained from the home address of MN
   is used as the destination address.

   When time slot based paging is supported, the Paging Request contains
   the paging slot interval, the paging slot index, and the paging slot
   offset. Using these values the access routers in the paging area can


Sarikaya,Xu, Choyi                      Expires January 2002        8

                   Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging          July 2001


   generate periodic Paging Router Advertisements until MN enters the
   active mode.

   If time slot based paging is used, the access routers send the Paging
   Router Advertisements during the second and the third quarter of the
   MN's paging slot.

3.4. Entering Active Mode

   When MN receives a Paging Router Advertisement to its solicited-node
   multicast address that MN received with Binding Acknowledgement with
   Dormant Mode Reply extension, MN enters the active mode. MN can also
   enter active mode if it needs to send a packet.

   When entering the active mode, MN sends a home registration or a
   regional registration by sending a Binding Update MIPv6 destination
   option. This sets up the routing state in the MAPs of
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 [2]. This registration clears the dormant
   mode in PMAPÆs binding cache and allows all subsequent data to reach
   MN.

3.5. Dynamic PMAP Discovery

   Dynamic PMAP discovery is an extension to the Dynamic MAP discovery
   of Hierarchical MIPv6 [2]. As in [2], the access routers are required
   to send the MAP option in all router advertisements. MN selects the
   MAP whose distance is the highest as its current PMAP and stores the
   global IPv6 address of this MAP. When, in the subsequent router
   advertisements, another MAP with a distance greater than the current
   PMAP is advertised, MN replaces the current PMAP with the new highest
   distance PMAP. When going to the dormant mode, MN sends its Regional
   Registration message (Binding Update with Dormant Mode Request
   extension) to the current PMAP.

4. Protocol Extensions

4.1 Paging Area ID Extension

   Mobile IPv6 Router Advertisement messages may contain a Paging Area
   ID Extension.
   The Paging Area ID extension is defined as follows:

        TBD

   Length

        The length (in octets) of the Paging Area ID field. The length
        of the option (including the type and length fields) in units of
        8 octets. The value of this field must be 1.

   Paging Area ID

        A 32-bit identifier. The access router that supports regional
        paging indicates the support by including the Paging Area ID
        extension in the Router Advertisement message. If present, the
        Paging Area ID extension MUST appear in the Router Advertisement
        message after any of the advertisement extensions defined in
        [3].

4.2. Advertisement Interval Extension

   The base Mobile IPv6 protocol's Advertisement Interval option for
   Router Advertisement messages is extended to optionally include slot
   length and slot sequence number.

        8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including
        the type and length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value of
        this field MUST be 2.


   Slot Length

        16-bit unsigned integer. Indicates the length in milliseconds of
        the advertisement slot during which the mobile nodes activate
        their receivers in order to receive Paging Router
        Advertisements, if time slot based paging is supported. The
        router advertisement MUST also include a Paging Area ID
        extension if the Slot Length is non-zero. If this field is zero,

        it indicates that the Paging Area does not support time slot
        based paging.

   Advertisement Interval

        32-bit unsigned integer. The time in milliseconds (not the
        maximum time as in the base Mobile IPv6) between two successive
        unsolicited router advertisement messages sent by this access
        router on this network interface.

   Slot Sequence Number

        16-bit unsigned integer. This field is included if time slot
        based paging is supported. The slot sequence number in each
        unsolicited Router Advertisement is one greater than in the
        previous unsolicited Router Advertisement. The slot sequence
        number is used to determine mobile node's paging slot, as

   When paging a mobile node, the Paging Mobility Anchor Point sends a
   Paging Request Message which is a destination option to paging agent.
   The Paging Agent in turn sends paging request message to the access
   routers in a given paging area.
   Overall Message Structure for Paging Request Message is as follows:

     0    1    2    3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Paged Mobile Node Address

   Home address of the mobile node that was paged unsuccessfully.

4.7 Paged Mobile Node Address Extension

   The Paged Mobile Node Address extension is used for identifying the
   mobile node that is paged. When this extension is used as an option
   in a router advertisement the router advertisement is called a Paging
   Router Advertisement.

   The Paged Mobile Node address extension is defined as follows:

    0    1    2    3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

        sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Paged Mobile Node Address

        Home address of the MN that is the target of paging. There MAY
        not be more than one MN address in this field.


5. IANA Considerations

   MIPv6HP requires two new IPv6 destination options to be used for
   sending the Paging Request and paging reply messages (Section 4.5 and
   4.6).
   MIPv6HP requires 3 new extension types to be used in combination with
   router advertisements: a type for Advertisement Interval extension
   (Section 4.1), a type for Paging Area ID extension (Section 4.2), a
   type for Paged Mobile Node Address extension (Section 4.7).

   MIPv6HP requires two new types to be used in combination with the
   Binding Update or Binding Acknowledgement destination options: a type
   for the Dormant Mode Request extension (Section 4.3) and a type for
   the Dormant Mode Reply extension (Section 4.4).

   MIPV6HP requires a new multicast address called all dormant nodes
   multicast address as an extension to [6] (Section 3.3).

6. Security Considerations
   Security aspects of MIPv6HP is for further study.

7. Future Revisions

   Future versions of this document are expected to contain:
        Increased conformance to [3].
        Security aspects.
