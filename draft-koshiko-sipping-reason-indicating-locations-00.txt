Abstract

   This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to indicate the location of 
   the SIP element which issued a certain SIP message. This capability
   enables many enhanced services by providing the information as to how
   and why a SIP message arrives at a specific application, user, or
   proxy server. This draft defines new reason-params for the protocol
   field of the Reason header field in RFC3326 [1].

 1. Introduction
 
   The same SIP [1] message can be issued by different types of network
   element such as a UA, a proxy and the like. And with SIP[1], there 
   is nothing to indicate the type of the network element that has
   issued the message, so messages from the network elements of
   different types are treated as same ones.
 
   But some users or applications may desire to know the location of
   the network element that issued the message.  For example, if a uac
   received a 503 (Service Unavailable) message, which means that the
   server is temporarily unable to process the request due to a
   temporary overloading or maintenance of the server, it may choice
   the alternative server or route of a SIP message depending on the
   location (a proxy, a UA or the like) where the message has
   issued originally.
 
   As another example, when a UAS would receive a CANCEL request
   message and would stop session establishment, a user who uses a UAS
   may desire to know that the session closing was performed by a UAC,
   a proxy, or a non-ip based network inter-worked through a SIP
   gateway.
 
   To meet this demand, this document proposes the an IANA
   Registration extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Reason Header and defines new protocol params, reason-location and
   reason-domain. 
 
 2. Terminology
 
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
   RFC 2119 [2] and indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP
   implementations.

 3. Message Source Indication

   This document defines the following new reason-params value as a
   reason-extension for the protocol field of the Reason header field
   in RFC 3326 [1]. You may use this extension parameters combining
   with reason-params, or use only this extension independently on
   reason-params prescribed by RFC3326.

   RFC3326 [1] defines Reason-Header field as following:

 Reason            =  "Reason" HCOLON reason-value *(COMMA reason-value)
 reason-value      =  protocol *(SEMI reason-params)
 protocol          =  "SIP" / "Q.850" / token
 reason-params     =  protocol-cause / reason-text
                      / reason-extension
 protocol-cause    =  "cause" EQUAL cause
 cause             =  1*DIGIT
 reason-text       =  "text" EQUAL quoted-string
 reason-extension  =  generic-param
 
   This document defines two reason-params (reason-location, 
   reason-domain). BNF definition is as followings:

 reason-params    =  reason-location / reason-domain
 reason-location  =  "location" EQUAL location-params
 location-params  =  "uac" / "uas" / "proxy" / "non-ip"
                     / q.850-location-params
 reason-domain    =  "domain" EQUAL host
 host             =  hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
 hostname         =  *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
 domainlabel      =  alphanum
                    / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
 toplabel         =  ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
 
   This fields would be used in order to indicate the location of the
   SIP element which issued the SIP message. Reason-location parameter
   means the type of network element which issued the SIP message. As
   location-params, "uac", "uas", "proxy", "non-ip",
   q.850-location-params have been defined. Q.850-location-params means
   location parameter field value defined by ITU-T Q.850 [5].
   Especially, if the reason-protocol value is "Q.850", location
   parameters SHOULD be of location parameters defined by ITU-T Q.850.
 
   The following values for location field have been defined:

  Location-params         Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "uac"                 This value indicate that the message has been
                          issued by a user agent client.

    "uas"                 This value indicate that the message has been
                          issued by a user agent server.

   "proxy"                This value indicate that the message has been

Internet Draft  Reason Header for Location Indication    Oct 18th, 2004

                          issued by a proxy server.

   "non-ip"               The message has been issued by a SIP gateway
                          because it had received message by a Non-IP
                          based network inter-working through a SIP
                          gateway.
 
 q.850-location-params    This message has been issued on a location 
                          which is indicated by location-parameter
                          defined by ITU-T Q.850 [5]. Meanings of each
                          location-parameter values follows the
                          description of ITU-T Q.850 [5].
 
   The reason-domain parameter is for indicating the domain name to
   which network element belongs. It is a optional parameter. You MAY
   use it with a reason-location parameter or not.

   Example syntax is as follows:

      Reason: SIP ; location="uac"
      Reason: SIP ; location="uas" ;domain="pc22.biloxi.example"
      Reason: SIP ; cause=503 ;text="Service Unavailable"
       ;location="proxy" ;domain="biloxi.example"
      Reason: SIP ; cause=408 ;text="Request Timeout"
       ;location="non-ip" ;domain="gw.atlanta.example"
 
   Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provide uses cases and extended definitions
   for the above four cause codes with message flow diagrams.
 
 3.1 Example1: Location Indication of a 503 Message
 
   In this section, the example of location indication of a 503 service
   unavailable message has been described.
 
   A 503 response message means that a service is unavailable because
   of a temporary overload or a maintenance on a certain network
   element. And RFC3261[1] says that a client (proxy or UAC)
   receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) SHOULD attempt to forward the
   request to an alternate server.
   
   In such a case, the client may desire to recognize where the
   temporary overload or a maintenance occers when it decides the
   substitute destination to which it attempt to re-transmit the
   request.
 
   Reason-parameter extension of the Reason Header proposed in this
   document assumes using in such cases. A network element which issued
   the 503 response message would indicate the location on the
   reason-location field and the domain name on the reason-domain
   field, and the client would know the location where the temporary
   overload or the maintenance has occured alerted by the 503 response
   message.

Internet Draft  Reason Header for Location Indication    Oct 18th, 2004
 
   In the followings, we'll consider about the example of the SIP
   network consist of two proxy servers (atlanta.example, biloxi.example) and
   two UAs (alice, bob).
 
 3.1.1 A 503 response messages from a proxy server
 
   A 503 response message for an INVITE may be issued by the proxy.
   In the 503 response messages, "proxy" is set on reason-location
   parameter field value, which means the message is issued by a proxy
   server.
 
   As previously assumed, on the network which includes more than one
   proxy servers, you may write the domain name, which indicates a
   certain proxy server, as a reason-domain parameter field value on the
   Reason Header. 
 
   In the following example, in order to distinguish the 503 response
   message gerenated by atlanta.example, and the one generated by biloxi.example,
   the value of a reason-domain paramter value is changed. It is the 503
   response messages from proxy server with the domain name of
   atlanta.example that the value of a domain parameter is "atlanta.example",
   and it means that a temporary overload or a maintenance have occurred
   in proxy server of atlanta.example. (See the following figure 3.1) 
 

   UAC           Proxy          Proxy           UAS

    |------------->|              |              |
    | 503 Service Unavailable     |              |
    | Reason: SIP cause=503 ;text="Service Unavailable"
    | ;location="proxy"; domain="atlanta.example"    |
    |<-------------|              |              |
    |              |              |              |
 
    figure3.1 A 503 response message from proxy (atlanta.example)
 
   Moreover, if the value of a domain parameter is "biloxi.example", it
   means that the message has issued by a proxy of which domain name
   is biloxi.example. In this case, an temporary overload or a maintenance
   have occurred at biloxi.example and the service is not available.
   (See the following figure 3.2)

    figure3.2 A 503 response message from proxy (biloxi.example)
 
    A value of a reason-domain parameter field would be decided
    depending on a local policy. Number of proxy servers MAY
    set the same value on a reason-domain parameter field.
 
 3.1.2 A 503 response messages from a UAS
 
   A 503 response message for an INVITE may be issued by a user agent
   server (UAS). In the 503 response messages, "uas" is set on
   reason-location parameter field value, which means the message is
   issued by a UAS. (See the following figure3.3)
 
   You would get to know that there is no meaning in trying in order
   that the client which received these 503 response messages may
   reach this UAS via another relay proxy server as substitution.

   Moreover, consider the case where a UAS acts as gateway to
   inter-work with network on another protocol. In the case that the
   temporary overload occured on the network on another protocol,
   the flow would be as the following figure.(See the following
   figure 3.4) Here, the domain of a gateway assumed to be
   "gw.biloxi.example"
 
   By this message, a UAC will know that an overload or a maintenance
   will be performed with a non-ip element. When a client performs
   access to substitute service, it may choose a path in consideration
   of being accessed to a different non-ip element.

  ü@  figure 3.4 A 503 response message from a gateway
 3.2 Example2: Location Indication of a CANCEL request message
 
   In this section, the example of location indication of a CANCEL
   request message has been described.

   In a Proxy server or UAS, when a timer (for example, timer C) is
   completed, a CANCEL message may be published and a session may
   be terminated. And these CANCEL messages may be issued by both
   UACs and proxy servers. The new parameter of a Reason header
   enables it to indicate the location of message source.

 3.2.1 A CANCEL request messages from a proxy server

   A CANCEL message may be issued by the proxy server. In a CANCEL
   message, if the value of the location parameter by Reason header
   extension is "proxy", it would indicate that the message is issued
   by a proxy server.

   As previously assumed, on the network which includes more than one
   proxy servers, you may write the domain name, which indicates a
   certain proxy server, as a reason-domain parameter field value on the
   Reason Header.
 
   In the following example, in order to distinguish the CANCEL request
   message issued by atlanta.example, and the one issued by biloxi.example, the
   value of a reason-domain paramter value is changed. It is the 503
   response messages from proxy server with the domain name of
   atlanta.example that the value of a domain parameter is "atlanta.example",
   and it means that a timeout or user cancelation have occurred
   on proxy server of atlanta.example. (See the following figure 3.5)

 4. Security Consideration

   Establishment of a session may be impossible if an unexpected change
   is made to the contents of the Reason header or an unsuitable value
   is set with malicious intent as them by spoofing. It is RECOMMENDED 
   that the contents of the Reason header would be secured by a certain
   mechanism.

 5. IANA Consideration
