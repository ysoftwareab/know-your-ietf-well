Internet-Draft          ECC Support for SEND/CGA                Oct 2008


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This draft follows the terminology that has been defined in [RFC3971]
   and [RFC3972].  In addition, this draft uses the following terms:

   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)  A public-key cryptosystem based on
      the properties of elliptic curves over finite fields.  The
      operations relevant for this work are digital signature derivation
      and verification.

   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)  A standard
      digital signature algorithm based on ECC.


2.  Background

   The Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol [RFC3971] was designed
   out of a need to secure IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages against
   spoofing of addresses, in an effort to guard against several attacks,
   notably Denial of Service attacks.  The neighbor discovery problem
   lends itself to the use of public key cryptosystems.

   At the time when SEND was designed the public key cryptosystem of
   choice was RSA-based, due to its widespread use, availability of
   implementation, etc.  At about the same time [RFC3971] was published,
   the National Security Agency (NSA) announced the incorporation of ECC
   in its set of recommended algorithms for modern use ("Suite B").


3.  Motivation

   Since the publication of SEND, the Internet has witnessed several
   trends: On the one hand, some existing protocols have been upgraded
   to support elliptic curve cryptography -- for example TLS (see
   [RFC4492] ), and IKE/IKEv2 (see [RFC4754]).  On the other hand, those
   interested in maintaining protocols based on RSA are inclined to heed
   the cryptographic community's (e.g.  NIST) recommendation to
   deprecate 1024-bit RSA algorithms by the year 2010, in favor of
   longer keys or else alternate algorithms.  Finally, an increasing
   number of power or memory-limited devices have joined the Internet,
   and to them the computational burden of RSA-based protocols is
   undesirable.

   The efficiency of ECC is well-known, since it provides similar

Internet-Draft          ECC Support for SEND/CGA                Oct 2008


   cryptographic strength as RSA but uses shorter keys.  For example,
   ECC with a 256-bit key size provides similar strength to RSA with a
   3072-bit key size (see [NIST-800-57]).  As the key size increases,
   this difference grows must faster than linearly.

   It should be clarified that this document does not intend to make the
   strength of the ECC signature match that of the currently specified
   in [RFC3971] RSA signature; RSA algorithms based on 1024 bit keys
   provide similar cryptographic strength to ECC algorithms that use 163
   bit keys, but 163 bit keys are not widely used, nor recommended for
   ECC.  Instead, we recommend that the default key length for ECDSA be
   set to 192 bits, and other acceptable key lengths being set to 256
   and 521 bits.

   Given the well-known strength and relatively low computational cost
   for ECC-based signature generation/verification, it is then
   imperative for the SEND/CGA protocols to also allow an option to
   employ ECC.


4.  New NDP Options

   The SEND protocol calls for the use of the "CGA option" to secure its
   messages.  This option contains a field of "CGA parameters", which is
   taken from the CGA specification.  Therefore, the CGA option of SEND
   does not need modification in order for SEND to support ECC-based
   options.  However, the CGA specification ([RFC3972]) does and it will
   be addressed in Section 5.

   The SEND protocol calls for the use of public key cryptography in the
   construction and validation of the "RSA signature option".  This
   option is required in order to validate that the CGA parameters data
   structure present in the "CGA option" was actually generated by the
   owner of the public key present in the CGA parameters list.
   Therefore, the SEND protocol needs to be updated to support an "ECC
   signature option".

4.1.  ECC signature option

   The ECC Signature option is very similar to the RSA Signature option.
   The ECC Signature option allows public key-based signatures to be
   attached to NDP messages.  The format of the ECC Signature option is
   described in the following diagram:

   Length

      8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including the
      Type, Length, Reserved, Key Hash, Digital Signature, and Padding
      fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value 0 is invalid.

      A 16-bit field reserved for future use.  The value MUST be
      initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

   Key hash

      A 128-bit field containing the most significant (leftmost) 128
      bits of a SHA-256 [FIPS.180-2] hash of the public key used for
      constructing the signature.  The SHA-256 hash is taken over the

      associate the signature with a particular key known by the
      receiver.  Such a key can either be stored in the certificate
      cache of the receiver or be received in the CGA option in the same
      message.

   Digital Signature

      A variable-length field containing a ECDSA as defined in [SEC1],
      constructed by using the sender's private key over the following
      sequence of octets:

             The 128-bit CGA Message Type tag [RFC3972] value for SEND,
             specified in section 5.2 of [RFC3972];

             The 128-bit Source Address field from the IP header;

             The 128-bit Destination Address field from the IP header;

             The 8-bit Type, 8-bit Code, and 16-bit Checksum fields from
             the ICMP header;

             The NDP message header, starting from the octet after the
             ICMP Checksum field and continuing up to but not including
             NDP options;

             All NDP options preceding the ECC Signature option.

      The signature value is computed as defined in [SEC1].  The length
      of the Digital Signature field is determined by the length of the
      ECC Signature option minus the length of the other fields
      (including the variable length Padding field).

   Padding

      This variable-length field contains padding, as many bytes long as
      remain after the end of the signature, so that the total length is
      a multiple of 8 octets.


5.  New CGA parameters specification

   The ECDSA signature should be calculated via the algorithm defined in
   [SEC1] or other compatible standards ([FIPS.186-3], [ANSI-X962]).

5.1.  New CGA Parameter Data Structure

   The new CGA parameters data structure associated with ECC has the
   following format:

   Modifier

      This field contains a 128-bit unsigned integer, which can be any
      value.  The modifier is used during CGA generation to implement
      the hash extension and to enhance privacy by adding randomness to
      the address.

   Subnet Prefix

      This field contains the 64-bit subnet prefix of the CGA.

   Collision Count

      This is an eight-bit unsigned integer that MUST be 0, 1, or 2.
      The collision count is incremented during CGA generation to
      recover from an address collision detected by duplicate address
      detection.

   Public Key

      This is a variable-length field containing the public key of the
      address owner.  The public key MUST be formatted as a DER-encoded

      [ITU-X690-2002] ASN.1 structure of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
      defined in [SEC1].

   Extension Fields

      This is an optional variable-length field that is not used in the
      current specification.

5.2.  ECC recommended parameters

   As specified by [RFC3971] and [RFC3972], all nodes that support the
   verification of the CGA option MUST record a minimum acceptable key
   length for RSA public keys.  The default RSA key length SHOULD be
   1024 bits.  Implementations MAY also set an upper limit for the
   amount of computation needed when verifying packets that use these
   security associations.  The upper limit SHOULD be at least 2048 bits.
   Meanwhile, the minimum RSA key length for SEND is required to be 384
   bits.

   The key size of ECDSA used in SEND and CGA SHOULD be 192, 256 or 521;
   the default key size is 192-bit.  As indicated in [NIST-800-57], ECC
   with a 256-bit key size provides similar strength to RSA with a 3072-
   bit key size, while ECC with a 192-bit key size provides higher
   strength than RSA with 1024-bit size.  Hence ECDSA with at least 192-
   bit key size will provide security strength no less than the RSA
   signature defined SEND/CGA.

   To ensure interoperability, we recommend a few widely used curves to
   narrow the set.  We recommend three curves with above-mentioned key
   sizes (from [FIPS.186-3]): P-192, P-256 and P-521.


6.  Compatibility Issues

   To ensure backward compatibility, and pave the way to
   interoperability between new and old implementations, the RSA
   signature SHOULD be the default for both CGA and SEND.  ECDSA support
   in CGA and SEND is OPTIONAL.

   The negotiation of the PKI algorithms -- RSA, ECDSA ---to be used in
   CGA and SEND between two network nodes is outside the scope of this
   draft.  It is expected that future versions of the SEND protocol will
   specify the negotiation process and sender/receiver's action.  It is
   expected that the PKI algorithm agility scheme is not only dealing
   with the choice between RSA and ECDSA, but also aiming to be a
   general scheme dealing with all possible PKI algorithms.

Internet-Draft          ECC Support for SEND/CGA                Oct 2008


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations relating to CGAs are also applicable
   here.  They are outlined in [RFC3971].

   As discussed in section 5, ECDSA signatures provide increased
   security strength given the same key size compared to RSA signature.

   It should be clarified that ECDSA signatures do not provide any
   additional security features compared to RSA signatures, when used in
   the context of CGA/SEND as discussed above.

7.1.  Hash Function in ECDSA

   Both CGA and SEND specify SHA-1 as the hash function used in address
   computation and respectively digital signature.  The cryptography
   community no longer recommends the use of SHA-1 for new security
   protocols.  According to [NIST-800-57], SHA-256 should be used with
   ECDSA of 256 key size.

   NIST intends to deprecate or at least replace the SHA-256 variants
   with a new hash function, SHA-3.  The new hash function is not
   expected to be standardized until 2012.

   Since the proposed changes to CGA/SEND rely on existing ECDSA
   standards, and these standards all make use of SHA-1, this document
   does not upgrade the hash function.  In the future, however, the CGA/
   SEND specifications should be updated to keep up with the new NIST
   standards.

   Part of work on agility of Hash function in SEND and CGA has been
   done [RFC4982] and more related work is in process in CSI Working
   Group.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one new Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC4861]
   option, which must be assigned Option Type values within the option
   numbering space for Neighbor Discovery Protocol messages, i.e. the
   IANA registry "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats":

      The ECC Signature option (31), described in Section 4.1.
