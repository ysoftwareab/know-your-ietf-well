Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it provides a common data and format representation 
   for PacketCable and IPCablecom compliant Multimedia Terminal Adapter 
   devices. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to 
   the SNMP SMIv2.  The set of objects are consistent with the SNMP 
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB  
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL", when used in the guidelines in this memo, are to be 
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
   The terms "MIB module" and "information module" are used 
   interchangeably in this memo.  As used here, both terms refer to any 
   of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578]. 
    
2.1 MTA

PacketCable/IPCablecom NCS Signaling MIB                  October 2003 
 
 
   A Multimedia Terminal Adapter is a PacketCable or IPCablecom 
   compliant device providing telephony services over a cable or hybrid 
   system used to deliver video signals to a community. It contains an 
   interface to endpoints, a network interface, CODECs, and all 
   signaling and encapsulation functions required for Voice over IP 
   transport, call signaling, and Quality of Service signaling. A MTA 
   can be an embedded or a standalone device. An Embedded MTA (E-MTA) 
   is a MTA device containing an embedded DOCSIS Cable Modem. A 
   Standalone MTA (S-MTA) is a MTA device separated from the DOCSIS 
   Cable Modem by non-DOCSIS MAC interface (e.g., Ethernet, USB). 
    
2.2 Endpoint 
    
   An endpoint or MTA endpoint is a standard RJ-11 telephony physical 
   port located on the MTA and used for attaching the telephone device 
   to the MTA. 
    
3. Overview 
    
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for Signaling 
   PacketCable and IPCablecom compliant Multimedia Terminal Adapter 
   (MTA) devices. MTA devices include one or more endpoints (e.g., 
   telephone ports) which receive signaling information to establish 
   ring cadence, and codecs used for providing telephony service. 
    
   Telephone systems are typically very complex and often have a wide 
   distribution. It is therefore important for management systems to 
   support MTAs from multiple vendors at the same time, including those 
   from multiple countries. This MIB module provides objects suitable 
   for managing signaling for MTA devices in the widest possible 
   variety of marketplaces. 
    
   Several normative and informative references are used to help define 
   NCS Signaling MIB objects. As a convention, in the object REFERENCE 
   clauses, we use the PacketCable reference. IPCablecom compliant MTA 
   devices MUST use the equivalent IPCablecom references. 
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB is identified by pktcSigMib and is structured in three 
   groups: 
    
   - Signaling information that control device and endpoint 
   configuration objects (pktcSigMibObjects) 
    
   - Signaling Notification object, that notifies the status 
   (pktcSigNotification)

8. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   The following Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) and mask 
   objects are used to differentiate between various types of traffic 
   in the service provider network: 
    
        pktcSigDefCallSigDscp 
        pktcSigDefMediaStreamDscp 
        pktcSigServiceClassNameMask 
    
   These objects may contain information that may be sensitive from a 
   business perspective. For example, they may represent a customer's 
   service contract that a service provider chooses to apply to a 
 
 
Beacham/Kumar/Channabasappa Expires - April 2004             [Page 54] 











PacketCable/IPCablecom NCS Signaling MIB                  October 2003 
 
 
   customer's ingress or egress traffic. If these objects are SET 
   maliciously, it may permit unmarked or inappropriately marked 
   signaling and media traffic to enter the service provider network, 
   resulting in unauthorized levels of service for customers. 
    
   The following objects determine ring cadence, repeatable 
   characteristics, signal duration, and caller id subscriber line 
   protocol for telephony operation: 
    
        pktcSigDevR0Cadence 
        pktcSigDevR1Cadence 
        pktcSigDevR2Cadence 
        pktcSigDevR3Cadence 
        pktcSigDevR4Cadence 
        pktcSigDevR5Cadence 
        pktcSigDevR6Cadence 
        pktcSigDevR7Cadence 
        pktcSigDevRgCadence 
        pktcSigDevRsCadence 
        pktcSigDevRtCadence 
        pktcSigDevCallerIdSigProtocol 
        pktcSigPulseSignalDuration 
        pktcSigPulseSignalPauseDuration 
    
   If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in unwanted 
   operation, or a failure to obtain telephony service from client 
   (MTA) devices. 
    
   The objects in the pktcNcsEndPntConfigTable are used for end point 
   signaling. The pktcNcsEndPntConfigCallAgentId object contains the 
   name of the call agent, which includes the call agent FQDN. If this 
   object is SET maliciously, the MTA will not be able to communicate 
   with the call agent, resulting in a disruption of telephony service. 
   The pktcNcsEndPntConfigCallAgentUdpPort object identifies the UDP 
   port for NCS signaling traffic. If this object is SET maliciously, 
   the call agent will not receive NCS signaling traffic from the MTA, 
   also resulting in a disruption of telephony service. 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with 
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP.  The most sensitive is 
   pktcNcsEndPntStatusCallIpAddress within pktcNcsEndPntConfigTable. 
   This information itself may be valuable to would-be attackers. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
 
 
Beacham/Kumar/Channabasappa Expires - April 2004             [Page 55] 











PacketCable/IPCablecom NCS Signaling MIB                  October 2003 
 
 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
