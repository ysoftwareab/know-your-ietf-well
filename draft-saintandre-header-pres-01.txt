Abstract

   This document defines a header field that enables the author of an
   email or netnews message to include a Presence URI in the message
   header block for the purpose of associating the author with an
   address that provides information about network availability, also
   known as "presence".

Internet-Draft                 Presence-ID                 November 2007


1.  Introduction

   Several technologies enable entities to share information about their
   network availability, also known as "presence" [IMP-REQS].  Such
   technologies include the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   [XMPP-IM] and the Session Initiation Protocol [SIP-PRES].  To
   facilitate the exchange of presence information, a URI scheme for
   presence is defined in [CPP].

   Because almost all human users of presence systems also use email
   systems and because many such users also use netnews systems, it can
   be helpful for such users to specify their presence URIs in the
   messages they author.  The Presence-ID header field provides a
   standard location for such information.  This document documents the
   syntax and implementation of the Presence-ID header field, including
   the information necessary to register it in the Permanent Message
   Header Field Registry maintained by the IANA.


2.  Syntax

   The syntax of the Presence-ID header field is defined below using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (as specified by [ABNF]), where the "PRES-
   URI" rule is defined in [CPP] and the remaining rules are defined in
   [MESSAGE]:

   "Presence-ID:" [FWS] PRES-URI *WSP CRLF


3.  Implementation

3.1.  Inclusion

   The Presence-ID header field is associated with the author of the
   message; see [MESSAGE].  If the "From:" header field contains more
   than one mailbox, the Presence-ID header field should not be added to
   the message.  There should be no more than one instance of the
   Presence-ID header field.

3.2.  Generation

   For a user whose presence URI is "pres:juliet@example.com", the
   corresponding Presence-ID header field would be:

   Presence-ID: pres:juliet@example.com

3.3.  Processing

   Upon receiving a message containing a Presence-ID header field, a
   user agent that supports the field should process the field by
   resolving the presence URI in accordance with the procedures
   specified in [CPP].

3.4.  Disposition

   A user agent that has processed a Presence-ID header field may
   provide appropriate interface elements if it has independent
   information linking the author of the message with the specified
   presence URI (e.g., via a user-controlled address book or automated
   directory lookup).  If the user is subscribed to the presence of the
   author, such interface elements might include an indicator that the
   author is online and available for communication over a network.


4.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with [REG], the IANA registers the "Presence-ID" header
   field in the Permanent Message Header Field Registry.  The
   registration template is as follows:

   Header field name:  Presence-ID
   Applicable protocol:  mail, netnews
   Status:  permanent
   Author/Change controller:  Peter Saint-Andre
      <mailto:stpeter@jabber.org>
   Specification document(s):  draft-saintandre-header-pres-00 [Note to
      IANA and RFC Editor: Replace I-D name with RFC XXXX, where "XXXX"
      is the number of the RFC that results from this specification, if
      any]
   Related information:  For detail information regarding presence URIs,
      refer to RFC 3859.


5.  Security Considerations

   Message headers are an existing standard and are designed to easily
   accommodate new types.  Although the Presence-ID header field may be
   forged, this problem is inherent in Internet email; however, because
   a forged Presence-ID header field may break automated processing,
   applications should not depend on the Presence-ID header field to
   indicate the authenticity of an email message or the identity of its
   author or sender.  Including the Presence-ID header field among the
   signer header fields in DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) can help to
   mitigate against forging of the header (see [DKIMSIG]).

   Advertising presence URIs in message headers may make it easier for
   malicious users to harvest such URIs and therefore to send
   unsolicited bulk communications to the users or applications
   represented by those URIs.  Care should be taken in balancing the
   benefits of open information exchange against the potential costs of
   unwanted communication.  An email user agent that is capable of
   including the Presence-ID header field in outgoing email messages
   should provide an option for its user to disable inclusion of the
   Presence-ID header field generally, on a per-recipient basis, and on
   a per-message basis.

   The security considerations discussed in [URI] and [CPP] may also
   apply to the Presence-ID message header.
