1.  Introduction

   [RFC8949] defines a number of CBOR Tags for common items.  Tags 260
   and 261 were later defined in drafts listed with IANA
   [IANA.cbor-tags].  These tags were intended to cover addresses (260)
   and prefixes (261).  Tag 260 distinguishes between IPv6, IPv4, and
   MAC [RFC7042] addresses only through the length of the byte string
   making it impossible, for example, to drop trailing zeros in the
   encoding of IP addresses.  Tag 261 was not documented well enough for
   use.

Internet-Draft                   CBOR-IP                    October 2021


   This specification defines tags 54 and 52 achieving an explicit
   indication of IPv6 or IPv4 by the tag number.  These new tags are
   intended to be used in preference to tags 260 and 261.  They provide
   formats for IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, prefixes, and addresses with
   prefixes, achieving an explicit indication of IPv6 or IPv4.  The
   prefix format omits trailing zeroes in the address part.  (Due to the
   complexity of testing, the value of omitting trailing zeros for the
   pure address format was considered non-essential and support for that
   is not provided in this specification.)  This specification does not
   deal with 6- or 8-byte Ethernet addresses.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol

3.1.  Three Forms

3.1.1.  Addresses

   These tags can be applied to byte strings to represent a single
   address.

   This form is called the Address Format.

3.1.2.  Prefixes

   When applied to an array that starts with an unsigned integer, they
   represent a CIDR-style prefix of that length.

   When the Address Format (i.e., without prefix) appears in a context
   where a prefix is expected, then it is to be assumed that all bits
   are relevant.  That is, for IPv4, a /32 is implied, and for IPv6, a
   /128 is implied.

   This form is called the Prefix Format.

Internet-Draft                   CBOR-IP                    October 2021


3.1.3.  Interface Definition

   When applied to an array that starts with a byte string, which stands
   for an IP address, followed by an unsigned integer giving the bit
   length of a prefix built out of the first length bits of the address,
   they represent information that is commonly used to specify both the
   network prefix and the IP address of an interface.

   The length of the byte string is always 16 bytes (for IPv6) and 4
   bytes (for IPv4).

   This form is called the Interface Format.

   Interface Format definitions support an optional third element to the
   array, which is to be used as the IPv6 Link-Local interface
   identifier Section 4 of [RFC3542].  This may be an integer, in which
   case it is to be interpreted as the interface index.  This may be a
   string, in which case it is to be interpreted as an interface name.

   In the cases where the Interface Format is being used to represent
   only an address with an interface identifier, and no interface prefix
   information, then the prefix length may be replaced with the CBOR
   "false" (0xF4).

3.2.  IPv6

   IANA has allocated tag 54 for IPv6 uses.  (This is the ASCII code for
   '6'.)

   An IPv6 address is to be encoded as a sixteen-byte byte string
   (Section 3.1 of [RFC8949], major type 2), enclosed in Tag number 54.

   For example:

   54(h'20010db81234deedbeefcafefacefeed')

   An IPv6 prefix, such as 2001:db8:1234::/48 is to be encoded as a two
   element array, with the length of the prefix first.  Trailing zero
   bytes MUST be omitted.

   For example:

   54([48, h'20010db81234'])

   An IPv6 address combined with a prefix length, such as being used for
   configuring an interface, is to be encoded as a two element array,
   with the (full-length) IPv6 address first and the length of the
   associated network the prefix next.

Internet-Draft                   CBOR-IP                    October 2021


   For example:

   54([h'20010db81234deedbeefcafefacefeed', 56])

   The address-with-prefix form can be reliably distinguished from the
   prefix form only in the sequence of the array elements.

   Some example of a link-local IPv6 address with a 64-bit prefix:

   54([h'fe8000000000020202fffffffe030303', 64, 'eth0'])

   with a numeric interface identifier:

   54([h'fe8000000000020202fffffffe030303', 64, 42])

   An IPv6 link-local address without a prefix length:

   54([h'fe8000000000020202fffffffe030303', false, 42])

   Interface identifiers may be used with any kind of IPv6 address, not
   just Link-Local addresses.  In particular, they are valid for
   multicast addresses, and there may still be some significance for
   Globally Unique Addresses (GUA).

3.3.  IPv4

   IANA has allocated tag 52 for IPv4 uses.  (This is the ASCII code for
   '4'.)

   An IPv4 address is to be encoded as a four-byte byte string
   (Section 3.1 of [RFC8949], major type 2), enclosed in Tag number 52.

   For example:

   52(h'c0000201')

   An IPv4 prefix, such as 192.0.2.0/24 is to be encoded as a two
   element array, with the length of the prefix first.  Trailing zero
   bytes MUST be omitted.

   For example:

   52([24, h'c00002'])

   An IPv4 address combined with a prefix length, such as being used for
   configuring an interface, is to be encoded as a two element array,
   with the (full-length) IPv4 address first and the length of the
   associated network the prefix next.

Internet-Draft                   CBOR-IP                    October 2021


   For example, 192.0.2.1/24 is to be encoded as a two element array,
   with the length of the prefix (implied 192.0.2.0/24) last.

   52([h'c0000201', 24])

   The address-with-prefix form can be reliably distinguished from the
   prefix form only in the sequence of the array elements.

4.  Encoder Considerations for Prefixes

   For the byte strings used in representing prefixes, an encoder MUST
   omit any right-aligned (trailing) sequence of bytes that are all
   zero.

   There is no relationship between the number of bytes omitted and the
   prefix length.  For instance, the prefix 2001:db8::/64 is encoded as:

   54([64, h'20010db8'])

   An encoder MUST take care to set all trailing bits in the final byte
   to zero, if any.  While decoders are expected to ignore them, such
   garbage entities could be used as a covert channel, or may reveal the
   state of what would otherwise be private memory contents.  So for
   example, 2001:db8:1230::/44 MUST be encoded as:

   52([44, h'20010db81230'])

   even though variations like:

   54([44, h'20010db81233'])
   54([45, h'20010db8123f'])

   would be parsed in the exact same way; they MUST be considered
   invalid.

   The same considerations apply to IPv4 prefixes.

5.  Decoder Considerations for Prefixes

   A decoder MUST consider all bits to the right of the prefix length to
   be zero.

   A decoder MUST handle the case where a prefix length specifies that
   more bits are relevant than are actually present in the byte-string.
   As a pathological case, ::/128 can be encoded as

   54([128, h''])

   A recommendation for implementations is to first create an array of
   16 (or 4) zero bytes.

   Then taking whichever is smaller between (a) the length of the
   included byte-string, and (b) the number of bytes covered by the
   prefix-length rounded up to the next multiple of 8: fail if that
   number is greater than 16 (or 4), and then copy that many bytes from
   the byte-string into the array.

   Finally, looking at the last three bits of the prefix-length in bits
   (that is, the prefix-length modulo 8), use a static array of 8 values
   to force the lower, non-relevant bits to zero, or simply:

   unused_bits = (8 - (prefix_length_in_bits & 7)) % 8;
   if (length_in_bytes > 0)
     address_bytes[length_in_bytes - 1] &= (0xFF << unused_bits);

   A particularly paranoid decoder could examine the lower non-relevant
   bits to determine if they are non-zero, and reject the prefix.  This
   would detect non-compliant encoders, or a possible covert channel.

   if (length_in_bytes > 0 &&
       (address_bytes[length_in_bytes - 1] & ~(0xFF << unused_bits))
       != 0)
     fail();

6.  CDDL

   For use with CDDL [RFC8610], the typenames defined in Figure 1 are
   recommended:

   ipv6-interface-identifier = uint / tstr

7.  Security Considerations

   This document provides an CBOR encoding for IPv4 and IPv6 address
   information.  Any applications using these encodings will need to
   consider the security implications of this data in their specific
   context.  For example, identifying which byte sequences in a protocol
   are addresses may allow an attacker or eavesdropper to better
   understand what parts of a packet to attack.

   The right-hand bits of the prefix, after the prefix-length, are
   ignored by this protocol.  A malicious party could use them to
   transmit covert data in a way that would not affect the primary use
   of this encoding.  Such abuse would be detected by examination of the
   raw protocol bytes.  Users of this encoding should be aware of this
   possibility.

Internet-Draft                   CBOR-IP                    October 2021


   There are many ways in which the encodings may be invalid: wrong byte
   lengths (too long, too short), or invalid prefix lengths (greater
   than 32 for IPv4, greater than 128 for IPv6, negative values, etc.)
   These are all invalid and this error needs to be signaled to the
   application, and the entire content thrown away.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated two tags from the Specification Required area of
   the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags
   [IANA.cbor-tags]:

8.1.  Tag 54 - IPv6

   Data Item: byte string or array
   Semantics: IPv6, [prefixlen,IPv6], [IPv6,prefixpart]

8.2.  Tag 52 - IPv4

   Data Item: byte string or array
   Semantics: IPv4, [prefixlen,IPv4], [IPv4,prefixpart]

8.3.  Tags 260 and 261

   IANA is requested to add the note "DEPRECATED in favor of 52 and 54
   for IP addresses" to registrations 260 and 261
