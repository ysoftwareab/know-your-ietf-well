 Abstract  
     

    This document proposes a "two-plane three-tier" framework structure 
    for NSIS signaling. In this framework the Access Networks are 
    connected with wired backbone through default routers. It is 
    assumed that one can do a competent job of network configuration & 
    provisioning in the backbone network, and just keeps backbone

    networks stupid simple.Resource policies which are implemented in 
    inter-NSIS Domains and intra-NSIS Domain, NSIS Signaling and NSIS 
    negotiations are in the control plane. User data is transported in 
    the transport plane. COPS/Diameter is used for exchanging resource 
    policies.  

    Three-Tier NSIS signalings mean that NSIS signaling should be done 
    in three levels. The first level is Inter-NSIS Domain NSIS 
    signaling across neighboring NSIS Domains, and the second level is 
    Intra-NSIS Domain NSIS signaling inside each NSIS Domain while the 
    third level is end-to-edge NSIS signaling and end-to-end NSIS 
    signaling. The aggregate traffic crossing NSIS Domain borders is 
    served according to relatively stable, long-lived bilateral 
    agreements. End-to-end QoS support is achieved through the 
    concatenation of such bilateral agreements.

 1. Introduction 
         

    The current wisdom is that the existing circuit switched and 2G 
    (second generation) wireless systems will eventually evolve/morph 
    into an end-to-end IP platform that provides ubiquitous real-time 
    as well as non-real-time services based on 3G (third generation) 
    wireless IPv6 mobile networks. A NSIS framework that provides the 
    end-to-end QoS guarantees for the future network is worth studying. 
    The intention of NSIS framework structure is to provide a framework 
    for the integration of NSIS entities, NSIS signalings, NSIS 
    negotiations with the existing network infrastructures, and we try 
    to identify what NSIS should do in which part of the network, and 
    what NSIS entities should be added.  

    Although we donÆt consider exactly for what NSIS should signal 
    currently, and resource is a broad sence concept, anyway NSIS 
    should achieve end-to-end QoS guarantee to end users and achieve 
    resource management signaling mechanisms to network operators. 

    In the proposed NSIS framework there is a central server which has 
    global resource information of the whole NSIS domain, and several 
    local nodes which feed the local information to the central server; 
    and the NSIS signaling and user traffic transport are separated in 
    control plane and transport plane.  

    We assume that the existing QoS mechanisms can guarantee the 
    traffic transported to the right destination. The aggregate traffic 
    crossing NSIS Domain borders is served according to relatively 
    stable, long-lived bilateral agreements. End-to-end QoS support is 
    achieved through the concatenation of such bilateral 
    agreements.Things about transport plane is out of the scope of this 
    draft. 

    NSIS signaling should be done in three levels. The first level is 
    Inter-NSIS Domain NSIS signaling across neighboring NSIS Domains, 
    and the second level is Intra-NSIS Domain NSIS signaling inside 
    each NSIS Domain while the third level is end-to-edge NSIS 
    signaling and end-to-end NSIS signaling. The first two levels are 
    mainly about resource policies, so they can almost be done based on 
    existing protocols such as COPS, DIAMETER, etc.. 

    End-to-edge and end-to-end NSIS signaling are considered as the 
    focus areas in this draft. These two types of singalings should 
    provide flexibility for different QoS session management that can 
    be either based on existing reservation or provisioning mechanisms.

    In order to have the common definitions with other drafts, some 
    terms are adopted from some drafts. Section 3 describes the two-
    plane framework and its components. Section 4 explains three-tier 
    NSIS signalings. How the framework guarantees the end-to-end QoS 
    and the three-tier NSIS signalings are presented in Section 5.

    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 

 2. Terminology 
         

    Administration Domain (AD) 
                        An AD has the same management methods, pricing 
                        policies and so on. An AD belongs to an 
                        administrative organization and an 
                        administrative organization may have one or 
                        more ADs. An AD includes a backbone and some 
                        ANs that directly connect to the backbone. 

    Access Network (AN) 
                        The AN represents the wireless and back-haul 
                        infrastructure that provides MNs with wireless 
                        access to the wired infrastructure. An AN 
                        usually comprises a set of base stations and 
                        base station controllers. 

    Backbone Network (BN) 
                        The networks can be controlled and manageable 
                        so the configuration and provision can be done 
                        well in it. 

    Control Plane (CP) 
                        Aggregate of network functionalities including 
                        entities such as resource management mechanisms, 
                        routing protocols, admission control, NSIS 
                        signaling, and NSIS negotiation. 

    Default Router (DR) 
                        A router through which the AN connects directly 
                        to the backbone network and the traffic from AN 
                        to backbone. 

    Mobile Node (MN)  
                        MN is the device that allows users to 
                        communicate, and also provides means of 
                        interaction between users and the networks. 
                        Traffic is generated/received by MN and may be

                        queued in the MN while waiting for 
                        transmission/reception. 

    NSIS Domain (ND) 
                        Administrative domain where an NSIS protocol 
                        signals for a resource or set of resources. 

    NSIS Entity (NE) 
                        the function within a node which implements an 
                        NSIS protocol. 

    NSIS Initiator (NI)  
                        NSIS Entity that initiates NSIS signaling for a 
                        network resource. 

    NSIS Responder (NR)  
                        NSIS Entity that terminates NSIS signaling and 
                        can optionally interact with applications as 
                        well. 

    NSIS Forwarder (NF)  
                        NSIS Entity on the path between a NI and NR 
                        which may interact with local resource 
                        management function (RMF) for this purpose. 
                        NSIS Forwarder also propagates NSIS signaling 
                        further through the network. 

    Resource 
                        something of value in a network infrastructure 
                        to which rules or policy criteria are first 
                        applied before access is granted. Examples of 
                        resources include the buffers in a router and 
                        bandwidth on an interface.QoS can be considered 
                        a special example of resource. 

    Resource Management Function (RMF) 
                        An abstract concept, representing the 
                        management of resources in a domain or a node. 

    NSIS Domain Resource Management Agent(NDRM Agent) 
                        There is one logical NDRM Agent in each ND. The 
                        NDRM Agent has the global information about the 
                        resources available in the whole ND. The 
                        communications between the NDRM Agents is 
                        through the COPS [RFC2748] protocol or Diameter 
                        protocol. The NDRM Agent is responsible for 
                        resource management mechanisms between the 
                        neighboring NDs and responsible for resource 
                        control mechanisms between the ANRM Agents.

    Access Network Resource Management Agent(ANRM Agent) 
                        ANRM Agent is a separate logical entity and 
                        maybe incorporated with the default router. 
                        ANRM Agent has the local information about the 
                        AN. The default router interacts with ANRM 
                        Agent, if necessary, when the MN requests 
                        certain degrees of resources in this AN. The 
                        ANRM Agent is the entity for NSIS negotiation 
                        and NSIS signaling between MN and the network 
                        control system. The ANRM Agent decides what 
                        resources are available for each default 
                        router. Thus, the ANRM Agent is an intelligent 
                        entity residing in the control plane. ANRM 
                        Agents provide the local resource information 
                        to NDRM Agent periodically. ANRM Agent 
                        maintains a table that is then updated by NDRM 
                        Agent periodically too. Based on this table, 
                        ANRM Agent will tell the default routers how to 
                        mark, police, shape, map, etc. the traffic 
                        going through the default router. 
                         
                        The communications between the NDRM Agent and 
                        ANRM Agents can be through the COPS protocol or 
                        Diameter protocol, and the communications 
                        between the ANRM Agent and the default router 
                        can be through the COPS protocol or Diameter 
                        protocol too. 

    Transport Plane (TP) 
                        Aggregate of network functionalities where per-
                        packet activities such as packet forwarding, 
                        queuing, conditioning and header editing occur 
                        (Per-flow packet conditioning may require 
                        interaction with control plane). 

 3. Two-plane framework  
     

    The separation principle for the design of a generalized NSIS 
    framework states that media transfer, control and management are 
    functionally distinct architectural activities [A92]. The principle 
    states that these tasks should be separated in architectural 
    frameworks; one aspect of separation is the distinction between 
    signalling and media-transfer; flows (which are isochronous in 
    nature) generally require a wide variety of high bandwidth, low 
    latency, non-assured services with some form of jitter correction; 
    on the other hand, signalling (which is full duplex and 
    asynchronous in nature) generally requires low bandwidth, assured-
    type services with no jitter constraint.

    In the proposed framework the resource management mechanisms and 
    NSIS Signaling and NSIS negotiations are in the control plane, and 
    media-transfer is in the transport plane  

    In this draft we assume that one can do a competent job of network 
    configuration & provisioning in the backbone network, and per-class 
    flow QoS can be guaranteed perfectly by DiffServ, MPLS, whatever. 
    This may be enough in many cases. Just keeps backbone network 
    stupid simple. The most important parts of an NSIS domain would be 
    the ingress & egress nodes which are NSIS-ware, so an Intelligent 
    Edge should be formed between backbone network and access networks. 
    NDRM Agent is responsible for the resource management in each ND. 
    COPS or other protocols can be used for communications between NDRM 
    Agent and ingress & egress nodes. 

    Per-flow QoS can be graranteed in access network especiall Radio 
    Access Networks, so the intermediate routers and default routers 
    should be NSIS-ware. 

 3.1 Control Plane 
     

    The basic entities in control plane include NDRM Agents, ANRM Agent, 
    and NSIS entities which may be co-located with ingress & egress 
    routers, default routers. The tasks of control plane is to manage 
    reousrce and signal resource. How to manage resource is out of the 
    scope of this draft. 

    In the proposed framework, there is at least one NDRM Agents and 
    several ANRM Agents in a ND. ANRM Agents reside generally in the 
    edge of wired backbone networks that connect to wireless network 
    through default router, and ANRM Agent can work as a server or co-
    loated with the default router. 

    The NDRM Agent retains the global resource information of the ND, 
    and informs ANRM Agents what to do for resource management. The MN 
    has the QoS signaling with ANRM Agent, and ANRM Agent has the QoS 
    signaling with NDRM Agent. The actual traffic generated by MN goes 
    through the default router. The NDRM Agent and ANRM Agents are in 
    control plane while the default routers are in transport plane. By 
    retaining the global resource information in NDRM Agent and 
    separating control plane and transport plane, the framework is 
    flexible, easy to add new services, and more efficient for mobile 
    environment. 

    Three-tier NSIS signaling means that NSIS signaling should be done 
    in three levels. The first level is Inter-NDRM Agent NSIS signaling 
    across neighboring NDRM Agents, and the second level is Intra-NDRM 
    Agent NSIS Signaling inside each ND, while the third level is End-
    to-Edge NSIS signaling and End-to-end NSIS signaling.

    The signaling protocol can be COPS or Diameter or whatever between 
    NDRM Agents, between NDRM Agents and ANRM Agents. 

    Figure 1 is the overall picture of the control plane in the 
    framework. There are 2 NDs in this figure and ND1 has 2 ANs each of 
    which connects to the backbone and has a ANRM Agent.

 3.2 Transport Plane 
     

    User traffic is transported in transport plane. The user data enter 
    the backbone network from AN through default router. How about the 
    backbone network in the transport plane? 

    As we know, for controlling the traffic there are two types of 
    Internet QoS: Integrated Services [IntServ] and Differentiated 
    Services. Integrated Services is based on resource reservation and 
    network resources are apportioned according to an application's QoS 
    requests, and subject to bandwidth management policy. Integrated 
    Services can guarantee QoS for per-flow traffic. Differentiated 
    Services is based on prioritization and network traffic is 
    classified and apportioned network resources according to bandwidth 
    management policy criteria. To enable QoS, classifications give 
    preferential treatment to applications identified as having more 
    demanding requirements. Differentiated Services can guarantee QoS 
    for per-aggregate traffic. 

    While the aggregated behavior state of the Differentiated Services 
    architecture does offer excellent scaling properties, the lack of 
    end-to-end signaling facilities makes such an approach one that 
    cannot operate in isolation within any environment. What appears to 
    be required within the Differentiated Services model is both 
    resource availability signaling from the core of the network to the 
    Differentiated Service boundary and some form of signaling from the 
    boundary to the client application [RFC2990]. 

    In the proposed framework a kind of resource allocation protocol 
    for the per-flow traffic in the AN. When the traffic leaves the AN, 
    per-flow traffic is aggregated to form aggregate-flows in the 
    default router. Moreover Differentiated Service is selected in the 
    backbone network and the QoS for aggregate flows between NDs is 
    guaranteed by the other mechanisms [RFC2996], [FCFB99] and 
    [RFC2998]. Other QoS protocols such as MPLS [MPLS] can be selected 
    in the backbone network too.  

    Figure 2 is a picture about transport plane for end-to-end QoS 
    guarantee. 

    There are two mapping mechanisms in transport plane: Intra-ND 
    mapping and Inter-ND mapping. Because of different QoS mechanisms 
    in ANs and the backbone network, Intra-ND mapping mechanisms can 
    guarantee the traffic between ANs and backbone network with QoS 
    consistency. Inter-ND mapping mechanisms can guarantee the traffic 
    between ADs with QoS consistency.

 4. Three-tier NSIS signalings in control plane 
         

    In [TWOZ99] a two-tier resource management model for the Internet 
    is proposed. The solution resembles the current two-tier routing 
    hierarchy and allows individual administrative domains to 
    independently make their own decisions on strategies and protocols 
    to use for internal resource management. We borrowed some ideas 
    from this paper and the three-tier NSIS signalings are proposed in 
    the framework. 

    The tenet of our design is what we call three-tier NSIS signalings. 
    By this term we mean that NSIS signalings should be done in three 
    levels. The first level is Inter-ND NSIS signalings across 
    neighboring NDs, and the second level is Intra-ND NSIS signalings 
    inside each ND, while the third level includes End-to-Edge NSIS 
    signalings and End-to-end NSIS signalings. Following the paradigm 
    of Internet Routing, each ND is free to choose whatever NSIS 
    signalings it deems proper for internal NSIS signalings as long as 
    its bilateral SLA with neighboring NDs are met.  

    These three NSIS signalings have different time cycle for signaling 
    actions. The first tier has the longer time cycle than the other 
    tiers. The third tier is based on per-flow time cycle. 

 4.1 The first tier NSIS signalings 
         

    While AN QoS can be fined grained (per flow), we require that 
    Inter-ND QoS agreements such as SLAs are made for the aggregate 
    traffic crossing NDs. Furthermore, Inter-ND agreements should 
    change infrequently at a larger time-cycle than that of individual 
    applications. These two requirements on Inter-ND agreements provide 
    substantial scaling characteristics by decoupling Inter-ND QoS 
    mechanisms from individual end-to-end flows. So the first tier NSIS 
    signalings occur between neighboring NDRM Agents in different NDs. 
    COPS or Diameter can be used for NSIS protocol, and actually SLAs 
    are signaled in this tier.  

    Note that the NBRM Agent contacts only its immediate neighbor for 
    all its traffic, although the traffic may head toward various final 
    destinations far away. It is the responsibility of the downstream 
    domain, after agreeing to carry the client traffic, to both 
    guarantee QoS internally as well as request QoS from the downstream 
    neighbors for the portions of the traffic that exit the domain. 

    As we know, end-to-end QoS is provided by the concatenation of 
    Intra-ND QoS mechanisms and bilateral SLAs between neighboring NDs.

    These agreements specify the amount of traffic belonging to 
    different classes that crosses links connecting adjacent NDs. To 
    ensure that the level of actual traffic is always lower than the 
    negotiated limit, the receiving domain polices incoming traffic, 
    dropping or demoting excess traffic. Knowing that offending traffic 
    will be policed, the sending domain in turn, shapes traffic so that 
    it always remains in profile. 

 4.2 The second tier NSIS signalings 
     

    The second tier NSIS signalings occur between NDRM Agent and ANRM 
    Agents in the same ND. COPS or Diameter can be used for NSIS 
    protocol, and actually the resources for aggregate flows from/to AN 
    are signaled in this tier.  

    ANRM Agents contact NBRM Agent to request certain about of 
    resources to cover for the aggregate high quality traffic leaving 
    the AN. Once the agreement is in place, ANRM Agent will tell 
    default router how to do the configuration, and individual 
    applications can request and use portions of the aggregate 
    allocated amount from the default router. When and if the allocated 
    resources are exhausted, the ANRM Agents may be able to re-
    negotiate the agreement with its NBRM Agent, allocating a larger 
    amount of resources.  

    For example one of the purposes of Intra-ND resource provisioning 
    mechanisms is to check whether sufficient network resources are 
    available for traffic flowing through each AN and if so to allocate 
    domain resources for this traffic. Each ANRM Agent is responsible 
    for resource provisioning internally. 

 4.3 The third tier NSIS signalings 
     

    The third tier NSIS signalings includes End-to-Edge NSIS signaling 
    between MN and the default router which is NSIS-ware, and End-to-
    End NSIS Signaling between MN and CN. 

 5. NSIS negotiation 
     

    Meeting resource guarantees in network systems is fundamentally an 
    end-to-end issue, that is, from application to application. In our 
    framework there is a NBRM Agent acts as the resource controller for 
    each NSIS domain. Neighboring NBRM Agents communicate with each 
    other to establish Inter-domain resources agreements such as SLAs. 
    The aggregate traffic crossing domain borders is served according 
    to relatively stable, long lived bilateral agreements. End-to-End

 draft-Kan-QoS-Framework-01.txt                              July, 2002 
  
  
    NSIS signaling support is achieved through the concatenation of 
    such bilateral agreements. 

    NSIS negotiation includes End-to-Edge NSIS negotiation based on 
    End-to-Edge NSIS signaling and end-to-end QoS negotiation End-to-
    End NSIS signaling. End-to-Edge QoS negotiation happens between the  
    MN/CN and default routers. End-to-end QoS negotiation happens 
    between MN and CN. 

    When a MN moves to a foreign network and wants to communicate with 
    other nodes, it will negotiate with the foreign network through the 
    End-to-Edng NSIS signalings to guarantee some necessary resources 
    for its applications. If the foreign network cannot meet MN's 
    resource requirements, MN can decide whether or not enter this 
    network or re-negotiate with the network with degrading its 
    resource requirements. Moreover, the foreign network can decide 
    whether or not allow the MN to enter based on the current resource 
    conditions. The foreign network must inform MN the NSIS negotiation 
    results and this is called the response of NSIS. 

    If the foreign network allows the MN to enter, it will inform MN 
    the successful results through the End-to-edge NSIS signalings and 
    reserve required resources for MN based on some resource management 
    mechanisms. When MN leaves the network, the resources used by MN 
    will be released by MN itself or the network. 

    After MN is admitted to enter the foreign network, it will inform 
    CN of its resource requirements for an application through End-to-
    End NSIS signalings. The CN will decide whether or not communicate 
    with this MN, and CN will inform MN the unsuccessful negotiation 
    result if CN cannot meet MN's NSIS requirements. Otherwise the CN 
    will negotiate with the network in which CN is locating based on 
    the MN's NSIS requirements. In some cases CN can meet MN's 
    requirements but network cannot. If the CN and the CN's located 
    network all can meet MN's QoS requirements, MN may communicate with 
    CN. Moreover CN and the CNÆs located network can modify the 
    resource requirements. 

    The procedures of NSIS negotiation has three phases: 1) the 
    negotiation between MN and its located network, 2) the negotiation 
    between MN and CN, 3) the negotiation between CN and its located 
    network. Phase 1 and phase 3 are called End-to-Edge NSIS 
    negotiation, and Phase 2 is called end-to-end NSIS negotiation. 

    The procedures of NSIS negotiation are dependent on what type of 
    NSIS Signaling protocols are used.

 6.1 In-Band and Out-of-Band Signaling 
     

    In-band signaling means that the path followed by the user data 
    packets is the same as the path followed by signaling messages. In 
    other words, the signaling and data paths are identical. In AN, in-
    band signaling should be used.  

    Out-of-band signaling means that the path followed by signaling 
    messages might be different from the path used by the user data 
    packets. In the backbone network, out-of-band sigangling should be 
    used. 

 6.2 End-to-edge and End-to-end Signaling 
     

    End-to-edge signaling is initiated by a MN/CN, and is terminated by 
    the default router, or is initiated by the default router and is 
    terminated by a MN/CN. End-to-edge is a kind of in-band signaling, 
    and is used to reserve resource, state management. 

    End-to-end signaling is initiated by a MN/CN, and is terminiated by 
    a CN/MN. End-to-end signaling is a kind of out-of-band signaling, 
    and is used to take the resource request to the correspondent 
    nodes. 

     

 6.3 An example NSIS Signaling protocol 
     

    A suite of NSIS signalings protocol is necessary for NSIS 
    negotiation in order to guarantee per-flow end-to-end QoS. Although 
    RSVP is a popular QoS signaling, we build a new suite of QoS 
    signaling by extending the existing Moible IPv6 signalings other 
    than selecting RSVP based on the following factors: 

    1) the limitations of RSVP; 

    2) the existing Moible IPv6 mobility management signalings can be 
    extended for QoS negotiation, and doing so can integrate mobility 
    management within QoS negotiation. 

    The extended Mobile IPv6 signalings for QoS negotiation is divided 
    into two parts: edge QoS signalings and end-to-end QoS signalings. 
    Figure 2 shows the QoS signalings.  

    The stateless-based Differentiated Services [DiffServ] lack of QoS 
    response and there is no explicit negotiation between the 
    application's signaling of the service request and the network's

    capability to deliver a particular service response. If the network 
    is incapable of meeting the service request, then the request 
    simply will not be honored. In such a situation there is no 
    requirement for the network to inform the application that the 
    request cannot be honored, and it is left to the application to 
    determine if the service has not been delivered. So our QoS 
    signaling can be a complement for DS. 

    The detailed design of the QoS signaling and the procedures of QoS 
    negotiation will be appeared in other draft.
