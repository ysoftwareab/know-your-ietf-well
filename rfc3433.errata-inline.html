Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for extending the Entity
   MIB (RFC 2737) to provide generalized access to information related
   to physical sensors, which are often found in networking equipment
   (such as chassis temperature, fan RPM, power supply voltage).

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   There is a need for a standardized way of obtaining information
   related to the physical sensors which are commonly found in
   networking equipment.  Information such as the current value of the
   sensor, the current operational status, and the data units precision
   associated with the sensor, should be represented in a consistent
   manner for any type of sensor.

   Physical sensors are represented in the Entity MIB with
   entPhysicalEntry and an entPhysicalClass value of &#x27;sensor(8)&#x27;.  The
   information provided in the ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB module (defined in this
   document) defines a sparse augmentation of the entPhysicalTable, for
   entries which represent physical sensors.

2.1.  Terms

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,  &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119.
   [RFC2119]

2.2.  Relationship to the Entity MIB

   The MIB objects defined in this document provide a sparse
   augmentation to the entPhysicalTable in the Entity MIB, for entries
   in which the associated entPhysicalClass object is equal to
   &#x27;sensor(8)&#x27;.  An agent is expected to maintain an entPhySensorEntry
   with the same entPhysicalIndex value for each entPhysicalEntry
   representing a physical sensor.  Therefore, implementation of the
   entityPhysicalGroup is required for agents that implement the Entity
   Sensor MIB.

2.3.  Relationship to General Thresholding Mechanisms

   There are no specialized sensor value thresholding mechanisms defined
   in this MIB module.  Instead, it is recommended that a generalized
   thresholding MIB, such as the mechanisms defined by the Alarm and
   Events groups of the Remote Network Monitoring MIB [RFC2819], be used
   for this purpose.

3.  MIB Structure

   The Entity Sensor MIB contains a single group called the
   entitySensorValueGroup, which allows objects to convey the current
   value and status of a physical sensor.

   The entitySensorValueGroup contains a single table, called the
   entPhySensorTable, which provides a small number of read-only
   objects:

   entPhySensorType
      This object identifies the type of data units associated with the
      sensor value.

   entPhySensorScale
      This object identifies the (power of 10) scaling factor associated
      with the sensor value.

   entPhySensorPrecision
      This object identifies the number of decimal places of precision
      associated with the sensor value.

   entPhySensorValue
      This object identifies the current value of the sensor.

   entPhySensorOperStatus
      This object identifies the current operational status of the
      sensor (as it&#x27;s known to the agent).

   entPhySensorUnitsDisplay
      This object provides a textual description of the data units
      represented by the entPhySensorType and entPhySensorScale objects.

   entPhySensorValueTimeStamp
      The object identifies the value of sysUpTime at the time the agent
      last updated the information in the entry.  This object is only
      relevant if the agent uses a polling implementation strategy,
      (i.e., the associated entPhySensorValueUpdateRate object is
      greater than zero).

   entPhySensorValueUpdateRate
      This object indicates the nature of the agent implementation of
      the entPhySensorEntry, and contains the (possibly estimated)
      number of milliseconds that elapse between polling updates of the
      information in the associated entry.  The value zero indicates
      that the agent always return current data for the entry (as
      opposed to the data as it was at the last polling interval).

EntitySensorPrecision ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;An object using this data type represents a sensor
            precision range.

            An object of this type SHOULD be defined together with
            objects of type EntitySensorDataType and
            EntitySensorDataScale.  Together, associated objects of
            these three types are used to identify the semantics of an
            object of type EntitySensorValue.

            If an object of this type contains a value in the range 1 to
            9, it represents the number of decimal places in the
            fractional part of an associated EntitySensorValue fixed-
            point number.

            If an object of this type contains a value in the range -8
            to -1, it represents the number of accurate digits in the
            associated EntitySensorValue fixed-point number.

            The value zero indicates the associated EntitySensorValue
            object is not a fixed-point number.

            Agent implementors must choose a value for the associated
            EntitySensorPrecision object so that the precision and

            accuracy of the associated EntitySensorValue object is
            correctly indicated.

            For example, a physical entity representing a temperature
            sensor that can measure 0 degrees to 100 degrees C in 0.1
            degree increments, +/- 0.05 degrees, would have an
            EntitySensorPrecision value of &#x27;1&#x27;, an EntitySensorDataScale
            value of &#x27;units(9)&#x27;, and an EntitySensorValue ranging from
            &#x27;0&#x27; to &#x27;1000&#x27;.  The EntitySensorValue would be interpreted
            as &#x27;degrees C * 10&#x27;.&quot;
    SYNTAX Integer32 (-8..9)

EntitySensorValue ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;An object using this data type represents an Entity Sensor
            value.
            An object of this type SHOULD be defined together with
            objects of type EntitySensorDataType, EntitySensorDataScale
            and EntitySensorPrecision.  Together, associated objects of
            those three types are used to identify the semantics of an
            object of this data type.

            The semantics of an object using this data type are
            determined by the value of the associated
            EntitySensorDataType object.

            If the associated EntitySensorDataType object is equal to
            &#x27;voltsAC(3)&#x27;, &#x27;voltsDC(4)&#x27;, &#x27;amperes(5)&#x27;, &#x27;watts(6),
            &#x27;hertz(7)&#x27;, &#x27;celsius(8)&#x27;, or &#x27;cmm(11)&#x27;, then an object of
            this type MUST contain a fixed point number ranging from
            -999,999,999 to +999,999,999.  The value -1000000000
            indicates an underflow error. The value +1000000000
            indicates an overflow error.  The EntitySensorPrecision
            indicates how many fractional digits are represented in the
            associated EntitySensorValue object.

            If the associated EntitySensorDataType object is equal to
            &#x27;percentRH(9)&#x27;, then an object of this type MUST contain a
            number ranging from 0 to 100.

            If the associated EntitySensorDataType object is equal to
            &#x27;rpm(10)&#x27;, then an object of this type MUST contain a number
            ranging from -999,999,999 to +999,999,999.

            If the associated EntitySensorDataType object is equal to
            &#x27;truthvalue(12)&#x27;, then an object of this type MUST contain
            either the value &#x27;true(1)&#x27; or the value &#x27;false(2)&#x27;.

            If the associated EntitySensorDataType object is equal to
            &#x27;other(1)&#x27; or unknown(2)&#x27;, then an object of this type MUST
            contain a number ranging from -1000000000 to 1000000000.&quot;
    SYNTAX Integer32 (-1000000000..1000000000)

EntitySensorStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;An object using this data type represents the operational
            status of a physical sensor.

            The value &#x27;ok(1)&#x27; indicates that the agent can obtain the
            sensor value.

            The value &#x27;unavailable(2)&#x27; indicates that the agent
            presently cannot obtain the sensor value.

            The value &#x27;nonoperational(3)&#x27; indicates that the agent
            believes the sensor is broken.  The sensor could have a hard
            failure (disconnected wire), or a soft failure such as out-
            of-range, jittery, or wildly fluctuating readings.&quot;

    DESCRIPTION
            &quot;Information about a particular physical sensor.

            An entry in this table describes the present reading of a
            sensor, the measurement units and scale, and sensor
            operational status.

            Entries are created in this table by the agent.  An entry
            for each physical sensor SHOULD be created at the same time
            as the associated entPhysicalEntry.  An entry SHOULD be
            destroyed if the associated entPhysicalEntry is destroyed.&quot;

            The value zero indicates:

                - the sensor value is updated on demand (e.g.,
                  when polled by the agent for a get-request),
                - the sensor value is updated when the sensor
                  value changes (event-driven),
                - the agent does not know the update rate.

9.  Security Considerations

   There is one managed object in this MIB that may contain sensitive
   information.  This is:

       entPhySensorValue

   This object may expose the values of particular physical sensors for
   a device.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the
   View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is
   recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to only the objects, and those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
