Abstract

In some circumstances the use of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme 
in a prime order subgroup of a large prime p is vulnerable to certain 
attacks known as "small-subgroup" attacks.  Methods exist, however, to 
prevent these attacks.  This document will describe the situations 
relevant to implementations of S/MIME version 3 in which protection is 
required and the methods that can be used to prevent these attacks.


1. Introduction

This document will describe those situations in which protection from 
"small-subgroup" type attacks are required when using Diffie-Hellman key 
agreement [x942] in implementations of S/MIME version 3 [CMS, MSG].  
Thus, the ephemeral-static modes of Diffie-Hellman will be focused on.  
The situations that require protection are those in which an attacker 
could determine a substantial portion (i.e. more than a few bits) of a 
user's private key.

Protecting oneself from these attacks involves certain costs.  These 
costs may include additional processing time either when a public key is 
certified or a shared secret key is derived, increased parameter 
generation time, and possibly the licensing of encumbered technologies.

Zuccherato                                                        Page 1

All of these factors must be considered when deciding whether or not to 
protect oneself from these attacks, or whether to engineer the 
application so that protection is not required.

We will not consider "attacks" where the other party in the key 
agreement merely forces the shared secret value to be "weak" (i.e. from 
a small set of possible values) without attempting to compromise the 
private key.  It is not worth the effort to attempt to prevent these 
attacks since the other party in the key agreement gets the shared 
secret and can simply make the plaintext public.

The methods described in this draft may also be used to provide 
protection from similar attacks on elliptic curve based Diffie-Hellman.

1.1 Notation

In this document we will use the same notation as in [x942].  In 
particular the shared secret ZZ is generated as follows:           

     ZZ = g ^ (xb * xa) mod p

Note that the individual parties actually perform the computations:

     ZZ = (yb ^ xa)  mod p  = (ya ^ xb)  mod p

where ^ denotes exponentiation.

     ya is Party A's public key; ya = g ^ xa mod p
     yb is Party B's public key; yb = g ^ xb mod p
     xa is Party A's private key
     xb is Party B's private key         
     p is a large prime
     g = h^((p-1)/q) mod p, where
     h is any integer with 1 < h < p-1 such that h^((p-1)/q) mod p > 1
           (g has order q mod p)         
     q is a large prime
     j a large integer such that p=q*j + 1

In this discussion, a "static" public key is one that is certified and 
is used for more than one key agreement, and an "ephemeral" public key 
is one that is not certified but is used only one time.

The order of an integer y modulo p is the smallest value of x greater 
than 1 such that y^x mod p = 1. 

1.2 Brief Description of Attack

For a complete description of these attacks see [LAW98] and [LIM].

If the other party in an execution of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement 
method has a public key not of the form described above, but of small 
order (where small means less than q) then he/she may be able to obtain 
information about the user's private key.  In particular, if information 
on whether or not a given decryption was successful is available, if 
ciphertext encrypted with the agreed upon key is available, or if a MAC 
computed with the agreed upon key is available, information about the 

Zuccherato                                                        Page 2

user's private key can be obtained.

Assume Party A has a properly formatted public key ya and that Party B 
has a public key yb that is not of the form described in Section 1.1, 
rather yb has order r, where r<<q.  Thus yb^r=1 mod p.  Now, when Party 
A produces ZZ as yb^xa mod p, there will only be r possible values for 
ZZ instead of q possible values.  At this point Party B does not know 
the value ZZ, but may be able to exhaustively search for it.

If Party A encrypts plaintext with this value and makes that ciphertext 
available to Party B, Party B only needs to exhaustively search through 
r possibilities to determine which key produced the ciphertext.  When 
the correct one is found, this gives information about the value of xa 
modulo r.  Similarly, if Party A uses ZZ to decrypt a ciphertext and 
Party B is able to determine whether or not decryption was performed 
correctly, then information about xa can be obtained.  The actual number 
of messages that must be sent or received for these attacks to be 
successful will depend on the structure of the prime p.  However, it is 
not unreasonable to expect that the entire private key could be 
determined after as few as one hundred messages.

A similar attack can be mounted if Party B chooses a public key of the 
form yb=g^xb*f, where f is an element of small order.  In this situation 
Party A will compute ZZ=yb^xa=g^(xa*xb)*f^xa mod p.  Again, Party B can 
compute g^(xa*xb) and can therefore exhaust the small number of possible 
values of f^xa mod p to determine information about xa.

2. Situations Where Protection Is Required

This section describes the situations in which the sender of a message 
should obtain protection against this type of attack and also those 
situations in which the receiver of a message should obtain protection.  
Each entity may decide independently whether it requires protection from 
these attacks.

This discussion assumes that the recipient's key pair is static, as is 
always the case in [x942].

2.1 Message Sender

This section describes situations in which the message sender should be 
protected.

If the sender's key is ephemeral, (i.e. ephemeral-static Diffie-Hellman 
is being used), then no protection is required.  In this situation only 
the recipients of the message can obtain the plaintext and corresponding 
ciphertext and therefore determine information about the private key 
using the "small-subgroup" attacks.  However, the recipients can always 
decrypt the message and since the sender's key is ephemeral, even if the 
recipient can learn the entire private key no other messages are at 
risk.  Notice here that if two or more recipients have selected the same 
domain parameters (p,q,g) then the same ephemeral public key can be used 
for all of them.  Since the key is ephemeral and only associated with a 
message that the recipients can already decrypt, no interesting attacks 
are possible.


Zuccherato                                                        Page 3

If the sender's key is static (i.e. static-static Diffie-Hellman is 
being used), then protection is required because in this situation a 
recipient mounting a small-subgroup attack will obtain the plaintext and 
corresponding ciphertext and therefore could obtain information about 
the private key using the "small-subgroup" attacks.  This information 
could then be used to attack other messages protected with the same 
static key.  

2.2 Message Recipient

This section describes situations in which the message recipient should 
be protected.

If absolutely no information on the decryption of the ciphertext is 
available to any other party than the recipient, then protection is not 
required because this attack requires information on whether the 
decryption was successful to be sent to the attacker.  So, no protective 
measures are needed if the implementation ensures that no information 
about the decryption can leak out.  However, protection may be warranted 
if human users may give this information to the sender via out of band 
means (e.g. through telephone conversations). 

If information on the decryption is available to any other party , then 
protection is required.

3. Methods Of Protection

This section describes five protective measures that senders and 
recipients of messages can use to protect themselves from "small-
subgroup" attacks.

3.1 Public Key Validation

This method is described in Section 2.1.5 of [x942], and its description 
is repeated here.  If this method is used, it should be used to validate 
public keys of the other party prior to computing the shared secret ZZ.  
The public key to be validated is y.

     1. Verify that y lies within the interval [2,p-1]. If it does not,
        the key is invalid.
     2. Compute y^q mod p. If the result == 1, the key is valid.
        Otherwise the key is invalid.

Note that this procedure may be subject to pending patents.


3.2 CA Performs Public Key Validation

The Certification Authority (CA) could perform the Public Key Validation 
method described in Section 3.1 prior to signing and issuing a 
certificate containing a Diffie-Hellman public key.  In this way, any 
party using the public key can be assured that a trusted third party has 
already performed the key validation process.  This method is only 
viable for static public keys.  When Static-Static Diffie-Hellman is 
employed, both the sender and recipient are protected when the CA has 
performed public key validation.  However, when Ephemeral-Static Diffie- 

Zuccherato                                                        Page 4

Hellman is employed, only the sender can be protected.  Since the sender 
uses an ephemeral public key, the CA cannot perform the validation on 
that public key.

In the case of a static public key a method must exist to assure the 
user that the CA has actually performed this verification.  The CA can 
notify certificate users that it has performed the validation by 
reference to the CA's Certificate Policy (CP) and Certification Practice 
Statement (CPS) [RFC2527] or through extensions in the certificate.

Note that this procedure may be subject to pending patents.

3.3 Choice of Prime p

The prime p could be chosen such that p-1=2*q*j where j is a large prime 
or is the product of large primes (large means greater than or equal to 
q).  This will prevent an attacker from being able to find an element of 
small order modulo p, thus thwarting the small-subgroup attack.  One 
method to produce primes of this form is to run the prime generation 
algorithm multiple times until an appropriate prime is obtained.  As an 
example, the value of j could be tested for primality.  If j is prime, 
then the value of p could be accepted, otherwise the prime generation 
algorithm would be run again, until a value of p is produced with j 
prime.

However, since with primes of this form there is still an element of 
order 2 (i.e. -1), one bit of the private key could still be lost.  
Thus, this method may not be appropriate in circumstances where the loss 
of a single bit of the private key is a concern.

Another method to produce primes of this form is to choose the prime p 
such that p = 2*q*j + 1 where j is small (i.e. only a few bits). In this 
case, the leakage due to a small subgroup attack will be only a few 
bits.  Again, this would not be appropriate for circumstances where the 
loss of even a few bits of the private key is a concern.

Additionally, other methods (i.e. public key validation) can be combined 
with this method in order to prevent the loss of a few bits of the 
private key.

3.4 Compatible Cofactor Exponentiation 

This method of protection is specified in [p1363] and [KALISKI].  It 
involves modifying the computation of ZZ.  Instead of computing ZZ as 
ZZ=yb^xa mod p, Party A would compute it as ZZ=(yb^j)^c mod p where 
c=j^(-1)*xa mod q.  (Similarly for Party B.) 

If the resulting value ZZ satisfies ZZ==1, then the key agreement should 
be abandoned because the public key being used is invalid.

Note that this procedure may be subject to pending patents.

3.5 Non-compatible Cofactor Exponentiation

This method of protection is specified in [p1363].  Similar to the 
method of Section 3.4, it involves modifying the computation of ZZ. 

Zuccherato                                                        Page 5

Instead of computing ZZ as ZZ=yb^xa mod p, Party A would compute it as 
ZZ=(yb^j)^xa mod p.  (Similarly for Party B.)  However, with this method 
the resulting ZZ value is different from what is computed in [x942] and 
therefore is not interoperable with implementations conformant to 
[x942].

If the resulting value ZZ satisfies ZZ==1, then the key agreement should 
be abandoned because the public key being used is invalid.

Note that this procedure may be subject to pending patents.

4. Ephemeral-Ephemeral Key Agreement

This situation is when both the sender and recipient of a message are 
using ephemeral keys.  While this situation is not possible in S/MIME, 
it might be used in other protocol environments.  Thus we will briefly 
discuss protection for this case as well.

In most ephemeral-ephemeral key agreements protection is required for 
both entities.  In this situation a third party attacker could modify 
the other entity's public key in order to determine the user's private 
key (as described in Section 1.2). Another possibility is that the 
attacker could modify both parties' public key so as to make their 
shared key predictable.  For example, the attacker could replace both ya 
and yb with some element of small order, say -1.  Then, with a certain 
probability, both the sender and receiver would compute the same shared 
value that comes from some small, easily exhaustible set.  

Note that in this situation if protection was obtained from the methods 
of Section 3.3, then each user must ensure that the other party's public 
key does not come from the small set of elements of small order.  This 
can be done either by checking a list of such elements, or by 
additionally applying the methods of Sections 3.1, 3.4 or 3.5.
 
Protection from these attacks is not required however if the other 
party's ephemeral public key has been signed by the other party.  An 
example of this is in the Station-To-Station protocol [STS].  Since the 
owner authenticates the public key, a third party cannot modify it and 
therefore cannot mount an attack.  Thus, the only person that could 
attack an entity's private key is the other authenticated entity in the 
key agreement. However, since both public keys are ephemeral, they only 
protect the current session that the attacker would have access to 
anyway.
