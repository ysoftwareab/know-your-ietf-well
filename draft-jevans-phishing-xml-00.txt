Abstract

   Phishing, a broadly-launched social engineering attack in which an
   electronic identity is misrepresented in an attempt to trick
   individuals into revealing credentials, is expanding on the Internet.
   Corporations, Service Providers, consumer agencies, and financial
   institutions have started to collect and correlate phishing attack
   information to better plan out mitigation activities and to assist in

   prosecution.  Early on it became obvious that a common format for the
   data reported or exchanged between this parties was necessary.

   This document defines a data format for reporting phishing attacks
   and sharing data between repositories of phishing attacks.  The
   format is an outgrowth of the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG)
   activities in data sharing and is based upon the Incident Handling
   Working Group's (INCH) XML-based format for sharing incident data.
   Although we use the term "phishing attack", the data format is
   flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities
   throughout the entire phishing life cycle.  The attack format is also
   extensible enough to be used for other related reporting such as DNS
   spoofs (eg.  localhost file takeover on PCs) and keyloggers typically
   related to the phishing attack.  The format shall also support very
   simple reporting as well as optional fields for detailed reports and
   supports single phish reports as well as consolidated reports of
   multiple phish reports.

RFC 2129 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   The accumulation and correlation of information is very important
   when dealing with security incidents.  In phishing attacks the source
   of the attack may be forged and it's quite possible that the targeted
   organization may not even be aware of the ongoing attack.  Parties
   aware of the attack may wish to notify the target, or an
   organization's internal monitoring systems may detect the attack and
   wish to take mitigation steps.  Unfortunately, there is no recognized
   standard way of expressing the detection of a phishing attack nor an
   acceptable way to exchange the required information.  For an
   organization that employs multi anti-phishing technologies,
   correlating data from multiple vendors or products is close to
   impossible as the data is reported in multiple, mostly incompatible,
   formats.

   This document defines a data format that should be used to capture
   relevant information from a phishing attack and shared, correlated,
   or to populate a database.  Additionally, the use of products that
   export information in this format will allow an organization to
   correlate and analyze phishing information across their organization,
   in effect information sharing with themselves.  Although targeted at
   both the accumulation of phishing attack information from a single
   institution and a means of sharing attack information between
   cooperating parties, the actual information sharing process and
   related political challenges are not covered in this document.

   Instead of defining report format and language from scratch, the
   phishing activities information is encoded as an extension to the
   INCH incident exchange format.[INCH] The use of an already existent
   and operational format allows for quicker vendor adoption and reuse
   of existing tools in organizations.  To reduce duplication and to be
   compatible with modifications to the base IODEF definitions, this
   document only identifies additional structures; The reader is
   expected to have a copy of the IODEF documents handy while reading
   this one.

   In general, an incident report contains detailed incident-specific
   data which populates an EventData Structure.  That EventData
   structure is then incorporated, either singularly or in aggregation,
   with additional summary and contact data, into an Incident structure.
   The populated Incident structure is what is reported as a Phishing
   Activity Report.

   Unsavory phishing activity may include multiple email messages,
   attacks, or events, scattered over various times, locations, and
   methodoligies.  As each of these activities may generate multiple
   reports to an incident team, the Phishing Activity Report is composed

Internet-Draft           IODEF Phishing Reports            December 2004


   of multiple XML Incident classes.  Each Incident class is used to
   report one or more individual phishing reports and may include
   multiple RecordData elelments.

   This document defines new attributes for the EventData and Record
   Item IODEF XML classes, then identifies attributes that are required
   in a compliant Phishing Activity Report.  The Appendices contain
   sample Phishing Activity Reports and the complete Document Type
   Definition.

1.1  INCH Dependencies

   As discussions started to define a format for this information, it
   became apparent that the output needed two things: include cognizant
   data, and be supported by large numbers of vendors and products.
   Instead of reinventing a basic reporting formula, we selected the
   IETF IncidentHandling Working Group's (INCH) already-defined
   XML-based attack data exchange models and formats.

   The IODEF Extensions defined in this document comply with section4,
   "Extending the IODEF Format" in [INCH].

2.  Phishing Actvitiy Reporting via an IODEF-Document Incident

   A Phishing Activity Report is an instance of a IODEF-Document XML
   Incident class [INCH] with added EventData and AdditionalData
   classes.  Some required information with many optional items are
   populated into the new structure to form a Phishing Activity Report.
   To facilitate completeness, the report originator should fill out as
   much as possible of the optional Incident fields, but SHALL stay
   consistent with the IODEF-Document structure.

   This document defines the new Incident classes for the
   AdditionalData, EventData, and Record Item IODEF XML classes; then
   identifies attributes that are required in a compliant Phishing
   Activity Report.  The Appendices contain sample Phishing Activity
   Reports and the complete XML Document Type Definition and schema.

   The Incident class is summarized below and provides a standardized
   representation for commonly exchanged incident data and associates a
   CSIRT assigned unique identifier with the described activity.

   Figure 1.  The INCH XML Incident class (modified)

   A Phishing Activity Report is composed of one Incident class,
   containing one or more EventData attributes.  This document defines a
   PhishingReport class for the Incident.EventData.AdditionalData
   comprising of phishing-related information that does not map to
   existing Incident or EventData attributes.  The following section
   defines the new extensions specific to the Incident class EventData

4.  Definition of PhishRecord class

   Extensions are also made to the Incident EventData Additional Data
   class, to support descriptive information received in phish emails.

4.1  PhishRecord class

   Data specific to this phishing activity is represented within a new
   extenxion to the RecordItem class of the RecordData class of an
   EventData class in an Incident class.
   +-----------------------+
   | RecordItem            |
   +-----------------------+
   | ANY (PhishRecord)     |
   | ENUM Type (xml)       |
   +-----------------------+

5.  IODEF Required Elements

   A Phishing Report requires certain identifying information, which is
   contained within the standard IODEF Incident data structure.  The
   following table identifies attributes used in a Phishing Activity
   Report and their obligation.  Note that the Required column notes
   attributes required by the base IODEF Incident class.  Attributes
   identified as required SHALL be populated in conforming phishing
   activity reports.

   The following table is a visual description of the required fields.

   +--------------+
   | Incident     |
   +--------------+
   | ENUM |---[ IncidentID     ]
   |      |---[ Assessment     ]|---[ Confidence  ]
   |      |---[ ReportTime     ]
   |      |---[ Contact        ]|---[ Role        ]
   |      |                     |---[ Type        ]|---[ Name              ]
   |      |---[ AdditionalData ]|---[ PhishReport ]|---[ Version           ]
   |      |                                        |---[ PhishType         ]
   |      |                                        |---[ OriginatingSensor ]|---OriginatingSensorFirstSeen ]
   |      |
   +------+

   These following MUST be populated in a compliant Phishing Activity
   Report:
      IncidentID
      Assessment -> Confidence
      ReportTime
      Contact -> Role
      Contact -> Type
      Contact -> Name
      AdditionalData -> PhishReport -> Version
      AdditionalData -> PhishReport -> PhishType
      AdditionalData -> PhishReport -> OriginatingSensor ->
      OriginatingSensorFirstSeen

6.  Guidance on Usage

   It may be apparent that the mandatory attributes for a phishing
   activity report make for a quite sparse report.  As incident
   forensics and data analysis require detailed information, the
   originator of a PhishingReport should include any tidbit of
   information gleaned from the attack.  Information that is considered
   more sensitive than public can be marked to a higher sensitivity
   using the restriction paramater of each data class.

7.  Sample Phishing Report

   A sample (and useful) phishing activity report, that is one that has
   only the required and data items populated, is as follows:

8.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the format of security incident data.  As
   such, the security of transactions containing the incident report
   will vary from organization to organization.  We do not want to
   burden the information exchange with unnecessary encryption
   requirements, as the transport service for the data exchange may
   provide adequate protections, or even encryption.  The use of
   encryption is expected to be agreed upon on originator-recipient
   agreement.

   The critical security concern is that phishing activity reports may
   be falsified or the report may become corrupt during transit.
   Applying a digital signature on each report will counteract both of
   these concerns, but again the signature may be overkill for most
   activity report users.  For this reason, phishing activity reports
   SHOULD be digitally signed with the optional IODEF XML signature,
   although we expect that each receiving entity will determine the need
   for this signature independently.  Generators of phishing activity
   reports SHOULD digitally sign each report.

   Originators of phishing activity reports SHOULD digitally sign their
   report with the XML signature as described in [INCH] .

   Recipients of phishing reports SHALL be prepared to accept XML
   digitally signed reports and SHOULD support receiving encrypted
   reports.

Appendix C.  Mapping from the APWG work into this Document

   Note: This appendix is Informational and will be removed in the next
   version of the document.

   As this document incorporates some previous work done by the APWG,
   this section identifies where the APWG-required data items map into
   the INCH data structures.  The following figure summarizes the APWG
   nomenclature as expressed as Incident classes/fields.

C.1  Overall Format

   Each phishing report is encapsulated in the phishingreport element

   <phishingreport uniqueid> header followed by one or more reports
   </phishingreport uniqueid> One or more phishing reports are included.

C.2  Header Format

   Each report must have a header.  Each header MUST have:

   <keyword>>formatversion<</keyword> version number>/formatversion< The
   version of the XML reporting format.  Eg.  1.0

   <datereportcreated> 32-bit UNIX time<datereportcreated> This is the
   date that the phish report was created.

   <reporterorg> organization who created the phish report</reporterorg>
   Name or other id of who created the phish report (not the name of the
   person who submitted it).  Do we need a unique database of
   reporternames? Eg.  TMWD ‚Çô Tumbleweed Communications Corp.

   Each header MAY have:

   <reportername>name of the person who created the
   report</reportername> Name of an individual.

   <reporteremail>email address of the person who created the
   report</reporteremail> email address of the individual who created
   the report.

   <reportersignature>digitalsignature</reportersignature> An XML
   digital signature of the canonicalized file, everything between the
   <phishingreport></phishingreport>.  We need the hash of the document,
   the certs or URL to them, and the signature.  What format should that
   be? XML-DSIG? This verifies the authenticity of the report.

   <comments>>ext</comments> Any comments that the reporter chooses to
   add to the individual phish report.

   <aggregateflag>01 or nn</aggregateflag> This is a flag for whether
   this XML doc represents a single phish attack event; or it is an
   aggregated document that represents nn discrete events

C.3  Individual Report Format

   Each individual report is encapsulated between phish.

   <phish uniqueid> report fields </phish uniqueid> Each individual
   report is encapsulated between the <phish></phish> with the
   uniqueids.

   Each report MUST have:

   <datedetected>32-bit UNIX time</datedetected> This is the date that
   the phish was reported by a consumer or detected by a trap or other
   means.

   <phishtype>phishtype optional_parameter</phishtype>

   One of the following.

   The optional parameter is a string, without whitespace, that may be
   used to name the malware that installed the keylogger or the
   DNSspoofer.

   Each report MAY have:

   <datacollectiontype>type</datacollectiontype>

   The method of data collection.  This is derived from the victim‚ÇÖs
   computer (eg.  By analyzing the email lure or malware sent to them).
   One of the following:

   <originatingsensorname>name</originatingsensorname>

   The DNS name of the entity that generated this XML document.

   <originatingsensorIPaddress>name</originatingsensorIPaddress>

   The IP address of the entity that generated this XML document.

   <forensics<strings>/forensics<

   Any length of strings of forensic information.  Useful for law
   enforcement.  This could be watermarks in images, comments in HTML
   fields, poisoned user data.

   <emailsite-url>URL</emailsite-url>

   This is the base URI of phishing site that is included in the email
   lure.  This can be used by email spam filters to detect and filter
   out phishing emails by posting it to SURBL.  This also can be used in
   a Web browser to access the phishing site.

   If the site is an SSL site, then the URL specifies https://URL

   <site-url>URL</site-url>

   This is the URI of the phishing data collection site that the browser
   actually goes to in order to post data.  This may differ from the
   emailsite-url, because the URL included in the email might redirect
   users to the actual data collection site, which is the site-url.  The
   emailsite-url is useful for spam filters, the site-url is useful for
   takedown, law enforcement, or web proxy filters to prevent users from
   visiting the collection site.

   If the site is an SSL site, then the URL specifies https://URL

   <emailsubject>subject</emailsubject>

   The subject of the email phish lure.

   <takedowndate>UNIX 32-bit time</takedowndate>

   If the site has been taken down, this is the date and time when that
   was effected.  Which site? Redirector or data collection site?
   Multiples with designator?

   <takedownagency>string</takedownagency>

   Who took the site down.  If more than one party took it down, you may
   list multiple parties as freeform text here, or have multiple
   takedownagency fields.

   <site-ip>>p address (port number optional if not 80)</site-ip>

   The IP address of the server hosting the phishing site in standard IP
   address format A.C.D.E:portnum.  If no portnumber specified, then
   port 80 assumed.

   These IP addresses could be used by ISPs and web filters to block
   access to servers.  However, this is dangerous if the sites are
   running on hacked servers or ISPs that are hosting legitimate sites
   as well.  It can be very useful to filter out access to servers that
   have hijacked DNS through modifying localhosts files for example
   (e.g., 11.1.2004).

   <emailbody uniqueid>body</emailbody uniqueid>

   The body of the email.  I think we need the uniqueid strings.

   What about when the body is an image only? Ex.  GDI exploit to
   install keylogger or single image with hyperlink.

   <emailheaders uniqueid>headers</emailheaders uniqueid>

   The headers of the email

   Do we need to create xml records for each entry in a decomposed
   header? No, only the open relays and the apparent source and possibly
   a few others..

   <brand>brand name</brand>

   The name of the company who‚ÇÖs brand is being used to launch the
   phishing attack

   <senderip>IP address (optional port number)</senderip>

   The IP address of the mail server or relay that delivered the
   phishing email.  This can be used for RBLs.  A single attack may have
   multiple senderips if the mail was sent from multiple relays.

   <otherlink>URL</otherlink>

   Links to non-phish sites that may be relevant (victim site, other
   sites)

   <correlations>strings</correlations>

   Any correlations to known phishing kits or groups.  Freeform text.

   <comments>text</comments>

   Any freeform text comments that the reporter chooses to add to the
   individual phish report.  e.g.,.  "images sourced from victim
   online-banking site" or "background popup populated with victim
   privacy statement".
