Internet-Draft      service function chain Use Cases           July 2014


1.  Introduction

   The object of SFC is trying to unload services from nodes in
   traditional network and deal with such services through service
   function chains.

   As increasingly large number of customers, The possibility of
   deployment SFC in broadband network seems emergency.  And this
   document aims to illustrate the possibly typical and unified service
   function chains in Broadband Networks and analyze the possible
   deployments of diverse service function chains in broadband network.

   In figure 1, here outlines the possible SFC deployment architecture
   in Broadband Networks.

3.  Use cases

   The following sections highlight some of the most common broadband
   network use case scenarios and are in no way exhaustive.

3.1.  Internet Access from Homes

   Figure 2 illustrates an abstract architecture of broadband network,
   including CPE sitted in home network, BNAS as broadband access
   network gateway,CR located in bone network and the Internet.

      +---+      +------+        +-----+      +---------+
      |CPE|------| BNAS |--------| CR  |------| Internet|
      +---+      +------+        +-----+      +---------+

                Figure 2: Architecture of Broadband Network

   Also, the Broadband Forum(BBF) is developing a study document(SD-
   326), which aims to study market requirements and usecases for
   Flexible Service Chaining.  Some usecases in SD-326 are referenced
   here, and as well as that, this document tries to develop more
   typical usecases in Broadband Networks.

3.1.1.  Native IPv4 Network or Native IPv6 Network

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                   +--- +   +-------+   +-----+   +----------+

                |--| UM |---|  /Qos |---| FRR |---|  /FW/PC  |   |
                |  +----+ | +-------+ | +-----+ | +----------+   |
    +---+  +------+       |           |         |             +-----+     +---------+

    +---+  +------+                                           +-----+     +---------+

           Figure 3: Native IPv4 Network or Native IPv6 Network

   Figure 3 shows possible deployment of SFC in native IPv4 network or
   native IPv6 network.  As UM(user management) function, which is the
   main funtion of BNAS in traditional network, consumes large memory
   and resources, it seems reasonable to represent user management
   function as a service function.

   'BNAS-' means some functions have unburdened from traditional
   BNAS,such as user management,Qos,Load Balance and so forth.  It seems
   that traditional BNAS is going to unload all the other extra
   functions from themselves, although now some extra functions are
   still imposed on them.

   Give that SFC is applied in Broadband network, the main SNs may
   cover: User Management, DPI, DFI, Qos, Load Balance, Fast Reroute,
   URL Filter,Firewall.  And the possible order is not as strict as
   above.  The upstream/downstream traffic may go through different
   permutations and combination of these SNs.  For example:

   SFC1: UM

   This SFC stands for the simplest of use case where a public broadband
   subscriber has no restriction in terms of bandwidth, flow capacity,
   access contents etc.

   SFC2: UM--Qos

   This SFC shows some bandwidth restrictions or several priority-based
   schedules are applied in this subscriber.  Almost each home
   subscriber has an corresponding subscribed bandwidth, different
   services from a home have distinctive priority as well.  As a result,
   this is a typical SFC used in internet access from homes.

   SFC3: UM--Qos--LB

   This SFC extends SFC2, which utilizes load balance to unburden one
   path from overload.  This is also a typical senario in broadband
   network,especially in metropolitan area network.

   SFC4: UM--Qos--LB--URL Filter

   Based on SFC3, this SFC gives extra restrictions to the content that
   the subscriber want to access.

   SFC5: UM--Qos

   This is similar to SFC4,except there is no Load Balance.  Another
   difference is that SFC5 offers some restrictions to downstream
   traffic in terms of content.  SFC5 allows some legal or appropriate
   contents to flow to subscribers, while some illegal or inappropriate
   contents are blocking.

3.1.2.  IPv4/IPv6 Coexist Network

   As showed below in figure 4, the main difference between IPv4/IPv6
   native network and IPv4/IPv6 coexist network is whether there exists
   a NAT funtion.  Although in IPv4 native network, there maybe exist
   NAT44 or NAT444 function as a result of limited IPv4 address, we try
   to put this scenario together with other IPv6 transition scenarioes
   in this section and discuss them in detail.

                    Figure 4: IPv4/IPv6 Coexist Network

   Whether NAT stands for NAT44 or NAT64 or NAT46 depends on the the
   Internet Server Provider.  It may be NAT44, which reflects the
   communication between IPv4 private customer IPv4 Server.  Or it may
   be NAT64, which means the communication between IPv6 customer and
   IPv4 Server.  And where NAT is deployed is based on the Internet
   Server Provider as well.  It may be besides BNAS,which stands for
   distributed deployment, or besides CR,which represents central
   deployment.

   Above figure 4 just gives a simple example of a possible deployment
   position in distributed deployment scenario.  Actually, there are
   some other complicated IPv6 transition scenarioes .  And this section
   tries to give some typical examples in IPv4/IPv6 coexist network, and
   conclude a feasible SFC architecture in IPv4/IPv6 coexist network.
   Also, in the following sections, the other SFs emphasized in section
   3.1.1 are not highlighted, just try to keep the diagram simple and
   suitable for the draft's specification.

3.1.2.1.  NAT44

   Figure 5 illustrates in a simple NAT44 scenario how SF-NAT is
   deployed.

   In distributed broadband networks, SNs may be deployed beside BNAS.
   These SNs may contain SF-NAT and other service functions such as
   UM,QOS,Load Balance,etc.

   Here gives an example of possible SFC in IPv4/IPv6 coexist network,
   which combines NAT function with the service functions in native
   IPv4/IPv6 network.

   SFC6: UM--Qos--NAT--LB--URL Filter

   SFC6 combines NAT function with SFC4, and represents the classical
   scenario in IPv4/IPv6 coexist network.  After customers have
   subscribed, apply subscriber-based Qos policy, then transform private
   IPv4 address into public IPv4 address, and do five-tuple load balance
   for the outbound traffic.

   At last, monitor the outbound traffic and decide whether to pass them
   to the internet or block them.

                              Figure 6: NAT64

   NAT64 scenario is similar with the scenario of simple NAT44.  The
   only difference is SF-NAT64 should maintain rules that indicate how
   to translate a des-IPv6-address to an IPv4 address using a specific
   prefix64::/n.  Where the NAT64 is deployed is also determined by
   Internet Server Provider.  This figure is just an example where NAT64
   is located nearby BNAS-.  It also may be situated nearby CR.

3.1.2.3.  DS-Lite

   Figure 7 describes a scenario of DS-lite, which completes IPv4
   communication between IPv4 private customer and IPv4 server across
   IPv6 network.  And the main principle of DS-Lite is to encapsulate
   IPv4 packets in IPv6 Header and forward this IPv4-in-IPv6 packets to
   CGN device and enforce NAT function in this device.

   SFC7: Dslite-Enc---UM---Dslite-Dec---NAT---LB---URL Filter

   When the outbound datagram is received by the CPE, the CPE sends it
   to a specific classifier which determines the datagram should be
   forwarded directly or dealed with DS-Lite process. if the datagram
   should be dealed with DS-Lite process, then the classifier sends the
   datagram within service header encapsulated to Softwire-SN which
   contains SF-Dslite-Encapsulation instance.  In this instance, it
   fulfils DS-Lite encapsulate and then encapsulates overlay header and
   forward this datagram to nexthop in the traditional network.

   Next, the BNAS- receives the processed datagram, the BNAS- sends it
   to a classifier and finds it a legal subscriber and need to be dealed

   with DS-Lite process. then, this datagram is forwarded to SF-Dslite-
   Decapsulation to decapsulate DS-Lite encapsulation.  And next,
   forwarded to SF-NAT to create and maintain the NAT mapping table.
   After that, completes the subsequent SFs.  In other words, BNAS-,
   itself, would not be aware of any stateful sessions.

                              Figure 8: MAP-E

   The main difference between MAP-E and DS-Lite is where NAT happens.
   And the result is that MAP-E realizes NAT on the CPE, and then
   encapsulates translated IPv4 datagram in IPv6 Header and finally
   propagates the IPv4-in-IPv6 datagram in IPv6 tunnel to BNAS device or
   CR device.  So here gives an example of this scenario:

   SFC8: NAT---MAPE-Enc---UM---MAPE-Dec---LB---URL Filter

   In more detail, for outbound traffic in MAP-E SFC scenario, When the
   datagram is received by the home router, the CPE sends it to a
   specific classifier which determines the datagram should be forwarded
   directly or dealed with MAP-E process. if the datagram should be
   dealed with MAP-E process, then the classifier sends the datagram
   within service header encapsulated to the first element of this SFP:
   SF-NAT.  SF-NAT translates the IPv4 datagram and forwards translated
   IPv4 datagram to SF-MAPE-Enc, which encapsulates the datagram with
   the MAP BR IPv6 address in IPv6 encapsulated header and forwards this
   IPv4-in-IPv6 datagram (datagram 2) to the BNAS- device.

   When the BNAS- device receives such an IPv4-in-IPv6 datagram, the
   BNAS- device sends it to a classifier and finds it need to be dealed
   with MAP-E process.  Then the classifier sends the datagram within
   service header encapsulated to SF-MAPE-Dec.  This SF-MAPE-Dec
   decapsulates this datagram, and then propagates the datagram to other
   SFs in this chain.

                Figure 9: Internet access from enterprises

   Internet access from enterprises is another broadband network.  They
   lease some ports or even some devices from Internet Server Provider.
   In addition to external ISP's service functions which is sitted on
   the way to internet, there maybe deploy many service functions in
   internal enterprise network for the sake of the security of
   enterprise network per se.

   Internal service functions may include: Firewall,used for
   transforming private IPv4 address to public IPv4 address,like nat
   function, URL Filter, used for restricting employees from access to
   non-work websites.

   As for external service functions deployed by ISP, a typical service

   function is VPN, like L2VPN,L3VPN,IPsec,etc.  But VPN is mainly used
   for interconnection between geographically separate sites of the same
   VPN, rather than internet access.  Instead, there is a NAT function
   based on SR, converting inner traffic to the outer internet.

   Other external service functions involved in Internet access from
   enterprise network maybe similar to home network, for example,
   DPI,DFI,Qos,Load Balance, URL Filter,Firewall and so on.

   SFC10: URL Filter--FW---NAT---Qos---Load Balance----FW

   Here, you may see two FW functions.  One is in the inner of
   enterprise, which represents the URL constrains from the perspective
   of enterprise.  While the other one is sitted in the ISP network, out
   of the inner enterprise, and stands for the URL restrictions from the
   standpoint of ISP.

3.3.  Internet Access from Campuses

   TBD

3.4.  Added-value Service Access

   To promote their primary service, ISP try to provide value-added
   services to add value to the standard service offering.  Here maybe
   focus on some significant value-added services in broadband network
   such as IPTV,VOIP,etc.

   IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel from CPE to CR.  As a result of that, BRAS cannot
   identify the true IPv4 destination address in this IPv4-in-IPv6
   packets.  And then, BRAS cannot enforce DAA function to manage the
   subscriber more flexibly.

   IPTV is a IP multicast service, in which multi-subscribers should
   receive the same traffic from the multicast source like Content
   Distribution Network.  Supposed there are six IPTV subscribers, from
   STB1 to STB6, they are located in different districts and they all
   need to receive traffic from Program 1.  A possible SFC abstract here
   is :

   SFC11: DPI--Qos1

           |---Qos2

   In SFC11, as for the inbound traffic, there are two different
   outputs, Qos1 and Qos2.  Firstly, traffic from multicast source go
   through DPI, which used for detecting whether the multicast traffic
   are legal or unmalicious.  After that, legal traffic propagate to
   different Qos, and next, each goes through different BNAS- to
   different STB subscirbers separately.

4.  Considerations

4.1.  Service Function Chain Symmetry

   A complete end-to-end access in broadband network should consist of a
   set of service function instances in a specific order.  Such as:

   a.1.  Outbound : UM -> NAT

   Inbound : NAT -> UM

   a.2.  Outbound : SOFTWIRE -> UM -> QoS -> SOFTWIRE -> NAT

   Inbound : NAT -> UM -> QoS -> SOFTWIRE -> SOFTWIRE

   a.3.  Outbound : UM -> FIREWALL6 -> NAT64

   Inbound : FIREWALL4 -> NAT64 -> UM

   etc.

4.2.  Deploying consideration

4.2.1.  Standalone mode

   In broadband networks, service function components are hanging next
   to routers such as CPEs/BNASs/CRs.  All traffics would be received
   and steered by routers.  Routers send the traffic to classifier in
   which traffic that matches classification criteria is forwarded along
   a given SFP to realize the specifications of an SFC.

                        Figure 13: Standalone mode

   Take DS-Lite CGN for example.

   Outbound traffic:

   In the example shown in Figure X, a datagram received by the CPE from
   the host at address 10.0.0.1, using TCP DST port 10000, will be
   translated to a datagram with IPv4 SRC address 192.0.2.1 and TCP SRC
   port 5000 in the Internet.

   When the datagram 1 is received by the CPE, the CPE sent it to a
   specific classifier which determines the datagram should be forwarded
   directly or dealed with DS-Lite process.  Then the classifier sends
   the datagram within service header encapsulated to the first element

   of SFP.  SF-SOFTWIRE encapsulates the datagram in another datagram
   (datagram 2) and forwards it BACK to CPE over the softwire.  The
   datagram 2 would be sent to the Dual-Stack Lite carrier-grade NAT by
   CPE.

   When the BNAS receives datagram 2, the BNAS sends it to a classifier
   and find it need to be dealed with DS-Lite process.  Then the
   classifier send the datagram within service header encapsulated to
   the first element of SFP.

   SF-SOFTWIRE decapsulates the datagram 2 to datagram 1 and forwards it
   SF-NAT, which determines from its NAT table that the datagram
   received on the softwire with TCP SRC port 10000 should be translated
   to datagram 3 with IPv4 SRC address 192.0.2.1 and TCP SRC port 5000.

   The translated datagram would be also sent back to BNAS for next
   forwarding.

   Inbound traffic:

   Figure x shows an inbound message received at the classifer.  When
   the BNAS receives datagram 1, the BNAS sends it to a classifier.
   Then the classifier sends the datagram within service header
   encapsulated to the first element of SFP.  SF- NAT looks up the IP/
   TCP DST information in its translation table.  In the example in
   Figure 3, the NAT changes the TCP DST port to 10000, sets the IP DST
   address to 10.0.0.1, and it will be sent back to BNAS to forwards the
   datagram to the softwire.  The SF-SOFTWIRE of the CPE decapsulates
   the IPv4 datagram inbound softwire datagram and forwards it to the
   host.

4.2.2.  Directly connecting mode

   There is another mode to deploy service function components.  In
   broadband home networks, service function components are directly
   connected to the network.  They are connected straight to a BNAS or
   Routers.

   Under this scenario, it seems like more costly than standalone mode
   during transition period.

                    Figure 14: Directly connecting mode

   Take NAT44 for example.

   Outbound traffic:

   For directly connecting mode, the difference in dealing with traffic



Meng, et al.             Expires January 5, 2015               [Page 20]

   is whether the network steer the traffic loopback.  That means
   service function node could send datagrams directly to the next hop.

   For example, when the outbound datagram is received by the BNAS and
   processed by classifer A and SF-NAT which forward the processed
   datagram straight next to router.

   Inbound traffic:

   It is quite similar with the process of dealing with outbound
   traffic. when the inbound datagram is received by the router and
   processed by classifer B and SF-NAT which forward the processed
   datagram straight next to NAT BNAS.

4.3.  Pool consideration

   In traditional networks, pools are configured in router one by one.
   Pool configuration means these IP addresses in each pool MUST be
   advertised for creating forward routing path to ensures that the
   message is routed to the correct target, especially to inbound
   traffic.  Thus, pool location is a problem we must face to in SFC
   framework.

   In standalone mode shown in figure 6, pool could be configured in the
   classifier beside gateway and advertised by the gateway itself.  The
   classifier would assign IP addresses to service functions for
   creating mapping table.  Both-bound traffic should be forward to
   gateway first and then for NAT treatment in relative service function
   components.

   In Directly connecting mode shown in figure 7, pool could be
   configured in classifier B and advertised by classifier B for
   creating inbound routing path.

   There is a mechanism to manage the address pools centrally.  Pools
   could be assigned to classifiers by management server which is
   handled by Operators centrally.
