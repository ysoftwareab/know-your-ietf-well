Internet-Draft              SIP MIB Modules                    July 2003


1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used to
   manage Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entities, which include User
   Agents, Proxy servers, Redirect servers and Registrars.

3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [2]. Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects
   are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [3], STD 58, RFC 2579 [4] and STD 58,
   RFC 2580 [5].

4. Overview

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) RFC 3261 [7] is an application-
   layer control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying, and
   terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions
   include Internet telephone calls, multimedia distribution, and
   multimedia conferences. This MIB provides some managed objects for
   SIP entities defined in RFC 3261 - User Agent, Proxy Server, Redirect
   Server and Registrar. It is provided as a base for the work within
   the working group to define a MIB. This MIB is intended to provide
   management of the basic SIP entities. It provides for monitoring of
   status and protocol statistics, as well as for configuration of SIP
   entities.

5. Structure of SIP MIB

   This memo specifies four MIB modules.  They are SIP-COMMON-MIB, SIP-
   SERVER-MIB, SIP-UA-MIB and SIP-TC.  SIP-COMMON-MIB contains common
   objects used in all the SIP entities. SIP-SERVER-MIB contains objects
   specific to Registrars, Proxies and Redirect Servers, and SIP-UA-MIB
   includes objects specific to User Agents.  SIP-TC defines the textual

Internet-Draft              SIP MIB Modules                    July 2003


   conventions used throughout MIB modules. The MIB Modules contain
   following groups of objects:

   SIP-COMMON-MIB: Common to all the SIP entities

   o  sipCommonMIBObjects

      *  sipCommonCfgBase: This object group defines configuration
         objects common to all SIP entities including SIP protocol
         version, operational and administrative status, SIP
         organization name, max number of SIP sessions an entity can
         manage, etc.

      *  sipCommonCfgTimer: This object group defines timer
         configuration objects applicable to SIP user agent and SIP
         stateful proxy entities.

      *  sipCommonCfgRetry: This object group defines retry counter
         configuration objects applicable to SIP user agent and SIP
         stateful proxy entities.

      *  sipCommonCfgExpires: This object group defines Expires header
         value configuration objects applicable to SIP user agent and
         SIP stateful proxies

      *  sipCommonStatsSummary: This object group defines a table
         containing the summary statistics objects applicable to all SIP
         entities, including the total number of SIP requests &
         responses in/out, total number of transactions, etc.

      *  sipCommonStatsMethod: This object group defines a table
         containing the per method statistics objects applicable to all
         SIP entities, including the total number of SIP requests for
         the Invite, Ack, Bye, Cancel, Options and /Register methods.

      *  sipCommonStatusCode: This object group defines a table
         indicating the number of SIP responses in/out per class of
         response (1xx, 2xx, etc.)

      *  sipCommonStatsTrans: This object group defines a table
         containing a gauge reflecting the number of transactions
         currently awaiting definitive responses by the managed SIP
         entity.

      *  sipCommonStatsRetry: This object group defines statistic
         objects indicating the number of retries sent on a per method
         basis.

      *  sipCommonStatsOther: This object group defines additional
         statistic objects including a counter of the number of SIP
         requests received with unsupported URIs.

      *  sipCommonNotifObjects: This object group defines
         accessible-for-notify objects that are relate to the SNMP
         notifications defined in this MIB module.

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB also contains notifications, including:

   o  sipStatusCodeNotif: indicates that a specific status code has been
      sent or received by the system.

   o  sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif: indicates that a specific status
      code has been sent or received by the system enough to exceed the
      configured threshold.

   SIP-SERVER-MIB: Groups of objects for Registrars, Proxy and Redirect
   Servers

   o  sipServerMIBObjects

      *  sipServerCfg: This object group defines common server
         configuration objects including the SIP server host address.

      *  sipServerStats: This object group is currently empty and is
         created for future extensions of the SIP MIB.

      *  sipProxyCfg: This object group defines Proxy Server
         configuration objects including the maximum duration in the
         Expires header, the proxy mode of operation (stateless,
         stateful, call stateful), the cancellation of outstanding
         branch requests

      *  sipProxyStats: This object group defines a table containing the
         statistics objects applicable to all SIP Proxy Servers.  It
         includes the number of occurrences of unsupported options being
         specified in received Proxy-Require headers.

      *  sipRedirCfg: This object group is currently empty and is
         created for future extensions of the SIP MIB.

      *  sipRedirStats: This object group is currently empty and is
         created for future extensions of the SIP MIB.

      *  sipRegCfg: This object group is currently empty and is created
         for future extensions of the SIP MIB.

Internet-Draft              SIP MIB Modules                    July 2003


      *  sipRegStats: This object group is currently empty and is
         created for future extensions of the SIP MIB.

   SIP-UA-MIB: Group of objects for User Agents.

   o  sipUAMIBObjects

      *  sipUACfgSipServer: This group specifies SIP server
         configuration objects applicable to SIP user agents including
         the Internet address of the SIP Server to use to proxy or
         redirect calls.

   To conform with this specification, an SNMP agent MUST implement
   SIP-TC, plus the SIP-COMMON-MIB and one of the SIP entity-type-
   specific MIB modules (SIP-SERVER-MIB or SIP-UA-MIB) as applicable for
   each instance of a SIP entity being managed.  If a device has more
   than one SIP entity or multiple instances of the same entity, type it
   MUST implement multiple SIP modules. Section 4.2 describes handling
   of multiple instances in detail.

5.1 Textual Conventions

   The data type SipTransportProtocol is used as Textual Conventions in
   this document.  These Textual Conventions have NO effect on either
   the syntax or the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined
   using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the
   SNMP are necessary to accommodate these Textual Conventions. They are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

5.2 Relationship to the Network Services MIB

   There is a requirement to be able to support multiple instances of
   various SIP MIB modules in the context of a single system having a
   single SNMP agent.

   This requirement is solved by using the framework provided by the
   NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB, RFC 2788 [6]. A device implementing the SIP MIB
   MUST support the NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB and, at a minimum, it MUST
   support the applIndex and applName objects in applTable.  The
   following applName conventions will be adopted:

   o  for a SIP Proxy entity, applName MUST be equal to "sip_proxy"

   o  for a SIP Redirect entity, applName MUST be equal to
      "sip_redirect"

   o  for a SIP Registrar entity, applName MUST be equal to

Internet-Draft              SIP MIB Modules                    July 2003


      "sip_registrar"

   o  for a SIP User Agent entity, applName MUST be equal to "sip_ua"

   o  for any combination of Proxy, Registrar, or Redirect Server being
      managed as a single aggregate entity, the applName for the
      combined server entity MUST reflect the appropriate combination.
      For example, "sip_proxy_redirect" or "sip_proxy_registrar".

   The SNMP agent MAY support any combination of the other attributes in
   applTable.  If the following objects are supported, the object values
   SHOULD be populated as follows:

   o  applVersion: version of the SIP application.

   o  applUptime: value MUST be identical to sipServiceStartTime defined
      in the SIP-COMMON-MIB module,

   o  applOperStatus: value SHOULD reflect the operational status
      defined in sipServiceOperStatus, at least by means of a mapping,

   o  applLastChange: value MUST be identical to sipServiceLastChange
      defined in the SIP-COMMON module.

   Note: There are a number of other objects in the applTable.  They are
   not included for the sake of brevity and for the fact that they do
   not enhance the concept being presented.

   Example 1:

   The tables below illustrate how a system acting as both Proxy and
   Registrar server might be configured to maintain separate SIP-
   COMMON-MIB instances.

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows:

         +-----------+-----------------+----------------------+
         | applIndex |     applName    |    applDescription   |
         +-----------+-----------------+----------------------+
         |     1     |   "sip_proxy"   |   "ACME SIP Proxy"   |
         |     2     | "sip_registrar" | "ACME SIP Registrar" |
         +-----------+-----------------+----------------------+

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have two rows: one for the
   proxy (applIndex=1) and one for the registrar (applIndex=2). The
   SIP-SERVER-MIB tables would, however, only be populated with one row
   indexed by applIndex=1 and applIndex=2 respectively if the server
   provides either proxy or registrar.

   while sipProxyCfgTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated as:

   | applIndex | sipRequestMaxExpires | sipProxyStatefulness | ... |
   +-----------+----------------------+----------------------+-----+

   +-----------+----------------------+----------------------+-----+

   and sipRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated as:

        +-----------+--------------+---------------------+-----+
        | applIndex | sipUserIndex |      sipUserUri     | ... |
        +-----------+--------------+---------------------+-----+

        +-----------+--------------+---------------------+-----+

   Example 2:

   This example illustrates how to represent a system acting as both
   Proxy and Registrar server, where the two entities share a single
   instance of SIP-COMMON-MIB.

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows:

  +-----------+-----------------------+------------------------------+
  | applIndex |        applName       |        applDescription       |
  +-----------+-----------------------+------------------------------+
  |     1     | "sip_proxy_registrar" | "ACME SIP Proxy & Registrar" |
  +-----------+-----------------------+------------------------------+

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have only one row to cover
   both the proxy and the registrar.

        +-----------+--------------+---------------------+-----+

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB assocTable is not considered a requirement
   for SIP systems.  It is not a mandatory group for NETWORK-SERVICES-
   MIB compliance.

   The relationship between the value of applOperStatus and
   sipServiceOperStatus is as follows:

  +----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
  | sipServiceOperStatus | -- corresponds to --> |   applOperstatus  |
  +----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
  |          up          |          -->          |         up        |
  |         down         |          -->          |        down       |
  |       congested      |          -->          |     congested     |
  |      restarting      |          -->          |     restarting    |
  |       quiescing      |          -->          |     quiescing     |
  |        testing       |          -->          |         up        |
  |        unknown       |          -->          | --indeterminate-- |
  +----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+

   If the sipOperStatus is 'unknown' there is no corresponding value of
   applOperStatus.  Therefore, the last known value of applOperStatus

   SHOULD be maintained until the sipOperStatus transitions to a value
   that can be mapped appropriately.

6. Accommodating SIP Extension Methods

   The core set of SIP methods is defined in RFC 3261 [7].  Other
   Internet- Draft documents and RFCs define additional methods.  In the
   future more methods may be defined.  In order to avoid having to
   update the SIP-COMMON-MIB module to accommodate these extension
   methods, there are various extension method tables throughout the MIB
   module. There are no per method objects defined in the other MIB
   modules.

   The sipExtMethodSupportedTable is the main table for listing all of
   the extension methods supported by a system.  The table is
   informational in nature and populated by the system.  Entries cannot
   be added or deleted by a SNMP manager.  The other extension method
   tables in the MIB are augmentations of this table.

   The other extension method tables defined in the SIP-COMMON-MIB are:
   sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable, sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodTable,
   sipStatsExtMethodTable, and sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodTable.

           DESCRIPTION
                "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common MIB module.
                 This module defines objects which MAY be common to all
                 SIP entities.

                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 3261 (June
                 2002).

                 This MIB is defined for managing objects which are
                 common to SIP User Agents (UAs), Proxy and Redirect
                 Servers, and Registrars.  Objects specific to each of
                 these entities MAY be managed using entity specific
                 MIBs defined in other modules.

                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or
                 redirects the request.

                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either
                 responding to them or passing them on to other
                 servers, possibly after modification.

                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. Unlike
                 a Proxy Server it does not initiate requests.  Unlike
                 a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.

                 A Registrar Server accepts REGISTER requests.
                 A Registrar Server is typically co-located with a
                 Proxy or Redirect Server.

                 Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2003). This version
                 of this MIB module is part of RFC XXXX; see the RFC
                 itself for full legal notices."

                SIP Proxy Servers.

                A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server and
                comprises all messages from the first request sent from
                the client to the server up to a final (non-1xx) response
                sent from the server to the client.

                If the request is INVITE and the final response is a non-2xx,
                the transaction also include an ACK to the response.  The ACK
                for a 2xx response to an INVITE request is a separate
                transaction.

                The branch ID parameter in the Via header field values
                serves as a transaction identifier.

                A transaction is identified by the CSeq sequence number
                within a single call leg.  The ACK request has the same
                CSeq number as the corresponding INVITE request, but
                comprises a transaction of its own.

                In the case of a forked request, all branches count as a
                single transaction.

                For a transaction stateless Proxy Server, this counter
                is always 0."

           DESCRIPTION
                "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA)
                 MIB module.

                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 3261 (June
                 2002).

                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or
                 redirects the request.

                 Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2003). This version
                 of this MIB module is part of RFC XXXX; see the RFC

                    responding to them or passing them on to other
                    servers, possibly after modification.

                    A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and
                    returns zero or more addresses to that client.
                    Unlike a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.

                    A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER
                    requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with a
                    Proxy or Redirect Server.

8. Changes from Previous Draft Revisions

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-06

   o  General

      *  Minor editorial changes in the Textual Conventions section.

   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB

      *  sipStatusCodeValue SYNTAX changed from INTEGER to Unsigned32.

      *  Optional sipCommonNotifObjectsGroup explicitly added to
         MODULE-COMPLIANCE.

      *  Removed OBJECT refinement for sipStatusCodeRowStatus added to

         compliance in previous revision.  SMIC MIB compiler issues
         required it to be commented out. Instead, simply removed it.

   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB

      *  Removed OID placeholders: sipRedirCfg, sipRedirStats.
         sipRegCfg and sipRegStats OID values subsequently changed as a
         result.

   o  SIP-UA-MIB

      *  Removed OBJECT refinement for sipUACfgSipServerStatus added to
         compliance in previous revision.  SMIC MIB compiler issues
         required it to be commented out. Instead, simply removed it.

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-05

   o  Front paper/Back paper and General changes

      *  Removed all references and special handling of SIP INFO method
         Removed references and objects specific to RFC 2976: INFO will
         be treated as any SIP extension method.

      *  Changed requirements verbs from lowercase to uppercase wherever
         appropriate.

      *  Added RFC Editor notes.

      *  Updated all REFERENCE clauses and DESCRIPTIONS from RFC 2543 to
         RFC 3261.

      *  Explained the approach taken for extension methods that might
         be defined in the future.

      *  Defined a mapping of sipServiceOperStatus to applOperStatus.

      *  Enhanced Security section with details on various objects.

      *  Added descriptive language to various Entry objects regarding
         the expected persistence of data across system restarts.

   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB

      *  Removed sipTransactionTable after input from SIP community.

      *  Made all extension method tables augmentations of
         sipExtMethodSupportedTable.  This resulted in the removal of
         the following objects: sipCfgTimerExtMethodName,

         sipCfgRetryExtMethodName, sipStatsExtMethodName,
         sipStatsRetryExtMethodName.

      *  sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode default value changed to
         'triggered'.

      *  sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif was replaced by two
         notifications: sipStatusCodeThreshExceededOutNotif &
         sipStatusCodeThreshExceededInNotif.

      *  Re-arranged the enumerated value of sipServiceOperStatus;
         making 'unknown' the first value.   Added some words to the
         DESCRIPTION of that object stating the values are not based on
         anything in the SIP standard.

      *  Clarified rules for capitalization of sipExtMethodName.

      *  All counters in the MIB are consistent with respect to
         resetting to zero.  No counters can be reset to zero. Entries
         in sipStatusCodesTable can simply be created or destroyed - no
         ability to set to 'notInService' where there was the question/
         possibility of resetting the counters to zero.
         sipStatsExtMethodTable no longer has its own RowStatus
         object, so it too can no longer be set to 'notInService where
         there was the question/possibility of resetting the counters to
         zero. sipStatsExtMethodTable rows are augmentations of
         sipExtMethodSupportedEntry.

      *  OBJECT refinement for sipStatusCodeRowStatus added to
         compliance.

      *  Clarified the relationship between
         sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode and
         sipCommonStatusCodeNotifSend.

      *  Explained the existence of sipNotifApplIndex object better.

      *  sipCfgExpiresStatusCodeValue syntax changed from INTEGER to
         Unsigned32.

      *  sipEntityType object added to sipCommonCfgTable.

      *  All accessible-for-notify objects are moved into
         sipCommonNotifObjects group.  OIDs for actual notifications are
         re-assigned as a result.

      *  sipNotifSequenceNumber accessible-for-notify object added as a
         way for managers to gain insight into possible missed

         notifications.  It is bound to each notification defined in the
         MIB.

      *  New notifications related to SIP service operational status are
         added: sipServiceColdStart, sipServiceWarmStart, &
         sipServiceLastChanged.

      *  New object sipServiceNotifEnable added to control the new SIP
         related notifications.

      *  Minor object descriptor changes: sipStatusCodesTable renamed to
         sipStatusCodeClassesTable SipStatusCodesEntry renamed to
         SipStatusCodeClassesEntry sipStatusCodesEntry renamed to
         sipStatusCodeClassesEntry sipCommonStatusCodeTable renamed to

         sipCommonStatusCodeNotifInterval renamed to

      *  Removed all INFO method specific objects: sipCfgRetryInfo,
         sipStatsInfoIns, sipStatsInfoOuts, & sipStatsRetryInfos

      *  Clarifying words added to sipStatusCodeNotifTable DESCRIPTION
         to explain why it's a seperate table from sipStatusCodesTable.

   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB

      *  Deleted objects related to 'action' parameter. RFC 3261 section
         10.2 deprecates the 'action' parameter deleted 3 objects:
         sipServerContactDfltAction, sipServerRespectUAAction,
         sipContactAction.

      *  Deleted pgp-related objects. RFC 3261 section 23 deprecates use
         of pgp deleted 3 objects: sipProxyAuthPgpAlgorithm,
         sipPgpPrivateKey, sipPgpVersion.

      *  Removed sipProxyStateTimeout object. Timers G and timer H have
         been introduced in RFC 3261 for this purpose (see RFC 3261
         section 17.2.1).

      *  Updated description clause of sipProxyStatefulness. The 3
         definitions of stateless/statefulness now match the text in RFC
         3261.

      *  Changed DEFVAL for object sipProxyProvideAlternatives. Changed
         DEFVAL to true to align with RFC 3261 that states that 485
         responses SHOULD contain a contact header & 303 MAY... and
         updated REFERENCE clause to "RFC 3261 Sections 13.2.2.2 and
         16.5".

      *  Removed basic authentication value from sipProxyAuthMethod
         object Per section 22 of rfc 3261, deprecated.

      *  Changed SYNTAX of sipProxyNonceLifeTime from Integer32 to

      *  sipInviteTimeout was removed from the MIB.  See below regarding
         new sipCommonCfgExpires objects.  They provide equivalent
         functionality with extensibility beyond INVITE.

      *  sipCommonCfgExpires OID subtree added.  Per method Expires
         configuration objects were added there. This new high-level OID
         was placed under the existing sipCommonCfgRetry OID and
         therefore, caused the OIDs for the subsequent groups to change
         (incrementing by one).

      *  Objects from tables under sipCommonCfgExpires were added to a
         new OBJECT-GROUP sipCommonConfigExpiresGroup, and that group
         was listed as optional in sipCommonCompliance.

      *  Minor DESCRIPTION change for sipCommonCfgEntry.  No behavior
         change.

      *  sipServiceOperStatus SYNTAX changed. New values added:
         congested & quiescing Old values removed: halted The order of
         the enumeration was altered as well.

      *  sipServiceAdminStatus SYNTAX changed. New values added: noop,
         up, down, quieseSessions, and quieseApplications Old values
         removed: shutdown, restart, stop, rts. These changes were made
         based on comments from last call reviewer and general known
         ambiguities in the previous design of the object.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipServiceStartTime.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipServiceStartTime.

      *  Clarification of behavior for sipPortStatus while row is
         'active'

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipUriSupportedTable.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTIONs of sipFtrSupportedTable,
         sipFtrSupportedEntry, and sipFtrSupported. Specifically, IETF
         standard features and non-standard features are now represented
         by this table.  Only non-standard features were mentioned in
         prior revisions of the draft.

      *  Reference to usage of RFC 2788 applIndex moved from
         sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable to
         sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry. This was the convention for
         other table/entry definitions in the MIB, so these objects were
         previously unconventional.

      *  DEFVAL removed from sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer.  The generic
         nature of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being
         able to specify a particular default value.

      *  Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from
         sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer, a value for that object must be
         specified when creating a sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry.  The
         description of sipCfgTimerExtMethodStatus was updated to
         reflect this.

      *  sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodTable is now properly defined under
         sipCommonCfgRetry OID space instead of under sipCommonCfgTimer
         OID space.

      *  DEFVAL removed from sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry.  The generic
         nature of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being
         able to specify a particular default value.

      *  Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from

         specified when creating a sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodEntry.  The
         description of sipCfgRetryExtMethodStatus was updated to
         reflect this.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipSummaryTotalTransactions. Specifically, the object is not
         applicable to stateless SIP proxy servers and the object should
         always return a value of 0 if implemented by a stateless proxy.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipStatsExtMethodStatus.

      *  sipStatsOtherClassesIns and sipStatsOtherClassesOuts counter
         objects were added to sipStatusCodesTable to handle possible
         future classes of response status codes.

      *  Text referring specifically to Redirect Server in
         sipStatsRedirClassIns and sipStatsRedirClassOuts was removed.

      *  Text defining protocol behavior in sipStatsServerFailClassIns,
         sipStatsServerFailClassOuts, sipStatsGlobalFailClassIns, and
         sipStatsGlobalFailClassOuts was removed.

      *  sipCommonStatusCodeNotifInterval SYNTAX changed from TimeTicks
         to Unsigned32 w/ a UNITS of "seconds" added to the definition.
         DEFVAL clause changed accordingly.

      *  sipStatusCodeNotifTo, sipStatusCodeNotifFrom,

         sipStatusCodeNotifCallId, and sipStatusCodeNotifCSeq all had
         clarifying changes to their DESCRIPTIONs.  Specifically, the
         header name will be part of the object value and example values
         were given.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipCurrentTransTable
         and sipTransactionTable.  Specifically, these tables are not
         applicable to transaction stateless SIP Proxy Servers.

      *  Minor gramatical change to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipCurrentTransEntry.

      *  sipTransMethod and sipTransActivityInfo objects were added to
         sipTransactionTable while sipTransCallingPartyContentType and
         sipTransCalledPartyContentType were removed.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipTransState.
         Specifically, noting that not all values of the object are
         applicable to all transaction types.

      *  sipTransTo, sipTransFrom, sipTransCallId, and sipTransCSeq all
         had clarifying changes to their DESCRIPTIONs. Specifically, the
         header name will be part of the object value and example values
         were given.

      *  Minor gramatical change to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipOtherStatsEntry.

      *  sipCommonStatusCodeIns and sipCommonStatusCodeOuts objects were
         added to the varbind of sipStatusCodeNotif.

      *  Appropriate changes were made to sipCommonStatsGroup
         OBJECT-GROUP based on objects being added and/or removed from
         the MIB.

   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB

      *  CONTACT-INFO "SIP MIB email" changed to sip@ietf.org

      *  The statement "Unlike a Proxy server it does not initiate
         requests." was removed from where a Redirect Server is defined
         in the MIB's DESCRIPTION.

      *  sipServerMIBNotifs OID removed. No notifications were ever
         defined under this subtree.

      *  Clarifying text added to all of the Table DESCRIPTIONS stating
         that the value of applIndex used in this MIB corresponds to the

9. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB

         The following read-write object is used to control the overall
         SIP service in any SIP entity:

            sipServiceAdminStatus

         If this object is SET maliciously, it may result in unwanted
         operational status, or a failure to obtain SIP services.

         The following read-write and read-create objects are used to
         control the behavior of the SIP protocol as exhibited by a SIP
         entity:

            sipOrganization, sipRequestUriHostMatching, sipCfgTimerA,
            sipCfgTimerB, sipCfgTimerC, sipCfgTimerD, sipCfgTimerE,
            sipCfgTimerF, sipCfgTimerG, sipCfgTimerH, sipCfgTimerI,
            sipCfgTimerJ, sipCfgTimerK, sipCfgTimerT1, sipCfgTimerT2,
            sipCfgTimerT4, sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer, sipCfgRetryInvite,
            sipCfgRetryBye, sipCfgRetryCancel, sipCfgRetryRegister,
            sipCfgRetryOptions, sipCfgRetryFinalResponse,
            sipCfgRetryNonFinalResponse, sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry,
            sipCfgExpiresInvite, sipCfgExpiresRegister,
            sipCfgExpiresHeaderMethod, sipCfgExpiresHeaderValue,
            sipCfgExpiresStatusCodeStatus





Lingle, et al.         Expires December 30, 2003              [Page 108]

Internet-Draft              SIP MIB Modules                    July 2003


         If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in
         incorrect or unwanted protocol operation.

         The following read-create object is used to configure the
         status code statistics that will be monitored by the SIP
         entity:

            sipStatusCodeRowStatus

         If this object is SET maliciously, it may result in an over
         allocation of resources in a system for the purpose of
         accumulating and maintaining statistics.

         The following read-write objects are used to configure the
         behavior of certain SNMP notifications potentially generated by
         a SIP entity:

            sipStatusCodeNotifSend, sipStatusCodeNotifEmitMode,
            sipStatusCodeNotifThresh, sipStatusCodeNotifInterval,
            sipServiceNotifEnable

         If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in a system
         and/or network performance impact due to the generation of SNMP
         notifications.

   o  SIP-UA-MIB

         The following read-create objects are used to configure the
         Internet address of SIP servers a SIP User Agent will use to
         proxy/redirect SIP calls:

            sipUACfgSipServerAddrType, sipUACfgSipServerAddr,
            sipUACfgSipServerStatus.

         If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in unwanted
         operation, or a failure to obtain SIP services from the user
         agent prospective or even theft of service. In particular,
         setting the SipUACfgSipServerStatus object instance to the
         'destroy' value may result in service disruption.

   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB

         The following read-create objects are managed by Registrar
         Servers and contain sensitive or private information about the
         address of record of registered users.

            sipUserUri & sipUserTableRowStatus




Lingle, et al.         Expires December 30, 2003              [Page 109]

Internet-Draft              SIP MIB Modules                    July 2003


         The sensitivity of these objects depends on the role that
         Registrar Servers play in the SIP service. In some cases, these
         objects, if SET maliciously, may allow unregistered users to
         steal service, or may prevent registered users from accessing
         the SIP service.

         The following read-write objects, if SET maliciously will have
         an immediate serious impact on the service:

            sipServerHostAddrType & sipServerHostAddr

         These objects specify the host part of the URI for the server
         providing the SIP resource and it is widely used by SIP servers
         in numerous header lines and field. For e.g., the host address
         may be used with the Request-URI to check if the server is the
         one resolved by the Request-URI, therefore determining whether
         to process or forward the request in the case of outbound
         proxies, or, as an another common example, it is used by Proxy
         Servers acting as strict routers to rewrite the Request-URI.
         Setting these objects with improper values may result in
         serious service interference or failure.

         sipRequestMaxExpires and sipRegMaxContactExpiryDuration: if set
         to a zero value and either SIP requests contain an Expires
         header or Contact header contain an expires parameter, may
         cause the server to never create bindings associated with an
         address of record (case of REGISTER request) or may cause
         server to expire and cancel invitations (case of INVITE
         request).

         sipProxyStatefulness: changing the value of this object affects
         how transaction states are being handled the Proxy Server and
         may result in call feature or service changes.

         sipProxyAuthMethod: this object specifies at a maximum what the
         authentication methods that may be used by a server. If this
         object is SET maliciously, it may alter how the level of
         security used by the server to generate requests and may
         compromise the network security policies.

         sipRegAllowThirdParty: depending on the authentication policy
         associated with registration services, setting this object
         maliciously to 'true' may allow theft of identity or service.

         sipProxyAuthRealm: if this object is SET improperly, and if the
         HTTP Digest authentication method is used, it may result in
         clients being unable to authenticate and ultimately, in the
         server denying service.

Internet-Draft              SIP MIB Modules                    July 2003


         The remaining read-write objects, if SET maliciously may have
         some effect on the service:

         SipProxySendsCancel: this is a configuration object defining
         how a certain class of proxy servers (forking proxies) handle
         cancellation of outstanding branch requests. If this object was
         set to true and is maliciously changed to false, the impact is
         considered moderate: the forking proxy may simply terminate the
         outstanding branches at a later phase, either when a
         transaction timer expires or when subsequent messages arrive
         from the outstanding branches.

         sipProxyRecordRoute: setting this object to true may cause
         additional SIP traffic to cross the proxy server and may result
         in message avalanches.

         The threats posed by the following read-write objects can
         either be mitigated by other configuration settings like
         read-only objects or they are considered to cause additional
         server operations without immediate impact on the server like
         additional location look-ups (sipProxyProvideAlternatives),
         additional traffic due to expiration of nonce
         (sipProxyNonceLifeTime).

            sipProxyForwardAll1xx, sipProxyRecursion,
            sipProxyProvideAlternatives sipProxyNonceLifeTime, and
            sipRegDfltRegActiveInterval

         Some of the readable objects in the MIB modules (i.e., objects
         with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
         sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is
         thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
         these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
         objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

         The following object values may contain private or confidential
         customer information like first name, last name, customer
         identification, location, company affiliation, the time the
         information was updated, etc.

            SipContactDisplayName, SipContactURI, and
            SipContactLastUpdated.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
