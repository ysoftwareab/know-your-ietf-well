Abstract

   The MIPv6 bootstrapping procedure allows the mobile node to
   dynamically discover its home prefix using an IKEv2 exchange.  Since
   the home prefix is not statically configured on the mobile node,
   there is a need to specify a mechanism for the mobile node to detect
   if it is on its home link.  This document specifies one such
   mechanism.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   A Mobile IPv6 node requires a Home Agent address, a home address, and
   IPsec security associations with its Home Agent before it can start
   utilizing Mobile IPv6 service.  The base MIPv6 RFC [RFC3775] requires
   that some or all of these are statically configured.  The MIPv6
   bootstrapping work specified in [RFC5026] describes how the MN can
   acquire such information dynamically.


3.  Proposed method

   This document proposes using the information available from Router
   Advertisements on the local link and the configuration information
   acquired using the IKEv2 exchange as specified in [RFC5026] to
   determine whether or not it has attached to its home link.  It uses
   the Prefix Information Option(s) received in the Router
   Advertisements and the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX configuration payload
   received from the HA.  The MN performs this home link detection
   procedure by following the steps described in Section 4.


4.  Mobile Node Operation

   When an MN arrives on a new link it performs the following steps to
   determine if it is on the home link.
   o  The MN sends out a Router Solicitation
   o  The MN receives a Router Advertisement in response with one or
      more Prefix Information Options as specified in [RFC4861].
   o  The MN autoconfigures an address from one of the received prefixes
      that have the autonomous address configuration flag set.  This
      address is referred to as the Current MN Address (CMA)
   o  The MN stores all the prefix(es) received along with their prefix
      lengths in the RA in a conceptual list called the Current Link
      Prefix List (CLPL)
   o  The MN uses the CMA to initiate the bootstrapping procedure
      described in [RFC5026].  The MN MUST include the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX
      attribute in the CFG_REQUEST message.
   o  The MN receives the home prefix and the corresponding prefix
      length from the HA contained in the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute in
      the CFG_REPLY message.  The MN stores it in a conceptual variable

      called the HomePrefix.
   o  The MN iterates through the CLPL and compares HomePrefix to each
      of the entries there in turn.
   o  If one (or more) of the entries in the CLPL matches the
      HomePrefix, the MN can determine that it has attached to its home
      link
   o  If none of the entries in the CLPL matches the HomePrefix, the MN
      can determine that it has not attached to its home link
