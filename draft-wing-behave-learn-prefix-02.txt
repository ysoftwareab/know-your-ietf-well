   communicate with those IPv4 hosts through an IPv6/IPv4 translator.
   The IPv6 application can send an IPv6 packet through the translator
   if it knows the IPv6 prefix of the IPv6/IPv4 translator.  In many
   IPv6/IPv4 translation deployments, that IPv6 prefix is not fixed;
   rather, the prefix is chosen by the network operator.  This
   specification provides three methods for a host to learn the IPv6
   prefix of its IPv6/IPv4 translator.

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator         May 2009


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   AFT:  Address Family Translator.  A device that translates between IP
   address families.

   DNS64:  The function of synthesizing an AAAA record from an A record
   (also called "DNS rewriting" or "DNS-ALG"), described in
   [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64].

   LIR Prefix:  A prefix assigned to an IPv6/IPv4 translator that uses
   the same LIR (Local Internet Registry) prefix as assigned to the
   network by that network's local Internet registry.

   Edge router:  The routers with some interfaces which attach to the
   same multicast link with some hosts.


2.  Introduction

   Certain applications, operating in certain translation scenarios, can
   benefit from knowing the IPv6 prefix of their IPv6/IPv4 translator.
   First, the host must be operating in an IPv6-initiated scenario with
   a local translator.  The BEHAVE charter [Charter] describes these as
   Scenario 1, "IPv6 network to IPv4 Internet", and Scenario 5, "An IPv6
   network to an IPv4 network".  Learning the prefix is useful for both
   stateful translation and stateless translation.

   With those scenarios, the IPv6 host usually performs a DNS AAAA query
   which is processed by a DNS64 server.  The DNS64 server generates a
   synthetic AAAA response, when necessary.  This synthetic AAAA
   response contains the prefix of the IPv6/IPv4 translator.  When the
   IPv6 host sends a packet to that address returned in the AAAA
   response, the packet is routed to the translator which translates it
   to IPv4.  This functionality is transparent to the IPv6 host, for the
   most part.

   Second, the IPv6 application obtains an IPv4 address literal via a
   means outside of DNS, and wants to communicate with that IPv4
   address.  So far, the authors have identified the following
   applications which can benefit knowing the IPv6 prefix of the host's
   IPv6/IPv4 translator:

   o  host-based DNSSEC validation (Section 4.3 of
      [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64])

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator         May 2009


   o  BitTorrent (Section 2.2 of [I-D.wing-behave-nat64-referrals])

   o  multicast translation (Section 4 of [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46])

   o  URI schemes with host IPv4 address literals rather than domain
      names (e.g., http://192.0.2.1, ftp://192.0.2.1, imap://192.0.2.1,
      ipp://192.0.2.1)).

   o  In the absence of an FTP ALG in the IPv6/IPv4 translator, IPv6 FTP
      clients that conect to an IPv4 FTP server which does not support
      EPSV [RFC2428].

   When an IPv6/IPv4 translator is used with an LIR prefix (rather than
   the well-known prefix), it is necessary for such applications to
   learn the IPv6 prefix (and length) of the translator so that the
   application can create an IPv6 packet that will be routed to the
   translator and be translated to IPv4.


3.  Mechanisms to Learn the IPv6 Prefix and Length

   Both the IPv6 prefix of the translator and the prefix length of the
   translator need to be learned.  With that information, the
   application can generate an appropriate IPv6 address that will be
   routed to the translator for the translator to process.

   The host can learn the necessary information using DNS, DHCP, or
   Router Alert, as described in the following sections.

      Issue:  If a conflict exists between DNS, DHCP, or RA, which
      should take precedence?  Should we choose one mechanism??

3.1.  Using DNS

   This specification defines a new U-NAPTR [RFC4848] application to
   discover the translator's IPv6 prefix and length.  The input domain
   name is the exact same as would be used for a reverse DNS lookup,
   derived from the host's IPv6 in the ".ip6.arpa." tree and follows the
   construction rules in Section 2.5 of [RFC3596].  This is shortened to
   20 labels (representing a /64 network prefix) and, if DNS returns an
   error is shortened to 16 labels (representing a /48 network prefix).

   If an IPv6/IPv4 translator is present on the network, the successful
   result of one of those queries will produce a NAPTR record with the
   desired service tag "TRANSLATE64:" which contains the IPv6 prefix and
   prefix length of the translator, separated by a "/" (the same syntax
   as specified in Section 2.3 of [RFC4291]).

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator         May 2009


   For example, a host with the IP address 2001:db8:1:2:3:4:567:89ab
   would first send an NAPTR query for
   3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA (20 elements,
   representing a /64 network prefix).  If that fails (returns
   NXDOMAIN), it would send an NAPTR query for
   2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA (16 elements, representing a
   /48 network prefix).

      Note:  Both /64 and /48 prefix lengths are shown in this version
      of the document for illustrative purposes.  The number of elements
      of this query will depend on the prefix length(s) defined by the
      BEHAVE working group for a translator.  If the BEHAVE working
      group decides that all translators will have a certain prefix
      length, then only one DNS query is sent.

   If the host needs to authenticate the prefix it just learned (e.g.,
   because the host is running a DNSSEC validator) the host performs the
   additional authentication steps described in Section 4.

3.2.  Using DHCP

   A new DHCP option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_DHCP, is defined.  It contains
   the IPv6 prefix and its length.

   In order to conserve space, it is RECOMMENDED that only the
   significant bits of the IPv6 prefix be sent in the DHCP option.

   If the host needs to authenticate the prefix it just learned (e.g.,
   because the host is running a DNSSEC validator) the host performs the
   additional authentication steps described in Section 4.

3.3.  Using IPv6 Router Advertisements (RA)

   The IPv6 prefix and the prefix length can be advertised to IPv6 hosts
   by routers in Router Advertisement (RA) messages [RFC4861].

           Figure 2: using RA message to learn prefix and length

   In the scenario where the IPv6 hosts attach to the same multicast
   link as the translator (i.e., IPv6-A in Figure 2), the translator can
   transmit the IPv6 prefix and the length to IPv6 hosts in the RA
   messages advertised periodically or in the responses to valid Router
   Solicitation messages.

   In the scenarios where IPv6 hosts are attached to a different
   multicast link than the translator (i.e., IPv6-B in Figure 2), the
   IPv6 prefix and the prefix length could be manually configured for
   edge routers in the IPv6 domain such as router-B.  Either the
   translator can use the IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol, e.g., OSPF,
   ISIS, RIP) to announce the IPv6 prefix and the prefix length to edge
   routers in the IPv6 domain.  Thus edge routers can transfer the IPv6
   prefix and the length to IPv6 hosts in the RA messages advertised
   periodically or in the responses to valid Router Solicitation
   messages.

   This mechanism requires extensions to both the RA message of Neighbor
   Discovery protocol [RFC4861] and IGP allowing the IPv6 prefix and
   prefix length to be communicated to IPv6 hosts or routers.

   In the extension of RA messages, a new option type,
   OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_RA, is defined.  It contains the IPv6 prefix and
   its length.

                 Figure 3: RA option OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_RA

   The definition of each field is similar to OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_DHCP of
   Section 3.2.

   Extending OSPF requires defining a new TLV type, TLV_AFT_PREFIX, of
   Router Information LSA (Link State Advertisement) to transfer the
   IPv6 prefix and the prefix length.  The format of TLV_AFT_PREFIX is
   the same as OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_DHCP of Section 3.2.

   Extending other IGPs (e.g., ISIS, RIP) will be discussed in a future
   version of this document.

   If the host needs to authenticate the prefix it just learned (e.g.,
   because the host is running a DNSSEC validator) the host performs the
   additional authentication steps described in Section 4.


4.  Authenticating the Learned Prefix

   In some cases (e.g., a host performing DNSSEC validation), the host
   needs to authenticate the translator's IPv6 prefix learned via one of
   the mechanisms described earlier.  To allow such authentication the
   operator of the translator first creates a PTR record for the
   translator (with 0's for the elements after the translator's IPv6
   prefix) which points to a hostname.  The hostname has a signed AAAA
   record for the same 0-padded IPv6 address returned by the PTR query.
   Once those configuration steps are done, a host can validate the
   translator's IPv6 prefix by performing the following steps:

   a.  The host sends a DNS PTR query for the IPv6 address of the
       translator (for "ipv6.arpa"), using 0 for the elements after the
       prefix length.  This will return the fully-qualified hostname of
       that translator device.

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator         May 2009


   b.  Verify the full-qualified hostname is on the host's configured
       list of authorized translators (e.g.,
       seattle.translator.example.net).

   c.  Send a DNS AAAA query for that hostname.

   d.  Verify the AAAA response matches the IPv6 address obtained in
       step 1.

   e.  Perform DNSSEC validation of the AAAA response.

   For example, if the translator's IPv6 prefix length is /48, the host
   would send a PTR query for 2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.ARPA
   which would return a hostname, seattle.translator.example.net.  The
   host verifies that seattle.translator.example.net is on its
   configured list of authorized translators, as maintained in a text
   file.  The host sends an AAAA query for
   seattle.translator.example.net and verifies the AAAA response
   contains the same IPv6 address.  The host then validates the DNSSEC
   signature for seattle.translator.example.net.


5.  Security Considerations

   After learning the IPv6 prefix of its translator by following the
   procedures in this specification, the IPv6 host will utilize this
   information for subsequent actions (e.g., sending a packet to it, or
   using that information to synthesize DNS records or to perform DNSSEC
   validation).  If an attacker provides a fraudulent IPv6 to the IPv6
   host, the attacker can become on-path for traffic to/from that IPv6
   host and preform passive or active eavesdropping or traffic analysis.
   To protect against this attack, it is RECOMMENDED that IPv6 hosts be
   configured with the names of authorized translators and RECOMMENDED
   that IPv6 hosts uses DNSSEC to validate that name matches the IPv6
   prefix learned via DNS, DHCPv6 or RA message, as described in
   Section 4.


6.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv6 option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_DHCP, and RA option,
   OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_RA, needs to be assigned by IANA.

   A new TLV type, TLV_AFT_PREFIX, of Router Information LSA for OSPF
   needs to be assigned by IANA.

   The new NAPTR Application Service tag "TRANSLATE64" is registered
   with IANA.

Appendix A.  For future study

A.1.  multi-homed hosts

   A multi-homed host may have different translation devices available
   on each of its networks, and can learn those via DNS, DHCP, or RA.

   When using DNS to learn the translator's prefix (Section 3.1) or
   using DNS to authenticate the translator prefix (Section 4, it is
   possible a split horizon DNS exists.  Such a split DNS requires the
   host to query the DNS server associated with that network prefix as
   described in [I-D.savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection].

A.2.  Unicast and multicast translators

   It may be necessary to use different prefixes for unicast, any source
   multicast (ASM), and source-specific multicast (SSM) (Section 2 of
   [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46]).

Appendix B.  Changes

B.1.  Changes from -01 to -02

   o  provided another method of using RA message for a host to learn
      its translator's IPv6 prefix and length

   o  added IPv4 address literals in URIs and multicast as benefactors
      for learning the translator's prefix.

   o  added FTP interworking using PASV

   o  clarified which Scenarios this applies to, and that this is for
      stateful and stateless.

B.2.  Changes from -00 to -01

   o  made clearer this is for NAT64 prefix (changed title and some
      text).

   o  changed from querying for "_aft_prefix" TXT record to querying
      ipv6.arpa NAPTR record.

   o  BitTorrent is another application that benefits from knowing the
      NAT64 prefix; previously only DNSSEC was listed.

   o  changed to standards track.
