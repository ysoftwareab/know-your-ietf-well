Introduction



    With the spread of low-cost computer systems and Internet

    connectivity, the demand for local mail servers had been rising.

    Many people now want to operate a mail server on a system which has

    only an intermittent connection to a service provider.  If the

    system has a static IP address, the [ESMTP] [ETRN] command can be

    used.  However, systems with dynamic IP addresses (which are very

    common with low-cost connections) have no widely-deployed solution.



    This memo proposes a new service, On-Demand Mail Relay, which is a

    profile of [ESMTP], providing for a secure, extensible, easy to

    implement approach to the problem.

1.  Conventions Used in this Document



    Because the client and server roles reverse during the session, to

    avoid confusion, the terms "customer" and "provider" will be used in

    place of "client" and "server", although of course this protocol may

    be useful in cases other than commercial service providers and

    customers.



    In examples, "P:" is used to indicate lines sent by the provider,

    and "C:" indicates those sent by the customer.  Line breaks within a

    command are for editorial purposes only.



    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"

    in this document are to be interpreted as defined in [KEYWORDS].





2.  Description



    On-Demand Mail Relay is a restricted profile of SMTP which runs on

    port 366.  The initial client and server roles are short-lived, as

    the point is to allow the intermittently-connected host to request

    mail held for it by a service provider.



    The customer initiates a connection to the provider, authenticates,

    and requests its mail.  The roles of client and server then reverse,

    and normal [ESMTP] proceeds.



    The provider has an On-Demand Mail Relay process listening for

    connections on port 366.  This process does not need to be a full

    SMTP server.  It does need to be an SMTP client with access to the

    outgoing mail queues, and as a server implement the EHLO, AUTH,

    ATRN, and QUIT commands.



    An MTA normally has a mail client component which processes the

    outgoing mail queues, attempting to send mail for particular

    domains, based on time or event (such as new mail being placed in

    the queue, or receipt of an ETRN command by the SMTP server

    component).  The On-Demand Mail Relay service processes the outgoing

    queue not on a timer or new mail creation, but on request.



    The provider side has normal SMTP server responsibilities, including

    generation of relay or failure DSNs as needed.

3.  States



    The On-Demand Mail Relay service has three states: an initial state,

    an authenticated state, and a reversed state.  The state progression

    is illustrated in the following diagram:



---------------------------

!      initial state      !

---------------------------

  !             !

QUIT           AUTH

  !             !

  !             V

  !      -----------------------

  !      ! authenticated state !

  !      -----------------------

  !       !            !

  !      QUIT         ATRN

  !       !            !

  !       !            V

  !       !      ------------------

  !    termination    !

  ---------------------





3.1.  Initial State



    In the initial state, the provider is the server and the customer is

    the client.  Three commands are valid:  EHLO, AUTH, and QUIT.





3.1.1.  EHLO



    The EHLO command is the same as in [ESMTP].  The response must

    include AUTH and ATRN.





3.1.2.  AUTH



    The AUTH command is specified in [AUTH].  The AUTH command uses a

    [SASL] mechanism to authenticate the session.  The session is not

    considered authenticated until a success response to AUTH has been

    sent.









Gellens                  Expires December 1998                  [Page 3]

Internet Draft              On-Demand Mail Relay              June 1998





    For interoperability, implementations MUST support the CRAM-MD5

    mechanism [CRAM].  Other SASL mechanisms may be supported.  A site

    MAY disable CRAM-MD5 support if it uses more secure methods.  The

    EXTERNAL mechanism [SASL] might be useful in some cases, for

    example, if the provider has already authenticated the client, such

    as during a PPP connection.





3.1.3.  QUIT



    The QUIT command is the same as in [SMTP].





3.2.  Authenticated State



    The authenticated state is entered after a successful AUTH command.

    Two commands are valid in the authenticated state:  ATRN and QUIT.





3.2.1.  ATRN (Authenticated TURN)



    Unlike the TURN command in [SMTP], the ATRN command optionally takes

    one or more domains as a parameter.  The ATRN command MUST be

    rejected if the session has not been authenticated.  Response code

    505 should be used for this.



    The timeout for this command MUST be at least 10 minutes to allow

    the provider time to process its mail queue.



    An ATRN command sent with no domains is equivalent to an ATRN

    command specifying all domains to which the customer has access.



    If the authentication used by the customer does not provide access

    to all of the domains specified in ATRN, the provider MUST NOT send

    mail for those domains to the customer; the provider MUST reject the

    ATRN command with a 450 code.



    If the customer does have access to all of the specified domains,

    but none of them have any queued mail, the provider normally rejects

    the ATRN command with response code 453.  The provider MAY use

    response code 450, to avoid disclosing information to unauthorized

    parties regarding the domains for which it provides ODMR service.

    Or, the provider MAY issue a 250 success code, and after the roles

    are reversed, send a QUIT following the EHLO.



    The provider MAY also reject the ATRN command with a 450 response to

    indicate refusal to accept multiple requests issued within a

    particular time interval.



    If the customer has access to all of the specified domains and mail

    exists in at least one of them, the provider issues a 250 success

    code.

Internet Draft              On-Demand Mail Relay              June 1998







    If the server is unable to verify access to the requested domains

    (for example, a mapping database is temporarily unavailable),

    response code 451 is sent.



    [ABNF] for ATRN:



    atrn          = "ATRN" [domain *("," domain)]



    domain        = sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain)



    sub-domain    = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *(ldh-str)



    ldh-str       = *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-") (ALPHA / DIGIT)





3.3.  Reversed State



    After the provider has sent a success reply to the ATRN command, the

    roles reverse, and the customer becomes the server, and the provider

    becomes the client.  At this point normal [ESMTP] commands are used.

    Typically the provider sends EHLO immediately following the success

    response to ATRN, to be followed by MAIL FROM and so on.





3.4.  Other Commands



    The provider MAY reject all commands other than EHLO, AUTH, ATRN,

    and QUIT with response code 502.





4.  Example On-Demand Mail Relay Session:

      P:  220 ISP.NET on-demand mail relay server ready

      C:  EHLO foobar.net

      P:  250-AUTH CRAM-MD5 Kerberos-v5

      P:  250 ATRN

      C:  AUTH CRAM-MD5

      P:  334 MTg5Ni42OTcxNzA5NTJASVNQLkNPTQo=

      C:  Zm9vYmFyLm5ldCBiOTEzYTYwMmM3ZWRhN2E0OTViNGU2ZTczMzRkMzg5MAo=

      P:  235 now authenticated as foobar.net

      C:  ATRN foobar.net, vanity.com

      P:  250 OK now reversing the connection

      P:  EHLO ISP.NET

      C:  250 SIZE

      P:  MAIL FROM: <Lester.Tester@dot.foo.org>

      C:  250 OK

      P:  RCPT TO: <l.eva.msg@vanity.com>

      C:  250 OK, recipient accepted

      ...

      P:  QUIT

      C:  221 foobar.net closing connection

5.  Response Codes



    The response codes used in this document are:



    250  Requested mail action okay, completed

    450  ATRN request refused

    451  Unable to process ATRN request now

    453  You have no mail

    502  Command not implemented

    505  Authentication required





6.  Security Considerations



    Because access to the On-Demand Mail Relay server is only useful

    with a prior arrangement between the parties (so the provider is the

    target of MX records for the customer's domains and thus has mail to

    relay), it may be useful for the provider to restrict access to the

    On-Demand Mail Relay port.  For example, a TCP wrapper or firewall

    could be used to block access to port 366 except within the

    provider's network.  This might be useful when the provider is the

    customer's ISP.  Use of such mechanisms does not reduce the need for

    the AUTH command, however, but can increase the security it

    provides.



    Use of SASL in the AUTH command allows for substitution of more

    secure authentication mechanisms in the future.



    See sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.1 for additional security details.
