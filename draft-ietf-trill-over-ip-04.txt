      Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) over IP
                   <draft-ietf-trill-over-ip-04.txt>



Abstract
   The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol
   supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed
   so that a variety of link protocols can be used between TRILL switch
   ports. This document standardizes methods for encapsulating TRILL in
   IP (v4 or v6) so as to use IP as a TRILL link protocol in a unified
   TRILL campus. It updates RFC 7177 and RFC 7178.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


1. Introduction

   TRILL switches (RBridges) are devices that implement the IETF TRILL
   protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7177] [rfc7180bis].  TRILL provides
   transparent forwarding of frames within an arbitrary network
   topology, using least cost paths for unicast traffic. It supports
   VLANs and Fine Grained Labels [RFC7172] as well as multipathing of
   unicast and multi-destination traffic. It uses IS-IS [RFC7176] link
   state routing and encapsulation with a hop count.

   RBridges ports can communicate with each other over various link
   types, such as Ethernet [RFC6325], pseudowires [RFC7173], or PPP
   [RFC6361].

   This document defines a method for RBridge ports to communicate over
   IP (v4 or v6). TRILL over IP allows Internet-connected RBridges to
   form a single TRILL campus, or multiple TRILL over IP networks within
   a campus to be connected as a single TRILL campus via a TRILL over IP
   backbone.

   TRILL over IP connects RBridge ports using IPv4 or IPv6 as a
   transport in such a way that the ports appear to TRILL to be
   connected by a single multi-access link. If more than two RBridge
   ports are connected via a single TRILL over IP link, any pair of them
   can communicate.

   To support the scenarios where RBridges are connected via IP paths
   (such as over the public Internet) that are not under the same
   administrative control as the TRILL campus and/or not physically
   secure, this document specifies the use of IPsec [RFC4301]
   Encapsulating Security Protocol [RFC4303] to secure all or part of
   such paths.

   To dynamically select a TRILL over IP encapsulation with good fast
   path hardware support, a method is provided for agreement between
   adjacent TRILL switch ports as to what encapsulation to use.  This
   document updates [RFC7177] and [RFC7178] as described in Section 7 by
   making adjacency between TRILL over IP ports dependent on having a
   method of encapsulation in common and by redefining an interval of
   RBridge Channel protocol numbers to indicate encapsulation method
   support for TRILL over IP.

3. Use Cases for TRILL over IP

   This section introduces two application scenarios (a remote office
   scenario and an IP backbone scenario) which cover typical situations
   where network administrators may choose to use TRILL over an IP
   network to connect TRILL switches.



3.1 Remote Office Scenario

   In the Remote Office Scenario, a remote TRILL network is connected to
   a TRILL campus across a multihop IP network, such as the public
   Internet. The TRILL network in the remote office becomes a part of
   TRILL campus, and nodes in the remote office can be attached to the
   same VLANs or Fine Grained Labels [RFC7172] as local campus nodes. In
   many cases, a remote office may be attached to the TRILL campus by a
   single pair of RBridges, one on the campus end, and the other in the
   remote office. In this use case, the TRILL over IP link will often
   cross logical and physical IP networks that do not support TRILL, and
   are not under the same administrative control as the TRILL campus.



3.2 IP Backbone Scenario

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, TRILL over IP is used to connect a
   number of TRILL networks to form a single TRILL campus. For example,
   a TRILL over IP backbone could be used to connect multiple TRILL
   networks on different floors of a large building, or to connect TRILL
   networks in separate buildings of a multi-building site. In this use
   case, there may often be several TRILL switches on a single TRILL
   over IP link, and the IP link(s) used by TRILL over IP are typically
   under the same administrative control as the rest of the TRILL
   campus.



3.3 Important Properties of the Scenarios

   There are a number of differences between the above two application
   scenarios, some of which drive features of this specification. These
   differences are especially pertinent to the security requirements of
   the solution, how multicast data frames are handled, and how the
   TRILL switch ports discover each other.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


3.3.1 Security Requirements

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, TRILL over IP is used between a number
   of RBridge ports, on a network link that is in the same
   administrative control as the remainder of the TRILL campus. While it
   is desirable in this scenario to prevent the association of
   unauthorized RBridges, this can be accomplished using existing IS-IS
   security mechanisms. There may be no need to protect the data
   traffic, beyond any protections that are already in place on the
   local network.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, TRILL over IP may run over a network
   that is not under the same administrative control as the TRILL
   network. Nodes on the network may think that they are sending traffic
   locally, while that traffic is actually being sent, in an IP tunnel,
   over the public Internet. It is necessary in this scenario to protect
   the integrity and confidentiality of user traffic, as well as
   ensuring that no unauthorized RBridges can gain access to the RBridge
   campus. The issues of protecting integrity and confidentiality of
   user traffic are addressed by using IPsec for both TRILL IS-IS and
   TRILL Data packets between RBridges in this scenario.



3.3.2 Multicast Handling

   In the IP Backbone scenario, native IP multicast may be supported on
   the TRILL over IP link. If so, it can be used to send TRILL IS-IS and
   multicast data packets, as discussed later in this document.
   Alternatively, multi-destination packets can be transmitted serially
   by IP unicast to the intended recipients.

   In the Remote Office Scenario there will often be only one pair of
   RBridges connecting a given site and, even when multiple RBridges are
   used to connect a Remote Office to the TRILL campus, the intervening
   network may not provide reliable (or any) multicast connectivity.
   Issues such as complex key management also make it difficult to
   provide strong data integrity and confidentiality protections for
   multicast traffic. For all of these reasons, the connections between
   local and remote RBridges will commonly be treated like point-to-
   point links, and all TRILL IS-IS control messages and multicast data
   packets that are transmitted between the Remote Office and the TRILL
   campus will be serially transmitted by IP unicast, as discussed later
   in this document.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


3.3.3 RBridge Neighbor Discovery

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, RBridges that use TRILL over IP can use
   the normal TRILL IS-IS Hello mechanisms to discover the existence of
   other RBridges on the link [RFC7177], and to establish authenticated
   communication with those RBridges.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, an IPsec session will need to be
   established before TRILL IS-IS traffic can be exchanged, as discussed
   below. In this case, one end will need to be configured to establish
   a IPSEC session with the other. This will typically be accomplished
   by configuring the RBridge or a border device at a Remote Office to
   initiate an IPsec session and subsequent TRILL exchanges with a TRILL
   over IP-enabled RBridge attached to the TRILL campus.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


4. TRILL Packet Formats

   To support the TRILL base protocol standard [RFC6325], two types of
   packets are transmitted between RBridges: TRILL Data packets and
   TRILL IS-IS packets.

   The on-the-wire form of a TRILL Data packet in transit between two
   neighboring RBridges is as shown below:

      +--------------+----------+----------------+-----------+
      | TRILL Data   |  TRILL   |  Native Frame  |   Link    |
      | Link Header  |  Header  |     Payload    |  Trailer  |
      +--------------+----------+----------------+-----------+

   Where the encapsulated Native Frame Payload is similar to an Ethernet
   frame with a VLAN tag or Fine Grained Label [RFC7172] but with no
   trailing Frame Check Sequence (FCS).

   TRILL IS-IS packets are formatted on-the-wire as follows:

      +--------------+---------------+-----------+
      | TRILL IS-IS  |  TRILL IS-IS  |   Link    |
      | Link Header  |    Payload    |  Trailer  |
      +--------------+---------------+-----------+

   The Link Header and Link Trailer in these formats depends on the
   specific link technology. The Link Header contains one or more fields
   that distinguish TRILL Data from TRILL IS-IS. For example, over
   Ethernet, the TRILL Data Link Header ends with the TRILL Ethertype
   while the TRILL IS-IS Link Header ends with the L2-IS-IS Ethertype;
   on the other hand, over PPP, there are no Ethertypes in the Link
   Header but PPP protocol code points are included that distinguish
   TRILL Data from TRILL IS-IS.

   In TRILL over IP, we will use an IP (v4 or v6) link header. (On the
   wire, the IP header will normally be preceeded by the lower layer
   protocol that is carrying IP, such as Ethernet.) However, there are
   multiple IP based encapsulations usable for TRILL over IP as further
   discussed in Section 7 that differ in exactly what appears after the
   IP header and before the TRILL Header or the TRILL IS-IS Payload.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


5. Some Link Protocol Specifics

   TRILL Data packets can be unicast to a specific RBridge or multicast
   to all RBridges on a link. TRILL IS-IS packets are always multicast
   to all other RBridge on the link except for IS-IS MTU PDUs, which may
   be unicast [RFC7177]. On TRILL over Ethernet links, the Ethernet
   multicast addresses All-RBridges and All-IS-IS-RBridges are used for
   multicasting TRILL Data and TRILL IS-IS respectively.

   To properly handle TRILL protocol packets on a TRILL over IP link in
   the general case, either native IP multicast mode must be used on
   that link, or multicast must be simulated using serial IP unicast, as
   discussed in Section 8. (Of course, if the IP link happens to
   actually be point-to-point no special provision is needed for
   handling multicast addressed packets.)

   In TRILL Hello PDUs used on TRILL IP links, the IP addresses of the
   connected IP ports are their actual SNPA (SubNetwork Point of
   Attachment [IS-IS]) addresses and, for IPv6, the 16-byte IPv6 address
   is used as the SNPA; however, for easy in re-using code designed for
   common 48-bit IS-IS SNPAs in TRILL over IPv4, a 48-bit synthetic SNPA
   that looks like a unicast MAC address is constructed for use in the
   SNPA field of TRILL Neighbor TLVs [RFC7176] [RFC7177] on such TRILL
   over IPv4 links. This synthetic SNPA is derived from the port IPv4
   address is as follows:

                           1 1 1 1 1 1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  0xFE         |  0x00         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  IPv4 upper half              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  IPv4 lower half              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This synthetic SNPA (MAC) address has the local (0x02) bit on in the
   first byte and so cannot conflict with any globally unique 48-bit
   Ethernet MAC. However, when TRILL operates on an IP link, TRILL sees
   only IP stations, not MAC stations, even if the TRILL over IP Link is
   being carried over Ethernet. Therefore conflict on the link in TRILL
   IS-IS between a real MAC address and the synethic SNPA (MAC) address
   as above would be impossible in any case.

6. TRILL over IP Port Configuration

   This section specifies the configuration information needed at a
   TRILL over IP port beyond that needed for a general RBridge port.



6.1 Per IP Port Configuration

   Each RBridge port used for a TRILL over IP link should have at least
   one IP (v4 or v6) address. If no IP address is associated with the
   port, perhaps as a transient condition during re-configuration, the
   port is disabled. Implementations MAY allow a single port to operate
   as multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 logical ports. Each IP address
   constitutes a different logical port and the RBridge with those ports
   MUST associate a different Port ID (see Section 4.4.2 of [RFC6325])
   with each logical port.

   By default a TRILL over IP port discards output packets that fail the
   possible recursive ingress test (see Section 10.1) unless configured
   to disable that test.



6.2 Additional per IP Address Cofiguration

   The configuration information specified below is per TRILL over IP
   port IP address.

   The mapping from TRILL packet priority to Differentiated Services
   Code Point (DSCP [RFC2474]) can be configured (see Section 10.5).

   Each TRILL over IP port has a list of acceptable encapsulations it
   will use. By default this list consists of one entry for native
   encapsulation (see Section 7). Additional encapsulations MAY be
   configured. Additional configuration can be required or possible for
   specific encapsulations as described in Section 6.2.3.

   Each IP address at a TRILL over IP port uses native IP multicast by
   default but may be configured whether to use serial IP unicast
   (Section 6.2.2) or native IP multicast (Section 6.2.1). Each IP
   address at a TRILL over IP is configured whether or not to use IPsec
   (Section 6.2.4).



6.2.1 Native Multicast Configuration

   If a TRILL over IP port address is using native IP multicast for
   multi-destination TRILL packets (IS-IS and data), by default


Margaret Cullen, et al                                         [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


   transmissions from that IP address use the IP multicast address (IPv4
   or IPv6) specified in Section 13.2. The TRILL over IP port may be
   configured to use a different IP address to multicast packets.



6.2.2 Serial Unicast Configuration

   If a TRILL over IP port address has been configured to use serial
   unicast for multi-destination packets (IS-IS and data), it should
   have associated with it a non-empty list of unicast IP destination
   addresses with the same IP version as the version of the port's IP
   address (IPv4 or IPv6). Multi-destination TRILL packets are serially
   unicast to the addresses in this list. Such a TRILL over IP port will
   only be able to form adjacencies [RFC7177] with the RBridges at the
   addresses in this list as those are the only RBridges to which it
   will send TRILL Hellos.

   If this list of destination IP addresses is empty, there is no way to
   transmit a multi-destination TRILL over IP packet such as a TRILL
   Hello. Thus it is impossible to achieve adjacency [RFC7177] or if
   adjacency had been achieved (perhaps the list was non-empty and has
   just been configured to be empty), no way to maintain such adjacency.
   Thus, in the empty list case, TRILL Data multi-destination packets
   cannot be sent and TRILL Data unicast packets will not start flowing
   or, if they are already flowing, will soon cease, effectively
   disabling the port.



6.2.3 Encapsulation Specific Configuration

   Specific TRILL over IP encapsulation methods may provide for futher
   configuration as specified below.



6.2.3.1 VXLAN Configuration

   A TRILL over IP port using VXLAN encapsulation can be configured with
   a non-default VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) which is used in that
   field of the VXLAN header for all TRILL packets sent using the
   encapsulation and required in all TRILL packets received using the
   encapsulation. The default VNI is 1. A TRILL packet received with the
   wrong VNI is discarded.

   A TRILL over IP port using VXLAN encapsulation can also be configured
   to map the Inner.VLAN or Inner.FGL of a TRILL Data packet being
   transported to the value it places in the VNI field.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


6.2.3.2 Other Encapsulation Configuration

   Additional encapsulation methods, beyond the native UDP encapsulation
   and VXLAN encapsulation specified in this document, may be specified
   in future documents and may require further configuration.

7. TRILL over IP Encapsulation Formats

   There are a variety of TRILL over IP encapsulation formats possible.
   In all cases, there must be a method specified to distinguish TRILL
   Data and TRILL IS-IS packets, or that encapsulation is not useful for
   TRILL. The following criteria can be helpful is choosing between
   different encapsulations:

   a) Fast path support - For most applications, it is highly desireable
      to be able to encapsulate/decpasulate TRILL over IP at line speed
      so a format where existing or anticipated fast path hardware can
      do that is best.

   b) Ease of multi-pathing - The IP path between TRILL over IP ports
      may include internal equal cost multipath routes so a method of
      encapsulation that provides variable fields available for existing
      or anticipated fast path hardware multi-pathing is better.

   c) Fragmentaton and robust ID support - tbd

   d) Checksum strength - Depending on the particular circumstances of
      the TRILL over IP link, a checksum provided by the encapsulation
      may be an important factor. Use of IPsec as provided herein can
      also provide a strong integrity check.

   TRILL over IP adopts a hybrid encapsulation approach by default.

   There is one format, called "native encapsulation" that MUST be
   implemented. Although native encapsulation does not typically have
   good fast path support, as a lowest common denominator it can be used
   with low bandwidth control messages to detetmine a preferred
   encapsulation with better performance. In particular, by default all
   TRILL IS-IS Hellos are sent using native encapsulation and those
   Hellos are used to determine the encpasulation used for all TRILL
   Data packets and all other TRILL IS-IS PDUs (with the possible
   exception of IS-IS MTU-probe and MTU-ack PDUs).

   Alternatively, the network operator can pre-configure a TRILL over IP
   port to use a particular encapsulation choosen for their particular
   network needs and TRILL over IP port capabiliies. That encapsulation
   is then used for all TRILL data and IS-IS packets.

   Section 7.1 discusses encapsulation agreement. Section 7.2 discusses
   TRILL over IP IPsec ESP format, which is independent of
   encapsulation. Section 7.3 discusses broadcast link encapsulation
   considerations. The subsequent subsections discuss particular
   encapsulations.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


7.1 Encapsulation Agreement

   TRILL Hellos sent out a TRILL over IP port indicate the
   encapsulations that port is willing to use through a mechanism
   described in [RFC7178] and [RFC7176] that is hereby extended.
   Specifically, RBridge Channel Protocol numbers 0xFD0 through 0xFF7
   are redefined to be link technology dependent flags that, for TRILL
   over IP, indicate support for different encapsulations, allowing for
   up to 40 encapsulations to be specified.  Support for an
   encapsulation is indicated in the Hello PDU in the same way that
   support for an RBridge Channel was indicated. (See also section
   13.3.) "Support" indicates willingness to use that encapsulation for
   TRILL data and TRILL IS-IS (although Hellos are still sent in native
   encapsulation by default).

   If, in a TRILL Hello on a TRILL over IP link, support is not
   indicated for any encapsulation, then the port from which it was sent
   is assumed to support only native encapsualtion (see Section 7.4).

   An adjacency is formed between two TRILL over IP ports ONLY if the
   intersection of the sets of encapsulation methods they support is not
   null. If that intersection is null, then no adjaceny is formed. In
   particular, for a TRILL over IP link, the adjacency state machine
   MUST NOT advance to the Report state unless the ports share an
   encapsulation [RFC7177]. If no encapsulation is shared, the adjacency
   state machine remains in the state from which it would otherwise have
   transistioned to the Report state.

   If any TRILL over IP packet, other than an IS-IS Hello or MTU PDU in
   native encapsulation, is received in an encapsulation for which
   support is not being indicated, it MUST be discarded (see Section
   7.3).

   It is expected to be the normal case in a well configured network
   that all the TRILL over IP ports connected to an IP link (i.e., an IP
   network) that are intended to communicate with each other will
   support the same encapsulation.



7.2 IPsec ESP Format

   TRILL over IP link security uses IPsec Encapsulating Security
   Protocol (ESP) in tunnel mode [RFC4303]. Since TRILL over IP always
   starts with an IP Header (on the wire this appears right after any
   required Layer 2 header), the modifications for IPsec are independent
   of the TRILL over IP encapsulation fields that occur after that IP
   Header and before the TRILL Header. The resulting packet formats are
   as follows for IPv4 and IPv6:



Margaret Cullen, et al                                         [Page 15]

                        |<----------- integrity ---------->|

   The "TRILL Encap2" above includes whatever additional fields are
   required by the encapsulation in use, followed by the TRILL Header,
   and then the native frame payload (see Section 4).

   This architecture permits the ESP tunnel end point to be separated
   from the TRILL over IP RBridge port (see, for example, Section 1.1.3
   of [RFC7296]).



7.3 Broadcast Link Encapsulation Considerations

   It is possible for the Hellos from a TRILL over IP port P1 to
   establish adjacency with multiple other TRILL over IP ports (P2, P3,
   ...) forming a broadcast link. In a well configured network one would
   expect all of the IP ports involved to support the same
   encapsulation; but, if P1 supports multiple encapsulations, it is
   possible that P2 and P3, for example, do not have an encapsulation in
   common that is supported by P1. IS-IS can handle such non-transitive
   adjacencies which are reported as specified in [RFC7177]. If serial
   IP unicast is being used by P1, it can use different encapsulatons
   for different transmission.  If native IP multicast is being used by
   P1, it will have to send one transmission per encapsulation method by
   which it has an adjanceny on the link. (It is for this reason that a
   TRILL over IP port MUST discard any packet received with the wrong
   encapsulation. Otherwise, packets would be duplicated.)



7.4 Native Encapsulaton

   The mandatory to implement "native encapsulaton" format of a TRILL
   over IP packet, when used without security, is TRILL over UDP as
   shown below.


Margaret Cullen, et al                                         [Page 16]

      |  TRILL Payload ...

      Source Port - see Section 10.2

      Destination Port - indicates TRILL Data or IS-IS, see Section 13

      UDP Length - as specified in [RFC0768]

      UDP Checksum - as specified in [RFC0768]

   The TRILL Payload starts with the TRILL Header (not including the
   TRILL Ethertype) for TRILL Data packets and starts with the 0x83
   Intradomain Routeing Protocol Discriminator byte (thus not including
   the L2-IS-IS Ethertype) for TRILL IS-IS packets.



7.5 VXLAN Encapsulation

   VXLAN [RFC7348] IP encapsulation of TRILL looks, on the wire, like
   TRILL over Ethernet over VXLAN over UDP over IP.

            +--------+--------+--------+----------+-----------+
            | IP     | UDP    | VXLAN  | Ethernet | TRILL     |
            | Header | Header | Header | Header   | Payload   |
            +--------+--------+--------+----------+-----------+

   The outer UDP uses a destination port number indicating VXLAN and the
   outer UDP source port may be used for entropy as with native
   encapsulation (see Section 7.4). The VXLAN header after the outer UDP
   header adds a 24 bit Virtual Network Identifier (VNI). The Ethernet
   header after the VXLAN header and before the TRILL header consists of
   source MAC address, destination MAC address, and Ethertype. The
   Ethertype distinguishes TRILL data from TRILL IS-IS; however, the
   destination and source MAC addresses in this inner Ethernet header
   are not used and are 12 wasted bytes.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


   A TRILL over IP port using VXLAN encapsulation by default uses a VNI
   of 1 but can be configured as described in Section 6.2.3.1 to use
   some other fixed VNI or to map from VLAN/FGL to VNI.



7.6 Other Encpaulsations

   It is aniticpated that additional TRILL over IP encapsulations will
   be specified in future documents and allocated a bit in the TRILL
   Hello as per Section 13.3. A primary consideration for whether to
   specify an encapsulation is fast path support.

8. Handling Multicast

   By default, both TRILL IS-IS packets and multi-destination TRILL Data
   packets are sent to an All-RBridges IPv4 or IPv6 IP multicast Address
   as appropriate (see Section 13.2); however, a TRILL over IP port may
   be configured (see Section 6) to use a different multicast address or
   to use serial IP unicast with a list of one or more unicast IP
   addresses of other TRILL over IP ports to which multi-destination
   packets are sent. In the serial unicast case the outer IP header
   shows the IP unicast even through the TRILL header has the M bit set
   to one to indicate multi-destination. Serial unicast configuration is
   necessary if the TRILL over IP port is connected to an IP network
   that does not support IP multicast. In any case, unicast TRILL
   packets are sent by unicast IP.

   When a TRILL over IP port is using IP multicast, it MUST periodically
   transmit appropriate IGMP (IPv4 [RFC3376] or MLD (IPv6 [RFC2710])
   packets so that the TRILL multicast IP traffic will be sent to it.

   Although TRILL fully supports broadcast links with more than 2
   RBridges connected to the link there may be good reasons for
   configuring TRILL over IP ports to use serial unicast even where
   native IP multicast is available. Use of serial unicast provides the
   network manager with more precise control over adjacencies and how
   TRILL over IP links will be formed in an IP network. In some
   networks, unicast is more reliable than multicast. If multiple point-
   to-point TRILL over IP connections between parts of a TRILL campus
   are configured, TRILL will in any case spread traffic across them,
   treating them as parallel links, and appropriately fail over traffic
   if a link fails or incorporate a new link that comes up.

9. Use of IPsec

   All RBridges that support TRILL over IP MUST implement IPsec
   [RFC4301] and support the use of IPsec Encapsulating Security
   Protocol (ESP [RFC4303]) in tunnel mode to secure both TRILL IS-IS
   and TRILL data packets. When IPsec is used to secure a TRILL over IP
   link and no IS-IS security is enabled, the IPsec session MUST be
   fully established before any TRILL IS-IS or data packets are
   exchanged. When there is IS-IS security [RFC5310] provided,
   implementors SHOULD use IS-IS security to protect TRILL IS-IS
   packets. However, in this case, the IPsec session still MUST be fully
   established before any data packets transmission since IS-IS security
   does not provide any protection to data packets.



9.1 Keying

   The following subsections discuss pairwise and group keying for TRILL
   over IP IPsec.



9.1.1 Pairwise Keying

   The default pairwise derived key for IPsec usage between TRILL over
   IP ports P1 and P2 is determined as follows:

      HKDF-Expand-SHA256 ( IS-IS-key,
         "TRILL IP" | P1-System-ID | P1-Port | P2-System-ID | P2-Port )

   In the above "|" indicates concatenation, HKDF is as in [RFC5869],
   SHA256 is as in [RFC6234], and "TRILL IP" is the eight byte US ASCII
   [RFC0020] string indicated. "IS-IS-key" is an IS-IS key usable for
   IS-IS security of link local IS-IS PDUs such as Hello, CSNP, and
   PSNP. This SHOULD be a link scope IS-IS key. With [RFC5310] there
   could be multiple keys identified with 16-bit key IDs. In this case,
   the Key ID of IS-IS-key is also used to identify the derived key.

   Although we are using derived keys at the IPsec level, the IS-IS-
   shared keys from which they are derived might expire and can be
   updated as described in [RFC5310].  The derived keys MUST expire
   within the lifetime as the IS-IS-shared keys from which they were
   derived.

9.1.2 Group Keying

   In the case of a TRILL over IP port configured as point-to-point (see
   Section 4.2.4.1 of [RFC6325]), there is no group keying and the
   pairwise key determined as in Section 9.1.1 is used for IP multicast
   traffic.

   In the case of a TRILL over IP port configured as broadcast but where
   the port is configured to use serial unicast (see Section 8), there
   is no group keying and the pairwise keying determined as in Section
   9.1.1 is used for IP multicast traffic.

   In the case of a TRILL over IP port configured as broadcast and using
   native mutlicast, ... tbd ...



9.2 Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms

   All RBridges that support TRILL over IP MUST implement IPsec ESP
   [RFC4303] in tunnel mode. The implementation requirements for ESP
   cryptographic algorithms are as specified for IPsec. That
   specification is currently [RFC7321].

10. Transport Considerations

   This section discusses a variety of transport considerations.



10.1 Recursive Ingress

   TRILL is specified to transport data to and from end stations over
   Ethernet and IP is frequently transported over Ethernet. Thus, an end
   station native data Ethernet frame EF might get TRILL ingressed to
   TRILL(EF) which was then sent out a TRILL over IP over Ethernet port
   resulting in a packet on the wire of the form
   Ethernet(IP(TRILL(EF))).  There is a risk of such a packet being re-
   ingressed by the same TRILL campus, due to physical or logical
   misconfiguration, looping round, being further re-ingressed, and so
   on. The packet might get discarded if it got too large but if
   fragmentation is enabled, it would just keep getting split into
   fragments that would continue to loop and grow and re-fragment until
   the path was saturated with junk and packets were being discarded due
   to queue overflow. The TRILL Header TTL would provide no protection
   because each TRILL ingress adds a new TRILL header with a new TTL.

   To protect against this scenario, a TRILL over IP port MUST by,
   default, test whether a TRILL packet it is about to transmit appears
   to be a TRILL ingress of a TRILL over IP over Ethernet packet. That
   is, is it of the form TRILL(Ethernet(IP(TRILL(...)))? If so, the
   default action of the TRILL over IP output port is to discard the
   packet rather than transmit it. However, there are cases where some
   level of nested ingress is desired so it MUST be possible to
   configure the port to allow such packets.



10.2 Fat Flows

   For the purpose of load balancing, it is worthwhile to consider how
   to transport the TRILL packets over the Equal Cost Multiple Paths
   (ECMPs) existing internal to the IP path between TRILL over IP ports.

   The ECMP election for the IP traffic could be based, at least for
   IPv4, on the quintuple of the outer IP header { Source IP,
   Destination IP, Source Port, Destination Port, and IP protocol }.
   Such tuples, however, could be exactly the same for all TRILL Data
   packets between two RBridge ports, even if there is a huge amount of
   data being sent between a variety of ingress and egress RBridges.
   Therefore, in order to better support ECMP, a RBridge SHOULD set the
   Source Port as an entropy field for ECMP decisions. (This idea is
   also introduced in [gre-in-udp].) For example, for TRILL Data this
   entropy field could be based on some hash of the Inner.MacDA,


Margaret Cullen, et al                                         [Page 22]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


   Inner.MacSA, and Inner.VLAN or Inner.FGL.



10.3 Congestion Considerations

   Section 3.1.3 of [RFC5405] discussed the congestion implications of
   UDP tunnels. As discussed in [RFC5405], because other flows can share
   the path with one or more UDP tunnels, congestion control [RFC2914]
   needs to be considered.

   The default initial determination of the TRILL over IP encapsulation
   to be used through the exchange of TRILL IS-IS Hellos is a low
   bandwidth process. Hellos are not permitted to be sent any more often
   than once per second, and so are unlikely to cause congestion.

   One motivation for including UDP in a TRILL encapsulation is to
   improve the use of multipath (such as ECMP) in cases where traffic is
   to traverse routers which are able to hash on UDP Port and IP
   address. In many cases this may reduce the occurrence of congestion
   and improve usage of available network capacity. However, it is also
   necessary to ensure that the network, including applications that use
   the network, responds appropriately in more difficult cases, such as
   when link or equipment failures have reduced the available capacity.

   The impact of congestion must be considered both in terms of the
   effect on the rest of the network of a UDP tunnel that is consuming
   excessive capacity, and in terms of the effect on the flows using the
   UDP tunnels. The potential impact of congestion from a UDP tunnel
   depends upon what sort of traffic is carried over the tunnel, as well
   as the path of the tunnel.

   TRILL is used to carry a wide range of traffic. In many cases TRILL
   is used to carry IP traffic. IP traffic is generally assumed to be
   congestion controlled, and thus a tunnel carrying general IP traffic
   (as might be expected to be carried across the Internet) generally
   does not need additional congestion control mechanisms. As specified
   in [RFC5405]:

   "IP-based traffic is generally assumed to be congestion-controlled,
   i.e., it is assumed that the transport protocols generating IP-based
   traffic at the sender already employ mechanisms that are sufficient
   to address congestion on the path. Consequently, a tunnel carrying
   IP-based traffic should already interact appropriately with other
   traffic sharing the path, and specific congestion control mechanisms
   for the tunnel are not necessary".

   For this reason, where TRILL is sent using UDP and used to carry IP
   traffic that is known to be congestion controlled, the UDP paths MAY
   be used across any combination of a single or cooperating service


Margaret Cullen, et al                                         [Page 23]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


   providers or across the general Internet.

   However, TRILL is also used to carry traffic that is not necessarily
   congestion controlled. For example, TRILL may be used to carry
   traffic where specific bandwidth guarantees are provided.

   In such cases congestion may be avoided by careful provisioning of
   the network and/or by rate limiting of user data traffic. Where TRILL
   is carried, directly or indirectly, over UDP over IP, the identity of
   each individual TRILL flow is in general lost.

   For this reason, where the TRILL traffic is not congestion
   controlled, TRILL over UDP/IP MUST only be used within a single
   service provider that utilizes careful provisioning (e.g., rate
   limiting at the entries of the network while over-provisioning
   network capacity) to ensure against congestion, or within a limited
   number of service providers who closely cooperate in order to jointly
   provide this same careful provisioning. As such, TRILL over UDP/IP
   MUST NOT be used over the general Internet, or over non-cooperating
   service providers, to carry traffic that is not congestion-
   controlled.

   Measures SHOULD be taken to prevent non-congestion-controlled TRILL
   over UDP/IP traffic from "escaping" to the general Internet, for
   example the following:

   a. Physical or logical isolation of the TRILL over IP links from the
      general Internet.

   b. Deployment of packet filters that block the UDP ports assigned for
      TRILL-over-UDP.

   c. Imposition of restrictions on TRILL over UDP/IP traffic by
      software tools used to set up TRILL over UDP paths between
      specific end systems (as might be used within a single data
      center).

   d. Use of a "Managed Circuit Breaker" for the TRILL traffic as
      described in [circuit-breaker].



10.4 MTU Considerations

   In TRILL each RBridge advertises in its LSP number zero the largest
   LSP frame it can accept (but not less than 1,470 bytes) on any of its
   interfaces (at least those interfaces with adjacencies to other
   RBridges in the campus) through the originatingLSPBufferSize TLV
   [RFC6325] [RFC7177]. The campus minimum MTU (Maximum Transmission
   Unit), denoted Sz, is then established by taking the minimum of this


Margaret Cullen, et al                                         [Page 24]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


   advertised MTU for all RBridges in the campus. Links that do not meet
   the Sz MTU are not included in the routing topology. This protects
   the operation of IS-IS from links that would be unable to accommodate
   some LSPs.

   A method of determining originatingLSPBufferSize for an RBridge with
   one or more TRILL over IP ports is described in [rfc7180bis].
   However, if an IP link either can accommodate jumbo frames or is a
   link on which IP fragmentation is enabled and acceptable, then it is
   unlikely that the IP link will be a constraint on the
   originatingLSPBufferSize of an RBridge using the link. On the other
   hand, if the IP link can only handle smaller frames and fragmentation
   is to be avoided when possible, a TRILL over IP port might constrain
   the RBridge's originatingLSPBufferSize. Because TRILL sets the
   minimum values of Sz at 1,470 bytes, there may be links that meet the
   minimum MTU for the IP protocol (1,280 bytes for IPv6, 576 bytes for
   IPv4) on which it would be necessary to enable fragmentation for
   TRILL use.

   The optional use of TRILL IS-IS MTU PDUs, as specified in [RFC6325]
   and [RFC7177] can provide added assurance of the actual MTU of a
   link.



10.5 QoS Considerations

   Within TRILL, priority is indicated by a three bit (0 through 7)
   priority field in TRILL data packets and by configuration for TRILL
   IS-IS packets.  When TRILL packets are sent on a TRILL over IP link,
   this priority is mapped to a Differential Services Code Point (DSCP
   [RFC2474] Section 4.2.2).

   The default mapping, which may be configured per TRILL over IP port,
   is an follows. Note that, to provide a potentially lower priority
   service than the default 0, priority 1 is considered lower priority
   than 0. So the priority squence from lower to higher priority is 1,
   0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

      TRILL Priority  DiffServ Field (Binary/decimal)
      --------------  -------------------------------
                  0    00100000 / 8
                  1    00000000 / 0
                  2    01000000 / 16
                  3    01100000 / 24
                  4    10000000 / 32
                  5    10100000 / 40
                  6    11000000 / 48

12. Security Considerations

   TRILL over IP is subject to all of the security considerations for
   the base TRILL protocol [RFC6325]. In addition, there are specific
   security requirements for different TRILL deployment scenarios, as
   discussed in the "Use Cases for TRILL over IP" section above.

   For communication between end stations in a TRILL campus, security is
   possible at three levels: end-to-end security between those end
   stations, edge-to-edge security between ingress and egress RBridges
   [LinkSec], and link security to protect a TRILL hop. Any combination
   of these can be used, including all three.

   TRILL over IP link security protects the contents of TRILL data and
   IS-IS packets, including the identities of the end stations for data
   and the identities of the edge RBridges, from observers of the link
   and transit devices within the link such as IP routers, but does not
   encrypt the link local IP addresses used in a packet and does not
   protect against observation by the sending and receiveing RBridges on
   the link. Edge-to-edge TRILL security protects the contents of TRILL
   data packets including the identities of the end stations for data
   from transit RBridges but does not encrypt the identities of the edge
   RBridges involved and does not protect against observation by those
   edge RBridges. End-to-end security does not protect the identities of
   the end stations or edge RBridge involved but does protect the
   content of TRILL data packets from observation by all RBridges or
   other intervening devices between the end stations involved.  End-to-
   end security should always be considered as an added layer of
   security and to protect any particularly sensitive information from
   unintended disclosure.



12.1 IPsec

   This document specifies that all RBridges that support TRILL over IP
   links MUST implement IPsec for the security of such links, and makes
   it clear that it is both wise and good to use IPsec in all cases
   where a TRILL over IP link will traverse a network that is not under
   the same administrative control as the rest of the TRILL campus or is
   not physically secure. IPsec is important, in these cases, to protect
   the privacy and integrity of data traffic. However, in cases where
   IPsec is impractical due to lack of fast path support, use of TRILL
   edge-to-edge security or use by the end stations of end-to-end
   security can provide significant security.

   Further Secuity Considerations for IPsec ESP and for the
   cryptographic algorithms used with IPsec can be found in the RFCs
   referenced by this document.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             TRILL over IP


12.2 IS-IS Security

   TRILL over IP is compatible with the use of IS-IS Security [RFC5310],
   which can be used to authenticate RBridges before allowing them to
   join a TRILL campus. This is sufficient to protect against rogue
   devices impersonating RBridges, but is not sufficient to protect data
   packets that may be sent in TRILL over IP outside of the local
   network or across the public Internet. To protect the privacy and
   integrity of that traffic, use IPsec.

   In cases were IPsec is used, the use of IS-IS security may not be
   necessary, but there is nothing about this specification that would
   prevent using both IPsec and IS-IS security together.

13. IANA Considerations

   IANA considerations are given below.



13.1 Port Assignments

   IANA has allocated the following destination UDP Ports for the TRILL
   IS-IS and Data channels:

          UDP Port           Protocol
         ----------         ---------------------
          (TBD1)             TRILL IS-IS Channel
          (TBD2)             TRILL Data Channel



13.2 Multicast Address Assignments

   IANA has allocated one IPv4 and one IPv6 multicast address, as shown
   below, which correspond to the All-RBridges and All-IS-IS-RBridges
   multicast MAC addresses that the IEEE Registration Authority has
   assigned for TRILL. Because the low level hardware MAC address
   dispatch considerations for TRILL over Ethernet do not apply to TRILL
   over IP, one IP multicast address for each version of IP is
   sufficient.

   (Values recommended to IANA in square brackets)

      Name              IPv4                  IPv6
   ------------      ------------------   --------------------------
   All-RBridges      TBD3[233.252.14.0]   TBD4[FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:205]

   Note: when these IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses are used and the
   resulting IP frame is sent over Ethernet, the usual IP derived MAC
   address is used.

   [Need to discuss scopes for IPv6 multicast (the "X" in the addresses)
   somewhere. Default to "site" scope but MUST be configurable?]



13.3 Encapsulation Method Support Indication

   The existing "RBridge Channel Protocols" registry is re-named and a
   new sub-registry under that registry added as follows:

   The TRILL Parameters registry for "RBridge Channel Protocols" is
   renamed the "RBridge Channel Protocols and Link Technology Specific

   Flags" registry. [this document] is added as a second reference for
   this registry. The first part of the table is changed to the
   following:

         Range      Registration        Note

                                       see subregistry

   In the existing table of RBridge Channel Protocols, the following
   line is changed to two lines as shown:

      OLD
        0x004-0xFF7   Unassigned
      NEW
        0x004-0xFCF   Unassigned
        0xFD0-0xFF7   (link technology dependent, see subregistry)

   A new subregistry under the re-named "RBridge Channel Protocols and
   Link Technology Specific Flags" registry is added as follows:

      Name: TRILL over IP Link Flags
      Registration Procedure: IETF Review
      Reference: [this document]
