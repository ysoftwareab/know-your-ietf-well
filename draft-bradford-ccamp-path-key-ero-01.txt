   Abstract 
    
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
   Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be 
   computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP 
   crosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous Systems (ASes), the 
   path may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with each 
   responsible for computing a segment of the path. To preserve 
   confidentiality of topology with each AS, the PCE supports a 
   mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of a path, called the 
   Confidential Path Segment (CPS), by encoding the contents as a 
   Path Key Subobject (PKS). This document describes the addition of 
   this information to Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling 
   by inclusion in the Explicit Route Object (ERO) and Record Route 
   Object (RRO).

1.  Introduction 
    
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
   Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are signaled 
   using the TE extensions to the Resource Reservation Protocol 
   (RSVP-TE) [RFC3209], [RFC3473]. The routes followed by MPLS and 
   GMPLS TE LSPs may be computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs) 
   [RFC4655].  
    
   Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous 
   Systems (ASes), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that 
   cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment of the 
   path. To preserve confidentiality of topology with each AS, the 
   PCE Communications Protocol (PCEP) [PCEP] supports a mechanism to 
   hide the contents of a segment of a path, called the Confidential 
   Path Segment (CPS), by encoding the contents as a Path Key 
   Subobject (PKS) [PCE-PKS]. 
    
   This document defines RSVP-TE protocol extensions necessary to 
   support the use of Path Key Segments in MPLS and GMPLS signaling.

2.  Terminology 
     
   CPS: Confidential Path Segment. A segment of a path that contains 
   nodes and links that the AS policy requires to not be disclosed 
   outside the AS. 
    
   PCE: Path Computation Element: an entity (component, application 
   or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or 
   route based on a network graph and applying computational 
   constraints. 
    
   PKS: Path Key Subobject. A subobject of an Explicit Route Object 
   which encodes a CPS, so as to preserve confidentiality. 
    
3.  RSVP-TE Path Key Subobject 
    
   The Path Key Subobject (PKS) may be carried in the Explicit Route 
   Object (ERO) of a RSVP-TE Path message [RFC3209]. The PKS is a 
   fixed-length subobject containing a Path-Key and a PCE-ID. The 
   Path Key is an identifier, or token used to represent the CPS 
   within the context of the PCE identified by the PCE-ID. The PCE-ID 
   identifies the PCE that can decode the Path Key using a reachable 
   IPv4 or IPv6 address of the PCE. In most cases, the decoding PCE 
   is also the PCE that computed the Path Key and the associated 
   path. Because of the IPv4 and IPv6 variants, two subobjects are 
   defined as follows.

         L 
    
             The L bit SHOULD NOT be set, so that the subobject 
             represents a strict hop in the explicit route. 
    
         Type 
            
             Subobject Type for a Path Key with 32-bit PCE ID as 
             assigned by IANA.

            The Length contains the total length of the subobject in 
            bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length 
            is always 8. 
           
         PCE ID 
    
            A 32-bit identifier of the PCE that can decode this key. 
            The identifier MUST be unique within the scope of the 
            domain that the CPS crosses, and MUST be understood by 
            the LSR that will act as PCC for the expansion of the 
            PKS. The interpretation of the PCE-ID is subject to 
            domain-local policy. It MAY be an IPv4 address of the PCE 
            that is always reachable, and MAY be an address that is 
            restricted to the domain in which the LSR that is called 
            upon to expand the CPS lies. Other values that have no 
            meaning outside the domain (for example, the Router ID of 
            the PCE) MAY be used to increase security or 
            confidentiality.

       Length 
    
           The Length contains the total length of the subobject in 
           bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length 
           is always 20. 
    
       PCE ID 
    
           A 128-bit identifier of the PCE that can decode this key. 
           The identifier MUST be unique within the scope of the

           domain that the CPS crosses, and MUST be understood by the 
           LSR that will act as PCC for the expansion of the PKS. The 
           interpretation of the PCE-ID is subject to domain-local 
           policy. It MAY be an IPv6 address of the PCE that is 
           always reachable, but MAY be an address that is restricted 
           to the domain in which the LSR that is called upon to 
           expand the CPS lies. Other values that have no meaning 
           outside the domain (for example, the IPv6 TE Router ID) 
           MAY be used to increase security (see Section 5). 
    
   Note: The twins of these sub-objects are carried in PCEP messages 
   as defined in [PCE-PKS]. Ideally, IANA assignment of the subobject 
   types will be identical. 
    

3.1.   Explicit Route Object Processing Rules 
    
   This section to be completed in a future release. 

3.2.   Reporting Path Key Segments in Record Route Objects 
    
   This section to be completed in a future release. 
    
4.  Security Considerations 
    
 - Confidentiality of the CPS (can other network elements probe for 
     expansion of path-keys, possibly at random?). 
  
  - Authenticity of the path-key (resilience to alteration by 
     intermediaries, resilience to fake expansion of path-keys). 
  
  - Resilience from DNS attacks (insertion of spurious path-keys; 
     flooding of bogus path-key expansion requests). 
 
   Most of the interactions required by this extension are point to 
   point, can be authenticated and made secure as described in [PCEP] 
   and [RFC3209]. These interactions are listed in [PCE-PKS] 
        
      
   Thus, the major security issues can be dealt with using standard 
   techniques for securing and authenticating point-to-point 
   communications. In addition, it is recommended that the PCE 
   providing a decode response should check that the LSR that issued 
   the decode request is the head end of the decoded ERO segment.  
    
   Further protection can be provided by using a PCE ID to identify 
   the decoding PCE that is only meaningful within the domain that 
   contains the LSR at the head of the CPS. This may be an IP address

   that is only reachable from within the domain, or some not-address 
   value. The former requires configuration of policy on the PCEs, 
   the latter requires domain-wide policy.  
    
5.  Manageability Considerations 
    

5.1.   Control of Function Through Configuration and Policy 
 
   The treatment of a path segment as a CPS, and its substitution in 
   a PCReq ERO with a PKS, is a function that SHOULD be under 
   operator and policy control where a PCE supports the function. The 
   operator SHOULD be given the ability to specify which path 
   segments are to be replaced and under what circumstances. For 
   example, an operator might set a policy that states that every 
   path segment for the operator's domain will be replaced by a PKS 
   when the PCReq has been issued from outside the domain.  
    
    
 
    
6.  IANA considerations 
    
   The IANA section will be detailed in further revision of this 
   document. 
    
   It will include code point requests for the three new ERO sub-
   objects, and a new ErrorSpec Error Code. 
    
   Note: The twins of these sub-objects are be carried in PCEP 
   messages as defined in [PCE-PKS]. Ideally, IANA assignment of the 
   subobject types will be identical.
