1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580] 
    
2. Overview 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for managing the Open Shortest Path First Routing Protocol for IPv6 
   [RFC2740], otherwise known as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3). Though the 
   fundamental mechanisms of OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) [RFC2328] remain 
   unchanged in OSPFv3, some changes were necessary due to differences 
   in IP address size and in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6. 
   In many cases, where the protocol operations have not changed from

                              OSPFv3 MIB                      May 2005 
 
 
   OSPFv2, the specification for OSPFv3 does not restate the details, 
   but instead refers to the relevant sections in the OSPFv2 
   specification. This MIB follows along the same lines and includes 
   Reference clauses referring to the OSPFv2 specification when 
   applicable. 
    
   An attempt was made to align the OSPFv3 MIB as closely as possible 
   with the OSPFv2 MIB. The following subsections highlight the major 
   differences between the OSPFv2 MIB [RFC1850] and the OSPFv3 MIB. A 
   detailed list of differences can be found in Appendix A. 
    
   2.1. IPv6 Interfaces 
    
   IPv6 interfaces attach to links [RFC2460]. A link is roughly defined 
   as the layer below IPv6 (e.g. Ethernet, IPv4 Tunnel). One or more 
   IPv6 prefixes can be associated with an IPv6 interface. IPv6 
   interfaces and the prefixes associated with those interfaces can be 
   configured via the IPV6-MIB [RFC2465]. IPv6 interfaces are configured 
   in the IPv6 Interface Table and IPv6 prefixes are configured in the 
   IPv6 Address Prefix Table. An IPv6 interface is identified by a 
   unique index value. IPv6 Address Prefix Table entries associated with 
   an IPv6 interface reference the interface's index. 
    
   Whereas an interface identifier in OSPFv2 is a local IPv4 address or 
   MIB-2 interface index, an OSPFv3 interface identifier is an IPv6 
   interface index. For example, the index value of an OSPFv3 Interface 
   Table entry is the IPv6 interface index of the IPv6 interface over 
   which OSPFv3 is configured to operate. 
    
   2.2. Addressing Semantics 
    
   Router ID, Area ID and Link State ID remain at the OSPFv2 size of 32 
   bits. To ensure uniqueness, a router running both IPv4 and IPv6 
   concurrently can continue to use a local IPv4 host address, 
   represented as an unsigned 32-bit value, as the OSPFv3 Router ID. 
   Otherwise, the Router ID must be selected using another method (e.g. 
   administratively assigned). 
    
   Router ID, Area ID and Link State ID do not have addressing semantics 
   in OSPFv3, so their syntax is changed to Unsigned32. The order of the 
   Router ID and Link State ID index components in Link State Database 
   Tables are reversed in OSPFv3 since the lack of addressing semantics 
   in Link State IDs make them less unique identifiers than the Router 
   ID. It is more useful to do partial OID lookups extending to the 
   Router ID rather than the Link State ID. 
     
   2.3. Authentication 
    
   In OSPFv3, authentication has been removed from the protocol itself. 
   MIB objects related to authentication are not carried forward from 
   the OSPFv2 MIB. 
    
   2.4. Type of Service 
  
Internet Draft          Expires November 2005                [Page 3] 
                              OSPFv3 MIB                      May 2005 
 
 
    
   OSPFv2 MIB objects related to Type of Service (ToS) are not carried 
   forward to the OSPFv3 MIB.  
    
   2.5. Flooding Scope 
    
   Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized and is now explicitly 
   encoded in the LSA's LS type field. The action to take upon receipt 
   of unknown LSA types is also encoded in the LS type field [RFC2740]. 
   The OSPFv3 MIB defines three Link State Database tables, one each 
   for Area-scope LSAs, Link-scope LSAs and AS-scope LSAs. 
    
   2.6. Virtual Links 
    
   Since addressing semantics have been removed from router-LSAs in 
   OSPFv3, Virtual Links now need to be assigned an interface ID for 
   advertisement in Hello packets and in router-LSAs. An object has 
   been added to the Virtual Interface Table entry for this purpose. 
 
   2.7. Neighbors 
 
   The OSPFv2 Neighbor Table has been split into two tables. The OSPFv3 
   Neighbor Table is a read-only table and it contains information 
   learned from Hellos received from neighbors, including Configured 
   neighbors. The OSPFv3 Configured Neighbor Table contains entries for 
   manually configured neighbors and neighbors dynamically discovered by 
   lower-level protocols such as Inverse Neighbor Discovery. 
 
    
3. Structure of the OSPFv3 MIB 
    
   The MIB is composed of the following sections: 
    
        General Variables 
        Area Table 
        Area-Scope Link State Database 
        Link-Scope Link State Database 
        AS-Scope Link State Database 
        Host Table 
        Interface Table 
        Virtual Interface Table 
        Neighbor Table 
        Configured Neighbor Table 
        Virtual Neighbor Table 
        Aggregate Range Table 
    
   3.1. General Variables 
    
   The General Variables are global to the OSPFv3 Process. 
    
   3.2. Area Table 
    
   The Area Data Structure describes the OSPFv3 Areas that the

   router participates in. 
    
   3.3. Area-Scope, Link-Scope and AS-Scope Link State Database 
    
   The Link State Databases are provided primarily to provide 
   detailed information for network debugging. 
    
   3.4. Host Table 
    
   The Host Table is provided to view configured Host Route 
   information. 
    
   3.5. Interface Table 
    
   The Interface Table describes the various IPv6 links on which 
   OSPFv3 is configured. 
    
   3.6. Virtual Interface Table 
    
   The Virtual Interface Table describes virtual OSPFv3 links. 
    
   3.7. Neighbor, Configured Neighbor and Virtual Neighbor Tables 
    
   The Neighbor Table, the Configured Neighbor Table and the Virtual 
   Neighbor Table describe the neighbors to the OSPFv3 Process. 
    
   3.8. Aggregate Range Table 
    
   The Aggregate Range Table describes prefixes, which summarize 
   routing information for export outside of an Area.

5. IANA Considerations 
 
   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
    
        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
        ----------        ----------------------- 
    
        ospfv3MIB           { mib-2 XXX } 
    
   [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  the IANA is 
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and 
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the 
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" 
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove 
   this note.]

9. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB 
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. 
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some 
   network environments. The support for SET operations in a 
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
   negative effect on network operations. 
 
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then the customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.

12. Differences from RFC 1850 
    
     (1)  Textual Conventions are imported  from  INET-ADDRESS-MIB, 
          IF-MIB and OSPF-MIB MIBs. 
 
     (2)  The  "ospf"  prefix  for  entity  names  is  changed   to 
          "ospfv3". 
 
     (3)  General Group object name ospfVersionNumber is changed to 
          ospfv3VersionNumber and its value is changed from 2 to 3. 
 
     (4)  General Group object name ospfExternLsaCount  is  changed

          to  ospfv3AsScopeLsaCount  to  indicate  count of all AS- 
          scoped LSAs in the database. 
 
     (5)  General  Group  object  name   ospfExternLsaCksumSum   is 
          changed  to ospfv3AsScopeCksumSum to indicate checksum of 
          all AS-scoped LSAs in the database. 
 
     (6)  Removed General Group object ospfTOSSupport. 
 
     (7)  Removed ospfAuthType object from Area entry. 
 
     (8)  Changed     object     names     ospfAreaLsaCount     and 
          ospfAreaLsaCksumSum    to   ospfv3AreaScopeLsaCount   and 
          ospfv3AreaScopeLsaCksumSum. 
 
     (9)  Removed OSPF Area Default Metric Table. 
 
     (10) Added object ospfv3StubMetric to Area entry as substitute 
          for Area Default Metric Table. 
 
     (11) Changed name of External  LSDB  Table  to  AS-Scope  LSDB 
          Table.   Replaced  object  name prefix "ospfExtLsdb" with 
          "ospfv3AsLsdb". 
 
     (12) Changed name of LSDB  Table  to  Area-Scope  LSDB  Table. 
          Replaced    object    name    prefix    "ospfLsdb"   with 
          "ospfv3AreaLsdb". 
 
     (13) Added ospfv3LinkLsdbTable  which  contains  all  LSAs  of 
          Link-Scope. Index  of  ospfv3LinkLsdbTable  is  interface 
          index, LSA Type, Router ID and LSID. 
 
     (14) Re-ordered Router ID and LSID index  components  of  LSDB 
          table  entries.   Since  LSIDs  no longer have addressing 
          semantics, GET-NEXT operations on partial OIDs  are  more 
          useful when the Router ID component comes before the LSID 
          component. 
 
     (15) Address Range Table is removed. 
 
     (16) Removed  ospfHostTOS  from  Host  Table   entry.   Object 
          ospfHostIpAddress  changed  to ospfv3HostAddress with 
          SYNTAX changed from IpAddress to InetAddress. 
 
     (17) Added object ospfv3HostAddressType to Host Table entry to 
          determine the address type of ospfv3HostAddress. 
 
     (18) The  MAX-ACCESS  value  of  object  ospfv3HostAreaID   is 
          changed to read-create. 
 
     (19) Objects  ospfIfIpAddress  and  ospfAddressLessIf  removed 
          from  Interface  entry and as Interface Table entry index 
          components.

     (20) Object ospfv3IfIndex added to Interface Table entry  with 
          SYNTAX  InterfaceIndex. It  replaces  ospfIfIpAddress and 
          ospfAddressLessIf as the Interface Table entry index. 
 
     (21) The  SYNTAX   of   objects   ospfIfDesignatedRouter   and 
          ospfIfBackupDesignatedRouter is changed from IpAddress to 
          RouterID. 
 
     (22) Objects ospfIfAuthType and ospfIfAuthKey are removed from 
          Interface and Virtual Interface entries. 
 
     (23) Added     objects      ospfv3IfLinkScopeLsaCount      and 
          ospfv3IfLinkLsaCksumSum to Interface entry. They maintain 
          the count of Link-Scope LSAs  and  the  checksum  of  the 
          Link-Scope LSA database associated with the interface. 
 
     (24) Removed  OSPF  Interface  Metric  Table.  Metric  is  now 
          accessed  via object ospfv3IfMetricValue in the Interface 
          entry. 
 
     (25) Added object ospfv3IfInstId to Interface entry to  enable 
          the  setting  of  the  interface  instance  value  of the 
          interface. The default value is zero. 
 
     (26) Added object ospfv3VirtIfIndex to Virtual Interface entry 
          which  is  used  to  assign  a  local interface ID to the 
          virtual interface. 
 
     (27) Added    objects    ospfv3VirtIfLinkScopeLsaCount     and 
          ospfv3VirtIfLinkLsaCksumSum  to  Virtual Interface entry. 
          They maintain  the  count  of  Link-Scope  LSAs  and  the 
          checksum  of  the Link-Scope LSA database associated with 
          the virtual interface. 
 
     (28) The Neighbor Table (ospfv3NbrTable) is a read-only  table 
          and it contains only the neighbors that were learned from 
          LSAs. 
 
     (29) Removed objects ospfNbrIpAddr and ospfNbrAddressLessIndex 
          from Neighbor entry. 
 
     (30) Added object ospfv3NbrIfIndex to Neighbor  entry.   Index 
          components  ospfNbrIpAddr and ospfNbrAddressLessIndex are 
          replaced with ospfv3NbrIfIndex and ospfv3NbrRtrId. 
 
     (31) Added object ospfv3NbrAddressType to  Neighbor  entry  to 
          determine the address type of ospfv3NbrAddress. 
 
     (32) Added object ospfv3NbrAddress  to  Neighbor  entry.  This 
          object contains the neighbor's IPv6 address. 
 
     (33) Removed        objects        ospfCfgNbrStatus       and

          ospfCfgNbrPermanence from Neighbor entry. 
 
     (34) Added object ospfv3NbrIfId to Neighbor entry. This object 
          contains  the  neighbor's  local interface index from the 
          neighbor's hellos advertised on the link. 
 
     (35) The  MAX-ACCESS  value  of  object   ospfNbrPriority   is 
          changed  to  read-only.   Removed   DEFVAL   for   object 
          ospfv3NbrPriority. 
 
     (36) Added  ospfv3CfgNbrTable (Configured Neighbor Table) which 
          contains all  manually  configured  neighbors.  Index  of 
          ospfv3CfgNbrTable        is        ospfv3CfgNbrIfIndex, 
          ospfv3CfgAddressType,              ospfv3CfgNbrAddress. 
 
 
 
     (37) Added object  ospfv3VirtNbrIfIndex  to  Virtual  Neighbor 
          entry.  This  is  the interface index of the virtual link 
          over which the virtual neighbor is reached. 
 
     (38) Changed     object     name     ospfVirtNbrIpAddr      to 
          ospfv3VirtNbrAddress   and   SYNTAX  from  IpAddress   to 
          InetAddress. 
 
     (39) Added object ospfv3VirtNbrAddressType to Virtual Neighbor 
          entry     to    determine    the    address    type    of 
          ospfv3VirtNbrAddress. 
 
     (40) Added object ospfv3VirtNbrIfId to Virtual Neighbor entry. 
          This  is  the  virtual neighbor's local virtual interface 
          index  from  the  neighbor's  hellos  advertised  on  the 
          virtual link. 
 
     (41) Changed    object     name    ospfAreaAggregateMask    to 
          ospfv3AreaAggregatePrefixLenth and SYNTAX from  IpAddress 
          to InetAddressPrefixLength.
