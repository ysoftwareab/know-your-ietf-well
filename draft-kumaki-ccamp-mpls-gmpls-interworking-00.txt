Abstract 
    
   In order to deploy GMPLS technology in the existing IP/ MPLS 
   networks, some interworking aspect of GMPLS/ MPLS needs to be 
   addressed. One of the important aspects of MPLS/ GMPLS interworking 
   is ability to effectively use GMPLS services in IP/ MPLS networks. 
   This includes ability to specify GMPLS LSPs in signaling requests 
   based on the type of the setup desired, as well as considerations for 
   the operation aspects of using GMPLS LSPs. 
    
   In this draft, we highlight some MPLS/ GMPLS interworking 
   requirements and propose solutions to address them. We also highlight 
   some operation aspects of the possible solution and provide 
   applicability statement for the available options.

1. Introduction 
 
   Introduction of GMPLS technology in existing IP/ MPLS networks and 
   migration of IP/ MPLS services to GMPLS core poses some new 
   requirements that does not exists while using point to point physical 
   links in the core network. Specifically, GMPLS technology is equipped 
   with features like priority management and protection and 
   restoration. These features have some implications on how IP/ MPLS 
   networks can utilize forwarding and/ or routing adjacencies 
   established on top of GMPLS networks. In this draft, we highlight 
   these implications/ requirements and propose solutions to address 
   them. In this fashion this draft complements [GMPLS-migration] draft, 
   which formalizes the MPLS/ GMPLS interworking problem. Using the 
   terminology used in [GMPLS-migration], this draft addresses only 
   MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS case.  
    
   Feature richness of MPLS and GMPLS technology allows service 
   providers to use a set of options on how GMPLS services can be used 
   by IP/ MPLS networks. However, there are some operational 
   considerations and pros and cons associated with the individual 
   options. This draft also highlights some operations considerations 
   associated with use of GMPLS services by IP/ MPLS networks. 
    
2. Static vs. signaling triggered dynamic FA-LSPs 
    
   From signaling prospective, clearly there are two alternatives in 
   which setup for GMPLS tunnel can be triggered: Static (pre-

   configured) and Dynamic (on-demand based on signaling setup request 
   for MPLS LSP).  
 
   Decision to establish new Static GMPLS LSPs are made either by the 
   operator or automatically (e.g., using features like TE auto-mesh). 
   In either case, Static FA-LSP are established and advertised prior to 
   setup of MPLS LSPs using them in the ERO. In case of static FA-LSP, 
   if MPLS LSP setup request (MPLS RSVP Path message) cannot be 
   satisfied by existing Static FA-LSPs, it is rejected.  
 
   Dynamic FA-LSP is triggered by RSVP Path message for setting up an 
   MPLS LSP. Please note that dynamic FA-LSPs can be virtual FAs from 
   routing prospective. In either case, LSP creation from signaling 
   prospective is triggered by the MPLS RSVP Path message received at a 
   MPLS/ GMPLS border router.  
 
   In the case of Static or Virtual FA-LSPs, the FA may be specified in 
   an ERO encoded as strict ERO. In the case where FA-LSPs are dynamic 
   and are not advertised as virtual links in the MPLS TE topology, MPLS 
   signaling request (MPLS RSVP Path message) contains a loose ERO, and 
   GMPLS LSP selection is a local decision at the border router. In the 
   case of Static or Virtual FA-LSPs, a signaling request may also be 
   encoded as loose ERO.  
    
   When the border router receives the signaling setup request and 
   determines that in order for it to extend the loose ERO content, it 
   needs to create GMPLS FA-LSP. Consequently, it signals a GMPLS LSP 
   respecting MPLS/ GMPLS signaling interworking aspects discussed in 
   sections 4.1 and 4.2. Once the GMPLS FA-LSP is fully established, the 
   ERO contents for the MPLS signaling setup request are extended to use 
   the GMPLS LSP and signaling setup for the FA-LSP are carried in-band 
   of the GMPLS LSP. The GMPLS LSP can then also be advertised as an FA-
   LSP in MPLS TE topology or an IGP adjacency can be brought up on the 
   GMPLS LSP. 
    
3. MPLS/ GMPLS LSP Priority Mapping 
    
   Both MPLS and GMPLS LSPs are signaled for specific setup and hold 
   priority, based on the importance of traffic carried over them. For 
   proper operation of the network, it is desirable to create/ use GMPLS 
   LSPs of specified setup and hold priority, based on the setup and 
   hold priority of the MPLS LSPs using them.  
    
   In the following, we discuss several approaches possible for mapping 
   setup and hold priority of MPLS LSPs to GMPLS FA-LSPs.

   1) Exact Match: In this case setup and hold priority of the GMPLS FA-
   LSP is same as setup and hold priority of MPLS LSP using it. In other 
   words, GMPLS LSP Priority set = MPLS LSP Priority set. 
    
   2) Better Priority: In this case GMPLS FA-LSP can be of setup and 
   hold priority equal better than the MPLS LSP using it. In other 
   words, GMPLS LSP Priority set <= MPLS LSP Priority set.  
    
   3) Dynamic Priority for GMPLS LSP: In this case priority of GMPLS LSP 
   is dynamically changed based on priority of the MPLS LSPs using it. 
   In other words, GMPLS LSP Priority set = min (MPLS LSP Priority set).  
    
   4) Any to Any Mapping Matrix: Based on some policies, it is possible 
   to have any-to-any mapping for MPLS/ GMPLS priority mapping at the 
   MPLS/ GMPLS border router.  
    
   5) No Priority Management in GMPLS core: In this simple minded 
   approach all GMPLS LSPs can be establish with setup and hold priority 
   of "0", i.e., the GMPLS LSPs are already set as better match. In this 
   case, priority management is handled purely at MPLS layer, with GMPLS 
   network providing L1 connectivity without priority management. 
 
   In the case of a strict ERO, a remote MPLS node can only select an 
   FA-LSP during its SPF calculation if it knows the setup and hold 
   priority of the GMPLS FA-LSP. In the following, we propose some 
   routing extension that can be used by the border routers to advertise 
   setup and hold priorities of the FA-LSPs or ability/ wiliness to 
   dynamically change setup and hold priority of the FA-LSP.   
    
3.1 OSPF extensions for Link Priority Identification 
    
   This section we define the enhancements to the TE properties of GMPLS 
   TE links that can be announced in OSPF TE LSAs [OSPF-TE] to carry 
   link state information regarding setup and hold priority of the FA-
   LSP. Specifically, we add the following sub-TLV to the Link TLV: 
    
      Sub-TLV Type      Length    Name 
               TBD           4    Link Priority Identifiers 
    
   Link Priority Identifiers 
    
   A  Link Priority Identifiers is a sub-TLV of the Link TLV. This 
   identifier carries the setup and hold priority for the FA-LSP links.  
    
   The type of this sub-TLV is TBD, and length is four octets. The 
   following Figure illustrates encoding of the link priority 
   Identifiers sub-TLV.

   The value field of this sub-TLV contains one octet of setup priority 
   of the FA-LSP, followed by one octet of hold priority of the FA-LSP. 
   Based on a local policy, advertising LSR may be able to dynamically 
   adjust priority of the FA-LSP, in which case it sets ôDö bit in the 
   following octet (as shown above). The remaining bits SHOULD be set to 
   zero by the sender, and SHOULD be ignored by the receiver. 
    
   This setup and hold priority parameters are copied from the values 
   carried in the RSVP Session Attribute Object when the FA-LSP is 
   signaled. Please refer to [RFC3209] for details on the setup and hold 
   priorities parameters and how they are encoded. Inclusion of this 
   sub-TLV is not needed for the physical links, however one may carry 
   it with setup and hold priorities set to 0. 
 
3.2 ISIS extensions for Link Priority Identification 
    
    
   This section we define the enhancements to the extended IS 
   reachability TLV (see [ISIS-TE]).  Specifically, we add the following 
   sub-TLVs: 
    
      Sub-TLV Type      Length    Name 
               TBD           4    Link Priority Identifiers

   A Link Priority Identifiers is a sub-TLV of the extended IS 
   reachability TLV. This identifier carries the setup and hold priority 
   for the FA-LSP links. 
    
   The type of this sub-TLV is TBD, and length is four octets. The 
   following Figure illustrates encoding of the Link Priority 
   Identifiers sub-TLV.

   of the FA-LSP, followed by one octet of hold priority of the FA-LSP. 
   Based on a local policy, advertising LSR may be able to dynamically

   signaled. Please refer to [RFC3209] for details on the setup and hold 
   priorities parameters and how they are encoded. Inclusion of this 
   sub-TLV is not needed for the physical links, however one may carry 
   it with setup and hold priorities set to 0. 
    
4. Signaling Protected MPLS LSPs 
    
   When MPLS LSPs are protected using MPLS-FRR mechanism [TE-FRR] and it 
   may be desired to signal MPLS LSP such that it uses protected GMPLS 
   tunnel FA-LSPs. In this section we discuss MPLS/ GMPLS interworking 
   aspect for protected MPLS LSPs.  
    
   In the case of loose ERO, where selection of GMPLS FA-LSP is a left 
   for the border nodes and ôLocal protection desiredö flag of the 
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object is set, the border router SHOULD try to map 
   the signaling setup request to a GMPLS LSP which is protected within 
   GMPLS domain. However, in the case of strict ERO, the selection of 
   GMPLS FA-LSP is based on the contents of the ERO and ôLocal 
   protection desiredö flag is ignored. 
    
5. Applicability 
    
   In this section we discuss some operational considerations and pros 
   and cons associated with the individual options listed in Section 3. 
    
5.1 Applicability of the Priority Management Options 
    
   In section 4.1, various options from exact match to no priority 
   management in GMPLS network are discussed. This section provides an 
   applicability of these options.  
    
   The benefit of Priority Management in GMPLS Core comes at the cost of 
   bandwidth fragmentation. E.g., in simplest approach of exact match, 
   we need at least as many GMPLS LSPs, as there are priority 
   combination in the network, while the other extreme of no priority 
   management in GMPLS network does allow full aggregation of MPLS 
   traffic on GMPLS FAs, i.e. avoids bandwidth fragmentation. If IGP 
   adjacency is to be established over the GMPLS LSPs, having more GMPLS

[Page 7] 
          draft-kumaki-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interworking-00.txt     Feb. 2005 
 
 
   LSP leads to more links in the IGP/ IP topology. The same is true of 
   MPLS TE topology with the exception that FA-LSPs can be bundled to 
   avoid flooding of multiple TE links.  
    
   With priority management within GMPLS network, there is a danger of 
   creating oscillations in the IP/MPLS network using GMPLS. This is 
   because when a new FA-LSP is established based on a local routing 
   decision made at the border router; we can have undesirable 
   preemption affecting MPLS LSPs carried over the GMPLS LSP that is 
   being preempted. This can have cascading affect leading to 
   oscillations on the operation of MPLS traffic.  
 
5.2 Applicability of the Signaling Triggered Dynamic FA-LSP  
    
   In this section, we discussed applicability of static vs. dynamic FA-
   LSPs. It is important to realize that we can have FA-LSPs that are 
   created dynamically based on triggers like configuration, link 
   utilization level, etc. However, in the context of this document, 
   such FA-LSPs are considered as static FAs. In this document, the term 
   dynamic FA-LSPs are used for FA-LSPs that are triggered by RSVP Path 
   message for MPLS LSP. 
    
   Signaling triggered dynamic FA-LSPs are addressing a problem space 
   where traffic pattern cannot be predicted or objective is to optimize 
   operations of the network based on actually signaled request rather 
   than predicted use of the network resource (i.e., off-line traffic 
   engineering).  
    
   The problem with the use of signaling triggered dynamic FA-LSPs is 
   that we loose ability to better aggregate the traffic request at the 
   border routers. This leads to potential cases of bandwidth 
   fragmentation inside GMPLS core, which has disadvantages discussed in 
   Section 4.2. Furthermore, signaling triggered dynamic FA-LSPs coupled 
   with preemption can lead to oscillations in the operation of the 
   network. This is because when a new FA-LSP is dynamically established 
   based on a local routing decision made at the border router; we can 
   have undesirable preemption affecting MPLS LSPs carried over the 
   GMPLS LSP that is being preempted. This can have cascading affect 
   leading to oscillations on the operation of MPLS traffic.

   The procedure presented in this document is backward compatible with 
   [RFC3630], [RFC3784], [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
