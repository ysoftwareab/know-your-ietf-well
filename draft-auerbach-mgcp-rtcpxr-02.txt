            Abstract 
             
            The main intent of this document is to define a Media Gateway Control 
            Protocol (MGCP) package to control the reporting of metrics supported 
            by the VoIP metrics block in RTCP Extended Reports as specified in [RFC 
            3611]. It also allows the call agent to control whether or not the 
            gateway will request a peer device via SDP to send the VoIP metrics 
            block in RTCP Extended Reports and whether it will respond positively 
            to such requests from the peer device. Besides this primary focus, this 
            package also allows the reporting of metrics defined for RTCP Sender 
            Reports and Receiver Reports [RFC 3550] and the reporting of session 
            description parameters (based on the ones defined in RFC 2327, RFC 2198 
            etc.).

            1. Introduction 
             
            This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) [RFC 
            3435] package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that 
            measure the quality of traffic on two-way VoIP connections. This 
            capability is based on and utilizes the VoIP Metrics Block of the RTCP 
            Extended Report as specified in [RFC 3611].  
             
            Kumar et al            Informational                 Page 2 
            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             6/14/2005 
            In accordance with [RFC 3435], the term "gateway" is used to denote the 
            device controlled via MGCP. This is not intended to preclude the use of 
            MGCP or of this package to control devices that are not, in the 
            strictest terms, media gateways. For the purposes of this package, the 
            terms "gateway" and "endpoint" are used interchangeably. 
             
            In addition to the parameters in the RTCP XR VoIP metrics block, this 
            package allows the collection of statistics defined for RTCP Sender 
            Reports and Receiver Reports [RFC 3550]. The ConnectionParameters 
            structure [RFC 3435] allows the reporting of the local, but not the 
            remote, version of statistics defined for RTCP Sender Reports and 
            Receiver Reports [RFC 3550]. To report both the local and remote 
            versions of these RTP statistics, this package may be used. Note that 
            this package does not affect the collection or reporting of connection 
            parameters defined in the base MGCP specification (RFC 3435). Nor does 
            it affect the sending of RTCP Sender Reports (SR) and Receiver Reports 
            (RR). 
             
            This package also includes session description parameters (based on the 
            ones defined in RFC 2327, RFC 2198 etc.). These may be reported via 
            this package to obviate the need for call agents to snoop SDP session 
            descriptors. 
             
            This package makes a distinction between collecting, responding and 
            reporting. The term "collecting" refers to the process of calculating 
            and accumulating local metric data and accumulating remote metric data 
            received in RTCP Sender, Receiver and Extended Reports from the remote 
            device.  The term "responding" in the context of this package is 
            limited to the sending of accumulated local metric data via RTCP 
            Extended Reports to the remote device as specified in [RFC 3611]. Note 
            that this package does not control the communication of session 
            statistics via RTCP Sender Reports (SR) and Receiver Reports (RR). 
            These reports MUST be sent in the manner required of all RTP endpoints 
            [RFC 3550]. The term "reporting" refers to the process of reporting the 
            accumulated local and remote metric data for the connection to the Call 
            Agent in either a DeleteConnection, ModifyConnection or AuditConnection 
            command sequence.  
             
            An endpoint will "collect" local session metrics for several reasons: 
             
               - To report metrics in the "northbound" direction via the XRM/LVM 
                 and XRM/RVM parameters specified in this package. 
               - To communicate metrics in the "east-west" direction via RTCP 
                 extended reports, 
               - To report metrics in the "northbound" direction via other 
                 mechanisms such as connection parameters [RFC 3435] and log 
                 transfers not addressed in this document,  
               - To communicate metrics in the "east-west" direction via RTCP 
                 Sender Reports and Receiver Reports. 
             
            The sets of metrics collected for these purposes are not the same. This 
            package is limited to defining the metrics that may be reported via the 
            XRM/LVM and XRM/RVM lines. This may or may not be a superset of the 
            Kumar et al            Informational                 Page 3 
            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             6/14/2005 
            metrics that may be communicated via the VoIP metrics block in RTCP 
            extended reports. 
             
            The Call Agent can ask an endpoint to enable or disable the reporting 
            of metrics via this package. Enabling this reporting also enables the 
            "east-west" communication of metrics via the RTCP XR VoIP metrics block 
            from the local endpoint's perspective. Whether this "east-west" 
            communication actually takes place also depends on the peer endpoint's 
            capabilities. When it disables "northbound" reporting via this package, 
            the call agent may either disable the "east-west" communication of 
            metrics via the RTCP XR VoIP metrics block, or it may require the 
            endpoint to communicate the VoIP metrics block in the "east-west" 
            direction if the remote end requests it. Disabling "northbound" 
            reporting via this package has no impact on the use of RTCP Sender 
            Reports or Receiver Reports. 
             
            The metric data reported to the Call Agent via this package when a 
            connection is deleted, modified or audited represents the data that was 
            accumulated since:  
             
               - the start of the session, or,  
               - the last metrics reset, whether autonomous or commanded by the 
                 call agent. An autonomous reset occurs when the media changes its 
                 mode e.g. from voice to voice band data. A commanded reset may 
                 occur when the call agent modifies the connection in response to 
                 feature invocations, such as call transfer or call pick-up. 
             
            The VoIP Metrics package definition is provided in Section 2. This 
            includes a detailed description of relevant MGCP protocol procedures, a 
            list of parameters that can be reported via this package, and an 
            analysis of the applicability of these parameters to voice band data. 
            In  Section 3, we provide four call flow examples showing how to use 
            the package.  Security considerations are found in Section 4, followed 
            by the IANA considerations and references. Table 1 lists the metrics 
            based on the VoIP metrics block in RTCP Extended Reports [RFC 3611]. 
            Table 2 lists the metrics based on RTCP Sender Reports and Receiver 
            Reports [RFC 3550]. Note that Table 2 uses the metrics definitions in 
            [RFC 3550] and [RFC 3435] as is, without attempting to improve them by, 
            for instance, specifying a better method for handling duplicates. Table 
            3 lists session parameters, most of which are from RFCs which define 
            SDP constructs (e.g. RFC 2327, RFC 2198, RFC 2733).   
              
            2. VoIP Session Metrics Package Definition 
             
            A package is defined for VoIP session  metrics. Here, the term "VoIP" 
            is used in a broad manner that includes voice band data. 
             
            Package Name:    XRM 
            Package Version: 0 
             
            This package defines the following parameters: 
             
            -    A new local connections option, "mcr" (Metrics Reporting) for 
                 enabling and disabling metrics reporting via this package. Note 
            Kumar et al            Informational                 Page 4 
            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             6/14/2005 
                 that metrics collection might also be contingent upon other 
                 factors not affected by this package (e.g. the connection 
                 parameters in the base MGCP specification, RFC 3435). 
            -    A new parameter line, "MMO" (Media Metrics Option) that allows 
                 the call agent to request local and remote metrics in a modify 
                 connection response, and/or to reset the local and remote 
                 metrics. 
            -    A new parameter line, "LVM" (Local VoIP Metrics), for reporting  
                 locally collected metrics. 
            -    A new parameter line, "RVM" (Remote VoIP Metrics), for reporting 
                 remotely collected metrics communicated to the reporting endpoint 
                 via RTCP Extended Reports, Sender Reports and Receiver Reports. 
             
            2.1 Local Connection Options 
             
            The local connection option (LCO) parameter, "xrm/mcr", is an optional 
            parameter with one of the following  three values: 
             
               - "off": Disables the reporting of metrics via this package AND the 
                 "east-west" communication of metrics via the RTCP XR VoIP metrics 
                 block 
               - "on": Enables the reporting of metrics via this package AND the 
                 "east-west" communication of metrics via the RTCP XR VoIP metrics 
                 block. Whether this "east-west" communication actually takes 
                 place also depends on the peer endpoint's capabilities. 
               - "negotiate": Disables the reporting of metrics via this package. 
                 However, the endpoint is required to communicate the VoIP metrics 
                 block in the "east-west" direction if the remote end requests it. 
              
            For example, 
             
            L: a:PCMU, xrm/mcr: on 
             
            assigns a value of "on" to the "mcr" LCO. 
                  
            In CreateConnection commands, the xrm/mcr LCO value defaults to 
            "negotiate".  In ModifyConnection commands, the xrm/mcr LCO value 
            defaults to its current value for the connection.  Thus, if 
            LocalConnectionOptions are either omitted or the xrm/mcr LCO is not 
            included in a ModifyConnection command, the previous xrm/mcr LCO value 
            for the connection is retained. 
             
            An MGCP endpoint supporting this package SHALL always use SDP to 
            request the VoIP metrics block from the remote device if the value of 
            the "xrm/mcr" LCO is set to "on".  However, even if the value of value 
            of the "xrm/mcr" LCO is "on" or "negotiate", the endpoint SHALL NOT 
            send the VoIP metrics block in RTCP Extended Reports (XR) unless the 
            remote  device has requested this block via SDP signaling. Thus, for 
            MGCP endpoints supporting this package, the permission in [RFC 3611] to 
            send RTCP XR blocks in the absence of the "rtcp-xr" SDP attribute is 
            revoked. 
             
            Note that the value of the "xrm/mcr" LCO does not affect the collection 
            or reporting of connection parameters in the connection parameters line

            (P: line) as defined in the base MGCP specification [RFC 3435]. Nor 
            does it affect the sending of RTCP Sender Reports (SR) and Receiver 
            Reports (RR). An endpoint supporting this package MUST continue to 
            include the connection parameters (P:) line in an audit connection 
            response where this data is requested, in a delete connection response 
            and in a gateway-initiated delete connection. There can be overlap if 
            equivalent parameters are also reported via this package in procedures 
            for the deletion and audit of connections. There is no overlap in the 
            case of modify connection responses since these do not include the 
            connection parameters line. 
             
            2.1.1  Responses to the xrm/mcr local connection option 
             
            This section details the endpoint's response to each of the xrm/mcr LCO 
            values.  
             
            2.1.1.1     Response to a value of "off" 
             
            On receiving this value, the endpoint MUST erase any local or remote 
            VoIP metric data previously collected for the connection, and MUST 
            instruct the far-end device to stop sending RTCP XR VoIP Metrics Report 
            Blocks.  The endpoint MUST ignore an SDP request for metrics and MUST 
            NOT transmit local metrics to the peer  device.  The local endpoint 
            MUST NOT report XR metrics upon receiving or initiating a 
            DeleteConnection sequence and MUST NOT report XR metrics when 
            responding to a ModifyConnection command or an AuditConnection 
            command.  
             
            2.1.1.2     Response to a value of "on" 
             
            On receiving this value in a CreateConnection or ModifyConnection 
            command, if not already doing so, the endpoint MUST: 
             
               - Start collecting/calculating the metrics which it will expose to 
                 the Call Agent via this package.  
               - Instruct the far-end device to start sending the VoIP Metrics 
                 block in RTCP Extended Reports by including an "rtcp-xr" 
                 attribute with a value of "voip-metrics" in the SDP.   
               - Report local and remote metrics via the XRM/LVM and XRM/RVM lines 
                 defined below in the response to DeleteConnection that targets a 
                 single connection, in the response to a ModifyConnection when 
                 these metrics are requested, in the response to an 
                 AuditConnection when these metrics are audited, and when sending 
                 a DeleteConnection command for a single connection.    
              
            2.1.1.3     Response to a value of "negotiate" 
             
            On receiving this value, the endpoint disables the "northbound" 
            reporting of metrics, via this package,  to the call agent. Also, it 
            sets an internal flag to indicate that it will respond positively to 
            SDP requests by the remote peer device to send the VoIP metrics block 
            in RTCP Extended Reports.

            2.1.2  Impact of the xrm/mcr LCO on VoIP metrics block exchange 
             
            This section details the concepts introduced in the previous section 
            regarding the use of the xrm/mcr local connection option to govern the 
            endpoint's behavior regarding the negotiation, via SDP, of the VoIP 
            metrics block in RTCP extended reports [RFC 3611]. 
             
            RFC 3611 adds a new SDP attribute called "rtcp-xr" that can be used by 
            an endpoint to ask the remote  device to send RTCP Extended Reports. 
            This attribute is encoded as follows:   
             
                 rtcp-xr:<xr-format> 
             
            This rtcp-xr attribute can be used as either a session-level or media-
            level attribute. See [RFC 3611] for more information. Only one of  the 
            xr-format values, voip-metrics,  is within the scope of this package.  
             
            For an endpoint supporting this package, the inclusion of the voip-
            metrics value in an rtcp-xr attribute line in its SDP local session 
            descriptions SHALL  be per the following rules: 
             
               - The voip-metrics value SHALL be included if the xrm/mcr LCO is 
                 set to "on". 
               - The voip-metrics value SHALL NOT be included if the xrm/mcr LCO 
                 is set to "off" or "negotiate". 
             
            The inclusion or exclusion of any other xr-format values (denoting 
            other RTCP XR blocks) in the rtcp-xr SDP attribute line is independent 
            of the xrm/mcr LCO. This is not addressed by this package. 
             
            The response of an endpoint supporting this package to the receipt from 
            a remote peer of an SDP remote session description with an rtcp-xr 
            attribute line that has voip-metrics as one of its values (or its only 
            value) shall be as follows: 
             
               - The endpoint MUST send RTCP Extended Reports with the VoIP 
                 metrics block to the remote peer if the xrm/mcr LCO is "on" or 
                 "negotiate". 
               - The endpoint SHALL NOT send RTCP Extended Reports with the VoIP 
                 metrics block to the remote peer if the xrm/mcr LCO is "off". 
             
            Regardless of the value of the xrm/mcr LCO, an endpoint supporting this 
            package SHALL NOT send RTCP Extended Reports with the VoIP metrics 
            block to the remote peer if any of the following is true: 
             
               - The rtcp-xr attribute is not included in the SDP remote session 
                 description. 
               - The rtcp-xr attribute is included in the SDP remote session 
                 description but "voip-metrics" is not one of its values. This 
                 includes the case in which the attribute has an empty parameter 
                 list. 
             
            [RFC 3611] allows endpoints that uses SDP (e.g. MGCP endpoints) to 
            exchange RTCP Extended Reports without prior SDP signaling, which is 
            Kumar et al            Informational                 Page 7 
            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             6/14/2005 
            optional. This allowance is rescinded for endpoints supporting this 
            package which MUST implement the SDP signalling specified in this 
            section.  
             
            2.2 MGCP Protocol Procedures  
             
            2.2.1 DeleteConnection Procedures 
             
            These procedures refer to call agent-initiated delete connection 
            commands that are targeted at a specific connection ID and to gateway-
            initiated delete connection commands. They do not apply to call agent-
            initiated delete connection commands that are targeted at all 
            connections associated with a call, an endpoint, an endpoint group or a 
            gateway. In the latter case, the XRM/LVM and XRM/RVM lines (described 
            in detail below) SHALL NOT be returned. 
             
            Endpoints supporting this package MUST report local metrics in the 
            XRM/LVM parameter line in delete connection responses and in gateway-
            initiated delete connection commands if and only if the local 
            connection option xrm/mcr is set to "on". 
             
            Endpoints supporting this package MUST report remote metrics, if 
            available, in the XRM/RVM parameter line in delete connection responses 
            and in gateway-initiated delete connection commands if and only if the 
            local connection option xrm/mcr is set to "on". 
              
            We do not define a mechanism for suppressing metrics reporting in 
            response to a delete connection command that is targeted at a specific 
            connection ID. In situations (such as a switchover)where the call agent 
            needs to delete connections without retaining any records of the 
            connections, it can use the version of the delete connection procedure 
            that targets all connections associated with a call, an endpoint, an 
            endpoint group or a gateway [RFC 3435]. No metrics are returned in 
            response to this version of the delete connection command. 
             
            2.2.2 AuditConnection Procedures 
             
            This package defines two new RequestedInfo values to be used with an 
            AuditConnection (AUCX).  These allow a call agent to explicitly request 
            that the endpoint return the current values of either the local or 
            remote metrics. The request does not reset the values.  When one or 
            both of these RequestedInfo values are included in an AUCX command, the 
            endpoint MUST return the appropriate metric values if available.   The 
            two new RequestedInfo values are: 
             
                   XRM/LVM       Return the local voice metric values. 
                   XRM/RVM       Return the remote voice metric values. 
             
            The rules in the MGCP base specification [RFC 3435] for handling audits 
            of unsupported parameters and parameters for which an endpoint has no 
            values MUST be followed. As a result: 
             
               - If an endpoint that does not understand the XRM/LVM or XRM/RVM 
                 parameter is audited for that parameter, it MUST NOT generate an 
            Kumar et al            Informational                 Page 8 
            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             6/14/2005 
                 error. Instead, the parameter MUST be omitted from the audit 
                 response. Since this rule is based on the MGCP base 
                 specification, it also applies to endpoints that do not support 
                 this package. 
               - If an endpoint that does not have values for the XRM/LVM or 
                 XRM/RVM parameter is audited for that parameter, it MUST NOT 
                 generate an error. Instead, the parameter MUST be included in the 
                 audit response with an empty value. 
             
            2.2.3 ModifyConnection Procedures 
             
            This package defines a new MGCP parameter, the MediaMetricsOption 
            ("MMO") that may be optionally included in a ModifyConnection command 
            on an "XRM/MMO" line. This parameter is forbidden in all other MGCP 
            commands and responses. It can have one of the following four values: 
             
            -    "REP" (report). This option commands the endpoint to report local 
            and remote metrics via this package. Local and remote session 
            parameters MAY also be reported. 
            -    "RES" (reset). This option commands the endpoint to reset the 
            local and remote metrics.   
            -    "RR" (report and reset). Local and remote metrics are first 
            reported and then reset. Local and remote session parameters MAY also 
            be reported. 
            -    "NULL". No metrics (local or remote) are reset or reported. This 
            value is equivalent to omitting the "XRM/MMO" line in the 
            ModifyConnection command. Of course, it is more efficient and, 
            therefore, preferable to omit the XRM/MMO line than to use it with an 
            explicit value of "NULL".  
             
            Note that the XRM/MMO parameter is specific to a ModifyConnection 
            command and its value does not persist following the end of a 
            ModifyConnection procedure. Therefore, this package does not define a 
            RequestedInfo value for auditing the XRM/MMO parameter.  
             
            Also note that metrics are not reported in response to a "REP" or "RR" 
            value of the XRM/MMO parameter if the value of the XRM/MCR local 
            connection option is "off" or "negotiate".    
             
            When the value of the XRM/MMO parameter is REP or RR, then the 
            available metrics are reported, as applicable,  in the XRM/LVM and 
            XRM/RVM lines defined below. In order to comply with the ABNF rules in 
            [RFC 3435], the connection parameters line (the P: line) SHALL NOT be 
            included in a ModifyConnection response. However, metrics equivalent to 
            the connection parameters (Table 2) can be included in the XRM/LVM and 
            XRM/RVM lines. 
             
            The metrics that are reset and/or reported in response to the XRM/MMO 
            parameter include metrics associated with RTCP extended reports (Table 
            1) and metrics associated with RTCP sender reports and receiver reports 
            (Table 2).  
             
            During reset, all metrics are either set to zero or to an unknown 
            value, with the exception of session parameters that continue to apply 
            Kumar et al            Informational                 Page 9 
            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             6/14/2005 
            to the new configuration. Examples of metrics being set to an unknown 
            value at the various R factors and MOS estimates, which are set to 127. 
            An example of a session parameter which may remain unchanged is the IP 
            address of the endpoint. 
              
            The MMO parameter is needed to handle situations in which the call 
            agent invokes a feature that alters the media stream in a manner that 
            renders previous metrics values inapplicable to the new situation. 
            Examples are call transfer and call pick-up.  
             
            2.3 The LVM and RVM Lines for reporting Local And Remote Metrics 
             
            The "XRM/LVM" and "XRM/RVM" lines are for the reporting of local and 
            remote metrics respectively. For example, an endpoint that is recording 
            local metrics and has received remote metrics returns the following 
            lines in a DLCX response: 
             
                 XRM/LVM: PLC=1, JBA=2, JBR=7 ... 
                 XRM/RVM: PLC=0, JBA=0, JBR=3 ... 
             
            The parameters that may be reported in an XRM/LVM or XRM/RVM line fall 
            into the following categories: 
             
               - Parameters based on the VoIP metrics block [RFC 3611]. These are 
                 listed in Table 1. 
               - Parameters based on Sender Reports and Receiver Reports [RFC 
                 3550]. These are listed in Table 2. 
               - Parameters that describe the session. These are listed in Table 
                 3. Many of these are based on SDP parameters such as those 
                 specified in RFC 2327, RFC 2198, RFC 2733 etc. 
             
            Although Tables 1-3 include top-level definitions of these parameters, 
            some of their technical details may need to gleaned from the 
            references. For instance, the meaning of "standard" vs. "enhanced" 
            packet loss concealment must be obtained from [RFC 3611]. 
             
            Note that the rationale for allowing the reporting of parameters based  
            on RTCP Sender Reports and Receiver Reports (Table 2) in the XRM/LVM 
            and XRM/RVM lines is two-fold: 
             
               - The connection parameters line (the P: line) in the MGCP base 
                 protocol [RFC 3435] does not address remote metrics, 
               - The ABNF for packet loss in RFC 3435 is inconsistent with its RFC 
                 3550-based textual definition of packet loss.  
             
            Note that the latency metric in the connection parameters line (the P: 
            line) is not included in Table 2 since it is already included in the 
            RTCP XR VoIP metrics block as the round trip delay. RTCP XR [RFC 3611] 
            allows any method for its computation, including methods based on [RFC 
            3550]  or on the DLRR report block in [RFC 3611].

            2.3.1 Rules for the inclusion of XRM/LVM and XRM/RVM parameters 
             
            In general,  inclusion of a parameter from Tables 1-3 in the XRM/LVM or 
            XRM/RVM lines is subject to: 
             
               - The availability of the parameter. 
               - Local policy regarding its inclusion. 
             
            The following rules apply only to endpoints supporting this package: 
             
            DLCX/MDCX/AUCX rule for XRM/LVM: This rule applies to: (i) Endpoint 
            responses to call agent-initiated delete connection commands that are 
            targeted at a specific connection ID, (ii) Endpoint-initiated delete 
            connection commands, (iii) Endpoint responses to modify connection 
            commands that request session metrics via the XRM/MMO line, (iv) 
            Endpoint responses to audit connection commands that include "XRM/LVM" 
            in the RequestedInfo list. In each of these contexts, the XRM/LVM line 
            MUST be included by an endpoint supporting this package. Further, this 
            endpoint MUST compute at least one metric from the VoIP metrics block 
            (Table 1) and report it in the XRM/LVM line. All other parameters 
            (Tables 2 and 3) are completely optional. Their inclusion depends on 
            local policy. The endpoint MUST omit all parameters that are not 
            computed locally rather than include them with dummy values (e.g. 127 
            for the various MOS parameters). 
             
            DLCX/MDCX rule for XRM/RVM: This rule applies to: (i) Endpoint 
            responses to call agent-initiated delete connection commands that are 
            targeted at a specific connection ID, (ii) Endpoint-initiated delete 
            connection commands, (iii) Endpoint responses to modify connection 
            commands that request session metrics via the XRM/MMO line. In each of 
            these contexts, the XRM/RVM line MUST be included if the remote peer 
            sends VoIP metrics blocks [RFC 3611] in RTCP Extended Reports. If the 
            remote  device indicates that a particular VoIP metrics block parameter 
            is unavailable by sending a dummy value, then the dummy value MUST be 
            reported  or the parameter MUST be omitted from the XRM/RVM: line. For 
            example, the dummy value of 127, if used,  indicates that the signal 
            level, noise level, residual echo return loss, the various R factors 
            and MOS estimates are unavailable. If the VoIP metrics block is not 
            received from the remote device, the endpoint MAY omit the XRM/RVM line 
            even if it has non-VoIP metrics block parameters to report in the 
            XRM/RVM line, such as metrics communicated via RTCP Sender Reports (SR) 
            and Receiver Reports (RR). The endpoint MAY, of course, include the 
            XRM/RVM line with known non-VoIP metrics block parameters (Tables 2 and 
            3) when the VoIP metrics block is not communicated by the remote end. 
            If the remote device indicates that a particular Sender/Receiver Report 
            parameter is unavailable by assigning it a dummy value (such as an 
            inter-arrival jitter of 0), the endpoint MAY either omit it in the 
            XRM/RVM line or assign it a dummy value. 
             
            AUCX rule for XRM/RVM: This rule applies to endpoint responses to audit 
            connection commands that include "XRM/RVM" in the RequestedInfo list. 
            In this context, the XRM/RVM line MUST be included even if no VoIP 
            metrics blocks are received in RTCP extended reports from the remote 
            device. This line MAY, however, be empty if no data pertaining to RTCP

            XR VoIP metrics block (Table 1) is provided by the remote  device. 
            Alternately, the local endpoint MAY include other known remote 
            parameters  (Tables 2 and 3) in the XRM/RVM line. If the remote device 
            sends the VoIP metrics block in RTCP Extended Reports and indicates 
            that a particular parameter is unavailable by sending a dummy value, 
            then the dummy value MUST be reported  or the parameter MUST be omitted 
            from the XRM/RVM: line. If the remote device indicates that a 
            particular Sender/Receiver Report parameter is unavailable by assigning 
            it a dummy value (such as an inter-arrival jitter of 0), the endpoint 
            MAY either omit it in the XRM/RVM line or assign it a dummy value. 
             
            Rule for disallowed values: An endpoint receiving a disallowed value in 
            the VoIP metrics block MAY omit it in the XRM/RVM line. For example, 
            RFC 3611 does not allow a value of 60 in the 8-bit MOS-LQ field in the 
            VoIP metrics block. 
              
            2.3.2 XRM/LVM and XRM/RVM parameter values 
              
            Note that the metrics formats used by the call agent to store and 
            report metrics might be different from the formats used in this 
            package. For instance, the media gateway controller can convert the 
            binary   representation [RFC 3611] of network packet loss into a fixed-
            point percentage. Thus, an NLR value of 20 (Table 1) might be stored or 
            displayed as 7.81%. 
             
            The procedures for communicating voice quality metrics in the XRM/LVM 
            and XRM/RVM lines are invoked at the end of a call or at the end of a 
            call phase (such as when a call transfer is invoked). Therefore, the 
            metrics used in these lines are, except when otherwise noted, averages 
            from the start of metrics computation. The term "start of metrics 
            computation"  in Tables 1-3 SHALL be understood to mean: 
             
            - The start of the session if no metrics reset occurs. 
            - The last metrics reset, if there are any metrics resets. These 
            include resets commanded by the call agent or performed autonomously by 
            the endpoint. 
             
            It is recommended that the unstable or indeterminate periods at the 
            start and end of a call be factored out of metrics computation. The 
            duration of these guard bands is left to the implementation.

            2.3.3 Procedures for the resetting of metrics 
             
            In addition to responding to relevant XRM/MMO values, endpoints 
            supporting this package reset VQ metrics on media transitions such as a 
            transition from voice to voice band data. An event to report an 
            autonomous reset to the call agent with the set of metrics values prior 
            to the reset was considered unnecessary. This is because the 
            significant epoch of a call is generally following, not preceding, 
            media mode shifts such as a voice to voice band data transition. In 
            such cases, the preceding epochs are transient in nature and are not 
            associated with the transfer of the actual data.  
             
            Also, as a rule an SSRC change SHOULD NOT reset VQ metrics. This is 
            consistent with the base MGCP protocol [RFC 3435]. SSRC can occur due 
            to rare collision events [RFC 3550]. 
             
            The values assigned on reset to metrics and to related parameters are 
            described in the earlier section on ModifyConnection Procedures. 
             
            2.3.4 Impact redundancy and FEC on  packet loss computations 
             
            The packet loss and discard parameters based on the RTCP XR VoIP 
            metrics block [RFC 3611] are computed after taking redundancy and FEC 
            Kumar et al            Informational                Page 24 
            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             6/14/2005 
            into account. Thus, the following parameters from Table 1 SHALL be 
            computed after taking the effect of redundancy (e.g. RFC 2198) and/or 
            FEC (e.g. RFC 2733) into account: 
             
               - Network packet loss rate, NLR 
               - Jitter buffer discard rate, JDR 
               - Burst loss density, BLD, and burst duration, BD 
               - Gap loss density, GLD, and gap duration, GD 
             
            By contrast, the packet receipt and packet loss parameters based on 
            RTCP Sender Reports (SR) and Receiver Reports (RR) do not take 
            redundancy or FEC into account. They are meant to be indicative of 
            impairments "on the wire" than in end-to-end service. Thus, the packets 
            lost (PL) parameter in Table 2 does not take into account any loss 
            mitigation due to redundancy (e.g. RFC 2198) or FEC (e.g. RFC 2733) 
            into account.  
              
            2.3.5 Parameter Extension Mechanism 
             
            The XRM/LVM and XRM/RVM lines MAY include vendor extension parameters 
            that begin with an "X-". An MGCP entity that receives an extension 
            parameter in these lines MUST ignore it if it cannot understand it.  
             
            Since these parameters introduce an unmanaged name space, there is a 
            potential for name clashing. Vendors are consequently encouraged to 
            include some vendor specific string, e.g. vendor name or stock ticker 
            symbol, in their vendor extensions. For example, if Acme Widgets, a 
            fictional company, wishes to use metric "ABC", it is preferable to use 
            the name "X-acmewidgets-ABC" rather than  "X-ABC". 
             
            Vendors may register new metrics in an IANA registry of  MGCP names of 
            VoIP metrics. The "X-" prefix is not germane to a metric following 
            registration. 
             
            2.3.6 Grammar for VoIP metrics parameters 
             
            The following describes the ABNF encoding [RFC 2234] for the parameters 
            defined in this package. Per MGCP conventions,  all parameters defined 
            in this package are case-insensitive.  
             
            The standard tokens SP, WSP, ALPHA, DIGIT, HEXDIG etc. are per RFC 
            2234.  
             
            MediaMetricsOption = "XRM/MMO:" *WSP ("REP"/"RES"/"RR") 
             
            RemoteVoIPMetrics = "XRM/LVM:" *WSP [VoIPMetric *("," *WSP  
                                VoIPMetric)] 
                           ; zero or more local metrics 
                           ; zero metrics are permitted in AUCX responses 
             
            RemoteVoIPMetrics = "XRM/RVM:" *WSP [VoIPMetric *("," *WSP  
                                VoIPMetric)] 
                           ; zero or more remote metrics

            2.3.7 Applicability of VoIP metrics to Voice Band Data 
             
            For the definition of Voice Band Data, see [ITU V.152]. 
             
            RTCP is required in conjunction with any RTP session [RFC 3550]. 
            However, the various blocks in RTCP-XR, such as the VoIP metrics block, 
            are not. They must be negotiated at session establishment. 
             
            The parameters from the RTCP XR VoIP metrics block (Table 1) and the 
            RTCP Sender/Receiver Reports (Table 2) are applicable to Voice Band 
            Data. So are the session description parameters (Table 3). However, 
            note that the utility of the following parameters might be limited for 
            Voice Band Data: 
                
               - There is no correlation of the various MOS scores and R factors 
                 with the end-users' perspective of the quality of the data or fax 
                 transmission. Therefore, most implementations will send dummy MOS 
                 scores (a value of 127) and R-factors (a value of 127)in RTCP 
                 Extended Reports, omit them in the XRM/LVM line and either omit 
                 them or assign them dummy values in the XRM/RVM line. Some 
                 implementations may elect to use the MOS scores and R factors as 
                 approximate (albeit poor) indicators of the degree of channel 
                 impairment. 
             
               - For some Voice Band Data sessions, echo cancellation is turned 
                 off. For others, it is turned on. If echo cancellation is off, 
                 then RERL reverts to the Echo Return Loss of the hybrid 
                 transformer or acoustic coupling path. However, some 
                 implementations might not measure this parameter in the absence 
                 of an active echo canceller. In such cases, this parameter will 
                 be omitted in the XRM/LVM and XRM/RVM lines, or set to a dummy 
                 value (127) in the XRM/RVM line. 
             
               - Many voice band data sessions [ITU V.152] use fixed-length jitter 
                 buffers. If this is the case, then this will be reflected in the 
                 JBA parameter (set to "non-adaptive"), the JBR parameter (set to 
                 0) and the JBS parameter (set to JBM).   
             
            3. Call Flow Examples 
             
            The following examples are partial call flows for the case where the 
            XRM/mcr local connection option is set to "on". Only one endpoint's 
            perspective is shown. In this example, the remote endpoint sends voice 
            metrics to this endpoint via RTCP Extended Reports, Sender Reports and 
            Receiver Reports. 
             
            Note that these are call flow examples and not examples of typical 
            metrics values. These values have not been derived from real-world 
            situations and, therefore, do not necessarily have the right numeric 
            relationship between themselves.

            Step 1: 
            The Call Agent issues a CreateConnection command to the endpoint 
            instructing it to use PCMU media encoding and to invoke RTCP XR metric 
            collection, responding and reporting:

            Step 2: 
             
            The endpoint acknowledges the command and includes the rtxp-xr 
            attribute set to "voip-metrics":

            Step 3: 
             
            The endpoint receives a ModifyConnection command containing an LCO with 
            no xrm/mcr parameter, which indicates that the endpoint should continue 
            to use the previously received value of "on". Since the received SDP 
            also contains the rtcp-xr attribute with a value of "voip-metrics", it 
            is safe to assume that both ends will exchange the VoIP metrics block 
            in RTCP Extended Reports (XR).

            Step 4: 
             
            The endpoint acknowledges the command and, since VoIP metrics 
            collection/reporting is still "on", includes the rtxp-xr attribute set 
            to "voip-metrics":

            The Call Agent eventually issues a DeleteConnection:

            Step 6: 
             
            The endpoint acknowledges the command and returns the standard MGCP 
            connection parameters along with the XRM/LVM line and the XRM/RVM line. 
            This endpoint elects to include the remote equivalents of the 
            connection parameters on XRM/RVM line. Note that the remote end has 
            indicated that the ITU G.107 specification has been used to compute the 
            R-factors and that a proprietary algorithm, "Acme Widgets 233", has 
            been used to compute MOS-LQ. The remote end has not indicated the 
            algorithm used to compute MOS-CQ, which is on of the metrics that it 
            has communicated via an RTCP extended report. Also note that new lines 
            shown here are for document formatting reasons only.

            The endpoint receives a ModifyConnection command containing an LCO with 
            no xrm/mcr parameter, which indicates that the endpoint should continue 
            to use the previously received value of "on". Since the received SDP 
            also contains the rtcp-xr attribute with a value of "voip-metrics", it 
            is safe to assume that both ends will exchange the VoIP metrics block 
            in RTCP Extended Reports (XR).

            The Call Agent issues a CreateConnection command to the endpoint

            4. Security Considerations 
             
            This package inherits the security considerations of the base MGCP 
            protocol.  A possible new security issue involves a remote  device 
            placing extra burden on a local endpoint by requesting metric 
            collection on that local endpoint.  This threat can be mitigated by the 
            call agent specifically prohibiting the generation of local metrics 
            using the local connection option: xrm/mcr: off. 
             
            5. IANA Considerations 
             
            5.1 Package Registration 
             
            The IANA is hereby requested to register the following MGCP package: 
                
              Package Title         Name     Version   
              -------------         ----     -------     
              RTCP XR metrics       XRM        0 
             
            5.2. Extension Registration 
             
            The IANA is requested to create a registry of MGCP names of vendor-
            specified VoIP metrics.  These metrics MAY be used in the XRM/LVM and 
            XRM/RVM lines defined in this package. Such a metric SHALL be described 
            in a specification ("source document") approved by an accredited 
            standards  organization such as the IETF or ITU.  This document MAY be 
            informative and MAY address more than one metric. It MUST include: 
             
            - Contact name, email address and telephone number. 
            - Metric name, as an alphabetic character string 
            - Description of and ABNF notation for the permitted  
                 range of values,  
            - A functional description of the metric i.e. what it  
                 measures and how it is to be used, 
            - Optionally, the measurement algorithm and any IPR statements 
                 associated with it.

            6. Changes from earlier drafts 
             
            6.1 Changes from the -00 version to the -01 version 
             
            Most changes from the -00 version to the -01 version of this draft are 
            backwards compatible, with the exception described below. 
             
            6.1.1 Changes that are not backwards compatible 
             
            There are two naming inconsistencies in the -00 draft between the table 
            of metrics and the ABNF.  In the table of metrics, the R-factor and the 
            external R-factor were named NSR and XSR, while in the ABNF they were 
            named RF and XRF. There is no way to rectify this in a backwards 
            compatible manner. We changed these names in the -01 draft to "RCQ" for 
            the R-factor and "XRCQ" so as to not favor either of the earlier names. 
              
            6.1.2 Changes that are backwards compatible 
              
            All new features in this package are optional. 
             
            The following changes from the -00 version of this draft to the -01 
            version are backwards compatible: 
             
            - Inclusion of statistics from the RTCP sender and receiver reports, 
            with the exception of latency which is already present in the RTCP XR 
            VoIP metrics block. The reporting of these statistics via this package 
            is optional. 
             
            - Inclusion of session description parameters based on the ones defined 
            in RFC 2327, RFC 2198 etc. This included media description parameters 
            such as codec type.  
             
            - Inclusion of a modify connection procedure for the reporting and 
            resetting of voice quality metrics. 
             
            - Clarification of whether an XR or SR/RR metrics is a running 
            average/cumulative value or the last computed value. For the SR/RR 
            metrics, these rules are inherited from connection parameters in [RFC 
            3435]. 
             
            - Inclusion of a new G.107-based parameter, RLQ, for indicating the 
            listening quality of a VoIP session. 
             
            - Clarification of the use of a negative sign in conjunction with the 
            noise level (NL) and residual echo return loss (RERL). 
             
            - Inclusion of a new parameter, MLES, for indicating the algorithm used
