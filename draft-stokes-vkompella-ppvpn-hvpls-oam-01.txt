       Abstract 
        
       This document describes a methodology for testing the 
       operation, administration and maintenance (OA&M) of a general 
       VPN service, that is applied here to Hierarchical Virtual 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 1 
       Private LAN Services (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS].  As part 
       of this methodology, the MPLS ping concepts described in [LSP-
       PING] are extended to enable HVPLS spoke-to-spoke connectivity 
       testing.  A method to provide the information necessary for 
       this spoke-to-spoke OA&M is also proposed.   
        
       These are the goals of this draft: 
               -   checking connectivity between "service-aware" 
                   nodes of a network, 
               -   verifying data plane and control plane integrity, 
               -   verifying service membership 
        
       There are two specific requirements to which we call attention 
       because of their seemingly contradictory nature: 
               -   the checking of connectivity MUST involve the 
                   ability to use packets that look like customer 
                   packets 
               -   the OAM packets MUST not propagate beyond the 
                   boundary of the provider network

       PPVPN  
            
       3.3 WHY IS IT TARGETTED AT THIS WG  
            
       The charter of the PPVPN WG includes L2 VPN services and this 
       draft specifies a method for testing Ethernet VPLS services 
       over MPLS.  
            
       3.4 JUSTIFICATION  
            
       There is no Internet document that fully provides a method for 
       testing a Hierarchical VPLS. 
        
       4 Changes since last revision 
        
               -   incorporated changes to [LSP-PING] 
               -   selected method to detect OAM packets (special 
                   label) 
               -   added IPR notices and Full Copyright statement 
                   (per 2026) 
        
       5 Overview 
        
       This document describes a methodology for the operation, 
       administration and maintenance (OA&M) of a Hierarchical VPLS 
       (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS].  Service providers wanting to 
       deploy such a VPLS need to be able to test its operation 
       across the entire hierarchy of the VPLS.  While today's 
       standards are able to test parts of an HVPLS, there are some 
       aspects that cannot be tested. 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 4 
        
       This OA&M methodology requires extensions to the MPLS ping 
       concepts described in [LSP-PING] to enable VPLS spoke-to-spoke 
       connectivity testing.  It also requires extensions to the 
       HVPLS concepts in [VPLS].  
        
       We define the following four functions that are needed to 
       provide OA&M for services: 
        
               -   connectivity verification 
               -   service verification 
               -   topology discovery 
               -   performance monitoring 
        
       5.1 Connectivity verification 
        
       There are five logical steps to verifying the operation of an 
       HVPLS: 
        
               -   verify that all HVPLS nodes are operational 
               -   verify that all HVPLS peer sessions are 
                   operational 
               -   verify that all HVPLS tunnel LSPs are transporting 
                   data packets correctly 
               -   verify that data packets can be exchanged between 
                   any two spokes in the HVPLS 
               -   verify that actual customer devices can 
                   communicate with devices at any site 
           
       Existing tests can verify the first three steps.  This 
       document describes how to address the final two issues. 
        
       5.2 Service Verification 
        
       Service verification has to do with whether the service aware 
       nodes have been consistently configured for the service or 
       not.  These extensions will be described in a later version. 
        
       5.3 Topology Discovery 
        
       Topology discovery has to do with the current layout of a VPN 
       service, e.g., the PEs and MTUs participating in a VPLS.  
       These extensions will be described in Section 9.

       5.4 Performance Monitoring 
        
       Performance monitoring, such as determining round-trip times, 
       jitter, average packet throughput, etc. will be described in a 
       future version. 
        
       6 Terminology 
        
       The following terms are used in this text: 
        
               -   Service point: a provider device that has 
                   knowledge of the service.  We note here that the 
                   transport tunnel, while an integral part of the 
                   service, only serves to carry the service.  In 
                   contrast, service-aware nodes participate in the 
                   signaling and maintenance of the VPN service. 
               -   Service ping: a protocol for testing end-to-end 
                   connectivity through the data plane 
               -   Service traceroute: a protocol for identifying 
                   intermediate nodes in an end-to-end service 
               -   OA&M FEC: a forwarding equivalence class for the 
                   purpose of identifying and forwarding OA&M packets 
        
       7 Structural Model 
        
       We describe below the structural model that implements OA&M 
       for VPN services.  The encapsulation and traversal methodology 
       is described.  We note that while it is not possible to make 
       an OA&M packet look indistinguishable from customer frames, a 
       reasonable verisimilitude may be maintained.  This allows the 
       lookup methods and encapsulation used in the data plane to be 
       preserved. 
        
       7.1 Identification 
        
       We use loopback or "always on" IP addresses to identify the 
       service points.  This allows service points to address each 
       other, which is especially important in case of last ditch 
       error reporting. 
        
       7.2 Addressing 
        
       We require the addressing in the OA&M packets to be 
       configurable to match a customer VPN address, whether a MAC 
       address, DLCI, private IP address, etc.  While addresses in 
       the service provider network MAY be usable, they may not have 



      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 6 
       relevance in proving that customer packets can traverse the 
       service domain. 
        
       7.3 FIB Traversal 
        
       We require that OA&M packets following the data plane traverse 
       the service points using the forwarding lookup tables just as 
       customer packets are. 
        
       7.4 Intermediate Failure Processing 
        
       Failures at intermediate service points should be reported 
       back using the control plane.  This provides the basis for a 
       traceroute function. 
        
       7.5 Control and Data Plane 
        
       Typically, connectivity should first be checked against the 
       data plane.  If the request packet makes it to the destination 
       service point, the reply packet should be sent along the data 
       plane.  Otherwise, after some interval, the sender should send 
       another packet along the data plane, requesting a reply back 
       on the control plane.  If this fails, a final attempt may be 
       made, with the request sent along the control plane, and the 
       reply back along the control plane.  If this fails, then the 
       network is probably partitioned. 
        
       8 OA&M Functions 
           
       The OA&M functions described below have specific reference to 
       a particular VPN service, i.e., HVPLS.  A later revision will 
       deal with general VPN service OA&M. 
           
       8.1 VPLS ping 
        
       There are two parts to connectivity verification.  The first 
       is ensuring that a particular remote service point is 
       reachable.  The second is diagnosing failures in case the said 
       service point is not reachable. 
        
       The primary goal of connectivity verification is to check the 
       data plane consistency.  This requires intermediate service 
       points to forward OAM messages using FIB lookups, next hop 
       table matches, etc., just as they would for a conventional 
       customer packet.  We call this the VPLS (service) ping 
       function. 
        


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 7 
       A secondary goal of connectivity verification is to provide 
       information of the service points in the service.  We call 
       this the VPLS (service) traceroute function. 
        
       In addition, it is good to have the ability to send replies 
       through the control plane, so as to allow for error reporting 
       when all else fails. 
        
       Verifying that data packets can be exchanged between any two 
       spokes in the HVPLS detects problems with the "bridging" 
       aspects of the HVPLS.  Doing a complete test requires each 
       spoke node to verify that it can exchange packets with every 
       other spoke node in the HVPLS.  This requires that each spoke 
       node know the MAC addresses of all of the other spokes.  Using 
       this information, a spoke can encapsulate a MPLS ping frame 
       using the same label stack as normal customer data, and then 
       send the packet to a remote peer.  When the packet is un-
       encapsulated at the remote end, the L2 destination MAC address 
       will be that of the remote spoke and the IP address will be in 
       the range 127/8 [LSP-PING]. 
        
       Such a VPLS ping requires defining a new Target FEC Stack Sub-
       Type in [LSP-PING].  This type is defined as a "Hierarchical 
       L2 circuit."  The complete list of Target FEC Sub-Types is 
       shown below. 
        
       Sub-Type #       Length        Value Field 
       ----------       ------        ----------- 
                1            5        LDP IPv4 prefix 
                2           17        LDP IPv6 prefix 
                3           20        RSVP IPv4 Session Query 
                4           56        RSVP IPv6 Session Query 
                5                     Reserved 
                6           13        VPN IPv4 prefix 
                7           25        VPN IPv6 prefix 
                8           14        L2 VPN endpoint 
                9           10        L2 circuit ID 
               10     variable        Hierarchical L2 circuit ID 
        
       New Layer 2 specific Sub-TLVs to be used with a Hierarchical 
       L2 Circuit FEC Stack Sub-Type are also required.  A new reply 
       mode is also needed to specify if the reply should use the 
       HVPLS, i.e., the data plane.  
        
       For security purposes, a service point receiving a VPLS ping 
       SHOULD check the sender information to ensure that the sender 




      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 8 
       is known to be in the HVPLS.  See Section 12 for further 
       discussion.

       The VC ID is the same as contained in the VC FEC TLV in

       The "L2 specific Sub-TLVs" use the same Type field as defined

       Type 
          The field MUST be set to a value of 0x000B. 
        
       Length 
          This field specifies the total length of the Value fields 
          in octets. 
        
       Target Ethernet MAC address 
          This field specifies the target Ethernet MAC of the remote 
          spoke or customer device.  It is included here to assist 
          implementations when processing echo replies and VPLS 
          traceroute as discussed in Section 8. 
        
       Sender Ethernet MAC address 
          This field specifies the sender's Ethernet MAC that can be 
          used in a reply. 
        
       802.1Q Tag  
          These fields specify the 802.1Q Tag associated with the 
          Target and Sender Ethernet MACs described above.  If the 
          Ethernet VLAN encapsulation is used, the values MUST be 
          zero.  If the Ethernet encapsulation is used, and the 
          Ethernet address is associated with a VLAN, it MUST be set 
          to the VLAN tag.  If the Ethernet encapsulation is used, 
          and the MAC address is not associated with a VLAN (untagged 
          VLAN), it MUST be set to zero.  Since an 802.1Q tag is 12-
          bits, the high 4 bits of the fields MUST be set to zero. 
        
       8.1.3  Reply mode 
        
       [LSP-PING] defines multiple reply modes for MPLS pings.  For 
       example, reply mode Value 2, "Reply via an IPv4 UDP packet" 
       allows the reply to be sent via an MPLS LSP but does not 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 10 
       require it.  The reply can be sent as an IP packet.  Value 3, 
       "Reply via an IPv4 UDP packet with Router Alert," requires 
       that the reply be sent as an IP packet. 
        
       For a VPLS ping, an additional reply mode is required.  Since 
       a VPLS implies bidirectional operation, a reply mode is 
       required that specifies that the reply packet be sent using 
       the VPLS.  Therefore, Value 5, "Reply via a VPLS IPv4 UDP 
       packet," is proposed.  The complete list of reply modes is 
       show below. 
        
       Value    Meaning 
       -----    ------- 
           1    Do not reply 
           2    Reply via an IPv4 UDP packet 
           3    Reply via an IPv4 UDP packet with Router Alert 
           4    Reply via the control plane 
           5    Reply via a VPLS IPv4 UDP packet  
          
        
       This provides for three different reply methods to help in 
       failure detection.  If the ping is successful using reply mode 
       Value 2, but not successful using reply mode Value 5, this 
       indicates that the ping is reaching the remote peer but there 
       is a problem with the VPLS return path. 
        
       8.1.4  VPLS ping encapsulation 
        
       It is desirable for both operational and security reasons to 
       be able to easily recognize in the data plane that a received 
       packet is a VPLS ping.  Therefore, when a VPLS ping is 
       encapsulated, a special label is added below the VC FEC label. 
        
       This method confines the checking for an OAM packet to the 
       MPLS label stack.  Since the bottom-of-stack bit SHOULD be 
       checked on every VC label, regular customer packets will not 
       take a hit.  But when the bottom-of-stack bit is off, either 
       something has gone wrong or the packet is an OAM packet.  Both 
       cases can be handled on a slow path by the control plane. 
        
       It is proposed that the special label added be the Router 
       Alert Label (value of 1) as defined in [LABEL-ENC].  It should 
       be noted that this requires special handling of the Router 
       Alert Label, as it is not normally present at the bottom of 
       the label stack. 
        




      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 11 
       Note that this approach affects how the data plane is checked 
       in load sharing cases where the label stack is used in the 
       load sharing hashing algorithm (see Section 11 for more 
       details).   
        
       At an egress node, when a VPLS ping packet is detected, the 
       packet SHOULD be passed to the node's control plane.  If it 
       cannot be passed to the control plane, the packet SHOULD be 
       discarded.  The packet MUST NOT be forwarded to the customer 
       network.  Note that the rate at which packets are passed to 
       the control plane should be regulated to prevent overloading.   
        
       8.1.5  Egress node control plane processing 
        
       When an egress node control plane receives a VPLS ping packet, 
       it checks the Target Ethernet MAC address field to determine 
       if it is a MAC address belonging to that node.  If it is, a 
       successful reply is returned.  If the MAC address does not 
       belong to that node, an additional check is made of the 
       forwarding database associated with the HVPLS indicated by the 
       VC ID field.  If the MAC is present and is associated with a 
       locally attached customer network for this HVPLS, a successful 
       reply is returned.  If not, an unsuccessful reply is returned.   
        
       This requires new MPLS ping Return Code information.  To avoid 
       defining codes that are specific to HVPLS, an encoding of the 
       Error Code TLV is proposed.  This encoding is shown in Section 
       8.1.6.   
        
       Note that this method of operation allows VPLS ping to check 
       for both remote node MACs and remote customer device MACs. 
        
       When a VPLS ping target MAC address is unknown in a core node, 
       the VPLS ping packet is flooded.  As such, it potentially 
       reaches other nodes in addition to the spoke where the 
       destination is actually present.  As a result, the sending 
       node may receive replies from multiple remote nodes.  This 
       allows an operator to determine which remote nodes would 
       receive a flood of an actual customer data packet destined to 
       the target MAC address. 
        
       8.1.6  Error Code TLV 
        
       The proposed Error Code TLV for use with [LSP-PING] is shown 
       below.

          The proposed encoding for these Sub-TLVs is shown below.

                the request 
        
       The Value 5 shown above is explained in Section 8.2.4. 
           
       8.2 VPLS traceroute 
        
       When a VPLS ping using reply mode 5 (Reply via a VPLS IPv4 UDP 
       packet) is unsuccessful, additional capabilities are required 
       to identify the problem location.  A VPLS traceroute is 
       therefore proposed.  
        
       8.2.1  HVPLS operational requirements 
        
       To provide an HVPLS traceroute capability, the basic operation 
       of an HVPLS needs further definition.  In particular, the 
       handling of the TTL field in VC FEC labels needs to be 
       defined.  This TTL handling is also dependent on VC FEC 
       parameters specified when a spoke signals to a core node. 
        
       8.2.2  VC FEC label TTL processing 
        
       A data packet normally goes from a HVPLS spoke node to a HVPLS 
       core node.  In the core HVPLS node, the VC FEC label received 
       from the spoke node is used to determine the HVPLS with which 
       the encapsulated frame is associated.  The frame is un-
       encapsulated and a check is made for the frame's destination 
       MAC address.  If the destination MAC is known, the frame is 
       forwarded to the core peer from which the MAC was learned 
       [VPLS].  As the frame is forwarded, the frame is again 
       encapsulated using the VC FEC label received from the peer 
       core node. 
        


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 14 
       A similar process occurs at the remote core peer.  The VC FEC 
       label is checked, the frame is un-encapsulated, the 
       destination MAC is checked, the frame is again encapsulated 
       and sent to the remote spoke node.  The packet containing the 
       newly encapsulated frame uses the VC FEC label received from 
       the destination spoke node.  
        
       Each time that this process occurs, the received VC FEC label 
       TTL value SHOULD be decremented and the result placed in the 
       outgoing VC FEC label TTL field.  If the resulting value is 0, 
       the packet SHOULD be passed to the node's control plane.  If 
       it cannot be passed to the control plane, the packet SHOULD be 
       discarded.  Note that the rate at which packets are passed to 
       the control plane should be regulated to prevent overloading.   
        
       If the destination MAC is not known and the packet is flooded 
       to multiple peer nodes or multiple spoke nodes, the same TTL 
       described above is placed in each VC FEC label. 
        
       In normal operation, the TTL value in the VC FEC label should 
       be set to a value larger than the number of "HVPLS Hops" 
       through which the data packet will pass, e.g., 255.   
        
       Note that this mode of operation also provides some protection 
       against the effects of loops at the HVPLS level. 
        
       8.2.3  HVPLS spoke node considerations 
        
       [VPLS] permits spoke nodes to specify Ethernet or Ethernet 
       VLAN when signaling a VC FEC to a core node.  This permits 
       [PWE3-CTRL] spokes to attach to an HVPLS.  These spoke nodes 
       will normally set a value of 2 for the VC FEC label TTL as 
       specified in [PWE3-ENET].  With the TTL processing described 
       in Section 8.2.2, this will cause packets to be erroneously 
       discarded inside a HVPLS.  Therefore, we require a change in 
       the TTL setting at spoke nodes to be 255 by default. 
        
       As further discussed in Section 12, security considerations 
       also require a change to detect OAM packets. 
        
       8.2.4  VPLS traceroute format 
        
       A VPLS traceroute uses the same echo request packet described 
       in Section 8.1 for a VPLS ping.  The echo request packet 
       SHOULD contain one or more Downstream Mapping TLVs [LSP-PING].   
        




      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 15 
       In this case the Downstream Router ID field contains the IPv4 
       address of the next HVPLS node that would be used to reach the 
       Target Ethernet MAC in the HVPLS indicated in the Hierarchical 
       L2 Circuit FEC Stack Sub-Type.  The Downstream Label field 
       contains the VC FEC label from the targeted LDP session with 
       the downstream peer.  The Protocol field indicates a value of 
       3 for (targeted) LDP. 
        
       When the indicated Target Ethernet MAC is not known and a 
       packet with this destination MAC would be flooded, the 
       information for all HVPLS peers to which the packet would be 
       flooded is added.  For the case where the packet would not be 
       flooded (such as a limit on MAC addresses that has been 
       exceeded for this HVPLS), a new MPLS ping Return code is 
       defined.  This new Value 5 is shown in Section 8.1.6.   
        
       8.2.5  VPLS traceroute procedures 
        
       To create a traceroute, an echo request is created using the 
       destination Ethernet MAC address of the remote spoke or 
       customer device.  The TTL in the VC FEC label is set 
       successively to 1, 2, 3, ...   
        
       As with MPLS traceroute, the echo request SHOULD contain one 
       or more Downstream Mapping TLVs.  For TTL=1, all the peer 
       nodes (and corresponding VC FEC labels) for the sender with 
       respect to the remote spoke being pinged SHOULD be sent in the 
       echo request.  For n>1, the Downstream Mapping TLVs from the 
       echo reply for TTL=(n-1) are copied to the echo request with 
       TTL=n. 
        
       As the packet exits a tunnel LSP, the node first checks if the 
       destination MAC address is a MAC belonging to this node.  If 
       so, the packet is passed to the node∆s control plane and an 
       echo reply is created as described in [LSP-PING].  This 
       includes completing the Downstream Mapping TLV as described in 
       Section 8.2.4.  The reply is sent based on the value indicated 
       in the Reply Mode field of the echo request. 
        
       If the MAC is not for this node, it then checks the TTL value 
       of the VC FEC label.  If the value is 1, the packet is passed 
       to the node's control plane and an echo reply is created as 
       described in [LSP-PING] and Section 8.1.  Note that the 
       control plane also checks its forwarding database associated 
       with this HVPLS to see if the target MAC is associated with a 
       locally attached customer network.  The reply is sent based on 




      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 16 
       the value indicated in the Reply Mode field of the echo 
       request.   
        
       For security purposes, before replying to a VPLS traceroute, a 
       node SHOULD check the sender information to ensure that the 
       sender is known to be in the specified HVPLS.  See Section 12 
       for further discussion. 
        
       If the value of the VC FEC label TTL is greater than 1, the 
       TTL is decremented and the result is placed in the VC FEC 
       label TTL for the resulting packet.  This packet is 
       encapsulated in the same manner as a customer data packet and 
       then passed to the downstream node that would normally be used 
       to reach the indicated Ethernet MAC.  If the packet is flooded 
       to multiple peer nodes, this same TTL value is placed in the 
       VC FEC label TTL of each of the packets. 
        
       9 Distribution of VPLS node information 
        
       A spoke node normally knows the IP address of the core node 
       with which it peers.  It typically does not know the IP 
       addresses or MAC addresses of the other spokes in the network.  
       In order to perform the MPLS ping described in Section 8.1, a 
       spoke must know the MAC addresses of the other spokes.  This 
       information could be distributed via the targeted LDP sessions 
       between HVPLS nodes. 
        
       [VPLS] defines a MAC TLV that can be used with a LDP Address 
       Withdrawal Message [MPLS-LDP].  In a similar manner, a LDP 
       Address Message [MPLS-LDP] can be used to distribute the 
       required information about HVPLS nodes. 
        
       9.1 Ethernet VPLS node TLV  
        
       To distribute HVPLS node information, a new TLV is proposed 
       for use with a LDP Address Message.  This new Ethernet VPLS 
       node TLV is shown below.  Note that the node∆s IP address is 
       included to allow remote nodes to correlate the node∆s MAC 
       address with its IP address.  In this manner an operator can 
       request a VPLS ping by specifying the IP address of the remote 
       spoke.

       The scope of the Ethernet VPLS node TLV is the VPLS specified 
       in the FEC TLV in the Address Message. 
        
       9.2 Ethernet VPLS node procedures 
        
       When a spoke and a core node establish a new peer relationship 
       for an HVPLS, they exchange one or more Address Messages with 
       the above information.  The spoke node sends information about 
       a single HVPLS node (itself). The IP address should be the 
       address by which the node is known to its peers.  The MAC 
       address should be a MAC address of the switch such that an un-
       encapsulated frame received from an HVPLS peer with this 
       destination MAC address will be delivered to the node's 
       control plane.  
        
       When two core nodes establish a peer relationship, they also 
       exchange one or more Address Messages with the above 
       information.  In this case each core sends the MAC address 
       information for all of the spokes to which it is connected, as 
       well as for itself. 
        
       Returning to the case of a core establishing a peer connection 
       with a spoke, the core node sends to the spoke all of the MAC 
       addresses that it has learned from all of its core peers (as 
       well as for itself).  In this manner, each spoke will know the 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 18 
       MAC addresses of all of the other spokes in the HVPLS.  Note 
       that in large networks multiple Address Messages may be 
       required to ensure that media MTU sizes limitations are not 
       exceeded. 
        
       When a core node loses the connection to a spoke, it instructs 
       all of its core peers to remove the corresponding spoke MAC 
       address by sending the above information in a Address 
       Withdrawal Message [MPLS-LDP].  The core nodes in turn pass 
       that information along in Address Withdrawal Messages to their 
       spokes. 
        
       When a core node loses the connection to another core node, it 
       instructs all of its spoke nodes to remove all of the 
       corresponding MAC addresses by sending the above information 
       in an Address Withdrawal Message. 
        
       Using the above capabilities, a spoke node can test the data 
       plane operation between itself and any other spoke site in the 
       HVPLS. 
        
       9.3 Operation of limited HVPLS nodes 
        
       There may be some implementations that do not want to maintain 
       a list of remote spoke IP and MAC addresses.  In such an 
       environment, an operator can still invoke a VPLS ping or VPLS 
       traceroute if the MAC address of the remote spoke or customer 
       device is provided.   
        
       There may be some cases where an operator knows the IP address 
       of a remote spoke, but not the MAC address.  A method to 
       obtain the MAC address when only the IP address is known may 
       be described in a future version. 
           
       10 General VPLS testing procedures 
        
       When operating in a background mode, the checks listed in 
       Section 5.1 are normally performed on different time scales.  
       Testing HVPLS nodes and peer sessions requires minimal network 
       impact since this is done on a per machine and a per peer 
       basis.  Also, monitoring for these failures can be done with 
       SNMP traps.  It is important to note that these tests are 
       expected to catch a significant percentage of the most likely 
       failures.  
        
       Tunnel LSPs are maintained by their associated MPLS signaling 
       protocols, RSVP-TE [MPLS-RSVP] or LDP.  Locally detected 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 19 
       failures such as link outages or node failures invoke MPLS 
       recovery actions.  These actions can include local recovery as 
       in the case of [RSVP-FRR].  In the case of a successful local 
       recovery of a tunnel LSP, the HVPLS nodes need not be 
       notified.  If a local recovery is not possible, then RSVP-TE 
       or LDP notifies the HVPLS node using the tunnel LSP of the 
       failure.  This in turn can generate a SNMP trap or an operator 
       error message. 
        
       In addition to failures and changes detected outside of MPLS, 
       both MPLS signaling protocols have control plane failure 
       detection mechanisms.  Both have Hello protocols that can 
       detect link failures as well as MPLS control plane failures.  
       LDP also has a Keep Alive protocol.  These Hello and Keep 
       Alive protocols run on the time frame of multiple seconds.  
       They also provide failure notification to the HVPLS node using 
       the tunnel.  As above, this can generate a SNMP trap or an 
       operator error message. 
        
       In current [PWE3-CTRL] or [VPLS] environments, loss of a 
       targeted LDP session to a peer is normally the key operator 
       notification.  While a failed tunnel LSP can generate a 
       notification as described above, these failures can be 
       temporary in nature due to routing transients.  
        
       MPLS ping is designed to catch failures where the control 
       plane believes that a tunnel LSP is operational but it is in 
       fact not functioning correctly.  This corrupted LSP is much 
       less likely to occur than a LSP going down "properly."  When 
       used as a background check, it should be used in addition to 
       the above tunnel LSP failure detection methods and not as a 
       replacement. 
        
       When any of these methods detects a tunnel LSP failure, the 
       HVPLS node can switch to another LSP if one is available.  
       When the failure is detected by MPLS ping, MPLS traceroute can 
       be used to assist in failure isolation.  
        
       VPLS ping is designed to detect problems in the "bridging" 
       aspects of the VPLS operation.  It detects flooding and/or MAC 
       learning problems in the network which are not checked in the 
       above tests.  Note that the number of possible spoke-to-spoke 
       tests to check an entire HVPLS can be significant.  Therefore, 
       care should be taken when executing VPLS ping as a background 
       test to avoid overloading the network or the HVPLS nodes.  
       Note also that an individual core node's operation is checked 
       by multiple spoke-to-spoke checks. 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 20 
        
       When a failure is detected by VPLS ping, VPLS traceroute can 
       be used to assist in problem isolation. 
        
       All of the above tests check the operation of a HVPLS to the 
       edge of the HVPLS.  It is also possible to use VPLS ping and 
       traceroute to check for customer device MAC addresses.  While 
       not specified by HVPLS, there is normally additional 
       information available to an operator to check for problems 
       between the edge of the HVPLS and the customer.  These 
       include: 
        
               -   the state of the local customer VLAN or port - 
                   this is the simplest test and will normally catch 
                   the most likely failures 
               -   the L2 MAC entries for the local customer VLAN or 
                   port 
               -   the HVPLS transmit/receive statistics 
        
       As described above, VPLS ping and VPLS traceroute work with 
       previously defined MPLS tests to provide an end-to-end test 
       capability for an HVPLS.  In addition, extensions to [VPLS] 
       allow VPLS ping to operate in a background mode with knowledge 
       of the remote sites that need to be checked.   
        
       11 Load sharing considerations 
        
       Some implementations provide for load sharing a tunnel LSP 
       across multiple LSPs.  Such implementations have HVPLS test 
       implications.   
        
       When customer data entering a VPLS at an ingress node is 
       transmitted to another node over multiple (load sharing) 
       tunnel LSPs, each of these LSPs SHOULD be tested.  VPLS pings 
       and traceroutes SHOULD be sent over each of these LSPs. 
        
       There may also be multiple load sharing tunnel LSPs between a 
       core node which is not the traffic ingress and a downstream 
       node (which may or may not be the traffic egress).  At such a 
       core node, a decision is made as to which load sharing tunnel 
       LSP to use to forward a HVPLS packet.  This decision is often 
       based on a hash of some "random" field.  There are at least 
       two options.  One option is to hash on the label stack of the 
       received HVPLS packet.  This forces all packets received on a 
       tunnel LSP for the same HVPLS to use the same load sharing 
       tunnel LSP to the next core node.  This method distributes 
       traffic among the load sharing tunnel LSPs on a HVPLS basis. 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 21 
        
       A second option is to hash on fields of the HVPLS packet after 
       it has been un-encapsulated (see Section 8.1.5).  Such a hash 
       could use the destination and source MAC addresses of the un-
       encapsulated packet. Thus, traffic received on a tunnel LSP 
       for the same HVPLS may use any of the load sharing tunnel LSPs 
       to the next core node.  This method distributes traffic among 
       the load sharing tunnel LSPs on a MAC address pair basis.  
        
       The second option normally produces a more optimal 
       distribution of packets since MAC addresses should be more 
       random than HVPLS labels.  This advantage may be somewhat 
       reduced if customers use a single router at each site to 
       connect to the HVPLS. 
        
       The first option has an advantage from an HVPLS testing 
       perspective. Since the label stack for a VPLS ping or 
       traceroute is the same as for customer traffic, the first 
       option ensures that VPLS pings and traceroutes are testing all 
       of the LSPs used by customer data.  Remember from above that 
       VPLS pings and traceroutes SHOULD be sent using all of the 
       load sharing tunnel LSPs at the ingress node. 
        
       Please note that a special use of the Router Alert label is 
       specified in Section 8.1.4 and that this label SHOULD NOT be 
       included in any hash algorithm based on the label stack.  
        
       Load sharing designs and hash algorithms remain implementation 
       options. There are trade-offs between optimal load sharing and 
       testability.  Of course, testing using IP ping and traceroute 
       has similar exposures from the effects of equal cost 
       multipath. 
        
       12 Security Considerations 
        
       For security purposes, the edge of a provider's HVPLS network 
       is defined to be a spoke node or a PE that has directly 
       attached customers.  Some customers and providers may desire 
       that the provider edge node participate in the customer 
       network.  This could be the case when the customer is using 
       the provider's node as a default gateway.  In such a 
       configuration, the provider edge node's IP address and 
       Ethernet MAC address are known in the customer network.  
       However, no other provider network information should be 
       exposed to the customer network.  When the provider is not 
       furnishing a default gateway function, no provider network 
       information should be exposed to the customer network. 


      draft-stokes-vkompella-ppvpn-hvpls-oam-01.txt  Dec 2002 Page 22 
        
       The VPLS ping and VPLS traceroute capabilities described in 
       Sections 8.1 and 8.2 are transported inside the HVPLS in the 
       same manner as customer data.  This is required to properly 
       test the HVPLS.  However, care must be taken to prevent 
       provider network information contained in these test packets 
       from being exposed to the customer network. 
        
       A test packet that is forwarded to the customer network 
       exposes provider network information to the customer network.  
       Therefore, spoke nodes SHOULD always check for such test 
       packets as described in Section 8.1.4.  Any detected test 
       packet SHOULD NOT be forwarded to the customer network. 
        
       Another security concern is the receipt of a VPLS ping or 
       traceroute from a node that is not a member of the HVPLS.  
       Should a HVPLS node respond to a test request from a non-HVPLS 
       member, the response would improperly expose provider network 
       information.  To prevent this from happening, the HVPLS node 
       MAY check to ensure that the return Ethernet MAC address is 
       one of the MAC addresses that it has learned using the 
       Ethernet VPLS node TLV described in Section 9 Note that this 
       requires maintaining the MAC information during the entire 
       operation of the HVPLS. 
        
       13 Scalability Issues 
        
       In [VPLS], targeted LDP sessions are used to distribute VPLS 
       labels. Between core nodes, a complete mesh of targeted LDP 
       sessions is required.
