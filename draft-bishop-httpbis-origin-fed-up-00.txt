                    DNS Security with HTTP/2 ORIGIN
                 draft-bishop-httpbis-origin-fed-up-00

Abstract

   The definition of the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame "relaxes" the requirement
   to check DNS for various reasons.  However, experience has shown that
   such relaxation leads to security risks and is inadvisable.  This
   document restores the original requirements.

1.  Introduction

   [ORIGIN] describes a method whereby an HTTP/2 server can enumerate
   the HTTP origins for which it purports to be authoritative.  This set
   can be greater or lesser than the set of origins over which the
   client might originally have considered the server to be
   authoritative.  Of course, the client will generally not send
   requests to a server unless it considers the server to be
   authoritative for that origin.

   Section 2.4 of [ORIGIN] states that:

      ...clients "MAY avoid consulting DNS to establish the connection's
      authority for new requests to origins in the Origin Set; however,
      those that do so face new risks, as explained in Section 4.

   In Section 4 of [ORIGIN], the attacks this enables are described,
   along with the note that "Clients that blindly trust the ORIGIN
   frame's contents will be vulnerable to a large number of attacks.
   See Section 2.4 for mitigations."

   The mitigation recommended in Section 2.4 is to require the use of
   TLS and that the certificate presented be authoritative for the
   origin in question; the latter is a requirement already present in
   [HTTP2] for HTTP/2 connections using TLS.  In Section 4, it is
   further recommended that:

      ...clients opting not to consult DNS ought to employ some
      alternative means to establish a high degree of confidence that
      the certificate is legitimate.

   Several methods of increasing certificate trust are referenced.
   However, during the discussion of [SecondaryCerts], the ability to
   perform attacks using a misissued or compromised certificate has been
   a concern.  These attacks are fundamentally enabled by the relaxation
   of the requirement to verify DNS ownership, and ongoing community
   concern about these attacks demonstrates that there is no longer
   consensus that these checks do not serve a purpose.

2.  Some Alternative Means

   [ORIGIN] leaves open-ended the decision of when to consider the
   certificate alone sufficient to trust a server's claim of authority
   over an origin.  However, it enumerates some possibilities:

      For example, clients might skip consulting DNS only if they
      receive proof of inclusion in a Certificate Transparency log
      [RFC6962] or if they have a recent Online Certificate Status
      Protocol (OCSP) response [RFC6960] (possibly using the
      "status_request" TLS extension [RFC6066]) showing that the
      certificate was not revoked.

   These mitigations are assuredly helpful in assuring general
   certificate validity, but they fail to fully prevent attacks from
   misissued or compromised certificates.  In particular, a certificate
   which is fraudulently obtained or compromised can remain usable by an
   attacker for nearly two weeks.

2.1.  Certificate Transparency

   Certificate Transparency [RFC6962] defines an experimental protocol
   for publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows
   anyone to audit certificate authority (CA) activity and notice the
   issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate
   logs themselves.

   The expectation is that domain owners (or agents acting on their
   behalf) would actively monitor such logs for domains they control,
   verify that any newly-issued certificates are in fact legitimate, and
   have the certificate revoked if not.

   This does significantly reduce the odds of a misissued certificate
   having a long usable lifetime.  However, it does not reduce that
   lifetime to zero.  A Signed Certificate Timestamp is not proof of
   inclusion in a Certificate Transparency log - it is a promise to
   include a certificate in a future log.  Verification of certificate
   inclusion requires having a Signed Tree Head from that CT log which
   is newer than the SCT by at least that log's "maximum merge delay."

   [CertificateTransparency] A misissued certificate remains invisible
   to inspecting parties for up to this period of time, plus whatever
   time is required to detect the certificate after inclusion.  The
   "maximum merge delay" of most CT logs is twenty-four hours.  (See
   [GoogleTrustedCT], [AppleTrustedCT].)

2.2.  OCSP

   Revocation checking has been a known challenge for TLS clients, with
   OCSP Stapling emerging as the solution of choice.  While an OCSP
   endpoint can often be blocked by an attacker or otherwise be
   unavailable, the "status_request" TLS extension [RFC6066] can enable
   a client to request and the server to provide a recent OCSP response
   as part of the TLS handshake.  This assists in verifying the non-
   revoked state of the certificate without creating a single point of
   failure.

   However, the timeline for a revoked certificate still permits a
   surprising period of exercise, as described in [CABForum]:

   o  CAs have up to 24 hours to revoke a compromised certificate after
      notification; longer for other reasons

   o  Certificate Revocation Lists and OCSP responses have a maximum
      validity period of ten days

   This means that an attacker-held certificate remains potentially
   valid for use by an attacker for as long as eleven days following the
   discovery of a compromise or misissuance, plus any amount of time
   required to discover the situation.

   Additionally, the fact that a certificate has not been revoked is not
   proof that the issuer was permitted to issue it in the first place.
   An attacker-controlled CA could be used to hijack any site and could
   return a fully normal OCSP response.  This indicates that OCSP
   without a publicly-auditable CT entry does not provide sufficient
   proof, especially when private CAs are trusted by the user agent.

3.  Balancing Concerns

   The primary reasons for avoiding the DNS resolution were two-fold.
   First and more simply, there is a latency cost to performing DNS
   resolutions, and this permits clients to minimize latency before
   issuing requests.

   Second and more serious is the fact that DNS is typically performed
   over clear-text.  In addition to the origin itself, other parties
   learn that the client is interested in contacting the origin:

   o  The DNS server operator

   o  The client's Internet Service Provider

   o  Other clients which can observe local network traffic

   By avoiding a DNS resolution for an origin, clients can avoid these
   parties gaining additional information.  However, as described in
   this draft, doing so exposes clients to different security concerns.

3.1.  Improving Privacy

   Given recent developments such as DNS over TLS [DoT] and DNS over
   HTTPS [DoH], there are now alternative means to avoid disclosure of a
   client's DNS activities to anyone other than the DNS server operator.

   [DoT] or [DoH] can be used for DNS resolution when available in order
   to limit unnecessary disclosure of a client's DNS activity to third
   parties.

3.2.  Limiting Scope of Certificate Compromise

   In order to successfully use a fraudulent certificate, an attacker
   needs one of the following situations to occur:

   o  The attacker controls the client's DNS resolution and can provide
      its own IP address as that of the victim domain.

   o  The attacker controls the path between the client and the victim
      domain's real address, and can hijack a TCP connection intended
      for the victim domain's server

   o  The client supports [ORIGIN], the fraudulent certificate contains
      both the victim domain and an attacker-controlled domain, and the
      attacker can induce the client to access an attacker-owned domain

   o  The client supports both [ORIGIN] and [SecondaryCerts], and the
      attacker can induce the client to access an attacker-owned domain

   Following the DNS verifications in [HTTP2], only the first two
   situations will result in the client considering the attacker
   authoritative for the victim domain.  However, if the client relaxes
   DNS checks as specified in [ORIGIN], the latter two attack
   configurations become possible as well.

   As a result, DNS resolution MUST continue to be performed prior to
   accepting a server as valid for an HTTP origin.

3.3.  Updates to RFC 8336

   [ORIGIN] is modified as follows:

   o  The fifth paragraph of Section 2.4 is deleted

   o  The first three paragraphs of Section 4 are replaced with the
      contents of Section 4 from this document

   o  The informative reference to [AltSvc] (Section 5.2) is made a
      normative reference (in Section 5.1)

4.  Security Considerations

   Clients that blindly trust the ORIGIN frame's contents will be
   vulnerable to a large number of attacks.

   Omitting the requirement to consult DNS when determining authority
   for an origin would mean that an attacker who possesses a valid
   certificate no longer needs to be on path to redirect traffic to
   them; instead of modifying DNS, they need only convince the user to
   visit another website in order to coalesce connections to the target
   onto their existing connection.

   Before considering a server to be authoritative for any given origin,
   clients MUST validate that the destination IP address is valid for
   the origin either by direct DNS resolution or resolution of a
   validated Alternative Service [AltSvc].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
