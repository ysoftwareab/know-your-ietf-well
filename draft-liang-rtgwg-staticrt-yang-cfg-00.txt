1.  Introduction

   Static routes are special routes that are configured manually by
   network administrators.  On simple networks, the network
   administrator configures static routes in the routers which cannot
   run dynamic routing protocols or cannot generate routes to a special
   destination network, so that the network can run properly.  Route
   selection can be controlled using static routes.  However, each time
   a fault occurs on the network or the network topology changes, maybe
   the network administrator need to reconfigure the static routes.

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the
   configuration and state data of static route.  Any RPC or
   notification definition is not part of this document. . YANG is
   proving relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other
   interfaces(e.g.  ReST) and encoding other than XML (e.g.  JSON) are
   being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the
   basis of implementation for other interface, such as CLI and
   Programmatic APIs.

   As many vendors have different object constructs to represent the
   same static route, it has been tried to design this model in a very
   flexible, extensible and generic way to fit into most of the vendor
   requirements.

Internet-Draft        Yang Model for Static Routes          October 2015


1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] :

      o configuration data

      o data model

      o module

      o state data

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

      o Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

      o Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

      o Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

      o Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are
      also marked with a colon (":").

      o Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Static Route Data Model

   The data model has the following structure for configuration of
   static routes:

   module: ietf-staticrt
      +--rw staticrt
      |  +--rw staticrt-cfg
      |  |  +--rw staticrt-topo* [VRF-name address-family topo-name]
      |  |     +--rw topo-name           string
      |  |     +--rw VRF-name            string
      |  |     +--rw address-family      identityref
      |  |     +--rw enable-FRR?         boolean

   This data model defines the configuration and state containers for
   static routes.  In staticrt-cfg container, there is a list of
   configuration containers per static route, which contains the
   configuration for static route.

   The data model for state of static routes defines two state
   containers.  Container staticrt-rib contains the current state of
   static routes.  In the second container, there is statistics
   information for static routes.  The staticrt-entries in the staticrt-
   statistics container is listed per routing instance per address
   family.  The list of staticrt-entries is in order of applied rules in
   the forwarding path.

   This data model also defines the configuration for BFD session using
   to detect the configured nexthop reachability of the static route.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration has
   been made.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-staticrt

      Registrant Contact: The RTGWG WG of the IETF.

      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020].

      Name: ietf-staticrt

      Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-staticrt

      Prefix: staticrt

      Reference: RFC xxxx

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.
