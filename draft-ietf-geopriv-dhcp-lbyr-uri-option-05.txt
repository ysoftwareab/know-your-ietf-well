Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option           July 2009

1.  Introduction

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for the downloading of a Location Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) of a client, to be dereferenced in a separate transaction.   
   A client, for example, can be a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
   User Agent (UA)  [RFC3261] (i.e., a Phone).  This location URI 
   points a Location Server [ID-LBYR-REQ] which has the geolocation of
   the client (through means not defined in this document).  

   The Location Server stores the Target's location a presence 
   document, called a Presence Information Date Format - Location 
   Object (PIDF-LO).  Once a client attains this location URI, an 
   application on the target can either dereference the URI to receive 
   its PIDF-LO, or it can convey this location URI instead of conveying
   the location value in a message.  Having a location URI has 
   advantages over having a PIDF-LO, especially when a target's 
   location changes.  With a location URI, when a target moves, the 
   location URI does not. It can still be given out as the Target's 
   location. The opposite is true if the location is conveyed by value 
   in a message. Once the Target moves, the previously given location 
   is no longer valid, and it the Target wants to inform another entity
   about its location, it has to send the PIDF-LO to the location 
   recipient (again). 

   The act of dereferencing location from a location URI is explained 
   in [ID-SIP-LOC], which shows how a Location Recipient of a location 
   URI subscribes to a Location Server to attain the location of the 
   Target. If the dereferencer has permission, defined in [ID-GEO-POL],
   the location of the target will be received.  The Location Server 
   (LS) will grant permission to location inquires based on the rules 
   established by a Rule Holder [RFC3693].  The Location Server has the
   ability to challenge any request of a target's location, thereby 
   providing additive security properties before location revelation. 

   There are use-cases, such as calling the appropriate Pizza Hut 
   without having to look up in a directory which store is closest, 
   where a UA knowing its location can call a 
   main/national/international Pizza Hut number or address and let the 
   UA's location tell Pizza Hut enough information to have them 
   route/retarget the SIP request to the appropriate store within the 
   Pizza Hut organization to deliver the pizza to the caller's 
   location.

   A problem exists within existing RFCs that provide location to the 
   UA ([RFC3825] and [RFC4776]), these DHCP Options for geolocation 
   require an update of the entire location information (LI) every time
   a client moves.  Not all clients will move frequently, but some 
   will.  Refreshing location every time a client moves does not scale
   in certain networks/environments, such as IP based cellular 
   networks, enterprise networks or service provider networks with 
   mobile endpoints.  An 802.11 based access network is one example of 


Polk                   Expires January 13, 2010                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option           July 2009

   this. Constantly updating LCI to endpoints might not scale in mobile
   (residential or enterprise or municipal) networks in which the 
   client is moving through more than one network attachment point, 
   perhaps as a person walks or drives with their endpoint down a 
   neighborhood street or apartment complex or a shopping center. 

   If the client were provided a location URI reference to retain and 
   hand out when it wants or needs to convey its location (in a 
   protocol other than DHCP), a location URI that would not change as 
   the client's location changes (within a domain), scaling issues 
   would be significantly reduced to needing an update of the location 
   URI only when a client changes administrative domains - which is 
   much less often.  This delivery of an indirect location has the 
   added benefit of not using up valuable or limited bandwidth to the 
   client with the constant updates.  It also relieves the client from 
   having to determine when it has moved far enough to consider asking 
   for a refresh of its location.  

   In enterprise networks, if a known location is assigned to each 
   individual Ethernet port in the network, a device that attaches to 
   the network a wall-jack (directly associated with a specific 
   Ethernet Switch port) will be associated with a known location via a
   unique circuit-ID that's used by the RAIO Option defined in RFC 3046
   [RFC3046].  This assumes wall-jacks have an updated wiremap 
   database.  RFC 3825 and RFC 4776 would return an LCI value of 
   location.  This document specifies how a location URI is returned 
   using DHCP.  Behind the DHCP server, in the backend of the network, 
   via the (logical entity of an) LS has a PIDF-LO to be dereferenced 
   with a location URI.  

   If local configuration has the requirement of only assigning unique 
   location URIs to each client, then unique LbyRs will be given out, 
   though they will all have the same location at the record, relieving
   the backend Sighter from individually maintaining each location 
   independently.

   This Option can be useful in WiMAX connected endpoints or IP 
   cellular endpoints.  The location URI Option can be configured as a 
   client if there is a router, such as a residential home gateway, 
   with the ability to communicate to downstream endpoints as a server.

   How an LS challenges a dereference can vary, and a policy 
   established by a rulemaker [RFC3693] for a Location Target as to 
   what type of challenge(s) is to be used, how strong a challenge is 
   used or how precise the location information is given to a 
   requestor. All of this is outside the scope of this document (since 
   this will not be accomplished using DHCP).

   This document IANA registers the new IPv4 and IPv6 DHC Options for a
   location URI.

2.  Format of the DHCP LuriElement Option

2.1 Overall Format of LuriElement Option in IPv4

   The LuriElement Option format for IPv4 is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   Length=XX: The length of this option, counted in bytes - not 
              counting the Code and Length bytes. This is a variable
              length Option, therefore the length value will change 
              based on the length of the LbyR within the Option.

                counting the Code and Length bytes. This is a variable
                length Option, therefore the length value will change 
                based on the shape within the Option.

   Resv:        See above (Section 2.1).

   LuriElement: see below (Section 2.3 for details).


2.3 LuriElement Format for both IPv4 and IPv6

   The LuriElement, in both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, have the following 
   format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Figure 3. LuriElement Format for both IPv4 and IPv6


      LuriType:   A one-byte identifier of the data location value.

      LuriLength: The length, in bytes, of the LuriValue, not including
                  the LuriLength field itself, up to a maximum of 255 
                  bytes.

      LuriValue:  The LuriElement value, as described in detail below.
                  The LuriValue is always in UTP-8.

   The LuriTypes this document defines (and IANA registers) for a point
   are:

      LuriType=1 Location URI - This is the URI pointing at the
                 location record where the PIDF-LO resides which
                 indicates the location of the Location Target.

      LuriType=2 Valid-For - The time, in seconds, this URI is to be 
                 considered Valid for dereferencing. The timer 
                 associated with this LuriType starts upon receipt of 
                 this Option. 

   The LuriType=2 (Valid-For) indicates how long, in seconds, the 
   client is to consider this LuriType=1 (location URI) valid 
   before performing a refresh of this Option, with a refreshed 
   LuriType=2 (Valid-For) value.  A refresh MAY be done merely at the 
   normal DHCP refresh rate, or necessitated by this timer, perhaps 
   with the client only requesting this Option be refreshed.


Polk                   Expires January 13, 2010                [Page 6]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option           July 2009


   It is RECOMMENDED when the counter associated with this LuriType=2 
   (Valid-For) value has passed, the client perform a refresh of this 
   Option.  For example, if 16000 was the initial value of the 
   LuriType=2 (Valid-For) value, when 8000 seconds have passed, the 
   Option SHOULD be refreshed.  

   The LuriType=2 (Valid-For) is not mandated for use by this document.
   However, its presence MUST NOT cause any error in handling the 
   location URI (i.e., if not understood, it MUST be ignored).

   This Option format is highly extensible. Additional LuriType types 
   created MUST be done so through IANA registration with peer review 
   and an RFC.


3. DHC Option Operation

   The [RFC3046] RAIO MUST be utilized to provide the appropriate 
   indication to the DHCP Server where this DISCOVER or REQUEST message
   came from, in order to supply the correct response.  That said, this
   Option SHOULD NOT be in a DISCOVER message, because there is zero 
   knowledge by the client of which Server will answer.  

   Caution SHOULD always be used involving the creation of large 
   Options, meaning that this Option MAY need to be in its own INFORM, 
   OPTION or ACK message.

   It is RECOMMENDED to avoid building URIs, with any parameters, 
   larger than what a single DHCP response can be.  However, if a 
   message is larger than 255 bytes, concatenation is allowed, per RFC 
   3396 [RFC3396].

   Per [RFC2131], subsequent LuriElement Options, which are 
   non-concatenated, overwrite the previous value.

   location URIs MUST NOT reveal identity information of the user of 
   the device, since DHCP is a cleartext delivery protocol. For 
   example, location URIs such as

      sips:34LKJH534663J54@example.com 

   SHOULD be done, providing no identity information, rather than a 
   location URI such as this

      sips:aliceisinatlanta@example.com

   In the <presence> element of the PIDF-LO there is an entity= 
   attribute that identities the target of *this* location.  It is up 
   to the PIDF-LO generator, either Location Server or an application 
   in the endpoint, to insert the identity in the entity= attribute.  
   This can be seen in [RFC4119].  The entity= discussion is orthogonal


Polk                   Expires January 13, 2010                [Page 7]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option           July 2009

   to the identification information contained within the location URI.

   This Option is only for communications between a DHCP client and a 
   DHCP server.  It can be solicited (requested) by the client, or it 
   can be pushed by the server without a request for it.  DHCP Options 
   not understood are ignored.  A DHCP server might or might not have 
   the location of a client, therefore direct knowledge of a 
   location URI within the server.  If a server does not have a 
   client's location, a communication path (or request) to an LS would 
   be necessary.  

   Further, any location revelation rules and policies a user has
   regarding the treatment of their actual location, and who can 
   access (what precision of) their location will be done with a 
   protocol other than DHCP, and likely will be done before anything 
   other than default authentication and authorization permissions are 
   used when a Location Recipient requests for a Target's location. 

   Differentiating clients is done via client identifiers.  Therefore, 
   in many implementations, each client can be assigned unique location
   URIs, though this is not mandatory.

   Any dereferencing of a client's location URI would not involve DHCP 
   as well, but more likely by an application layer protocol such as 
   SIP, through a subscription to the location URI on the LS. The LS 
   would also handle all authentication and authorization of location 
   requests, which is also not performed with DHCP, therefore not 
   defined here.

   In the case of residential gateways being DHCP servers, they usually
   perform as DHCP clients in a hierarchical fashion up into a service 
   provider's network DHCP server(s), or learn what information to 
   provide via DHCP to residential clients through a protocol such as 
   PPP.  In these cases, the location URI would likely indicate the 
   residence's civic address to all wired or wireless clients within 
   that residence.  This is not inconsistent with what's stated above.


3.1 Architectural Assumptions

   The following assumptions have been made for use of this LuriElement
   Option for a client to learn its location URI (in no particular 
   order):

   o  Any user control (what [RFC3693] calls a 'ruleholder') for the 
      parameters and profile options a Location Object will have is out
      of scope of this document, but assumed to take place via an 
      external web interface between the user and the Location Server 
      (direct or indirect).  Some of this is described in [ID-GEO-POL].

   o  The authorization vs. possession security model can be found in 
      [ID-LBYR-REQ], describing what is expected in each model of 


Polk                   Expires January 13, 2010                [Page 8]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option           July 2009

      operation.  It should be assumed that a location URI attained 
      using DHCP will operate under an authorization model. This means 
      possessing the location URI does not give that entity the right 
      to view the PIDF-LO of the target whose location is indicated in
      a presence document.  The dereference transaction will be, in 
      many environments, challenged by the Location Server.  The nature
      of this challenge is out of scope of this document.  

   o  This document does not prevent some environments from operating 
      in a possession model, for example - tightly controlled 
      enterprise networks, but this operation SHOULD NOT be assumed to 
      exist as a matter of local policy. The costs associated with 
      authorization vs. possession models are discussed in section 
      3.3.2 of [ID-GEO-RA].


3.2 Harmful URIs and URLs

   There are, in fact, some types of URIs that are not good to receive,
   due to security concerns.  For example, any URLs that can have 
   scripts, such as "data:" URLs, and some "HTTP:" URLs that go to web 
   pages that have scripts.  Therefore,

   o URIs received via this Option SHOULD NOT be sent to a 
     general-browser to connect to a web page, because they could have 
     harmful scripts.

   o This Option SHOULD NOT contain "data:" URLs, because they could 
     contain harmful scripts.

   Instead of listing all the types of URIs and URLs that can be 
   misused or potentially have harmful affects, Section 3.3 IANA 
   registers acceptable location URI schemes (or types).


3.3  Valid Location URI Schemes or Types

   This section specifies which URI types are acceptable as a location 
   URI scheme (or type) for this DHCP Option:

   1. sip:
   2. sips:
   3. pres:

   These location URI types are IANA registered in section 4.2 of this 
   document.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1 The IPv4 Option number for this Option

   This document IANA registers this IPv4 Option number XXX (to be 
   assigned by IANA once this document becomes an RFC).


4.2 The IPv6 Option-Code for this Option

   This document IANA registers this IPv6 Option-Code XXX (to be 
   assigned by IANA once this document becomes an RFC).


4.3 The Version number for this Option

   This document IANA registers the version number 1 of this Option.


4.4 IANA Considerations for Acceptable Location URI Types

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for acceptable location 
   URI types.  

   The following 3 URI types are registered by this document:

   1. sip:
   2. sips:
   3. pres:

   Any additional location URI types to be defined for use via 
   this DHC Option need to be created and IANA registered with peer 
   review and an RFC.

4.5 IANA Considerations for LuriTypes 

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for acceptable location 
   types defined in section 3.2 of this document, arranged similar to 
   this:

   +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
   |  LuriType  |   Name                                 | Reference |
   +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
   |     1      |   Location URI                         | RFC XXXX* |
   |     2      |   Valid-For                            | RFC XXXX* |
   +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
    
    * RFC XXXX is to be replaced with this document's RFC-Editor RFC 
      number.

   Additions to this list require a standards track RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this 
   location URI option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD be used
   to protect the integrity of the DHCP options.  

   A real concern with RFC 3118 it is that not widely deployed because 
   it requires pre-shared keys to successfully work (i.e., in the
   client and in the server).  Most implementations do not 
   accommodate this.

   DHCP is a broadcast initially (a client looking for a server), 
   unicast response (answer from a server) type of protocol.  It is not
   secure in a practical sense.  In today's infrastructures, DHCP will 
   be primarily used over a wired, switched Ethernet network, requiring
   physical access to within a wire to gain access.  Further, within an
   802.11 wireless network, the 802.11 specs have layer 2 security 
   mechanisms in place to help prevent a location URI from being 
   learned by an unauthorized entity.

   That said, having the location URI does not mean an unauthorized 
   entity has the location of a client.  The location URI still needs 
   to be dereferenced to learn the location of the client.  This 
   dereferencing function, which is not done using DHCP, is done by 
   requesting the location record at a Location Server, which is a 
   defined entity built to challenge each request it receives based on 
   a joint policy of what is called a rulemaker.  The ruleholder, as 
   defined in RFC 3693, configures the authentication and authorization
   policies for the location revelation of a Target.  This includes 
   giving out more or less precise location information in a response, 
   therefore it can answer a bad-hat, but not allow it from learning 
   exactly where a client is.  The rulemaker, which is a combination of
   the default rules set up by the location provider and those decided 
   on by the user of the Target device.  Likely, the rules the user 
   wants will not be allowed to go past some limits established by the 
   location provider, i.e., the administrator of the LS, for various 
   capability or security reasons.

   Penetrating an LS is supposed to be hard, and hopefully vendors that
   implement an LS accomplish this goal.

   It is envisioned, as stated in the text above, as described both in 
   [ID-LBYR-REQ] and [ID-GEO-RA], this Option MUST be assumed to 
   operate under an authorization model, vs. a much more open 
   possession model.  This model choice is not strictly enforced, but 
   implementations (in the text above) have been advised to build with 
   this in mind.

   As to the concerns about the location URI itself, as stated in the 
   document here (in Section 3.), it MUST NOT have any user identifying
   information in the URI user-part/string itself.  The location URI

   also needs to be hard to guess that it belongs to a specific user.  
   There is some debate as to whether this location URI need be a 
   random alphanumeric string or just unique.  If the latter, there is 
   some debate as to the how we define unique. Is that through space 
   and time, as RFC 3261 defines a SIP Call-ID needs to be (meaning: 
   never a duplicate, ever, by any device, ever)? Or is it unique to 
   within a specific domain for as long as it is actively assigned to a
   client (plus some interval).

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an 
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security 
   risks therein.
