Abstract

   This document is an addendum to RFC xxxx, which specifies the 
   real-time transport protocol for the Variable-Rate Multimode 
   Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec. This document contains the 
   information related to the new operating mode of VMR-WB. All 
   provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc. that are 
   specified in RFC xxxx are applicable to the new operating mode 
   without any exception.

   No new media type registration is included in this document as the
   new VMR-WB mode, defined in this document, will use the same media
   type specified in RFC xxxx (i.e., audio/VMR-WB). Note that the 
   RFC xxxx was developed with sufficient flexibility for future 
   extensions and thereby it allows the addition of new operating 
   modes without any impacts on the interoperability of terminals
   supporting different versions of the VMR-WB standard.

1. Introduction

   This document is an addendum to RFC xxxx [2] and contains the
   necessary updates for the support of the new operating mode of 3GPP2 
   VMR-WB standard [1]. The new mode of VMR-WB standard (i.e., VMR-WB
   mode 4) has similar characteristics (e.g., narrowband/wideband 
   input/output media processing capability, continuous and 
   discontinuous transmission, etc.)  as the other modes of VMR-WB
   already included in RFC xxxx. Therefore, all provisions and  
   restrictions specified in RFC xxxx are applicable to all modes of
   the VMR-WB standard including the new mode, which is described in 
   this document.

   As a result, no media type registration is required. The VMR-WB file 
   format; i.e., for transport of VMR-WB speech data in storage mode
   applications, is specified in [1,4] and supports the new mode.

   The following sections provide the necessary updates to RFC xxxx to
   enable support of VMR-WB mode 4.

   
2. Conventions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as

   described in RFC2119 [3].

   The following acronyms are used in this document:

    3GPP2  - The Third Generation Partnership Project 2
    CDMA   - Code Division Multiple Access
    VMR-WB - Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband Codec
    CMR    - Codec Mode Request
    DTX    - Discontinuous Transmission
    RTP    - Real-Time Transport Protocol
    MIME   - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension
    SDP    - Session Description Protocol
    
   The term "frame-block" is used in this document to describe
   the time-synchronized set of speech frames in a multi-channel

   
3. The Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Extension

   VMR-WB is the wideband speech-coding standard developed by
   Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) for
   encoding/decoding wideband/narrowband speech content in
   multimedia services in 3G CDMA cellular systems [1]. VMR-WB is a
   source-controlled variable-rate multimode wideband speech
   codec. It has a number of operating modes, where each mode is
   a tradeoff between voice quality and average data rate. The
   operating mode in VMR-WB (as shown in Table 2) is chosen based on 
   the traffic condition of the network and the desired quality of 
   service. The desired average data rate (ADR) in each mode
   is obtained by encoding speech frames at permissible rates (as shown 
   in Tables 1 and 3) compliant with CDMA2000 system depending on the
   instantaneous characteristics of input speech and the maximum and 
   minimum rate constraints imposed by the network operator.

   The capabilities of the VMR-WB codec were extended through the 
   addition of a new mode operating at lower average data rates, 
   resulting in improved system capacity in IP and non-IP networks [1]. 

   As a result of this extension, certain tables and parameters in RFC 
   xxxx must be updated to support of the new operating mode. VMR-WB 
   mode 4 is compliant with all applicable provisions and restrictions 
   specified in RFC xxxx [2]. 

   The existing flexibility in RFC xxxx for future extensions allows 
   the addition of the new mode without any impact on the 
   interoperability with earlier implementations of RFC xxxx.

   The following sections provide the necessary updates that are 
   required to be made in RFC xxxx.

   and VMR-WB mode 4 with maximum half-rate similar to that described 
   in Section 2.4 of the revised VMR-WB specification [1].

   for the use of header-free payload format for all modes of 
   operations [2].

7.1. VMR-WB RTP Payload MIME Registration

   No MIME registration is required for the new mode of VMR-WB. The 
   only necessary update is in the definition of the optional MIME 
   parameter "mode-set" by adding the new operating mode. Note that
   the addition of the new mode does not create any interoperability 
   issues since the modes of operation are negotiated and agreed 
   by the IP terminals through the offer-answer model provided in
   Section 9.3 of RFC xxxx [2].

     mode-set:       Requested VMR-WB operating mode set. Restricts
                     the active operating modes to a subset of all
                     modes. Possible values are a comma separated
                     list of integer values. Currently, this list
                     includes modes 0,1,2, 3, and 4 [1,2] but MAY be
                     extended in the future. If such mode-set is
                     specified during session initiation, the encoder
                     MUST NOT use modes outside of the subset. If not
                     present, all operating modes in the set 0 to 4 are
                     allowed for the session.
