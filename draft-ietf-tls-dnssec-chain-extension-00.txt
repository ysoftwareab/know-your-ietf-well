    A DANE Record and DNSSEC Authentication Chain Extension for TLS
                draft-ietf-tls-dnssec-chain-extension-00

Abstract

   This draft describes a new TLS extension for transport of a DNS
   record set serialized with the DNSSEC signatures needed to
   authenticate that record set.  The intent of this proposal is to
   allow TLS clients to perform DANE authentication of a TLS server
   certificate without needing to perform additional DNS record lookups.
   It will typically not be used for general DNSSEC validation of TLS
   endpoint names.

2.  Introduction

   This draft describes a new TLS [RFC5246] extension for transport of a
   DNS record set serialized with the DNSSEC signatures [RFC4034] needed
   to authenticate that record set.  The intent of this proposal is to
   allow TLS clients to perform DANE authentication [RFC6698] of a TLS
   server certificate without performing perform additional DNS record
   lookups and incurring the associated latency penalty.  It also
   provides the ability to avoid potential problems with TLS clients
   being unable to look up DANE records because of an interfering or
   broken middlebox on the path between the endpoint and a DNS server.
   And lastly, it allows a TLS client to validate DANE records itself
   without needing access to a validating DNS resolver to which it has a

   secure connection.  It will typically not be used for general DNSSEC
   validation of endpoint names, but is more appropriate for validation
   of DANE TLSA records.

   This mechanism is useful for TLS applications that need to address
   the problems described above, typically web browsers or VoIP and XMPP
   services.  It may not be relevant for many other applications.  For
   example, SMTP MTAs are usually located in data centers, may tolerate
   extra DNS lookup latency, are on servers where it is easier to
   provision a validating resolver, or are less likely to experience
   traffic interference from misconfigured middleboxes.  Furthermore,
   SMTP MTAs usually employ Opportunistic Security [RFC7435], in which
   the presence of the DNS TLSA records is used to determine whether to
   enforce an authenticated TLS connection.  Hence DANE authentication
   of SMTP MTAs [RFC7672] will typically not use this mechanism.

   The extension described here allows a TLS client to request in the
   client hello message that the DNS authentication chain be returned in
   the (extended) server hello message.  If the server is configured for
   DANE authentication, then it performs the appropriate DNS queries,
   builds the authentication chain, and returns it to the client.  The
   server will usually use a previously cached authentication chain, but
   it will need to rebuild it periodically as described in Section 5.
   The client then authenticates the chain using a pre-configured trust
   anchor.

   This specification is based on Adam Langley's original proposal for
   serializing DNSSEC authentication chains and delivering them in an
   X.509 certificate extension [AGL].  It modifies the approach by using
   wire format DNS records in the serialized data (assuming that the
   data will be prepared and consumed by a DNS-specific library), and by
   using a TLS extension to deliver the data.

3.  DNSSEC Authentication Chain Extension

3.1.  Protocol

   A client MAY include an extension of type "dnssec_chain" in the
   (extended) ClientHello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension
   MUST be empty.

   Servers receiving a "dnssec_chain" extension in the client hello, and
   which are capable of being authenticated via DANE, SHOULD return a
   serialized authentication chain in the extended ServerHello message,
   using the format described below.  If a server is unable to return a
   authentication chain, or does not wish to return a authentication
   chain, it does not include a dnssec_chain extension.  As with all TLS

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension              June 2016


   extensions, if the server does not support this extension it will not
   return any authentication chain.

3.2.  DNSSEC Authentication Chain Data

   The "extension_data" field of the "dnssec_chain" extension MUST
   contain a DNSSEC Authentication Chain encoded in the following form:


             opaque AuthenticationChain<0..2^16-1>;

   The AuthenticationChain structure is composed of a sequence of
   uncompressed wire format DNS resource record sets (RRset) and
   corresponding signatures (RRsig) records.  The record sets and
   signatures are presented in validation order, starting at the target
   DANE record, followed by the DNSKEY and DS record sets for each
   intervening DNS zone up to a trust anchor chosen by the server,
   typically the DNS root.

   This sequence of native DNS wire format records enables easier
   generation of the data structure on the server and easier
   verification of the data on client by means of existing DNS library
   functions.  However this document describes the data structure in
   sufficient detail that implementers if they desire can write their
   own code to do this.

   [TODO: mention that to reduce the size of the chain, the server can
   deliver exactly one RRsig per RRset, namely the one used to validate
   the chain as it is built.]

   Each RRset in the chain is composed of a sequence of wire format DNS
   resource records.  The format of the resource record is described in
   RFC 1035 [RFC1035], Section 3.2.1.  The resource records SHOULD be
   presented in the canonical form and ordering as described in RFC 4034
   [RFC4034].


             RR(i) = owner | type | class | TTL | RDATA length | RDATA

   RRs within the RRset are ordered canonically, by treating the RDATA
   portion of each RR as a left-justified unsigned octet sequence in
   which the absence of an octet sorts before a zero octet.

   The RRsig record is in DNS wire format as described in RFC 4034
   [RFC4034], Section 3.1.  The signature portion of the RDATA, as
   described in the same section, is the following:

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension              June 2016


             signature = sign(RRSIG_RDATA | RR(1) | RR(2)... )

   where, RRSIG_RDATA is the wire format of the RRSIG RDATA fields with
   the Signer's Name field in canonical form and the signature field
   excluded.

   The first RRset in the chain MUST contain the DANE records being
   presented.  The subsequent RRsets MUST be a sequence of DNSKEY and DS
   RRsets, starting with a DNSKEY RRset.  Each RRset MUST authenticate
   the preceding RRset:

   o  A DNSKEY RRset must include the DNSKEY RR containing the public
      key used to verify the previous RRset.

   o  For a DS RRset, the set of key hashes MUST overlap with the
      preceding set of DNSKEY records.

   In addition, a DNSKEY RRset followed by a DS RRset MUST be self-
   signed, in the sense that its RRSIG MUST verify under one of the keys
   in the DNSKEY RRSET.

   The final DNSKEY RRset in the authentication chain, containing the
   trust anchor may be omitted.  If omitted, the client MUST verify that
   the key tag and owner name in the final RRSIG record correspond to a
   trust anchor.  There may however be reason to include the trust
   anchor RRset and signature if clients are expected to use RFC5011
   compliant key rollover functions inband via the chain data.  In that
   case, they will need to periodically inspect flags (revocation and
   secure entry point flags) on the trust anchor DNSKEY RRset.

   For example, for an HTTPS server at www.example.com, where there are
   zone cuts at "com." and "example.com.", the AuthenticationChain
   structure would comprise the following RRsets and signatures (the
   data field of the records are omitted here for brevity):


             _443._tcp.www.example.com. TLSA
             RRSIG(_443._tcp.www.example.com. TLSA)
             example.com. DNSKEY
             RRSIG(example.com. DNSKEY)
             example.com. DS
             RRSIG(example.com. DS)
             com. DNSKEY
             RRSIG(com. DNSKEY)
             com. DS
             RRSIG(com. DS)
             . DNSKEY
             RRSIG(. DNSKEY)

   Names that are aliased via CNAME and/or DNAME records may involve
   multiple branches of the DNS tree.  In this case the authentication
   chain structure will be composed of a sequence of these multiple
   intersecting branches.  DNAME chains should omit unsigned CNAME
   records that may have been synthesized in the response from a DNS
   resolver.  Wildcard DANE records will need to include the wildcard
   name as well as a negative proof (i.e.  NSEC or NSEC3 records) that
   no closer name exists.


         A CNAME example:

         _443._tcp.www.example.com.   IN   CNAME    ca.example.net.
         ca.example.net.              IN   TLSA     2 0 1 ...

         Here the authentication chain structure is composed of two
         consecutive chains, one for _443._tcp.www.example.com/CNAME
         and one for ca.example.net/TLSA. The second chain can omit
         the record sets at the end that overlap with the first.

         TLS DNSSEC chain components:

         _443._tcp.www.example.com. CNAME
         RRSIG(_443._tcp.www.example.com. CNAME)
         example.com. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(example.com. DNSKEY)
         example.com. DS
         RRSIG(example.com. DS)
         com. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(com. DNSKEY)
         com. DS
         RRSIG(com. DS)
         . DNSKEY
         RRSIG(. DNSKEY)

         ca.example.net. TLSA
         RRSIG(ca.example.net. TLSA)
         example.net. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(example.net. DNSKEY)
         example.net. DS
         RRSIG(example.net. DS)
         net. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(net. DNSKEY)
         net. DS

4.  Construction of Serialized Authentication Chains

   This section describes a possible procedure for the server to use to
   build the serialized DNSSEC chain.

   When the goal is to perform DANE authentication [RFC6698] of the
   server's X.509 certificate, the DNS record set to be serialized is a
   TLSA record set corresponding to the server's domain name.

   The domain name of the server MUST be that included in the TLS Server
   Name Indication extension [RFC6066] when present.  If the Server Name
   Indication extension is not present, or if the server does not
   recognize the provided name and wishes to proceed with the handshake
   rather than to abort the connection, the server uses the domain name
   associated with the server IP address to which the connection has
   been established.

   The TLSA record to be queried is constructed by prepending the _port
   and _transport labels to the domain name as described in [RFC6698],
   where "port" is the port number associated with the TLS server.  The
   transport is "tcp" for TLS servers, and "udp" for DTLS servers.  The
   port number label is the left-most label, followed by the transport,
   followed by the base domain name.

   The components of the authentication chain are built by starting at
   the target record set and its corresponding RRSIG.  Then traversing
   the DNS tree upwards towards the trust anchor zone (normally the DNS
   root), for each zone cut, the DNSKEY and DS RRsets and their
   signatures are added.  If DNS responses messages contain any domain
   names utilizing name compression [RFC1035], then they must be
   uncompressed.

   In the future, proposed DNS protocol enhancements, such as the EDNS
   Chain Query extension [CHAINQUERY] may offer easy ways to obtain all
   of the chain data in one transaction with an upstream DNSSEC aware
   recursive server.

5.  Caching and Regeneration of the Authentication Chain

   DNS records have Time To Live (TTL) parameters, and DNSSEC signatures
   have validity periods (specifically signature expiration times).
   After the TLS server constructs the serialized authentication chain,
   it SHOULD cache and reuse it in multiple TLS connection handshakes.
   However, it MUST refresh and rebuild the chain as TTLs and signature
   validity periods dictate.  A server implementation could carefully
   track these parameters and requery component records in the chain
   correspondingly.  Alternatively, it could be configured to rebuild
   the entire chain at some predefined periodic interval that does not

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension              June 2016


   exceed the DNS TTLs or signature validity periods of the component
   records in the chain.

6.  Verification

   A TLS client making use of this specification, and which receives a
   DNSSEC authentication chain extension from a server, SHOULD use this
   information to perform DANE authentication of the server certificate.
   In order to do this, it uses the mechanism specified by the DNSSEC
   protocol [RFC4035].  This mechanism is sometimes implemented in a
   DNSSEC validation engine or library.

   If the authentication chain is correctly verified, the client then
   performs DANE authentication of the server according to the DANE TLS
   protocol [RFC6698], and the additional protocol requirements outlined
   in [RFC7671].

7.  Trust Anchor Maintenance

   The trust anchor may change periodically, e.g. when the operator of
   the trust anchor zone performs a DNSSEC key rollover.  Managed key
   rollovers typically use a process that can be tracked by verifiers
   allowing them to automatically update their trust anchors, as
   described in [RFC5011].  TLS clients using this specification are
   also expected to use such a mechanism to keep their trust anchors
   updated.  Some operating systems may have a system-wide service to
   maintain and keep the root trust anchor up to date.  In such cases,
   the TLS client application could simply reference that as its trust
   anchor, periodically checking whether it has changed.

8.  Mandating use of this extension

   A TLS server certificate MAY mandate the use of this extension by
   means of the X.509 TLS Feature Extension described in [RFC7633].
   This X.509 certificate extension, when populated with the
   dnssec_chain TLS extension identifier, indicates to the client that
   the server must deliver the authentication chain when asked to do so.
   (The X.509 TLS Feature Extension is the same mechanism used to
   deliver other mandatory signals, such as OCSP "must staple"
   assertions.)

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the normatively referenced RFCs (1035,
   4034, 4035, 5246, 6066, 6698, 7633, 7671) all pertain to this
   extension.  Since the server is delivering a chain of DNS records and
   signatures to the client, it MUST rebuild the chain in accordance
   with TTL and signature expiration of the chain components as

   described in Section 5.  TLS clients need roughly accurate time in
   order to properly authenticate these signatures.  This could be
   achieved by running a time synchronization protocol like NTP
   [RFC5905] or SNTP [RFC5905], which are already widely used today.
   TLS clients MUST support a mechanism to track and rollover the trust
   anchor key, or be able to avail themselves of a service that does
   this, as described in Section 7.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This extension requires the registration of a new value in the TLS
   ExtensionsType registry.  The value requested from IANA is 53.  If
   the draft is adopted by the WG, the authors expect to make an early
   allocation request as specified in [RFC7120].

   extension.  The original idea is his but our acknowledgment in no way
   implies his endorsement.  This document also benefited from
