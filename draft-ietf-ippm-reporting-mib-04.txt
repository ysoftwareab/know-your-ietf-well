1.                   Introduction 
   This memo defines a MIB for managing network measurements based upon 
   the IP performance metrics specified by the IPPM Working Group. 
    
   The definition of objects in the IPPM MIB are built on notions 
   introduced and discussed in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330 
   [ii]. 
    
   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB), and as such it 
   is intended to be respectful of the "Boilerplate for IETF MIBs" 
   defined in http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html. 
    
   There are companion documents to the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB both in the 
   Transport Area (See section 2), and in the Operations and Management

   Area (See section 3). The reader should be familiar with these 
   documents.  
    
2.                   The IPPM Framework 
    
   The IPPM Framework consists of 3 major components: 
    
   A general framework for defining performance metrics, as described in 
   the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 2330 [2]; 
    
   A set of standardized metrics which conform to this framework: The 
   IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [iii]; The One-way 
   Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2679 [iv]; The One-way Packet Loss Metric 
   for IPPM, RFC 2680 [v]; The Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 
   2681 [vi]. 
    
   Emerging metrics that are being specified in respect of this 
   framework. 
 
    
3.                   The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework consists of five major components: 
    
        An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2]. 
    
        Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, 
   RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].  The second 
   version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [6], STD 58, 
   RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8]. 
    
        Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
   first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second version of the SNMP 
   message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, 
   is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC 1906 [11].  
   The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
   described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574 [13]. 
    
        Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol 
   operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [14]. 
    
        A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and 
   the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [16]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB               October 2003 
                                      
                                      
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
   MIB. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.   
    
   The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely 
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human 
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to 
   refer to the object type.

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB               October 2003 
                                      
                                      
    
 
4.                   Overview 
    
   Although the number of measurement devices that implement IPPM 
   metrics is growing, there is not currently any standardized 
   management interface to manage remotely the measurement of these 
   metrics. This memo defines a Management Information Base for managing 
   the measurement of IPPM metrics.  
    
   To permit metrics to be referenced by other MIBs and other protocols, 
   the IPPM WG has defined a registry of the current metrics and a 
   framework for the integration of future metrics in the [IPPM metrics 
   registry]. 
    
   As the specification of new metrics is a continuous process, this 
   memo defines a framework for the integration of the future 
   standardized metrics.  
    
   The MIB architecture is inspired by the RMON model [xxiii],[xxiv] 
   which specifies the MIB for the monitoring of a single point of 
   measure. The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB differs from this model in that IPPM 
   metrics measurement involves several points of measure and requires 
   common references for time and for measure identification.  
    
   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB introduces a framework where each application 
   identifies its measures in an owner namespace. The administrator may 
   grant access to a measure, or set of measures to another owner via 
   view based access control. As a result, one owner may compute 
   aggregated metrics on another owner’s network measures. 
    
   Different architectures may be used to perform metric measurements, 
   using a control protocol and a test protocol. Different control 
   frameworks are suitable for performing measurements. The memo lists 
   them, while also looking for a way to integrate them with the IPPM-
   REPORTING-MIB. This section is for informational purposes only, and 
   is intended to help specify the relationship among the test protocol, 
   the control protocol and the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB. 
    
   Special care has been taken to provide a reporting mode suitable for 
   control protocols and test protocols. It addresses the need to 
   provide access to results for the applications. Moreover, it may be 
   used to reduce the number of control frameworks. 
    
   This MIB is intended to handle multiple concurrent sessions by SNMP 
   applications. However, the SNMP requests are not necessarily to be 
   handled explicitly by the measurement devices, but can be sent to 
   middleware performing an aggregation function. This allows for 
   continuous collection of measurements and statistics computation.

4.1.                     Textual Conventions 
    
      Seven types of data are introduced as textual conventions in this 
   document: IppmOwnerString, TimeUnit, TypeP, TypePaddress, 
   GMTTimeStamp, IppmStandardMetrics and IppmReportDefinition. 
    
4.1.1   IppmOwnerString 
    
    This octet string is used to represent the owners of the various 
    measures and reports in the measurement system.  
 
4.1.2   TimeUnit 
     
    This textual convention is used to indicate a unit of time, ranging 
    from nanosecond, microsecond, millisecond, second, hour, day, and 
    week. 
    
4.1.3   TypeP and TypePaddress  
    
   Section 13 of the IPPM framework [2] introduces the generic notion of 
   a "packet of type P", because in some contexts the metric's value 
   depends on the type of the packets involved in the metric. In the 
   definition of a metric, the type P will be explicitly defined, 
   partially defined, or left generic. Measurement of metrics defined 
   with generic type P are made specific when performing actual 
   measurements. It is important that one be conscious of the exact type 
   of traffic being measured. 
    
   The standardization of the management of IPPM measures relies on the 
   capability to unambiguously configure the type P of the packets, and 
   the parameters of the protocol suites of the type P. 
    
   RMON2 introduced the concept of protocol identifiers.  RFC2895 [xxv] 
   specifies a macro for the definition of protocol identifier. The 
   RFC2896 [xxvi] defines the protocol identifiers for different 
   protocol encapsulation trees. 
    
   The type P implementation relies on the MACRO PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER 
   defined for identifying protocol suites in RMON2. It is achieved by 
   defining the TypeP and the TypePaddress as new syntax in SMIv2 
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION. 
    
4.1.3.1 Internet addresses 
    
   The section 14 of the IPPM framework defines (for the usual case of a 
   unidirectional path through the Internet) the term "Src" and "Dst". 
   "Src" denotes the IP address of the beginning of the path, and "Dst" 
   denotes the IP address of the end.  
    
   The section 3 of the RMON PI Reference specifies the Protocol 
   Identifier Encoding rules, which consists briefly in a recursive

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB               October 2003 
                                      
                                      
   length value format. "Src" and "Dst" are protocol identifier 
   parameters. Their values are encoded in separated fields using the 
   encoding rules of the protocol identifier, but without trailing 
   parameters. 
    
   The packet encapsulation defined in an instance of TypeP embeds the 
   format of "Src" and "Dst" and their values. The type and value of 
   these addresses depend on the type P of the packet, IP version 4, 
   IPV6, IP in IP... Both participate in the completion of the packet 
   encoding.  
    
   Examples: 
    
   RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers ip and ipip4. Should there 
   be an Internet tunnel end-point of the IP address 192.168.1.1 in the 
   tunnel 128.2.6.7. the TypeP of the source address of the tunnel, Src, 
   is 'ip.ipip4'. The encoding of 'ip.ipip4' using the RFC2895 rules 
   adds a trailer 2.0.0. It means that an instance of this protocol 
   identifier has 2 parameters, which values will be set only when 
   implemented. In the IPPM TypeP context these 2 parameters are 
   provided in Src (or Dst). In the current example the value of Src is 
   "192.168.1.1 128.2.6.7". 
    
4.1.4   GMTTimeStamp 
    
   This textual convention defines the time at which an event occurred. 
   It is very similar to the NTP timestamp format except that it 
   represents the time elapsed since January 1st, 2000 instead of 
   January 1st, 1900. 
    
 
4.1.5   IppmStandardMetrics 
    
   Each standard metric is identified in the IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY under 
   the node rfc in chronological order. This textual convention defines 
   an octet string to permit several metrics to be performed in a single 
   measure.  
    
4.1.6   Report definition 
    
   A report consists of sending, or logging, a subset of results of 
   measurements that have been taken over a period of time. The report 
   defines actions that are taken on the measurement results. An action 
   is performed either: 
    
   + For each result 
   + On the results corresponding to a measurement cycle 
   + On the results available at the measurement completion.  
    
   To preserve the scalability of the whole measurement system, it 
   limits:

   + The amount of data sent to the applications 
   + The bandwidth consumption for uploading the result 
   + The number of alarms sent to the applications 
   + The amount of data saved in the point of measure 
         
    
   Metric thresholds (low, high, inband, outband...) may be defined that 
   indicate when measure values should be reported. These values and 
   their associated time may directly impact service availability. 
    
   One may also want to report when particular values (i.e. constantly 
   over a threshold) repeatedly occur over a period of time. For 
   example, if one-way-day is constantly over a specified acceptable 
   threshold value for 10 minutes, then the values should be reported.  
    
    
   The combination of IPPM metric results, threshold events, and event 
   filtering provides a very efficient mechanism to report measurement 
   results, events, and alarms. 
    
   A report is described using the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 
   IppmReportDefinition. The report setup must not dramatically increase 
   the amount of data needed by the control protocol to setup a measure: 
    
   +  A basic report is defined in the object ippmReportSetupDefinition; 
   +  More elaborate reports are described using a metric threshold to 
   generate alarms and events.  
   +  The generation of alarms and reports requires a management station 
   address to which the data will be sent. 
   +  SLA alarms are described using an events duration threshold. 
    
   The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION IppmReportDefinition specifies the list of 
   events and actions that are used to create a report. 
    
 
4.2     Structure of the MIB 
 
   The MIB is arranged as follow:                        
    
   - ippmSystem  
    
   - ippmOwners  
    
   - ippmMeasure 
    
   - ippmHistory                 
    
   - ippmNetMeasure              
    
   - ippmAggrMeasure

   - ippmReport 
    
   - ippmNotifications   
         
         
4.2.1   The ippmSystem Group 
    
   This group consists of a set of parameters describing the clock 
   synchronization at a particular point of measure over time, as well 
   as the system clock where the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent resides. 
    
   This group is critical to the implementation of the IPPM MIB.  
    
   Section 6.3. of the IPPM Framework states that 
   "Those who develop such measurement methodologies should strive to: 
     +    Minimize their uncertainties/errors, 
     +    Understand and document the sources of uncertainty/error, and 
     +    Quantify the amounts of uncertainty/error." 
    
   The aim of this group is to have these values available to compute 
   reliable statistics. The implementation of this group is mandatory, 
   whether the time synchronization is automatic or not. 
    
4.2.2   The ippmOwners Group  
    
   This group identifies an owner, or group of owners, that have access 
   to measurements on a probe. 
 
4.2.3   The ippmMeasure Group 
    
   This group contains all the IPPM metrics that are registered and 
   available for use by the agent. 
 
   The measurement entity describes in the ippmMetricsTable of the SNMP 
   agent the local implementation of the standardized metrics. All 
   standardized metrics should be displayed in this table, with the 
   ippmMetricCapabilities object defining whether the metric is 
   implemented or not. 
    
4.2.4   The ippmHistory Group 
    
   The results of any given measure are stored in the ippmHistoryTable. 
   The indexing is such that there is an entry in this table for each 
   result of a given measure for a given metric. 
    
4.2.5   The ippmNetMeasure Group  
    
   The control protocol registers a description of the existing network 
   measures in the ippmNetMeasureTable.

   This group displays the network measures defined by the control 
   protocol. The results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable.  
    
   ippmNetMeasureTable is a reflection of the configuration of the 
   network measure. 
    
4.2.6   The ippmAggrMeasure Group  
    
   ippmAggrMeasureTable is responsible for the consolidation, or 
   aggregation, of results  previously measured and saved in the 
   ippmHistoryTable. The aggregated results are saved in the 
   ippmHistoryTable and may be used for higher aggregated measures.  
    
4.2.7   The Report Group  
    
   This group displays the existing reports of the measures collected. 
   The ippmReportSetupTable is responsible for the configuration of the 
   reports. 
   The reports are saved in the ippmReportTable, or sent directly to 
   management applications.  
    
    
4.2.8   The Notification Group  
    
   The Notification group specifies a list of valid notifications. They 
   are used to generate alarms, or reports, to management applications. 
    
4.3     Row identification in an application namespace 
    
   The control protocol, or the test protocol, adds rows in the 
   namespace of the corresponding measure. 
    
   An object instance identifier in an owner namespace is defined as a 
   list of objects in the clause INDEX where the first object type is 
   IppmOwnerString. 
    
   As the OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which identifies the instance, begins with 
   the owner value, the remaining values of the index fields may be 
   chosen independently from one namespace to another. 
    
   This allows the user to choose arbitrary values for the remaining 
   fields of the INDEX clause without checking that the values of these 
   fields exists in the MIB tables. This allows the owner to use the 
   same values across MIB implementations. 
    
   Thus, it avoids polling to determine the next free index. Also, as a 
   consequence, two applications will never find the same free index 
   value.

   The usage of owner namespace increases the speed of the management 
   operations while reducing bandwidth consumption and CPU load in the 
   agents and applications. 
    
   Measurements are requested by management applications. An instance of 
   an object managed by a management station is identified by the 
   management station IppmOwnerString and the private index provided by 
   the MS. 
    
4.4     Relationship of IPPM REPORTING MIB tables 
   There is inherently a relationship between various tables in the IPPM 
   REPORTING MIB, and as such, the data integrity must be assured. This 
   relationship is depicted in the following examples. 
    
4.4.1   Relationship between the Owners Table and the aggregated 
         measure table 
    
   The owners table contains the list of "owners" that can create and 
   activate remotely aggregated measures in an IPPM agent, or read the 
   existing network measures. 
    
   It is recommended to make use of "view based access control" in order 
   to restrict access to this table. For example, the master user 
   "administrator" may be given "write" privileges on the 
   ippmOwnersTable, whereas all others are restricted to "read" access.  
   The user "administrator" can then setup the list of other users that 
   have access to measures.  
    
   There must be at least 1 owner in the owners' table. This owner may 
   be either setup by default by the IPPM agent, or configured as stated 
   above. 
    
   An owner may have multiple corresponding entries in the network and 
   aggregated measure tables. Each entry in a measure table is 
   associated with one, and only one, entry in the owners' table. That 
   is to say, that a defined measure may NOT have multiple owners. 
 
   Thus, we have a 1:N relationship between the owners' table and a 
   measure table. 
    
 
4.4.2   Relationship between the Network Measure Table and the 
         Aggregated Measure Table 
    
   The network measure table is read-only, thus entries in this table 
   must be populated by the agent upon startup. 
   The agent could potentially read a database that contains network 
   measures configured by a 3rd party proprietary management system that 
   directly interacts with the points of measure. However, the "owner" 
   of the measure must be defined in the owners table. It may be either

   configured directly, or exported to the agent by the external 
   measurement tool.  
    
   The aggregated measure table allows for an "owner" to create 
   aggregated measures (such as average, minimum, maximum) on existing 
   measures. An owner may even create aggregated measures on network 
   measures that are owned by other owners. However, it is recommended 
   to use view based access control to grant access of network measures 
   to other owners in the system. 
 
5       Measurement architectures 
    
   There are three main measurement architectures. 
 
5.1     Proxy architecture

   .                      |     | 
   .           +----------+     +----------+ 
   .           |                           |

   .+----------------+              +------------------+ 
    
   In this architecture, the different NMS’s query the IPPM-REPORTING-
   MIB agent for measurements. The agent controls whether the NMS is 
   granted access to perform the measure requested. Each NMS may access 
   the results of its measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB history 
   table. 
    
   The measurement setup/teardown and the data collection are done using 
   the control protocol and the test protocol. 
 
   In this mode the NMS does not depend on the control protocol nor on 
   the test protocol. The entities involved in the measurement do not

   need to implement the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB nor SNMP. This mode allows 
   for lightweight implementation in the point of measure, and also for 
   heterogeneous control protocols to coexist. 
    
   Finally, the proxy is a checkpoint where measurement activity may be 
   logged, and where access to measurement setups may be tightly 
   controlled. Thus, it provides a reliable architecture to manage the 
   security of a measurement system. 
    
 
5.2     Reporting architecture 
    
   In this architecture the SNMP protocol is only used to read the 
   results of the measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History Table, 
   and also to inform the NMS that an event has occurred.

   The activation of a measure by the control protocol or the test 
   protocol creates a measure in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB Network Measure 
   table. The table in question may be not accessible by SNMP. In this 
   case, a list of the measure identifiers (owner, index) is handled by 
   the measurement software.

   Each timestamped result of the measure is logged in the IPPM-
   REPORTING-MIB History table in order to allow read access to the 
   NMS’s and event handling. 
    
   On completion, the measurement results are managed according to the 
   measure setup: 
       + The results may be sent to an NMS;  
       + They may be dropped from the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History table. 
    
   In this mode, it is recommended to use an SNMPv2 Inform PDU to send 
   reporting events because it ensures that the entire block of the 
   result is received. There is no control using SNMP Trap PDU.

   The NMS measurement queries are registered in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB 
   gateway and performed by the control and the test protocol. The NMS 
   directly consults the result in the corresponding IPPM REPORTING MIB 
   agent of the points of measure. 
 
5.4     Security 
 
   The proxy mode provides flexibility and control of the access to the 
   points of measure, while allowing lightweight control protocol and 
   test protocol implementations in the points of measure. Different 
   security rules may be applied to the NMS domain and to measurement 
   system domains.

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB               October 2003 
                                      
                                      
    
   The reporting mode has 2 security domains: 
    
       +  The control of the measurement setup relies on the control and 
       the test protocol security mechanisms; 
       +  The control of access to the results depends on the SNMP 
       security mechanisms such as community strings, but may also be 
       restricted using VACM for customized access. 
    
   The gateway mode security relies on the security of the proxy mode 
   and of the reporting mode. 
    
6       Reporting mode integration 
    
   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB standardizes the parameters that: 
    
       + Define the configuration of the IPPM metric measures; 
       + Define the format of the results of the measure; 
       + Define the report of the IPPM metric measure results. 
    
   It introduces the concept of owner namespace to allow for fast 
   configuration and reporting across multiple points of measurement.  
    
   A measure is a distributed object describing a task to be performed 
   by the control and the test protocols. A measure is identified by its 
   owner and its owner index. This identifier is the same in all the 
   points of measure. As the owner chooses the index, there is no need 
   for negotiation between the NMS and the points of measure before 
   activating the measure. 
    
   A measure is primarily defined by its identifier, the metrics to 
   measure, the description of the end point addresses and the 
   description of the scheduling of the measure. 
    
   The description of the measure is distributed to the points of 
   measure involved. The distribution may not be synchronized. 
 
6.1     Integration  
 
   The integration of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB, and the test and control 
   protocols consists in pushing the network measure setup/teardown 
   parameters and the result values from the measurement software to the 
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent. 
 
6.2     Setup of the measure network 
    
The measurement system updates the MIB on creation of a network measure.  
 
6.3     Setup of a measurement report

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB               October 2003 
                                      
                                      
   A measurement report setup describes events and data to include in 
   the report. A report is read by an NMS in the ippmReportTable, or 
   exported to an NMS using an SNMP trap, SNMP Inform PDU, an email, or 
   an SMS. 
    
   Different types of reports may be combined: 
    
       + A trivial report defines the results to be saved in the 
       ippmReportTable; 
       + A basic report defines the host to which the results are sent 
       on completion of the measure; 
       + An alarm report defines a threshold on the results of the 
       measure. A message is sent to a host when the result rises above, 
       or falls below the threshold; 
       + An SLA report defines a threshold on the results of the 
       measure. The report consists of the results of the measure (time 
       and value) of the filtered events. The reports are sent at each 
       measurement cycle, or when the measure completes. 
 
6.4     Updating the history of the MIB  
 
   Results have to be written by the measurement task in the agent 
   implementing the IPPM REPORTING MIB.  
    
   Adding the results of a measurement consists in the transfer of the 
   result from the measurement software to the SNMP agent. The protocol 
   that provides the result may be the control protocol, or the test 
   protocol, or another mechanism.  
    
6.5     Report download and upload 
    
   A report is read in the ippmReportTable using SNMP, or generated by 
   the IPPM_MIB agent using a SNMP Inform PDU, an email or a SMS. 
 
6.6     Default value 
    
   The default values correspond to IP version 4.

       This textual convention defines an octet string that gathers in a 
       bit string a sequence of bits. The bit order corresponds to the 
       order of the metric identifiers in the registry.  
       The first bit of the string has the index 0. The index 1 
       corresponds to the first metric of the registry 
       (instantaneousUnidirectionalConnectivity ).  
        
       Example:   
       One-way-Delay(6) is identified as the leaf number 6 of the node 
       rfc of the registry. One-way-Packet-Loss(12) is identified as the 
       leaf number 12 of the node  
       rfc of the registry. A network measure performing both One-way-
       Delay(6) and One-way-Packet-Loss(12) will be described as 
       '0000001000001000'b, '1040'B.

       * the value is in network-byte order 
        
       The timestamp format is directly inspired from the NTP timestamp 
       format. 
       It differs in that it counts the seconds since 1 Jan 2000 0H00 
       instead of 1 Jan 1900 0H00. The most significant bit of the part 
       that represents the second is reserved. It will wrap in year 2068 
       (The NTP timestamp will wrap in year 2036).  
        
       This bit is set to indicate if the fractional part of the second 
       contains a precision field and a synchronization field as 
       initially proposed in the OWAMP draft.  
        
       When this bit is not set, the resolution is maximal. 
        
       The maximal resolution is close to 250 picoseconds.  
        
       The precision of the timestamp must be provided in another field.

   STATUS       current 
   DESCRIPTION 
       "This textual convention is a display string used to describe the 
       protocol encapsulation list of a packet, and is used as the value 
       of the SYNTAX clause for the type of the Src and Dst of an IPPM 
       measure. The RFC2895 specifies a macro named PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER 
       for the definition of protocol identifiers, while its companion 
       document, the RFC2896 defines a set of protocol identifiers. 
        
       TypeP is defined as a display string. It consists of a list of 
       dot separated protocol names. Each protocol name has been 
       previously defined using the macro PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER of the RFC 
       2895. 
        
       Examples: 
       The RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers 'ether2', 'ip', 
       'ipip4', 'udp', 'tcp', 'telnet'... 
        
       The TypeP of the source address corresponding to telnet is the 
       string 'ip.tcp.telnet'. 
        
       The TypeP of the source address corresponding to UDP packets sent 
       in an IP tunnel is the string 'ip.ipip4.udp'. 
        
       Note:  
       An IPPM measure is active, so generally a TypeP value does not 
       describe the link layer (i.e. ether2...). Valid Internet packets 
       are sent from Src to Dst. Then the choice of the link layer 
       relies on the Internet stack."

   DESCRIPTION 
       "This textual convention is a Display string used to describe the

       basically the address. 
        
       TypePaddress is defined as a display string. It consists in a 
       list of blank separated addresses that reflect the encapsulation 
       of the TypeP. Each parameter in the list corresponds to a 
       parameter of a PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER of the TypeP. 
       Example: 
       The TypeP 'ip.ipip4' has 2 parameters. A valid TypePaddress value

   STATUS        current 
   DESCRIPTION 
   " A report definition is a list of statements describing a report. A 
   statement is part of this process if a corresponding bit in the 
   definition is set to '1'. For all bit values that are set to one, a 
   report will be generated. 
     
    
   The report process uses results saved in the history table. Threshold 
   values are provided by the report setup. 
    
       Given that not all results from a metric measurement are 
   pertinent to a particular report, and that the size of the report 
   must be limited whenever possible, the guidelines for the definition 
   of a report are as follows: 
    
       + Select the events for consideration (1); 
       + Configure filters to select pertinent values (2); 
       + Describe the way the report is delivered (3); 
       + Describe clean up actions to perform on report completion (4); 
    
   -1- events 
    
       Events determine when a report is processed. Events are 
       exclusive. The possible values are: 
        
       onSingleton: 
       The report is processed each time a new result of the measurement 
       occurs.  
        
       onMeasureCycle: 
       The report is processed each time a cycle of measure is 
       completed. 
        
       onMeasureCompletion: 
       The report is processed at the end of the measurement. 
    
   -2- filters 
       Filters determine if a result belongs to a report. 
       ReportInBandResults and ReportOutBandResults are exclusive. The 
       usage of ReportInBandResults and ReportOutBandResults exclude the 
       usage of ReportAboveResults and ReportBelowResults.  
       Possible values are: 
        
       reportUpAndDownResults: 
                Report contiguous results that are on opposite sides of 
                the up and down metric threshold.

                threshold field of the report setup.

                of the report setup. 
         
       reportExceededEventsDuration: 
                Save the results of the metric only if the current 
                filter triggers repeatedly for a series of contiguous 
                results during more than 
                ippmReportSetupDurationThreshold seconds. 
        
    
   -3- deliver 
    
       Even though report delivery statements are not exclusive, care 
       should be taken to limit the number of report methods to 2. The 
       delivery methods are: 
        
       inIppmReportTable: 
                Store the report in the local ippmReportTable.  
                NOTE WELL: Results are not stored in the report table if 
                this flag is not set. 
         
       inSNMPv2TrapPDU: 
                Send the report using a SNMPv2-Trap-PDU. 
        
       inInformRequestPDU: 
                Send the report using a SNMP InformRequest-PDU. 
        
       inEmail: 
                Send the report using an email.  
        
       inSMS:

       through the IPPM REPORTING MIB. As an example, OWAP provides a 
       setup protocol to setup and tear down networks measures. 
        
       The ippmNetMeasureMetrics is set to a list of metrics to be 
       computed from the same raw packet exchange. Each step of 
       measurement delivers a singleton per chosen metric. Results are 
       timestamped and saved in the ippmHistoryTable. 
        
       One may create aggregated measures by using the results of 
       network measures. They may be referenced by their table index

        A measure may be configured for the result of different metric 
       singletons to be archived in the ippmHistoryTable. The 
       ippmMetricIndex of the created result has the value of the bit 
       index of the corresponding ippmAggrMeasureMetrics as explained 
       above in the ippmMetricIndex definition. 
        
       Example: 
       A network measure asking for One-way-Delay(6) and One-way-Packet-
       Loss(12) generated a flow of singletons which are logged in the 
       ippmHistoryTable. The singletons created for the One-way-Delay 
       measure have a value of ippmMetricIndex of 6.The aggregated 
       measure definition(s) might be One-Way-Delay-Percentile(8),One-
       way-Delay-Median(9), or One-way-Delay-Minimum(10 .

   DESCRIPTION 
       "In order to properly define a report, one must provide 
       information to:  
          + Select the events to consider for reporting 
          + Configure filters to select pertinent values 
          + Describe the way the report is delivered 
          + Describe clean up actions to perform on report completion 
        
       The format of a report sent to a NMS is described in a 
       notification defined in the ippmNotifications node.  
 
       The event and the filter selected in the report definition 
       determine the notification: 
       + Up and Down filter report format is ippmUpAndDownReport; 
       + Inband filter report format is ippmInBandReport; 
       + Outband filter report format is ippmOutBandReport; 
       + Above filter report format is ippmAboveReport; 
       + Below filter report format is ippmBelowReport; 
       + Any filter and reportExceededEventsDuration report format is 
       ippmEventsDurationExceededReport; 
       + Any filter and the event onMeasureCompletion report format is 
       ippmCompletedMeasureReport; 
        
       Example 1: 
       Consider a report definition, which reports up and down result 
       events of a metric measure: 
        
       ippmReportSetupDefinition { 
                onSingleton, 
                reportUpAndDownMetricResults, 
                inSNMPv2TrapPDU 
       }

       The value of the threshold is given by

       Being a flow of results { 3.3 3.2 3.2 5.1 5.3 5.6 6.3 5.2 4.0 3.8

       Example 2: 
       Consider the report definition, which reports per measure cycle 
       in a SNMP informRequestPDU, up and down results events of a 
       metric measure: 
       : 
        
       ippmReportSetupDefinition { 
                onMeasureCycle, 
                reportUpAndDownMetricResults, 
                inInformRequestPDU 
       } 
        
        
       The value of the threshold is given by 
       ippmReportSetupUpDownThreshold. It has the value '5' in this 
       example. 
       The cycle of measure of the measure setup is set to 10 results. 
        
        
       Being a flow of 10 results { 3.3 3.2 3.2 5.1 5.3 5.6 6.3 5.2 4.0 
       3.8 ... }, the report process will send one InformRequestPDU that 
       carries 5.1 and 4.0 corresponding to the first down to up event 
       and to the second up to down event, respectively. "

8       Security Considerations 
    
8.1     VACM Access control 
    
   View Based Access Control, or VACM may be used to restrict access to 
   certain objects, or even object instances within tables. For example, 
   one may: 
    
   + Give an 'administrator' write access to the ippmOwnersTable, 
   whereas all other users may only have read access 
   + Give access to individual rows in the network measure, aggregated 
   measure, history, and report table to particular owners based upon 
   indexing on an 'owners name', and even upon a particular measure. 
   This will be illustrated below. 
   + Give access of one owner’s measure, and associated results, to 
   another owner in order to create an aggregated measure based upon the 
   results.  
    
8.1.1   Example of implementing VACM control for the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB 
    
   The following example illustrates how one could use VACM to restrict 
   access to particular objects within the MIB. It uses syntax specific

   to a particular agent development toolkit, but may be generalized 
   using the concepts as defined in the VACM MIB. 
    
   In this example, we have two NMS users, namely user1=owner1 and 
   user2=owner2: 
   1) First we define the two users and their host addresses: 
   com2sec              owner1  owner1computer@ private 
   com2sec              owner2  owner2computer@ private 
    
   2) We then define SNMPv2c groups 
   group                        owner1  v2c     owner1 
   group                        owner2  v2c     owner2 
   view notif           included        ippmNotifications       ff 
    
   3.1) For the user owner1, we now define the views for which he will 
   have read access

   access

8.2     Privacy 
    
   The privacy concerns of network measurement are intrinsically limited 
   by the active measurements. Unlike passive measurements, there can be 
   no release of existing user data.

8.3     Measurement aspects 
    
   Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy 
   concerns. This memo does not specify an implementation of the 
   metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet 
   nor of applications that run on the Internet. However, 
   implementations of these metrics must be mindful of security and 
   privacy concerns. 
     
    There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by 
   the measurements, and potential harm to the measurements. The 
   measurements could cause harm because they are active, and inject 
   packets into the network. The measurement parameters MUST be 
   carefully selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of 
   additional traffic into the networks they measure. If they inject 
   "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and 
   in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service. 
     
    The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving 
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by 
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic. If routers can 
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the 
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic. If an attacker 
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss 
   rate will be artificially lowered. Therefore, the measurement 
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the 
   probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal" 
   traffic.  
    
   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used 
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks. 
     
 
8.4     Management aspects 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-only. Such objects 
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
 
    SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  
     
    It is recommended that the implementors consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use

   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [21] is recommended.  
     
    It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.
