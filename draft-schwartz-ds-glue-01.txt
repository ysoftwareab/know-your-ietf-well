2.  Background

   The DPRIVE working group has been pursuing designs for authenticated
   encryption of recursive-to-authoritative communication.  Recursive
   resolvers could enable authenticated encryption most easily and
   efficiently if they received authenticated information about the
   target nameserver's configuration during the in-bailiwick delegation
   that precedes the direct connection.  However, there are several
   obstacles to this.

2.1.  Obstacle 1: Authentication

   Glue records in DNS referral responses are unauthenticated.  Parents
   do not generally provide RRSIGs for these records in their responses,
   and resolvers do not expect such signatures to be present.  An in-
   path attacker can modify or remove records in the delegation response
   without detection.

   If the parent zone also implements authenticated encryption, this
   provides sufficient protection for the glue records, but many
   important parent zones seem unlikely to implement authenticated
   encryption in the near future.

2.2.  Obstacle 2: Flexibility

   Existing nameserver deployments assume that the delegation response
   includes only a fixed set of existing RR types (NS, A, AAAA, DS,
   RRSIG, etc.).  These systems are slow to upgrade, and the working
   group would like to be able to begin deploying authenticated
   encryption without first requiring a significant change in these
   parents.

3.  Proposal

   This draft proposes a way to convey glue RRs in DS records, enabling
   authenticated delivery of arbitrary RR types as part of the
   delegation response.

   There are three main records involved in this process:

   *  A Source Record to be conveyed, which may be of any RR type and
      anywhere below the zone cut.

   *  A Virtual DNSKEY Record encapsulating the Source Record.

   *  The DSGLUE Record, a DS record derived from the Virtual DNSKEY
      Record and published in the parent.

3.1.  Encoding

   To encode a Source Record, a zone operator first transforms it into a
   Virtual DNSKEY Record as follows:

   *  Owner Name = The Owner Name of the Source Record relative to the
      child zone apex.

   *  Flags = 0x0001, i.e. only SEP (bit 15) is set.

   *  Protocol = 3

   *  Algorithm = DS Glue (see IANA registration in Section 7)

   *  Public Key = The RR type and canonicalized RDATA of the Source
      Record ([RFC4034], Section 6.2).

   For example, these Source Records:

   $ORIGIN example.com.
   @ 3600 IN NS ns1
          IN NS ns2
          IN NS NS.OTHER.EXAMPLE.

   would be represented as the following Virtual DNSKEY Records:

   ; Public Key = \000\002 \003ns1\007example\003com\000
   . 300 IN DNSKEY 1 3 $DSGLUE_NUM AAIDbnMxB2V4YW1wbGUDY29tAA==
   ; Public Key = \000\002 \003ns2\007example\003com\000
   . 300 IN DNSKEY 1 3 $DSGLUE_NUM AAIDbnMyB2V4YW1wbGUDY29tAA==
   ; Public Key = \000\002 \002ns\005other\007example\000
   . 300 IN DNSKEY 1 3 $DSGLUE_NUM AAICbnMFb3RoZXIHZXhhbXBsZQA=

   Note that:

   *  The NS Source Records are "real" records that appear in
      authoritative Answers and/or delegation glue, but the DNSKEY
      records are "virtual records" because they do not appear in any
      zone or response (in this form).

   *  The Virtual DNSKEY Records' owner name is "." because the Source
      Records appear at the zone apex.

   *  The NS RDATA has been converted to lowercase as specified by the
      canonicalization algorithm.

Internet-Draft                   DS Glue                     August 2021


   Having constructed a Virtual DNSKEY Record, the DSGLUE Record is
   constructed as usual, but always using the VERBATIM digest type
   [I-D.draft-vandijk-dnsop-ds-digest-verbatim].  Thus, the DSGLUE
   Record's wire format RDATA forms the following concatenation:

   Key Tag | Algorithm = DSGLUE | Digest Type = VERBATIM | Digest = (
     DNSKEY owner name = name prefix | DNSKEY RDATA = (
       Flags = 1 | Protocol = 3 | Algorithm = DSGLUE | Public Key = (
         RR Type | RDATA
       )
     )
   )

   The DSGLUE record is a real DS record that appears in the usual DS
   RRSet, whose owner name is the child apex.

      QUESTION: Should we skip the virtual DNSKEY record, and construct
      the fake DS directly?  This would save 4-6 bytes per RR, but would
      lose the ability to reuse DNSKEY->DS construction codepaths
      (unchanged except for a new digest type).

3.2.  Interpretation

   Upon receiving a delegation response, resolvers implementing this
   specification SHALL compute the Adjusted Delegation Response as
   follows:

   1.  Copy the delegation response.

   2.  Reverse the encoding process of any DSGLUE records to reconstruct
       the source RRSets, all carrying the TTL of the DS RRSet.

   3.  Add each of these reconstructed RRSets to the Adjusted Delegation
       Response, replacing any RRSet with the same owner name and type.

   Resolution then proceeds as usual, using the Adjusted Delegation
   Response.  When processing the DS RRSet, the recipient will verify
   the DS RRSIGs as usual, and abort the resolution as Bogus if DNSSEC
   validation fails.

   Resolvers that do not implement this specification will ignore the
   DSGLUE records due to the unrecognized algorithm.  Thus, these
   records are safe to use for both signed and unsigned child zones.

   Source Records reconstructed from DSGLUE SHOULD be processed exactly
   like ordinary unauthenticated glue records.  For example, they MAY be
   cached for use in future delegations but MUST NOT be returned in any
   responses (c.f.  Section 5.4.1 of [RFC2181]).

3.3.  Special case: RR Type = NSEC or NSEC3

   Normally, the absence of a particular record in a delegation response
   is not informative to a resolver.  The corresponding record might
   still exist in the child zone.  To inform the resolver that a
   particular RRSet is nonexistent for the purposes of delegation, the
   zone owner MAY place an NSEC or NSEC3 record in the delegation
   response.

   As with other glue records, an NSEC glue record only affects behavior
   during delegation following (see example in Section 4.3).

4.  Examples

   For these examples, the macro "$DSGLUE(prefix, source RR type, source
   RDATA)" constructs a DSGLUE DS record as described in Section 3.1.

4.1.  Out-of-bailiwick referral

   An out-of-bailiwick referral contains only NS records, e.g.

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 3600 IN NS ns1.example.net.
                IN NS ns2.example.net.

   These Source Records would be encoded in DSGLUE as:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 3600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.net.)
                IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns2.example.net.)

4.2.  In-bailiwick referral

   An in-bailiwick referral contains NS records and at least one kind of
   address record.

   $ORIGIN com.
   example    3600 IN NS    ns1.example
                   IN NS    ns2.example
   ns1.example 600 IN A     192.0.2.1
                   IN AAAA  2001:db8::1
   ns2.example 600 IN A     192.0.2.2
                   IN AAAA  2001:db8::2

   These records would be encoded in DSGLUE as:

Internet-Draft                   DS Glue                     August 2021


   $ORIGIN com.
   example 600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns2.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., A, 192.0.2.1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., AAAA, 2001:db8::1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns2., A, 192.0.2.1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns2., AAAA, 2001:db8::2)

   Note that the differing TTL between RRSets is lost.

4.3.  In-bailiwick referral without IPv4

   Consider a delegation to a nameserver that is only reachable with
   IPv6:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example    3600 IN NS    ns1.example
   ns1.example 600 IN AAAA  2001:db8::1

   A zone in this configuration can optionally use an NSEC DSGLUE record
   to indicate that there is no IPv4 address:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., AAAA, 2001:db8::1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., NSEC, ns1.example.com. AAAA)

   This arrangement prevents an adversary from inserting forged records
   for ns1.example.com or _dns.ns1.example.com into the delegation
   response.

   Note that although there is an NSEC record denying the existence of A
   records for ns1.example.com, it is treated as a glue record that only
   applies during delegation, so such records can still be resolved if
   they exist.

4.4.  Delegation with authenticated encryption

   Assuming a SVCB-based signaling mechanism similar to
   [I-D.draft-schwartz-svcb-dns], an in-bailiwick referral with support
   for authenticated encryption is indicated as follows:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., A, 192.0.2.1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., AAAA, 2001:db8::1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(_dns.ns1., SVCB,
                             1 ns1.example.com. alpn=dot)

4.4.1.  Disabling DANE

   Resolvers check whether a nameserver supports DANE by resolving a
   TLSA record during the delegation process (Section 6.3).  However,
   this adds unnecessary latency to the delegation if the nameserver
   does not implement DANE.  As an optimization, such nameservers can
   add NSEC records to indicate that there is no such TLSA record, e.g.:

   IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., NSEC, _dns.ns1.example.com. A AAAA)
   IN DS $DSGLUE(_dns.ns1., NSEC, ns1.example.com. SVCB)

5.  Security Considerations

   Resolvers that process DSGLUE MUST perform DNSSEC validation.

   Source Records published as DSGLUE have owner names within the child
   zone, but are signed only by the parent.  This makes them fully
   authenticated, but provides different cryptographic guarantees than a
   direct signature by the child.  For example, these records might not
   appear in any key use logs maintained by the child.

6.  Operational Considerations

6.1.  Publishing DSGLUE records

   In order for the child to publish DSGLUE records, the parent must
   allow the child to publish arbitrary DS records or have specific
   support for this specification.

   If the parent supports CDS [RFC8078], child zones MAY use CDS to push
   DSGLUE records into the parent.  Note that CDNSKEY records cannot be
   used, because (1) the child cannot publish CDNSKEY records with the
   required owner name and (2) the child cannot guarantee that the
   parent will use the VERBATIM digest to produce the DS record.

   Child zones SHOULD publish all Source Records as ordinary records of
   the specified type at the indicated owner name, in order to enable
   revalidation [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation] and simplify
   debugging.

6.2.  Referral response size

   When records are present in both ordinary glue and DSGLUE, the
   response size is approximately doubled.  This could cause performance
   issues due to response truncation when the initial query is over UDP.

6.3.  PKI and DANE for Authenticated Encryption

      TODO: Move some of this text into a different draft.

   Nameservers supporting authenticated encryption MAY indicate any DANE
   mode, or none at all.

   As an optimization, nameservers using DANE MAY place a TLSA record in
   the DSGLUE to avoid the latency of a TLSA lookup during delegation.
   However, child zones should be aware that this adds complexity and
   delay to the process of TLSA key rotation.

   Nameservers that do not support DANE SHOULD add an NSEC or NSEC3
   record denying the TLSA record to the DSGLUE, as shown in
   Section 4.4.1, to avoid an unnecessary delay.

   Resolvers that support authenticated encryption MAY implement support
   for PKI-based authentication, DANE, or both.  PKI-only resolvers MUST
   nonetheless resolve TLSA records, and MUST NOT require authentication
   if the DANE mode is DANE-TA(2) or DANE-EE(3) [RFC7671].  DANE-only
   resolvers MUST NOT require authentication if the TLSA record does not
   exist.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new entry to the DNS Security Algorithm
   Numbers registry:

   +=============+===============+==========+=======+======+===========+
   | Number      | Description   | Mnemonic |Zone   |Trans.| Reference |
