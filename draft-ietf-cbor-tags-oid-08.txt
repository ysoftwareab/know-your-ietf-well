Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Object Identifiers
                      draft-ietf-cbor-tags-oid-08

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   The present document defines CBOR tags for object identifiers (OIDs).
   It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of
   the CBOR tags so defined.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, [RFC8949]) provides
   for the interchange of structured data without a requirement for a
   pre-agreed schema.  [RFC8949] defines a basic set of data types, as
   well as a tagging mechanism that enables extending the set of data
   types supported via an IANA registry.

   The present document defines CBOR tags for object identifiers (OIDs,
   [X.660]), which many IETF protocols carry.  The ASN.1 Basic Encoding
   Rules (BER, [X.690]) specify binary encodings of both (absolute)
   object identifiers and relative object identifiers.  The contents of
   these encodings (the "value" part of BER's type-length-value
   structure) can be carried in a CBOR byte string.  This document
   defines two CBOR tags that cover the two kinds of ASN.1 object
   identifiers encoded in this way, and a third one to enable a common
   optimization.  The tags can also be applied to arrays and maps to
   efficiently tag all elements of an array or all keys of a map.  It is
   intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the
   tags so defined.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology of [RFC8949] applies; in particular the term "byte"
   is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for "octet".  The
   verb "to tag (something)" is used to express the construction of a
   CBOR tag with the object (something) as the tag content and a tag
   number indicated elsewhere in the sentence (for instance in a "with"
   clause, or by the shorthand "an NNN tag" for "a tag with tag number
   NNN").  The term "SDNV" (Self-Delimiting Numeric Value) is used as
   defined in [RFC6256], with the additional restriction detailed in
   Section 2.1 (no leading zeros).

2.  Object Identifiers

   The International Object Identifier tree [X.660] is a hierarchically
   managed space of identifiers, each of which is uniquely represented
   as a sequence of unsigned integer values [X.680].  (These integer
   values are called "primary integer values" in X.660 because they can
   be accompanied by (not necessarily unambiguous) secondary
   identifiers.  We ignore the latter and simply use the term "integer
   values" here, occasionally calling out their unsignedness.  We also
   use the term "arc" when the focus is on the edge of the tree labeled
   by such an integer value, as well as in the sense of a "long arc",
   i.e., a (sub)sequence of such integer values.)

   While these sequences can easily be represented in CBOR arrays of
   unsigned integers, a more compact representation can often be
   achieved by adopting the widely used representation of object
   identifiers defined in BER; this representation may also be more
   amenable to processing by other software that makes use of object
   identifiers.

   BER represents the sequence of unsigned integers by concatenating
   self-delimiting [RFC6256] representations of each of the integer
   values in sequence.

   ASN.1 distinguishes absolute object identifiers (ASN.1 Type "OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER"), which begin at a root arc ([X.660] Clause 3.5.21), from
   relative object identifiers (ASN.1 Type "RELATIVE-OID"), which begin
   relative to some object identifier known from context ([X.680] Clause
   3.8.63).  As a special optimization, BER combines the first two
   integers in an absolute object identifier into one numeric identifier
   by making use of the property of the hierarchy that the first arc has
   only three integer values (0, 1, and 2), and the second arcs under 0
   and 1 are limited to the integer values between 0 and 39.  (The root
   arc "joint-iso-itu-t(2)" has no such limitations on its second arc.)
   If X and Y are the first two integer values, the single integer value
   actually encoded is computed as:

      X * 40 + Y

   The inverse transformation (again making use of the known ranges of X
   and Y) is applied when decoding the object identifier.

   Since the semantics of absolute and relative object identifiers
   differ, and it is very common for companies to use self-assigned
   numbers under the arc "1.3.6.1.4.1" (IANA Private Enterprise Number
   OID, [IANA.enterprise-numbers]) that adds 5 fixed bytes to an encoded
   OID value, this specification defines three tags, collectively called
   the "OID tags" here:

   Tag number TBD111: used to tag a byte string as the [X.690] encoding
   of an absolute object identifier (simply "object identifier" or
   "OID").

   Tag number TBD110: used to tag a byte string as the [X.690] encoding
   of a relative object identifier (also "relative OID").  Since the
   encoding of each number is the same as for [RFC6256] Self-Delimiting
   Numeric Values (SDNVs), this tag can also be used for tagging a byte
   string that contains a sequence of zero or more SDNVs (or a more
   application-specific tag can be created for such an application).

   Tag TBD112: structurally like TBD110, but understood to be relative
   to "1.3.6.1.4.1" (IANA Private Enterprise Number OID,
   [IANA.enterprise-numbers]).  Hence, the semantics of the result are
   that of an absolute object identifier.

2.1.  Requirements on the byte string being tagged

   To form a valid tag, a byte string tagged with TBD111, TBD110, or
   TBD112 MUST be syntactically valid contents (the value part) for a
   BER representation of an object identifier (Sections 8.19, 8.20, and
   8.20 of [X.690], respectively): A concatenation of zero or more SDNV
   values, where each SDNV value is a sequence of one or more bytes that
   all have their most significant bit set, except for the last byte,
   where it is unset.  Also, the first byte of each SDNV cannot be a
   leading zero in SDNV's base-128 arithmetic, so it cannot take the
   value 0x80 (bullet (c) in Section 8.1.2.4.2 of [X.690]).

   In other words:

   *  the byte string's first byte, and any byte that follows a byte
      that has the most significant bit unset, MUST NOT be 0x80 (this
      requirement requires expressing the integer values in their
      shortest form, with no leading zeroes)

   *  the byte string's last byte MUST NOT have the most significant bit
      set (this requirement excludes an incomplete final integer value)

   If either of these invalid conditions are encountered, the tag is
   invalid.

   [X.680] restricts RELATIVE-OID values to have at least one arc, i.e.,
   their encoding would have at least one SDNV.  This specification
   permits empty relative object identifiers; they may still be excluded
   by application semantics.

Internet-Draft             CBOR Tags for OIDs                   May 2021


   To facilitate the search for specific object ID values, it is
   RECOMMENDED that definite length encoding (see Section 3.2.3 of
   [RFC8949]) is used for the byte strings used as tag content for these
   tags.

   The valid set of byte strings can also be expressed using regular
   expressions on bytes, using no specific notation but resembling
   [PCRE].  Unlike typical regular expressions that operate on character
   sequences, the following regular expressions take bytes as their
   domain, so they can be applied directly to CBOR byte strings.

   For byte strings with tag TBD111:

      "/^(([\x81-\xFF][\x80-\xFF]*)?[\x00-\x7F])+$/"

   For byte strings with tag TBD110 or TBD112:

      "/^(([\x81-\xFF][\x80-\xFF]*)?[\x00-\x7F])*$/"

   A tag with tagged content that does not conform to the applicable
   regular expression is invalid.

2.2.  Preferred Serialization Considerations

   For an absolute OID with a prefix of "1.3.6.1.4.1", representations
   with both the TBD111 and TBD112 tags are applicable, where the
   representation with TBD112 will be five bytes shorter (by leaving out
   the prefix h'2b06010401' from the enclosed byte string).  This
   specification makes that shorter representation the preferred
   serialization (see Sections 3.4 and 4.1 of [RFC8949]).  Note that
   this also implies that the Core Deterministic Encoding Requirements
   (Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949]) require the use of TBD112 tags instead
   of TBD111 wherever that is possible.

2.3.  Discussion

   Staying close to the way object identifiers are encoded in ASN.1 BER
   makes back-and-forth translation easy; otherwise we would choose a
   more efficient encoding.  Object identifiers in IETF protocols are
   serialized in dotted decimal form or BER form, so there is an
   advantage in not inventing a third form.  Also, expectations of the
   cost of encoding object identifiers are based on BER; using a
   different encoding might not be aligned with these expectations.  If
   additional information about an OID is desired, lookup services such
   as the OID Resolution Service (ORS) [X.672] and the OID Repository
   [OID-INFO] are available.

3.  Basic Examples

   This section gives simple examples of an absolute and a relative
   object identifier, represented via tag number TBD111 and TBD110,
   respectively.

   RFC editor: These and other examples assume the allocation of 111 for
   TBD111 and 110 for TBD110 and need to be changed if that isn't the
   actual allocation.  Please remove this paragraph.

             Figure 4: MIB relative object identifier, in CBOR

   This relative OID saves seven bytes compared to the full OID
   encoding.

4.  Tag Factoring with Arrays and Maps

   The tag content of OID tags can be byte strings (as discussed above),
   but also CBOR arrays and maps.  The idea in the latter case is that
   the tag construct is factored out from each individual item in the
   container; the tag is placed on the array or map instead.

   When the tag content of an OID tag is an array, this means that the
   respective tag is imputed to all elements of the array that are byte
   strings, arrays, or maps.  (There is no effect on other elements,
   including text strings or tags.)  For example, when the tag content
   of a TBD111 tag is an array, every array element that is a byte
   string is an OID, and every element that is an array or map is in
   turn treated as discussed here.

   When the tag content of an OID tag is a map, this means that a tag
   with the same tag number is imputed to all keys in the map that are
   byte strings, arrays, or maps; again, there is no effect on keys of
   other major types.  Note that there is also no effect on the values
   in the map.

   As a result of these rules, tag factoring in nested arrays and maps
   is supported.  For example, a 3-dimensional array of OIDs can be
   composed by using a single TBD111 tag containing an array of arrays
   of arrays of byte strings.  All such byte strings are then considered
   OIDs.

4.1.  Preferred Serialization Considerations

   Where tag factoring with tag number TBD111 is used, some OIDs
   enclosed in the tag may be encoded in a shorter way by using tag
   number TBD112 instead of encoding an unadorned byte string.  This
   remains the preferred serialization (see also Section 2.2).  However,
   this specification does not make the presence or absence of tag
   factoring a preferred serialization; application protocols can define
   where tag factoring is to be used or not (and will need to do so if
   they have deterministic encoding requirements).

   Table 1 has four "relative distinguished names" (RDNs).  The country

   (This example encoding assumes that all attribute values are UTF-8
   strings, or can be represented as UTF-8 strings with no loss of
   information.)

5.  CDDL Control Operators

   Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL [RFC8610]) specifications may
   want to specify the use of SDNVs or SDNV sequences (as defined for
   the tag content for TBD110).  This document introduces two new
   control operators that can be applied to a target value that is a
   byte string:

   *  ".sdnv", with a control type that contains unsigned integers.  The
      byte string is specified to be encoded as an [RFC6256] SDNV (BER
      encoding) for the matching values of the control type.






Bormann                 Expires 22 November 2021               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             CBOR Tags for OIDs                   May 2021


   *  ".sdnvseq", with a control type that contains arrays of unsigned
      integers.  The byte string is specified to be encoded as a
      sequence of [RFC6256] SDNVs (BER encoding) that decodes to an
      array of unsigned integers matching the control type.

   *  ".oid", like ".sdnvseq", except that the X*40+Y translation for
      absolute OIDs is included (see Figure 8).

   Figure 7 shows an example for the use of ".sdnvseq" for a part of a
   structure using OIDs that could be used in Figure 6; Figure 8 shows
   the same with the ".oid" operator.

   country-rdn = {country-oid => country-value}
   country-oid = bytes .sdnvseq [85, 4, 6]
   country-value = text .size 2

                          Figure 7: Using .sdnvseq

   country-rdn = {country-oid => country-value}
   country-oid = bytes .oid [2, 5, 4, 6]
   country-value = text .size 2

                            Figure 8: Using .oid

   Note that the control type need not be a literal; e.g., "bytes .oid
   [2, 5, 4, *uint]" matches all OIDs inside OID arc 2.5.4,
   "attributeType".

6.  CDDL typenames

   For the use with CDDL, the typenames defined in Figure 9 are
   recommended:

   oid = #6.111(bstr)
   roid = #6.110(bstr)
   pen = #6.112(bstr)

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8949] apply.

   The encodings in Clauses 8.19 and 8.20 of [X.690] are quite compact
   and unambiguous, but MUST be followed precisely to avoid security
   pitfalls.  In particular, the requirements set out in Section 2.1 of
   this document need to be followed; otherwise, an attacker may be able
   to subvert a checking process by submitting alternative
   representations that are later taken as the original (or even
   something else entirely) by another decoder supposed to be protected
   by the checking process.

   OIDs and relative OIDs can always be treated as opaque byte strings.
   Actually understanding the structure that was used for generating
   them is not necessary, and, except for checking the structure
   requirements, it is strongly NOT RECOMMENDED to perform any
   processing of this kind (e.g., converting into dotted notation and
   back) unless absolutely necessary.  If the OIDs are translated into
   other representations, the usual security considerations for non-
   trivial representation conversions apply; the integer values are
   unlimited in range.

   An attacker might trick an application into using a byte string
   inside a tag-factored data item, where the byte string is not
   actually intended to fall under one of the tags defined here.  This
   may cause the application to emit data with semantics different from
   what was intended.  Applications therefore need to be restrictive
   with respect to what data items they apply tag factoring to.

A.8.  Changes from -07 (bormann) to -00 (ietf)

   Resubmitted as WG draft after adoption.

A.9.  Changes from -06 to -07

   Reduce the draft back to its basic mandate: Describe CBOR tags for
   what is colloquially know as ASN.1 Object IDs.

A.10.  Changes from -05 to -06

   Refreshed the draft to the current date ("keep-alive").

A.11.  Changes from -04 to -05

   Discussed UUID usage in CBOR, and incorporated fixes proposed by
   Olivier Dubuisson, including fixes regarding OID nomenclature.

A.12.  Changes from -03 to -04

   Changes occurred based on limited feedback, mainly centered around
   the abstract and introduction, rather than substantive technical
   changes.  These changes include:

   *  Changed the title so that it is about tags and techniques.

   *  Rewrote the abstract to describe the content more accurately, and
      to point out that no changes to the wire protocol are being
      proposed.

   *  Removed "ASN.1" from "object identifiers", as OIDs are independent
      of ASN.1.

   *  Rewrote the introduction to be more about the present text.

   *  Proposed a concise OID arc.

   *  Provided binary regular expression forms for OID validation.

   *  Updated IANA registration tables.

A.13.  Changes from -02 to -03

   Many significant changes occurred in this version.  These changes
   include:

   *  Expanded the draft scope to be a comprehensive CBOR update.
