Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based monitoring and management of an internet Storage Name Service
  (iSNS).

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to
   the SMIv2.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework
   and existing SNMP standards.

   This memo is a product of the IP Storage (IPS) working group within
   the Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and
   should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at
   ips@ece.cmu.edu and/or the authors.

1.  Introduction

   The iSNS Internet Storage Name Service defines a mechanism for IP
   based storage devices to register and query for other storage
   devices in the network.  This draft specifies the MIB objects for
   managing iSNS servers.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no

   Internet Draft              iSNS MIB                      July 2001


   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB.

3.  Overview

   The iSNS protocol can be used by IP based storage devices for
   dynamic registration and discovery of storage devices in the network
   [isns001].  It also has the capability to group devices into storage
   discovery domains.  The iSNS MIB is designed to allow SNMP to be
   used to monitor and manage a server used to provide iSNS
   capabilities.

4.  Technical Description

   The MIB is divided into several sections for Discovery Domain Set,
   Discovery Domain management, registered object management, and iSNS
   control.

4.1  Discovery Domain Set

   The isnsDds section provides information on the registered Discovery
   Domain Sets, and the DDS members.  DDSs is a method to group
   registered Discovery Domains.

4.2  Discovery Domain

   The isnsDd section provides information on the registered Discovery
   Domains, and the DD members.  DD members can be iSCSI nodes or iFCP
   nodes.

4.3  Registered Storage Objects

   The isnsReg section provides information on the registered storage
   objects.

4.3.1  Registered Entities

   The isnsRegEntityInfo section provides information on the registered
   entities.  Entities are collection of storage nodes and portals.

4.3.2  Registered Portals

   The isnsRegPortalInfo section provides information on the registered
   portals.  Portals are logical IP-Address, TCP/UDP Port pairs that
   provide access to storage nodes.

4.3.3  Registered iSCSI Nodes

   The isnsRegIsciNodeInfo section provides information on the
   registered iSCSI Nodes. The iSCSI nodes are individual storage

   targets or initiators.

4.3.4  Registered iFCP Nodes

   The isnsRegIfcpNodeInfo section provides information on the
   registered iFCP Nodes. The iFCP nodes are ports to individual
   storage devices.

4.3.5  Registered FC Nodes

   The isnsRegFcNodeInfo section provides information on the registered
   FC Nodes. The FC nodes are individual storage devices.

4.4  iSNS Control

   The isnsCntl section the ability to monitor and manage an iSNS
   instance.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
