   Abstract 
    
   This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6 
   addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is 
   known as Address Resolution (AR), or Neighbour Discovery (ND). Such 
   address resolution complements the higher layer resource discovery 
   tools that are used to advertise IP sessions.  
    
   In MPEG-2 Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet 
   ID (PID) value and a specific Transmission Multiplex. The document 
   reviews current methods. It also describes the interaction with 
   well-known protocols for address management including DHCP, ARP, and 
   the ND protocol, and provides guidance on usage.

INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks               Feb 2006  
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   The MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) provides a time-division 
   multiplexed (TDM) stream that may contain audio, video and data 
   information, including encapsulated IP Datagrams [RFC4259].  It is 
   defined in specification ISO/IEC 138181 [ISO-MPEG2]. Each Layer-2 
   frame, known as a TS Packet, contains a 4 byte header and a 184 byte 
   payload.  Each TS Packet is associated with a single TS Logical 
   Channel, identified by a 13-bit Packet ID (PID) value that is 
   carried in the MPEG-2 TS Packet header.   
    
   The MPEG-2 standard also defines a control plane that may be used to 
   transmit control information to Receivers in the form of System 
   Information (SI) Tables [ETSI-SI, ETSI-SI1], or Program Specific 
   Information (PSI) Tables.  
    
   To utilize the MPEG-2 TS as an IP link, a sender must associate an 
   IP address with a particular Transmission Multiplex, and within the 
   multiplex identify the specific PID to be used. This document calls 
   this mapping Address Resolution (AR). In some AR schemes, the MPEG-2 
   TS address space is sub-divided into logical contexts known as 
   Platforms. Each Platform associates an IP service provider with a 
   separate context that share a common MPEG-2 TS (use the same PID 
   value).  
    
   MPEG-2 Receivers may use a Network Point of Attachment (NPA) 
   [RFC4259] to uniquely identify the L2 node within an MPEG-2 
   transmission network. An example of an NPA is the IEEE Medium Access 
   Control (MAC) address. Where such addresses are used, these must 
   also be signaled by the AR procedure. Finally, address resolution 
   could signal the format of the data being transmitted, for example, 
   the encapsulation, any L2 encryption method and any compression 
   scheme [RFC4259].  
    
   The numbers of Receivers connected via a single MPEG-2 link may be 
   much larger than found in other common LAN technologies, (e.g. 
   Ethernet).  This has implications on design/configuration of the 
   address resolution mechanisms. Current routing protocols, and some 
   multicast application protocols also do not scale to arbitrary large 
   numbers of participants. Such networks do not by themselves 
   introduce an appreciable subnetwork round trip delay, however many 
   practical MPEG-2 transmission networks are built using links that 
   may introduce significant path delay (satellite links, use of dial-
   up modem return, cellular return, etc). This higher delay may need 
   to be accommodated for in the design of protocols that use this 
   service. 
    
   The remainder of the document describes current mechanisms and their 
   use to associate an IP address with the corresponding TS Multiplex, 
   PID value, the NPA/MAC address and/or Platform ID. A range of 
   approaches is described, including Layer-2 methods (using MPEG-2 SI 
   tables), and protocols at the IP level (including the IPv4 Address 
   Resolution Protocol, ARP [RFC826] and the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

   Section is sent in a series of TS Packets using a single Stream (TS 
   Logical Channel).  
        
   MPEG-2: A set of standards specified by the Motion Picture Experts  
   Group (MPEG), and standardized by the International Standards  
   Organisation (ISO/IEC 113818-1) [ISO-MPEG2], and ITU-T (in H.220).  
 
   NPA: Network Point of Attachment. In this document, refers to a 6  
   byte destination address (resembling an IEEE MAC address) within the  
   MPEG-2 transmission network that is used to identify individual  
   Receivers or groups of Receivers [RFC4259].   
    
   PAT: Program Association Table. An MPEG-2 PSI control table. It 
   associates each program with the PID value that is used to send the 
   associated PMT. The table is sent using the well-known PID value of 
   0x000, and is required for an MPEG-2 compliant Transport Stream. 
    
   PDU: Protocol Data Unit.  Examples of a PDU include Ethernet frames, 
   IPv4 or IPv6 Datagrams, and other network packets. 
    
   PID: Packet Identifier  [ISO-MPEG2]. A 13 bit field carried in the  
   header of each TS Packet. This identifies the TS Logical Channel to 
   which a TS Packet belongs [ISO-MPEG2]. The TS Packets that form the 
   parts of a Table Section, or other Payload Unit must all carry the 
   same PID value.  The all ones PID value indicates a Null TS Packet 
   introduced to maintain a constant bit rate of a TS Multiplex. There 
   is no required relationship between the PID values used for TS 
   Logical Channels transmitted using different TS Multiplexes. 
    
   PMT: Program Map Table. An MPEG-2 PSI control table that associates 
   the PID values used by the set of TS Logical Channels/ Streams that 
   comprise a program [ISO-MPEG2]. The PID value used to send the PMT 
   for a specific program is defined by an entry in the PAT. 
      
   Private Section: A syntactic structure constructed according to 
   Table 2-30 of [ISO-MPEG2]. The structure may be used to identify 
   private information (i.e. not defined by [ISO-MPEG2]) relating to 
   one or more elementary streams, or a specific MPEG-2 program, or the 
   entire Transport Stream.  Other Standards bodies, e.g. ETSI, ATSC, 
   have defined sets of table structures using the private_section 
   structure. A Private Section is transmitted as a sequence of TS 
   Packets using a TS Logical Channel. A TS Logical Channel may carry 
   sections from more than one set of tables.  
        
   PSI: Program Specific Information [ISO-MPEG2]. PSI is used to convey 
   information about services carried in a TS Multiplex. It is carried 
   in one of four specifically identified table section constructs 
   [ISO-MPEG2], see also SI Table. 
    
   Receiver: Equipment that processes the signal from a TS Multiplex 
   and performs filtering and forwarding of encapsulated PDUs to the 
   network-layer service (or bridging module when operating at the 
   link-layer).

   SI Table: Service Information Table [ISO-MPEG2]. In this document, 
   this term describes a table that is been defined by another 
   standards body to convey information about the services carried in a 
   TS Multiplex. A Table may consist of one or more Table Sections, 
   however, all sections of a particular SI Table must be carried over 
   a single TS Logical Channel [ISO-MPEG2].  
     
   SNDU: Subnetwork Data Unit. An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2  
   Payload Unit.  
    
   STB: Set-Top Box.  A consumer equipment (Receiver) for reception of 
   digital TV services. 
        
   Table Section: A Payload Unit carrying all or a part of an SI or PSI  
   Table [ISO-MPEG2].  
        
   TS: Transport Stream [ISO-MPEG2], a method of transmission at the  
   MPEG-2 level using TS Packets; it represents layer 2 of the ISO/OSI  
   reference model. See also TS Logical Channel and TS Multiplex.  
    
   TS Logical Channel: Transport Stream Logical Channel. In this 
   document, this term identifies a channel at the MPEG-2 level [ISO-
   MPEG2]. This exists at level 2 of the ISO/OSI reference model. All 
   packets sent over a TS Logical Channel carry the same PID  value 
   (this value is unique within a specific TS Multiplex). The term 
   "Stream" is defined in MPEG-2 [ISO-MPEG2]. This describes the 
   content carried by a specific TS Logical Channel (see, ULE Stream). 
   Some PID values are reserved (by MPEG-2) for specific signaling. 
   Other standards (e.g., ATSC, DVB) also reserve specific PID values. 
        
   TS Multiplex: In this document, this term defines a set of MPEG-2 TS  
   Logical Channels sent over a single lower layer connection. This may  
   be a common physical link (i.e. a transmission at a specified symbol  
   rate, FEC setting, and transmission frequency) or an encapsulation  
   provided by another protocol layer (e.g. Ethernet, or RTP over IP).  
   The same TS Logical Channel may be repeated over more than one TS  
   Multiplex (possibly associated with a different PID value) 
   [RFC4259], for example to redistribute the same multicast content to 
   two terrestrial TV transmission cells.   
        
   TS Packet: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over a TS Multiplex  
   [ISO-MPEG2]. Each TS Packet carries a 4B header.  
        
   UDL: Unidirectional link: A one-way transmission link. For example, 
   and IP over DVB link using a broadcast satellite link.  
    
   ULE: Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE). A 
   scheme that encapsulates PDUs, into SNDUs that are sent in a series 
   of TS Packets using a single TS Logical Channel [RFC4326].

   3. Address Resolution Requirements  
 
   The MPEG IP address resolution process is independent of the choice 
   of encapsulation and needs to support a set of IP over MPEG-2 
   encapsulation formats, including MPE [ETSI-DAT, ETSI-DAT1, ATSC-
   DAT]) and the IETF-defined Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation 
   (ULE) [RFC4326].  
    
   The general IP over MPEG-2 AR requirements are summarized below: 
 
        A protocol version, to indicate the specific AR protocol in use 
        and which may include the supported encapsulation method. 
           
        A method (e.g. well-known L2/L3 address/addresses) to identify 
        the AR server sourcing the AR information. 
           
        A method to represent IPv4/IPv6 AR information (including 
        security associations to authenticate the AR information that 
        will present address masquerading).  
         
        A method to install AR information associated with clients at 
        the AR server (registration).  
         
        Scalable and efficient method for transmission of AR 
        information from an AR server to clients (link local multicast, 
        is preferable to subnet broadcast). 
         
        Incremental update of the AR information held by clients. 
         
        Procedures for purging clients of stale AR information. 
      
    
   An MPEG-2 transmission network may support multiple IP networks. 
   If this is the case, it is important to recognise the context 
   (scope) within which an address is resolved, to prevent packets from 
   one addressed scope leaking into other scopes [RFC4259]. Examples of 
   overlapping IP address assignments include:    
    
      (i) Private unicast addresses (e.g. in IPv4, 10/8 prefix;   
          172.16/12 prefix; 192.168/16 prefix). Packets with these  
          addresses should be confined to one addressed area. IPv6  
          also defines link-local addresses that must not be forwarded  
          beyond the link on which they were first sent.  
    
      (ii) Local scope multicast addresses.  These are only valid  
           within the local area (examples for IPv4 include:  
           224.0.0/24; 224.0.1/24). Similar cases exist for some IPv6  
           multicast addresses [RFC2375]. 
    
      (iii) Scoped multicast addresses [RFC2365] [RFC 2375].   
            Forwarding of these addresses is controlled by the scope  
            associated with the address.  The addresses are only valid  
            within an addressed area (e.g. the 239/8 [RFC2365]).

   Overlapping address assignments may also occur at L2, where the same 
   NPA/MAC address is used to identify multiple Receivers [RFC4259]: 
    
      (i)  An NPA unicast address must be unique within the addressed   
           area. The IEEE assigned MAC addresses used in Ethernet LANs  
           are globally unique. If the NPA addresses are not globally  
           unique, an NPA address must only be re-used by Receivers in   
    
           different addressed (scoped) areas.          
    
      (ii) The NPA broadcast address (all 1 MAC address). Traffic  
           with this address should be confined to one addressed area.  
    
      (iii) IP and other protocols may view sets of MAC multicast  
           addresses as link-local, and may produce unexpected results  
           if frames with these address are distributed across several  
           private networks. 
    
   Reception of unicast packets destined for another addressed area 
   will lead to an increase in the rate of received packets by systems  
   connected via the network. Reception of the additional network 
   traffic may contribute to processing load, but should not lead to 
   unexpected protocol behaviour, providing that systems can be 
   uniquely addressed. It does however introduce a potential Denial of 
   Service (DoS) opportunity.  When the Receiver operates as an IP 
   router, the receipt of such a packet can lead to unexpected protocol 
   behaviour.  
    
    
3.1 Unicast Support 
    
   Unicast address resolution is required at two levels. At the upper 
   level, the AR procedure needs to associate an IP address with a 
   specific NPA/MAC address. At the lower level, the IP (or MAC) 
   address needs to be associated with a specific TS Logical Channel 
   (PID value) and the corresponding TS Multiplex. 
    
   Within a specific scope, the same unicast IP address may be 
   associated with more than one TS Logical Channel [ETSI-DAT]. These 
   may have different content (e.g. when several different IP 
   Encapsulators contribute IP flows destined to the same Receiver), 
   but there is also the possibility of receiving duplicated copies of 
   IP packets. 
 
    
3.2 Multicast Support  
    
   Multicast is an important application for MPEG-2 Transmission 
   Networks, since it exploits the advantages of native support for 
   link broadcast. Multicast address resolution occurs at the network 
   level in associating a specific L2 address with an IP Group 
   Destination Address (section 5).  In IPv4 and IPv6 over Ethernet,

   this association is normally a direct mapping, and this is the 
   default method also specified in both ULE [RFC4326] and in MPE 
   [ETSI-DAT]. 
    
   Address resolution must also occur at the MPEG-2 level (section 4). 
   The goal of this multicast address resolution is the association of 
   an IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address with a specific TS Logical Channel 
   (PID value) and the corresponding TS Multiplex.  This association 
   needs to permit a large number of active multicast groups, and 
   should minimise the processing load at the Receiver when filtering 
   and forwarding IP multicast packets (e.g. by distributing the 
   multicast traffic over a number of TS Logical Channels). Schemes 
   that allow hardware filtering can be beneficial, since these may 
   relieve the drivers and operating systems from discarding unwanted 
   multicast traffic.   
    
   There are specific issues concerning IP multicast over MPEG-2 
   Transmission Networks:   
    
   (i)  Mapping IP multicast groups to the underlying MPEG-2 TS Logical 
        Channel (PID) and the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex at the Encapsulator. 
    
   (ii) Provide signaling information to allow a Receiver to  
        locate an IP multicast flow within an MPEG-2 TS Multiplex.  
    
        
   Methods are required to identify the scope of an address when an 
   MPEG-2 network supports several logical IP networks and carries 
   groups within different multicast scopes. 
    
   Appropriate procedures need to specify the correct action when the 
   same multicast group is available on separate TS Logical Channels. 
   This could arise when different Encapsulators contribute IP packets 
   with the same IP Group Destination Address in the ASM address range. 
   Another case arises when a Receiver could receive more than one copy 
   of the same packet (e.g. when packets are replicated across 
   different TS Logical Channels, or even different TS Multiplexes, a 
   method known as Simulcasting [DVB-DAT]). At the IP level, the 
   host/router may be unaware of this duplication and this needs to be 
   detected by other means. 
    
   In some scenarios, a pre-defined set of IP multicast group 
   destination addresses may be in used within a MPEG-2 transmission 
   network. Prior knowledge of the active set of addresses allows 
   appropriate AR records to be constructed for each address, and to 
   pre-assign the corresponding PID value (e.g., selected to optimise 
   Receiver processing; to group related addresses to the same PID 
   value; and/or to reflect a policy for usage of specific ranges of 
   PID values). 
    
   When the MPEG-2 Network is peered to the multicast-enabled Internet, 
   an arbitrarily large number of IP multicast group destination 
   addresses may be in use and the set forwarded on the transmission

   network may be expected to vary significantly with time.  Note that 
   some uses of IP multicast employ a range of addresses to support a 
   single application (e.g., ND [RFC2461], LCT [RFC3451], WEBRC 
   [RFC3738]).  The current set of active addresses may be determined 
   dynamically via a multicast group membership protocol (e.g., IGMP 
   [RFC3376], MLD [RFC3810]), via multicast routing (e.g., PIM 
   [RFC2362]) and/or other means (e.g. [RFC3819]), however each active 
   address requires a binding by the AR method. There are therefore 
   advantages in using a method that does not need to explicitly 
   advertise AR binding for each IP traffic flow, but is able to 
   distribute traffic across a number of L2 TS Logical Channels (e.g., 
   using a hash/mapping that resembles the mapping from IP addresses to 
   MAC addresses [RFC1112, RFC2464]). Such methods can reduce the 
   volume of AR information that needs to be distributed, and reduce 
   the AR processing.

4. MPEG-2 Address Resolution  
    
   The first part of this section describes the role of MPEG-2 
   signaling to identify streams (TS Logical Channels [RFC4259]) within 
   the L2 infrastructure. 
    
   The MPEG-2 TS in ISO 13818-1 [ISO-MPEG2] identifies the existence 
   and format of a stream, using a combination of two PSI tables: the 
   Programme Association Table (PAT) and entries in the program element 
   loop of a Programme Map Table (PMT). PMT Tables are sent 
   infrequently, and are typically small in size. The PAT is sent using 
   the well-known PID value of 0X000. This table provides the 
   correspondence between a program_number and a PID value. (The 
   program_number is the numeric label associated with a program.) Each 
   program in the Table is associated with a specific PID value, used 
   to identify a TS.  The identified TS is used to send the PMT, which 
   associates a set of PID values with the individual components of the 
   programme. This approach de-references the PID values when the MPEG-
   2 Network includes multiplexors or re-multiplexors that renumber the 
   PID values of the TS Logical Channels that they process.  
     
   In addition to signaling the Receiver with the PID value assigned to 
   a stream, PMT entries indicate the presence of Streams using ULE and 
   MPE to the variety devices that may operate in the MPEG-2 
   transmission network (multiplexors, remultiplexors, rate shapers, 
   advertisement insertion equipment, etc).  
    
   A multiplexor or remultiplexor may also change the PID values 
   associated with a Stream during the multiplexing process, the new 
   value being reflected in an updated PMT. TS Packets that carry a PID 
   value that is not associated with a PMT entry (an orphan PID), may, 
   and usually will, be dropped by ISO 13818-1 compliant L2 equipment, 
   resulting in the TS Logical Channel not being forwarded across the 
   transmission network. In networks that do not employ any 
   intermediate devices (e.g. scenarios C,E,F of [RFC4259]), or where 
   devices have other means to determine the set of PID values in use, 
   the PMT table may still be sent (but is not required for this 
   purpose). 
    
   Although the basic PMT information may be used to identify the 
   existence of IP traffic, it does not associate a Stream with an IP 
   prefix/address. The remainder of the section describes IP addresses 
   resolution mechanisms relating to MPEG-2.   
 
    
4.1 Static configuration.  
    
   The static mapping option, where IP addresses or flows are 
   statically mapped to specific PIDs is the equivalent to signaling 
   "out-of-band". The application programmer, installing engineer, or 
   user receives the mapping via some outside means, not in the MPEG-2 
   TS. This is useful for testing, experimental networks, small 
   subnetworks and closed domains.

   A single "well-known" PID is a specialisation of this. This scheme 
   is used by current DOCSIS cable modems [DOCSIS], where all IP 
   traffic is placed into the specified TS stream. Section, or MAC, 
   filtering may be used to differentiate subnetworks.  
 
    
4.1.1 MPEG-2 Cable Networks 
    
   Cable networks use a different transmission schemes for downstream, 
   (head-end to cable modem) and upstream (cable modem to head-end) 
   transmission.  
    
   The information is sent (on the downstream) to the cable modems as 
   IP/Ethernet packets encapsulated in MPEG-2 TS Packets sent on a 
   single well-known TS Logical Channel (PID). There is no use of in-
   band signaling tables. On the upstream, the common approach is to 
   use Ethernet framing, rather than IP/Ethernet over MPEG-2, although 
   other proprietary schemes also continue to be used. 
    
   Until the deployment of DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS, most address 
   resolution schemes for IP traffic in cable networks were 
   proprietary, and did not usually employ a table-based address 
   resolution method. Proprietary methods continue to be used in some 
   cases where cable modems require interaction. In this case, 
   equipment at the head-end may act as gateways between the cable 
   modem and the Internet. These gateways receive L2 information and 
   allocate an IP address.  
    
   DOCSIS uses DHCP for IP client configuration. The Cable Modem 
   Terminal System (CMTS) provides a DHCP server that allocates IP 
   addresses to DOCSIS cable modems. The MPEG-2 Transmission Network 
   provides a L2 bridged network to the cable modem. This usually acts 
   as a DHCP Relay for IP devices [RFC2131, RFC3256]. Issues in 
   deployment of IPv6 are described in [ID-V6OPS-DEPLOY].  
 
4.2 MPEG-2 Table-Based Address Resolution  
    
   The information about the ser if MPEG-2 Transport Streams carried 
   over a TS Multiplex can be distributed can be distributed via SI/PSI 
   Tables, which are usually sent periodically (section 4). This design 
   requires access to and processing of the SI Table information by 
   each Receiver [ETSI-SI, ETSI-SI1].  This scheme reflects the 
   complexity of delivering and co-ordinating the various Transport 
   Streams associated with multimedia TV. A TS Multiplex may provide AR 
   information for IP services by integrating additional information 
   into the existing control tables or by transmitting additional SI 
   Tables that are specific to the IP service.  
    
   Examples of MPEG-2 Table usage to allow an MPEG-2 Receiver to 
   identify the appropriate PID and multiplex associated with a 
   specific IP address include:

   (i)  IP/MAC Notification Table (INT) in the DVB Data standard  
        [ETSI-DAT]. This provides uni-directional address resolution of  
        IPv4/IPv6 multicast addresses to an MPEG-2 TS.             
    
   (ii) Application Information Table (AIT) in the Multimedia Home 
   Platform  
        (MHP) specifications [ETSI-MHP].  
                  
   (iii) Multicast Mapping Table (MMT) an MPEG-2 Table employed by some 
        DVB-RCS systems to provide uni-directional address resolution 
        of IPv4 multicast addresses to an MPEG-2 TS.  
    
   The MMT and AIT are used for specific applications. The INT [DVB-
   DAT] is a more general DVB method, that supports MAC, IPv4, and IPv6 
   AR when used in combination with the other MPEG-2 tables (see 
   section 4).  
    
    
4.2.1 IP/MAC Notification Table (INT) and its usage 
    
   The INT provides a method for carrying information about the 
   location of IP/L2 flows within a DVB network. A Platform_ID, 
   identifies the addressing scope for a set of IP/L2 streams and/or 
   Receivers. A Platform may span several Transport Streams within one 
   or multiple TS Multiplexes and represents a single IP network with a 
   harmonized address space (scope). This allows for the coexistence of 
   several independent IP/MAC address scopes within an MPEG-2 Network.  
      
   The INT allows both fully-specified IP addresses and prefix 
   matching, to reduce the size of table (and hence enhance signaling 
   efficiency). An IPv4/IPv6 "subnet mask" may be specified in full 
   form or using a slash notation (e.g. /127). IP multicast addresses 
   can be specified with or without a source (address or range), 
   although if a source address is specified, then only the slash 
   notation may be used for prefixes.  
      
   In addition to identification and security descriptors, the 
   following descriptors are defined for address binding in INT tables:  
    
   (i)  target_MAC_address_descriptor: The descriptor used to  
        describe a single or set of MAC addresses (and their mask). 
                
   (ii)   target_MAC_address_range_descriptor: May be used to set 
          filters. 
    
  (iii)  target_IP_address_descriptor: The descriptor describing a  
         single or set of IPv4 unicast or multicast addresses (and       
         their mask).  
 
   (iv) target_IP_slash_descriptor:  Allows definition and announcement  
       of an IPv4 prefix.  
    
   (v)  target_IP_source_slash_descriptor: Uses source and destination

INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks               Feb 2006  
 
 
       addresses to target a single or set of systems.  
    
   (vi) IP/MAC  stream_location_descriptor: This descriptor locates an  
       IP/MAC stream in a DVB network.  
    
   The following descriptors provide corresponding functions for IPv6 
   addresses: 
          
        target_IPv6_address_descriptor  
        target_IPv6_slash_descriptor  
        and target_IPv6_source_slash_descriptor  
         
   The ISP_access_mode_descriptor allows specification of a second 
   address descriptor to access an ISP via an alternative non-DVB 
   (possibly non-IP) network.  
    
   The INT provides a set of descriptors to specify addressing in a DVB 
   network. One key benefit is that the approach follows the MPEG-2 
   signaling methods (section 4) and is integrated with the other 
   signaling information. This allows the INT to operate in the 
   presence of (re)multiplexors [RFC4259] and to refer to PID values 
   that are carried within a number of different TS Multiplexes. This 
   makes it well-suited to a Broadcast TV Scenario [RFC4259]. 
    
   The principle drawback is a need for a Encapsulator to introduce 
   associated PSI/SI MPEG-2 control information. This control 
   information needs to be processed at a Receiver. This requires 
   access to information below the IP layer. The position of this 
   processing within the protocol stack makes it hard to associate the 
   results with IP Policy, management and security functions. The use 
   of centralized management prevents the implementation of a more 
   dynamic scheme. This method is currently specified for Multi-
   Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) [ETSI-DAT]. 
    
    
4.2.2 Multicast Mapping Table (MMT) and its usage 
    
   The Multicast Mapping Table (MMT) is carried in an MPEG-2 control 
   table that associates a set of multicast addresses with the 
   corresponding PID values.  This table allows a DVB-RCS Forward Link 
   Subsystem (FLSS) to specify the mapping of IPv4 addresses to PID 
   values within a specific TS Multiplex. Receivers (DVB-RCS Return 
   Channel Satellite Terminals, RCSTs) may use this table to determine 
   the PID values associated with an IP multicast flow that it requires 
   to receive. The MMT is not currently a part of the DVB-RCS 
   specification. 
    
      
4.2.3 Application Information Table (AIT) and its usage 
     
   The DVB Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) specification [ETSI-MHP] does 
   not define a specific AR function. However, an Application 
   Information Table (AIT) is defined that allows MHP Receivers to

   receive a variety of control information. The AIT uses a DSMCC 
   format table providing information about data broadcasts, the 
   required activation state of applications carried by a broadcast 
   stream, etc. This information allows a broadcaster to request that a 
   Receiver change the activation state of an application, and to 
   direct applications to receive specific multicast packet flows 
   (using IPv4 or IPv6 descriptors).  In MHP, AR is not seen as a 
   specific function, but as a part of a wider configuration and 
   control function.  
    
4.2.4 Address Resolution in ATSC 
     
   ATSC defines a system that allows transmission of IP packets within 
   an MPEG-2 network. An MPEG-2 Program (defined by the PMT) may 
   contain one or more applications [ATSC-A90] that include IP 
   Multicast streams [ATSC-A92]. IP Multicast data are signaled in the 
   PMT using a stream_type indicator equal to 0x0D. A MAC address list 
   descriptor [SCTE-1] may also be included in the PMT. 
    
   The approach focuses on applications that serve the transmission 
   network. A method is defined that binds the IP Multicast media 
   streams and the corresponding SDP announcement streams to particular 
   MPEG-2 Program Elements by using the MPEG-2 SI tables.  Each 
   application constitutes an independent network. The MPEG-2 Network 
   boundaries establish an IP addressing scope.  
    
    
4.2.5 Comparison of SI/PSI table approaches  
     
   The MPEG-2 methods based on SI/PSI meet the specified requirements 
   of the groups that created them and all have their strength:  the 
   INT in terms of flexibility and extensibility, the MMT in its 
   simplicity, the AIT in its extensibility. However, they exhibit 
   scalability constraints, represent technology specific solutions and 
   do not fully adopt IP-centric approaches that would enable easier 
   use of the MPEG-2 bearer as a link technology within the wider 
   Internet. 
    
    
4.3 IP-based resolution of TS Logical Channels 
    
   As MPEG-2 Networks evolve to become multi-service networks, the use 
   of IP protocols is becoming more prevalent. Most MPEG-2 Networks now 
   use some IP protocols for operations, control and data delivery, 
   address resolution information could also be sent using IP 
   transport. There is an opportunity to define an IP-level method that 
   could use an IP multicast protocol over a well-known IP multicast 
   address. The advantages of using an IP-based address resolution for 
   Transport Streams include: 
    
   (i) Simplicity: 


  
Expires June 2006                                            [page 17] 
INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks               Feb 2006  
 
 
   The AR mechanism does not require interpretation of Layer 2 tables; 
   this is an advantage especially in the growing market share for home 
   network and audio video networked entities. 
    
   (ii) Uniformity: 
   An IP-based protocol can provide a common method across different 
   network scenarios for IP/MAC address mappings to TS Logical Channels 
   (PID values). 
      
   (iii) Extensibility: 
   IP-based AR mechanisms allow an independent evolution of the AR 
   protocol. This includes dynamic methods to request address 
   resolution and the ability to include other L2 information (e.g. 
   Encryption keys). 
    
   (iv) Integration 
   The information exchanged by IP-based AR protocols can easily be 
   integrated as a a part of the IP network layer, simplifying support 
   for AAA, policy, OAM, mobility, configuration control, etc. that 
   combine AR with security. 
    
    
   The drawbacks of an IP-based method include: 
    
   (i) It can not operate over an MPEG-2 Network that uses MPEG-2 
   remultiplexors [RFC4259] that modify the PID values of the TS 
   Logical Channels during the multiplexing operation. This makes the 
   method unsuitable for use in deployed broadcast TV networks 
   [RFC4259]. 
    
   (ii) IP-based methods can introduce concerns about the integrity of 
   the information and authentication of the sender [RFC4259]. (These 
   concerns are also applicable to MPEG-2 Table methods, but in this 
   case the information is confined to the L2 network, or parts of the 
   network where gateway devices isolate the MPEG-2 devices from the 
   larger Internet creating virtual MPEG-2 private networks.) IP-based 
   solutions should therefore implement security mechanisms that may be 
   used to authenticate the sender and verify the integrity of the AR 
   information, as a part of a larger security framework. 
    
    
4.3.1 IP-based multicast resolution of TS Logical Channels 
    
   Address resolution must also be performed to associate the IP 
   multicast Group Destination Address with an MPEG-2 layer TS Logical 
   Channel (PID) and TS Multiplex. Solutions have been described in 4.2 
   that perform this below the IP layer using MPEG-2 Tables.  Such 
   methods currently perform a direct mapping (where a single address 
   or set of addresses are associated with a specific PID value).  
    
   An IP-level method may use an IP multicast protocol running over a 
   well-known (or discovered) IP multicast address. Scalability is an 
   important feature of any multicast AR protocol. Methods that employ

   prefix matching (e.g. where a range of source/destination addresses 
   are matched to a single entry are desirable), as also are methods

5. Mapping IP addresses to NPA/MAC addresses  
    
   This section reviews IETF protocols that may be used to assign and 
   manage the mapping of IP addresses to/from NPA/MAC addresses over 
   MPEG-2 Networks. 
    
   An IP Encapsulator requires AR information to select an appropriate 
   MAC/NPA address in the SNDU header [RFC 4259] (see also section 6). 
   The information to complete this header may be taken directly from a 
   neighbour/arp cache, or may require the Encapsulator to retrieve the 
   information using an AR protocol. The way in which this information 
   is collected will depend upon whether the Encapsulator functions as 
   a Router (at L3) or a Bridge (at L2).  
    
   Two IETF-defined protocols for mapping IP addresses to NPA/MAC 
   addresses are the Address Resolution Protocol, ARP [RFC-ARP], and 
   the Neighbor Discovery Protocol, ND [RFC2461], for IPv4 and IPv6 
   respectively. Both protocols are normally used in a bi-directional 
   mode, although both also permit unsolicited transmission of 
   mappings. The mapping defined in [RFC4624] can result in a large 
   number of active MAC multicast addresses (at least one per end 
   host). 
    
   ARP requires support for L2 broadcast packets. A large number of 
   Receivers can lead to a proportional increase in ARP traffic, a 
   concern for bandwidth-limited networks. Transmission delay can also 
   impact protocol performance. 
    
   ARP also has a number of security vulnerabilities. ARP spoofing is 
   where 
   a system can be fooled by a rogue device that sends a fictitious ARP 
   response that includes the IP address of a legitimate network 
   system, and the MAC of a rogue system. This causes legitimate 
   systems on the network to update their ARP tables with the false 
   mapping and then send future packets to the rogue system instead of 
   the legitimate system. Using this method, a rogue system can see 
   (and modify) packets sent through the network. 
 
   Secure ARP (SARP) uses a secure tunnel between each client and a 
   server at a wireless access point or router [RFC2246]. The router 
   ignores any ARP responses not associated with clients using the 
   secure tunnels. Therefore, only legitimate ARP Responses are used 
   for updating ARP tables. SARP requires the installation of software 
   at each client. It suffers from the same scalability issues as the 
   standard ARP. 
    
   The ND protocol uses a set of IP multicast addresses. In large 
   networks, many multicast addresses are used, but clients typically 
   only listen to a restricted set of group destination addresses and 
   little traffic is usually sent in each group. An AR multicast 
   mechanism for MPEG-2 Networks therefore needs to be able to support 
   this in a scalable manner.

   A large number of ND Router Solicitation messages may cause a large 
   demand for performing asymmetric operations. The base ND protocol 
   limits the rate at which multicast responses to solicitations can be 
   sent. 
    
   The Secure Neighbor Discovery or SEND [RFC3917] was developed to 
   address known security vulnerabilities in ND. It can also reduce the 
   AR traffic compared to ND. SEND also does not impact the IPSec 
   architecture and implementations, and provides improved support for 
   security decisions based on application state. This allows co-
   existence of SEND and insecure ND on the same link.  
    
   DHCP [RFC2131] may be used over MPEG-2 transmission networks. DHCP 
   consists of two components: a protocol for delivering system-
   specific configuration parameters from a DHCP server to a DHCP 
   client (e.g. default router, DNS server) and a mechanism for 
   allocation of network addresses to systems. DHCP messages  (e.g. 
   DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST, DHCPOFFER) may include options [RFC2132]. 
 
 
5.1 Uni-directional links supporting uni-directional connectivity 
    
   MPEG-2 Networks may provide a Uni-Directional broadcast Link (UDL), 
   with no return path. Such links may be used for unicast applications 
   that do not require a return path (e.g. based on UDP), but are more 
   commonly used for IP multicast content distribution.

   Although ARP and ND may both operate in an unsolicited/promiscuous 
   mode where they advertise local address binding information to the 
   remote nodes, this does not provide an appropriate method to resolve 
   the remote (destination) address in a uni-directional environment. 
   To perform this task, these protocols require bi-directional L2/L3 
   connectivity.  
    
   Unidirectional links therefore require a separate out-of-band 
   configuration method to establish the appropriate AR information at

   the sender and clients. ULE [RFC4326] defines a mode in which the 
   NPA/MAC address is omitted from the SNDU. In some scenarios, this 
   may relieve an Encapsulator of the need for L2 AR. 
    
    
5.2 Uni-directional links with bi-directional connectivity 
    
   Bi-directional connectivity may be realised using a uni-directional 
   link in combination with another network path. Common combinations 
   are a Feed link using MPEG-2 satellite transmission and a return 
   link using terrestrial network infrastructure. This topology is 
   often known as a Hybrid network, and has asymmetric network routing.

                Figure 2: Bi-directional connectivity 
    
   The Uni-Directional Link Routing, UDLR [RFC3077] protocol may be 
   used to overcome issues associated with asymmetric routing. It hides 
   the uni-directional routing is hidden from the IP and upper layer 
   protocols, by providing a L2 tunneling mechanism that emulates a bi-
   directional broadcast link at L2. A network using UDLR has a 
   topology where a Feed Router and all Receivers form a logical Local 
   Area Network. Encapsulating L2 frames allows them to be sent through 
   an Internet Path.  
    
   Since many uni-directional links employ wireless technology for the  
   forward (Feed) link (e.g., [ETSI-DAT]), there may be an appreciable  
   cost associated with forwarding traffic on the Feed link. Therefore, 
   it is often desirable to prevent forwarding unnecessary traffic, 
   (e.g. for multicast this implies control of which groups are 
   forwarded). The implications of forwarding in the return direction 
   must also be considered (e.g., asymmetric capacity and loss 
   [RFC3449]). This suggests a need to minimise the volume and 
   frequency of control messages.  
 
   Three different AR cases may be identified: 
    
   (i) A Feed Router needs a Receiver NPA/MAC address. 
    
   This occurs when a Feed Router sends an IP packet using the Feed UDL 
   to a Receiver whose NPA/MAC address is unknown. In IPv4, the Feed

INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks               Feb 2006  
 
 
   Router sends an ARP REQUEST with the IP address of the Receiver. The 
   Receiver that recognises its IP address replies with an ARP RESPONSE 
   to the NPA/MAC address of the Feed Router (e.g. using a UDLR 
   tunnel). The Feed Router may then address IP packets to the unicast 
   NPA/MAC address associated with the Receiver. (The ULE packet format 
   also permits packets to be sent without specifying a NPA/MAC 
   address, where this is desirable (section 6.1, 6.5).) 
    
   (ii) A Receiver needs the Feed Router NPA/MAC address. 
    
   This occurs when a Receiver sends an IP packet to a Feed Router 
   whose NPA/MAC address is unknown. In IPv4, the Receiver sends an ARP 
   REQUEST with the IP address of the Feed Router (e.g. using a UDLR 
   tunnel). The Feed Router replies with an ARP RESPONSE using the Feed 
   UDL. The Receiver may then address IP packets to the NPA/MAC address 
   of the recipient. 
    
   (iii) A Receiver needs another Receiver NPA/MAC address. 
   This occurs when a Receiver sends an IP packet to another Receiver 
   whose NPA/MAC address is unknown. In IPv4, the Receiver sends an ARP 
   REQUEST with the IP address of the remote Receiver (e.g. using a 
   UDLR tunnel to the Feed Router). The request is forwarded over the 
   Feed UDL.  The target Receiver replies with an ARP RESPONSE (e.g. 
   using a UDLR tunnel). The Feed Router forwards the response on the 
   UDL. The Receiver may then address IP packets to the NPA/MAC address 
   of the recipient. 
    
    
   These 3 cases allow any system connected to the UDL to obtain the 
   NPA/MAC address of any other system. Similar exchanges may be 
   performed using the ND protocol for IPv6. 
 
   A long round trip delay (via the UDL and UDLR tunnel) impacts the 
   performance of reactive address resolution procedures. In contrast 
   to Ethernet, during the interval when resolution is taking place, 
   many IP packets may be received that are addressed to the AR Target 
   address. The arp specification allows the interface to discard these 
   packets while awaiting the response to the resolution request. An 
   appropriately sized buffer would however prevent this loss. The time 
   to complete address resolution may also be reduced by use of an AR 
   Server at the Feed, which may learn MAC addresses from ARP RESPONSES 
   and would (proxy) publish them in response to Receiver ARP REQUESTS. 
 
   Using DHCP with UDLR requires prior establishment of the L2 
   connectivity to a DHCP server. Therefore, when UDLR networks use 
   DHCP, it can be beneficial to tune the DTCP HELLO message 
   periodicity.  
    
   The configuration of DHCP Servers and Clients should take into 
   account the link round trip delay. A larger delay may make it 
   desirable to tune the DHCP lease duration and the size of address 
   pool. Appropriate timer values should also be selected: the DHCP 
   messages retransmission timeout, and the maximum delay that a DHCP

   Server waits before deciding that the absence of an ICMP echo 
   response means that the relevant address is free. 
    
   DHCP Clients may retransmit DHCP messages if they do not receive a 
   response. Some client implementations specify a timeout for the 
   DHCPDISCOVER message that is small (e.g. suited to Ethernet delay) 
   providing insufficient time for a DHCP Server to respond to a 
   DHCPDISCOVER retransmission before expiry of the check on the lease 
   availability (by an ICMP echo request), resulting in potential 
   address conflict. 
    
    
5.3 Bi-directional Links 
     
   Bi-directional IP networks can be and are constructed by a 
   combination of two MPEG-2 transmission links. The combined link 
   functions as a full duplex interface. Examples of this use include 
   two-way DVB-S satellite links and the DVB-RCS system. 
    
    
5.4 IP Multicast AR 
    
   This section describes the case where the destination network layer 
   address is an IP multicast Group Destination Address.  
    
   In MPE [DVB-DAT], the mapping of IP multicast addresses to MAC/NPA 
   addresses follows normal practice for IEEE MAC Addresses when using 
   IPv4 and IPv6. (A variant of DVB (DVB-H) uses a modified MAC header 
   [DVB_DAT]). 
    
   In ULE [ID-RFC 4326], the L2 NPA address is optional, and is not 
   necessarily required when the Receiver is able to perform efficient 
   L3 multicast address filtering. When present, it follows the mapping 
   of MPE and many other L2 link technologies.

6. Link Layer Support 
    
   This section considers link-layer (L2) support for address 
   resolution. It considers two issues: One is the code-point used at 
   L2 and the other is the efficiency of encapsulation for transmission 
   required to support the AR method. The table below summarises the 
   options for both MPE [ETSI-DAT] and ULE [RFC4326] encapsulations.

      Table of L2 support and overhead (x=supported, -=not supported) 
    
   The remainder of the section describes IETF-specified AR methods for 
   use with these encapsulation formats. 
    
    
6.1 ULE without a destination MAC/NPA address (D=1) 
    
   The ULE encapsulation supports a mode (D=1) where the NPA/MAC 
   address is not present in the encapsulated frame. This mode may be 
   used with both IPv4 and IPv6.  When used, the Receiver is expected 
   to perform network-layer filtering of packets based on their IP 
   destination address. Encapsulators must ensure that packets are 
   associated with a TS Logical Channel (PID value) that uniquely 
   identifies the intended recipient [RFC4326]. This requires careful 
   consideration of the network topology when a receiver acts is, or 
   delivers data to an IP router (a simple case where this is permitted 
   is the connection of stub networks that have no connectivity to 
   other networks). Since there is no MAC/NPA address in the SNDU, ARP 
   and NDP are not required.  
    
   IPv6 systems can automatically configure their IPv6 network address 
   based upon a local MAC address [RFC2462]. To use auto-configuration, 
   the IP driver at the Receiver may need to access the MAC/NPA address 
   of the receiving interface, even though this value is not being used 
   to filter received SNDUs.

6.2 ULE with a destination NPA/MAC address (D=0) 
    
   The IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC826] uses an IANA-
   assigned EtherType and may be used over ULE [RFC4326]. Although no 
   MAC source address is present in the ULE SNDU, the ARP protocol 
   still communicates the source MAC address in the ARP record payload 
   of any query messages that it generates. 
    
   The IPv6 ND protocol may be used. The protocol uses a block of IPv6 
   addresses, which need to be carried by the L2 network. The protocol 
   does not require specification of a MAC source address, although 
   this is required for a node to participate in Duplicate Address 
   Detection (DAD) [RFC2462]. 
    
    
6.3 MPE without LLC/SNAP Encapsulation 
    
   This is the default (and sometimes only) mode specified by most MPE 
   Encapsulators. MPE does not provide an IANA-assigned EtherType and 
   therefore can not support the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) 
   [RFC826]. 
    
   IPv6 is not supported in this encapsulation format, and therefore it 
   is not appropriate to consider the ND protocol. 
    
    
6.4 MPE with LLC/SNAP Encapsulation 
    
   The LLC/SNAP format of MPE provides an IANA-assigned EtherType and 
   therefore may support the ARP [RFC826]. There is no specification to 
   define how this is performed. No MAC source address is present in 
   the SNDU, although the protocol still communicates the source MAC 
   address in the ARP record payload of any query messages that it 
   generates. 
    
   The IPv6 ND protocol may be used with The LLC/SNAP format of MPE. 
   This requires specific multicast address to be carried by the L2 
   network. A MAC source address is required for a node to participate 
   in DAD. 
    
    
6.5 ULE with Bridging Header Extension (D=1) 
    
   The ULE encapsulation supports a bridging extension header that 
   supplies both a source and destination MAC address.  This can be 
   used without an NPA address (D=1). When no other Extension Headers 
   are present, the MAC destination address has the same position in 
   the ULE SNDU as that used for an NPA destination address.  The 
   Receiver may optionally be configured so that MAC destination 
   address value is identical to the Receiver NPA address. 
    
   At the Encapsulator, the ULE NPA/MAC destination address is 
   determined by a L2 forwarding decision.  Received frames may be

   forwarded or may be addressed to the Receiver itself. As in other L2 
   LANs, the Receiver may choose to filter received frames based on a 
   configured MAC destination address filter. ARP and ND messages may 
   be carried within a PDU that is bridged by this encapsulation 
   format.  
    
    
6.6 ULE with Bridging Header Extension and NPA Address (D=0) 
    
   The combination of a NPA address (D=0) and a bridging extension 
   header are allowed in ULE. This SNDU format supplies both a source 
   and destination MAC address and a NPA destination address (i.e. 
   Receiver NPA/MAC address).  
    
   At the Encapsulator, the value of the ULE NPA/MAC destination 
   address is determined by a L2 forwarding decision. At the Receiver, 
   frames may be forwarded or may be addressed to the Receiver itself. 
   As in other L2 LANs, the Receiver may choose to filter received 
   frames based on a configured MAC destination address filter. ARP and 
   ND messages may be carried within a PDU that is bridged by this 
   encapsulation format.  
    
    
6.7 MPE+LLC/SNAP+Bridging 
    
   The LLC/SNAP format MPE frames may optionally support an IEEE 
   bridging header [LLC]. This header supplies both a source and 
   destination MAC address, at the expense of larger encapsulation 
   overhead. The format defines two MAC destination addresses, one 
   associated with the MPE SNDU (i.e. Receiver MAC address) and one 
   with the bridged MAC frame (i.e. the MAC address of the intended 
   recipient in the remote LAN). At the Encapsulator, the MPE MAC 
   destination address is determined by a L2 forwarding decision. As in 
   other L2 LANs, the Receiver may choose to filter received frames 
   based on a configured MAC destination address filter. 
    
   At the Encapsulator, the MPE MAC destination address is determined 
   by a L2 forwarding decision. A Receiver may forward frames or they 
   may be addressed to the Receiver itself. As in other L2 LANs, the 
   Receiver may choose to filter received frames based on a configured 
   MAC destination address filter. ARP and ND messages may be carried 
   within a PDU that is bridged by this encapsulation format. The MPE 
   MAC destination address is determined by a L2 forwarding decision.

7. Conclusions  
    
   This document has described addressing and address resolution issues 
   for the using IP protocols over MPEG-2 transmission networks using 
   both wired and wireless technologies. A number of specific IETF 
   protocols are discussed along with their expected behaviour over 
   MPEG-2 transmission networks. Recommendations for their usage are 
   provided.  
    
   In MPEG-2 Networks, a static binding can be configured for IP 
   addresses and PIDs (as in some cable networks).  In broadcast 
   networks, this information is normally provided by the 
   Encapsulator/Multiplexor and carried in tables (e.g. AIT in MHP, the 
   IP Notification Table, INT, of DVB and the DVB-RCS Multicast Mapping 
   Table, MMT). This document has reviewed the status of these current 
   address resolution mechanisms in MPEG-2 transmission networks, 
   defined their usage and provided information to identify what would 
   be needed to improve their support for IP protocols. 
     
      
8. Security Considerations  
    
   L2 signaling in MPEG-2 transmission networks is provided by 
   (periodic) broadcasting information in the control plane using 
   PSI/SI tables. A loss or modification of the SI information may 
   result in an inability to identify the TS Logical Channel (PID) that 
   is used for a service. This will prevent reception of the intended 
   IP packet stream.  
    
   The normal security issues relating to the use of wireless links for 
   transmission of Internet traffic should be considered.  It is 
   recommended that future AR protocols support authentication of the 
   source of AR messages and the integrity of the AR information, this 
   avoids known security vulnerabilities resulting from insertion of 
   unauthorised AR messages within a L2 infrastructure. Readers are 
   also referred to the known security issues associated with ARP 
   [RFC826] and ND [RFC2461].

APPENDIX: Candidate IP-based L2 AR Protocols 
    
   This appendix contains a list of candidate protocols that could be 
   used to define "above IP" AR. None of these protocols currently 
   support the AR methods required for MPEG-2 Transmission Networks. 
   Specifically they do not all support: 
    
   (i) Resolution of Addresses to TS Logical Channels 
   (ii) Resolution of multiple addresses in a single AR update message 
   (table-based). 
   (iii) Multicast transport. 
    
   Candidate protocols include: 
    
   ARP <extension required> 
    - IPv4 only. 
    - No table support <could be added> 
    - Support for versioning within current implementations not clear. 
    - Broadcast mode has drawbacks. 
    - No obvious support for scoping to multiple addressing domains. 
    
   ND <extension required> 
    - IPv6 only. 
    - No table support <could be added> 
    - Use multicast address. 
    - No obvious support for scoping to multiple addressing domains. 
    
   DTCP [RFC3077]  <extension required> 
    - IPv4 and IPv6. 
    - Table support seems natural. 
    - Uses multicast address. 
    - Need to consider scoping for multiple addressing domains. 
    - Not really an IP AR protocol 
    - Already used on some (UDLR) links - and this new use seems 
   complementary. 
    
   AR/IP  <new protocol required> 
    - IPv4 and IPv6. 
    - Based on UDP or at network-layer. 
    - Could use multicast address. 
    - Could use some SIP-based signaling 
    - Table support possible. 
    - New protocol format. 
    - Could add scoping for multiple addressing domains. 
    
   XML/SIP/IP <new protocol required> 
    - IPv4 and IPv6. 
    - Based on UDP or at network-layer or an XML transport/SIP  
      for compatibility with DVB and 3GPP/3GPP2.  
    - Could use multicast address. 
    - Table support seems natural. 
    - New protocol format.

    - Could add scoping for multiple addressing domains. 
    - Extensible/flexible to other configuration data (if required).  
    - Compression of XML required to achieve efficiency comparable with 
   other methods.

   concepts 
     -02 fairly important review; took out all new protocol reference; 
   added one author; added contribution on real implementation 
     -02 Added content to respond to 61st IETF comments;  
   refined ID goals; rewrote section 4.2 and 4.3; added cable 
   information. 
     -03 Major reorganise to align with Charter, and clearly identify 
   IP issues. 
     -04 restructured the draft (major rewrite) and added discussion of 
   arp and ND related to specific cases for use.
