1.  Introduction

   The MRT record format [RFC6396] was developed to provide researchers
   and engineers a means to encapsulate, export, and archive routing
   protocol transactions and routing information base snapshots.

   The Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths]
   defines a BGP extension to allow the advertisement of multiple paths
   for the same address prefix without the new paths implicitly
   replacing any previous ones.

   This document contains an optional extension to the MRT format
   [RFC6396] and introduces additional definitions of MRT subtype fields
   to permit representation of multiple path advertisements
   [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Rationale

   MRT parsers are usually stateless.  In order to parse BGP messages
   which contain data structures that depend on the capabilities
   negotiated during the BGP session setup, the so-called MRT subtypes
   are utilized.  The Advertisement of Multiple Path
   [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths] extension for BGP alters the encoding of the
   BGP NLRI format for withdraws and announcements.  Therefore new
   BGP4MP/BGP4MP_ET subtypes as defined in [RFC6396] are required to
   signal to a MRT parser how to parse the NLRI.

   In section 4.3 [RFC6396] of the MRT specification RIB subtypes are
   specified.  Prefix length and prefix fields are encoded in the same
   manner as the BGP NLRI encoding.  In order to support path identifier
   information as defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths] new subtypes need
   to be added.

   The following two sections define the required subtypes.

4.  MRT Subtypes for Types BGP4MP/BGP4MP_ET

   This document defines the following new Subtypes:

   o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_ADDPATH

   o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_ADDPATH

   o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_LOCAL_ADDPATH

   o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_LOCAL_ADDPATH

   The fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent
   non-additional-path versions specified in section 4.4 [RFC6396].
   These enhancements continues to encapsulate the entire BGP message in
   the BGP message field.

5.  MRT Subtypes for Type TABLE_DUMP_V2

   This document defines the following new Subtypes:

   o  RIB_IPV4_UNICAST_ADDPATH

   o  RIB_IPV4_MULTICAST_ADDPATH

   o  RIB_IPV6_UNICAST_ADDPATH

   o  RIB_IPV6_MULTICAST_ADDPATH

Internet-Draft     Additional Paths Extensions in MRT          July 2016


   o  RIB_GENERIC_ADDPATH

   The fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent
   non-additional-path versions specified in section 4.3 [RFC6396].
   However, for the specific case of the 4 AFI/SAFI specific RIB
   subtypes, the existing RIB Entries field is re-defined as detailed in
   the sections below.

5.1.  AFI/SAFI specific RIB Subtypes

   In order to preserve the record compaction achieved by using the most
   common subtypes, and allowing multiple RIB Entries to be stored in a
   single TABLE_DUMP_V2 record, the existing RIB Entries field is
   redefined for use within the new AFI/SAFI specific RIB Subtypes
   defined by this document as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |         Peer Index            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                         Originated Time                       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                         Path Identifier                       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |      Attribute Length         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                    BGP Attributes... (variable)
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Figure 1: RIB Entries for AFI/SAFI-specific RIB Subtypes with
                         additional-paths support

   This adds a field to the RIB Entries record, to store the path
   identifier, when used with the RIB_IPV4_UNICAST_ADDPATH,
   RIB_IPV4_MULTICAST_ADDPATH, RIB_IPV6_UNICAST_ADDPATH and
   RIB_IPV6_MULTICAST_ADDPATH subtypes.

5.2.  RIB_GENERIC_ADDPATH Subtype

   The fields of this subtype are identical to the equivalent non-
   additional-path versions specified in section 4.3.3 [RFC6396].  These
   fields continue to encapsulate the raw and additional-path enabled
   AFI/SAFI/NLRI in the record, and the raw attributes in the RIB
   Entries.

   For clarity, the RIB Entries in this subtype are not redefined.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign the following subtype codes
   to the MRT name space [1]:

6.1.  BGP4MP/BGP4MP_ET Subtype codes:

      BGP4MP_MESSAGE_ADDPATH = 8 (Section 4)

      BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_ADDPATH = 9 (Section 4)

      BGP4MP_MESSAGE_LOCAL_ADDPATH = 10 (Section 4)

      BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_LOCAL_ADDPATH = 11 (Section 4)

   The values provided above are suggested as they are used in
   implementations.

6.2.  TABLE_DUMP_V2 Subtype codes:

      RIB_IPV4_UNICAST_ADDPATH = 8 (Section 5.1)

      RIB_IPV4_MULTICAST_ADDPATH = 9 (Section 5.1)

      RIB_IPV6_UNICAST_ADDPATH = 10 (Section 5.1)

      RIB_IPV6_MULTICAST_ADDPATH = 11 (Section 5.1)

      RIB_GENERIC_ADDPATH = 12 (Section 5.2)

   The values provided above are suggested as they are used in
   implementations.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

   However, the security considerations of [RFC6396] are equally
   applicable to this document, and this document permits the export of
   more detailed routing data.

   An organization that uses the MRT format to store their BGP routing
   information should be aware that supporting these extensions permits
   more detailed network path information to be stored, and should
   consider the implications of this within their environment.

   An organization that peers with public BGP collectors, and enables
   the additional-paths capability on a peering session, should be aware
   that it is exporting not only its best paths, but potentially other
   paths within its networks.  The BGP peer should consider any and all
   implications of exposing this additional data.
