1. Introduction 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used 
   to manage Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entities, which include 
   User Agents, Proxy servers, Redirect servers and Registrars. 
    
   Conventions used in this document 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 
   [RFC2119].  
    
2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD

   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
   2580 [RFC2580]. 
    
    
3. Overview 
    
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] is an application-
   layer control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying, and 
   terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions 
   include Internet telephone calls, multimedia distribution, and 
   multimedia conferences. This MIB provides some managed objects for 
   SIP entities defined in RFC 3261 - User Agent, Proxy Server, 
   Redirect Server and Registrar. It is provided as a base for the work 
   within the working group to define a MIB. 
    
   This MIB is intended to provide management of the basic SIP 
   entities. It provides for monitoring of status and protocol 
   statistics, as well as for configuration of SIP entities.  
    
4. Structure of SIP MIB 
 
   This memo specifies four MIB modules.  They are SIP-COMMON-MIB, SIP-
   SERVER-MIB, SIP-UA-MIB and SIP-TC.  SIP-COMMON-MIB contains common 
   objects used in all the SIP entities. SIP-SERVER-MIB contains 
   objects specific to Registrars, Proxies and Redirect Servers, and 
   SIP-UA-MIB includes objects specific to User Agents.  SIP-TC defines 
   the textual conventions used throughout MIB modules.  
    
   The MIB Modules contain following groups of objects: 
 
   -- SIP-COMMON-MIB: Common to all the SIP entities 
    
      sipCommonMIBObjects 
        | 
        + sipCommonCfgBase 
        | This object group defines configuration objects common to  
        | all SIP entities including SIP protocol version, operational 
        | and administrative status, SIP organization name, max number 
        | of SIP sessions an entity can manage, etc. 
        | 
        + sipCommonCfgTimer 
        | This object group defines timer configuration objects  
        | applicable to SIP user agent and SIP stateful proxy entities. 
        | 
        + sipCommonCfgRetry 
        | This object group defines retry counter configuration objects  
        | applicable to SIP user agent and SIP stateful proxy entities. 
        | 
        + sipCommonCfgExpires 
        | This object group defines Expires header value configuration  
        | objects applicable to SIP user agent and SIP stateful proxies  
        | 
        + sipCommonStatsSummary

        | Cancel, Options and /Register methods. 
        | 
        + sipCommonStatusCode 
        | This object group defines a table indicating the number of 
        | SIP responses in/out per class of response (1xx, 2xx, etc.) 
        | 
        + sipCommonStatsTrans 
        | This object group defines a table containing a gauge   
        | reflecting the number of transactions currently awaiting             
        | definitive responses by the managed SIP entity. 
        | 
        + sipCommonStatsRetry 
        | This object group defines statistic objects indicating the       
        | number of retries sent on a per method basis.

          This object group defines accessible-for-notify objects 
          that are relate to the SNMP notifications defined in this 
          MIB module. 
 
 
    The SIP-COMMON-MIB also contains notifications, including: 
        + sipStatusCodeNotif  
        | indicates that a specific status code has been sent or  
        | received by the system. 
        |  
        + sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif  
        | indicates that a specific status code has been sent or  
        | received by the system enough to exceed the configured  
        | threshold.

      sipUAMIBObjects 
        | 
        + sipUACfgSipServer 
          This group specifies SIP server configuration objects 
          applicable to SIP user agents including the Internet address  
          of the SIP Server to use to proxy or redirect calls. 
        
   To conform with this specification, an SNMP agent MUST implement 
   SIP-TC, plus the SIP-COMMON-MIB and one of the SIP entity-type-
   specific MIB modules (SIP-SERVER-MIB or SIP-UA-MIB) as applicable 
   for each instance of a SIP entity being managed.  If a device has 
   more than one SIP entity or multiple instances of the same entity, 
   type it MUST implement multiple SIP modules. Section 4.2 describes 
   handling of multiple instances in detail. 
    
4.1. Textual Conventions 
    
   The data type SipTransportProtocol is used as textual conventions in 
   this document.  These textual conventions have NO effect on either

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                      June 2003 
    
   the syntax or the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined 
   using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules 
   that define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or 
   the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions, 
   which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers. 
    
    
4.2. Relationship to the Network Services MIB   
    
   There is a requirement to be able to support multiple instances of 
   various SIP MIB modules in the context of a single system having a 
   single SNMP agent.        
        
   This requirement is solved by using the framework provided by the 
   NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB, RFC 2788 [RFC2788]. A device implementing the 
   SIP MIB MUST support the NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB and, at a minimum, it 
   MUST support the applIndex and applName objects in applTable.  The 
   following applName conventions will be adopted: 
    
       o for a SIP Proxy entity, applName MUST be equal to "sip_proxy" 
       o for a SIP Redirect entity, applName MUST be equal to 
          "sip_redirect" 
       o for a SIP Registrar entity, applName MUST be equal to 
          "sip_registrar" 
       o for a SIP User Agent entity, applName MUST be equal to 
          "sip_ua" 
       o for any combination of Proxy, Registrar, or Redirect Server 
         being managed as a single aggregate entity, the applName for  
         the combined server entity MUST reflect the appropriate 
         combination. For example, "sip_proxy_redirect" or  
         "sip_proxy_registrar". 
    
   The SNMP agent MAY support any combination of the other attributes 
   in applTable.  If the following objects are supported, the object 
   values SHOULD be populated as follows: 
    
       o applVersion: version of the SIP application. 
       o applUptime: value MUST be identical to sipServiceStartTime 
          defined in the SIP-COMMON-MIB module, 
       o applOperStatus: value SHOULD reflect the operational status 
          defined in sipServiceOperStatus, at least by means of a 
          mapping, 
       o applLastChange: value MUST be identical to 
          sipServiceLastChange defined in the SIP-COMMON module. 
    
   Note: There are a number of other objects in the applTable.  They 
   are not included for the sake of brevity and for the fact that they 
   do not enhance the concept being presented. 
    
    
   Example 1:

   The tables below illustrate how a system acting as both Proxy and 
   Registrar server might be configured to maintain separate SIP-
   COMMON-MIB instances. 
   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows: 
    
    
    
      applIndex | applName        | applDescription 
      ----------+-----------------+------------------------------ 
          1     | "sip_proxy"     | "ACME SIP Proxy" 
      ----------+-----------------+------------------------------ 
          2     | "sip_registrar" | "ACME SIP Registrar" 
      ----------+-----------------+------------------------------        
    
   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have two rows: one for 
   the proxy (applIndex=1) and one for the registrar (applIndex=2).  
   The SIP-SERVER-MIB tables would, however, only be populated with one 
   row  indexed by applIndex=1 and applIndex=2 respectively if the 
   server provides either proxy or registrar. 
    
   SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable might be populated as: 
    
      applIndex | sipProtocolVersion | sipServiceOperStatus | ... 
      ----------+--------------------+----------------------+---- 
          1     |     "SIP/2.0"      |      up(1)           | 
      ----------+--------------------+----------------------+---- 
          2     |     "SIP/2.0"      |      restarting(4)   | 
      ----------+--------------------+----------------------+---- 
    
   while sipProxyCfgTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated as: 
    
      applIndex | sipRequestMaxExpires | sipProxyStatefulness | ... 
      ----------+----------------------+----------------------+---- 
          1     |        3600          | stateless(1)         | 
      ----------+----------------------+----------------------+---- 
    
   and sipRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated as: 
    
      applIndex | sipUserIndex |   sipUserUri             | ... 
      ----------+--------------+--------------------------+----

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB assocTable is not considered a requirement 
   for SIP systems.  It is not a mandatory group for NETWORK-SERVICES-
   MIB compliance.       
    
   The relationship between the value of applOperStatus and 
   sipServiceOperStatus is as follows: 
        sipServiceOperStatus      applOperStatus 
        --------------------      -------------- 
                up           -->       up 
                down         -->       down 
                congested    -->       congested 
                restarting   -->       restarting 
                quiescing    -->       quiescing  
                testing      -->       up 
                unknown      -->       --indeterminate--
                                                       -
                                                        -

   If the sipOperStatus is √Êunknown√∆ there is no corresponding value of 
   applOperStatus.  Therefore, the last known value of applOperStatus 
   SHOULD be maintained until the sipOperStatus transitions to a value 
   that can be mapped appropriately. 
    
    
4.3. Accommodating SIP Extension Methods 
    
   The core set of SIP methods is defined in RFC3261.  Other Internet-
   Draft documents and RFCs define additional methods.  In the future 
   more methods may be defined.  In order to avoid having to update the 
   SIP-COMMON-MIB module to accommodate these extension methods, there 
   are various extension method tables throughout the MIB module.  
   There is no per method objects defined in the other MIB modules. 
    
   The sipExtMethodSupportedTable is the main table for listing all of 
   the extension methods supported by a system.  The table is 
   informational in nature and populated by the system.  Entries cannot 
   be added or deleted by a SNMP manager.  The other extension method 
   tables in the MIB are augmentations of this table. 
    
   The other extension method tables defined in the SIP-COMMON-MIB are: 
   sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable, sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodTable, 
   sipStatsExtMethodTable, and sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodTable.

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                      June 2003 
    
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions      
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet       
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 3261 (June       
                 2002).      
     
                 This MIB is defined for managing objects which are      
                 common to SIP User Agents (UAs), Proxy and Redirect       
                 Servers, and Registrars.  Objects specific to each of      
                 these entities MAY be managed using entity specific      
                 MIBs defined in other modules.      
         
                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a      
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).      
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.      
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a      
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on      
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or      
                 redirects the request.      
            
                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.      
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either      
                 responding to them or passing them on to other      
                 servers, possibly after modification.      
            
                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and      
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. Unlike      
                 a Proxy Server it does not initiate requests.  Unlike      
                 a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.      
            
                 A Registrar Server accepts REGISTER requests.   
                 A Registrar Server is typically co-located with a      
                 Proxy or Redirect Server.

                a row in its sipFtrSupportedTable containing the string      
                'com.example.billing'.  Similarly, a server which is

           DESCRIPTION      
                "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA)   
                 MIB module.      
                          
                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for       
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia       
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions      
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet       
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 3261 (June       
                 2002).      
                          
                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a      
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).      
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.      
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a      
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on      
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or      
                 redirects the request.

              DESCRIPTION      
                   "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Server MIB  
                    module.      
               
                    SIP is an application-layer signaling protocol for       
                    creating, modifying and terminating multimedia       
                    sessions with one or more participants. These  
                    sessions include Internet multimedia conferences  
                    and Internet telephone calls.  SIP is defined in  
                    RFC 3261 (June 2002).      
               
                    This MIB is defined for the management of SIP  
                    Proxy, Redirect, and Registrar Servers.      
               
                    A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.      
                    It accepts requests from other clients, either      
                    responding to them or passing them on to other      
                    servers, possibly after modification.      
               
                    A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and      
                    returns zero or more addresses to that client.   
                    Unlike a User Agent Server it does not accept  
                    calls.     
           
                    A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER      
                    requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with  
                    a Proxy or Redirect Server.

                   proxy forwards every request it receives downstream

                   A transaction stateful proxy, or simply a 'stateful

                   client and server transaction state machines during  
                   the processing of a request. A (transaction)  
                   stateful proxy is not the same as a call stateful  
                   proxy. If the value if this object is  
                   transactionStateful(2), the proxy is stateful on a  
                   transaction basis.   
    
                   A call stateful proxy is a logical entity if it  
                   retains state for a dialog from the initiating \  
                   INVITE to the terminating BYE request.  A call  
                   stateful proxy is always transaction stateful, but  
                   the converse is not necessarily true. If the value  
                   of this object is callStateful(3), the proxy is call

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                      June 2003 
    
     treated as any SIP extension method. 
    
   o Changed requirements verbs from lowercase to uppercase wherever  
     appropriate. 
    
   o Added RFC Editor notes. 
    
   o Updated all REFERENCE clauses and DESCRIPTIONS from RFC 2543  
     to RFC 3261. 
    
   o Explained the approach taken for extension methods that might be  
     defined in the future. 
    
   o Defined a mapping of sipServiceOperStatus to applOperStatus. 
    
   o Enhanced Security section with details on various objects. 
    
   o Added descriptive language to various Entry objects regarding  
     the expected persistence of data across system restarts. 
     
    
    
   SIP-COMMON-MIB 
    
   o Removed sipTransactionTable after input from SIP community. 
    
   o Made all extension method tables augmentations of 
     sipExtMethodSupportedTable.  This resulted in the removal  
     of the following objects: sipCfgTimerExtMethodName,  
     sipCfgRetryExtMethodName, sipStatsExtMethodName, 
     sipStatsRetryExtMethodName. 
    
   o sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode default value changed to 
     'triggered'. 
    
   o sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif was replaced by two  
     notifications: sipStatusCodeThreshExceededOutNotif & 
     sipStatusCodeThreshExceededInNotif. 
    
   o Re-arranged the enumerated value of sipServiceOperStatus; making 
     'unknown' the first value.   Added some words to the DESCRIPTION 
     of that object stating the values are not based on anything in 
     the SIP standard. 
    
   o Clarified rules for capitalization of sipExtMethodName. 
    
   o All counters in the MIB are consistent with respect to  
     resetting to zero.  No counters can be reset to zero. 
     Entries in sipStatusCodesTable can simply be created or  
     destroyed - no ability to set to 'notInService' where there 
     was the question/possibility of resetting the counters to zero. 
     sipStatsExtMethodTable no longer has it√∆s own RowStatus object, 
     so it too can no longer be set to 'notInService∆ where there 
     was the question/possibility of resetting the counters to zero.

     sipStatsExtMethodTable rows are augmentations of  
     sipExtMethodSupportedEntry. 
    
   o OBJECT refinement for sipStatusCodeRowStatus added to compliance. 
    
   o Clarified the relationship between  
     sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode and sipCommonStatusCodeNotifSend. 
    
   o Explained the existence of sipNotifApplIndex object better. 
    
   o sipCfgExpiresStatusCodeValue syntax changed from INTEGER to   
     Unsigned32. 
    
   o sipEntityType object added to sipCommonCfgTable. 
    
   o All accessible-for-notify objects are moved into  
     sipCommonNotifObjects group.  OIDs for actual notifications  
     are re-assigned as a result. 
    
   o sipNotifSequenceNumber accessible-for-notify object added as a 
     way for managers to gain insight into possible missed  
     notifications.  It is bound to each notification defined in  
     the MIB. 
    
   o New notifications related to SIP service operational status are  
     added: sipServiceColdStart, sipServiceWarmStart, &  
     sipServiceLastChanged. 
    
   o New object sipServiceNotifEnable added to control the new SIP  
     related notifications. 
    
   o Minor object descriptor changes: 
     sipStatusCodesTable renamed to sipStatusCodeClassesTable 
     SipStatusCodesEntry renamed to SipStatusCodeClassesEntry 
     sipStatusCodesEntry renamed to sipStatusCodeClassesEntry 
     sipCommonStatusCodeTable renamed to sipStatusCodesTable

     sipStatsRetryInfos 
    
   o Clarifying words added to sipStatusCodeNotifTable  
     DESCRIPTION to explain why it's a seperate table from 
     sipStatusCodesTable. 
    
 
     
    
    
   SIP-SERVER-MIB 
    
   o Deleted objects related to 'action∆ parameter. 
     RFC 3261 section 10.2 deprecates the 'action∆ parameter  
     => deleted 3 objects: 
      - sipServerContactDfltAction, sipServerRespectUAAction 
      - sipContactAction. 
    
   o Deleted pgp-related objects. 
     RFC 3261 section 23 deprecates use of pgp 
     => deleted 3 objects: 
      - sipProxyAuthPgpAlgorithm, sipPgpPrivateKey, sipPgpVersion. 
    
   o Removed sipProxyStateTimeout object. 
     Timers G and timer H have been introduced in RFC 3261 for this  
     purpose (see RFC 3261 section 17.2.1). 
    
   o Updated description clause of sipProxyStatefulness. 
     The 3 definitions of stateless/statefulness now match the text  
     in RFC 3261. 
    
   o Changed DEFVAL for object sipProxyProvideAlternatives. 
     Changed DEFVAL to true to align with RFC 3261 that states that 485  
     responses SHOULD contain a contact header & 303 MAY... and updated  
     REFERENCE clause to "RFC 3261 Sections 13.2.2.2 and 16.5". 
    
   o Removed basic authentication value from sipProxyAuthMethod object 
     Per section 22 of rfc 3261, deprecated. 
    
   o Changed SYNTAX of sipProxyNonceLifeTime from Integer32 to  
     Unsigned32. 
    
   o Updated description clause of sipRegDfltRegActiveInterval 
     Per RFC 3261 Section 10.2. 
    
   SIP-UA-MIB 
    
   o OBJECT refinement for sipUACfgSipServerStatus added to compliance. 
    
   o Changed the object descriptors of sipUACfgSipServerAddrIndex to  
     sipUACfgSipServerIndex, and sipUACfgSipServerAddrStatus to  
     sipUACfgSipServerStatus.

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                      June 2003 
    
    
    
   o  Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-04 
    
   Started realignment with SIP RFC3261. 
    
   o  Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-03 
    
   These are the specific draft-ietf-sip-mib-04 changes to the MIB 
   modules based on what they looked like for draft-ietf-sip-mib-03. 
    
    
   Front paper/Back paper 
       o Rewrote parts of section 4.2 
       o Fixed minor editorial nits 
    
   SIP-COMMON-MIB 
    
   o CONTACT-INFO "SIP MIB email" changed to sip@ietf.org 
    
   o sipInviteTimeout was removed from the MIB.  See below regarding 
   new sipCommonCfgExpires objects.  They provide equivalent 
   functionality with extensibility beyond INVITE. 
    
   o sipCommonCfgExpires OID subtree added.  Per method Expires 
   configuration objects were added there. 
   This new high-level OID was placed under the existing  
   sipCommonCfgRetry OID and therefore, caused the OIDs for the 
   subsequent groups to change (incrementing by one). 
    
   o Objects from tables under sipCommonCfgExpires were added to a new 
   OBJECT-GROUP sipCommonConfigExpiresGroup, and that group was listed 
   as optional in sipCommonCompliance. 
    
   o Minor DESCRIPTION change for sipCommonCfgEntry.  No behavior 
   change. 
    
   o sipServiceOperStatus SYNTAX changed. 
     New values added: congested & quiescing 
     Old values removed: halted 
     The order of the enumeration was altered as well. 
    
   o sipServiceAdminStatus SYNTAX changed. 
     New values added: noop, up, down, quieseSessions, and 
                       quieseApplications 
     Old values removed: shutdown, restart, stop, rts. 
     These changes were made based on comments from last call reviewer 
   and general known ambiguities in the previous design of the object. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipServiceStartTime. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipOrganization. 
    
   o Clarification of behavior for sipPortStatus while row is

     'active'. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipUriSupportedTable 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTIONs of sipFtrSupportedTable, 
     sipFtrSupportedEntry, and sipFtrSupported. 
     Specifically, IETF standard features and non-standard features are 
   now represented by this table.  Only non-standard features were 
   mentioned in prior revisions of the draft. 
    
   o Reference to usage of RFC 2788 applIndex moved from  
     sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable to 
   sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry. 
     This was the convention for other table/entry definitions in 
     the MIB, so these objects were previously unconventional. 
    
   o DEFVAL removed from sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer.  The generic nature 
     of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being able to 
     specify a particular default value. 
    
   o Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from  
   sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer,  
     a value for that object must be specified when creating a  
     sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry.  The description of  
     sipCfgTimerExtMethodStatus was updated to reflect this. 
    
   o sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodTable is now properly defined under 
     sipCommonCfgRetry OID space instead of under sipCommonCfgTimer 
     OID space. 
    
   o DEFVAL removed from sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry.  The generic nature 
     of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being able to 
     specify a particular default value. 
    
   o Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from  
   sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry,  
     a value for that object must be specified when creating a  
     sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodEntry.  The description of  
     sipCfgRetryExtMethodStatus was updated to reflect this. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of 
   sipSummaryTotalTransactions. 
     Specifically, the object is not applicable to stateless SIP proxy  
     servers and the object should always return a value of 0 if  
     implemented by a stateless proxy. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipStatsExtMethodStatus. 
      
   o sipStatsOtherClassesIns and sipStatsOtherClassesOuts counter 
     objects were added to sipStatusCodesTable to handle possible 
     future classes of response status codes. 
    
   o Text referring specifically to Redirect Server in  
     sipStatsRedirClassIns and sipStatsRedirClassOuts was removed.

   o Text defining protocol behavior in sipStatsServerFailClassIns, 
     sipStatsServerFailClassOuts, sipStatsGlobalFailClassIns, and 
     sipStatsGlobalFailClassOuts was removed. 
    
   o sipCommonStatusCodeNotifInterval SYNTAX changed from TimeTicks 
     to Unsigned32 w/ a UNITS of "seconds" added to the definition. 
     DEFVAL clause changed accordingly. 
    
   o sipStatusCodeNotifTo, sipStatusCodeNotifFrom,  
   sipStatusCodeNotifCallId, 
     and sipStatusCodeNotifCSeq all had clarifying changes to their 
     DESCRIPTIONs.  Specifically, the header name will be part of the 
     object value and example values were given. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipCurrentTransTable 
     and sipTransactionTable.  Specifically, these tables are not  
     applicable to transaction stateless SIP Proxy Servers. 
    
   o Minor gramatical change to the DESCRIPTION of 
   sipCurrentTransEntry. 
    
   o sipTransMethod and sipTransActivityInfo objects were added to  
     sipTransactionTable while sipTransCallingPartyContentType and  
     sipTransCalledPartyContentType were removed. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipTransState. 
     Specifically, noting that not all values of the object 
     are applicable to all transaction types. 
    
   o sipTransTo, sipTransFrom, sipTransCallId, and sipTransCSeq  
     all had clarifying changes to their DESCRIPTIONs.   
     Specifically, the header name will be part of the object 
     value and example values were given. 
    
   o Minor gramatical change to the DESCRIPTION of sipOtherStatsEntry. 
    
   o sipCommonStatusCodeIns and sipCommonStatusCodeOuts objects were 
     added to the varbind of sipStatusCodeNotif. 
    
   o Appropriate changes were made to sipCommonStatsGroup OBJECT-GROUP 
     based on objects being added and/or removed from the MIB. 
    
    
    
   SIP-SERVER-MIB 
    
   o CONTACT-INFO "SIP MIB email" changed to sip@ietf.org 
    
   o The statement "Unlike a Proxy server it does not initiate 
     requests." was removed from where a Redirect Server is 
     defined in the MIB's DESCRIPTION. 
    
   o sipServerMIBNotifs OID removed. No notifications were

   o Clarifying text added to all of the Table DESCRIPTIONS 
     stating that the value of applIndex used in this MIB 
     corresponds to the value of applIndex used in the 
     SIP-COMMON-MIB. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipProxyStatefulness. 
    
   o sipContactPreference SYNTAX changed from OCTET STRING to  
     SnmpAdminString.

   o sipUAMIBNotifs OID removed. No notifications were  
     ever defined under this subtree. 
    
   o sipUAStats OID removed. No notifications were  
     ever defined under this subtree. 
    
   o Clarifying text added to all of the Table DESCRIPTIONS 
     stating that the value of applIndex used in this MIB 
     corresponds to the value of applIndex used in the 
     SIP-COMMON-MIB. 
    
    
   SIP-TC 
    
   o CONTACT-INFO "SIP MIB email" changed to sip@ietf.org 
    
    
    
    
    
    
   o  Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-02 
    
   The following changes were made based on review comments to the 
   previous version of the draft. 
    
   In general 
       o Eliminated the SIP-MIB-SMI modules.  Each MIB module will now  
         get it's own IANA OID. 
       o Top-level OID subtrees restructured in each MIB. 
       o General cleanup/removal of "placeholder" OID subtrees 
         for object groups and notifications that never materialized. 
    
   Regarding SIP-COMMON-MIB

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                      June 2003 
    
       o sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodEntry was missing its INDEX  
         clause. 
       o sipNumUnsupportedUris OID was "5" when it was the 
         only object in the table.  OID is now "1". 
       o High-level OID structure of the MIB is now sequential. 
       o Incorrect object descriptor for sipCfgInitialTimerRsp 
         inconsistent with reference in compliance section. 
       o Inconsistencies between sipCommonStatsRetryGroup definition 
         and SipCommonStatsRetryEntry OBJECT-TYPE corrected. 
       o sipNotifApplIndex was not in any object group in the  
         conformance section. 
    
   Regarding SIP-SERVER-MIB 
       o Removed sipInformationTryingInterval. 
       o Removed sipRxProxyAuthTable.

       o Removed sipRegContactDfltExpiryDuration. 
       o Removed sipUserPassword. 
       o sipRequestMaxExpires DESCRIPTION changed to no  
         longer specifically mention 400 response. 
       o sipProxyStateful object descriptor changed to 
         sipProxyStatefullness and the SYNTAX changed 
         from TruthValue to an enumerated INTEGER. 
       o sipProxyStateTimeout DESCRIPTION changed to now reflect only 
         INVITE. 
       o Gauge32 was not being IMPORTed. 
       o sipServerContactDfltAction showed up in conformance 
         and other object descriptions in an older form. 
       o sipServerHost replaced with InetAddressType/InetAddress 
         object pair (sipServerHostAddrType & sipServerHostAddr). 
    
   Regarding SIP-UA-MIB 
       o IMPORTed Unsigned32 to support sipUACfgSipServerAddrIndex. 
       o sipUACfgSipServerEntry was referencing the wrong 
         auxilliary object and listing that object in the conformance 
         section. 
       o sipUACfgSipServerEntry listed sipUACfgSipServerStatus 
         when it should have been listing sipUACfgSipServerAddrStatus. 
       o SIP-UA-MIB IMPORTed Counter32, but never used it. 
         Removed the IMPORT of Counter32. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.   
    
   These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o   SIP-COMMON-MIB 
    
   The following read-write object is used to control the overall SIP 
   service in any SIP entity: 
        sipServiceAdminStatus 
   If this object is SET maliciously, it may result in unwanted 
   operational status, or a failure to obtain SIP services. 
    
   The following read-write and read-create objects are used to control 
   the behavior of the SIP protocol as exhibited by a SIP entity: 
        sipOrganization, 
        sipRequestUriHostMatching, 
        sipCfgTimerA, 
        sipCfgTimerB, 
        sipCfgTimerC, 
        sipCfgTimerD, 
        sipCfgTimerE, 
        sipCfgTimerF, 
        sipCfgTimerG, 
        sipCfgTimerH, 
        sipCfgTimerI, 
        sipCfgTimerJ, 
        sipCfgTimerK, 
        sipCfgTimerT1, 
        sipCfgTimerT2, 
        sipCfgTimerT4, 
        sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer, 
        sipCfgRetryInvite, 
        sipCfgRetryBye, 
        sipCfgRetryCancel, 
        sipCfgRetryRegister, 
        sipCfgRetryOptions, 
        sipCfgRetryFinalResponse, 
        sipCfgRetryNonFinalResponse, 
        sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry, 
        sipCfgExpiresInvite,   
        sipCfgExpiresRegister,   
        sipCfgExpiresHeaderMethod, 
        sipCfgExpiresHeaderValue, 
        sipCfgExpiresStatusCodeStatus, 
   If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in incorrect or 
   unwanted protocol operation. 
    
   The following read-create object is used to configure the status 
   code statistics that will be monitored by the SIP entity: 
        sipStatusCodeRowStatus 
   If this object is SET maliciously, it may result in an over 
   allocation of resources in a system for the purpose of accumulating 
   and maintaining statistics. 
    
   The following read-write objects are used to configure the behavior 
   of certain SNMP notifications potentially generated by a SIP entity: 
        sipStatusCodeNotifSend,

        sipStatusCodeNotifThresh,     
        sipStatusCodeNotifInterval, 
        sipServiceNotifEnable 
   If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in a system 
   and/or network performance impact due to the generation of SNMP 
   notifications. 
    
    
   o   SIP-UA-MIB 
    
   The following read-create objects are used to configure the Internet 
   address of SIP servers a SIP User Agent will use to proxy/redirect 
   SIP calls:     
       sipUACfgSipServerAddrType, 
       sipUACfgSipServerAddr, 
       sipUACfgSipServerStatus. 
   If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in unwanted 
   operation, or a failure to obtain SIP services from the user agent 
   prospective or even theft of service. In particular, setting the 
   SipUACfgSipServerStatus object instance to the √Êdestroy√∆ value may 
   result in service disruption. 
    
 
   o   SIP-SERVER-MIB 
    
   The following read-create objects are managed by Registrar Servers 
   and contain sensitive or private information about the address of 
   record of registered users. 
      sipUserUri 
      sipUserTableRowStatus 
   The sensitivity of these objects depends on the role that Registrar 
   Servers play in the SIP service. In some cases, these objects, if 
   SET maliciously, may allow unregistered users to steal service, or 
   may prevent registered users from accessing the SIP service.   
    
   The following read-write objects, if SET maliciously will have an 
   immediate serious impact on the service: 
      sipServerHostAddrType & sipServerHostAddr -
                                                - these objects specify 
   the host part of the URI for the server providing the SIP resource 
   and it is widely used by SIP servers in numerous header lines and 
   field. For e.g., the host address may be used with the Request-URI 
   to check if the server is the one resolved by the Request-URI, 
   therefore determining whether to process or forward the request in 
   the case of outbound proxies, or, as an another common example, it 
   is used by Proxy Servers acting as strict routers to rewrite the 
   Request-URI. Setting these objects with improper values may result 
   in serious service interference or failure. 
      sipRequestMaxExpires and sipRegMaxContactExpiryDuration: if set 
   to a zero value and either SIP requests contain an Expires header or 
   Contact header contain an expires parameter, may cause the server to 
   never create bindings associated with an address of record (case of 
   REGISTER request) or may cause server to expire and cancel 
   invitations (case of INVITE request).

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                      June 2003 
    
      sipProxyStatefulness: changing the value of this object affects 
   how transaction states are being handled the Proxy Server and may 
   result in call feature or service changes. 
      SipProxyAuthMethod: this object specifies at a maximum what the 
   authentication methods that may be used by a server. If this object 
   is SET maliciously, it may alter how the level of security used by 
   the server to generate requests and may compromise the network 
   security policies. 
      sipRegAllowThirdParty: depending on the authentication policy 
   associated with registration services, setting this object 
   maliciously to √Êtrue√∆ may allow theft of identity or service.  
      sipProxyAuthRealm: if this object is SET improperly, and if the 
   HTTP Digest authentication method is used, it may result in clients 
   being unable to authenticate and ultimately, in the server denying 
   service. 
    
    
   The remaining read-write objects, if SET maliciously may have some 
   effect on the service: 
      SipProxySendsCancel: this is a configuration object defining how 
   a certain class of proxy servers (forking proxies) handle 
   cancellation of outstanding branch requests. If this object was set 
   to true and is maliciously changed to false, the impact is 
   considered moderate: the forking proxy may simply terminate the 
   outstanding branches at a later phase, either when a transaction 
   timer expires or when subsequent messages arrive from the 
   outstanding branches. 
      sipProxyRecordRoute: setting this object to true may cause 
   additional SIP traffic to cross the proxy server and may result in 
   message avalanches.  
   The threats posed by the following read-write objects can either be 
   mitigated by other configuration settings like read-only objects or 
   they are considered to cause additional server operations without 
   immediate impact on the server like additional location look-ups 
   (sipProxyProvideAlternatives), additional traffic due to expiration 
   of nonce (sipProxyNonceLifeTime). 
      sipProxyForwardAll1xx 
      sipProxyRecursion 
      sipProxyProvideAlternatives 
      sipProxyNonceLifeTime  
      sipRegDfltRegActiveInterval 
    
    
    
   Some of the readable objects in the MIB modules (i.e., objects with 
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP. 
    
    
   o   SIP-SERVER-MIB

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                      June 2003 
    
   The following object values may contain private or confidential 
   customer information like first name, last name, customer 
   identification, location, company affiliation, the time the 
   information was updated, etc. 
      SipContactDisplayName, 
      SipContactURI, 
      SipContactLastUpdated. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
