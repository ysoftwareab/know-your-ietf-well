Abstract

   This document discusses how to build the large-scale mobile IP
   network through the MPLS network. One small-scale mobile IP network
   could be connected to other networks through the MPLS backbone
   network.
        It proposes the MPLS network architecture to provide the large-
   scale mobile IP network. Specifically, it proposes that the label
   distribution protocol (LDP) can be applied to set up the Label
   switched path (LSP) tunnels between the mobile agents (that is,
   Foreign Agents and Home Agents)[3]. It means that the IP-in-IP
   tunnels can be replaced by one or multiple Label switched paths
   (LSPs) on the MPLS network.

1. Introduction

   A mobile node of a Mobile IP network may be connected to Foreign
   Mobile IP networks with a distance. The MPLS network can provide the
   backbone solution for high speed IP forwarding. The relevant label
   switched paths on the MPLS network can support proper quality-of-
   service (QoS) paths for differentiated mobile IP services. This
   document proposes the MPLS network architecture and tunneling
   procedures to support the mobile IP network. Similar concerns on the
   integration of MPLS network and Mobile IP network are also
   investigated in [8].

   The MPLS backbone network can build the large-scale mobile IP network.
   A mobile IP network is connected to other mobile IP network via the
   Label Edge Router (LER). To support Mobile IP services, The MPLS
   network have to accommodate Foreign Agent and Home Agent. The LER is
   capable of forwarding Mobile IP packets by encapsulating with
   relevant label header. The LER (Label Edge Router) would be a Foreign
   Agent or its corresponding node. For mobility support, the LER will
   be a gateway router for the corresponding mobile IP network. To
   support the hierarchical architecture, the Gateway FA or Regional FA
   could be defined on the MPLS network [4].

   For the control procedure, the label distribution protocol (LDP) may
   be extended to set up the Label switched path (LSP) tunnel between
   the mobile agents (that is, Foreign Agents and Home Agents) through
   the MPLS network [3]. The IP-in-IP tunnels of Mobile IP Network can
   be provided by the one or multiple LSPs through the MPLS network.
   When a mobile node is moving to the foreign area, the existing LSPs
   may be extended without service interrupt. The short-cut LSPs between
   source and destination mobile nodes may be recalculated to avoid the
   long cascaded connections.

   The Home Agent can be implemented on the relevant MPLS routers
   according to geographical area and routing path. There may be two
   types of scenarios according to location of Home Agent (HA). Scenario
   1 (we call it, Tunnel Extension) is a natural extension of the
   existing mobile IP protocol through the MPLS network. The MPLS
   network provides the LSP tunnels replaced by the IP-in-IP tunnels.
   Scenario 2 (we call it, Query Before Tunneling) is that the HA is
   attached at the LSR like a server since it couldnÆt intercept the
   incoming IP packets to forward the destination FA belonging to the
   visiting area of a mobile node.

   Scenario 1 (Tunnel Extension) is based on the existing scenario of
   Mobile IP service and the HA should be located at the LER [5],[6]. In
   this scenario, the IP-in-IP tunnels between HA and FA could be done
   with help of the LDP operation. There is no additional constraints on
   the existing protocols of mobile IP.

   Scenario 2 (Query Before Tunneling) is that the HA is attached or
   located at the Label Switching Router (LSR). It assumes that the LSR
   is not directly connected to the regional mobile IP network and the

Internet Draft      Draft-choi-mobileip-ldpext-00.txt      December 2000


   HA doesnÆt be capable to intercept the mobile IP packets for
   tunneling. In this case, the similar scenario with the existing
   cellular or IMT-2000 network using home location register/visit
   location register (HLR/VLR) can be applied. The ingress LER may query
   the care-of-address (CoA) of the egress LER/FA from the HA to find
   the direct short-cut path. The forwarding path should be pre-
   calculated by query process. The cache imposition or label binding
   operation may be done at the LER/FA.

   To deliver the mobile IP packets through the MPLS network, it
   requires the IP encapsulation [7]. Far from home location, the mobile
   node should be registered to the foreign LER with proper agent
   discovery process. The registration process should be also needed
   between the HA and the corresponding FA through the MPLS network.
   While a node tries to call the mobile node, data forwarding path with
   help of HA should be established between the source LER and the
   destination LERs. The label switched path (LSP) by the LDP operation
   would enable to label the IP packets and forwards them at the
   destination mobile node via the MPLS network.


2. The MPLS Network Architecture with Mobility Support

2.1. Assumptions and Requirements

   In order to provide the backbone solution for Mobile IP network, it
   considers the following assumptions on the MPLS network.

     - There is no additional requirements on the existing mobile IP
       protocol such as agent discovery, registration, and routing.
     - All the regional mobile IP networks should be connected at the
       LER which will be a external gateway router to communicate the
       external world.
     - In the MPLS backbone network, all the LERs are equipped with FA
       to identify the visiting mobile nodes. In case that a number of
       FAs are in a Mobile IP network, the FA attached to the LER has a
       responsibility to communicate to the external world.
     - The HA should be located at the LER or the LSR. If a small-scale
       mobile IP network already has a number of HAs to cover their own
       regional area, it should discriminate from the HAs interfaced to
       the MPLS network. The relevant registration procedure is required
       for the mobile IP network on a number of HA. A mobile node should
       register the HA interfaced to the MPLS network while moving to
       external world. It can extend the registration procedure of
       mobile IP service [5],[6].
     - The forwarding process on the MPLS network should be taken on the
       datagram IP traffic (the UDP traffic) as well as the stream-like
       IP traffic (the TCP traffic).

   Depending on the location of HA on the MPLS network, the following
   assumptions are required.

Internet Draft      Draft-choi-mobileip-ldpext-00.txt      December 2000


  - In Scenario 1 (Tunnel Extension), all the LERs have to operate the
    HA. It means that a mobile node should be identified both from the
    HA and the FA at visiting area while moving to foreign area [5],[6].
  - When a node sends the IP packets to the mobile node, the LER with HA
    intercepts and forward them to the corresponding LER/FA on
    temporarily visiting area.

  - In Scenario 2 (Query Before Tunneling), the HA is not located at the
    home LER. It means that the HA couldnÆt intercept IP packets. For
    this scenario, we assume that the data forwarding paths should be
    pre-calculated at the originating LER. When a node sends IP packets
    to the destination mobile IP node, the ingress LER has to decide
    whether forwarding to home area or not. Otherwise, it have to query
    from the HA to get the IP address of the destination LER/FA at a
    temporarily visit area.


2.2. Network Architecture and Service Scenarios

   The MPLS network to support mobile IP service doesnÆt use IP in IP
   encapsulation. The label switched path (LSP) tunnel provides a lower
   layer tunneling scheme independent on high layer applications. It
   notes that the IP-in-IP tunneling utilizes the layer 3 forwarding
   capability in IP routing. The ingress LER forwards IP packets all the
   way to the HA to the egress LER to the foreign mobile node. The whole
   forwarding process is done at the MPLS layer. The HA doesn't need to
   involve the IP layer forwarding to a mobile node.

   Since label header is much smaller than IP encapsulation header, the
   header overhead from HA to FA is also reduced. It can improve the
   scalability of mobile IP protocol. Moreover, an LSP satisfying the
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and traffic engineering could
   be set up with Constraint-Based Label Distribution Protocol (CR-LDP)
   or RSVP-TE [9],[10].

   Figure 1 shows the MPLS network architecture using Scenario 1 (Tunnel
   Extension). In this scenario the HA is located at the LER1 and has a
   capability to intercept IP packets for a mobile node. When a mobile
   node from the LER1/HA area is temporarily moving to the LER2 area,
   the registration is required to HA via LER2/FA2. When a node at LER3
   sends IP packets to a current mobile node, the LSP tunnels would be
   established from LER3 to LER1 and cascading from LER1 to LER2. The
   relevant LDP operations will be taken with associations of Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC). When a mobile node is moving to the LER4/FA2
   area during active service time, the LSP tunnel from LER1 to LER2
   should be extended or re-configured to LER4 with update on HA, FA1
   and FA2. The seamless LSP tunnel to LER4 may be required for the
   real-time applications.

   To encapsulate IP packets with a MPLS header, the destination address
   of the MPLS header is initially the LER2. The MPLS label stack
   operation may cut through the corresponding address of the tunnel's
   receive endpoint. If the ingress point of the LSP tunnel wishes to

   put a labeled packet into the MPLS network, it should replace the
   label value at the top of the stack with a label value that was
   distributed to it by the tunnel's receive endpoint. Then it must push
   on the label which corresponds to the tunnel itself, as distributed
   to it by the next hop along the tunnel. To allow this, the tunnel
   endpoints should be explicit label distribution peers.

      Figure 1. The MPLS Network Architecture with Mobility Support
                     (Scenario 1 : Tunnel Extension)


   In this scenario, the functions of correspondent agents, FA, can be
   located in the LERs. The LSPs can be setup the same way as "tunnels"
   are setup between correspondent agents and foreign agents. Since an
   LSP can be setup between a correspondent agent and a foreign agent
   (the LERs), this allows for traffic aggregation between the LERs. In
   addition it allows constrained based routing and the QoS path between
   the agents can be guaranteed. The establishment of these LSPs can be
   triggered by the Binding Update messages, by data transmitted,
   configured a priori or by other means.

   In the registration procedure, the mobile node (MN) determines
   whether it is at home or in a foreign network when it receives agent
   advertisement messages broadcast by the mobility agents. If the MN
   determines that it is in a foreign network, the MN acquires a

   temporary CoA from FA and sends a registration request to FA. Since
   FA is an edge LER, it will analyze the incoming registration request
   message and get the destination address of the request. Then, FA
   updates its routing table with the value of MN home address. In
   addition, it sets the outgoing port value of this entry to be the
   incoming port number from which it received the registration request.
   Based on the IP routing table, FA forwards the registration request
   message toward HA.

   The registration request message is forwarded to HA using normal IP
   hop-by-hop routing. When HA gets the registration request message and
   learns the CoA, it searches its label table to find the table with
   the MN home address as Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). Then, it
   will send a label request using CR-LDP to FA with the CoA as FEC. FA
   replies with an LDP label mapping message to HA. When this label
   mapping message arrives at HA, the LSP would have been established.

   After that, HA changes its label table that uses the MN home address
   as FEC. It sets the outgoing port entries of the LSP from HA to FA.
   In this way, HA can relay the packets destined to MN home address to
   its current location in the foreign network. Finally, HA sends a
   registration reply to FA along the LSP from HA to FA. When FA
   receives the registration reply, it records the incoming port number
   and in label value of the reply message.

   Packets from a node to the MN are addressed to the MN home address.
   If the MN is located in a foreign network, packets are intercepted by
   the HA. HA uses the incoming label value as an index to look up its
   label table. HA inserts the label value in the label table into
   packet and sends it out through the port indicated in the table. If
   MN is still in the home network, then outgoing port entries are empty.
   The packet will be sent to the IP layer and sent out from the port
   indicated in the corresponding routing table entry. The first packet
   is delivered from HA to FA along the LSP (LER1-LSR1-LSR2-LER2) by
   label swapping. FA receives the first packet and looks up its label
   table. Since it is the egress of the LSP from HA to FA and the
   outgoing port entries are empty, FA strips off the label and sends
   the packets to the IP layer. Finally, FA forwards the packet to MN
   based on the newly-added host specific routing table. MN receives the
   packet sent by a originating node. Directly after delivering the
   first packet, HA transmits the CoA of MN to the ingress LER. After
   the LER of FN receives the CoA of MN form HA, the new LSP (LER3-LSR1-
   LSR2-LER2) between the LER and FA is established. From the next
   packet, the LER is directly delivered to FA using the newly-
   established LSP tunnel which is reduced the distance of FN and MN.

   When MN moves from one FA to another, the registration procedure is
   repeated once between the HA and new FA. The existing LSP should be
   changed to the new FA. The following issues are further considered on
   the MPLS network.

       - Path rerouting
       - Path extension

      Figure 2. The MPLS Network Architecture with Mobility Support
                  (Scenario 2 : Query Before Tunneling)


   Figure 2 shows the MPLS network architecture using Scenario 2 (Query
   Before Tunneling). In this scenario, the HA is attached at the LSR
   and is not capable to intercept IP packets. But, the registration
   procedure is the same with Scenario 1. According to geographical area
   and routing path, HA may cover more than one regional Mobile IP
   networks.

   The tunneling procedure of this model might be different from that of
   Scenario 1. When a FN at LER3 sends packets to a MN located in the
   foreign area, the ingress LER (LER3) has to decide the relevant
   forwarding path depending on routing information. There are three
   alternatives to forward IP packets.

      case (a) home IP address of a MN as default forwarding path
      case (b) HA address of the MN
      case (c) CoA address of the MN, that is, egress LER/FA as
               tunneling receive endpoint of MN

   For the case (a), the additional processing on the home LER is
   required since the UDP traffic tries to take the default path without
   reservation of label flow. In case (b), the HA address should be
   already known by all network elements and there is no advantage to
   locate at the LSR. It requires for further study.

   It is preferable of case (c) that the forwarding path from ingress
   LER should be cut through the egress LER/FA, the CoA of the MN. For
   all the cases, the ingress LER should find forwarding path with
   relevant query process. The query process is depending on whether the
   destination is a mobile user or not. It may cause that this scenario
   is not applicable to IPv4 network without relevant procedure since
   the IPv4 address structure is not capable of identifying mobile
   terminal. For IPv6, it seems to be applicable when some address
   spaces are dedicated for mobile. One possible application for this
   scenario may be the MPLS-based IMT-2000 Network using Ipv6.

   For this scenario, it requires the query process to find the
   destination tunnel endpoints on the MPLS network. The LER decides
   whether destinations are for mobile application. And it tries to look
   up their label table for incoming packets. When the relevant port
   entries and labels are found, it sends them to the output port with a
   label header. If no entry is returned, it sends the query messages to
   the HA dealing with destination IP address. For the UDP traffic, it
   also requires the query process on destination address to assign the
   default label value. Then, the incoming IP packets may wait for
   several seconds to get the address of egress LER/FA.

   For the matters of QoS and traffic control, it should investigate
   whether the bandwidths between ingress LER and egress LER are
   available or not. With these concerns, the CR-LDP or RSVP-TE may be
   useful to take a relevant forwarding path.

   The detail discussions on Query Before Tunneling scenario require for
   further study.


2.3. Routing Considerations

   The routing on the MPLS network is depending on locations of HA and
   FA. In MPLS network, through flow classification, each flow may be
   different in grades of service. An LSP should meet certain QoS
   requirements of differential flows using CR-LDP or RSVP-TE.

   The detail discussions on routing issues of the MPLS network with
   mobility support are further study.


2.4. Interworking of existing Mobile IP network

   It requires for further study.

3. Description of the Protocol

3.1. General Assumptions

   In this draft, the main issues of MPLS network architecture with
   mobility support are focused on the control procedure such as
   registration, agent discovery, LSP establishment and LSP Extension,
   etc. Agent advertisement and discovery within the scope of regional
   mobile IP network are beyond the scope of this document. We assume
   that the FAs support security associations

   We also assume on the mobile wireless IP networks that are divided
   into a number of cell regions according to geographical area. Each
   cell is covered by a Base Station (BS) which provides wireless IP
   access to the MN. The BS is connected to the LER to support mobility.


3.2. LSP Tunnels for Mobility Support

   There requires two types of LSP tunnels in the MLPS network with
   mobility support;

     - LSP tunnels between the ingress LER and HA
     - LSP tunnels between HA and egress LER/FA
     - Direct LSP tunnels between ingress LER and egress LER/FA
       (scenario 2)

   The existing LDP specification is well described to establish LSP
   tunnels for mobility. The address of HA and FA for LSP tunnels will
   be given by the Agent Discovery Procedure within the MPLS network.

   The LSP with QoS constraints will be contained in the CR-LDP or RSVP-
   TE specification [9],[10].


3.3. Registration of Mobile Node

   MN determines whether it is at home or in a foreign network when it
   receives agent advertisement messages broadcast by the mobility
   agents. If the MN determines that it is in a foreign network, the MN
   acquires a temporary CoA from FA and sends a registration request to
   FA. Since FA is an LER, it will analyze the incoming registration
   request message and get the destination address of the HA. Then FA
   updates its routing table and adds a host specific row with the label
   value of MN home address. In addition, it sets the outgoing port
   value of this entry to be the incoming port number from which it
   received the registration request.

        Figure 3. Registration of Mobile Node at the MPLS Network

   Based on the IP routing table, FA forwards the registration request
   message toward HA. The request message is forwarded to HA in a hop-
   by-hop manner using normal IP routing. When HA gets the registration
   request message and learns the CoA, it searches its label table to
   find the row with the MN home address as Forwarding Equivalence Class
   (FEC). Then, it will send a label request using CR-LDP to FA with the
   CoA as FEC. FA replies with an LDP label mapping message to HA. When
   this label mapping message arrives at HA, the LSP would have been
   established.

   After that, HA changes the row in its label table that uses the MN
   home address as FEC. It sets the empty out label and outgoing port
   entries to the values of out label and outgoing port of the LSP from
   HA to FA. In this way, HA can relay the packets destined to MN home
   address to its current location in the foreign network. Finally, HA
   sends a registration reply to FA along the LSP from HA to FA. When FA
   receives the registration reply, it records the incoming port number
   and in label value of the reply message. Then it adds a new row in
   its label table.


3.4. Agent Advertisement and Solicitation

   Mobile agents (i.e., foreign agents and home agents) advertise their
   presence via Agent Advertisement messages. A mobile node may
   optionally solicit an Agent Advertisement message from any locally
   attached mobility agents through an Agent Solicitation message. A
   mobile node receives these Agent Advertisements and determines
   whether it is on its home network or a foreign network.

           |                                   |

      Figure 4. Agent Discovery of Mobile Node at the MPLS Network

   If sent periodically, the nominal interval at which Agent
   Advertisements are sent SHOULD be 1/3 of the advertisement Lifetime
   given in the MPLS shim header. This allows a mobile node to miss
   three successive advertisements before deleting the agent from its
   list of valid agents. The actual transmission time for each
   advertisement SHOULD be slightly randomized [11] in order to avoid
   synchronization and subsequent collisions with other Agent
   Advertisements that may be sent by other agents.


3.5. Location Query of Mobile Node

   This procedure may be OPTIONALLY used for Scenario 2 (Query Before
   Tunneling) to find the direct short-cut path of egress LER or the
   default forwarding path of UDP traffic. When a MN moves to foreign
   mobile IP network, LER3 queries HA for the location of MN. HA
   responses to LER3 whether it has the information of it.

   With Query information from HA, LER initiates the label binding
   process to the egress LER2/FA1 to a MN. After that, LER3 updates the
   row in its label table that uses the CoA of a MN as FEC. It sets a
   label value and outgoing port entries.

   In case that a FN sends IP packets to LER3 without any request
   message, LER3 searches for forwarding label entries to the
   destination MN. If not found, it sends the location query messages to
   HA to get the CoA of a MN. After that, it initiates the Label request
   message to the egress LER2/FA1 destined to a MN.

3.6. LSP Extension for Handover

   There are two phases in handover scheme, we call it LSP Extension and
   LSP Recalculation. When a mobile node moves from Foreign IP Network
   FA1 to FA2, it sends a message to register the new FA. Signaling
   messages should be exchanged between old FA and new FA to extend the
   LSP tunnel. It extends the current LSP by establishing a LSP between
   current FA and new FA. During that time, old FA buffers all the
   packets from and to the mobile node. Once the LSP is established,
   packets are sent along the new path to the mobile node.

   The LSP extension procedures in Figure 8 are as follows.

     - MN moves to a new FA and sends a Registration Request message to
       New FA.
     - New FA sends a Registration Request message to HA.
     - HA sends Registration Reply message in response to the
       Registration Request.
     - If new FA receives Registration Reply message, new FA sends the
       Label Request and LSP Extension Message to old FA.

     - A LSP is established between old FA and new FA when new FA
       receives Label Mapping message.
     - Then the new FA sends Registration Reply message to the MN


3.7. LSP Recalculation

   In LSP Recalculation, LSP tunnels between ingress LER and old FA are
   branched to the new FA. The LSR to perform branching function is
   usually referred to as the crossover LSR.
   After LSP Recalculation, the route between ingress LER and new FA can
   be optimized. Old path is torn down and new path is set up. LSP
   Recalculation is triggered by the MN. It can happen when the QoS of
   LSP tunnel is temporarily degraded.

   The major steps of LSP Recalculation involves:

     1. Determining the location of the crossover switch.
     2. Setting up a new branch LSP.
     3. Terminating the old branch LSP.

            Figure 10. Message Sequence for LSP Recalculation


   The LSP Recalculation procedures in Figure 10 are as follows.

     - LSP Recalculation is triggered by the MN when QoS of channel of
       the mobile node is degraded.
     - New FA sends LSP Recalculation and Label Request message to the
       Crossover LSR when it receives LSP Recalculation message.
     - The Crossover LSR sends Label Mapping message to the new FA and
       releases existing LSP to the new FA via the old FA.
     - Then, FA sends LSP Recalculation message to the MN.

Internet Draft      Draft-choi-mobileip-ldpext-00.txt      December 2000


   Any Messages, TLVs, and procedures not defined explicitly in this
   document are defined in the LDP Specification [3] and IP Mobility
   Support [4]. It can use Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP [2] as
   an informational document related to CR-LDP.


4.1.1. LDP PDUs

   Each LDP PDU is an LDP header followed by one or more LDP messages.
   The LDP header is:

0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

|                               |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Version
   Two octet unsigned integer containing version number

   PDU Length
   Two octet integer specifying the total length of this PDU in octets

   LDP Identifier
   Six octet field that uniquely identifies the label space of the
   sending LSR


4.1.2. Type-Length-Value Encoding

   LDP uses a Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoding scheme to encode much of
   the information carried in LDP messages.

   An LDP TLV is encoded as a 2 octet field that uses 14 bits to specify
   a Type and 2 bits to specify behavior when an LSR doesn't recognize
   the Type, followed by a 2 octet Length Field, followed by a variable
   length Value field.

0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

  Value
  Octet string of Length octets that encodes information to be
  interpreted as specified by the Type field.


4.1.3. Message Format and Protocol Extensibility

   Mobility Support of Constraint-based LDP defines a set of new control
   messages. Currently, the following two message types are defined:

        0x3F01  Registration Request
        0x3F02  Registration Reply
        0x3F03  Location Query
        0x3F04  Location Response
        0x3F05  LSP Extension Request
        0x3F06  LSP Extension Reply
        0x3F07  LSP Recalculation Request
        0x3F08  LSP Recalculation Reply


   This draft defines a general Extension mechanism to allow optional
   information to be carried by LDP messages to support mobility. Each
   of these Extensions is encoded in the TLV format. Extensions allow
   variable amounts of information to be carried within each LDP Message.
   Currently, the following TLV are defined for Extensions appearing in
   LDP Mobility messages:

        0x3F11  Registration Request Data TLV
        0X3F12  Registration Reply Data TLV
        0x3F13  Location Query Data TLV Format
        0x3F14  Location Query Data TLV Format
        0x3F15  LSP Extension Request Date TLV Format
        0x3F16  LSP Extension Reply Data TLV Format
        0x3F17  LSP Recalculation Request Data TLV Format
        0x3F18  LSP Recalculation Reply Data TLV Format

   A mobile node registers with its home agent using a Registration
   Request message of LDP so that its home agent can create or modify a
   mobility binding for that mobile node (e.g., with a new lifetime).
   The Request may be relayed to the home agent by the foreign agent
   through which the mobile node is registering.


4.2.1. Registration Request Message Format

   The encoding for the Registration Request Message is:

4.4. Location Query and Response Messages

   A LER wishing to send a packet to the mobile node for the first time
   must first discover the IP address of the mobile host's HA. The LER
   then issues a query to the HA, which returns the mobile host's
   Location as well as the remaining registration Lifetime. The LER
   cashes the mobile node's Location and uses the cached binding for
   subsequent packets destined to the mobile node. The LER Must refresh
   its binding cache by querying the HA again before the mobile node's
   remaining registration Lifetime expires.
