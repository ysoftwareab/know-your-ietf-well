RFC                   IPv10 Specification            September 13, 2017


1.  Introduction


    IP version 10 (IPv10) is a new version of the Internet Protocol,
    designed to allow IP version 6 [RFC-2460] to communicate to 
    IP version 4 (IPv4) [RFC-791] and vice versa.

- Internet is the global wide network used for communication between
  hosts connected to it.

- These connected hosts (PCs, servers, routers, mobile devices, etc.)
  must have a global unique addresses to be able to communicate
  through the Internet and these unique addresses are defined in the
  Internet Protocol (IP).

- The first version of the Internet Protocol is IPv4.

- When IPv4 was developed in 1975, it was not expected that the number
  of connected hosts to the Internet reach a very huge number of hosts
  more than the IPv4 address space, also it was aimed to be used for
  experimental purposes in the beginning.

- IPv4 is (32-bits) address allowing approximately 4.3 billion unique
  IP addresses.


- A few years ago, with the massive increase of connected hosts to the
  Internet, IPv4 addresses started to run out.

- Three short-term solutions (CIDR, Private addressing, and NAT) were
  introduced in the mid-1990s but even with using these solutions,
  the IPv4 address space ran out in February, 2011 as announced by
  IANA, The announcement of depletion of the IPv4 address space by
  the RIRs is as follows:

  * April, 2011:      APNIC announcement.
  * September, 2012:  RIPE NCC announcement.
  * June, 2014:       LACNIC announcement.
  * September, 2015:  ARIN announcement.
 

- A long term solution (IPv6) was introduced to increase the address
  space used by the Internet Protocol and this was defined in the
  Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

RFC                   IPv10 Specification           September 13, 2017



- IPv6 was developed in 1998 by the Internet Engineering Task Force
  (IETF).

- IPv6 is (128-bits) address and can support a huge number of unique
  IP addresses that is approximately equals to 2^128 unique addresses.

- So, the need for IPv6 became a vital issue to be able to support
  the massive increase of connected hosts to the Internet after the
  IPv4 address space exhaustion.



- The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 became a necessary thing, but
  unfortunately, it would take decades for this full migration to be
  accomplished.

- 19 years have passed since IPv6 was developed, but no full migration
  happened till now and this would cause the Internet to be divided
  into two parts, as IPv4 still dominating on the Internet traffic
  (85% as measured by Google in April, 2017) and new Internet hosts
  will be assigned IPv6-only addresses and be able to communicate with
  15% only of the Internet services and apps. 

- So, the need for solutions for the IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence became
  an important issue in the migration process as we cannot wake up in
  the morning and find all IPv4 hosts are migrated to be IPv6 hosts,
  especially, as most enterprises have not do this migration for
  creating a full IPv6 implementation.

- Also, the request for using IPv6 addresses in addition to the
  existing IPv4 addresses (IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stacks) in all enterprise
  networks have not achieve a large implementation that can make IPv6
  the most dominated IP in the Internet as many people believe that
  they will not have benefits from just having a larger IP address
  bits and IPv4 satisfies their needs, also, not all enterprises
  devices support IPv6 and also many people are afraid of the service
  outage that can be caused due to this migration.  



- The recent solutions for IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence are:

   Native dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6)
   Tunneling
   NAT64
   Dual-stack Lite
   464xlat
   MAP
  (other technologies also exist, like lw6over4; they may have more
  specific use cases)



- IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack, allows both IPv4 and IPv6 to coexist by
  using both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for all hosts at the same time,
  but this solution does not allows IPv4 hosts to communicate to
  IPv6 hosts and vice versa. Also, after the depletion of the IPv4
  address space, new Internet hosts will not be able to use IPv4/IPv6
  Dual Stacks.

- Tunneling, allows IPv6 hosts to communicate to each other through
  an IPv4 network, but still does not allows IPv4 hosts to communicate
  to IPv6 hosts and vice versa.

- NAT-PT, allows IPv6 hosts to communicate to IPv4 hosts with only
  using hostnames and getting DNS involved in the communication process
  but this solution was inefficient because it does not allows
  communication using direct IP addresses, also the need for so much
  protocol translations of the source and destination IP addresses
  made the solution complex and not applicable thats why it was moved
  to the Historic status in the RFC 2766. Also, NAT64 requires so much
  protocol translations and statically configured bindings, and also
  getting a DNS64 involved in the communication process.

2.  Internet Protocol version 10 (IPv10).



- IPv10 is the solution presented in this Internet draft.

- It solves the issue of allowing IPv6 only hosts to communicate to
  IPv4 only hosts and vice versa in a simple and very efficient way,
  especially when the communication is done using both direct IP
  addresses and when using hostnames between IPv10 hosts, as there
  is no need for protocol translations or getting the DNS involved
  in the communication process more than its normal address
  resolution function.

- IPv10 allows hosts from two IP versions (IPv4 and IPv6) to be able
  to communicate, and this can be accomplished by having an IPv10
  packet containing a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same
  IP packet header.

- From here the name of IPv10 arises, as the IP packet can contain
  (IPv6 + IPv4 /IPv4 + IPv6) addresses in the same layer 3 packet
  header.

3.  The Four Types of Communication.


     3.1) IPv10: IPv6 Host to IPv4 Host.
         ------------------------------


- IPv10 Packet:


         |          128-bit        |                    128-bit                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Data|   Source IPv6 Address   | 0000..0  ASN  MAC  Destination IPv4 Address |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   ASN ==> Autonomous System Number.
   MAC ==> Media Access Control.

   - The destination address is 128 bit, when the 1st 32-bits are zeros, the router
     will know that the last 32-bit is an IPv4 address and it can start forwarding
     the packet based on that address.

   - The second 16-bit represents the Autonomous System Number (ASN) where the sending
     host is located, this should be learned by the router (in the RA reply message
     which is not yet implemented) and this will be used for routing purposes in the
     future.

   - The third 48-bit represents the sending host MAC address and this can be used for
     host identification.
   
   - The last 32-bit represents the destination IPv4 address. 



- Sending IPv10 host TCP/IP Configuration:   	


      IP Address:               IPv6 Address
      Prefix Length:            /length
      Default Gateway:	        IPv6 Address (Optional)
      DNS Addresses:	        IPv6/IPv4 Address

                     IPv10: IPv4 host to IPv4 host


Important Notes: - IPv4 and IPv6 routing must be enabled on all routers, so
                   when a router receives an IPv10 packet, it should use
                   the appropriate routing table based on the destination
                   address within the IPv10 packet.
 
                 - That means, if the received IPv10 packet contains an IPv4
                   address in the destination address field, the router
                   should use the IPv4 routing table to make a routing
                   decision, and if the received IPv10 packet contains an IPv6 
                   address in the destination address field, the router should 
                   use the IPv6 routing table to make a routing decision.
  
                 - All Internet connected hosts must be IPv10 hosts to be
                   able to communicate regardless the used IP version,
                   and the IPv10 deployment process can be accomplished
                   by ALL technology companies developing OSs for hosts
                   networking and security devices.



   When the source or destination is an IPv4 address, the IPv4 address is located in
   the last 32 bits.

   When the source is IPv4 and the destination is IPv6, the sending host will consider
   the destination IPv6 address as an IPv4 address not on the same subnet, meaning it
   should send this frame to the default gateway (router).

   Once the router receives the frame, it removes the frame header and trailer and look
   for the destination IPv6 address, then the router start to take a routing decision by
   checking its IPv6 routing table and start sending the packet to the next hop through
   the IPv6 network.


   Similarly, when the source is IPv6 and the destination is IPv4, the sending host will
   consider the destination IPv4 address as an IPv6 address not on the same subnet, meaning
   it should send this frame to the default gateway (router)

   Once the router receives the frame, it removes the frame header and trailer and look for
   the destination IPv4 address, then the router start to take a routing decision by checking
   its IPv4 routing table and start sending the packet to the next hop through the IPv4 network.

5. Advantages of IPv10.


    1) Introduces an efficient way of communication between IPv6 hosts
       and IPv4 hosts.

    2) Allows IPv4 only hosts to exist and communicate with IPv6 only
       hosts even after the depletion of the IPv4 address space.
 
    3) Adds flexibility when making a query sent to the DNS for
       hostname resolution as IPv4 and IPv6 hosts can communicate with
       IPv4 or IPv6 DNS servers and the DNS can reply with any record
       it has (either an IPv6 record Host AAAA record or an IPv4
       record Host A record).

    4) There is no need to think about migration as both IPv4 and IPv6
       hosts can coexist and communicate to each other which will
       allow the usage of the address space of both IPv4 and IPv6
       making the available number of connected hosts be bigger.

    5) IPv10 support on "all" Internet connected hosts can be deployed
       in a very short time by technology companies developing OSs
       (for hosts and networking devices, and there will be no
       dependence on enterprise users and it is just a software
       development process in the NIC cards of all hosts to allow
       encapsulating both IPv4 and IPv6 in the same IP packet header.  

    6) Offers the four types of communication between hosts:

          - IPv6 hosts to IPv4 hosts (6 to 4).
         
          - IPv4 hosts to IPv6 hosts (4 to 6).
   
          - IPv6 hosts to IPv6 hosts (6 to 6).
   
          - IPv4 hosts to IPv4 hosts (4 to 4).

IANA Considerations

   IANA must reserve version number 10 for the 4-bit Version Field
   in the Layer 3 packet header for the IPv10 packet.
