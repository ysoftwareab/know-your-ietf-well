   Abstract 
    
   A critical factor in achieving good performance for IP mobility 
   protocols is the design of L2 handover. Handover occurs when a 
   Mobile Node moves from one radio Access Point to another. If the new 
   radio Access Point is associated with a new subnet, a change in 
   routing reachability may occur and require L3 protocol action on the 
   part of the Mobile Node or Access Routers. If no change in subnet 
   occurs, the Access Point may still need to take some action to 
   inform the Access Router about a change in on-link reachability. In 
   either case, prompt and timely information from L2 to the parties 
   involved about the sequencing of handover can help optimize handover 
   at the IP level. This draft discusses requirements for an L2 
   handover protocol or API to support optimized handover.

1.0  Introduction 
    
   An important consideration in the design of IP mobility protocols is 
   handover. A moving Mobile Node (MN) may irregularly need to change 
   the terrestrial radio Access Point (AP) with which it is 
   communicating. The change in L2 connectivity to a new AP may cause a 
   change in IP routing reachability, and thus require either the MN or 
   the Access Routers (ARs) to perform actions that update routing 
   information for the MN. Even if no change in subnet occurs, the APs 
   may still need to communicate the change in on-link reachability to 
   the local AR. In order for handover to occur, candidate APs must be 
   identified and a target AP must be selected [9]. Once this process 
   has been complete, the handover process can begin. 
    
   Several protocol designs have been advanced for Mobile IP that seek 
   to reduce the amount of handover latency at L3 [3] [4]. These 
   protocols depend on obtaining timely information from the L2 
   protocol about the progress of handover. An additional beneficiary 
   of timely handover progress information is context transfer [5]. 
   Context transfer involves moving context information (QoS, header 
   compression, authentication, etc.) from the old AR to the new. By 
   moving such context information, the ARs can avoid requiring the MN 
   to set up all the context information from scratch, considerably 
   reducing the amount of time necessary to set up basic network 
   service on the new subnet. If handover progress information is 
   available from L2, context transfer can proceed more quickly. 
    
   This document discusses requirements on underlying systems for 
   supporting optimized IP mobility, in particular, handover. While the 
   document has been written with existing Mobile IP work in mind, it 
   should be applicable to any protocol that can benefit from knowledge

   about handover sequencing to facilitate mobility. Requirements for 
   assisting in handover between two APs on the same subnet, between 
   two ARs on different subnets, and for context transfer between ARs 
   are discussed. 
    
2.0  Terminology 
    
   The following terms are used in this document. 
    
      Access Point (AP) 
    
         A Layer 2 (L2) access entity, e.g. a radio transceiver 
         station, that is connected to one or more Access Routers. Its 
         primary function is to provide MNs an L2 wireless link via its 
         specific air-interface technology.     
    
      Access Router (AR) 
        
         A Layer 3 (L3) IP router, residing in an access network and 
         connected to one or more Access Points. An AR is the first hop 
         router for a MN. 
    
      L2 Handover 
    
         Change of MN's link layer connection from one AP to another. 
         No change in off-subnet routing reachability information is 
         required if both APs are part of the same subnet. 
    
      L3 Handover 
       
         Change of MN's routable address from one AR to another. An L3 
         handover results in a change in the MN's routing reachability, 
         that will require action on the part of the IP mobility 
         protocol running in the MN and/or ARs. 
    
3.0  L2 Trigger Definition 
    
   This section discusses defining L2 triggers that provide information 
   on the sequencing of handover. An L2 trigger is not associated with 
   any specific L2 but rather is based on the kind of L2 information 
   that is or could be available from a wide variety of radio link 
   protocols.  
    
3.1. What is an L2 Trigger? 
    
   An L2 trigger is an abstraction of a notification from L2 
   (potentially including parameter information) that a certain event 
   has happened or is about to happen. The trigger may be implemented 
   in a variety of ways. Some examples are: 
    
    
   Yegin (editor), et. al.  Informational - Expires December 2002 
   [Page 4]         Optimized IP Mobility Support           June 2002 
                                    
      - The L2 driver may allow the IP stack to register a callback 
        function that is called when the trigger fires. The parameters 
        associated with the trigger are delivered to the callback. 
    
      - The operating system may allow a thread to call into a system 
        call for the appropriate trigger or triggers. The system call 
        blocks until a particular trigger has fired, then it returns 
        with parameter information available in some way (return value 
        of the system call, file descriptor, etc.). 
    
      - The trigger may consist of a protocol for transferring the 
        trigger notification and parameter information at either L2 or 
        L3 between the new AP or AR and the old AP or AR. The parameter 
        information is included as part of the protocol. This allows 
        the IP stack on a separate machine to react to the trigger. The 
        IAPP protocol [6] is an example of such a protocol. 
       
      - The trigger information may be available within the operating 
        system kernel to the IP stack from the driver as an out of band 
        communication. 
 
   In any case, the implementation details of how the information 
   involved in an L2 trigger are transferred to the IP mobility 
   protocol are likely to color how the mobility protocol is 
   implemented on top of that L2, but they should not influence the 
   specification of the abstract L2 triggers themselves. 
    
3.2. Information in an L2 Trigger 
    
   There are three types of information involved in defining an L2 
   trigger: 
    
      1. The event that causes the L2 trigger to fire, 
    
      2. The IP entity that receives the trigger, 
 
      3. The parameters delivered with the trigger. 
 
   The IP entities that can receive the trigger depend on the 
   particular IP mobility protocol in use. Here are some possible IP 
   entities, based on work done with L2 triggers and Mobile IP: 
    
      MN        The MN may receive an L2 trigger allowing it to start  
                or conclude a mobile controlled handover.  
       
      FA        In Mobile IPv4, the Foreign Agent (FA) is located on 
                the last hop before the wireless link. The last hop 
                can be either an AP or AR or even a separate host. 
                An FA can make use of triggers to start or conclude 
                network controlled handover. 
       
      AR        The AR can obtain an L2 trigger directly from the  
     
   Yegin (editor), et. al.  Informational - Expires December 2002  
   [Page 5]         Optimized IP Mobility Support           June 2002 
                                    
                wireless link if one of its interfaces is on the 
                link (that is, the AR is also an AP), or it can obtain 
                an L2 trigger indirectly by L2 or L3 protocol messages
                from the AP. 
 
4.0  Requirements for L2 Triggers 
    
   L2 handover, L3 handover, and context transfer events and related 
   protocols would benefit from a collection of L2 triggers. Some of 
   these protocols directly rely on the existence of certain triggers, 
   and perform better when others are available. As such, L2 triggers 
   should be designed to meet these protocols∆ needs.  
 
4.1. L2 Handovers 
    
   On the face of it, specifying requirements for pure L2 handover 
   (i.e. no change in IP routing reachability) might seem out of scope 
   for IETF. Existing wireless networks typically have special L2 AP-AR 
   interfaces with L2 address update built in. For these systems, L2 
   triggers are unnecessary. 
    
   However, current trends in wireless networking suggest that future 
   wireless networks will consist of a variety of heterogeneous 
   wireless APs bridged into the wired network, potentially on the same 
   subnet. A change in wireless AP, either between an AP supporting one 
   wireless link technology and an AP supporting another, or between 
   two APs supporting the same wireless technology, necessarily results 
   in a change in the on-subnet reachability. Packet delivery within 
   the subnet can be optimized if this information can be propagated to 
   the AR, so it can update its on-subnet L2 address to IP address 
   mapping.  
    
   In addition, the old AP may benefit from a notification that the MN 
   has moved in the event it is not involved in the handover (as is the 
   case with some WLAN radio protocols), by allowing the old AP to more 
   quickly de-allocate resources dedicated to the moved MN. Some radio  
   link protocols already define IP-based L2 trigger protocols for this  
   purpose [6]. When APs supporting multiple radio technologies on a  
   single subnet are involved, however, interoperability suffers if  
   there is no L2-independent way of reporting on-link movement.  
 
4.2. L3 Handovers 
    
   Low latency handover protocol designs for Mobile IPv4 and Mobile 
   IPv6 [3] [4] rely on the existence of certain L2 triggers. 
   Either the MN or the AP/AR needs to receive an indication that the 
   handoff is imminent for these L3 mobility protocols to work. This 
   trigger must be received by the MN for mobile-controlled handovers, 
   and received by the AP/AR for network-controlled handovers. Timely 
   receipt of this trigger is needed as protocol signaling needs to 
   take place in parallel with the handoff. Protocol signaling over the 
   current link should be completed prior to loss of connectivity. 
     
   Yegin (editor), et. al.  Informational - Expires December 2002  
   [Page 6]         Optimized IP Mobility Support           June 2002 
                                    
    
   Additional triggers that indicate the link tear down and 
   establishment can be used to indicate departure and arrival of a MN 
   at AP/ARs. Such indications can replace L3 signal exchange and 
   therefore expedite the process. An L2 that supports a collection of 
   such triggers is a good candidate for a high performance Mobile IP 
   implementation.  
    
4.3. Context Transfers 
 
   Context transfer (CT) is a relatively new issue for supporting 
   seamless mobility between two ARs or FAs that provide access to a 
   mobile node. Although lacking a "de facto" CT protocol specification 
   at this time, plausible approaches toward a CT framework are well 
   described in [7] [8]. Conceptually, CT can take place before, 
   during, or after handover. Exactly when and how CT takes place is 
   highly dependent on the type of context being transferred. 
    
   L2 triggers are used to initiate the context transfer operation. 
   Early notification of handovers is essential to having sufficient 
   time to complete the required protocol signaling. Also link 
   establishment trigger can be used for activating the state related 
   to a context. 
 
5.0  L2 Triggers 
    
   Based on the L2 handover, L3 handover, and context transfer 
   protocols∆ needs, underlying systems are required to implement basic 
   L2 triggers as outlined in Table 1.  
 
   The description for a trigger contains the trigger name, the L2 
   handover event causing the trigger to fire, what entities receive 
   the trigger, and parameters, if any. The recipient is qualified by 
   the IP mobility protocol in which the recipient plays a role. If the 
   recipient does not have AP functionality (i.e., the recipient does 
   not have an interface directly on the wireless link), the trigger 
   information must be conveyed from the AP where it occurs to the 
   recipient by an L2 or L3 protocol [10].

6.0  Benefits of L2 Triggers for Other Systems 
    
   While the primary purpose of L2 triggers described in this draft is 
   to aid L2 mobility optimization, L2 triggers can also benefit 
   networks without Mobile IP or other IP mobility protocol support. 
    
   Yegin (editor), et. al.  Informational - Expires December 2002 
   [Page 8]         Optimized IP Mobility Support           June 2002 
                                    
   For example, IP addresses may change due to stateless or stateful
   address configuration whenever hosts are unplugged from the network 
   or re-plugged into a different subnet.  
    
   Use of L2 triggers in such situations enables efficient state 
   management in the AR. The AR can clean up the associated state as 
   soon as it detects that a host has been disconnected through the L2 
   Link Down trigger, for example. State clean up includes removal of 
   ARP or Neighbor Cache entries, and can save bandwidth by inhibiting 
   incoming data on the link where the host was once connected. 
    
   Additionally, faster and more efficient router discovery is possible 
   if the AR receives a L2 Link Up trigger for a host. When the AR 
   receives the trigger, it can send an unsolicited unicast router
   advertisement to the host. The host can begin the process of 
   establishing IP connectivity more quickly. 

7.0  Example: 802.11

   In this section, we give an example of how a subset of the L2 
   triggers could be implemented for the 802.11 wireless LAN protocol 
   [11] and used by Mobile IPv6 [2].

   The 802.11 protocol supports a MAC layer management frame called 
   Reassociation.request. The Reassociation.request frame is sent by a
   MN to a peer acting as an AP when the MN is in infrastructure mode 
   and the MN wishes to change its association from its current AP to a 
   new AP. The MN determines that a new AP is available because it 
   detects a beacon from the new AP. The MN sends the 
   Reassociation.request because the bit error rate on the link with 
   the old AP has become too high (the standard does not specify 
   exactly how high is too high, however).

   The 802.11 Reassociation.request message contains the MAC address of 
   the MN's current AP, and it is sent to the MAC address of the MN's 
   desired new AP. The MAC layer frame in addition contains the MN's 
   MAC address. Upon receipt of the Reassociation.request, the AP 
   determines if the MN may reassociate and replies with a 
   Reassociation.reply message either allowing or denying the request.

   The Reassociation.request and Reassociation.reply contain the 
   material for the following L2 triggers:

   - When the MN's 802.11 driver receives a Reassociation.reply from 
     the new AP confirming reassociation, it can deliver a Link Up
     trigger to the Mobile IP stack (or a daemon that communicates
     with the Mobile IP stack and is monitoring the driver) containing 
     the MAC address of the new AP.

   - When the AP determines that it can send a positive 
     Reassociation.reply to the MN, it can generate a Link Up trigger 
     with the MN's MAC address and the MAC address of the MN's old AP.

   On the MN, the Link Up trigger delivered to the Mobile IP stack 
   triggers the stack to send a Solicitation for Router Advertisement 
   [2] to the new AR. This causes the AR to reply with a Router 
   Advertisement. The MN compares the subnet prefix advertised by 
   the router with its current subnet prefix, and if it determines that 
   it has moved into a new subnet, it begins the process of 
   establishing a new Care of Address. In this case, the MN is running 
   standard Mobile IP without any fast handover enhancements; but 
   because of the L2 trigger, it is able to eliminate the latency 
   involved in waiting for a Router Advertisement beacon from the AR, 
   thus increasing handover performance.

   On the AP, the disposition of the Link Up trigger depends on the 
   relationship between the AP and the AR. If the AP is acting as a 
   transparent Layer 2 bridge, then some type of protocol is needed to 
   transfer the trigger from the AP to the AR. This could be an 
   addition to the 802 protocol, or it could be an enhancement to IAPP, 
   the 802.11 InterAccess Point Protocol [6], or it could be an IPv6 
   protocol enhancement [10]. Upon receipt of the trigger protocol, the 
   AR's driver or Mobile IP stack disposes of it exactly as in the case 
   of a trigger on the MN. If the AP is integrated with the AR, then 
   the trigger is delivered programmatically to the Mobile IP stack.

8.0  Security Considerations 
    
   The L2 triggers convey information about the link state of the MN 
   and this information can trigger IP layer changes in routing 
   reachability. As such, the information in an L2 trigger, if misused 
   by an adversary or fraudulently propagated, could result in denial 
   of IP service to the MN or hijacking of the MN's packets to a 
   hostile third party.  
    
   If the L2 trigger is implemented as an API on an AR or AP, then the 
   operating system and API implementation are required to assure that 
   only qualified users can call into the API. Normally this involves 
   denying access through the API unless the process running the API 
   client has the proper security credentials on the host. If the L2 
   trigger is implemented as an L2 or L3 protocol, the protocol is 
   required to protect the trigger messages with the proper 
   authentication. In particular, if the protocol is an IP-based 
   protocol, it must include authenticators so the parties that use the 
   protocol can authenticate each other. If the protocol is intended to 
   be used on public data networks, the option of encrypting the 
   traffic must be available, to grant some privacy over the MN 
   movement information propagated by the protocol messages.
