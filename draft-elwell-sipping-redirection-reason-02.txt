         SIP Reason header extension for redirection reasons June 2005 
 
 
    
1 Introduction 
    
   Central to SIP [2] is the concept of redirecting or retargeting a 
   request by a proxy, whereby the Request-URI in the original request 
   is replaced before forwarding the request on the next hop. Sometimes 
   this is due to normal rerouting behaviour of the proxy (e.g., 
   resolving an address-of-record URI to a contact URI). At other times 
   it is due to more application-related reasons, e.g., where a user has 
   made arrangements for calls to that user under certain conditions to 
   be forwarded to a different destination. 
    
   The History-Info header [3] provides a means for conveying 
   information about a retarget to the final destination UAS and also 
   back to the UAC. In addition to providing the retargeted-from and 
   retargeted-to URIs for each recorded retarget, this header also 
   conveys a reason by means of the Reason header. The Reason header 
   accompanies the retargeted-from URI and reflects the reason why 
   attempts to reach that target failed, normally in the form of the SIP 
   response code concerned. 
    
   However, the repertoire of reasons available for use in the Reason 
   header is sometimes insufficient to reflect application-related 
   reasons for retargeting. In particular it cannot reflect accurately 
   the range of reasons used in PSTN/ISDN for call "diversion". This 
   makes it difficult to provide interworking with PSTN/IDSN for calls 
   that undergo retargeting / diversion and also makes it difficult for 
   SIP-based networks to offer a behaviour similar to that of diversion 
   in PSTN/ISTN. 
    
2 Requirements 
    
   REQ-1. Provide a means for a gateway to provide information in a SIP 
   INVITE request to reflect PSTN diversion reasons when mapping a 
   diverted PSTN call request to a SIP INVITE request. 
    
   REQ-2. Provide a means for a gateway to provide information in a 
   response to a SIP INVITE request to reflect PSTN diversion reasons 
   when mapping a response to a PSTN call establishment request to a 
   response to a SIP INVITE request. 
    
   REQ-3. Provide a means for a gateway to provide information in a 3xx 
   response to a SIP INVITE request to reflect PSTN diversion reasons 
   when mapping a PSTN call diversion request to a 3xx response to a SIP 
   INVITE request. 
    
   REQ-4. Provide a means for a gateway to obtain information from a SIP 
   retargeted or recursed SIP INVITE request for deriving PSTN diversion

   reasons when mapping the SIP INVITE request to a PSTN call 
   establishment request. 
    
   REQ-5. Provide a means for a gateway to obtain information from a 
   response to a retargeted or recursed SIP INVITE request for deriving 
   PSTN diversion reasons when mapping the SIP response to a response to 
   a PSTN call establishment request. 
    
   REQ-6. Provide a means for a gateway to obtain information from a 3xx 
   response to a SIP INVITE request for deriving PSTN diversion reasons 
   when mapping the SIP 3xx response to a PSTN call diversion request. 
    
3 Overview of proposed solution 
    
   The proposed solution is to enhance the Reason header with new values 
   that reflect diversion reasons in PSTN/ISDN. This can be done by 
   defining a new "protocol" value and then defining specific new reason 
   values under the umbrella of the new "protocol" value. The enhanced 
   Reason header can then be used as a parameter of a History-Info 
   header field entry. This allows the forwarding of PSTN diversion 
   reasons when mapping an INVITE request or response containing a 
   History-Info header field to/from PSTN signalling. 
    
   In addition the enhanced Reason header can be used in a 3xx response 
   to an INVITE request. This fulfils two functions. First, it allows 
   the forwarding of PSTN diversion reasons when mapping a 3xx response 
   to an INVITE request to/from PSTN signalling. Secondly it provides 
   information to a proxy or UAC for inclusion in the History-Info 
   header field when the request undergoes recursion. 
    
   Candidate reasons include forward unavailable, forward busy, forward 
   no reply, forward unconditional, deflection immediate, deflection 
   alerting, hunting, mobile not reachable. 
    
   Note that selection of the new target may depend on several other 
   conditions (e.g., relating to date, time, the source of the request 
   or caller preferences), but the reasons suggested above should be 
   sufficient to convey the main circumstance leading to the retarget. 
    
4 Extension to the Reason header 
    
   This document defines the following new protocol value for the 
   protocol field of the Reason header field in [1]: 
    
     Redirection: The cause parameter contains a reason for redirection 
     of a request. 
    
   This document defines the following redirection cause codes:

     Value  Default Text           Description 
      
     1      Normal redirection     The call has been retargeted for 
                                   normal routing reasons 
      
     2      Forward unavailable    The call has been retargeted 
                                   because the called user is 
                                   unavailable (no registered contact). 
      
     3      Forward busy           The call has been retargeted 
                                   because the called user is busy. 
      
     4      Forward no reply       The call has been retargeted 
                                   because the called user has been 
                                   alerted but has failed to reply. 
      
     5      Forward unconditional  The call has been retargeted 
                                   immediately without determining 
                                   whether the called user is 
                                   unavailable or busy and without 
                                   alerting the user. 
      
     6      Deflection immediate   The call has been retargeted as a 
                                   result of a request by the called 
                                   user's device without alerting the 
                                   called user. 
      
     7      Deflection alerting    The call has been retargeted as a 
                                   result of action by the called user 
                                   in response to alerting. 
      
     8      Hunting                The call has been retargeted to an 
                                   individual member of the hunt group 
                                   at which it was previously targeted. 
      
     9      Mobile not reachable   The call has been retargeted 
                                   because the called mobile user is 
                                   not reachable 
      
   Example syntax is as follows: 
    
     Reason: redirection;cause=3 ;text="Forward busy" 
    
5 Inclusion of the Reason header in 3xx responses 
    
   [1] states that the Reason header field is not usually needed in 
   responses because the status code and the reason phrase already 
   provide sufficient information. However, this is not so in the case 
   of a 3xx response, since there may be a need to provide a diversion

   reason in the 3xx response for inclusion in the History-Info header 
   field in the event of recursion or for mapping directly to/from PSTN. 
   Therefore in order to satisfy this need, a 3xx response MAY contain a 
   Reason header field. 
    
     NOTE. [1] states that the Reason header can appear in any response 
     whose status code explicitly allows the presence of this field. The 
     statement above performs this function. 
    
6 Examples 
    
6.1 Retargeting with reason "Forward Unconditional" to PSTN

             |    200 OK F7   |              |                   | 
             |<---------------|              |                   |

             |                |--------------------------------->| 
    
   Assuming the entity sending the INVITE supports the History-Info 
   header, the INVITE would look like this: 
    
   F1 (INVITE) Alice -> Proxy 
      
     INVITE  sip:Bob@example.com; SIP/2.0 
     From: <sip:Alice@example.com>;tag=2 
     To: <sip:Bob@example.com > 
     Call-ID: 12345600@example.com 
     CSeq: 1 INVITE 
     History-Info: <sip:Bob@example.com>;index=1 
     ...

         SIP Reason header extension for redirection reasons June 2005 
 
 
   The call is then retargeted to a contact URI 
   <sip:12345@gateway.example.com>. The forwarded INVITE request would 
   be as follows: 
    
   F3 (INVITE) û Proxy -> Gateway 
      
     INVITE  sip:12345@gateway.example.com SIP/2.0 
     From: <sip:Alice@example.com>;tag=2 
     To: <sip:Bob@example.com> 
     Call-ID: 12345600@example.com 
     CSeq: 1 INVITE 
     History-Info: <sip:Bob@example.com? Reason=Redirection%3B 
     cause%3D5%3Btext%3D%22Forward%20unconditional%22>;index=1, 
     <sip:12345@gateway.example.com>;index=2 
    
     Note that in accordance with [2] the following escape characters 
     are used within parameters of URL headers: %3B for semicolon, %3D 
     for equals, %22 for double quote and %20 for space. 
    
   The "index 1" entry indicates that the call to Bob was retargeted 
   because of redirection reason forward unconditional. 
    
   The "index 2" entry indicates that the call to 12345 has not yet been 
   further retargeted. 
    
   The Reason header field provides a diversion reason that can be 
   included in relevant PSTN messaging. 
    
6.2 Retargeting with reason "Forward Busy" 
    
           Alice            Proxy           Bob              Gateway

   Assuming the entity sending the INVITE supports the History-Info 
   header, the INVITE would look like this: 
    
   F1 (INVITE) Alice -> Proxy 
      
     INVITE  sip:Bob@example.com; SIP/2.0 
     From: <sip:Alice@example.com>;tag=2 
     To: <sip:Bob@example.com > 
     Call-ID: 12345600@example.com 
     CSeq: 1 INVITE 
     History-Info: <sip:Bob@example.com>;index=1 
     ... 
    
   Bob indicates a Busy so that a 486 response is send back. 
    
   F4 (486 Busy Here) Bob -> Proxy 
      
     SIP/2.0 486 Busy Here 
     From: <sip:Alice @example.com>;tag=2

     Call-ID: 12345600@example.com 
     CSeq: 1 INVITE 
      
      
     à 
   On receipt of F4 (486 Busy Here) and because of forwarding on busy 
   provisioned at the proxy on behalf of Bob, the call is then 
   retargeted to a URI <sip:12345@gateway.example.com>. This URI is pre-
   provisioned within the Proxy. The forwarded INVITE request would be 
   as follows:

   Because of forwarding on busy at Bob, the call is then redirected to 
   a contact URI <sip:12345@gateway.example.com> in a 302 response. The 
   response would be as follows: 
    
   F4 (302 Moved Temporarily) Bob -> Proxy

   The call then undergoes recursion to the contact URI 
   <sip:12345@gateway.example.com>. The forwarded INVITE request would

   The "index 1" entry indicates that the call to Bob was retargeted 
   (recursed). 
    
   The "index 2" entry indicates that the call to 12345 has not yet been 
   further retargeted. 
    
   The Reason header field for index 1 provides a diversion reason that 
   can be included in relevant PSTN messaging.

   Assuming the entity sending the INVITE supports the History-Info 
   header, the INVITE would look like this: 
    
   F1 (INVITE) Alice -> Proxy 
      
     INVITE  sip:12345@gateway.example.com; SIP/2.0

     CSeq: 1 INVITE 
     History-Info: <sip:12345@gateway.example.com>;index=1 
     ... 
    
   Because of forwarding on busy in the PSTN to a number that the 
   gateway is able to resolve to Bob, the call is then redirected to a 
   contact URI <sip:Bob@example.com> in a 302 response. The response 
   would be as follows: 
    
   F4 (302 Moved Temporarily) Gateway -> Proxy 
      
     SIP/2.0 302 Moved temporarily 
     From: <sip:Alice @example.com>;tag=2

   The Reason header field is derived from PSTN messaging.

   The call then undergoes recursion to the contact URI 
   <sip:Bob@example.com>. The forwarded INVITE request would be as

     cause%3D3%3Btext%3D%22Forward%20busy%22>;index=1, 
     <sip:Bob@example.com>;index=2 
    
   The "index 1" entry indicates that the call to the PSTN was 
   retargeted (recursed) with reason Forward busy, the Reason header 
   field having been copied from the 302 response. 
    
   The "index 2" entry indicates that the call to Bob has not yet been 
   further retargeted. 
    
7 IANA considerations 
    
   This document defines one new value for the SIP Reason header [1] 
   protocol namespace. The new value is "Redirection" and indicates the 
   use of cause value defined in this document. 
    
   This document also creates an IANA registry for cause values that 
   populate the cause field of the Reason header when protocol value 
   "Redirection" is used and corresponding default values that populate 
   the text field. The current cause and text values in this new 
   registry are as follows: 
    
     Cause value  Default text value    Reference 
     -----------  ------------------------------ 
     1            Normal redirection    This document 
     2            Forward unavailable   This document 
     3            Forward busy          This document 
     4            Forward no reply      This document 
     5            Forward unconditional This document 
     6            Deflection immediate  This document 
     7            Deflection alerting   This document 
     8            Hunting               This document 
     9            Mobile not reachable  This document 
    
   New values for this registry can only be defined by means of a 
   published standard.

8 Security Considerations 
    
   The security considerations of [1] apply. When the Reason header 
   field is embedded within a History-Info header field, the security 
   considerations of [3] apply. 
    
   Unauthorised insertion, deletion of modification of the Reason header 
   field can provide misleading information to users and applications. 
   Eavesdropping on this header field can reveal information about a 
   user. Securing of SIP connections by TLS can combat this problem. 
    
   A SIP entity that can provide a redirection reason in a Reason header 
   field SHOULD be able to suppress this in accordance with privacy 
   requirements of the user concerned.
