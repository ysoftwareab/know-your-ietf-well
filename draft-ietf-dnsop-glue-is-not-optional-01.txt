             Glue In DNS Referral Responses Is Not Optional
                draft-ietf-dnsop-glue-is-not-optional-01

Abstract

   The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the
   addresses of nameservers that are contained within a delegated zone.
   Servers are expected to return available glue records in referrals.
   If message size constraints prevent the inclusion of glue records in
   a UDP response, the server MUST set the TC flag to inform the client
   that the response is incomplete, and that the client SHOULD use TCP
   to retrieve the full response.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034], [RFC1035] uses glue records
   to allow iterative clients to find the addresses of nameservers that
   are contained within a delegated zone.  Glue records are added to the
   parent zone as part of the delegation process.  Servers are expected
   to return available glue records in referrals.  If message size
   constraints prevent the inclusion of glue records in a UDP response,
   the server MUST set the TC flag to inform the client that the
   response is incomplete, and that the client SHOULD use TCP to
   retrieve the full response.  This document clarifies that
   expectation.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Clarifying modifications to RFC1034

   Replace

   "Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the authority section of the
   reply.  Put whatever addresses are available into the additional
   section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not available from
   authoritative data or the cache.  Go to step 4."

   with

   "Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the authority section of the
   reply.  Put whatever addresses are available into the additional
   section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not available from
   authoritative data or the cache.  If glue RRs do not fit, set TC=1 in
   the header.  Go to step 4."

3.  Why glue is required

   While not common, real life examples of servers that fail to set TC=1
   when glue records are available exist and they do cause resolution
   failures.

3.1.  Example one: Missing glue

   The example below from June 2020 shows a case where none of the glue
   records, present in the zone, fitted into the available space and
   TC=1 was not set in the response.  While this example shows an DNSSEC
   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035] referral response, this behaviour has
   also been seen with plain DNS responses as well.  The records have
   been truncated for display purposes.  Note that at the time of this
   writing, this configuration has been corrected and the response
   correctly sets the TC=1 flag.

   DNS responses sometimes contain optional data in the additional
   section.  Glue records however are not optional.  Several other
   protocol extensions, when used, are also not optional.  This includes
   TSIG [RFC2845], OPT [RFC6891], and SIG(0) [RFC2931].

3.2.  Example two: Sibling Glue from the same delegating zone

   Sibling glue are glue records that are not contained in the
   delegating zone itself, but in another delegated zone.  In many
   cases, these are not strictly required for resolution, since the
   resolver can make follow-on queries to the same zone to resolve the
   nameserver addresses after following the referral to the sibling
   zone.  However, most nameserver implementations provide them as an
   optimization to obviate the need for extra traffic.

Internet-Draft  Glue In DNS Referral Responses Is Not Op       July 2021


 Here the delegating zone "test" contains 2 delegations for the
 subzones "bar.test" and "foo.test". The nameservers for "foo.test"
 consist of sibling glue for "bar.test" (ns1.bar.test and ns2.bar.test).

       bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.bar.test.
       bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.bar.test.
       ns1.bar.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.1.1
       ns2.bar.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.1.2

       foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.bar.test.
       foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.bar.test.

 Referral responses from test for foo.test should include the sibling
 glue:

    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;www.foo.test.       IN      A

    ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
    foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns1.bar.test.
    foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns2.bar.test.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    ns1.bar.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.1.1
    ns2.bar.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.1.2

   Question: if sibling glue from the same delegating zone does not fit
   into the response, should we also recommend or require that TC=1 be
   set?

3.3.  Example three: Cross Zone Sibling Glue

   Here is a more complex example of sibling glue that lives in another
   zone, but is required to resolve a circular dependency in the zone
   configuration.

      example.com.               86400   IN NS      ns1.example.net.
      example.com.               86400   IN NS      ns2.example.net.
      ns1.example.com.           86400   IN A       192.0.1.1
      ns2.example.com.           86400   IN A       192.0.1.2

      example.net.               86400   IN NS      ns1.example.com.
      example.net.               86400   IN NS      ns2.example.com.
      ns1.example.net.           86400   IN A       198.51.100.1
      ns2.example.net.           86400   IN A       198.51.100.2

3.4.  Promoted (or orphaned) glue

   When a zone is deleted but the parent notices that its NS glue
   records are required for other zones, it MAY opt to take these (now
   orphaned) glue records into its own zone to ensure that other zones
   depending on this glue are not broken.  Technically, these NS records
   are no longer glue records, but authoritative data of the parent
   zone, and should be added to the DNS response similarly to regular
   glue records.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies correct DNS server behaviour and does not
   introduce any changes or new security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no actions for IANA.
