Abstract 
      
     This document describes a portion of the Policy Information Base 
     (PIB) to control policy usage collection and reporting in a device. 
      
     The provisioning classes specified here allow a Policy Decision 
     Point (PDP) to select which policy objects should collect usage 
     information, what information should be collected and when it 
     should be reported. 
      
     This PIB requires the presence of other PIBs (defined elsewhere) 
     that provide the policy objects that usage information is collected 
     from.

1 Introduction  
    
   The Framework of COPS-PR Usage Feedback describes the overall 
   approach to policy usage monitoring and reporting. This document 
   defines the specific Policy Information Base (PIB) framework for 
   policy usage feedback. The policy classes for monitoring and 
   reporting policy usage feedback as well as policy classes for 
   controlling reporting intervals, suspension, resumption and 
   solicitation are defined. 
    
2 General Concepts  
     
2.1 Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies  
    
   There are three basic types of policy used to define what the PEP is 
   to monitor, record and report. These are the selection criteria 
   policy, the usage policy and the feedback report linkage policy.  
         
   The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP. It defines the 
   conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy. The 
   selection criteria policy may only be used for defining usage 
   feedback selection criteria. However, the more general case is that a 
   policy that already exists for policy enforcement may also be used 
   for specifying feedback usage selection criteria. An example of this 
   is the frwkRoleCombo instance, which may be used in defining QoS 
   enforcement policies but may also be used to specify conditions on 
   which to base usage - i.e. count the number of packets meeting the 
   criterion of an interface capability set name and role combination.  
        
   The usage policy defines what attributes are recorded by the PEP. 
   These policies have an ACCESS clause of 'report-only'. Generally, the 
   usage policies specify counts related to a specific action such as a 
   packet being dropped. The feedback framework PIB defines two usage 
   policy classes, frwkFeedbackTraffic and frwkFeedbackIfTraffic. Usage 
   PRCs may be generic, collecting basic statistics, or they may be 
   specific to a particular usage. The PDP decides which PRC(s) best 
   suit(s) its requirements. The PEP may support only one usage feedback 
   PRC, in which case all statistics are gathered using instances of 
   that PRC. Alternatively, the PEP may support multiple usage feedback 
   PRCs. The PDP then decides which PRC to associate with a particular 
   selection criterion.  
           

   A usage feedback policy and selection policy are tightly associated 
   with one another. A third policy, the frwkFeedbackLinkTable, is used 
   to associate, or provide a linkage for the selection and usage 
   policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable also specifies when to report the 
   usage feedback.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable entry permits the same 
   selection criteria instance to be re-used for various usage feedback 
   policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable contains the value of the 
   selection criteria instance as well as the value of the usage 
   feedback PRC.

                               Figure 1  
     
   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the selection criteria, 
   linkage and usage policies.   
        
   The PDP is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage feedback 
   policy when installing the selection criteria and feedback linkage 
   policies. The usage feedback policy is instantiated on the PEP by the 
   installation of a feedback report linkage and the PEP designates the 
   instance identifier. The usage feedback policy class always contains 
   an attribute of type ReferenceId that contains the instance value of 
   the associated frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance installed by the PDP. 
   An example of this is the attribute frwkFeedbackTrafficLinkRef 
      
    
2.2 Normal Operations 
    
2.2.1 Connection Establishment and Initial Configuration Request   
        
   The Accounting Timer object in the COPS Connection Accept message 
   contains the minimum number of seconds between reporting intervals as 
   described in [COPS] and [FEEDBACKfWK]. This is used as the basic unit 
   of measurement in defining intervals for specific usage policies with 
   the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute.  
    
   The PEP notifies the PDP of the selection criteria policy classes and 
   usage policy classes it supports during the initial request for 
   configuration data using frwkPRCSupport instances [FR-PIB]. The PEP 
   also indicates whether it supports the frwkFeedbackLinkTable as well. 
         
   The PDP responds to the initial request for configuration with a 
   DECISION that installs policies. The PDP may also specify maximum 
   reporting intervals associated with each of the usage policies. This 
   is done with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute in the 
   frwkFeedbackLink class. It may also specify reporting thresholds by 
   including an instance of a threshold class (e.g. 
   frwkFeedbackTrafficThreshold) in the decision. The PEP monitors and 
   records the usage per the conditions defined by its associated 
   selection criteria policy. Periodically the PEP reports the usage 
   with a REPORT message or provides a REPORT when solicited by the PDP. 
   The PDP solicits usage feedback with the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator 
   attribute of the frwkFeedbackAction class.

2.2.2 Unsolicited Reports - Periodic Reporting 
    
   Reporting may be periodic in nature and unsolicited. The intervals 
   at which the unsolicited reports are provided by the PEP are defined 
   in the specific Linkage policies. The defined intervals are based on 
   the number of seconds specified by the PDP in the ACCT Timer value. 
   The PDP may specify that the associated usage instance be included 
   in a periodic unsolicited report only if the threshold is reached 
   and/or if the usage value has changed from the previous reporting 
   interval.  
    
   There are cases when the PEP must supply unsolicited feedback 
   reports that may not fall on an interval boundary. The PEP MUST 
   provide an unsolicited REPORT containing all defined usage instances 
   just prior to the PEP issuing a Delete Request State and just prior 
   to the PEP de-activating a PIB instance context. 
 
2.2.3 Unsolicited Reports - Reporting Conditions 
 
   Periodic unsolicited reports for individual usage feedback instances 
   can be suppressed by specifying additional conditions in the 
   frwkFeedbackLink instances. Supported conditions are: 
   ChangeOnly 
        If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags attribute, the 
        associated usage instance is only included in a periodic 
        unsolicited report if its value changed since the last 
        unsolicited report.  
         
   Threshold 
        If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags attribute, the 
        associated usage instance is only included in a periodic 
        unsolicited report, if the threshold condition referenced in 
        the frwkLinkThreshold field evaluates successfully for the 
        associated usage instance.  
         
   Both conditions can be combined in one frwkFeedbackLinkUsage object. 
   In this case both conditions need to succeed for the usage instance 
   to be reported. 
    
   Unsolicited reports triggered by a Delete Request State or the 
   deactivation of a PIB instance are not subject to these conditions - 
   all usage objects must be included in these cases.  
 
 
2.2.4 Solicited Reports 
    
   The PDP may solicit policy usage feedback by issuing an unsolicited 
   Decision containing the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to 
   'solicitReport'. The PEP is to provide a solicited REPORT feedback 
   containing usage feedback. The PEP shall continue to provide 
   periodic feedback as well at the specified intervals established at 
   client connection acceptance. 

  
Rawlins et al.            Expires June 2003                  [Page 5] 
Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB                  June 2002 
 
 
   The reporting conditions (ChangeOnly and Threshold) do not affect 
   solicited reports - all requested usage instances must be included. 
  
2.2.5 Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting    
                                                                                                

   The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and tracking at the PEP with the 
   frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to 'suspendMonitoringAndReports'. The 
   PEP must stop tracking usage information and must not issue any 
   feedback reports. The PDP may only suspend feedback reporting by 
   setting the ActionIndicator to 'suspendReports'. The PEP must cease 
   sending unsolicited reports but is to continue monitoring and 
   tracking usage. The PDP may resume the sending of feedback reports 
   and may resume usage monitoring by setting the ActionIndicator to 
   'resume'.  
    
   The PDP may suspend or resume all usage instances or the PDP may 
   specify one or more instances that are to be suspended or resumed. 
   The frwkFeedbackActionList attribute contains a tag identifier that 
   references a list of one or more frwkFeedbackActionList instances. 
    
   The PDP may halt usage monitoring, tracking and reporting of usage 
   policies by removing the associated Linkage entry.  
    
    
2.2.6 Failover   
        
   In the event the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the PEP 
   continues to track usage information as long as it continues to 
   operate with the installed policy. When the locally installed policy 
   at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.  
        
   Upon successful reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy, 
   the PDP indicates to the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the 
   COPS accounting type report messages. The PDP does this by issuing an 
   unsolicited decision containing the frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator set 
   to 'resume'. The PEP should resume reporting at the next appropriate 
   feedback interval established upon the acceptance of the re-
   connection.  The PDP is aware of the request state Handle(s) and the 
   supported PRCs either through the state synchronization mechanism or 
   because the PDP considers itself synchronized with the PEP upon 
   reconnection.   
 
2.3 Usage Policy and Under-specified Selection Criteria 
    
   Some of the usage policy objects created in the PEP with COPS-PR can 
   be used by the PEP multiple times - they effectively act as 
   templates for the objects created by the PEP. COPS-PR only has the 
   identity (OID) of the object that is shared between all the 
   assignments the PEP created, however it is desirable to collect 
   usage information for each of the derived objects individually.  
    
   This capability is achieved in the feedback framework PIB by 
   distributing additional information to qualify a specific assignment 

  
Rawlins et al.            Expires June 2003                  [Page 6] 
Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB                  June 2002 
 
 
   of an object between the selection criteria PRC and the feedback 
   usage PRC. 
    
   A selection criteria PRC that refers to a shared object but contains 
   no qualifying information selects all of the object's assignments. 
   Such a selection criteria PRC SHOULD be combined with a feedback 
   usage PRC that includes all the necessary information to identify a 
   specific assignment - a single selection criteria policy can then 
   result in the generation of many feedback usage objects, one for 
   each derived object. 
    
   If the selection criteria PRC contains all the required qualifying 
   attributes for a specific assignment, it is combined with a feedback 
   usage PRC that only contains the desired metrics but no additional 
   attributes. 
    
   Example: 
  
      A frwkRoleCombo instance may be used as a selection criteria, 
      identifying a set of interfaces through their the role 
      combination and capability set. If it is desired to get per-
      interface traffic statistics, the usage PRC has to include an 
      additional attribute to qualify the specific interface. 
    
      This could be achieved by linking the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic class 
      with a frwkRoleCombo instance in a frwkFeedbackLink instance. 
      Multiple frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances will be created by the 
      PEP, one for each interface selected by the frwkRoleCombo 
      instance. The frwkFeedbackIfTraffic class contains the 
      frwkFeedbackIfTrafficIfIndex attribute that allows the PDP to 
      identify each interface's individual counters when the PEP 
      reports the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances. 
    
      If traffic usage collection is only desired for an individual 
      interface, a selection criteria should be used that qualifies the 
      interface completely, for example a frwkIfRoleCombo instance. 
      In this case it can be linked to the usage class that has no 
      additional qualifying attributes, frwkFeedbackTraffic. 
 
 
          
3 Summary of the Feedback Framework Policy Information Base  
           

3.1 SPPI ACCESS clause report-only    
           
   The selection criteria and linkage policy classes follow the 
   definitions specified by [SPPI]. This structure specifies well-
   defined policy classes and their instances residing in a common, 
   virtual repository [FR-PIB]. The additional PIB-ACCESS clause 
   attribute of "report-only" denotes the usage policy class reported by 
   the PEP.  
    
3.2 Usage32 and Usage64 textual conventions 

  
Rawlins et al.            Expires June 2003                  [Page 7] 
Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB                  June 2002 
 
 
    
   The SPPI does not support the Counter32/64 textual conventions (TC) 
   of SNMP - for feedback collection two similar textual conventions 
   have been defined in this PIB: Usage32 and Usage64. 
 
   In addition to the differential functionality of 'Counter', where 
   only the difference between two samples generally carries 
   information, a single value of a 'Usage' attribute usually provides 
   absolute information, since 
   - its initial value is known (0) 
   - no wrap-around events should occur 
   - the time or event when the initial value was set should be    
     available directly or indirectly from other objects. 
    
   When 'Usage' attributes are defined in a PRC, events that could 
   cause a reset of the attribute to it's initial value should be 
   defined in the description as well as the mechanism that allows the 
   PDP to detect the time of the last reset. 
    
   No usual COPS activity however should cause the reset of a Usage 
   attribute. In the case of a suspension of monitoring activity 
   (frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to 'suspendMonitoringAndReports'), 
   'Usage' attributes should keep their values and continue counting 
   after monitoring is resumed. 
    
3.3 Feedback Groups and PRCs  
           
   These policy classes defined in this PIB are common to account type 
   reporting for various technologies and apply to ALL SUBJECT-
   CATEGORIES. The policy classes are divided into three new groups, 
   namely, The Feedback Report Group, The Feedback Usage Group and The 
   Feedback Selection Group.  
    
   The policy classes in the Feedback Report Group are:  
      - Feedback Action   
      - Feedback Action List  
      - Feedback Selection Usage Combination Capability  
      - Feedback Linkage  
      - Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold  
 
   The policy classes in the Feedback Usage Group are:  
      - Feedback Traffic   
      - Feedback Interface Traffic   
       
   The policy class in the Feedback Selection Group is: 
      - Feedback RoleCombo Filter Selection  
 
3.3.1 Feedback Action  
    
   The Feedback Action class contains the attributes that specify 
   action that the PEP is to take regarding policy usage, monitoring 
   and tracking. The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and periodic 
   reporting, suspend periodic reporting only, resume usage and 
  
Rawlins et al.            Expires June 2003                  [Page 8] 
Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB                  June 2002 
 
 
   periodic reporting or solicit immediate reporting. The action may 
   affect all feedback policies or be associated with one or more 
   frwkFeedbackLink instances. 
    
   The frwkFeedbackActionIndicator attribute defines the action. The 
   frwkFeedbackActionPri attribute indicates whether the action applies 
   to all of the usage policies or to a list. The 
   frwkFeedbackActionList attribute is the identifier of the list of 
   Linkage policy instances to which the action is to be applied. 
    
   The PDP can solicit the PEP for immediate usage feedback. The PEP 
   shall respond with a solicited report containing the usage feedback. 
    
   The PDP can direct the resumption of usage monitoring and reporting 
   per the defined intervals. For example, the PEP may have re-
   connected to a PDP and has cached usage policies. The PDP indicates 
   to the PEP to resume usage tracking and monitoring and to send all 
   the cached usage policy.  The PEP shall respond at the next 
   appropriate interval with an unsolicited report containing the usage 
   feedback. 
    
   The PDP can suspend the monitoring of usage policy. The PEP 
   maintains the current usage that has been monitored but discontinues 
   any further monitoring until the PDP directs the PEP to resume 
   monitoring in a subsequent Decision. 
    
   The PDP can also suspend just the reporting of usage, but not 
   interrupt the monitoring and tracking of usage. The PEP shall 
   discontinue sending Report messages with usage feedback until the 
   PDP directs the PEP to resume. The PEP then begins reporting the 
   usage feedback at the next interval. 
    
        
3.3.2 Feedback Action List  
 
    
   This class defines sets of linkage instances that can be referred to 
   from the frwkFeedbackActionList attribute.  
    
3.3.3 Feedback Linkage Capability  
    
   This class defines the valid selection criteria PRC, usage PRC and 
   threshold PRC combinations supported by the PEP. 
    
3.3.4 Feedback Linkage  
     
   This class links the selection criteria instance with the usage 
   class. This table permits the reuse of a selection criteria instance 
   for multiple usage policies.

   usage instance. A value of 0 in this attribute indicates that the 
   usage policy must be solicited. 
     
3.3.5 Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold  
    
   This class is used to provide threshold values for the attributes 
   described in the traffic usage classes below.  
 
3.3.6 Feedback Traffic   
  
   This class includes the packet counts, byte counts and a reference to 
   the associated Linkage instance. 
      
3.3.7 Feedback Interface Traffic   
 
   This class is similar to the previous Feedback Traffic class, except 
   that it includes an additional reference to an interface index. This 
   class should be used with a selection criteria instance that matches 
   an element that is assigned to multiple interfaces. The interface 
   field can be used to associate the instances of this table with the 
   specific element's assignment. 
 
   
3.3.8 Feedback RoleCombo Filter Selection  
  
   This class is used as selection criteria based on role combination, 
   capability set and a filter instance.

                The Usage32 type is intended to reflect the absolute

                If conditions other than the reset of the COPS

                Whenever the monotonic increase of Usage32 is violated, 
                it should be reset to 0 and the fact that this occurred

5 Security Considerations    
 
  This PIB defines structured information that may be sensitive when 
  transported by the COPS protocol [COPS-PR]. 
   
  This PIB does not contain classes that directly contain security 
  relevant information like passwords or monetary amounts, however 
  unauthorized access or changes to information defined in this PIB 
  could compromise network operations or reveal sensitive business or 
  personal information. 
  Specifically for the classes: 
  frwkFeedbackLinkCaps 
  
Rawlins et al.            Expires June 2003                 [Page 28] 
Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB                  June 2002 
 
 
      This class has the ACCESS clause 'notify'. Access to this 
      information reveals feedback collection capabilities of the COPS 
      client and malicious changes could affect feedback operation by 
      misleading the server to generate corrupt feedback configuration. 
  frwkFeedbackLinkTable, frwkFeedbackAction, frwkFeedbackActionList, 
  frwkFeedbackTrafficThres, frwkFeedbackRoleFilterSel 
      These classes have the ACCESS clause 'install' and allow the COPS 
      server to control feedback collection and reporting on the 
      client. Access to this information exposes the client's 
      configuration, malicious changes could disrupt network or 
      business operations and raise privacy issues. 
  frwkFeedbackTraffic, frwkFeedbackIfTraffic 
      These classed have the ACCESS clause 'report-only' and contain 
      the usage information delivered from the COPS client to the 
      server. Unauthorized access to this information may reveal 
      detailed information on the network and its users. Malicious 
      changes may affect network and business operations. 
 
  [COPS] and [COPS-PR] define mechanisms to secure the COPS protocol 
  communication and implementations of COPS servers or clients 
  supporting this PIB MUST follow the security guidelines specified 
  there. 
 
 
6 IANA Considerations 
    
  This document describes the frwkFeedbackPib Policy Information Base 
  (PIB) module for standardization under the "pib" branch registered 
  with IANA. An IANA assigned PIB number is requested for this PIB 
  under the "pib" branch. 
   
  This PIB uses "all" in the SUBJECT-CATEGORY clause, so it applies to 
  all COPS client types. No new COPS client type is requested for this 
  PIB.
