1. Introduction
   
   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
   protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it
   describes managed objects for modeling a Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) [MPLSArch][MPLSFW] based traffic
   engineering. This MIB should be used in conjunction with
   the companion document [LSRMIB] for MPLS based traffic
   engineering configuration and management.
   
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list
   at mpls@uu.net.
   
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard
   for the Internet community.


2. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the MPLS architecture
   document [MPLSArch] and MPLS Label Switch Router MIB
   [LSRMIB]. Some frequently used terms are described next.
   
   An explicitly routed LSP (ERLSP) is referred to as an MPLS
   tunnel.  It consists of one in-segment and/or one out-
   segment at the ingress/egress LSRs, each segment being
   associated with one MPLS interface.  These are also
   referred to as tunnel segments.  Additionally, at an
   intermediate LSR, we model a connection as consisting of
   one or more in-segments and/or one or more out-segments.
   The binding or interconnection between in-segments and out-
   segments in performed using a cross-connect. These objects
   are defined in the MPLS Label Switch Router MIB [LSRMIB].


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271
      [SNMPArch].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
      for the purpose of management.  The first version of
      this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is
      called SMIv1 and described in RFC 1155 [SMIv1], RFC



Srinivasan, et al.            Expires January 2001           [Page 2]

Internet Draft        MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       14 July 2000



      1212 [SNMPv1MIBDef] and RFC 1215 [SNMPv1Traps].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902
      [SMIv2], RFC 1903 [SNMPv2TC] and RFC 1904 [SNMPv2Conf].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP message
      protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157
      [SNMPv1].  A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [SNMPv2c] and RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM].  The third version
      of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described
      in RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM], RFC 2272 [SNMPv3MP] and RFC
      2574 [SNMPv3USM].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1157
      [SNMPv1].  A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [SNMPv2PO].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273
      [SNMPv3App] and the view-based access control mechanism
      described in RFC 2575 [SNMPv3VACM].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the SMI.  This memo specifies a MIB module that is
   compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can
   be produced through the appropriate translations.  The
   resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent,
   except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
   textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
   process.  However, this loss of machine-readable
   information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB.


3.1.  Object Definitions
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract
   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In

Internet Draft        MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       14 July 2000



   particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
   descriptor, to also refer to the object type.


4. Feature List
   
   The MPLS traffic engineering MIB is designed to satisfy the
   following requirements and constraints.
   
   -  The MIB supports configuration of point-to-point
      unidirectional tunnels.
   
   -  MPLS tunnels need not be interfaces, but it is possible
      to configure a tunnel as an interface.
   
   -  The MIB supports manually configured MPLS tunnels as
      well as those set up via any MPLS signaling protocol.
   
   -  The MIB supports persistent as well as non-persistent
      tunnels.


5. Outline
   
   Traffic engineering support for MPLS tunnels requires the
   following configuration.
   
   -  Setting up MPLS tunnels along with appropriate
      configuration parameters.
   
   -  Configuring tunnel loose and strict source routed hops.
   
   These actions may need to be accompanied with corresponding
   actions using [LSRMIB] to establish and configure tunnel
   segments, if this is done manually. Also, the in-segment
   and out-segment performance tables, mplsInSegmentPerfTable
   and mplsOutSegmentPerfTable [LSRMIB], should be used to
   determine performance of the tunnels and tunnel segments.


5.1.  Summary of Traffic Engineering MIB
   
   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist of the
   following tables.



Srinivasan, et al.            Expires January 2001           [Page 4]

Internet Draft        MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       14 July 2000



   
   -  Tunnel table (mplsTunnelTable) for setting up MPLS
      tunnels.
   
   -  Resource table (mplsTunnelResourceTable) for setting up
      the tunnel resources.
   
   -  Tunnel hop table (mplsTunnelHopTable) for configuring
      strict and loose source routed MPLS tunnels hops.
   
   When a tunnel is signaled via a MPLS signaling protocol,
   the mplsTunnelARHopTable gives the actual list of hops
   traversed by the tunnel as reported by the signaling
   protocol.  These tables are described in the subsequent
   sections.


6. Brief Description of MIB Objects
   
   The objects described in this section support the
   functionality described in documents [RSVPTun][CR-LDP].
   The tables support both manually configured and signaled
   tunnels.


6.1.  mplsTunnelTable
   
   The mplsTunnelTable allows new MPLS tunnels to be created
   between an MPLS LSR and a remote endpoint, and existing
   tunnels to be reconfigured or removed.  Note that we only
   support point-to-point tunnel segments, although multi-
   point-to-point and point-to-multi-point connections are
   supported by an LSR acting as a cross-connect.  Each MPLS
   tunnel can thus have one out-segment originating at an LSR
   and/or one in-segment terminating at that LSR.
   
   mplsTunnelTable does not define the in and out segments
   forming the tunnel.  Instead, these are defined by creating
   rows in the in-segment and out-segment tables, defining
   relationships in the cross-connect table and referring to
   these rows in the mplsTunnelTable using a cross-connect
   index, mplsTunnelXCID. These segment and cross-connect
   related objects are defined in [LSRMIB].


6.2.  mplsTunnelResourceTable
   
   mplsTunnelResourceTable is used to indicate the resources



Srinivasan, et al.            Expires January 2001           [Page 5]

Internet Draft        MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       14 July 2000



   required for a tunnel. Multiple tunnels may share the same
   resource by pointing to the same entry in this table.
   Tunnel that do not share resource must point to separate
   entries in this table.


6.3.  mplsTunnelHopTable
   
   mplsTunnelHopTable is used to indicate the hops, strict or
   loose, for an MPLS tunnel defined in mplsTunnelTable, when
   it is established via signaling.  Multiple tunnels may
   share the same hops by pointing to the same entry in this
   table. Each row also has a secondary index,
   mplsTunnelHopIndex, corresponding to the next hop of this
   tunnel.  The scalar mplsTunnelMaxHops indicates the maximum
   number of hops that can be specified on each tunnel
   supported by this LSR.


6.4.  mplsTunnelARHopTable
   
   mplsTunnelARHopTable is used to indicate the actual hops
   traversed by a tunnel as reported by the MPLS signaling
   protocol after the tunnel is setup.  The support of this
   table is optional since not all MPLS signaling protocol may
   support this feature.


7. Application of the Interface Group to MPLS Tunnels
   
   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed
   objects for managing interfaces.  This memo contains the
   media-specific extensions to the Interfaces Group for
   managing MPLS Tunnels as logical interfaces.
   
   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces
   Group to be in accordance with [IFMIB] which states that
   the interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the
   managed resource's interfaces and that each sub-layer below
   the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered
   an interface.  Thus, the MPLS interface is represented as
   an entry in the ifTable.  The interrelation of entries in
   the ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in
   [IFMIB].
   
   When using MPLS Tunnels as interfaces, the interface stack
   table might appear as follows:

        +------------------------------------------+
        | MPLS-Tunnel-interface ifType = mpls(150) |
        +------------------------------------------+
        |     MPLS-interface ifType = mpls(166)    |
        +------------------------------------------+
        |            Underlying Layer              |
        +------------------------------------------+
   
   
   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer" refers to the
   ifIndex of any interface type, which has been defined for
   MPLS interworking.  Examples include ATM, Frame Relay,
   Ethernet, etc.

8. Example of Tunnel Setup

   This section contains an example of which MIB objects
   should be modified if one would like to create a best
   effort, loosely routed, unidirectional traffic engineered
   tunnel, which spans two hops of a simple network. Note
   that these objects should be created on the "head-end"
   LSR.
   
   In mplsTunnelTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelIndex             = 1,
     mplsTunnelInstance          = 1,
     mplsTunnelName              = "My first tunnel",

Internet Draft        MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       14 July 2000



     mplsTunnelDescr             = "Here to there",
     mplsTunnelIsIf              = true (1),
     mplsTunnelIfIndex           = 12,
     mplsTunnelXCPointer         = mplsXCIndex.2.0.0.15,
     mplsTunnelSignallingProto   = none (1),
     mplsTunnelSetupPrio         = 0,
     mplsTunnelHoldingPrio       = 0,
     mplsTunnelSessionAttributes = 0,
     mplsTunnelOwner             = snmp (1),
     mplsTunnelLocalProtectInUse = false (0),
     mplsTunnelResourcePointer   = mplsTunnelResourceIndex.5,
     mplsTunnelInstancePriority  = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopTableIndex     = 1,
     mplsTunnelRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)
   }
   
   In mplsTunnelResourceTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelResourceIndex           = 5,
     mplsTunnelResourceMaxRate         = 0,
     mplsTunnelResourceMeanRate        = 0,
     mplsTunnelResourceMaxBurstSize    = 0,
     mplsTunnelResourceRowStatus       = createAndGo (4)
   }
   
   The next two instances of mplsTunnelHopEntry are used to
   denote the hops this tunnel will take across the network.
   
   The following denotes the beginning of the network, or the
   first hop. We have used the fictitious LSR identified by
   "123.123.125.1" as our example head-end router.
   
   In mplsTunnelHopTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelHopListIndex          = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopIndex              = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopAddrType           = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopIpv4Addr           = 123.123.125.1,
     mplsTunnelHopIpv4PrefixLen      = 9,
     mplsTunnelHopStrictOrLoose      = loose (2),
     mplsTunnelHopRowStatus          = createAndGo (4)
   }
   
   The following denotes the end of the network, or the last
   hop in our example. We have used the fictitious LSR
   identified by "123.123.126.1" as our end router.
   
   In mplsTunnelHopTable:

   {
     mplsTunnelHopListIndex          = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopIndex              = 2,
     mplsTunnelHopAddrType           = 1,
     mplsTunnelHopIpv4Addr           = 123.123.126.1,
     mplsTunnelHopIpv4PrefixLen      = 9,
     mplsTunnelHopStrictOrLoose      = loose (2),
     mplsTunnelHopRowStatus          = createAndGo (4)
   }


9. The Use of RowPointer
   
   RowPointer is a textual convention used to identify a
   conceptual row in an SNMP Table by pointing to one of its
   objects.  In this MIB, in mplsTunnelTable, the objects
   mplsTunnelXCPointer and mplsTunnelResourcePointer are of
   type RowPointer. The object mplsTunnelXCPointer points to a
   specific entry in the mplsXCTable [LSRMIB].  This entry in
   the mplsXCTable is the associated LSP for the given MPLS
   tunnel entry. The object mplsTunnelResourcePointer points
   to a specific entry in a traffic parameter table. An
   example of such a traffic parameter table is
   mplsTunnelResourceTable. It indicates a specific instance
   of a traffic parameter entry that is associated with a
   given MPLS tunnel entry.

         the next unassigned index after each retrieval
         operation. After a manager retrieves a value the

   DESCRIPTION
        "The mplsTunnelARHopTable is used to indicate the
         hops, strict or loose, for an MPLS tunnel defined in
         mplsTunnelTable, as reported by the MPLS signaling
         protocol, for the outgoing direction of the tunnel.
         Each row in this table is indexed primarily by the
         same indices, mplsTunnelIndex and
         mplsTunnelInstance, as the row of the corresponding
         tunnel in mplsTunnelTable.  Each row also has a
         third index mplsTunnelARHopIndex, corresponding to
         the next hop that this row corresponds to.  The
         first row in the table is the first hop after the
         origination point of the tunnel.  In case we want to
         specify a particular interface on the originating
         LSR of an outgoing tunnel by which we want packets
         to exit the LSR, we specify this as the first hop
         for this tunnel in mplsTunnelARHopTable.
        
         Please note that since the information necessary to
         build entries within this table are not provided by
         some MPLS signaling protocols, implementation of
         this table is optional. Furthermore, since the
         information in this table is actually provided by
         the MPLS signaling protocol after the path has been

11.   Security Considerations
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this
   MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or
   read-create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments. The support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network
   operations.
   
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these
   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   object when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not
   all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
   environment.
   
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec
   [IPSEC]), there is no control as to who on the secure
   network is allowed to access and GET/SET
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. It is
   recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
   Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model
   [SNMPv3USM] and the View- based Access Control
   [SNMPv3VACM] is recommended. It is then a customer/user
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving
   access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured
   to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
