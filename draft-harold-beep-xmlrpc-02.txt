Abstract

   XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Calling protocol that works over the
   Internet.  It defines an XML format for messages that are transfered
   between clients and servers using HTTP.  An XML-RPC message encodes
   either a procedure to be invoked by the server, along with the
   parameters to use in the invocation, or the result of an invocation.
   Procedure parameters and results can be scalars, numbers, strings,
   dates, etc.; they can also be complex record and list structures.

   This document specifies a how to use the Blocks Extensible Exchange
   Protocol (BEEP) to transfer messages encoded in the XML-RPC format
   between clients and servers.

Internet-Draft           Using XML-RPC in BEEP              October 2002


1. Introduction

   This memo specifies how messages encoded in the XML-RPC [1] format
   are transmitted using a BEEP profile [2].

   Throughout this memo, the terms "request" and "response" refer to the
   "methodCall" and "methodResponse" elements defined by the XML-RPC
   specification [1].  Further the terms "peer", "client", "server", and
   "one-to-one" are used in the context of BEEP.  In particular,
   Sections 2.1 and 2.1.1 of [2] discuss BEEP roles and exchange styles.

2. BEEP Profile Identification

   The BEEP profile for XML-RPC is identified as

       http://iana.org/beep/transient/xmlrpc

   in the BEEP "profile" element during channel creation.

   In BEEP, when the first channel is successfully created, the
   "serverName" attribute in the "start" element identifies the "virtual
   host" associated with the peer acting in the server role, e.g.,

       <start number='1' serverName='stateserver.example.com'>
           <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/transient/xmlrpc' />
       </start>

   The "serverName" attribute is analagous to HTTP's "Host" request-
   header field (c.f., Section 14.23 of [3]).

   There are two states in the BEEP profile for XML-RPC, "boot", the
   profile's initial state, and "ready":

   o  In the "boot" state, the peer requesting the creation of the
      channel sends a "bootmsg" (either during channel initialization or
      in a "MSG" message).

      *  If the other peer sends a "bootrpy" (either during channel
         initialization or in a "RPY" message), then the "ready" state
         is entered

      *  Otherwise, the other peer sends an "error" (either during
         channel initialization or in a "ERR" message), and no state
         change occurs.

   o  In the "ready" state, the initiating peer begins an XML-RPC
      message pattern by sending a "MSG" message containing a request.
      The other peer completes the message pattern by sending back a
      "RPY" message containing a response.

2.1 Profile  Initialization

   The boot message is used to identify the resource accessed by the
   channel bound to the BEEP profile for XML-RPC.

   The DTD syntax for the boot message and its response are:

       <!ELEMENT bootmsg     EMPTY>
       <!ATTLIST bootmsg
                 resource    CDATA             #REQUIRED>

       <!ELEMENT bootrpy     EMPTY>

   The boot message contains a single mandatory attribute: "resource",
   which is analagous to HTTP's "abs_path" Request-URI parameter (c.f.,
   Section 5.1.2 of [3])

   If the peer acting in the server role recognizes the requested
   resource, it replies with a boot response.  Otherwise, if the boot
   message is improperly formed, or if the requested resource isn't
   recognized, the peer acting in the server role replies with an error
   message (c.f., Section 7.1 of [2]).

   Typically, the boot message and its response are exchanged during
   channel initialization (c.f., Section 2.3.1.2 of [2]).

   For example, here the boot message and its response are exchanged
   during channel initialization:

       C: <start number='1' serverName='stateserver.example.com'>
       C:     <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/transient/xmlrpc'>
       C:         <![CDATA[<bootmsg resource='/NumberToName' />]]>
       C:     </profile>
       C: </start>

       S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/transient/xmlrpc'>
       S:     <![CDATA[<bootrpy />]]>
       S: </profile>

   The channel bound to the BEEP profile for XML-RPC is now in the
   "ready" state.

   Alternatively, here is an example in which the boot exchange is
   unsuccessful:

       C: <start number='1' serverName='stateserver.example.com'>
       C:     <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/transient/xmlrpc'>
       C:         <![CDATA[<bootmsg resource='/NameToCapital' />]]>
       C:     </profile>
       C: </start>

       S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/transient/xmlrpc'>
       S:     <![CDATA[<error code='550'>resource not
       S:                                supported</error>]]>
       S: </profile>

   Although the channel was created successfully, it remains in the
   "boot" state.

3. XML-RPC Message Packages

   The BEEP profile for XML-RPC transmits requests and responses encoded
   as UTF-8 using the media type "application/xml" [4], e.g.,

       I: MSG 1 1 . 0 364
       I: Content-Type: application/xml
       I:
       I: <?xml version="1.0"?>
       I:   <methodCall>
       I:     <methodName>examples.getStateName</methodName>
       I:     <params>
       I:       <param>
       I:         <value><i4>41</i4></value>
       I:       </param>
       I:     </params>
       I:   </methodCall>
       I: END

   and its associated response

       L: RPY 1 1 . 201 100
       L: Content-type: application/xml
       L:
       L: <?xml version="1.0"?>
       L:   <methodResponse>
       L:     <params>
       L:       <param>
       L:         <value><string>South Dakota</string></value>
       L:       </param>
       L:     </params>
       L:   </methodRespose>
       L: END

4. XML-RPC Message Exchange

   A request/response exchange involves sending a request, which results
   in a response being returned.

   The BEEP profile for XML-RPC achieves this using a one-to-one
   exchange, in which the client sends a "MSG" message containing an
   request, and the server sends back a "RPY" message containing an
   response.

   The BEEP profile for XML-RPC does not use the "ERR" message for XML-
   RPC faults when performing one-to-one exchanges ù whatever response
   is generated by the server is always returned in the "RPY" message.

Internet-Draft           Using XML-RPC in BEEP              October 2002


5. URL Schemes

   This memo defines two URL schemes, "xmlrpc.beep" and "xmlrpc.beeps",
   which identify the use of XML-RPC over BEEP over TCP.  Note that, at
   present, a "generic" URL scheme for XML-RPC is not defined.

5.1 The xmlrpc.beep URL Scheme

   The "xmlrpc.beep" URL scheme uses the "generic URI" syntax defined in
   Section 3 of [5], specifically:

   o  the value "xmlrpc.beep" is used for the scheme component; and,

   o  the server-based naming authority defined in Section 3.2.2 of [5]
      is used for the authority component.

   o  the path component maps to the "resource" component of the boot
      message sent during profile initialization (if absent, it defaults
      to "/").

   The values of both the scheme and authority components are case-
   insensitive.

   For example, the URL

       xmlrpc.beep://stateserver.example.com/NumberToName

   might result in the example shown in Section 2.1.

5.1.1 Resolving IP/TCP Address  Information

   The "xmlrpc.beep" URL scheme indicates the use of the BEEP profile
   for XML-RPC running over TCP/IP.

   If the authority component contains a domain name and a port number,
   e.g.,

       xmlrpc.beep://stateserver.example.com:1026

   then the DNS is queried for the A RRs corresponding to the domain
   name, and the port number is used directly.

   If the authority component contains a domain name and no port number,
   e.g.,

       xmlrpc.beep://stateserver.example.com

   the SRV algorithm [6] is used with a service parameter of "xmlrpc-

   beep" and a protocol parameter of "tcp" to determine the IP/TCP
   addressing information.  If no appropriate SRV RRs are found (e.g.,
   for "_xmlrpc-beep._tcp.stateserver.example.com"), then the DNS is
   queried for the A RRs corresponding to the domain name and the port
   number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration in Section
   6.4.

   If the authority component contains an IP address, e.g.,

       xmlrpc.beep://10.0.0.2:1026

   then the DNS is not queried, and the IP address is used directly.  If
   a port number is present, it is used directly; otherwise, the port
   number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration in Section
   6.4.

   While the use of literal IPv6 addresses in URLs is discouraged, if a
   literal IPv6 address is used in a "xmlrpc.beep" URL, it must conform
   to the syntax specified in [7].

5.2 The xmlrpc.beeps URL Scheme

   The "xmlrpc.beeps" URL scheme is identical, in all ways, to the
   "xmlrpc.beep" URL scheme specified in Section 5.1, with the exception
   that prior to starting the BEEP profile for XML-RPC, the BEEP session
   must be tuned for privacy.  In particular, note that both URL schemes
   use the identical algorithms and parameters for address resolution as
   specified in Section 5.1.1 (e.g., the same service name for SRV
   lookups, the same port number for TCP, and so on).

   There are two ways to perform privacy tuning on a BEEP session,
   either:

   o  a transport security profile may be successfully started; or,

   o  a user authentication profile that supports transport security may
      be successfully started.

   In either case the client must present the authority component of the
   URL in the "serverName" attribute of the "start" element it uses to
   tune the session for privacy.

   When TLS is used for privacy the client must verify that the
   authority component of the URL matches the server's identity as
   presented in the server's certificate.  Section 2.4 of [9] describes
   the matching process.

   Although service provisioning is a policy matter, at a minimum, all
   implementations must provide the following tuning profiles:

   for  authentication: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5

   for confidentiality: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher)

   for both: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher supporting client-side
      certificates)

   Further, implementations may choose to offer MIME-based security
   services providing message integrity and confidentiality, such as
   OpenPGP [8] or S/MIME [10].

   Regardless, consult [2]'s Section 9 for a discussion of BEEP-specific
   security issues.

Appendix B. IANA Considerations

   If the IESG approves this memo for publication, then the IANA
   registers the profile specified in Section 6.1, and selects an IANA-
   specific URI, e.g.,

       http://iana.org/beep/xmlrpc

   The IANA registers "xmlrpc.beep" and "xmlrpc.beeps" as URL schemes,
   as specified in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3, respectively.

   The IANA registers "XML-RPC over BEEP" as a TCP port number, as
   specified in Section 6.4.

Appendix C. Revision History

   Note to RFC editor: please remove this entire appendix, and the
   corresponding entries in the table of contents, prior to publication.

C.1 Changes from draft-harold-beep-xmlrpc-00

      Clarified the relationship between XML-RPC and HTTP in the
      abstract


C.2 Changes from draft-harold-beep-xmlrpc-01

      Refer to RFC 2732 rather than 2472 for format of IPv6 Addresses in
      URLs

      Update reference to "Using SOAP over BEEP" from I-D to RFC 3288

      Require clients to present the URL authority component in the
      "serverName" attribute of the "start" element used to tune for
      privacy when using an xmlrpc.beeps URL

      Require clients tuning with TLS to verify the server's identity
      via the process described in Section 2.4 of RFC 2595

      Added an example of tuning for privacy when using an xmlrpc.beeps
      URL
