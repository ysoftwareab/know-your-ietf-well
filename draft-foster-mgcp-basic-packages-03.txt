Abstract 
 
  This document provides a basic set of MGCP packages. The generic, 
  line, trunk, handset, RTP, DTMF, announcement server and script 
  packages are updates of packages from RFC 2705 with additional 
  explanation and in some cases new versions of these packages. In 
  addition to these, five new packages have been added. These are the 
  signal lists, resource reservation, media format, supplementary 
  services tones and digit map extension packages.

           ------------------------------------------- 
          | Package                        |   name   | 
          |-------------------------------------------|

          | Script Package                 |   Script | 
           ------------------------------------------- 
 
1.2. Changes to Existing Packages 
 
1.2.1. Change in signal types 
 
  MGCP 1.0 as defined in RFC 2705 provided some additional 
  clarification on the meaning of OO signals compared to earlier 
  versions of MGCP. This lead to some inconsistency in some of the 
  signal definitions in the accompanying packages. This has been 
  corrected in the packages that are included here by changing some of 
  the signals from type OO to type TO. 
   
1.2.2. Operation Complete and Operation Failure 
 
  Another change also made to improve consistency and interoperability 
  was to add the "operation complete" and "operation failure" events in 
  packages where there are TO events defined but where the events were 
  not included as part of the package. By definition, all packages that 
  contain Time-Out type signals now contain the operation failure 
  ("of") and operation complete ("oc") events as defined in [1], 
  irrespective of whether they are provided as part of the package 
  description or not.  
   
  If a package without Time-Out signals does contain definitions for 
  the "oc" and "of" events, the event definitions provided in the 
  package may over-ride those indicated here. Such practice is however 
  discouraged and is purely allowed to avoid potential backwards 
  compatibility problems.  
    

 
Arango et al.                Informational                     [Page 2] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  It is considered good practice to explicitly mention that these two 
  events are supported in accordance with their default definitions. If 
  no definition is included in the package, the above syntax and 
  semantics is assumed.  
   
  Please refer to [1] for additional details on these events.  
 
1.2.3. Package Versions 
 
  Some of the packages included in this document are new versions of 
  packages that were previously contained in RFC 2705. The base 
  specification [1] provides an optional capability of auditing package 
  versions. Any gateway that implements versioned packages SHOULD also 
  implement this option. 
   
1.2.4. Event Definitions, Aliases and Interoperability Issues 
 
  Some event definitions or clarifications of previous event 
  definitions have also been added in order to improve 
  interoperability.  
   
  In some cases events have aliases either in the same or in other 
  packages and a recommendation has been made for the use of alternates 
  by Call Agents for future implementations. For maximum 
  interoperability, gateways MUST still implement these events (in fact 
  they MUST implement all of the events, signals, etc. in a package). 
   
  Some events that were previously defined require specific 
  provisioning in both the gateway and the Call Agent in order to allow 
  for interoperability. In those cases, a warning to that affect has 
  been included. 
   
1.2.5. New Events 
   
  In some cases new events have been added to existing packages. Any 
  changes to existing packages of course have resulted in the version 
  number being updated from unversioned (version 0) to version 1. 
   
1.3. New Packages and Excluded Packages 
 
  Two packages from RFC 2705 have not been included. These are the "MF" 
  and the "NAS" package. These packages are still valid as are all 
  unversioned (version 0) packages defined in RFC 2705. The reason 
  these packages were not included: 
   
     * The original MF package had no defined way to outpulse MF digits 
       - so that a separate RFC was developed for MF CAS (RFC 3064). 
     * The "N" package as defined in RFC 2705 was incomplete. A more 
       complete MGCP "NAS" package has been developed and provided as a 
       separate Internet draft. 
   
  New packages have also been included beyond what was included in the 
  original RFC 2705. The Resource Reservation ("RES") and Media Format 
  ("FM") packages in particular are different from other packages in 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                     [Page 3] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  this document in that they do not contain events and signals but 
  simply define extra LocalConnectionOptions. This is allowed by the 
  new extension rules in [1]. Future packages of this type MUST use a 
  packages prefix in front of local connection options ("<package-
  name>/<Local Connection Option>") so as to avoid name-space problems. 
  However because of the timing of the arrival of these packages 
  relative to updating MGCP 1.0 this was not done for the "RES" and 
  "FM" packages. The resulting new local connection options will be 
  registered with IANA. For future cases where a package prefix is 
  included, only the package name needs to be registered. 
 
2. Packages 
   
  For those packages that involve MGCP events, the terms "signal" and 
  "event" are used to differentiate a request from a Call Agent to a 
  Media Gateway to apply an event ("signal"), from requesting the 
  detection of an "event" that occurs on the Media Gateway and is 
  "Notified" to the Call Agent. 
   
  For packages that involve events and signals the tables contain five 
  columns: 
 
      Symbol:  the (package) unique symbol used to identify the event. 
 
      Definition:   a short description of the event. 
 
      R:  an x appears in this column if the event can be requested by 
      the Call Agent. Alternatively, one or more of the following 
      symbols may appear. An "S" is included if the event-state may be 
      audited. A "C" indicates that the event can be detected on a 
      connection, and a "P" indicates the event is persistent. 
 
      S: if nothing appears in this column for an event, then the event 
      cannot be signaled by the Call Agent. Otherwise, the following 
      symbols identify the type of event: 
 
      * OO     On/Off signal. 
 
      * TO     Time-Out signal. 
 
      * BR     Brief signal. 
 
      In addition, a "C" will be included if the signal can be 
      generated on a connection. 
 
      Duration: specifies the duration of TO signals. If a duration is 
      left unspecified then the default timeout will be assumed to be 
      infinite unless explicitly noted in the description of the 
      signal. A duration may also be declared as being variable in a 
      case where signals involve complex sequencing (e.g. scripts or 
      digit out-pulsing) where the amount of time may vary with either 
      processing time or the signaling environment. 
       

 
Arango et al.                Informational                     [Page 4] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

      Default time-out values may be over-ridden by the Call Agent for 
      any Time-Out event defined in this document by a "to" signal 
      parameter which specifies the timeout value in milliseconds (see 
      [1]). Example: 
 
         S: sst/cw(to=20000) 
   
      indicates a timeout value of 20 seconds. 
   
  In some of the signal definitions below, specific tone definitions 
  are provided even though actual frequencies may vary from country to 
  country. Country variations SHOULD be handled by gateway 
  provisioning. 
   
   
2.1.  Generic Media Package 
 
  Package Name: G 
  Version: 1 
   
  The generic media package groups the events and signals that can be 
  observed on several types of endpoints, such as trunk gateway 
  endpoints, access gateway endpoints or residential gateway endpoints. 
   
      --------------------------------------------------------------- 
     | Symbol   |   Definition               |   R | S     Duration  | 
     |---------------------------------------------------------------| 
     | cf       |   Confirm tone             |     | BR              | 
     | cg       |   Congestion tone          |     | TO    infinite  | 
     | ft       |   Fax tone detected        |   x |                 | 
     | it       |   Intercept tone           |     | TO    infinite  | 
     | ld       |   Long duration connection |   C |                 | 
     | mt       |   Modem detected           |   x |                 | 
     | oc       |   Operation complete       |   x |                 | 
     | of       |   Operation failure        |   x |                 | 
     | pt       |   Preemption tone          |     | TO    infinite  | 
     | rt       |   Ringback tone            |     | TO,C 180 seconds| 
     | rbk(###) |   Ringback                 |     | TO,C 180 seconds| 
     | pat(###) |   Pattern Detected         |   x | OO              | 
      --------------------------------------------------------------- 
   
  New events added to this package from the previously unversioned 
  package: "oc" 
   
  Changes: "it" and "pt" signals changed from OO to TO. 
   
  The events are defined as follows: 
   
  Confirmation Tone (cf): This is also referred to as "positive 
  indication tone" in ITU-T E.182. In North America, Confirmation Tone 
  uses the same frequencies and levels as dial tone (350 and 440 Hertz) 
  but with a cadence of 0.1 second on, 0.1 second off repeated three 
  times. See GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: SIGNALING, Section 17.2.4. It is 
  considered an error to try and play confirmation tone on a phone that

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  is on hook and an error should consequently be returned when such 
  attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on hook).  
   
  Congestion Tone (cg): Refer to ITU-T E.180 and E.182. This maps to 
  re-order tone in North America (refer to GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: 
  SIGNALING, Section 17.2.7). 
   
  Fax tone (ft): The fax tone event is generated whenever a fax call is 
  detected by the presence of V.21 fax preamble. The fax tone event 
  SHOULD also be generated when the T.30 CNG tone is detected. See ITU-
  T Recommendations T.30 and V.21. 
   
  Intercept tone(it): This is a country specific tone as defined in 
  ITU-T, E.180 Supplement 2.  
   
  Long Duration (ld): The "long duration connection" is detected when a 
  connection has been established for more than some time. The default 
  value is 1 hour, however the provisioning process may change this. 
   
  The event is detected on a connection. When no connection is 
  specified as part of the request, the event applies to all 
  connections for the endpoint, regardless of when the connections are 
  created. The "all connections" may also be used for this case, and is 
  in fact preferred for consistency. In either case, the name of the 
  connection on which the event was detected will be included when the 
  event is observed, e.g.: 
   
    G/ld@0A3F58 
   
  Modem tones (mt): Indicates V.25 Answer tone with or without phase 
  reversals or V.8 Modified Answer Tone (ANSam) tone with or without 
  phase reversals. Note that this implies the presence of a data call. 
  Also note that despite the name of the event, devices other than 
  modems may generate such tones, e.g. a fax machine. 
   
  Preemption Tone (pt):  This is a country specific tone and is defined 
  in ITU-T, E.180 Supplement 2. 
 
  Ring back tone (rt):  Refer to ITU E.180 and ITU E.182. Also 
  referred to as ringing tone - a tone advising the caller that a 
  connection has been made and that a calling signal is being applied 
  to the called party or service point. In North America this tone is a 
  combination of two AC tones with frequencies of 440 and 480 Hertz and 
  levels of -19 dBm each, to give a combined level of -16 dBm. The 
  cadence for Audible Ring Tone is 2 seconds on followed by 4 seconds 
  off. See GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: SIGNALING, Section 17.2.5.  
   
  This signal can be applied directly to an endpoint or alternatively 
  on a connection using the syntax "rt@connectionID". When the ringback 
  signal is applied to an endpoint, it is considered an error to try 
  and play ring back tones, if the endpoint is considered on hook and 
  an error should consequently be returned when such attempts are made 
  (error code 402 - phone on hook). When the ringback signal is applied 
  to a connection, no such check is to be made.  
 
Arango et al.                Informational                     [Page 6] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

   
  Note that as specified in [1], signals requested on a connection MUST 
  be played regardless of the connection mode. For example, in a call-
  waiting situation, ringback tone may be played on a connection in 
  "inactive" mode. 
   
  Ringback (rbk): is an alias for rt@connectionID and is included here 
  for backwards compatibility only. It is recommended that Call Agents 
  use rt@connectionID instead of rbk(connectionID) for ring-back over a 
  connection for new implementations. Although the ringback signal is 
  applied on a connection, the "rbk" signal does not support the 
  "@connection" syntax.  
   
  pat(###): pattern detected. This event requires special provisioning 
  that needs to be agreed on between the Call Agent and media gateway 
  in order to ensure interoperability. It is retained in order to 
  maintain backwards compatibility with version 0 of the "G" package.

  Note that DTMF tones including the DTMF tones wildcard can use the 
  eventRange notation defined in [1] when requesting events, e.g. 
  "D/[0-9](N)". 
   
  The events are defined as follows: 
   
  DTMF tones (0-9,*,#,A,B,C,D): Detection and generation of DTMF 
  signals is described in GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: SIGNALING, Section 15. 
  Note that it is considered an error to try and play DTMF tones on a 
  phone that is on hook and an error should consequently be returned 
  when such attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on hook). The 
  events can be specified in a digit map. When requested as a signal, 
  as per GR-506-CORE, section 15, a minimum tone duration of 50 ms will 
  be followed by a minimum interdigit silence period of 45 ms, i.e. if 
  requested in a signal list such as S: sl/s(d/5,d/6,d/7), then 
  interdigit timing requirements will be satisfied. 
 
  Long Duration Indicator (l): The "long duration indicator" is 
  observed when a DTMF signal is produced for a duration larger than 
  two seconds. In this case, the gateway will detect two successive 
  events: first, when the signal has been recognized, the DTMF signal, 
  and then, 2 seconds later, the long duration signal.  
   
  DTMF Tone Duration (dd(dg=<tone>,to=<time>)): This event can be used 
  to indicate if/when the specified <tone>, has a duration greater than 
  the <time> value indicated (and is reported once when the duration is 
  exceeded). The value of <tone> can be any of the DTMF tone symbols 
  specified in the DTMF package (including X in the case of events, but 
  not signals). If this parameter is absent, any DTMF tone that occurs 
  will be reported. The parameter <time> is in milli-seconds and may be 
  rounded to the nearest 10 ms by the gateway. The minimum value of 
  <time> that can be requested when requesting an event is 40 ms. When 
  requesting a signal, the minimum value of <time> that can be 
  requested is 50 ms. The maximum value of the <time> that can be 
  requested for either an event or a signal is 60000 ms. If the 
  "to=<time>" parameter is absent when requested as an event, the event 
  will report the full duration of the tone when the tone is completed. 
  When reported as an ObservedEvent, both parameters are always 
  supplied. In this case <tone> is the actual tone detected and <time> 
  is either: 
   
     * The <time> specified in the request (possibly rounded), or 
   
     * If the request did not contain a "to=<time>" parameter, the full 
       duration of the tone. 
 
  When used as a signal, "dd" provides the ability to generate a DTMF 
  tone as a TO signal. When applied as a signal, an additional 50 ms of 
  silence will be tacked onto the end before the operation complete 
  occurs i.e. S: dd(dg=5,to=2500) will play the DTMF tone for the 
  number "5" for 2.5 seconds, followed by 50 ms of silence period. The 
  operation complete (if requested) will be notified after the silence 
  interval occurs. Any value between 50 ms and 60000 ms can be

  requested. Gateways generating or detecting the tone may round-off 
  the requested time to the nearest 10 ms. 
   
  The "dd" event can be used in place of the "l" event in order to 
  detect a digit pressed for longer than 2 seconds. For example, in 
  order to detect if a user presses the long "#" for longer than 2 
  seconds, a request could be made with the RequestedEvents line  
  "R: d/dd(N)(dg=#,to=2000)". The resulting ObservedEvents line would 
  be "O: d/dd(dg=#,to=2000)". 
   
  Suppose instead, that the RequestedEvents line contains  
   
     R: d/[0-9*#],d/dd 
      
  Suppose the user then pushes the "#" for 2.5 seconds. In this case, 
  two events will be notified: 
   
     O: d/# 
   
  when the "#" key is first pressed, and 
   
     O: d/dd(dg=#,to=2500) 
   
  when the "#" key is finally depressed. 
   
  If instead, the Requested event line had contained 
   
    R: d/dd(N)(to=40),d/dd 
   
  In that case, almost the same results would be obtained: 
   
     O: d/dd(dg=#,to=40) 
   
  after the "#" key is pressed for 40 ms, and 
   
     O: d/dd(dg=#,to=2500) 
   
  when the "#" key is finally depressed. 
   
  DTMF OO signal (do(dg=<tone>,<on-or-off>)): This signal is used to 
  generate a DTMF tone as an on-off signal. The <tone> parameter is any 
  of the symbols for a specific tone in the DTMF package (i.e. "0" to 
  "9", "A", "B", "C", "D", "*", or "#"). The <on-or-off> indicator is 
  "+" for on and "-" for off as usual. The <tone> parameter MUST be 
  supplied, otherwise a return code of 538 - "Event/signal parameter 
  error" will be provided in the response. If the <on-or-off> parameter 
  is missing, the default is to turn the signal on (i.e. "+" is the 
  default). The order of the parameters is not significant since "+" 
  and "-" are reserved characters and are easily distinguished from the 
  <tone> parameter. 
   
  Operation complete (oc):   This is the standard definition of 
  operation complete.

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  Operation failure (of):    This is the standard definition of 
  operation failure. 
   
  DTMF tones wildcard (X): The DTMF tones wildcard matches any DTMF 
  digit between 0 and 9. The actual event code generated will however 
  be the event code for the digit detected. The DTMF tones wildcard is 
  often used to detect DTMF input to be matched against a digit map. 
   
  Timer (t): Timer T is a digit input timer that can be used in two 
  ways: 
    
   *  When timer T is used with the accumulate according to digit map 
      action, the timer is not started until the first DTMF tone is 
      entered, and the timer is restarted after each new DTMF tone is 
      entered until either a digit map match or mismatch occurs. In 
      this case, timer T functions as an inter-digit timer as 
      illustrated by: 
       
          R: D/[0-9T](D)  
    
   *  When timer T is used without the accumulate according to digit 
      map action, the timer is started immediately and simply cancelled 
      (but not restarted) as soon as a DTMF tone is entered. In this 
      case, timer T can be used as an inter-digit timer when overlap 
      sending is used, as in: 
       
          R: D/[0-9](N), D/T(N) 
       
   When used with the "accumulate according to digit map" action, timer 
   T takes on one of two values, T-partial or T-critical. When at least 
   one more symbol is required for the "current dial string" to match 
   any one of the patterns in the digit map, timer T takes on the value 
   T-partial, corresponding to partial dial timing. If a timer is all 
   that is required to produce a match, timer T takes on the value T-
   critical corresponding to critical dial timing. When timer T is used 
   without the accumulate according to digit map action, timer T takes 
   on the value T-critical. The default value for T-partial is 16 
   seconds and the default value for T-critical is 4 seconds. The 
   provisioning process may alter both of these. If timer T is not 
   used, then inter-digit timing will not be performed. 
    
   The following examples illustrate this. Consider the digit map: 
    
     (xxxxxxx|x11T) 
    
   and assume that DTMF and the timer T is accumulated according to 
   digit map. At the first DTMF input, say "4", timer T is started with 
   a value of T-partial since at least one more symbol is required. If 
   "1" is then input, it leads to a restart of timer T with a value of 
   T-partial again. If "1" is now input again, we have a current dial 
   string of "411" and a timer is now all that is required to produce a 
   match. Hence timer T is now restarted with value T-critical.

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

   Finally, consider the following subtle examples (all assuming DTMF 
   and timer T being accumulated according to digit map):  
    
   The digit map  
    
     (1[2-3T].) 
    
   will match immediately on the input "1" since zero or more matches 
   of the range are specified.  
    
   The digit map 
    
     (1[2-3].T) 
    
   and an input of "1" will lead to timer T being set to T-critical. 
    
   A digit map of  
    
     (1[2-3]T.) 
    
   and an input of "1" will lead to timer T being set to T-partial. 
   Furthermore, upon subsequent input of "2" or "3" a perfect match 
   will trigger immediately since timer T is completely irrelevant.

  New events added to this package from the previously unversioned 
  package: "oc", "mm", "qt", "sit", and "tp". 
   
  Changes in event types: "co1", "co2", "nm", "om", "tl", "zz" signals 
  changed from OO to TO; "as" and "bl" changed from OO to BR. 
   
   
  The definition of trunk package events are as follows: 
   
  Continuity Tone (co1): A tone at 2010 Hz (see section 3.1.1.3 of 
  [13]). When generated as a signal, the frequency of the tone must be 
  within + or - 8 Hz, while the frequency of the tone corresponding to 
  the event must be within + or - 30 Hz. 
   
  Continuity Test (co2): A tone at 1780 Hz (see section 3.1.1.3 of 
  [13]). When generated as a signal, the frequency of the tone must be 
  within + or - 20 Hz, while the frequency of the tone corresponding to 
  the event must be within + or - 30 Hz. 
   
  In continuity testing the tone corresponding to the signal at the 
  originating gateway is referred to as the "go" tone and the tone 
  corresponding to the event at that same gateway is referred to as the 
  "return" or "check" tone. 
   
  Note that generation and notification of continuity tones are done as 
  per continuity test requirements as defined in ITU-T Q.724 as well as 
  by Bellcore GR-317-CORE specifications e.g. the semantics of 
  notification of the return tone is more than that the tone was 
  received, but is an indication that the test has passed. Details are 
  provided in the following paragraphs. 
   
  The continuity tones represented by co1 and co2 are used when the 
  Call Agent wants to initiate a continuity test. There are two types 
  of tests, single tone and dual tone and in the case of the dual-tone 
  either tone can be sent and the opposite received depending on the 
  trunk interconnections (4-wire or 2-wire) as indicated below: 
   
       Originating                               Terminating 
       ============                              =========== 
   
          4w   -------------- 1780 Hz ----------->  2w 
               <------------- 2010 Hz ------------  (transponder) 
   
          2w   -------------- 2010 Hz ----------->  2w/4w 
               <------------- 1780 Hz ------------  (transponder) 
   
          4w   -------------- 2010 Hz ----------->  4w 
               <------------- 2010 Hz ------------  (loopback) 
 
   
  The Call agent is expected to know, through provisioning information, 
  which test should be applied to a given endpoint. As an example, for 
  a 4-wire to 2-wire connection, the Call Agent might send a request 
  like the following to an originating gateway: 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 12]

     RQNT 1234 ds/ds1-1/17@tgw2.example.net 
     X: AB123FE0 
     S: t/co1 
     R: t/co2,t/oc,t/of 
   
  On a terminating side of a trunk, the call agent may request a 
  continuity test connection (connection mode "conttest") to the 
  terminating gateway as follows: 
   
     CRCX 3001 ds/ds1-2/4@tgw34.example.net 
     C: 3748ABC364 
     M: conttest 
   
  The originating gateway would send the requested "go" tone, and would 
  look for the appropriate "return tone". Once the return tone is 
  received, the originating gateway removes the go tone and checks to 
  see that return tone has been removed within specified performance 
  limits (i.e. GR-246-CORE, T1.113.4, Annex B). When it detects that 
  the test is successful, the gateway will send a notification of the 
  return tone event (Note that notification of the return tone event 
  therefore must not be sent prior to detection of the removal of the 
  return tone). 
   
  The signals corresponding to the continuity tones are TO signals so 
  that an operation complete event will occur when the signal times 
  out. If a timeout value other than the default is desired, the "to" 
  parameter may be used (e.g. "S: co1(to=2000)"). 
   
  If the gateway detects the failure of the continuity test prior to 
  the timeout, an operation failure event will be generated. Otherwise 
  the failure of the continuity test is determined by the failure to 
  receive the return tone event before the timeout occurs (operation 
  complete event). As with TO signals in general, operation complete 
  and operation fail events are parameterized with the name of the 
  signal. 
   
  In the example above where the go tone is "co1" and the return tone 
  is "co2": 
   
     * A notification of the "co2" event indicates success ( i.e.  
       "O: t/co2") 
     * A notification of the operation fail event indicates failure 
       prior to timeout (i.e. "O: t/of(t/co1)") and 
     * A notification of the operation complete event, indicates that 
       the return tone was not received properly prior to the 
       occurrence of the timeout (i.e. "O: t/oc(t/co2)") 
   
  On a terminating end of a trunk, either a "loopback" connection 
  (single tone test) or "conttest" connection (dual tone test) are 
  made. It is up to the termination end to make sure that the return 
  tone is removed as soon as the go tone disappears. The Call Agent 
  requests the removal of "contest" or "loopback" connections at a 
  termination end when the results of the continuity test are obtained.

  When "conttest" is used, the endpoint is provisioned as to which 
  transponder test is being performed (2010 Hz received and 1780 Hz 
  sent or vice versa). 
   
  An alternative to "conttest" and "loopback" connection modes, is to 
  use the "lb" signal in this package. 
   
  Note that continuity tones in the trunk package are only ever sent to 
  the telephony endpoint. For network-based continuity, there are 
  continuity tones available in the RTP ("R") package. Although a 
  transponder (dual tone) test can be done, a single tone test is 
  generally sufficient in the case of continuity testing across an IP 
  network. 
 
  Loopback (lb(in=<tone-in>,out=<tone-out>, <+ or ->): This signal is 
  used to provide loopback or transponder functionality independent of 
  connection mode, i.e. this is an alternative way to provide the same 
  functionality as "conttest" and "loopback" connection modes. The 
  <tone-in> and <tone-out> parameters can have values "co1" or "co2" 
  corresponding to the 2010 Hz and 1780 Hz tones associated with those 
  symbols. If these parameters are left out, the value of <tone-in> 
  defaults to 2010 Hz and the value of <tone-out> defaults to 1780 Hz. 
  The provisioning process may alter these default values (in fact 
  these default values would be incorrect for a test from a 4-wire 
  switch to a 2-wire switch). 
   
  On detecting <tone-in>, <tone-out> will be generated in return. The 
  tone corresponding to <tone-out> will continue to be generated until 
  either: 
   
     * The loopback signal is explicitly turned off (e.g. "S: t/lb(-)") 
       or 
     * Removal of the <tone-in> tone is detected. 
 
  Note that while the loop-back signal is active (regardless of whether 
  a tone is active or not), media from the endpoint will not be 
  forwarded to the packet network (i.e. the loopback signal must be 
  explicitly turned off by the Call Agent in order to allow media to be 
  forwarded to the endpoint).

  Reorder Tone(ro): This maps to congestion tone in the ITU E.182 
  specification. In North America, reorder tone is a combination of two 
  AC tones with frequencies of 480 and 620 Hertz and levels of -24 dBm 
  each, to give a combined level of -21 dBm. The cadence for reorder 
  tone is 0.25 seconds on followed by 0.25 seconds off, repeating 
  continuously (until time-out). See GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: SIGNALING, 
  Section 17.2.7. 
 
  Special Information Tone(sit(###)): As described in ITU-T E.180, the 
  special information tone consists of a tone period in which 3 tones 
  are produced followed by a silent period of 1 second (total TO period 
  of approximately 2 seconds). When used as a signal, it MUST be 
  parameterized with a parameter value from 1 to 7 with the following 
  meaning as defined in SR-2275, section 6.21.2 [6]: 
   
       ------------------------------------------- 
      | sit(1) | RO' | reorder SIT, intra-LATA    | 
      | sit(2) | RO" | reorder SIT, inter-LATA    | 
      | sit(3) | NC' | no circuit SIT, intra-LATA | 
      | sit(4) | NC" | no circuit SIT, inter-LATA | 
      | sit(5) | IC  | intercept SIT              | 
      | sit(6) | VC  | vacant code SIT            | 
      | sit(7) | IO  | ineffective other SIT      | 
       ------------------------------------------- 
       
       
  When requested as an event, the event MUST be parameterized with a 
  decimal number from 1 to 7 to indicate which tone the gateway is 
  required to detect. The resulting notification also includes the 
  parameter. Other countries may have one or more special information 
  tones with country specific definitions (refer to ITU-T E.180 supp. 2 
  [3]). In this case special information tone 1 as defined in [3] is 
  sit(1), special information tone 2 is sit(2) etc. 
   
  As an example, the Call Agent might make a request such as: 
   
           RQNT 1234 ds/ds1-1/17@tgw2.example.net 
           X: AB123FE0 
           R: t/sit(N)(2) 
   
  If the tone is detected, the resulting notification might appear as 
  follows: 
   
      NTFY 3002 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0 
      X: AB123FE0 
      O: t/sit(2) 
   
  Line Test (tl): 105 Test Line test progress tone (2225 Hz + or - 25 
  Hz at -10 dBm0). Refer to section 8.2.5 of [6]. 
   
  Test Pattern (tp(##)): The tp(##) signal inserts the pattern ## 
  continuously into the channel until the timout period expires. The

  parameter is provided as a decimal number from 0 to 255. If the 
  parameter is omitted, the default value is decimal 95. 
   
  In RequestedEvents, the parameter MAY be supplied to indicate what 
  pattern the Call Agent wishes the gateway to detect. If the parameter 
  is omitted, the value 95 is assumed. The pattern MUST be returned in 
  the ObservedEvent (even if the parameter was not requested). 
   
  A typical use for the test pattern signal is for the test line 108 
  (digital loopback) test (refer to section 8.2.5 of [6]). At the 
  termination side of a trunk, the Call Agent would request a 
  connection in "loopback" mode, which would do a digital loopback. On 
  the origination side of the trunk, the Call Agent would request that 
  the test pattern be injected into the digital channel, and would 
  check to see that the pattern was returned within the timeout period. 
  As an example, the Call Agent would make the following request on the 
  origination side: 
   
           RQNT 1234 ds/ds1-1/17@tgw2.example.net 
           X: AB123FE0 
           S: t/tp 
           R: t/tp, t/oc, t/of 
   
  In this case the Call Agent will either receive: 
   
     * An ObservedEvent indicating that the test has passed  
       (i.e. "O:t/op(95)") or 
     * An ObservedEvent indicating that the timeout occurred before the 
       pattern was received (i.e. "O:t/oc(t/tp)"), indicating that the 
       test failed. Of course an operation failure would indicate 
       failure as well. 
   
   
  No circuit (zz):  This is an alias for Special Information Tone 2, 
  i.e. "sit(2)". 
      
  Answer Supervision (as): This event is used for off-hook representing 
  "answer" in CAS. An alternative is to use the "answer" event in the 
  appropriate CAS packages [12]. 
   
  Blocking (bl): This event is used to indicate an incoming off-hook 
  for the purposes of blocking a one-way trunk in CAS trunks. An 
  alternative is the "block" event in the appropriate CAS packages 
  [12].

  The description of events and signals in the line package are as 
  follows: 
   
  ADSI display (adsi): This signal is included here to maintain 
  compatibility with the previous version of this package. The signal 
  is not well-defined and its use is discouraged. 
 
  Answer tone (aw): This event is included here to maintain 
  compatibility with the previous version of this package. The event is 
  not well-defined and its use is discouraged. 
   
  Busy tone (bz): Refer to ITU E.180. In North America, station Busy is 
  a combination of two AC tones with frequencies of 480 and 620 Hertz 
  and levels of -24 dBm each, to give a combined level of -21 dBm. The 
  cadence for Station Busy Tone is 0.5 seconds on followed by 0.5 
  seconds off, repeating.  See GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: SIGNALING, Section 
  17.2.6. It is considered an error to try and play busy tone on a 
  phone that is on hook and an error should consequently be returned 
  when such attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on hook). 
   
  Caller Id (ci(time, number, name)): See TR-NWT-001188, GR-30-CORE, 
  and TR-NWT-000031. For backwards compatibility, each of the three 
  fields are optional, however each of the commas will always be 
  included. In accordance with the general MGCP grammar, it is however 
  RECOMMENDED to always include all three fields - an empty quoted 
  string can then be used in lieu of omitting a parameter: 
   
     The time parameter is coded as "MM/DD/HH/MM", where MM is a two-
     digit value for Month between 01 and 12, DD is a two-digit value 
     for Day between 1 and 31, and Hour and Minute are two-digit values 
     coded according to military local time, e.g., 00 is midnight, 01 
     is 1 a.m., and 13 is 1 p.m.  
      
     The number parameter is coded as an ASCII character string of 
     decimal digits that identify the calling line number. White spaces 
     are permitted if the string is quoted, however they will be 
     ignored. If a quoted-string is provided, the string itself is UTF-
     8 encoded (RFC 2279). 
      
     The name parameter is coded as a string of ASCII characters that 
     identify the calling line name. White spaces are permitted if the 
     string is quoted. If a quoted-string is provided, the string 
     itself is UTF-8 encoded (RFC 2279).  
      
     A "P" in the number or name field is used to indicate a private 
     number or name, and an "O" is used to indicate an unavailable 
     number or name. The following example illustrates the use of the 
     caller-id signal: 
   
     S: ci(10/14/17/26, "555 1212", somename) 
   
  Dial-tone (dl): Refer to the ITU E.180 specification. In North 
  America, dial tone is a combination of two continuous AC tones with 
  frequencies of 350 and 440 Hertz and levels of -13dBm each to give a 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 18] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  combined level of -10 dBm.  See GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: SIGNALING, 
  Section 17.2.1. It is considered an error to try and play dial-tone 
  on a phone that is on hook and an error should consequently be 
  returned when such attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on 
  hook). 
   
  Error tone (e): This tone is maintained for backwards compatibility. 
   
  Tone on-hold (ht): A tone used to reassure a calling subscriber who 
  has been placed on "hold". Refer to ITU-T E.182 [5]. 
   
  Line Side Answer Supervision (lsa): This provides Reverse Loop 
  Current Feed (RLCF) on the line (refer to GR-506-CORE [5]) and is a 
  way of indicating that the called party has answered for some line-
  side equipment. 
   
  Message Waiting Indicator (mwi): Message Waiting indicator tone uses 
  the same frequencies and levels as dial tone (350 and 440 Hertz at -
  13dBm each) but with a cadence of 0.1 second on, 0.1 second off 
  repeated 10 times followed by steady application of dial tone. See 
  GR-506-CORE - LSSGR: SIGNALING, Section 17.2.3. It is considered an 
  error to try and play message waiting indicator on a phone that is on 
  hook and an error should consequently be returned when such attempts 
  are made (error code 402 - phone on hook). 
   
  Network Disconnect (osi): indicates that the far-end party has 
  disconnected. The signal that is sent on the line is provisioned in 
  the media gateway since it may vary from country to country. In North 
  America this signal is an open switch interval which results in a 
  Loop Current Feed Open Signal (LCFO) being applied to the line (refer 
  to GR-506-CORE [5], see also See GR-505-CORE [15], Section 4.5.2.1). 
  The default time-out value for this signal is 900 ms. 
   
  Off-hook warning tone (ot): Off-hook warning tone, also known as 
  receiver Off Hook Tone (ROH Tone). This is the irritating noise a 
  telephone makes when it is not hung up correctly. In North America 
  ROH Tone is generated by combining four tones at frequencies of 1400 
  Hertz, 2060 Hertz, 2450 Hertz and 2600 Hertz at a cadence of 0.1 
  second on, 0.1 second off, repeating.  GR-506-CORE, Section 17.2.8 
  contains details about required power levels. It is considered an 
  error to try and play off-hook warning tone on a phone that is on 
  hook and an error should consequently be returned when such attempts 
  are made (error code 402 - phone on hook). 
   
  Ringing (rg): See GR-506-CORE [5], Section 14. The provisioning 
  process may define the ringing cadence. The ringing signal may be 
  parameterized with the signal parameter "rep" which specifies the 
  maximum number of ringing cycles (repetitions) to apply. The 
  following will apply the ringing signal for up to 6 ringing cycles: 
   
     S: l/rg(rep=6) 
   
  If the "rep" parameter is specified, the signal times-out when the 
  number of repetitions are completed (i.e. an operation complete event

  can be requested and will occur at the end of the timeout/number of 
  rings) 
   
  It is considered an error to try and ring a phone that is off hook 
  and an error should consequently be returned when such attempts are 
  made (error code 401 - phone off hook). 
   
  Distinctive ringing (r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6 or r7): See GR-506-
  CORE - [5], Section 14. Default values for r1 to r5 are as defined 
  for distinctive ringing pattern 1 to 5 in GR-506-CORE. The 
  provisioning process may define the ringing cadence for each of these 
  signals. The distinctive ringing signals may be parameterized with 
  the signal parameter "rep" which specifies the maximum number of 
  ringing cycles (repetitions) to apply. The following will apply the 
  ringing signal for up to 6 ringing cycles: 
   
     S: l/r1(rep=6) 
   
  If the "rep" parameter is specified, the signal times-out when the 
  number of repetitions are completed (i.e. an operation complete event 
  can be requested and will occur at the end of the timeout/number of 
  rings) 
   
  It is considered an error to try and ring a phone that is off hook 
  and an error should consequently be returned when such attempts are 
  made (error code 401 - phone off hook). 
   
  Reorder Tone (ro): This maps to congestion tone in the ITU E.182 
  specification. In North America, reorder tone is a combination of two 
  AC tones with frequencies of 480 and 620 Hertz and levels of -24 dBm 
  each, to give a combined level of -21 dBm. The cadence for reorder 
  tone is 0.25 seconds on followed by 0.25 seconds off, repeating 
  continuously.  
   
  Ringsplash (rs): also known as "Reminder ring" is a burst of ringing 
  that may be applied to the physical forwarding line (when idle) to 
  indicate that a call has been forwarded and to remind the user that a 
  CF sub-feature is active. In the US, it is defined to be a 0.5(-
  0,+0.1) second burst of power ringing. See Bellcore TR-TSY-000586 - 
  Call Forwarding Sub-features. 
   
  Special Information Tone(sit(###)): As described in ITU-T E.180, the 
  special information tone consists of a tone period in which 3 tones 
  are produced followed by a silent period of 1 second (total TO period 
  of approximately 2 seconds). It MAY be parameterized with a parameter 
  value from 1 to 7 with the following meaning as defined in SR-2275, 
  section 6.21.2 [6]:

  If the parameter is left out, the NC' SIT tone which corresponds to 
  the signal "t/sit(3)" is assumed. 
   
  Other countries may have one or more special information tones with 
  country specific definitions (refer to ITU-T E.180 supp. 2 [3]). In 
  this case special information tone 1 as defined in [3] is sit(1), 
  special information tone 2 is sit(2) etc. 
   
  Stutter Dial tone (sl): Stutter Dial Tone (also called Recall Dial 
  Tone in GR-506-CORE and "special dial tone" in ITU-T E.182) is used 
  to confirm some action and request additional input from the user. An 
  example application is to cancel call-waiting, prior to entering a 
  destination address.  
   
  The stutter dial tone signal may be parameterized with the signal 
  parameter "del" which will specify a delay in milliseconds to apply 
  between the confirmation tone and the dial tone. The following will 
  apply stutter dial tone with a delay of 1.5 seconds between the 
  confirmation tone and the dial tone: 
   
     S: sl(del=1500) 
   
  It is considered an error to try and play stutter dial tone on a 
  phone that is on hook and an error should consequently be returned 
  when such attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on hook). 
 
  Alerting Tone (v): a 440 Hz Tone of 2 second duration followed by 1/2 
  second of tone every 10 seconds. 
   
  Visual Message Waiting Indicator (vmwi): The transmission of the VMWI 
  messages will conform to the requirements in Section 2.3.2, "On-hook 
  Data Transmission Not Associated with Ringing" in Bellcore TR-H-
  000030 and the CPE guidelines in SR-TSV-002476. VMWI messages will 
  only be sent from the gateway to the attached equipment when the line 
  is idle. If new messages arrive while the line is busy, the VMWI 
  indicator message will be delayed until the line goes back to the 
  idle state. If the gateway does a restart (sends a Restart-in-
  Progress message, the Call Agent must refresh the CPE's visual 
  indicator. See TR-NWT-001401 - Visual Message Waiting Indicator 
  Generic Requirements; and GR- 30-CORE - Voiceband Data Transmission 
  Interface.

  Call Waiting tone1 (wt, wt1, .., wt4): Refer to ITU E.180. For North 
  American tone definitions refer to GR-506-CORE, Section 14.2. "wt" 
  and "wt1" are both aliases for the default Call Waiting tone which in 
  North America is a 440-Hz tone applied for 300  50 ms. The tone is 
  then repeated once after 10 seconds. 
   
  These signals are timeout signals with a default timeout value of 12 
  seconds, which allows the tone to be played twice with a single 
  request. However, there are cases (Requirement R3-73 of  
  GR-575-CORE), where only a single tone is required. In that case, the 
  Call Agent may make the request with a shorter timeout period to 
  eliminate the second tone (e.g. "S: wt(to=2000)" - which stops the 
  tone after 2 seconds so that the second tone will not occur). 
   
  Signals wt2, wt3 and wt4 are alternates that are used for distinctive 
  call-waiting tone patterns. The talking path should be interrupted 
  for a maximum of 400 ms for the application of CW tone. The Call 
  Agent implements the actual call waiting service - see TR-TSY-000571 
  - Call Waiting. It is considered an error to try and apply call 
  waiting tone on a phone that is on hook and an error should 
  consequently be returned when such attempts are made (error code 402 
  - phone on hook). 
 
  Recorder Warning Tone(y): Refer to ITU E.180 - also Bellcore document 
  SSR75 section 6.20. When recording equipment is used, this tone is 
  connected to the line to inform the distant party that the 
  conversation is being recorded  - typical value used is a 1400 Hz 
  Tone of 0.5 second duration every 15 seconds. 
 
  Calling Card Service Tone(z): This tone is used to inform the 
  customer that credit card information must be keyed in. Typically it 
  consists of 60 ms of 941 + 1477 Hz (the DTMF #digit) and 940 ms of 
  350 + 440 Hz (dial tone), decaying exponentially with a time constant 
  of 200 ms. Refer to Bellcore document SR2275, section 6.20. 
   
  Prompt tone (p): This signal is included here to maintain 
  compatibility with the previous version of this package. The prompt 
  signal is an alias for the calling card service tone ("z"). Future 
  implementations that require this signal should use "z". 
   
  Network Busy (nbz): This signal is included here to maintain 
  compatibility with the previous version of this package. The "nbz" 
  signal is an alias for re-order tone ("ro"). Future Call Agent 
  implementations that require a network busy signal should use the 
  "ro" signal. 
   
  Distinctive Tone Pattern (s): This signal is included here to 
  maintain compatibility with the previous version of this package. 
  This event requires special provisioning in the Call Agent and 
  gateway to insure interoperability.

  The handset emulation package is similar to the line package except 
  that events such as "off hook" can be signaled as well as detected. 
   
  Changes from the original package - are the same changes as were made 
  for the line package plus "hu" and "hd" signal types were changed 
  from OO to BR. 
   
  Signal definitions are the same as for the line package with the 
  following exceptions: 
   
  Visual Message Waiting: when requested as an event by the Call Agent, 
  the event is not parameterized. However, a parameter is included when 
  it is reported i.e.:

  Conference Depart(cd): Tone used to indicate that a participant has 
  left a conference call. The tone characteristics are left to the 
  specific gateway implementation.  
   
  Conference Join (cj): Tone used to indicate that a party has joined a 
  conference call. The tone characteristics are left to the specific 
  gateway implementation.  
   
  Comfort Tone (cm): used to indicate that the call is being processed 
  and that the caller should wait. Refer to E.182 [4]. 
   
  Caller Waiting Tone (cw): not to be confused with call-waiting tone - 
  a tone advising a caller that a called station, though busy, has a 
  call waiting service active. Refer to E.182 [4]. 
   
  Negative Indication (ni): A tone advising a subscriber that the 
  request for service cannot be accepted. Refer to E.182 [4]. For North 
  America, this maps to re-order tone. 
   
  Number Unobtainable Tone (nu): Refer to E.180, supplement 2 [3]. This 
  is also referred to as "vacant tone" and maps to "re-order tone" in 
  North America. 
   
  Pay Phone Recognition (pr): A tone advising an operator that the 
  endpoint is identified as a payphone. Refer to E.182 [4].

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  Permanent Signal Tone (pst): In North America, this tone is applied 
  to a busy line verify/operator interrupt under specific circumstances 
  as described in [16]. 
   
  Pay Tone (pt): a tone indicating that payment is required. Refer to 
  E.182 [4]. 
   
  Precedence Ringing (rgp): Ringing indicating special call precedence 
  (typically 20 Hz, 86 Volt ringing signal). The ringing signal may be 
  parameterized with the signal parameter "rep" which specifies the 
  maximum number of ringing cycles (repetitions) to apply. The 
  following will apply the ringing signal for up to 6 ringing cycles: 
   
     S: l/rg(rep=6) 
   
  If the "rep" parameter is specified, the signal times-out when the 
  number of repetitions are completed (i.e. an operation complete event 
  can be requested and will occur at the end of the timeout/number of 
  rings) 
   
  It is considered an error to try and ring a phone that is off hook 
  and an error should consequently be returned when such attempts are 
  made (error code 401 - phone off hook). 
   
   
  Precedence Ring Back Tone (rtp): Ringing tone advising the caller 
  that a connection has been made and that a precedence ringing signal 
  is being applied to the called party. This tone is normally a 
  combination of two AC tones with frequencies of 440 and 620 Hertz at 
  a level of -13 dBm. 
 
   
2.7.  Digit Map Extension 
   
  Package Name: dm1 
  Version: 0 
  Extension Digit Map Letters: P 
   
  This package defines an Extension Digit Map Letter that is used to 
  override the shortest possible match behavior for a given entry. The 
  letter "P" (for partial match override) at the end of a digit map 
  entry instructs the gateway to only consider this a match, if the 
  current dial string does not partially match another entry. For 
  example, given the digit map 
   
    ([3-7]11|123xxxxxxx|[1-7]xxxxxxP|8xxxP) 
   
  and a current dial string of "1234567" we would not consider this a 
  match, however a current dial string of "411" would be considered a 
  match. A current dial string of "8234" would be considered a match, 
  since there is no other partial match.

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  Note that the "P" is not an event, but simply a syntactic and 
  semantic digit map extension. Thus, the "P" is not included in the 
  list of requested or observed events.  
   
  Support for this package is strongly recommended. 
   
   
   
2.8.  Signal List Package 
 
  Package Name: SL 
  Version: 0 
 
    --------------------------------------------------------- 
   | Symbol  |   Definition             |  R  | S   Duration | 
   |---------------------------------------------------------| 
   | s(###)  |  Signal List             |     | TO  variable | 
   | oc      |  Operation complete      |  x  |              | 
   | of      |  Operation failure       |  x  |              | 
    --------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  Signal List(s(<list>)): The <list> contains a comma-separated list of 
  signals to be played out. Each of the signals in <list> MUST be 
  either of type BR or type TO. Semantically, the signal list is still 
  treated as a single parameterized signal of type Time-Out though. The 
  signals in the list are played to completion one after the other in 
  the left to right order specified. The package for each signal in the 
  list must be specified. For example, to play out the DTMF digits 
  123456: 
   
           S: sl/s(d/1,d/2,d/3,d/4,d/5,d/6) 
   
  This will result in the DTMF digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 being played 
  out in order.  
   
  It is illegal to include an OO signal as one of the signals in the 
  list or to request recursive definitions (signal lists within signal 
  lists). If this or any other unsupported signal is included, error 
  code 538 will be returned by the gateway. 
   
  Note that as the gateway plays the ordered list of signals, if it 
  encounters a TO signal with infinite timeout it will continue to play 
  that signal until requested to stop playing the "SL/S" signal (i.e. 
  other signals later in the list will never be played). 
   
  If the operation complete ("oc") event is requested, it will be 
  detected once, when the last signal in the list has been played out 
  (regardless of whether there are any TO signals in the list). The 
  operation complete event will only report the signal list name 
  itself, i.e. without the parameters supplied as in: 
     
    O:   sl/oc(sl/s)

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  Should any of the signals in the signal list result in an error, an 
  operation failure event will be generated. Only the signal list name 
  will be included, thus it is not possible to determine which signal 
  actually failed.  
   
  Note that if an event occurs while the "SL/S" signal is playing, the 
  "SL/S" signal is stopped in the following manner: 
   
     * If the signal in the list that was playing at the time the event 
       occurred is of type BR, then the BR signal will be played to 
       completion and no other signals in the list will be played. 
     * If the signal in the list that was playing at the time the event 
       occurred is of type TO, then the TO signal will stop immediately 
       and no other signals in the list will be played. 
   
  Operation complete (oc):   This is the standard definition of 
  operation complete. 
   
  Operation failure (of):    This is the standard definition of 
  operation failure. 
   
2.9.  Media Format Package 
 
  Package Name: FM 
  Version: 0 
 
  This package provides support for the media format Local Connection 
  Option (LCO). The media format LCO has a similar significance to the 
  "fmtp" attribute in SDP [8]. The media format parameter is encoded as 
  the keyword "fmtp" or "o-fmtp" followed by a colon and a quoted 
  string beginning with the codec name followed by a space, followed 
  the format associated with that codec. Multiple media formats may be 
  indicated by either repeating the "fmtp" local connection option 
  multiple times such as: 
   
    L:a:codec1;codec2, fmtp:"codec1 formatX", fmtp:"codec2 formatY" 
   
  or alternatively by having a single "fmtp" keyword followed by a 
  colon, and a semi-colon separated list of quoted strings for each 
  media format as in: 
   
    L:a:codec1;codec2, fmtp:"codec1 formatX";"codec2 formatY" 
   
  The two formats may be mixed.  
   
  If it is possible for the same codec to be requested with and without 
  the special "fmtp" format, the following could result: 
   
    L:a:codec1;codec1, fmtp:"codec1 formatX" 
   
  however it would not be clear if the fmtp parameter was to be applied 
  to the first or the second occurrence of the codec. The problem with 
  that is, that codec ordering is important (i.e. codecs are listed in 
  preferred order) and the above syntax does not provide a way to 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 27] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  indicate if "formatX" is preferred (i.e. associated with the first 
  "codec1") or not (i.e. associated with the second "codec1"). In order 
  to resolve this dilemma, when the same codec is requested with 
  multiple formats, the codec name in the "fmtp" format string is 
  followed by a colon and an <order> where <order> is a number from one 
  to N for N occurrences of the same codec in the codec list i.e.: 
   
     L:a:codec1;codec1, fmtp:"codec1:2 formatX" 
   
  indicates that "formatX" is associated with the second instance of 
  "codec1" in the "a:codec1;codec1" list. If an invalid instance number 
  is supplied (e.g. instance 3 where there are only two instances), 
  then error code 524 - inconsistency in local connection options will 
  be returned. 
   
  Pre-pending "fmtp" with the string "o-" (i.e. "o-fmtp") indicates 
  that the format is optional. In that case, the gateway may decide not 
  to use the fmtp parameter specified, or only use it in part. 
   
  If the "fmtp" in an LCO is not optional (i.e. does not have "o-" in 
  front of it), and the LCO value is either not recognized or not 
  supported, then the associated codec is considered "not supported".  
   
  When auditing capabilities, the "fmtp" local connection option MUST 
  be returned with a semi-colon separated list of supported formats 
  and/or multiple independent "fmtp" parameters as in: 
   
     A: a:telephone-event, fmtp:"telephone-event 0-15,32-35",... 
      
     A: a:PCMU;G729, fmtp:"PCMU foo";"PCMU bar", fmtp:"G729 foobar",... 
   
  One example use of the media format LCO is in conjunction with the 
  codec "telephone-event" as defined in RFC 2833 [14]. If the codec 
  "telephone-event" is used without the "fmtp" media format parameter, 
  the DTMF digits (telephone events 0-15 from RFC 2833) are assumed - 
  such practice is however discouraged. On the other hand, the media 
  format LCO MAY be used to specify the exact set of events that are 
  being requested via RFC 2833. Example: 
   
      L: a:PCMU;telephone-event,fmtp:"telephone-event 16" 
   
  indicates that if telephone events are supported at all, then this 
  request is specifically for event 16. 
   
  In another case, the Call Agent may indicate that some format 
  parameters are "required" while others are optional. In the example 
  below telephone events 0-15 are a "must" while telephone events 16, 
  70 and 71 are optional. 
   
       L: a:PCMU;telephone-event, o-fmtp:"telephone-event 16,70,71",  
       fmtp:"telephone-event 0-15" 
   
  If the gateway cannot support telephone events 0-15, it MUST NOT 
  include the "telephone-event" codec in the SDP in its response. On 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 28] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

  the other hand, if it can support those telephone events, it SHOULD 
  indicate support for those events as well as any of the events 16, 70 
  and 71 that it supports. 
   
  If a request is made to audit the capabilities of an endpoint and the 
  endpoint supports the "telephone event" codec with events "0-16", 
  then the audit would include the following: 
   
      A: a:telephone-event, fmtp: "telephone-event 0-16" 
   
  Another example is the use of redundancy with RFC 2198 [9]. Again, 
  the format of the fmtp string is similar to that used in the SDP 
  except the codec rather than the payload type is used: 
   
     L: a:G729;pcmu;red,fmtp:"red pcmu/g729" 
   
  The corresponding media description in the SDP as part of the 
  connection request acknowledgment might look like: 
   
     m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 98 18 0 
     a=rtpmap:98 red/8000/1 
     a=fmtp:98 0/18 
   
  If we combine both telephone events and redundancy, an example local 
  connection option might look as follows: 
   
     L: a:G729;pcmu;red;telephone-event,fmtp:"red pcmu/g729", fmtp: 
     "telephone-event 16" 
   
  Note that we again specify the literal string for the encoding method 
  rather than it's payload type. This is a general principle that 
  should be used with this LocalConnectionOption.  
   
  The corresponding SDP might appear as follows: 
   
     m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 97 98 18 0 
     a=rtpmap:97 red/8000/1 
     a=fmtp:97 0/18 
     a=rtpmap:98 telephone event 
     a=fmtp:98 16 
   
  Note that normally local connection options that are associated with 
  a package should have the package prefix included as per the package 
  extension rules in [1]. The "fmtp" and "o-fmtp" LCO in the "FM" 
  package are an exception. The package prefix is not included in the 
  case of the "fmtp" and "o-fmtp" local connection options because they 
  were created before the extension rules in [1] were defined. 
   
  These two LocalConnectionOptions will consequently be registered with 
  IANA.

  These events all refer to RTP streams (connections), i.e. they cannot 
  be detected on an endpoint. Signals requested ("co1" and "co2") must 
  indicate the connection ID (e.g. "S: r/co1@connectionID"). An event 
  may be requested for all existing connections using the "*" wildcard 
  for the connectionID as described in [1]. 
   
  Example: 
       R: r/uc@*    (request to report uc on all connections) or 
   
       R: r/uc@connectionID   (request to report uc only on a specific  
       connection) 
   
  An event detected on a connection will include the connectionID, 
  e.g.: 
   
        O: r/uc@connectionID(15) 
 
   
  ICMP Unreachable Received (iu): 
     This event indicates that some number of ICMP unreachable packets 
     was received for this connection since an RQNT was received 
     requesting this event. This notification indicates that packets 
     that were sent by the gateway on this connection either did not 
     arrive at their destination or were not accepted (e.g. the port

     was closed). When this event is requested, a single parameter with 
     a decimal number from 1 to 255 may be included to indicate the 
     number of ICMP un-reachable packets that must occur before the 
     event is notified. If no parameter is supplied, with the request 
     then a default value of 3 is assumed. This is a one-shot event in 
     that once the event occurs, a further request is required in order 
     to re-initiate counting. 
      
     The observed event is parameterized with two parameters: 
      
     * The first parameter is the number of ICMP unreachable packets 
       received (i.e. the same value that was included in the request - 
       or the value 3, if the requested event was not parameterized) 
     * The second parameter is the error code indicated in the ICMP 
       unreachable packet, e.g.: 
   
        0 = net unreachable; 
   
        1 = host unreachable; 
   
        2 = protocol unreachable; 
   
        3 = port unreachable; 
   
        4 = fragmentation needed and DF set; 
   
        5 = source route failed. 
         
        etc. 
           
  An example of a request might be as follows: 
   
      RQNT 2001 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0 
      X: 0123456789B0 
      R: r/iu@364823(N)(5) 
   
  In this case a notify will occur if 5 ICMP port unreachable packets 
  are received as a result of RTP and/or RTCP packets being sent from 
  this gateway on the connection with connection ID 364823. 
   
  The resulting NTFY with observed events might be as follows: 
   
      NTFY 3002 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0 
      X: 0123456789B0 
      O: r/iu@364823(5,3) 
       
  The first parameter indicates 5 ICMP unreachable packets were 
  received since the RQNT with this request was sent. The second 
  parameter ("3") specifies the reason, which in this case is "port 
  unreachable".

  RTP/RTCP Timeout (rto): 
     
     This event indicates that neither RTP nor RTCP packets have been 
     received on this connection for a period of time equal to the 
     timeout value (in seconds). The timeout value is supplied as a 
     decimal number from 1 to 65535 in the parameter when the request 
     is made. The parameter is also supplied in ObservedEvents when the 
     event is reported - it then simply repeats the value supplied 
     originally. If an RTP or RTCP packet is received before the timer 
     expires, then the timer is reset and re-started. The event will 
     only be generated if the timer expires without an RTP or RTCP 
     packet arriving on the specified connection during the specified 
     period of time. Note that if the event is requested without a 
     parameter then a default timeout of 60 seconds is assumed. This is 
     a one-shot event in that once the event occurs, a further request 
     is required in order to re-initialize the timer. 
      
      
  An example of a request might be as follows: 
   
      RQNT 2001 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0 
      X: 0123456789B0 
      R: r/rto@364823(N)(120) 
   
  In this case a notify will occur if there is a period of time when no 
  RTP or RTCP packets have been received on connection 364823 for 120 
  seconds. 
   
  The resulting NTFY with observed events would be as follows: 
   
      NTFY 3002 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0 
      X: 0123456789B0 
      O: r/rto@364823(120) 
      
   
  Used Codec Changed (uc): 
     This event is only included here to maintain compatibility with 
     the previous version of this package. This event is requested 
     without a parameter but when reported, the hexadecimal payload 
     type is enclosed in parenthesis, as in UC(8), to indicate the 
     codec was changed to PCM A-law. Codec Numbers are specified in RFC 
     1890, or in a new definition of the audio profiles for RTP that 
     replaces this RFC.  
      
  Sampling Rate Changed (sr): 
     This event is only included here to maintain compatibility with 
     the previous version of this package. This event was meant to 
     indicate that the packetization period changed to some decimal 
     number in milliseconds enclosed in parenthesis, as in SR(20), 
     which would indicate that the sampling rate was changed to 20 
     milliseconds. Some implementations of media gateways may not allow 
     the sampling rate to be changed upon command from a call agent.

  Jitter Buffer Size Changed (ji): 
     This event is only included here to maintain compatibility with 
     the previous version of this package. This event is used to 
     indicate that the gateway has made an adjustment to the depth of 
     the jitter buffer. The syntax for requesting notification is "ji", 
     which tells the media gateway that the controller wants 
     notification of any jitter buffer size changes. The syntax for 
     notification from the media gateway to the controller is 
     "JI(####)", where the #### is a decimal number from 1 to 65536 
     indicating the new size of the jitter buffer, in milliseconds. 
      
   Packet Loss Exceeded (pl): 
     Packet loss rate exceeds the threshold of the specified decimal 
     number (with a range of 1 to 100,000) of packets per 100,000 
     packets, where the packet loss number is indicated in parenthesis. 
     For example, PL(10) is a drop rate of 10 in 100,000 packets. This 
     event is requested with a parameter indicating what packet loss 
     rate the Call Agent wishes to be reported. If the packet loss 
     exceeds that value, the event is reported with that same 
     parameter. The event is only reported once when the packet loss 
     threshold is exceeded. Once reported, a following request will re-
     initiate packet loss measurements and report when the threshold is 
     exceeded again. 
 
   Quality alert (qa): 
     The packet loss rate or the combination of delay and jitter 
     exceeded a quality threshold. The quality thresholds for delay, 
     jitter and packet loss rate are provisioned values. 
 
  Continuity tones (co1 and co2):  
     These are the same as those defined in the Trunk package, except 
     in this case they are only played over a network connection and 
     the connectionID MUST be supplied (e.g. "s: r/co1@connectionID"). 
     They can be used in conjunction with the Network LoopBack 
     (netwloop) or Network Continuity Test (netwtest) modes to test the 
     continuity of an RTP circuit. However, in the case of testing IP 
     continuity, a one tone test is sufficient i.e. generating and 
     detecting "co1" at one end with connection mode in network 
     loopback mode at the other end. Note that the test can also be 
     done using telephone events rather than tones, i.e. event 167 in 
     RFC 2833 corresponds to "co1". In this case, connection requests 
     are made with local connection options such as: 
   
       L: a:PCMU;telephone-event,fmtp:"telephone-event 167" 
   
     in order to request support for telephone event 167. If both ends 
     support the event, then the loopback proceeds as usual except that 
     telephone events corresponding to the co1 tone are sent rather 
     than the co1 tone itself. 
   
  Operation complete (oc):  
     This is the standard definition of operation complete. 
   
  Operation failure (of):

2.11.  Resource Reservation Package 
 
  Package Name: RES 
  Version: 0 
   
2.11.1. Description 
 
  The "RES" package provides local connection option support for 
  resource reservations as well as an event to indicate reservation 
  loss. 
   
  A number of LocalConnectionOption parameters are used in doing 
  resource reservations: "reservation request", "reservation 
  direction", "reservation confirmation" and "resource sharing". 
   
  Reservation Request LocalConnectionOption: The gateways can be 
  instructed to perform a reservation, for example using RSVP, on a 
  given connection. When a reservation is needed, the Call Agent will 
  specify the reservation profile that should be used, which is either 
  "controlled load" or "guaranteed service". The absence of reservation 
  can be indicated by asking for the "best effort" service, which is 
  the default value for this parameter.  
   
  Whether or not RSVP will be done is dependent on whether the 
  reservation request LocalConnectionOption parameter has been included 
  in a connection request for this connection (with either "controlled 
  load" or "guaranteed service" indicated). If a modify connection 
  (MDCX) request requires a change in the reservation and the 
  "reservation request" parameter is not included in the 
  LocalConnectionOptions but was included in the LocalConnectionOptions 
  for a previous connection request for that connection, then 
  "reservation request" value defaults to its previously saved value 
  for that connection. If a modify connection (MDCX) request explicitly 
  contains a "reservation request", indicating a request for "best 
  effort" for a connection that has an existing reservation, the 
  existing reservation will be torn down. 
   
  Reservation Direction LocalConnectionOption: When reservation has 
  been requested on a connection, the gateway will examine the 
  reservation direction LocalConnectionOption parameter to determine 
  the direction that reservations are required and do the following: 
      
   *  start emitting RSVP "PATH" messages if the reservation direction 
     LocalConnectionOptions parameter specified "send-only" or "send-
     receive". 
      
   *  start emitting RSVP "RESV" messages as soon as it receives "PATH" 
     messages if the reservation direction parameter specified 
     "receive-only" or "send-receive".  
      

 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 34] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

     If an RSVP reservation is requested but the reservation direction 
     LocalConnectionOption parameter is missing, the reservation 
     direction defaults to the previously saved value of the 
     reservation direction parameter for that connection. If there was 
     no previous reservation direction parameter for that connection, 
     the value is deduced from the connection mode. That is: 
      
      * start emitting RSVP "PATH" messages if the connection is in 
        "send-only", "send-receive", "conference", "network loop back" 
        or "network continuity test" mode (if a remote connection 
        descriptor has been received,) 
   
      * start emitting RSVP "RESV" messages as soon as it receives 
        "PATH"  messages if the connection is in "receive-only", "send-
        receive",  "conference", "network loop back" or "network 
        continuity test" mode. 
   
  Reservation Confirmation LocalConnectionOption: Another 
  LocalConnectionOption parameter for RSVP reservations is the 
  reservation confirmation parameter, which determines what the 
  resource reservation pre-condition is for acknowledging a successful 
  connection request: 
      
   *  If the reservation confirmation parameter is set to "none", the 
     gateway will "Ack" the connection request without waiting for 
     reservation completion. This is the default behavior. 
      
   *  If the "reservation confirmation" parameter is set to "send-only", 
     the gateway will "Ack" when the RESV is received to indicate 
     reservation in the send direction. 
      
   *  If the "reservation confirmation" parameter is set to "receive-
     only", the gateway will "Ack" when reservation confirm has been 
     received. 
      
   *  If the reservation confirmation parameter is set to "send-
     receive", the gateway will "Ack" only after RESV has been received 
     for send direction and reservation confirm has been received for 
     the receive direction. 
      
      
  Note that: 
        
     Values "receive-only" and "send-receive" are triggers for the 
     gateway to request reservation confirm when it sends out the RESV. 
      
     Pre-conditions should only be added for the direction(s) for which 
     resource reservations have been requested. If a direction is added 
     as a precondition and that direction was not requested in the 
     resource reservation, the direction is simply ignored as a pre-
     condition. 
      
     In this approach, resource reservation success is the pre-
     condition to final acknowledgement of the connection request. If 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 35] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

     the reservation fails, the connection request also fails (error 
     code 526 - insufficient bandwidth) - as will any other part of the 
     transaction, e.g. a notification request included as part of the 
     connection request. A typical example of this would be a request 
     to ring the phone and look for off-hook, included with the 
     connection request. If the reservation fails, the phone will not 
     ring. Similarly, if the phone is already off-hook, the command 
     fails and there will be no resource reservation. 
      
     A provisional response SHOULD be provided if confirmation is 
     expected to occur outside the normal retry timers and in fact a 
     provisional response MUST be provided regardless if reservation 
     confirmation parameter has value "send-receive" (without a 
     provisional response, SDP information cannot be returned until the 
     final "Ack" which will not occur until the reservation is 
     complete. This results in a deadlock since the SDP information 
     typically needs to be passed to the other end in order for it to 
     initiate the RSVP PATH in the other direction). The SDP 
     information and connectionID MUST be included in both the 
     provisional response and the final response. Note that in order to 
     ensure rapid detection of a lost final response, final responses 
     issued after provisional responses for a transaction shall be 
     acknowledged, i.e., they shall include an empty "ResponseAck" 
     parameter in the final response (see [1]). 
      
     If the transaction time is outside the expected bounds (time T-
     HIST - see the section on provisional responses in [1]), error 
     code 406 (transaction timeout) should be returned. 
      
     Also note that if the reservation confirmation parameter is 
     omitted, the value of the reservation confirmation parameter 
     defaults to its previously-saved value. If there is no previously 
     saved value for the reservation confirmation parameter or the 
     reservation confirmation parameter has the value "none", then 
     successful resource reservation is not a pre-condition to 
     providing an acknowledgement to the connection request (i.e. the 
     gateway can "Ack" right away without waiting for the reservation 
     to complete and a provisional response will not be necessary). 
      
      
  Resource Sharing LocalConnectionOption: It may be possible to share 
  network resources across multiple connections. An example is a call-
  waiting scenario, where only one connection will ever be active at a 
  time. In a 3-way calling scenario with a similar set of connections, 
  sharing is not possible. Only the Call Agent knows what may be 
  possible, depending on the feature that is being invoked. 
      
     In order to allow the Call Agent to indicate that sharing is 
     possible, a resource sharing LocalConnectionOption parameter is 
     introduced. This parameter can have one of the following values: 
      
      * A value "$" can be specified where $ refers to "this 
        connection". This value is used when doing a create connection 
        and indicates the intent to share resources with this 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 36] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

        connection. This is an indication to the gateway to use the 
        shared explicit style of reservation as defined in RFC 2205. 
      
      * A connection ID can be specified which indicates that this is a 
        request to share resources with the connection having this 
        connection ID (allowing multiple connections to share resources 
        with the connection indicated)  
      
      * The value can be empty, which indicates a request to no longer 
        share the resources of this connection with other connections 
   
  In the case of a CRCX the default value for the resource sharing 
  local connection option is empty and for an MDCX the default value is 
  its current value. 
   
  The RSVP filters will be deduced from the characteristics of the 
  connection. The RSVP resource profiles will be deduced from the 
  connection's bandwidth and packetization period. 
   
  Note that if RSVP is used with dynamic quality of service [17], then 
  the parameters in NCS [18] would be used instead of the reservation 
  direction, confirmation and reservation sharing parameters described 
  here. 
 
   
2.11.2. Parameter Encoding 
   
  The Local Connection Options for the "RES" package consist of the 
  following: 
   
   *  The resource reservation parameter, encoded as the keyword "r", 
     followed by a colon and the value "g" (guaranteed service), "cl" 
     (controlled load) or "be" (best effort). 
   
   *  The reservation direction parameter, encoded as the keyword  
     "r-dir" followed by a colon and the value "sendonly", "recvonly" 
     or "sendrecv". 
   
   *  The reservation confirmation parameter, encoded as the keyword  
     "r-cnf" followed by a colon and the value "none", "sendonly", 
     "recvonly" or "sendrecv". 
   
   *  The resource sharing parameter, encoded as the keyword "r-sh" 
     followed by a colon and either: 
   
      * the wild-card character "$" indicating this connection, 
        indicating future plans to share resources with this connection 
        (i.e. indicating that a shared explicit style of reservation 
        should be used - see RFC 2205), or 
      
      * a connection ID, indicating a request to share resources with 
        the connection having the specified connection ID (and all 
        other connections sharing resources with that connection), or 
      
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 37] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

      * an empty value (i.e. "r-sh:" with no value indicated), 
        indicating a request to no longer share the resources of this 
        connection with other connections 
   
  Note that normally local connection options that are associated with 
  a package should have the package prefix included as per the package 
  extension rules in [1]. The local connection options in the "RES" 
  package are exceptions. The package prefix is not included in the 
  case of the "RES" package because it was created before the extension 
  rules in [1] were defined. 
   
2.11.3 Events 
 
  The following event is included as part of the resource reservation 
  package: 
 
    ------------------------------------------------------ 
   | Symbol  | Definition           |   R |   S  Duration | 
   |------------------------------------------------------| 
   |  rl     | Resource Lost        |   C |               | 
    ------------------------------------------------------ 
 
  Resource Lost: 
     Loss of reservation during the life of a connection can be 
     reported by using the rl event. If requested on an endpoint 
     (without specifying the connection ID), the request refers to all 
     present and future connections on that endpoint. When reported, 
     the connectionID is always supplied, as in: 
      
          O: res/rl@0A3F58 
   
     Resource lost will also occur if a resource reservation is in 
     progress when the event is requested, and the reservation fails. 
   
 
2.12.  Announcement Server Package 
 
   Package Name: A 
   Version: 1 
 
    ------------------------------------------------------------- 
   | Symbol         | Definition           |   R |   S  Duration | 
   |-------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | ann(url)       | Play an announcement |     |   TO variable | 
   | oc             | operation complete   |   x |               | 
   | of             | operation failure    |   x |               | 
    ------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  Changes from the previous version: change to conform to standard 
  reporting of operation failure and operation complete events. 
   
  The announcement action is qualified by a URL name: 
 
      S: ann(http://scripts.example.net/all-lines-busy.au) 
 
Arango et al.                Informational                    [Page 38] 

                    Basic MGCP Packages                   February 2002 

 
  The URL name MAY be followed by a list of initial parameters, 
  separated by commas. However, standard parameters are not included as 
  part of this package definition (Note: use of additional parameters 
  is optional and would result in a proprietary interface). 
   
  The gateway SHOULD support one or more standard URL schemes such as: 
   
     * file, http, ftp (RFC 1738), which indicate where the audio file 
       is located (where to load the file from before playing the audio 
       file on the gateway). 
   
     * RTSP URL (section 3.2 of RFC 2326), which in this case allows 
       the media gateway to directly initiate playing of the 
       announcement via an RTSP server. 
   
  The pre-condition for a successful response (return code of "200") is 
  correct syntax and capability (support is available for this 
  request). Standard MGCP return codes apply in the case of failure. 
  Further indications of failure are provided in the operation fail 
  event. 
   
  If the announcement cannot be played out for a reason determined 
  after a successful response to the request as been provided, an 
  operation failure event will be returned. The failure MAY be 
  explained by a commentary, as in: 
 
     O: a/of(a/ann(file not found)) 
   
  The "operation complete" event will be detected when the announcement 
  is played out. 
   
    O: a/oc(a/ann)

2.13.  Script Package 
 
  Package Name: Script 
  Version: 1 
 
   ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
  | Symbol       |   Definition              | R |  S  |   Duration | 
  |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
  | java(url,...) | Load & Run java script   |   |  TO |   variable | 
  | perl(url,...) | Load & Run perl script   |   |  TO |   variable | 
  | tcl(url,...)  | Load & Run TCL script    |   |  TO |   variable | 
  | xml(url,...)  | Load & Run XML script    |   |  TO |   variable | 
  | vxml(url,...) | Load & Run VXML doc.     |   |  TO |   variable | 
  | ir(..)        | Intermediate Results/Req.| x |  BR |            | 
  | oc            | operation complete       | x |     |            | 
  | of            | operation failure        | x |     |            | 
   ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  Changes from the previous version of the package: "vxml" was added as 
  a language type for loading and running VXML documents; change to 
  conform with standard reporting of operation failure and operation 
  complete events; addition of "ir" event. 
   
  The current definition defines keywords for the most common 
  languages. More languages may be defined in later versions of this 
  package. 
   
  The "signal" specifying the scripting language is parameterized with 
  a URL indicating the location of the script. The URL parameter MAY be 
  optionally followed by a comma-separated list of arguments as initial 
  parameters to use in running the script. URL schemes may include file 
  ftp, or http schemes with syntax according to RFC 2396. As an 
  example: 
 
   S: script/vxml(ftp://ftp.example.net/credit-card.vxml,arg1,arg2,  
                                                             ...,argn) 
 
  The argument list "arg1,arg2,...,argn" is passed to the 
  script/document as a list of initial parameters. 
   
  The pre-condition for a successful response (return code of "200") is 
  correct syntax and capability (support is available for this 
  request). Standard MGCP return codes apply in the case of failure. 
  Some further (non-application/script specific) failure indications 
  are provided in the operation failure event. Example 
 
     O: script/of(script/vxml(file not found)) 
      
  The script produces an output, which consists of one or several text 
  strings, separated by commas. This provides the return-status of the 
  script as well as return parameters (if there are any). 
 
     O: script/oc(script/vxml(return-status=<status>,  
                                        name1=value1,name2=value2,...))

  where <status> can have one of the values "success" or "failure". 
  This is then followed by output parameters as a comma-separated list 
  of name-value pairs. 
   
  Intermediate Result/Request (ir(<params>)): This provides a way for: 
   
     * The script to inform the Call Agent of intermediate results 
       (e.g. a case where it is important because of timing concerns to 
       inform the Call Agent prior to operation complete). 
     * The script to request some information from the Call Agent. 
     * The Call Agent to inform the script of some event or information 
       that may be important for the operation of the script (in this 
       case "ir" is used as a signal). 
   
  Parameters (i.e. <params>) SHOULD be a comma-separated list of name-
  value pairs e.g. ir(name1=value1,name2=value2,..). The Call Agent MAY 
  include event parameters when it requests this event, in which case, 
  the MGCP syntax requirements require that the action be specified 
  (e.g. "R: ir(N)(nam1=value1,name2=value2,..)"). 
   
  If the Call Agent requests "ir" as a signal, at least one parameter 
  MUST be provided. When requesting the "ir" signal, the Call Agent 
  MUST also repeat the original script signal. This is in order to be 
  consistent with the semantics of TO signals in MGCP (i.e. if the 
  original "script" signal is not included, then the signal/script will 
  be stopped). 
 
3.0 Changes since draft-foster-mgcp-basic-packages-02.txt 
 
       * Minor change in description of "osi" signal in the line 
          package. 
       * "pst", "rgp", "rtp" signals added to SST package 
       * "sit" signal definition in the line package allows for 
          parameters (lines up with "sit" as defined in the trunk 
          package). 
       * Edits as per RFC 2119 ("SHOULD", "MUST" etc.) 
       * Addition to the definition of fax tone in the generic package 
          to line up with that in NCS [18]. 
       * Addition of the "ir" event to the script package.
