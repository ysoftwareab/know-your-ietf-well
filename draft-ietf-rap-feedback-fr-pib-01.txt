Abstract 
     Currently there are no policy classes defined for the PEP to convey 
     provisioned policy usage feedback to the PDP. The purpose of this 
     document is to define the policy usage feedback framework PIB that 
     specifies the policy classes common for COPS feedback reports. The 
     basic operation and objects for reporting usage information are 
     defined in [COPS]. A specific clientSI feedback object named REPORT 
     is defined in [COPS-PR]. A framework for approaching solicited and 
     periodic usage feedback is described in [COPS-FEED-FRWK.]This 
     document defines the policy classes for a feedback framework Policy 
     information base (PIB).

1 Introduction  
    
   The Framework of COPS-PR Usage Feedback describes the overall 
   approach to policy usage monitoring and reporting. This document 
   defines the specific Policy Information Base (PIB) framework for 
   policy usage feedback. The policy classes for monitoring and 
   reporting policy usage feedback as well as policy classes for 
   controlling reporting intervals, suspension, resumption and 
   solicitation are also defined. 
    
2 General Concepts  
     
2.1 Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies  
    
   There are three basic types of policy used to define what the PEP is 
   to monitor, record and report. These are the selection criteria 
   policy, the usage policy and the feedback report linkage policy.  
         
   The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP. It defines the 
   conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy. 
   Generally, the selection criterion is an existing PRC such as the 
   qosClfrElementEntry. This PRC is useful for specifying conditions on 
   which to base usage - i.e. count the number of packets received for 
   this classified flow.  
        
   The usage policy defines what attributes are monitored and recorded 
   by the PEP. These policies have an ACCESS clause of Report. 
   Generally, the usage policies specify counts related to a specific 
   action such as a packet being dropped. The feedback framework PIB 
   defines one usage policy class, frwkFeedbackTrafficUsage. It counts 
   packets and bytes. Usage PRCs may be generic, collecting basic 
   statistics, or they may be specific to a particular usage. The PDP 
   decides which PRC(s) best suit(s) its requirements. The PEP may 
   support only one usage PRC, in which case all statistics are gathered 
   using instances of that PRC. Alternatively, the PEP may support 
   multiple usage PRCs. The PDP then decides which PRC to associate with 
   a particular selection criterion.  
     
    
   A usage policy and selection policy are tightly associated with one 
   another. A third policy is used to associate, or link, the selection 
   and usage policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable performs this linking 
   of the selection and usage policies. The feedback report linkage 
   permits the same selection criteria instance to be re-used for 
   various usage policies. The feedback type report linkage references 
   the selection criteria instance as well as defines the policy class 
   of the usage PRC. As noted above, the selection criteria policy may 
   be used for enforcement policies as well as usage policies. This is 
   the case with qosClfrElementEntry.

                               Figure 1  
     
   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between a selection criteria, 
   linkage and usage policies.   
        
   The PDP is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage policy 
   when installing the selection criteria and feedback report linkage 
   policies. The usage policy is instantiated on the PEP by the 
   installation of a feedback report linkage and the PEP designates the 
   instance identifier. The usage policy class always contains an 
   attribute of type Prid which contains the value of the associated 
   feedback report linkage PRID [COPS-PR] installed by the PDP. Note 
   that the Prid type is a textual convention for an object identifier 
   that is the PRC of the table used for the feedback report linkage 
   (was - selection criteria) and where the last sub-identifier is an 
   instance ID of the feedback report linkage.   
      
    
2.2 Normal Operations 
 
2.2.1 Connection Establishment and Initial Configuration Request   
        
   The Accounting Timer object in the Connection Accept message contains 
   the minimum number of seconds between reporting intervals as 
   described in [COPS] and [COPS-FEEDBACK-FRWK.] This is used as the 
   basic unit of measurement in defining intervals for specific usage 
   policies with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute.  
    
   The PEP notifies the PDP of the selection criteria policy classes and 
   usage policy classes it supports during the initial request for 
   configuration data using the frwkPRCSupportTable entries [FR-PIB]. 
   The PEP also indicates whether it supports the frwkFeedbackLinkTable 
   as well. 
         
   The PDP responds to the initial request for configuration with a 
   DECISION that installs policies. The PDP may also specify maximum 
   reporting intervals associated with each of the usage policies. This 
   is done with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute in the 
   frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance. It may also specify reporting 
   thresholds by including an instance of a threshold class (e.g. 
   frwkFeedbackTrafficThresholdTable) in the decision. The PEP monitors 
   and records the usage per the conditions defined by its associated 
   selection criteria policy. Periodically the PEP reports the usage 
   with an feedback type REPORT or provides a REPORT when solicited by

Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB              November 2001 
 
 
   the PDP. The PDP solicits usage feedback with the 
   frwkFeedbackActionIndicator attribute of the frwkFeedbackActionTable.   
        
       
2.2.2 Unsolicited Reports - Periodic Reporting 
 
   Reporting may be periodic in nature and unsolicited. The intervals 
   at which the unsolicited reports are provided by the PEP are defined 
   in the specific Linkage policies. The defined intervals are based on 
   the number of seconds specified by the PDP in the ACCT Timer value. 
   The PDP may specify that the periodic unsolicited report is to only 
   occur if a threshold is reached and/or if the usage value has 
   changed from the previous reporting interval.  
    
   There are cases when the PEP must supply unsolicited feedback 
   reports that may not fall on an interval boundary. The PEP MUST 
   provide an unsolicited REPORT containing all defined usages 
   instances just prior to the PEP issuing a Delete Request State and 
   just prior to the PEP de-activating a PIB instance context. 
 
2.2.3 Unsolicited Reports - Reporting Conditions 
 
   Periodic unsolicited reports for individual linkage objects can be 
   suppressed by specifying additional conditions. Supported conditions 
   are: 
   ChangeOnly 
        If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackUsageLinkFlags field, 
        the associated usage instance is only included in a periodic 
        unsolicited report if its value changed since the last 
        unsolicited report.  
         
   Threshold 
        If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackUsageLinkFlags field, 
        the associated usage instance is only included in a periodic 
        unsolicited report, if the threshold condition referenced in 
        the frwkLinkThreshold field evaluates successfully for the 
        associated usage instance.  
         
   Both conditions can be combined in one frwkFeedbackLinkUsage object. 
   In this case both conditions need to succeed for the usage instance 
   to be reported. 
    
   Unsolicited reports triggered by a Delete Request State or the 
   deactivation of a PIB instance are not subject to these conditions - 
   all usage objects must be included in these cases.  
 
 
2.2.4 Solicited Reports 
    
   The PDP may solicit policy usage feedback by issuing an unsolicited 
   Decision containing the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to SOLICIT 
   USAGE REPORT NOW. The PEP is to provide a solicited REPORT feedback 
   containing usage feedback. The PEP shall continue to provide

Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB              November 2001 
 
 
   periodic feedback as well at the specified intervals established at 
   client connection acceptance. 
   The reporting conditions (ChangeOnly and Threshold) do not affect 
   solicited reports - all requested usage instances must be included. 
  
2.2.5 Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting    
               
   The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and tracking at the PEP with the 
   frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to SUSPEND USAGE MONITORING AND 
   REPORTS. The PEP must stop tracking usage information and must not 
   issue any feedback reports. The PDP may only suspend feedback 
   reporting by setting the ActionIndicator to SUSPEND REPORTS ONLY. The 
   PEP must cease sending unsolicited reports but is to continue 
   monitoring and tracking usage. The PDP may resume the sending of 
   feedback reports and may resume usage monitoring by setting the 
   ActionIndicator to RESUME USAGE AND REPORTING.  
    
   The PDP may suspend or resume for all usage instances or the PDP may 
   specify one or more instances that are to be suspended or resumed. 
   The frwkFeedbackActionList contains a tag identifier that references 
   a list of one or more frwkFeedbackActionListTable entries. 
    
   The PDP may halt usage monitoring, tracking and reporting of usage 
   policies by removing the associated Linkage entry.  
 
 
 2.2.6 Failover   
        
   In the event the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the PEP 
   continues to track usage information as long as it continues to 
   operate with the installed policy. When the locally installed policy 
   at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.  
        
   Upon successful reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy, 
   the PDP indicates to the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the 
   feedback type report messages. The PDP does this deterministically. 
   It issues an unsolicited decision containing the 
   frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator set to resume reporting. The PEP should 
   resume reporting at the next appropriate feedback interval 
   established upon the acceptance of the re-connection.  The PDP is 
   aware of the request state Handle(s) and the supported PRCs either 
   through the state synchronization mechanism or because the PDP 
   considers itself synchronized with the PEP upon reconnection.   
 
 
          
3 Summary of the Feedback Framework Policy Information Base  
     
3.1 SPPI ACCESS clause report-only    
           
   The selection criteria and linkage policy classes follow the 
   definitions specified by [SPPI]. This structure specifies well-
   defined policy classes and their instances residing in a common,

Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB              November 2001 
 
 
   virtual repository [FR-PIB]. The additional PIB-ACCESS clause 
   attribute of "report-only" denotes the usage policy class reported by 
   the PEP.  
    
    
3.2 Feedback Groups and PRCs  
           
   It is useful to define reporting intervals, and suspend, resume, and 
   solicit characteristics as well as the common usage and selection 
   criteria polices. These policy classes are common to account type 
   reporting for various technologies and apply to ALL SUBJECT-
   CATEGORIES. The policy classes are divided into three new groups, 
   namely, The Feedback Report Group, The Feedback Usage Group and The 
   Feedback Selection Group.  
    
   The policy classes in the Feedback Report Group are:  
        
      1) Feedback Action Table   
      2) Feedback Action List Table 
      3) Feedback Selection Usage Combination Capability Table 
      4) Feedback Linkage Table  
    
   The policy classes in the Feedback Usage Group are:  
      1) Feedback Traffic Statistics Usage Table 
      2) Feedback Interface Traffic Statistics Usage Table 
      3) Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold Table 
       
   The policy classes in the Feedback Selection Group are:  
      1) SetWatchPoint Table 
      2) Feedback DPE Selection Criteria Table 
      3) Feedback DPE Selection Query Table 
      4) Feedback DPE Interface Usage Table 
    
    
3.2.1 Feedback Action Table  
    
   The Feedback Action Table contains the attributes that specify 
   action that the PEP is to take regarding policy usage, monitoring 
   and tracking. The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and periodic 
   reporting, suspend periodic reporting only, resume usage and 
   periodic reporting or solicit immediate reporting. The action may 
   affect all feedback policies or be associated with one or more 
   policy instances. 
    
   The Feedback Action Indicator defines the action. The Feedback 
   Specific PRI indicates whether the action applies to all of the 
   usage policies or to a list. The Feedback List ID is the identifier 
   of the list of Linkage policy instances to which the action is to be 
   applied. 
    
   The PDP can solicit the PEP for immediate usage feedback. The PEP 
   shall respond with a solicited report containing the usage feedback.

Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB              November 2001 
 
 
   The PDP can direct the resumption of usage monitoring and reporting 
   per the defined intervals. For example, the PEP may have re-
   connected to a PDP and has cached usage policies. The PDP indicates 
   to the PEP to resume usage tracking and monitoring and to send all 
   the cached usage policy.  The PEP shall respond at the next 
   appropriate interval with an unsolicited report containing the usage 
   feedback. 
    
   The PDP can suspend the monitoring of usage policy. The PEP 
   maintains the current usage that has been monitored but discontinues 
   any further monitoring until the PDP directs the PEP to resume 
   monitoring in a subsequent Decision. 
    
   The PDP can also suspend just the reporting of usage, but not 
   interrupt the monitoring and tracking of usage. The PEP shall 
   discontinue sending Report messages with usage feedback until the 
   PDP directs the PEP to resume. The PEP then begins reporting the 
   usage feedback at the next interval. 
    
        
3.2.2 Feedback List Table 
 
   This table contains a list of PRIDs of the linkage table for which 
   the PDP wants feedback reports. The value is referenced by an 
   attribute in the Feedback Resume Table. There may be one or more 
   instances associated with a specific list identifier defined by the 
   Feedback Action List ID. 
    
3.2.3 The Feedback Selection Usage Combination Capability Table 
    
   This table defines the valid selection criteria PRC, and usage PRC 
   and threshold PRC combinations supported. 
    
3.2.4 The Feedback Report Linkage Table  
     
   This table links the selection criteria instance with the usage 
   instance. It specifies the PRID of the selection criteria and the PRC 
   of the usage instance. This table permits the reuse of a selection 
   criteria instance for multiple usage policies.   
     
   The linkage table also permits the definition of a maximum reporting 
   interval to use when issuing the feedback type reports for the usage 
   instance. This interval is defined in units of the Accounting Timer 
   Interval specified in the client accept message. A value of 0 in this 
   attribute indicates that the usage policy must be solicited. 
     
3.2.5 The Feedback Traffic Statistics Usage Table  
  
   This table describes the packet counts, byte counts, last timestamp 
   when a packet was received and the PRID of the associated Feedback 
   Report Linkage instance. The count and timestamp information is 
   monitored and recorded by the PEP and supplied to the PDP with the 
   feedback type report message within the maximum interval specified.

3.2.6 The Feedback Interface Traffic Statistics Usage Table  
 
   This table is similar to the table described above, except that it 
   includes an additional reference to an interface. This table should 
   be used with a selection criteria that matches an element that is 
   assigned to multiple interfaces. The interface field can be used to 
   associate the instances of this table with the specific element’s 
   assignment. 
    
3.2.7 The Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold Table 
    
   This table is used to provide threshold values for the attributes 
   described in the above usage tables.  
    
3.2.8 The SetWatchPoint Table 
    
   This table defines a selection criteria policy that identifies the 
   enforcement policy processing point at which the associated usage 
   policy is to be monitored. This is useful in the data path models 
   where re-use of the enforcement policy occurs and is implemented in 
   a linked fashion. For example, it may be useful to monitor and 
   feedback the packet usage at a specific dropper enforcement policy 
   in the DiffServ PIB.   
    
3.2.9 Feedback DPE Selection Criteria Table 
    
   This table is an example of a Selection Criteria PRC that references 
   a specific instance of a shared object.  
   It is based on the popular model of a data path consisting of 
   multiple linked data path elements (DPEs). 
   A single data path can be assigned to multiple interfaces by a 
   single entry in the Data Path Table [DIFFSERV-PIB], elements within 
   this data path however can collect usage information for each 
   assignment individually. 
    
   Instances of this class allow the PDP to select a specific 
   assignment of a data path element to be selected for usage 
   reporting. This is achieved by the combination of references to a 
   Data Path Entry, a Data Path Element and the Interface.  
   It is expected to be used in combination with the 
   FrwkFeedbackTrafficUsage PRC. 
      
3.2.10 Feedback DPE Selection Query Table 
    
   This Selection Criteria PRC is similar to the DPE Selection Criteria 
   Table, however it is missing the reference to a specific interface. 
   This means an instance of this class can select multiple assignments 
   of a data path element for usage collection. Each selected 
   assignment of the DPE creates its own usage instance. 
   This selection criteria PRC is expected to be used together with a 
   usage PRC that includes the a reference to an interface, so the 
   results can be assigned uniquely.

5 Security Considerations  
        
     The feedback information is sensitive and requires that authorized 
     messaging occur between the PEP and the PDP. This protection can 
     be accomplished with IPSEC between the PEP and the PDP or using 
     the security mechanisms described in the base COPS protocol.
