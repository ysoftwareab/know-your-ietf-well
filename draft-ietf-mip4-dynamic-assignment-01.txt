   Abstract 
    
        Mobile IP (RFC 3344) uses the Home Agent (HA) to anchor 
        sessions of a roaming Mobile Node (MN). This draft proposes a 
        messaging mechanism for dynamic home agent assignment and HA 
        redirection. The goal is to provide a mechanism to assign an 
        optimal HA for a Mobile IP session while allowing any suitable 
        method for HA selection.

   1. Introduction  
    
    
        This document adds to the Mobile IP protocol [1], by proposing 
        a messaging mechanism for dynamic home agent assignment and 
        home agent redirection during initial registration. The goal is 
        to assign an optimal HA for a Mobile IP session.  The mobile 
        node MUST use Network Access Identifier (NAI) extension for 
        home address assignment.

   Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment          28 April 2004 
               
 
        MN requests the network to dynamically assign an HA by setting 
        HA field to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR (defined in next section) in 
        initial Registration Request. If the request is accepted, the 
        HA field in successful Registration Reply contains the HA 
        address. The requested HA can suggest an alternate HA and if 
        so, the Registration Reply is rejected with a new error code 
        (REDIRECT-HA-REQ) and the alternate HA address is specified in 
        a new extension (Redirected HA extension). 
         
        If the RRQ is rejected with Redirected HA extension or if the 
        MN wishes to register at a specific HA, MN can put the HA 
        address in the Requested HA extension in Registration Request. 
        The HA address in Requested HA extension is a hint to the 
        network where the MN may be anchored. The HA field is set to 
        ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDRESS for dynamic HA assignment. 
         
        The messaging mechanism proposed here is generic and can be 
        used as a common foundation to facilitate dynamic HA assignment 
        using  any  suitable  method.  No  specific  method  is  either 
        mandated or suggested. The HA receiving Registration Request 
        may suggest an alternate HA (HA redirection) for a number of 
        reasons;  including  but  not  limited  to  HA  load-balancing, 
        geographical proximity, administrative policy etc. 
         
         
   2. Terminology 
    
        ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR: IP address 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255. An 
                          address  of  255.255.255.255  would  indicate 
                          assigning HA in home domain. An address of  
                          0.0.0.0 would mean MN just needs a dynamic  
                          HA, it does not care whether in home or 
                          visited domain. 
 
        Requested HA:     Destination IP address of Home Agent that the 
                          first Registration Request is sent to. Must 
                          be a unicast IP address. This address can be 
                          obtained as described in section 5.4.  
         
        Assigned HA:      If  registration  is  successful,  this  Home 
                          Agent  address  field  is  obtained  from 
                          successful Registration Reply. 

        Redirected HA:    If the registration is rejected with error 
                          code (REDIRECT-HA-REQ), the HA being referred 
                          to  is  specified  in  a  new  extension 
                          (Redirected HA extension).

   3. Problem Statement 
         
        Mobile IPv4 NAI Extension for IPv4 [2] introduced the concept 
        of identifying a MN by the NAI and enabling dynamic home 
        address  assignment.  When  the  home  address  is  dynamically 
        assigned,  it  is  desirable  to  discover  the  Home  Agent 
        dynamically or inform the MN about an optimal HA to use for a 
        multitude of reasons, such as: 
         
        - If the distance between the visited network and the home 
        network of the mobile node is large, the signaling delay for 
        these registrations may be long. In such a case the MN will be 
        anchored to its distant home agent, resulting in tunneled 
        traffic traveling a long distance between home agent and the 
        mobile node. When a Mobile IP session initiates, if the mobile 
        node can be assigned a home agent, which is close to the mobile 
        node, it can drastically reduce the latency between the home 
        agent and mobile node. 
    
        - Also, in a large scale Mobile IP deployment, it is cumbersome 
        to provision MNs with multiple HA addresses.  
         
        - It is desirable to achieve some form of load balancing 
        between multiple HAs in the network. Dynamic HA assignment 
        and/or HA redirection lets the network select the optimal HA 
        from among a set of HAs and thus achieve load balancing among a 
        group of HAs.

   Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment          28 April 2004 
               
 
        - Local administrative policies is yet another reason for 
        dynamic HA assignment/HA redirection during the start of a 
        Mobile IP session. 
         
        - The problem of discovering a Mobile node’s HA address is 
        acknowledged in the MIPv6 working group as part of [8]. 
    
   3.1 Scope 
    
        This specification assumes that the Mobile Node and Assigned 
        Home Agent are in the same administrative domain. The scenario 
        where the Mobile Node and its anchoring Assigned Home Agent are 
        in different administrative domain is beyond the scope of this 
        specification. 
         
        The draft introduces the terms Requested/Assigned/Redirected HA 
        (section 5.4). These terms are merely HA addresses and used 
        depending upon the direction of the registration request or 
        reply. The discovery of Requested/Assigned/Redirected HA can be 
        done by various means, which are network and/or deployment 
        specific    and    hence    this    discovery/assignment    of 
        Requested/Assigned/Redirected HA is kept outside the scope of 
        this specification. 
         
    
   3.2 Dynamic Home Agent Discovery in RFC 3344  
            
        Mobile IP RFC 3344 specifies the mechanism for discovering the 
        mobile node's home agent using subnet-directed broadcast IP 
        address in the home agent field of the Registration Request.  
        This mechanism was designed for mobile nodes with a static home 
        address and subnet prefix, anchored on fixed home network.  But 
        using subnet-directed broadcast as the destination IP address 
        of  the  Registration  Request,  it  is  unlikely  that  the 
        Registration Request will reach the home subnet because routers 
        will drop these packets by default. See CERT Advisory CA-1998-
        01 Smurf IP Denial-of-Service Attacks [3].  
         
         
   3.3 NAI usage and dynamic HA assignment 
         
         
        Mobile IPv4 NAI Extension for IPv4 [2] introduced the concept 
        of identifying a MN by the NAI and enabling dynamic home 
        address assignment. This document mandates that while using 
        dynamic HA assignment, MN MUST use NAI and obtain a home 
        address.  MN  can  still  suggest  a  static  home  address  in 
        Registration Request, but must take the address in Registration 
        Reply as the home address for the session. This reference to 
        obtaining home address using NAI is as per [2].

        The Dynamic HA extension, shown in figure 1, contains the 
        address of the HA. This is a generic extension and can be used 
        in Registration Request and Reply messages. It is a skippable 
        extension.

        and if so, the Registration Reply is rejected with a new error 
        code  (REDIRECT-HA-REQ)  and  the  alternate  HA  address  is 
        specified in this extension.

   4. Messaging mechanism for dynamic HA assignment/redirection 
            
   4.1 Messaging for dynamic HA assignment 
 
         
          1. MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
             Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  
           
             If the MN is aware of an HA address, it can add that 
             address in the Requested HA extension in Registration 
             Request. 
          2. The MN (if using collocated CoA) or FA (if using FA CoA) 
             sends the Registration Request to the "Requested HA".  
              
             If the Requested HA extension is present, Requested HA is 
             the HA address in this extension. 
          3. "Requested HA" is the home agent, which processes the 
             Registration Request in accordance with RFC 3344 and as 
             per  the  specification  in  this  document.  It  creates 
             mobility binding for successful Registration Request. It 
             also sends Registration Reply to the MN. 
          4. The MN obtains an "Assigned HA" address from the HA field 
             in the successful Registration Reply and uses it for the 
             remainder of the session.  
          5. Subsequent Registration Request messages for renewal are 
             sent to the Assigned HA. 
 
 
        Section 5.3.1 describes the Assigned HA in detail. Some ideas 
        on how to select the Requested HA are briefly covered in 
        section 6.

        with the help of a railroad diagram and description.

        1. MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
        Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR. Since MN is using FA CoA in this 
        example, it sends the Registration Request to the FA. The 
        Registration Request looks as follows: 
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
        |  MN    |    FA      |         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA |  
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
         
        If the MN is aware of an HA address, it can add that address in 
        the  Requested  HA  extension  in  Registration  Request.  That 
        extension is not shown above. 
         
          
        2. The FA sends the Registration Request to the Requested HA. 
        The Registration Request looks as follows: 
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
        |  FA    |Requested HA|         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA |  
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
         
        If MN had included the Requested HA extension, the Registration 
        Request is sent to the HA address in that extension.

        3. HA processes the Registration Request in accordance with RFC 
        3344 and the messaging defined in this document. HA creates 
        mobility  binding  for  successful  request.  HA  then  sends 
        Registration Reply to the FA, which looks as follows. The 
        Assigned  HA  address  corresponds  to  the  HA  receiving  and 
        processing the request (and is same as Requested HA, only the 
        name is changed for registration reply). 
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |

        |   HA   | Src IP     |         |                   |       | 
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
         
        4. The FA relays the Registration Reply to the MN, as follows.  
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
        |  FA    |    MN      |         |    Assigned HA    |FA CoA/|  
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
         
        5. The MN obtains Assigned HA address from the HA field in the 
        successful Registration Reply and uses it for the remainder of 
        the  session.  MN  sends  subsequent  Re-Registration  or  De-
        Registration Requests for the remaining session directly to the 
        Assigned HA. 
         
         
   4.2 Messaging for HA redirection 
         
    
          1. MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
             Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR. 
          2. The MN (if using collocated CoA) or FA (if using FA CoA) 
             sends the Registration Request to the "Requested HA". If 
             the MN is aware of an HA address, it can add that address 
             in the Requested HA extension in Registration Request. 
           
          3. When HA receives the Registration Request, if the HA field 
             is set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR, HA may reject the request 
             with Reply code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and suggest an alternate 
             HA. 
 
             HA may reject the Request for a number of reasons, which 
             are outside the scope of this specification. If the HA 
             rejects the Request, the HA field in the Reply is set to 
             this HAs address. The HA that is being referred to is 
             specified in Redirected HA extension. The presence of this 
             extension is mandatory when the reply code is set to 
             REDIRECT-HA-REQ. HA sends the Reply to the FA/MN 
          4. FA sends the Reply to the MN.

          5. If the error code is set to REDIRECT-HA-REQ, MN obtains 
             the HA address from Redirected HA extension and sends a 
             Registration Request to this HA.

           Figure 3: Example of Message flows for the specification 
         
    
        1. MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
        Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR address. Since MN is using FA CoA 
        in this example, it sends the Registration Request to the FA. 
        The Registration Request looks as follows: 
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
        |  MN    |    FA      |         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA | 
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
         
        If the MN is aware of an HA address, it can add that address in 
        the  Requested  HA  extension  in  Registration  Request.  That 
        extension is not shown above. 
          
        2. The FA sends the Registration Request to the Requested HA. 
        If Requested HA extension is present, Requested HA is the HA 
        address in this extension. The Registration Request looks as 
        follows: 
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
        |  FA    |Requested HA|         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA |

        3. HA processes the Registration Request in accordance with RFC 
        3344 and the messaging defined in this document. If the 
        registration   is   successful,   but   local   configuration/ 
        administrative policy etc. directs HA to refer the MN to 
        another HA, HA rejects the Request with error code REDIRECT-HA-
        REQ. HA fills in the address of the directed HA in the 
        Redirected HA extension. HA then sends Registration Reply 
        reject to the FA, which looks as follows: 
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |

        | Redirected HA extension ... 
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
         
        4. The FA relays the Registration Reply to the MN, as follows.  
         
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
        | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |

        +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
        | Redirected HA extension ... 
        +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
         
        5. If MN can authenticate the Reply, MN extracts the HA address 
        from Redirected HA extension and sends Registration Request to 
        this HA.  
         
         
   5. Mobility Agent Considerations for dynamic HA assignment 
    
        Following sections describe the behavior of each mobility agent 
        in detail. 
         
    
   5.1 Mobile Node Considerations     
    
        The mobile node MUST use NAI extension for home address 
        assignment when using the messaging mechanism in this document. 
        While dynamic HA assignment is in progress and MN has not 
        successfully anchored at a Home Agent, mobile node MUST set the 
        Home Agent field in the Registration Request to an ALL-ZERO-
        ONE-ADDR, which is either 255.255.255.255 or 0.0.0.0.  
 
        The  Registration  Request  MUST  be  protected  by  a  valid 
        authenticator as specified in [1] or [5]. Configuring security 
        associations is deployment specific and hence outside the scope 
        of this specification. The security associations between a MN

   Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment          28 April 2004 
               
 
        and an individual HA may also be dynamically derived during the 
        dynamic HA assignment, based on a shared secret between MN and 
        AAA infrastructure.  
         
        The mobile node must maintain the remaining Mobile IP session 
        with the Assigned HA. Following sections describe MN behavior 
        in FA CoA mode and collocated CoA mode. 
    
    
   5.1.1 MN using FA CoA 
         
        When a mobile node initiates Mobile IP session requesting 
        dynamic HA assignment, it MUST set the home agent address field 
        in  the  Registration  Request  to  ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  The 
        destination IP address of Registration Request is the FA. The 
        FA will determine the Requested HA and forward the Registration 
        Request to the Requested HA. Registration Request processing 
        takes place on the Requested HA as per the specification in 
        this draft. 
 
        The Registration Request MUST be appropriately authenticated 
        for the HA to validate the Request. 
         
        If  successful  Registration  Reply  is  received,  MN  obtains 
        Assigned HA from the HA field of Reply. 
         
        If Registration Reply is received with code REDIRECT-HA-REQ, MN 
        MUST authenticate the Reply based on HA address in HA field of 
        Reply and attempt Registration with the HA address specified in 
        the Redirected HA extension. In some cases, MN may want to hint 
        to the network to be anchored at a specific HA. In both these 
        cases, MN MUST put the HA address in the Requested HA extension 
        in Registration Request. 
 
         
   5.1.2 MN using Collocated CoA 
         
        Mobile  Node  in  collocated  CoA  mode  requesting  dynamic  HA 
        assignment MUST set the home agent address field in the 
        Registration Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR. The destination IP 
        address of the Registration Request is the Requested HA. Some 
        ideas to select a Requested HA are briefly covered in section 
        6.  
         
        If successful Reply is received, the MN obtains Assigned HA 
        address from successful Registration Reply. The MN MUST cache 
        the Assigned HA address for the length of the Mobile IP 
        session. The mobile node then MUST use this previously cached 
        Assigned HA address as the home agent address in subsequent re-
        registration and de-registration request(s). This will make 
        sure that the mobile node will always be anchored to the 
        assigned home agent with which it was initially registered.

   Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment          28 April 2004 
               
 
         
        If Registration Reply is received with code REDIRECT-HA-REQ, MN 
        MUST authenticate the Reply based on HA address in HA field of 
        Reply and attempt Registration with the HA address specified in 
        the Redirected HA extension. In some cases, MN may want to hint 
        to the network to be anchored at a specific HA. In both these 
        cases, MN MUST put the HA address in the Requested HA extension 
        in Registration Request. 
         
        While requesting dynamic HA assignment in collocated CoA mode, 
        Requested HA extension must always be included. 
         
   5.1.3 Refreshing Assigned HA Address on Mobile Node 
         
        When the Mobile IP session terminates, the mobile node MAY 
        clear the Assigned HA address cached as the home agent address. 
        It MAY request a new HA address for the new Mobile IP session 
        by not including the Requested HA extension. The advantage of 
        this approach is that the mobile node will be always anchored 
        to an optimal home agent from where it initiated Mobile IP 
        session.  
 
        Alternately, MN may save the Assigned HA address and use it in 
        the Requested HA extension along with ALL-ZERO-ONE HA address 
        in Registration Request. 
 
   5.2 Foreign Agent Considerations 
    
        When the mobile node is using foreign agent CoA, it sends the 
        Registration Request to the foreign agent. When the FA receives 
        a Registration Request with HA address field set to ALL-ZERO-
        ONE-ADDR, it obtains the Requested HA address to forward the 
        Registration Request. Some ideas to select a Requested HA are 
        briefly covered in section 6. 
         
        If  the  FA  cannot  obtain  the  Requested  HA  to  forward  a 
        Registration Request from MN, it MUST reject request with error 
        code NONZERO-HA-REQD. 
         
        If the MN has included the Requested HA extension, FA MUST 
        forward Registration Request to the address in this extension. 
        If the HA address in this extension is not a routable unicast 
        address, FA MUST reject request with error code NONZERO-HA-
        REQD. 
         
        Backward compatibility issues related to the mobility agents 
        are addressed in section 9. 
    
    
   5.3 Home Agent Considerations

        Home Agent can process an incoming Registration Request in one 
        of the following three ways: 
         
        MN or FA sends the Registration Request to the Requested HA. 
        The  term  Requested  HA  has  meaning  in  context  of  the 
        Registration   Request   message.   When   the   Requested   HA 
        successfully  processes  Registration  Request  and  creates  a 
        binding and sends a Reply with its address, it becomes the 
        Assigned HA. The term Assigned HA is meaningful in context of a 
        Registration Reply message.  
         
        Home Agent receiving the request with HA field set to ALL-ZERO-
        ONE-ADDR  MAY  reject  the  request  even  if  successfully 
        authenticated  for  a  multitude  of  reasons  and  suggest  an 
        alternate HA address in Reply. In such a case, the HA puts its 
        own address in HA field of Reply and sets the Reply code to 
        REDIRECT-HA-REQ and adds the Redirected HA extension. 
         
        If  the  Registration  Request  contains  the  Requested  HA 
        extension, the HA address in that extension must match the 
        destination IP of the Request. 
         
   5.3.1 Assigned Home Agent Considerations  
    
        The HA that processes the incoming Registration Request fully 
        in accordance with RFC 3344 and this specification becomes the 
        Assigned  HA.  The  Registration  Request  terminates  at  the 
        Assigned HA.  
         
        The  Assigned  HA  creates  mobility  bindings  and  sends 
        Registration Reply to the MN by copying its address in the home 
        agent field and as the source IP address of the Reply. 
 
        There are two IP addresses to consider, destination IP address 
        and Home Agent address field in the Registration Request.  When 
        destination IP address is unicast, only one HA receives the 
        Registration Request.  This HA should unambiguously accept or 
        deny the registration, regardless of the value in the Home 
        Agent field.  When the Home Agent field is non-unicast, the HA 
        should set the value to its own IP address in the Registration 
        Reply.   
         
        The following table summarizes the behavior of Assigned HA.

                                       136 and sets HA field to its 
                                       own IP address in the reply as

                                       per section 3.8.3.2. 
                                        
                          ALL-ZERO-    New Behavior: Accept the RRQ as 
                          ONE-ADDR     per     this     specification. 
                                        Authenticate the RRQ and create 
                                        mobility binding if the HA is 
                                        acting as Assigned HA. Set HA 
                                        field to its own IP address in 
                                        the Registration Reply. 
                                         
                                                   OR 
                                         
                                        New    Behavior:    Dest    IP 
                                        corresponds to the HA receiving 
                                        RRQ,   if   authentication   is 
                                        successful, reject RRQ with a 
                                        new  error  code  (REDIRECT-HA-
                                        REQ). HA puts its address in HA 
                                        address  field  of  Reject.  HA 
                                        suggests an alternate HA to use 
                                        in  the  new  Redirected  HA 
                                        extension 
                                         
         
         
        Table 1: Registration Request handling at Assigned HA 
         
 
        This  specification  also  proposes  a  subtle  difference  in 
        behavior for case #1 above from RFC 3344.  As per the messaging 
        proposed here, the mobile node (or the foreign agent) sends the 
        Registration Request to the Requested HA address, which is a 
        unicast address. Because HA does not receive Registration 
        Request that is sent to the subnet-directed broadcast address, 
        RFC 3344 section 3.8.2.1 doesn't apply.  Although the Home 
        Agent field in the Registration Request is not a unicast 
        address, the destination IP address is a unicast address.  This 
        avoids the problem associated with subnet-directed broadcast 
        destination  IP  address  that  may  result  in  multiple  HAs 
        responding.  Thus, there is no need to deny the registration as 
        stated in RFC 3344 section 3.8.3.2. 
 
        When the destination IP address is a unicast address and Home 
        Agent  field  is  ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR,  the  HA  accepts/denies 
        registration and sets HA field to its own IP address in the 
        reply (i.e. registration is not rejected with error code 136).   
        HA can reject the request with the error code REDIRECT-HA-REQ 
        and suggest an alternate HA. This redirection can be used for 
        load-balancing, geographical proximity based on care-of-address 
        or a multitude of reasons. HA puts its own address in HA field 
        on Registration Reply message and put the address of the

        redirected HA in the Redirected HA extension. If HA accepts the 
        Request, HA field in Reply is set to this HA address. 
 
        The Assigned HA performs standard validity checks on the 
        Registration Request. If there is any error, the Registration 
        Request is rejected with error codes specified in RFC 3344. 
    
         
         
   6. Requested Home Agent Selection 
    
        The destination IP address of the Registration Request when 
        dynamic HA assignment is requested, is the Requested HA.  This 
        address MUST be a unicast IP address. If the MN has included a 
        Requested HA extension in Registration Request, the HA address 
        in this extension is the Requested HA. 
         
        Some ideas on how to select the Requested HA are briefly 
        covered in this section, however this draft neither suggests 
        nor mandates any specific mechanism. There can be more methods 
        for selecting the HA to the MN. Here is a high level overview 
        of some possibilities: 
         
        DHCP: 
         
        MN performs DHCP to obtain an IP address on the visited 
        network. The Requested HA is learned from the DHCP Mobile IP 
        Home  Agent  Option  68  [4].  MN  sends  Registration  Request 
        directly to this HA and receives the Assigned HA to be used for 
        the remainder of the Mobile IP session. 
         
         
        AAA: 
         
        MN  performs  challenge/response  [5]  with  the  FA.  The  FA 
        retrieves the Requested HA from the AAA server and forwards the 
        Registration Request directly to this HA.  The Assigned HA 
        sends Registration Reply to the FA, which relays it to the MN.  
        MN uses the Assigned HA for the remainder of the Mobile IP 
        session. 
         
         
        DNS: 
         
        In this case hostname of HA is configured on MN or obtained by 
        some other means – e.g. using a service location protocol. MN 
        performs DNS lookup on the HA hostname.  The DNS infrastructure 
        provides resource record with information to identify the 
        nearest HA to the MN.  The MN sends Registration Request 
        directly to the HA and receives the Assigned HA to be used for 
        remainder of the Mobile IP session.

        Static configuration: 
         
        HA address is statically configured on MN. The MN uses the 
        configured address to send the Registration Request. 
 
 
   7. Error Values 
    
        Each entry in the following table contains the name and value 
        for the error code to be returned in a Registration Reply. It 
        also includes the section in which the error code is first 
        mentioned in this document. 
         
        Error Name       Value  Section   Description 
        ----------       -----  -------   ----------------------------- 
        NONZERO-HA-REQD   XX     5.2     Non-zero HA address required 
                                          in Registration Request. 
        REDIRECT-HA-REQ   YY     5.3.1   Reregister with redirected HA. 
         
    
   8. IANA Considerations 
    
        The code value NONZERO-HA-REQD defined in Section 7, correspond 
        to error values conventionally associated with the rejection by 
        the foreign agent (i.e. value in the range 64-127). The code 
        value REDIRECT-HA-REQ defined in Section 7, correspond to error 
        values conventionally associated with the rejection by the home 
        agent (i.e. value in the range 128-192).  
         
        The Dynamic HA extension defined in section 3.4 corresponds to 
        a skippable extension.  
         
        IANA should record the values as defined in Section 7 and 3.4. 
         
         
   9. Security Considerations 
    
        This specification assumes that the Mobile Node and Assigned 
        Home  Agent  are  in  the  same  administrative  domain.  This 
        specification does not change or degrade the security model 
        established in RFC-3344. Most of the time Mobile Nodes will be 
        connected to the network via wireless link. Such links are 
        vulnerable to passive eavesdropping, replay attacks or many 
        other types of attacks. They are considered below.  
         
         
   9.1 Message Authentication Codes 
    
        The Registration Request and Registration Reply messages are 
        protected by a valid authenticator as specified in RFC 3344. 
        Configuring security associations is a deployment specific 
        issue and is covered by other specifications in Mobile IP WG.

   Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment          28 April 2004 
               
 
        There can be many ways of configuring security associations, 
        but this specification does not mandate any specific way.  
         
        An example is where the security association between a MN and 
        an individual HA (Dynamic or Assigned) is dynamically derived 
        during the dynamic HA assignment, based on a shared secret 
        between MN and AAA infrastructure, as defined in [7]. The 
        Registration Request is protected with MN-AAA authentication 
        extension and Registration Reply is protected with MHAE. Since 
        the security association is shared between MN and AAA, any 
        dynamically  assigned  HA  in  the  local  domain  can  proxy 
        authenticate the MN using AAA as per [7]. 
         
        The Assigned Home Agent authenticates Registration Request from 
        the mobile node as specified in RFC-3344 and RFC-3012. The MN 
        also authenticates the Registration Reply from the Assigned HA, 
        thus the existing trust model in RFC 3344 is maintained. 
         
                 
   9.2 Areas of Security Concern in this Protocol 
 
        As per the messaging in this draft, the Assigned Home Agent 
        will process the incoming Registration Request as per RFC-3344. 
        Hence the Assigned Home Agent will have same security concerns 
        as that of the Home Agent in RFC-3344. They are addressed in 
        Section 5 “Security Considerations” of RFC-3344. 
         
    
   10. Backward Compatibility Considerations 
    
         
        Legacy Home Agent:  
         
        Legacy home agents may reject the Registration Request with 
        error code 136 because the Home Agent field is not a unicast 
        address.  However,  some  legacy  HA  implementations  may 
        coincidentally process the Registration Request in accordance 
        with this draft, when the HA field in RRQ is set to ALL-ZERO-
        ONE-ADDR. 
         
        Legacy Foreign Agent: 
         
        Legacy foreign agents may forward Registration Request with 
        home agent field set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR by setting the 
        destination IP address to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  This will result 
        packet being dropped or incidentally handled by a next hop HA, 
        adjacent to the FA.   
         
        Legacy Mobile Node: 
         
        MN that does not set HA field to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR will 
        continue  to  achieve  its  registrations  through  statically

        configured HA. In collocated mode, the endpoint of the MN's 
        tunnel is the Assigned HA. 
    
    
   11. Change Log from previous version 
    
        1. Added subtype field in Redirected HA Address Extension.  
        2. Aligned the HA address at 4-byte world boundary.  
        3. The case of handling unicast HA field is removed in section 
        5.3.1. 
    
    
   12. Intellectual Property Rights 
    
        The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of 
        any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed 
        to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology 
        described in this document or the extent to which any license 
        under such rights might or might not be available; neither does 
        it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such
