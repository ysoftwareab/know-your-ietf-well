Abstract


   This document extends the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   described in RFC2327 for narrowband telephony applications that use
   AAL1 or AAL2. The list of extensions is meant to be exhaustive.
   Individual applications can use subsets of these extensions.

1. Introduction

   SDP will be used in conjunction with a media control protocol such
   as Megaco (draft-ietf-megaco-reqs-10.txt) or MGCP (RFC2705) to
   communicate the information needed to set-up narrowband telephony
   connections through an ATM fabric. These narrowband telephony
   connections include voice connections, voiceband data connections,
   clear channel circuit emulation connections and demodulated,
   baseband data connections for facsimile relay and modem relay.

   These extensions are meant to address the following narrowband
   telephony applications:


        * Applications in which a new SVC is set-up for each narrowband
          telephony connection. These SVCs could be AAL1 SVCs or
          single-CID AAL2 SVCs.
        * Applications in which existing PVC resources are assigned to
          narrowband telephony connections. These resources could be
          AAL1 PVCs, AAL2 single-CID PVCs or  channels within
          multiplexed AAL2 PVCs.

   Generally, the SDP session description will be constructed by an ATM
   network element such as a media gateway or an ATM or AAL2 switch and
   will be sent to a connection peer via a bearer-independent
   connection control  mechanism such as tunneling through an ISUP
   fabric. ATM network elements will used the SDP information to
   construct   bearer signaling messages   based on Q.2931 and
   Q.2630.1. These messages are used for ATM bearer connection
   establishment and the binding of an ATM bearer connection or channel
   to a telephony connection.

   It is also possible for the media gateway controller (call agent) to
   construct, modify or append to  the SDP session description.

2. Conventions used in this document

   This document uses all the syntactic conventions of standard SDP as
   defined in RFC2327.

   The SDP protocol (RFC2327)  requires that non-standard attributes
   and codec names use an "X-" prefix.

   In this internet draft, the "X-" prefix is used consistently for
   codec names (Table 1) that have not been registered with IANA.
   However, this prefix is not used for the extension SDP attributes
   defined in this document, since these are targeted for
   standardization.

   Since some  implementations might  not  use these  conventions,
   it is suggested that any parser/builder designed to this extensions



                                                                
	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 2]



   document should accept codec names and attribute names with or
   without the "X-" prefix.


3. Capabilities Provided by SDP extensions

   To support these applications, the SDP extensions in this document
   provide the following session establishment capabilities:

        * Identification by an ATM network element of its own address,
          in one of several possible formats. A connection peer can
          initiate SVC set-up to this address.


        * Identification of the ATM bearer connection that is to be
          bound to the narrowband telephony connection. This is either
          a VCC in AAL1 applications or a channel (identified by a CID)
          in AAL2 applications. This is useful in PVC applications.

        * In AAL1 applications, declaration of a set of payload types
          that can be bound to the ATM bearer connection.   RTP payload
          types that have been registered with IANA are re-used for
          AAL1. In the manner of standard SDP, unregistered payload
          types are mapped dynamically,

        * In AAL2 application, declaration of a set of profiles that
          can be bound to the ATM bearer connection. A mechanism for
          dynamically defining custom profiles within the SDP session
          description is included. This allows the use of custom
          profiles for connections that span multi-network interfaces.

        * A means of correlating narrowband telephony connections with
          underlying ATM bearer connections. The backbone network
          connection identifier or bnc-id specified in ITU Q.BICC
          standardization work is used for this purpose. In order to
          provide a common SDP base for applications based on
          ISUP+/Q.BICC and SIP/SIP+, the neutral term 'eecid' is used
          in lieu of 'bnc-id' in the SDP session descriptor.

        * A means of specifying the explicit mapping of one codec type
          and one packetization period into a service type.  Service
          types are voice, voiceband data and facsimile. This is useful
          in determining the encoding to use when the connection is
          upspeeded in response to modem or facsimile tones.

        * A means of describing the QoS class, traffic parameters and
          QoS parameters of the underlying ATM bearer connection.

4. Format of the ATM Session Description


   Session Descriptions for Narrowband Telephony over ATM contain the
   following lines:

   v=  (protocol version)
   o=  (origin)
   s=  (session name)
   c=  (connection information)
   t=  (timestamp)
   m=  (media information and transport address)
   a=  (media attribute)

   A session description for ATM-based narrowband telephony has exactly
   one of each of the following lines: 'v', 'o', 's', 'c', 't' and 'm'.
   These are mandatory per RFC2327. The 'a' line is optional. This line
   can be omitted. Also, there can be multiple 'a' lines in an ATM
   session description.

   The order of lines in an ATM session description is exactly as
   depicted above.

   The 'o', 's' and 't' lines are included for strict conformance with
   RFC2327. It is recognized that these lines do not carry useful
   information in some ATM-based narrowband telephony applications. For
   maximum interoperability, SDP parsers should not reject session
   descriptions that are without these lines.

   An ATM network element or call agent can propose several session
   descriptions, each of which  begins with a protocol version ('v')
   line. Each proposed session description is an alternate method of
   realizing the connection. These options are trimmed down as the
   connection establishment progresses.

5.  Structure of the Session Description Lines

5.1 The Origin Line

   The origin line for an ATM-based narrowband telephony session is
   structured as follows:

   o=<username> <session id> <version> <network type>
   <ATMaddressType> <ATMaddress>

   The <username> is set to '-'.

   The <session id> can be  set to one of the following:

      *   a Call ID, known from a signaling or control protocol.
      *   an NTP timestamp referring to the moment when the SDP session
        descriptor was created.

   The <version> refers to the version of the SDP session descriptor
   (not that of the SDP protocol). This is can be set to one of the
   following:

      *   '0'
      *   an NTP timestamp referring to the moment when the SDP session
        descriptor was modified. If the SDP session descriptor has not
        been modified by an intermediate entity (such as a call agent),
        then the <version> timestamp will be the same as the <session
        id> timestamp, if any.

   The <network type> in ATM-based narrowband telephony session
   descriptions can be one of the following: 'ATM', 'AAL1', 'AAL2' or
   'AAL5_FRF11'. The generic value 'ATM' is adequate since the
   adaptation type and higher-layer protocols are indicated elsewhere
   in the session description.

   The <ATMaddressType> and <ATMaddress>  parameters are identical to
   those for the connection information ('c') line. As with the 'c'
   line, these can be omitted where appropriate. Alternatively, each of
   these parameters can be set to a '-' when it is not particularly
   meaningful or necessary to specify the ATM address.

5.2 The Session Name Line


   In general, the session name line  is structured as follows:

        s=<session name>

   For ATM-based narrowband telephony sessions, the <session name>
   parameter is  either empty or is set to a   '-'.  The resulting
   lines are:

        s=


	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 5]




        s=-


5.3 The Connection Information Line

   The connection information line for ATM-based narrowband telephony
   sessions is structured as follows:

        c=ATM <ATMaddressType> <ATMaddress>

   The <ATM address>  refers to the local ATM address rather than the
   ATM address of the remote peer. See the description of the media
   information line below for a means of indicating the ATM address of
   the remote peer.

   The <ATMaddressType>  can be NSAP, E164 or GWID.

   The <ATMaddress>  format depends on the <ATMaddressType>.

   NSAP: If the ATMaddressType is NSAP, the ATMaddress is expressed as
   a string of 20 octets in dotted hex form. The last octet of the NSAP
   address is the 'selector' field that is not used for ATM addressing
   and is available for non-standard use. The prior six octets of the
   NSAP are an IEEE 802 MAC address assigned to the gateway. For
   example:

        c=ATM NSAP 47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00

   E164: If the ATMaddressType is E164, the ATMaddress is expressed as
   decimal numbers with up to 15 digits. For example:


        c=ATM E164 9738294382

   GWID: If the ATMaddressType is GWID meaning that the address is a
   private Voice Gateway identifier (unique within context of network),
   the ATMaddress is expressed as ASCII string ("A"-"Z", "a"-"z", "0"-
   "9",".","-","_"). For example:

        c=ATM GWID officeABCmgx101vism12

   The connection information line is always present in an SDP session
   descriptor. However, if there is no address to transmit, this line
   can be represented in one of the following equivalent ways:

        c=ATM
        c=ATM - -

   This might be used  when the address is known a priori.






	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 6]





5.4 The Timestamp Line


   The timestamp line for an SDP session descriptor is structured as
   follows:

        t= <start time> <stop time>

   For ATM-based narrowband telephony sessions, the  <start time>
   parameter can be made equal to the NTP timestamp (if any) used for
   the <session id> in the 'o' line.  It can also be set to 0
   indicating its irrelevance.

   The <stop time> parameter is set to 0 in the ATM-based narrowband
   telephony context.

5.5 Media Information Line for AAL1 sessions

   The media information line for AAL1-based narrowband telephony
   sessions   is structured as follows:

        m=audio <virtualConnectionId> AAL1/AVP <payload_type#1>
                <payload_type#2>...<payload_type #n>

   Note that it is not possible to make this line identical to the 'm'
   line in VoAAL2 due to basic differences between the two
   applications.

   The  <virtualConnectionId> parameter can be in  one of the following
   formats:

        * <vcci>
        * <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress>/<vcci>
        * <port_id>/<vpi>/<vci>

   where the number  of slashes and/or  the application context are
   used to differentiate between the various options. Within the SDP
   media information line, <vcci>, <port id>, <vpi> and <vci> are
   decimal numbers. The <ATMaddressType> and <ATMaddress> are identical
   to their definitions above for the connection information line with
   the difference that this address refers to the remote peer in the
   media information line.

   A '$' notation implies 'any'. A '$' can be used in lieu of <vcci>,
   <port id>, <vpi> , <vci>  or the entire virtualConnectionId
   parameter.

   Additionally, a '$' can be used in lieu of:
        * the hyphenated concatenation of the remote peer
          <ATMaddressType> and <ATMaddress>
        * the remote peer <ATMaddress> but not the <ATMaddressType> .



	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 7]





   There are contexts    such as SVC-based applications   where  there
   is no need to communicate the  <virtualConnectionId> parameter
   across the call agent - media gateway interface. In these contexts,
   it is sufficient to use a '$', '$/$' or '$/$/$' for the
   <virtualConnectionId> parameter.

   When the network uses PVCs the VCCI values are pre-provisioned. If
   connections are established via SVCs or S/PVCs, the VCCI is selected
   from the list of available VCCIs. The VCCI can  be signaled end-to-
   end within the Generic Information Transport (GIT) as part of the
   ITU Recommendation Q.2931 Setup message per ITU Recommendation
   Q.2941.2. Q.2941.2 proposes that bit 16 of a 16 bit VCCI  be  used
   to prevent glare in the allocation of VCCIs from either end. This
   Q.2941-based scheme is not adequate for preventing glare when a
   limited number of PVCs are dynamically assigned to narrowband
   telephony connections  on a call-by-call basis. For this dynamic PVC
   context, a mechanism for glare reduction such as assigning the
   lowest available values from different ends is needed.     

   The <port id> parameter is used to identify the physical trunk port
   on a stand-alone  gateway  or on a multiplexer into  which the
   gateway is plugged as a tributary module. The VPI and VCI have their
   usual ATM connotation.

   Although   RTP encapsulation defined in rfc1889    is not used, the
   payload type variables are used exactly as defined in rfc1890.
   Hence, the protocol used for Voice-over-AAL1 is identified as
   AAL1/AVP in the media information line.

   Following the text string 'AAL1/AVP', there is a    list of  payload
   types. The ordering of these payload types  (preferred codecs before
   less favored ones)  can indicate preference is some applications.
   These can be either statically assigned  or dynamically mapped
   payload types. Encodings that are not statically mapped to payload
   types by IANA  are to be dynamically mapped at the time of
   connection establishment to  payload types in the decimal  range 96-
   127. The SDP 'rtpmap' attribute (renamed 'atmmap') is used for this
   purpose.


   The following are examples of the use of the media information line
   in the descriptions of AAL1 narrowband telephony sessions.

   Example 1:
        m=audio 27 AAL1/AVP 18 0 96
        a=atmmap:96 G727-32

   implies that the AAL1 VCCI=27 and that the supported  encoding
   formats are G.729 (or G.729a), PCM Mu-law and 32 kbps G.727.

   Example 2:
        m=audio 3/4/50 AAL1/AVP 8 15


	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 8]
                                                               



   implies that the AAL1  virtual circuit used has VPI=4, VCI=50 and is
   on trunk port #3. Further, it implies that the encoding formats are
   G.711 A-law and G.728.


   Example 3:
        m=audio $  AAL1/AVP 8 15

   implies that any AAL1 VCC  may be used (subject to glare rules).

   Example 4:
        m=audio 2/6/$  AAL1/AVP 8 15

   implies that any VCI on VPI= 6 of trunk port #2 may be used.

5.6 Media Information Line for AAL2 sessions

   The media information line for AAL2-based narrowband telephony
   sessions   is structured as follows:

   m=audio <virtualConnectionId> <profileType #1> <profile #1>...
     <profile #n1> ... <profileType #M> <profile #1>...
     <profile #nM>

   In certain applications, the ordering  of profiles (preferred
   profiles before less favored ones) might imply a preference. In this
   case, the profiles associated with different profile types can be
   interspersed rather than grouped together as in the definition
   above.

   Note that it is not possible to make this line identical to the 'm'
   line in Voice-over-AAL1  due to basic differences between the two
   applications.

   The  <virtualConnectionId> parameter can be in  one of the following
   formats:

        * <vcci>/<cid>
        * <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress>/<vcci>/<cid>
        * <port id>/<vpi>/<vci>/<cid>
        * <bcg>/<vpi>/<vci>/<cid>
        * <bcg>/<vcci>/<cid>

   where the number  of slashes and/or  the application context are
   used to differentiate between the various options. Within the SDP
   media information line, <vcci>, <port id>, <bcg>, <vpi> , <vci> and
   <cid> are decimal numbers. The <ATMaddressType> and <ATMaddress> are
   identical to the definitions above for the connection information
   line with the difference that this address refers to the remote peer
   in the media information line.



	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 9]
                                                                





  A '$' notation implies 'any'. A '$' can be used in lieu of <vcci>,

  <port id>, <vpi> , <vci>, <cid>  or the entire virtualConnectionId

  parameter.

    Additionally, a '$' can be used in lieu of:
        * the hyphenated concatenation of the remote peer
          <ATMaddressType> and <ATMaddress>
        * the remote peer <ATMaddress> but not the <ATMaddressType>.

   There are contexts    such as SVC-based applications   where  there
   is no need to communicate the  <virtualConnectionId> parameter
   across the call agent - media gateway interface. In these contexts,
   it is sufficient to use a '$', '$/$', '$/$/$'  or '$/$/$/$' for the
   <virtualConnectionId> parameter.

   When the network uses PVCs the VCCI values are pre-provisioned. If
   connections are established via single-CID SVCs or S/PVCs, the VCCI
   is selected from the list of available VCCIs. The VCCI can  be
   signaled end-to-end within the Generic Information Transport (GIT)
   as part of the ITU Recommendation Q.2931 Setup message per ITU
   Recommendation Q.2941.2. Q.2941.2 proposes that bit 16 of a 16 bit
   VCCI  be  used to prevent glare in the allocation of VCCIs from
   either end. This Q.2941-based scheme is not adequate for preventing
   glare when a limited number of single-CID  PVCs are dynamically
   assigned to narrowband telephony connections. For this dynamic PVC
   context, a mechanism for glare reduction such as assigning the
   lowest available values from different ends is needed.

   The <cid> in AAL2 has the same value on both gateways that are part
   of the connection. It is expected that both gateways may be required
   to select AAL2 channels for different calls dependent on the
   direction from which the calls arrived. Therefore, the possibility
   will occur that gateways may be selecting the channel for two
   separate calls simultaneously.  In this context, a mechanism for
   glare reduction such as assigning the lowest available values from
   different ends is needed.

   The <port id> parameter is  used to identify the physical trunk port
   on a stand-alone  gateway  or on a multiplexer into  which the
   gateway is plugged as a tributary module. The <bcg> parameter refers
   to the bearer connection group as defined in Q.2630.1. The <vpi>,
   <vci>, <vcci> and <cid>  have their usual ATM connotation.

   The  <profileType> parameter indicates the type of profile. It is
   expressed in the format AAL2/<oui> where <oui> is an
   organizationally unique identifier. Currently defined values of
   <oui> are 'ITU', 'ATMF' and 'custom'. The resulting profileType
   values indicate the following:

        * AAL2/ITU indicates that AAL2 is used as the adaptation layer
          and the profiles are defined by ITU in specification I.366.2.


	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 10]
                                                               


        * AAL2/ATMF indicates that AAL2 is used as the adaptation layer
          and the profiles are defined by the ATM Forum in
          specification AF-VTOA-0113.
        * AAL2/custom indicates that AAL2 is used as the adaptation
          layer and the profiles are non-standard custom profiles.

   The <profile> parameter is expressed as a decimal number. The value
   of the profile for profiles of the type AAL2/ITU or AAL2/ATMF are in
   range 0-255 in accordance with ITU-T I.366.2 Annex P and AF-VTOA-
   0113.

   For example, the media information line may look like:

        m=audio 123/5 AAL2/ITU 1


   This media line indicates that the media contains audio. The VCCI
   for the AAL2 connection is decimal 123 and the CID is decimal 5. The
   AAL2 connection uses ITU profile 1 as defined in I.366.2.

      m=audio $  AAL2/ITU 8 AAL2/custom  100 AAL2/ITU 1

   implies that any AAL2 VCC  may be used (subject to glare rules).   A
   preferentially ordered list of profiles is suggested for this
   connection with AAL2/ITU 8 having the highest priority.


5.7 The Media Attribute Lines


   In an SDP  line sequence, the media information line 'm'  is
   followed by one or more media attribute or 'a'  lines. Media
   attribute lines are per the format below:

       a=<attribute>:<value>

   or

       a=<value>

   In general, media attribute lines are optional except when needed to
   qualify the media information line. This qualification is necessary
   when the "m" line for an AAL1 session specifies a payload type that
   needs to be dynamically mapped. The 'atmmap' media attribute line
   defined below is used for this purpose.

   The following media attribute lines are defined for use in
   descriptions of ATM-based narrowband telephony sessions:

        * The attributes defined in RFC2327 which allow indication of
          the direction in which a session is active. These are
          a=sendonly, a=recvonly, a=sendrecv, a=inactive.
        * The 'Ptime' attribute defined in RFC2327. It indicates the
          packet period.


	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 11]
                                                               






        * The 'atmmap' attribute. In the AAL1 context, this is used to
          dynamically map payload types into codec strings.
        * The 'eecid' attribute. This stands for 'end-to-end connection
          identifier'. It provides a  means of  correlating narrowband
          telephony connections with underlying ATM bearer connections.
          In the Q.BICC/ISUP+ context, the eecid is synonymous with the
          bnc-id (backbone network connection identifier). In the SDP
          session description, the more general term 'eecid' is used in
          order to provide a common SDP baseline for ATM  telephony
          applications using Q.BICC/ISUP+ and SIP/SIP+. 
        * The 'profiledesc' attribute which can be used to describe
          AAL2 profiles. Although any AAL2 profile can be so described,
          this attribute is useful for describing, at connection
          establishment time,  custom profiles that might not be known
          to the far end. This attribute applies in the AAL2 context
          only.
        * The 'vsel' attribute which, depending on the application, can
          indicate  preference for or selection of  a single voice
          codec. This can be optionally used in both the AAL1 and AAL2
          contexts in conjunction with the 'm' line.
        * The 'dsel' attribute which, depending on the application, can
          indicate  preference or selection of  a single voiceband data
          codec. This can be optionally used in both the AAL1 and AAL2
          contexts in conjunction with the 'm' line.
        * The 'fsel' attribute which, depending on the application, can
          indicate  preference or selection of  a single fax codec.
          This can be optionally used in both the AAL1 and AAL2
          contexts in conjunction with the 'm' line.
        * The 'qosclass' attribute which indicates the QoS class of the
          ATM bearer connection.


        * The 'qosparms' attribute which can be used to describe
          certain key QoS parameters (called Extended QoS parameters in
          UNI 4.0 and PNNI).
        * The 'gnrltrfcdesc' attribute which can be used to describe
          certain general  traffic parameters.
        * The 'atmtrfcdesc' attribute which can be used to describe
          certain key ATM  traffic parameters.

5.7.1       The 'atmmap' attribute


  The 'atmmap' attribute is defined on the basis of the 'rtpmap'

  attribute used in RFC2327.


        a=atmmap:<payload_type> <encoding_name>

   The 'atmmap' attribute is used to dynamically map encoding names
   into payload types. This is necessary for those encoding names which
   have not been assigned a static payload type through IANA. Payload
   types and encoding techniques that have been registered with IANA
   for RTP are retained for AAL1-based narrowband telephony.

   The encoding names in Table 1 are case-insensitive.

5.7.2   The 'eecid' attribute

   The 'eecid' attribute is synonymous with the 4-byte'bnc-id'
   parameter defined by T1SI, the ATM forum and the ITU Q.BICC
   standardization effort. The term 'eecid' stands for 'end-to-end
   connection identifier', while 'bnc-id' stands for 'backbone network
   connection identifier'. The name "backbone" is slightly misleading
   since it refers to the entire ATM network including the ATM edge and
   ATM core networks. In   Q.BICC terminology, an ATM "backbone"
   connects TDM or analog edges.

   While the term 'bnc-id' might be used in the bearer signaling plane
   and in an ISUP+/BICC call control plane,   SDP session descriptors
   use the neutral term 'eecid'. This provides a common SDP baseline
   for applications that use ISUP+/BICC and applications that use
   SIP/SIP+.

   In the forward SVC establishment model, the call-originating gateway
   initiates SVC establishment and transmits an eecid to the call-
   terminating gateway  via SDP.

   In backward SVC establishment model, the call-originating gateway
   does not  initiate  SVC establishment. However, it transmits an
   eecid to the call-terminating gateway via SDP. The call-terminating
   gateway initiates SVC establishment.

   The value of the eecid attribute  values needs to be unique within
   the gateway initiating the SVC set-up but not across multiple
   gateways. Hence, the SVC-initiating  gateway has complete control
   over using and releasing values of this  parameter. The eecid
   attribute is used to  correlate, one-to-one, received SVC SETUP
   requests with service connection requests  from the call agent. In
   the forward call model, the call-terminating gateway uses the ATM
   address of the call-originating gateway in the 'c' line of the
   session description to qualify the eecid. This is because multiple
   call-originating gateways can sending  identical eecids.

   Within an SDP session description, the eecid attribute is used as
   follows:

            a=eecid:<value>


  where <value> consists of up to 8 hex digits (equivalent to 4

  octets).


   The SVC-initiating gateway tunnels the eecid  value through  a
   Q.2931 (UNI, PNNI, AINI, IISP, proprietary Q.2931 equivalent ) set-
   up message or the Q.2630.1 Establish Request (ERQ) message.


	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 15]





   For Q.2931, the following viable options exist for tunneling the
   eecid through bearer-plane signaling messages:
        * Use the Generic Identifier Transport (GIT) IE. This  method
          is being standardized by the ATM forum for carriage of the
          'bnc-id' ('eecid').
        * Use the called party subaddress IE in the backward SVC call
          establishment model. Use the calling party subaddress IE in
          the forward SVC call establishment model.


   Several other non-viable options such as using the NSAP selector
   byte are not described here.

   For Q.2630.1, the SUGR (Served User Generated Reference)  IE can be
   used (subject to finalization of the standard).

   In the backward path set-up model, the call-originating gateway can
   release and re-use an eecid when it receives  Q.2931 set-up or
   Q.2630.1 establish request  from the call-terminating end. As
   described above, the 'eecid' is tunneled through this  Q.2931 or
   Q.2630.1 message.

   In the forward  path set-up model, the call-originating gateway can
   release and re-use an eecid when it receives  a Q.2931 connect  or
   Q.2630.1 establish confirm from the call-terminating end. This
   message need not carry  the eecid. The Q.2931 call reference or the
   Q.2630.1 Destination Signaling Association Identifier (DSAID) points
   to the eecid.

   Since the gateway that issued the  <eecid>  in the SDP 'owns' it,
   there can be no race conditions in re-using its value immediately on
   release. If not already released by the gateway issuing it, the
   <eecid>  value is released  by the issuing gateway if the connection
   is deleted or the connection set-up aborted.

5.7.3 The 'profiledesc' attribute

   There is one  'profiledesc' media attribute line  for each AAL2
   profile that is intended to be described.  The 'profiledesc' media
   attribute line  is  structured  as follows:

     a=profiledesc: <profileType> <profile>  <uui_code_range#1>
       <encoding name#1> <packet_length#1> <packet_time#1>
       <uui_code_range#2> <encoding name#2> <packet_length#2>
       <packet_time#2>... <uui_code_range#N> <encoding name#N>
        <packet_length#N> <packet_time#N>

   Here, <profileType>  and  <profile> are identical to their
   definition, above, for the 'm' line.

   The profile elements (rows in the profile tables of  ITU I.366.2 or
   AF-VTOA-0113) are represented as four-tuples following the <profile>
   parameter in the 'profiledesc' media attribute line. If a member of
   one of these four-tuples is not specified or is implied, then it is
   set to   '-'.

   The <uui_code_range> parameter is represented by D1-D2, where D1 and
   D2 are decimal integers in the range 0 through 15.

	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 16]


   The <encoding_name> parameter can take one of the values in column 2
   of Table 1. Additionally, it can take on the following descriptor
   strings:  "PCMG", "SIDG" and "SID729".  These stand for generic PCM,
   generic SID and G.729 SID respectively.

   The <packet_length> is a decimal integer representation of the AAL2
   packet length in octets.

   The <packet_time> is a decimal integer representation of the AAL2
   packetization interval in ms.

   For instance, the 'profiledesc' media attribute line below defines
   the AAL2/custom 100 profile. This profile is reproduced in the table 
   below. For a description of the parameters in this profile such as
   M and the sequence number interval, see ITU I.366.2.

     a=profiledesc:AAL2/custom 100 0-7 PCMG 40 5 0-7 SIDG 1 5 8-15
         G726-32 40 10 8-15 SIDG 1 5

   If the <packet_time> parameter is to be omitted or implied, then the
   same profile  can be represented as follows:

     a=profiledesc:AAL2/custom 100 0-7 PCMG 40 - 0-7 SIDG 1 - 8-15
          G726-32 40 - 8-15 SIDG 1 -

   If a gateway has a provisioned or hard coded definition of a
   profile, then any definition provided via the 'profiledesc' line
   overrides it. The exception to this rule is with regard to standard
   profiles such as ITU-defined profiles and ATMF-defined profiles. In
   general, these should not be defined via a 'profiledesc' media
   attribute line. If they are, then the definition needs to be
   consistent with the standard definition else the SDP session
   descriptor should be rejected with an appropriate error code.

5.7.4 The 'vsel' attribute

   The 'vsel' media attribute line can be  used to indicate either
   preference for or selection of  a single voice codec in ATM-based
   narrowband telephony applications. When present, it complements the
   media information 'm' line. The 'vsel' line is structured as
   follows:

      a=vsel:<encoding_name> <packet_length><packet_time>

   where the <encoding_name> parameter can take one of the values in
   column 2 of Table 1. The <packet_length> and <packet_time>
   parameters are per their definition, above, for the 'profiledesc'
   media attribute line. Each of these parameters (<encoding_name>,
   <packet_length>and <packet_time>) can be set to '-' when not needed.
   Also, the entire 'vsel' media attribute line can be omitted when not
   needed. For example,                                                              

        a=vsel:G729 10 10

   indicates preference for or selection of G.729 or G.729a (both are
   interoperable) as the voice encoding scheme.  A packet length of 10
   octets and a packetization interval of 10 ms are indicated in this
   media attribute line.  If the packet length and packetization
   interval are intended to be omitted, then this media attribute line
   becomes

        a=vsel:G729 - -

   The media attribute line

         a=vsel:G726-32 40 10

   indicates preference for or selection of 32 kbps ADPCM with a packet
   length of 40 octets and a packetization interval of 10 ms.

5.7.5 The 'dsel' attribute

   The 'dsel' media attribute line can be  used to indicate either
   preference for or selection of  a single voiceband data codec in
   ATM-based narrowband telephony applications.  If an 'fsel' media
   attribute line is not present in the SDP session descriptor, then
   'dsel' applies to both modem data and fax data (unless the latter is
   well-known by default). If an 'fsel' media attribute line is  indeed
   present in the same SDP session description, then 'dsel' applies to
   modem data but not to fax data.  When present, 'dsel'  complements
   the media information 'm' line. The 'dsel' line is structured as
   follows:

        a=dsel:<encoding_name><packet_length><packet_time>

   where the <encoding_name> parameter can take one of the values in
   column 2 of Table 1. The <packet_length> and <packet_time>
   parameters are per their definition, above, for the 'profiledesc'
   media attribute line. Each of these parameters (<encoding_name>,
   <packet_length>and <packet_time>) can be set to '-' when not needed.
   Also, the entire 'dsel' media attribute line can be omitted when not
   needed.

	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 18]

   For example,

       a=dsel:G726-32 20 5

   indicates preference for or selection of 32 kbps ADPCM  with a
   packet length of 20 octets and a packetization interval of 5 ms as
   the voiceband data  encoding scheme.

5.7.6 The 'fsel' attribute

   The 'fsel' media attribute line can be  used to indicate either
   preference for or selection of  a single fax data codec in ATM-based
   narrowband telephony applications.   If an 'fsel' media attribute
   line is not present in the SDP session descriptor, then 'dsel'
   applies to both modem data and fax data (unless the latter is well-
   known by default).  When present, 'fsel'  complements the media
   information 'm' line. The 'fsel' line is structured as follows:

      a=fsel:<encoding_name> <packet_length><packet_time>

   where the <encoding_name> parameter can take one of the values in
   column 2 of Table 1. The <packet_length> and <packet_time>
   parameters are per their definition, above, for the 'profiledesc'
   media attribute line. Each of these parameters (<encoding_name>,
   <packet_length>and <packet_time>) can be set to '-' when not needed.
   Also, the entire 'fsel' media attribute line can be omitted when not
   needed.

   For example,

        a=fsel:FXDMOD-3 - -

   indicates demodulation and remodulation of ITU-T group 3 fax at the
   gateway.

5.7.7  The 'qosclass' attribute

   When present, the   'qosclass' attribute indicates one QoS class
   specified by the entity constructing the SDP session description.
   The  'qosclass' media attribute line is structured as follows:

       a=qosclass: <QoS_class>

   Here, <QoS_class> is a string that is understood by all  entities
   which parse or build the SDP descriptor. Possible values of this
   parameter are per the ATMF forum af-tm-0056.000 definition ('cbr',
   'rt-vbr', 'nrt-vbr', 'abr', 'ubr' and 'gfr') or the ITU I.371
   definition ('sbr1', 'sbr2', 'sbr3', 'dbr', 'abt/dt', 'abt/it' and
   'abr').

   These string values are case-insensitive. When the bearer connection
   is a single CID within a multiplexed AAL2 VC, then this SDP
   attribute does not apply.


	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 19]

                                                                


5.7.8 The 'qosparms' attribute

   When present, the 'qosparms' attribute can be used to describe
   certain key QoS parameters (called Extended QoS parameters in UNI
   4.0 and PNNI). In this context, these parameters can refer to
   acceptable values (worst case) and can be used by the bearer
   signaling and routing protocols.

   The 'qosparms' media attribute line is structured as follows:

      a=qosparms:<bsunit> <fjit> <fltcy> <flr> <bjit> <bltcy> <blr>

   The <bsunit> parameter indicates the base unit used for the
   remaining parameters in the 'qosparms' media attribute line. In the
   'qosparms' media attribute line, it can take on the values 'p' or
   'c'. A value of 'p' indicates that the remainder of the 'qosparms'
   media attribute line refers to packet latency, jitter and loss
   ratio. An example of such a packet stream is  an AAL2 packet stream
   referenced by a CID value. A value of 'c' indicates that the
   remainder of the 'qosparms' media attribute line refers to cell
   latency, jitter and loss ratio.

   <fjit> and <bjit> refer to the forward and backward jitter in
   microseconds. As qualified by <bsunit>, this can be packet jitter or
   cell jitter. It is probably adequate to express it as a decimal
   integer, although fractional values are not excluded.

   <fltcy> and <bltcy> refer to the forward and backward latency in
   microseconds. As qualified by <bsunit>, this can be packet latency
   or cell latency. It is probably adequate to express it as a decimal
   integer, although fractional values are not excluded.

   <flr> and <blr> refer to  forward and backward loss ratios.  As
   qualified by <bsunit>, this can be packet loss ratio or cell loss
   ratio. The ratio referred to is between the number of units
   (packets/cells) lost and the number of units transmitted. It is
   expressed as an order of magnitude n, where the loss ratio takes on
   the value 10 to the minus n. The value of n is coded as a decimal
   integer.

   Within the 'qosparms' media attribute line, forward (f) refers to
   the direction from the entity initiating  Bearer signaling (Q.2931-
   based or Q.2630.1-based). Backward (b) refers to the opposite
   direction.

   If any of these parameters is not specified, inapplicable or is
   implied, then it is set to   '-'.

   An example use of the <qosparms> attribute for an  rt-VBR, single-
   CID AAL2 voice VC is:

        a=qosparms:c 8125 32000 11 4675 18000 12





	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 20]
                                                                


   This implies a forward path cell delay variation of 8.125 ms, a
   backward path cell delay variation of 4.675 ms, a forward path
   latency of 32 ms, a backward path latency of 18 ms, a forward path
   cell loss ratio of 10 to the minus 11 and a backward path cell loss
   ratio of  10 to the minus 12.


5.7.9 The 'gnrltrfcdesc' attribute

   When present, the 'gnrltrfcdesc' attribute can be used to indicate
   traffic rates and  maximum burst sizes.  The  'gnrltrfcdesc' media
   attribute line is structured as follows:

      a=gnrltrfcdesc:<bsunit> <fpr> <fsr> <fmr> <fmbs> <bpr>
        <bsr><bmr> <bmbs>

   The <bsunit> parameter indicates the base unit used for the
   remaining parameters in the 'gnrltrfcdesc' media attribute line. In
   the 'gnrltrfcdesc' media attribute line, it can take on the values
   'p', 'c', 'b' and 'o'.

   A value of 'p' indicates that packets per second and packets are
   used respectively as the units for rates and burst sizes in the
   remainder of the 'gnrltrfcdesc' media  attribute line. A value of
   'c' indicates that cells per second and  cells are used respectively
   as the units for rates and burst sizes in the remainder of the
   'gnrltrfcdesc' media  attribute line.  A value of 'b' indicates that
   bits per second and  bits are used respectively as the units for
   rates and burst sizes in the remainder of the 'gnrltrfcdesc' media
   attribute line. A value of 'o' indicates that octets per second and
   octets are used respectively as the units for rates and burst sizes
   in the remainder of the 'gnrltrfcdesc' media  attribute line.  Units
   of packets, cells, bits or octets are applicable depending on the
   application context. For instance, when the underlying bearer
   connection is an AAL1 VC or a single-CID AAL2 VC, cells are the
   appropriate unit. When the underlying bearer connection is a
   multiplexed AAL2 VC, packets are the appropriate unit.


   <fpr> and <bpr> are the forward and backward peak  rates. Depending
   of the value of <bsunit>, their units are packets per second, cells
   per second, bits per second or octets per second. When referring to
   an ATM VC, <fpr> and <bpr> apply to cells with CLP values of 0 or 1
   within the nrt-VBR, rt-VBR and CBR QoS classes.

   <fsr> and <bsr> are the forward and backward sustainable rates.
   Depending of the value of <bsunit>, their units are packets per
   second, cells per second, bits per second or octets per second. When
   referring to an ATM VC, <fsr> and <bsr> apply to cells with a CLP
   value of 0 within the nrt-VBR and rt-VBR QoS classes.

   <fmr> and <bmr> are the forward and backward minimum rates.
   Depending of the value of <bsunit>, their units are packets per
   second, cells per second, bits per second or octets per second. When

	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 21]
                                                                

   referring to an ATM VC, <fmr> and <bmr> apply to cells with CLP
   values of 0 or 1 within the ABR  QoS class.

   <fmbs> and <bmbs> are the forward and backward maximum burst sizes.
   Depending of the value of <bsunit>, their units are packets, cells,
   bits or octets. When referring to an ATM VC, <fmbs> and <bmbs> apply
   to cells with a CLP value of 0 within the nrt-VBR and  rt-VBR QoS
   classes.

   Within the 'gnrltrfcdesc' media attribute line, forward (f) refers
   to the direction from the entity initiating  Bearer signaling
   (Q.2931-based or Q.2630.1-based). Backward (b) refers to the
   opposite direction.

   If any of these parameters is not specified, inapplicable or is
   implied, then it is set to   '-'.

   An example use of the <gnrltrfcdesc> attribute for an  rt-VBR,
   single-CID AAL2 voice VC is:

        a=gnrltrfcdesc:c 200 100 - 20 200 100 - 20

   This implies a forward and backward PCR of 200 cells per second, a
   forward and backward SCR of 100 cells per second, an  MCR that is
   unspecified since it is inapplicable and a forward and backward
   maximum burst size of 20 cells.

5.7.10 The 'atmtrfcdesc' attribute

   When present, the 'atmtrfcdesc' attribute can be used to indicate
   ATM-specific traffic parameters such as  CLP tagging, frame discard
   and best effort indicators. The  'atmtrfcdesc' media attribute line
   is structured as follows:

        a=atmtrfcdesc: <bei> <ffd> <fte> <bfd> <bte>

   <bei> is the best effort indicator flag. It can take on the values
   of "on" and "off". An "on" value applies only to the UBR QoS class.

   <ffd> and <bfd> indicate that frame discard is permitted in the
   forward or  backward directions. These can take on the values of
   "on" or "off".

   <fte> (forward tag enable) and <bte> (backward tag enable) indicate
   that CLP tagging is requested in the forward or backward directions.
   These can take on the values of "on" or "off".

   In these parameters, forward (f) refers to the direction from the
   entity initiating  Bearer signaling (Q.2931-based or Q.2630.1-
   based). Backward (b) refers to the opposite direction.

   If any of these parameters is not specified or is implied, then it
   is set to   '-'.

	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 22]
 





   An example use of the <atmtrfcdesc> attribute for an  rt-VBR,
   single-CID AAL2 voice VC is:

        a=atmtrfcdesc:- off off off off

   This implies that best effort is inapplicable and that frame discard
   and CLP tagging are disabled in the forward and backward directions.


5.8     Examples of ATM session descriptions using SDP

   An example of  a complete AAL1 session description in SDP is:

     v=0
     o=- A3C47F21456789F0 0 ATM NSAP
        47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00
     s=-
     c=ATM NSAP
         47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00
     t=0 0
     m=audio $ AAL1/AVP 18 0 96
     a=atmmap:96 G727-32
     a=eecid:B3D58E32

   An example of  a complete AAL2 session description in SDP is:

     v=0
     o=- A3C47F21456789F0 0 ATM NSAP
     47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00
     s=-
     c=ATM NSAP 
		47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00
     t=0 0
     m=audio $ AAL2/ITU 8 AAL2/custom 100 AAL2/ITU 1
     a=eecid:B3E32




















	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 23]

 


   The AAL2 session descriptor below is the same as the one above
   except that it states an explicit preference for a voice codec, a
   voiceband data codec and a voiceband fax codec. Further, it defines
   the profile AAL2/custom 100 rather than assume that the far-end is
   cognizant of the elements of this profile.

     v=0
     o=- A3C47F21456789F0 0 ATM NSAP
     47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00
     s=-
     c=ATM NSAP
     47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00
     t=0 0
     m=audio $ AAL2/ITU 8 AAL2/custom 100 AAL2/ITU 1
     a=eecid:B3E32
     a=profiledesc:AAL2/custom 100 0-7 PCMG 40 5 0-7 SIDG 1
     5 8-15 G726-32 40 10 8-15 SIDG 1 5
     a=vsel:G726-32 40 10
     a=dsel:PCMU - -
     a=fsel:G726-32 40 10

5.9     Representation of data media

   The following  encoding names  in Table 1  can refer to data as well
   as audio media: CCD and CCD-CAS   in Table 1.

   The following encoding names in Table 1  refer to data media:
   FXDMOD-3 in Table 1.

   In the AAL1 context, the  media information line  for these   media
   should be constructed as follows:

   <virtualConnectionId> is as defined above in this document for AAL1
   sessions. 'DP'  stands for 'data profile' along the lines of 'AVP'
   for 'audio-video profile'.

   <aggregation_mode> specifies the number of TDM DS0s that are
   aggregated by this encoding. For T1-based applications, it can take
   on integral values in the inclusive range [1...24]. For E1-based
   applications, it can take on integral values in the inclusive range
   [1...31].   The default value is 1  and is equivalent to omitting
   this parameter. Setting this parameter to a   '-' is equivalent to
   omitting it.

   In the AAL2  context, the  media information line  for these data
   media  should be  structured as follows:

   <virtualConnectionId> is as defined above in this document for AAL2
   sessions. 'DP'  stands for 'data profile' along the lines of 'AVP'
   for 'audio-video profile'.

    <aggregation_mode> is as defined above for the AAL1 context.


	Rajesh Kumar, Mohamed Mostafa				       [Page 24]
                                                                




   Note that there is only one encoding technique specified in the
   media information line. This is because:

        * In the case of n x 64 kbps clear channel data, there only one
          encoding and packetization format given a particular  'n' and
          a particular adaptation (AAL1/AAL2).
        * In the case of fax demodulation and remodulation (ITU
          I.366.2),  parameters such as information type, image data
          size and control type are negotiated  in the 'bearer plane'
          via type 3 messages. Therefore, there is no need to define
          several alternate encoding techniques.  Similarly, for
          sending fax over IP, it is likely that 'bearer plane'
          messages will be used to synchronize the two ends. Also, AAL1
          is not likely to be used for relaying demodulated fax data
          and control.

   Examples of valid representations of data media are:

      m=data 29 AAL1/DP CCD 6

   This indicates that VCCI=29 uses AAL1 encapsulation to transmit an
   nx64 clear channel with n=6.

      m=data 122/8 AAL2/DP CCD 12


   This indicates that VCCI/CID=122/8  uses AAL2 encapsulation to
   transmit an nx64 clear channel with n=12.

      m=data 122/8 AAL2/DP FXMOD-3 '-'

   This indicates that VCCI/CID=122/8  uses AAL2 encapsulation to
   transmit group 3 demodulated facsimile and the associated control.

      m=data 122/8 AAL2/DP FXMOD-3

   This indicates that VCCI/CID=122/8  uses AAL2 encapsulation to
   transmit group 3 demodulated facsimile and the associated control.

6.0 Security Considerations

   Security considerations for SDP extended for ATM are similar to
   those for standard SDP described in RFC2327. In general, the SDP
   session descriptions might originate in untrusted areas such as
   equipment owned by end-subscribers or located at end-subscriber
   premises. SDP relies on the security mechanisms of the encapsulating
   protocol or layers below the encapsulating protocol. Examples of
   encapsulating protocols are the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   and the Multimedia Gateway Control Protocol (MEGACO). These
   protocols can use IPSec authentication as described in RFC1826 [Ref.
   27]. IPSec encryption can be optionally used with authentication to
   provide an additional, potentially more expensive level of security.
   IPSec security associations can be made between equipment located in
   untrusted areas and equipment located in trusted areas through
   configured shared secrets or the use of a certificate authority.
