1. Introduction 

   The MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) has been widely accepted not 
   only for providing digital TV services, but also as a subnetwork 
   technology for building IP networks. RFC 4326 [RFC4326] describes 
   the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) mechanism for 
   the transport of IPv4 and IPv6 Datagrams and other network 
   protocol packets directly over the ISO MPEG-2 Transport Stream as 
   TS Private Data. ULE specifies a base encapsulation format and 
   supports an Extension Header format that allows it to carry 
   additional header information to assist in network/Receiver 
   processing. The encapsulation satisfies the design and 
   architectural requirement for a lightweight encapsulation defined 
   in RFC 4259 [RFC4259].

   Section 3.1 of RFC 4259 presents several topological scenarios 
   for MPEG-2 Transmission Networks. A summary of these scenarios 
   are presented below (see section 3.1 of RFC 4259): 

   A. Broadcast TV and Radio Delivery. This is not within the scope 
      of this document.  

   B. Broadcast Networks used as an ISP. This resembles scenario A, 
      but includes IP services to access the public Internet.  

   C. Unidirectional Star IP Scenario. This provides a data network 
      delivering a common bit stream to typically medium-sized 
      groups of Receivers.  

   D. Datacast Overlay. This employs MPEG-2 physical and link layers 
      to provide additional connectivity such as unidirectional 
      multicast to supplement an existing IP-based Internet service.  

   E. Point-to-Point Links. This connectivity may be provided using 
      a pair of transmit and receive interfaces. 

   F. Two-Way IP Networks.  

   RFC 4259 states that ULE must be robust to errors and security 
   threats. Security must also consider both unidirectional (A, B, C 
   and D) as well as bidirectional (E and F) links for the scenarios 
   mentioned above.  

   An initial analysis of the security requirements in MPEG-2 
   transmission networks is presented in the security considerations 
   section of RFC 4259. For example, when such networks are not 
   using a wireline network, the normal security issues relating to 
   the use of wireless links for transport of Internet traffic 
   should be considered [RFC3819].  

   The security considerations of RFC 4259 recommend that any new 
   encapsulation defined by the IETF should allow Transport Stream 
   encryption and should also support optional link-layer 
   authentication of the SNDU payload. In ULE [RFC4326], it is 
   suggested that this may be provided in a flexible way using 
   Extension Headers. This requires the definition of a mandatory 
   Extension Header, but has the advantage that it decouples 
   specification of the security functions from the encapsulation 
   functions.  

   This document extends the above analysis and derives in detail 
   the security requirements for ULE in MPEG-2 transmission

   networks. 

   A security framework for deployment of secure ULE networks 
   describing the different building blocks and the interface 
   definitions is presented in Appendix A.

   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

   Other terms used in this document are defined below: 

   ATSC: Advanced Television Systems Committee. A framework and a 
   set of associated standards for the transmission of video, audio, 
   and data using the ISO MPEG-2 standard. 

   DVB: Digital Video Broadcast. A framework and set of associated 
   standards published by the European Telecommunications Standards 
   Institute (ETSI) for the transmission of video, audio, and data 
   using the ISO MPEG-2 Standard [ISO-MPEG2]. 

   Encapsulator: A network device that receives PDUs and formats 
   these into Payload Units (known here as SNDUs) for output as a 
   stream of TS Packets. 

   GCKS: Group Controller and Key Server. A server that 
   authenticates and provides the policy and keying material to 
   members of a secure group.

   NPA: Network Point of Attachment.  In this document, refers to a 
   6-byte destination address (resembling an IEEE Medium Access 
   Control address) within the MPEG-2 transmission network that is 
   used to identify individual Receivers or groups of Receivers. 

   PDU: Protocol Data Unit.  Examples of a PDU include Ethernet 
   frames, IPv4 or IPv6 datagrams, and other network packets. 

   PID: Packet Identifier [ISO-MPEG2].  A 13-bit field carried in 
   the header of TS Packets.  This is used to identify the TS 
   Logical Channel to which a TS Packet belongs [ISO-MPEG2].  The TS 
   Packets forming the parts of a Table Section, PES, or other 
   Payload Unit must all carry the same PID value.  The all-zeros 
   PID 0x0000 as well as other PID values are reserved for specific 
   PSI/SI Tables [ISO-MPEG2]. The all-ones PID value 0x1FFF 
   indicates a Null TS Packet introduced to maintain a constant bit 
   rate of a TS Multiplex.  There is no required relationship 
   between the PID values used for TS Logical Channels transmitted 
   using different TS Multiplexes.

   and performs filtering and forwarding of encapsulated PDUs to the 
   network-layer service (or bridging module when operating at the 
   link layer). 

   SI Table: Service Information Table [ISO-MPEG2].  In this 
   document, this term describes a table that is defined by another 
   standards body to convey information about the services carried 
   in a TS Multiplex. A Table may consist of one or more Table 
   Sections; however, all sections of a particular SI Table must be 
   carried over a single TS Logical Channel [ISO-MPEG2]. 

   SNDU: SubNetwork Data Unit. An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2 
   Payload Unit. 

   TS: Transport Stream [ISO-MPEG2], a method of transmission at the 
   MPEG-2 layer using TS Packets; it represents layer 2 of the 
   ISO/OSI reference model.  See also TS Logical Channel and TS 
   Multiplex. 

   TS Multiplex: In this document, this term defines a set of MPEG-2 
   TS Logical Channels sent over a single lower-layer connection.  
   This may be a common physical link (i.e., a transmission at a 
   specified symbol rate, FEC setting, and transmission frequency) 
   or an encapsulation provided by another protocol layer (e.g., 
   Ethernet, or RTP over IP). The same TS Logical Channel may be 
   repeated over more than one TS Multiplex (possibly associated

   with a different PID value) [RFC4259]; for example, to 
   redistribute the same multicast content to two terrestrial TV 
   transmission cells. 

   TS Packet: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over a TS 
   Multiplex [ISO-MPEG2].  Each TS Packet carries a 4B header, plus 
   optional overhead including an Adaptation Field, encryption 
   details, and time stamp information to synchronise a set of 
   related TS Logical Channels. 

   ULE Stream: An MPEG-2 TS Logical Channel that carries only ULE 
   encapsulated PDUs. ULE Streams may be identified by definition of 
   a stream_type in SI/PSI [ISO-MPEG2].

   As shown in Figure 1 above (from section 3.3 of [RFC4259]), there 
   are several entities within the MPEG-2 transmission network 
   architecture. These include: 

   o ULE Encapsulation Gateways (the ULE Encapsulator) 

   o SI-Table signalling generator (input to the multiplexer) 

   o Receivers (the endpoints for ULE Streams)

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   o TS multiplexers (including re-multiplexers) 

   o Modulators 

   The TS Packets are carried to the Receiver over a physical layer 
   that usually includes Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding that 
   interleaves the bytes of several consecutive, but unrelated, TS 
   Packets. FEC-coding and synchronisation processing makes 
   injection of single TS Packets very difficult. Replacement of a 
   sequence of packets is also difficult, but possible (see section 
   3.2).  

   A Receiver in an MPEG-2 TS transmission network needs to identify 
   a TS Logical Channel (or MPEG-2 Elementary Stream) to reassemble 
   the fragments of PDUs sent by a L2 source [RFC4259]. In an MPEG-2 
   TS, this association is made via the Packet Identifier, PID [ISO-
   MPEG2]. At the sender, each source associates a locally unique 
   set of PID values with each stream it originates. However, there 
   is no required relationship between the PID value used at the 
   sender and that received at the Receiver. Network devices may re-
   number the PID values associated with one or more TS Logical 
   Channels (e.g. ULE Streams) to prevent clashes at a multiplexer 
   between input streams with the same PID carried on different 
   input multiplexes (updating entries in the PMT [ISO-MPEG2], and 
   other SI tables that reference the PID value). A device may also 
   modify and/or insert new SI data into the control plane (also 
   sent as TS Packets identified by their PID value). However, there 
   is only one valid source of data for each MPEG-2 Elementary 
   Stream, bound to a PID value. (This observation could simplify 
   the requirement for authentication of the source of a ULE 
   Stream.) 

   In an MPEG-2 network a set of signalling messages [RFC4947] may 
   need to be broadcast (e.g. by an Encapsulation Gateway or other 
   device) to form the L2 control plane. Examples of signalling 
   messages include the Program Association Table (PAT), Program Map 
   Table (PMT) and Network Information Table (NIT). In existing 
   MPEG-2 transmission networks, these messages are broadcast in the 
   clear (no encryption or integrity checks). The integrity as well 
   as authenticity of these messages is important for correct 
   working of the ULE network, i.e. supporting its security 
   objectives in the area of availability, in addition to 
   confidentiality and integrity. One method recently proposed 
   [RFC5163] encapsulates these messages using ULE. In such cases 
   all the security requirements of this document apply in securing 
   these signalling messages.

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   ULE Stream security only concerns the security between the ULE 
   Encapsulation Gateway (ULE Encapsulator) and the Receiver. In 
   many deployment scenarios the user of a ULE Stream has to secure 
   communications beyond the link since other network links are 
   utilised in addition to the ULE link. Therefore, if 
   authentication of the end-points, i.e. the IP Sources is 
   required, or users are concerned about loss of confidentiality, 
   integrity, or authenticity of their communication data, they will 
   have to employ end-to-end network security mechanisms, e.g. IPsec 
   or Transport Layer Security (TLS). Governmental users may be 
   forced by regulations to employ specific approved implementations 
   of those mechanisms. Hence for such cases, the requirements for 
   confidentiality and integrity of the user data will be met by the 
   end-to-end security mechanism and the ULE security measures would 
   focus on either providing traffic flow confidentiality for user 
   data that has already been encrypted or for users who choose not 
   to implement end-to-end security mechanisms. 

   ULE links may also be used for communications where the two IP 
   end-points are not under central control (e.g., when browsing a 
   public web site). In these cases, it may be impossible to enforce 
   any end-to-end security mechanisms. Yet, a common objective is 
   that users may make the same security assumptions as for wired 
   links [RFC3819]. ULE security could achieve this by protecting 
   the vulnerable (in terms of passive attacks) ULE Stream. 

   In contrast to the above, a ULE Stream can be used to link 
   networks such as branch offices to a central office. ULE link-
   layer security could be the sole provider of confidentiality and 
   integrity. In this scenario, users requiring high assurance of 
   security (e.g. government use) will need to employ approved 
   cryptographic equipment (e.g. at the network layer). An 
   implementation of ULE Link Security equipment could also be 
   certified for use by specific user communities. 

   3.2. Threats 

   The simplest type of network threat is a passive threat. This 
   includes eavesdropping or monitoring of transmissions, with a 
   goal to obtain information that is being transmitted. In 
   broadcast networks (especially those utilising widely available 
   low-cost physical layer interfaces, such as DVB) passive threats 
   are the major threats. One example is an intruder monitoring the 
   MPEG-2 transmission broadcast and then extracting the data 
   carried within the link. Another example is an intruder trying to 
   determine the identity of the communicating parties and the 
   volume of their traffic by sniffing (L2) addresses. This is a

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   well-known issue in the security field; however it is more of a 
   problem in the case of broadcast networks such as MPEG-2 
   transmission networks because of the easy availability of 
   Receiver hardware and the wide geographical span of the networks. 

   Active threats (or attacks) are, in general, more difficult to 
   implement successfully than passive threats, and usually require 
   more sophisticated resources and may require access to the 
   transmitter. Within the context of MPEG-2 transmission networks, 
   examples of active attacks are: 

   o Masquerading: An entity pretends to be a different entity. 
      This includes masquerading other users and subnetwork control 
      plane messages.  

   o Modification of messages in an unauthorised manner.  

   o Replay attacks: When an intruder sends some old (authentic) 
      messages to the Receiver. In the case of a broadcast link, 
      access to previous broadcast data is easy.  

   o Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: When an entity fails to 
      perform its proper function or acts in a way that prevents 
      other entities from performing their proper functions. 

   The active threats mentioned above are major security concerns 
   for the Internet community [BELLOVIN]. Masquerading and 
   modification of IP packets are comparatively easy in an Internet 
   environment, whereas such attacks are in fact much harder for 
   MPEG-2 broadcast links. This could for instance motivate the 
   mandatory use of sequence numbers in IPsec, but not for 
   synchronous links. This is further reflected in the security 
   requirements for Case 2 and 3 in section 4 below. 

   As explained in section 3.1, the PID associated with an 
   Elementary Stream can be modified (e.g. in some systems by 
   reception of an updated SI table, or in other systems until the 
   next announcement/discovery data is received). An attacker that 
   is able to modify the content of the received multiplex (e.g. 
   replay data and/or control information) could inject data locally 
   into the received stream with an arbitrary PID value. 

   3.3. Threat Cases 

   Analysing the topological scenarios for MPEG-2 Transmission 
   Networks in section 1, the security threats can be abstracted 
   into three cases:

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   o Case 1: Monitoring (passive threat). Here the intruder 
      monitors the ULE broadcasts to gain information about the ULE 
      data and/or tracking the communicating parties identities (by 
      monitoring the destination NPA address). In this scenario, 
      measures must be taken to protect the ULE payload data and the 
      identity of ULE Receivers. 

   o Case 2: Locally conduct active attacks on the MPEG-TS 
      multiplex. Here an intruder is assumed to be sufficiently 
      sophisticated to over-ride the original transmission from the 
      ULE Encapsulation Gateway and deliver a modified version of 
      the MPEG-TS transmission to a single ULE Receiver or a small 
      group of Receivers (e.g. in a single company site). The MPEG-2 
      transmission network operator might not be aware of such 
      attacks. Measures must be taken to ensure ULE data integrity 
      and authenticity and preventing replay of old messages. 

   o Case 3: Globally conduct active attacks on the MPEG-TS 
      multiplex. This assumes a sophisticated intruder able to over-
      ride the whole MPEG-2 transmission multiplex. The requirements 
      are similar to scenario 2. The MPEG-2 transmission network 
      operator can usually identify such attacks and provide 
      corrective action to restore the original transmission. 

   For both Cases 2 and 3, there can be two sub-cases: 

   o Insider attacks, i.e. active attacks from adversaries within 
   the network with knowledge of the secret material. 

   o Outsider attacks, i.e. active attacks from adversaries without 
   knowledge of the secret material. 

   In terms of priority, Case 1 is considered the major threat in 
   MPEG-2 transmission systems. Case 2 is considered a lesser 
   threat, appropriate to specific network configurations, 
   especially when vulnerable to insider attacks. Case 3 is less 
   likely to be found in an operational network, and is expected to 
   be noticed by the MPEG-2 transmission operator. It will require 
   restoration of the original transmission. The assumption being 
   that physical access to the network components (multiplexers, 
   etc.) and/or connecting physical media is secure. Therefore Case 
   3 is not considered further in this document. 

4. Security Requirements for IP over MPEG-2 TS 

   From the threat analysis in section 3, the following security 
   requirements can be derived:

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   Req 1. Data confidentiality MUST be provided by a link that 
      supports ULE Stream Security to prevent passive attacks and 
      reduce the risk of active threats. 

   Req 2. Protection of L2 NPA address is OPTIONAL. In broadcast 
      networks this protection can be used to prevent an intruder 
      tracking the identity of ULE Receivers and the volume of their 
      traffic. 

   Req 3. Integrity protection and source authentication of ULE 
      Stream data are OPTIONAL. These can be used to prevent active 
      attacks described in section 3.2. 

   Req 4. Protection against replay attacks is OPTIONAL. This is 
      used to counter active attacks described in section 3.2. 

   Req 5. L2 ULE Source and Receiver authentication is OPTIONAL. 
      This can be performed during the initial key exchange and 
      authentication phase, before the ULE Receiver can join a 
      secure session with the ULE Encapsulator (ULE source). This 
      could be either unidirectional or bidirectional authentication 
      based on the underlying key management protocol. 

   Other general requirements for all threat cases for link-layer 
   security are:  

   GReq (a) ULE key management functions MUST be decoupled from ULE 
     security services such as encryption and source authentication. 
     This allows the independent development of both systems. 

   GReq (b) Support SHOULD be provided for automated as well as 
     manual insertion of keys and policy into the relevant 
     databases. 

   GReq (c) Algorithm agility MUST be supported. It should be 
     possible to update the crypto algorithms and hashes when they 
     become obsolete without affecting the overall security of the 
     system. 

   GReq (d) The security extension header MUST be compatible with 
     other ULE extension headers. The method must allow other 
     extension headers (either mandatory or optional) to be used in 
     combination with a security extension. It is RECOMMENDED that 
     these are placed after the security extension header. This 
     permits full protection for all headers. It also avoids 
     situations where the SNDU has to be discarded on processing the 
     security extension header, while preceding headers have already 
 
 
Cruickshank et.al.     Expires February 22, 2009          [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

     been evaluated. One exception is the Timestamp extension which 
     SHOULD precede the security extension header [RFC5163]. In this 
     case, the timestamp will be unaffected by security services 
     such as data confidentiality and can be decoded without the 
     need for key material. 

   Examining the threat cases in section 3.3, the security 
   requirements for each case can be summarised as: 

   o Case 1: Data confidentiality (Req 1) MUST be provided to 
      prevent monitoring of the ULE data (such as user information 
      and IP addresses). Protection of NPA addresses (Req 2) MAY be 
      provided to prevent tracking ULE Receivers and their 
      communications. 

   o Case 2: In addition to Case 1 requirements, new measures MAY 
      be implemented such as authentication schemes using Message 
      Authentication Codes, digital signatures, or TESLA [RFC4082] 
      in order to provide integrity protection and source 
      authentication (Req 3 and Req 5). In addition, sequence 
      numbers (Req 4) MAY be used to protect against replay attacks. 
      In terms of outsider attacks, group authentication using 
      Message Authentication Codes can provide the required level of 
      security (Req 3 and 5). This will significantly reduce the 
      ability of intruders to successfully inject their own data 
      into the MPEG-TS stream. However, scenario 2 threats apply 
      only in specific service cases, and therefore authentication 
      and protection against replay attacks are OPTIONAL. Such 
      measures incur additional transmission as well as processing 
      overheads. Moreover, intrusion detection systems may also be 
      needed by the MPEG-2 network operator. These should best be 
      coupled with perimeter security policy to monitor common DoS 
      attacks. 

   o Case 3: As stated in section 3.3, the requirements here are 
      similar to Case 2, but since the MPEG-2 transmission network 
      operator can usually identify such attacks, the constraints on 
      intrusion detections are less than in Case 2. 

   Table 1 below shows the threats that are applicable to ULE 
   networks, and the relevant security mechanisms to mitigate those 
   threats.

5. Design recommendations for ULE Security Extension Header  

   Table 1 may assist in selecting fields within a ULE Security 
   Extension Header framework. 
    
   Security services may be grouped into profiles based on security 
   requirements, e.g. a base profile (with payload encryption and 
   identity protection), and a second profile that extends this to 
   also provide source authentication and protection against replay 
   attacks. 

   A modular design of ULE security may allow it to use and benefit 
   from existing key management protocols, such as GSAKMP [RFC4535] 
   and GDOI [RFC3547] defined by the IETF Multicast Security (MSEC) 
   working group. This does not preclude the use of other key 
   management methods in scenarios where this is more appropriate. 

   IPsec [RFC4301] and TLS [RFC4346] also provide a proven security 
   architecture defining key exchange mechanisms and the ability to 
   use a range of cryptographic algorithms. ULE security can make 
   use of these established mechanisms and algorithms. See appendix 
   A for more details.

6. Compatibility with Generic Stream Encapsulation 

   RFC 5163 [RFC5163] describes three new Extension Headers that may 
   be used with Unidirectional Link Encapsulation, ULE, [RFC4326] 
   and the Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) that has been designed 
   for the Generic Mode (also known as the Generic Stream (GS)), 
   offered by second-generation DVB physical layers [GSE]. 

   The security threats and requirements presented in this document 
   are applicable to ULE and GSE encapsulations. 

7. Summary 

   This document analyses a set of threats and security 
   requirements. It defines the requirements for ULE security and 
   states the motivation for link security as a part of the 
   Encapsulation layer. 

   ULE security must provide link-layer encryption and ULE Receiver 
   identity protection. The framework must support the optional 
   ability to provide for link-layer authentication and integrity 
   assurance, as well as protection against insertion of old 
   (duplicated) data into the ULE Stream (i.e. replay protection). 
   This set of features is optional to reduce encapsulation overhead 
   when not required. 

   ULE Stream security between a ULE Encapsulation Gateway and the 
   corresponding Receiver(s) is considered an additional security 
   mechanism to IPsec, TLS, and application layer end-to-end 
   security, and not as a replacement. It allows a network operator 
   to provide similar functions to that of IPsec, but in addition 
   provides MPEG-2 transmission link confidentiality and protection 
   of ULE Receiver identity (NPA address). 

   Appendix A describes a set of building blocks that may be used to 
   realise a framework that provides ULE security functions. 

8. Security Considerations 

   Link-layer (L2) encryption of IP traffic is commonly used in 
   broadcast/radio links to supplement end-to-end security (e.g. 
   provided by TLS [RFC4346], SSH [RFC4251], IPsec [RFC4301]). 

   A common objective is to provide the same level of privacy as 
   wired links. It is recommended that an ISP or user provide end-
   to-end security services based on well known mechanisms such as

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   IPsec or TLS. 

   This document provides a threat analysis and derives the security 
   requirements to provide link encryption and optional link-layer 
   integrity / authentication of the SNDU payload. 

   There are some security issues that were raised in RFC 4326 
   [RFC4326] that are not addressed in this document (i.e. are out 
   of scope), e.g.: 

   o The security issue with un-initialised stuffing bytes. In ULE, 
      these bytes are set to 0xFF (normal practice in MPEG-2). 

   o Integrity issues related to the removal of the LAN FCS in a 
      bridged networking environment. The removal for bridged frames 
      exposes the traffic to potentially undetected corruption while 
      being processed by the Encapsulator and/or Receiver. 

   o There is a potential security issue when a Receiver receives a 
      PDU with two Length fields: The Receiver would need to 
      validate the actual length and the Length field and ensure 
      that inconsistent values are not propagated by the network. 

9. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA actions defined in this document.

Appendix A: ULE Security Framework 

   This section describes a security framework for the deployment of 
   secure ULE networks. 

   A.1 Building Blocks 

   This ULE Security framework describes the following building 
   blocks as shown in figure 2 below: 

   o The Key Management Block 

   o The ULE Security Extension Header Block 

   o The ULE Databases Block 

   Within the Key Management Block the communication between the 
   Group Member entity and the Group Server entity happens in the 
   control plane. The ULE Security Header Block applies security to 
   the ULE SNDU and this happens in the ULE data plane. The ULE 
   Security Databases Block acts as the interface between the Key 
   Management Block (control plane) and the ULE Security Header 
   Block (ULE data plane) as shown in figure 2. The Security 
   Databases Block exists in both the group member and server sides. 
   However, it has been omitted from figure 2 just for clarity.

   A.1.1 Key Management Block 

   A key management framework is required to provide security at the 
   ULE level using extension headers. This key management framework 
   is responsible for user authentication, access control, and 
   Security Association negotiation (which include the negotiations 
   of the security algorithms to be used and the generation of the 
   different session keys as well as policy material). The key 
   management framework can be either automated or manual. Hence 
   this key management client entity (shown as the Key Management 
   Group Member Block in figure 2) will be present in all ULE 
   Receivers as well as at the ULE Encapsulators. The ULE 
   Encapsulator could also be the Key Management Group Server Entity 
   (shown as the Key Management Group Server Block in figure 2).

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   This happens when the ULE Encapsulator also acts as the Key 
   Management Group Server. Deployment may use either automated key 
   management protocols (e.g. GSAKMP [RFC4535]) or manual insertion 
   of keying material.  

   A.1.2 ULE Security Databases Block 

   There needs to be two databases, i.e. similar to the IPsec 
   databases.  

   o ULE-SAD: ULE Security Association Database contains all the 
      Security Associations that are currently established with 
      different ULE peers. 

   o ULE-SPD: ULE Security Policy Database contains the policies as 
      described by the system manager. These policies describe the 
      security services that must be enforced. 

   The design of these two databases may be based on IPsec databases 
   as defined in RFC4301 [RFC4301].  

   The exact details of the header patterns that the SPD and SAD 
   will have to support for all use cases will be described in a 
   separate document. This document only highlights the need for 
   such interfaces between the ULE data plane and the Key Management 
   control plane. 

   A.1.3 ULE Extension Header Block 

   A new security extension header for the ULE protocol is required 
   to provide the security features of data confidentiality, 
   identity protection, data integrity, data authentication, and 
   mechanisms to prevent replay attacks. Security keying material 
   will be used for the different security algorithms (for 
   encryption/decryption, MAC generation, etc.), which are used to 
   meet the security requirements, described in detail in Section 4 
   of this document. 

   This block will use the keying material and policy information 
   from the ULE Security Database Block on the ULE payload to 
   generate the secure ULE Extension Header or to decipher the 
   secure ULE extension header to get the ULE payload. An example 
   overview of the ULE Security extension header format along with 
   the ULE header and payload is shown in figure 3 below.

   A.2 Interface definition 

   Two new interfaces have to be defined between the blocks as shown 
   in Figure 2 above. These interfaces are: 

   o Key Management Block <-> ULE Security Databases Block  

   o ULE Security Databases Block <-> ULE Security Header Block 

   While the first interface is used by the Key Management Block to 
   insert keys, security associations and policies into the ULE 
   Database Block, the second interface is used by the ULE Security 
   Extension Header Block to get the keys and policy material for 
   generation of the security extension header. 

   A.2.1 Key Management <-> ULE Security databases 

   This interface is between the Key Management Block of a group 
   member (GM client) and the ULE Security Database Block (shown in 
   figure 2). The Key Management GM entity will communicate with the 
   GCKS and then get the relevant security information (keys, cipher 
   mode, security service, ULE_Security_ID and other relevant keying 
   material as well as policy) and insert this data into the ULE 
   Security Database Block. The Key Management could be either 
   automated (e.g. GSAKMP [RFC4535] or GDOI [RFC3547]), or security 
   information could be manually inserted using this interface. 

   Examples of interface functions are: 

   o Insert_record_database (char * Database, char * record, char * 
      Unique_ID); 

   o Update_record_database (char * Database, char * record, char * 
      Unique_ID); 

   o Delete_record_database (char * Database, char * Unique_ID); 

   The definitions of the variables are as follows: 

   o Database - This is a pointer to the ULE Security databases

   o record - This is the rows of security attributes to be entered 
      or modified in the above databases 

   o Unique_ID - This is the primary key to lookup records (rows of 
      security attributes) in the above databases 

   A.2.2 ULE Security Databases <-> ULE Security Header 

   This interface is between the ULE Security Database and the ULE 
   Security Extension Header Block as shown in figure 2. When 
   sending traffic, the ULE encapsulator uses the Destination 
   Address, the PID, and possibly other information such as L3 
   source and destination addresses to locate the relevant security 
   record within the ULE Security Database. It then uses the data in 
   the record to create the ULE security extension header. For 
   received traffic, the ULE decapsulator on receiving the ULE SNDU 
   will use the Destination Address, the PID, and a ULE Security ID 
   inserted by the ULE encapsulator into the security extension to 
   retrieve the relevant record from the Security Database. It then 
   uses this information to decrypt the ULE extension header. For 
   both cases (either send or receive traffic) only one interface is 
   needed since the main difference between the sender and receiver 
   is the direction of the flow of traffic. An example of such 
   interface is as follows: 

   o Get_record_database (char * Database, char * record, char * 
      Unique_ID); 

Appendix B: Motivation for ULE link-layer security 

   Examination of the threat analysis and security requirements in 
   sections 3 and 4 has shown that there is a need to provide 
   security in MPEG-2 transmission networks employing ULE. This 
   section compares the placement of security functionalities in 
   different layers. 

   B.1 Security at the IP layer (using IPsec) 

   The security architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC4301] 
   describes security services for traffic at the IP layer. This 
   architecture primarily defines services for the Internet Protocol 
   (IP) unicast packets, as well as manually configured IP multicast 
   packets.  

   It is possible to use IPsec to secure ULE Streams. The major 
   advantage of IPsec is its wide implementation in IP routers and 
   hosts. IPsec in transport mode can be used for end-to-end 
 
 
Cruickshank et.al.     Expires February 22, 2009          [Page 24] 

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   security transparently over MPEG-2 transmission links with little 
   impact.  

   In the context of MPEG-2 transmission links, if IPsec is used to 
   secure a ULE Stream, then the ULE Encapsulator and Receivers are 
   equivalent to the security gateways in IPsec terminology. A 
   security gateway implementation of IPsec uses tunnel mode. Such 
   usage has the following disadvantages: 

   o There is an extra transmission overhead associated with using 
      IPsec in tunnel mode, i.e. the extra IP header (IPv4 or IPv6). 

   o There is a need to protect the identity (NPA address) of ULE 
      Receivers over the ULE broadcast medium; IPsec is not suitable 
      for providing this service. In addition, the interfaces of 
      these devices do not necessarily have IP addresses (they can 
      be L2 devices). 

   o Multicast is considered a major service over ULE links. The 
      current IPsec specifications [RFC4301] only define a pairwise 
      tunnel between two IPsec devices with manual keying. Work is 
      in progress in defining the extra detail needed for multicast 
      and to use the tunnel mode with address preservation to allow 
      efficient multicasting. For further details refer to [WEIS08]. 

   B.2 Link security below the encapsulation layer  

   Link layer security can be provided at the MPEG-2 TS layer (below 
   ULE). MPEG-2 TS encryption encrypts all TS Packets sent with a 
   specific PID value. However, an MPEG-2 TS may typically multiplex 
   several IP flows, belonging to different users, using a common 
   PID. Therefore all multiplexed traffic will share the same 
   security keys.  

   This has the following advantages: 

   o The bit stream sent on the broadcast network does not expose 
      any L2 or L3 headers, specifically all addresses, type fields, 
      and length fields are encrypted prior to transmission.  

   o This method does not preclude the use of IPsec, TLS, or any 
      other form of higher-layer security.  

   However it has the following disadvantages:  



 
 
Cruickshank et.al.     Expires February 22, 2009          [Page 25] 

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   o When a PID is shared between several users, each ULE Receiver 
      needs to decrypt all MPEG-2 TS Packets with a matching PID, 
      possibly including those that are not required to be 
      forwarded. Therefore it does not have the flexibility to 
      separately secure individual IP flows.  

   o When a PID is shared between several users, the ULE Receivers 
      will have access to private traffic destined to other ULE 
      Receivers, since they share a common PID and key.  

   o IETF-based key management that is very flexible and secure is 
      not used in existing MPEG-2 based systems. Existing access 
      control mechanisms in such systems have limited flexibility in 
      terms of controlling the use of key and rekeying. Therefore if 
      the key is compromised, then this will impact several ULE 
      Receivers.  

   Currently there are few deployed L2 security systems for MPEG-2 
   transmission networks. Conditional access for digital TV 
   broadcasting is one example. However, this approach is optimised 
   for TV services and is not well-suited to IP packet transmission. 
   Some other systems are specified in standards such as MPE [ETSI-
   DAT], but there are currently no known implementations and these 
   methods are not applicable to GSE. 

   B.3 Link security as a part of the encapsulation layer  

   Examining the threat analysis in section 3 has shown that 
   protection of ULE Stream from eavesdropping and ULE Receiver 
   identity are major requirements.  

   There are several advantages in using ULE link layer security: 

   o The protection of the complete ULE Protocol Data Unit (PDU) 
      including IP addresses. The protection can be applied either 
      per IP flow or per Receiver NPA address.  

   o Ability to protect the identity of the Receiver within the 
      MPEG-2 transmission network at the IP layer and also at L2. 

   o Efficient protection of IP multicast over ULE links.  

   o Transparency to the use of Network Address Translation (NATs) 
      [RFC3715] and TCP Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEP) 
      [RFC3135], which require the ability to inspect and modify the 
      packets sent over the ULE link.

Internet-Draft       Security Requirements for ULE       August 2008 
    

   This method does not preclude the use of IPsec at L3 (or TLS 
   [RFC4346] at L4). IPsec and TLS provide strong authentication of 
   the end-points in the communication.  

   L3 end-to-end security would partially deny the advantage listed 
   above (use of PEP, compression, etc.), since those techniques 
   could only be applied to TCP packets bearing a TCP-encapsulated 
   IPsec packet exchange, but not the TCP packets of the original 
   applications, which in particular inhibits compression. 

   End-to-end security (IPsec, TLS, etc.) may be used independently 
   to provide strong authentication of the end-points in the 
   communication. This authentication is desirable in many scenarios 
   to ensure that the correct information is being exchanged between 
   the trusted parties, whereas Layer 2 methods cannot provide this 
   guarantee.
