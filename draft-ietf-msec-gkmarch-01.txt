Abstract

This document presents a group key-management architecture for MSEC.
The purpose of this document is to define the common architecture for 
MSEC group key-management protocols that support a variety of 
application, transport, and internetwork security protocols.  To 
address these diverse uses, MSEC may need to standardize two or more 
group key management protocols that have common requirements, 
abstractions, overall design, and messages. The framework and 
guidelines in this document allow for a modular and flexible design 
of group key management protocols for a variety different settings 
that are specialized to application needs.

1.0 Introduction: Purpose of this Document

Group and multicast applications have diverse requirements in IP 
networks [CP00].  Their key-management requirements, which are 
briefly reviewed below (see "Requirements"), include support for 
internetwork, transport, and application-layer protocols.  In 
particular, while Internet-standard ISAKMP and IKE protocols purport 
to manage keys for any and all services in a host, some applications 
may achieve simpler operation by running key-management messaging 
over TLS or IPsec security services.  For these reasons, application, 
transport, and internetwork-layer security protocols such as SRTP, 
IPsec, and AMESP may benefit from using different group key 
management systems. Some security protocols will benefit from a key 
management protocol that can run over IPsec or TLS [GSAKMP].  Other 
security protocols may run over SIP or RTSP [KMMS]. Extensions to IKE 
may be the best solution for running IPsec protocols over IP 
multicast services [GDOI].  The purpose of this document is to define 
a common architecture and design for these different group key-
management protocols for internet, transport, and application 
services.

Indeed, key-management protocols are difficult to design and 
validate.  The common architecture described in this document eases 
this burden by defining common abstractions and overall design that 
can be specialized for different uses.

This document builds on and extends the Group Key Management Building 
Block document of the IRTF SMuG research group [HBH01] and is part of 
the MSEC document roadmap. To correctly place the current document in 
the context of the MSEC literature we include a copy of the MSEC 
draft tree in the appendix.

Section 2 discusses the security, performance and architectural 
requirements for a group key management protocol. Section 3 presents 
the overall architectural design. Section 4 specifies the interface 
to the Group Security Association (GSA) using the standard keywords 
of RFC 2119. Section 5 discusses scalability issues and Section 6 
discusses Security Considerations. 
2.0 Requirements for a group key management protocol

A group key management protocol supports multicast applications that 
need a secure group.  A "secure group" is a collection of principals, 
called "members," who may be senders, receivers or both receivers and 
senders to other members of the group. (Note that group membership 
may vary over time.) A "group key management protocol" helps to 
ensure that only members of a secure group gain access to group data 
(by gaining access to group keys) and can authenticate group data.  
The goal of a group key management protocol is to provide legitimate 
group members with the up-to-date cryptographic state they need for 
their secrecy and authenticity requirements. 

Multicast applications, such as video broadcast and multicast file 
transfer, have the following key-management requirements (see also 
[CP00]).

1. The group members must receive "security associations" including 
   encryption keys, authentication/integrity keys, cryptographic 
   policy that describes the keys, and attributes such as 
   an index for referencing the security association.
2. Keys will have a predetermined lifetime and will be periodically 
   refreshed.
3. Key material must be delivered securely to members of the
   group so that they are secret and authenticated to group members
   during the key lifetime and refreshed securely at the end of
   the key lifetime.
4. The key-management protocol must be secure against man-in-the-
   middle, connection-hijacking, and reflection/replay attacks; it 
   must use best-known practices to thwart denial-of-service attacks 
   (see Security Considerations section of this memo).
5. It must be possible to add and remove group members so that  
   members who are added may optionally be denied access to the key 
   material used before they joined the group, and that members who 
   are removed lose access to the key material following their 
   departure.
6. It must be possible to provide re-key for the group without
   requiring unicast exchange between a group controller/key server    
   (GCKS) and individual members, which would overwhelm a GCKS when 
   the group is large.
7. The key management protocol must be suitable for IPsec security
   protocols, AH and ESP, and/or application-layer security protocols
   such as AMESP and SRTP.
8. The key management protocol should allow keys and algorithms to be 
   renewed and the authorization infrastructure and authentication 
   systems to be replaced.

Although it is not a requirement for a multicast security protocol, 
the group key management protocol may also be useful to unicast 
applications that share many of the requirements of multicast 
applications, such as for Internet entertainment applications that 
exhibit a high degree of synchronization among receivers.  For 
example, consider a video on demand application scenario where the 
top 10 movies are offered.  On a Friday night, a large population of 
users is likely to request any one of the small set of movies (files 
or streams) and place great demand on the GCKS for keys to the pre-
encrypted data.  If asymmetric cryptography is used to establish 
security associations as is done in TLS or IKE, the GCKS will 
probably not be able to exceed 20-60 key management sessions per 
second (on a 500 MHz Pentium-class server with RSA, DSS, or EC-DSS 
keys ranging from about 160 to 1024 bits in length).  If the video-
on-demand community of users is modeled as a group, however, then a 
key management implementation that supports requirement 6, above, 
will satisfy the requirements of the VOD application as well.

There are other requirements for small group operation where there 
will be many senders or in which all members may potentially be 
senders.  In this case, the group setup time may need to be optimized 
to support a small, highly interactive group environment [RFC2627].  
A single group controller (or GCKS) may not be the best design for 
small, interactive groups.  But for large, single-source multicast 
groups, it is generally undesirable to distribute key management 
functions among group members: Unlike small, interactive groups, 
large single-source multicast groups generally need a specialized 
GCKS to support large numbers of group members.  Large distributed 
simulations, moreover, may combine the need for large-group operation 
with many senders.

We take as a basic requirement the support of large single-sender 
groups, such as source-specific (single-source) multicast groups.  
Thus, group key management should support high-capacity operation to 
large groups that have one or very few senders.  Nonetheless, 
scalable operation to a range of group sizes is a desirable feature, 
and a better group key management protocol will support large, 
single-sender groups as well as groups that have many senders. It may 
be that no single key management protocol can satisfy the scalability 
requirements of all group-security applications.   In this case, this 
architecture allows two or more key management protocols, where each 
protocol is suitable to a different scenario such large single-source 
groups or small interactive groups.

In addition to these requirements, it is useful to emphasize two non-
requirements, namely, technical protection measures (TPM) and 
broadcast key management.  TPM are used for such things as copy 
protection by preventing the user of a device to get easy access to 
the group keys. Although we should expect that a device under the 
control of an attacker would lose its secrets to that attacker, some 
TPM advocates see tamper-resistant technologies as a means to keep 
honest people honest [MT] and want TPM for that purpose.  There is no 
reason why a group key management protocol cannot be used in an 
environment where the keys are kept in a "tamper-resistant" store 
using various types of hardware or software to implement TPM.  The 
group key management architecture described in this document, 
however, is for key management protocols and not a design for 
technical protection measures, which are outside the scope of this 
document.

The second non-requirement is broadcast key management where there is 
no back channel [FN93, JKKV94] or the device is not on a network, 
such as a digital videodisk player.  We assume IP network operation 
where there is two-way communication, however asymmetric, and that 
authenticated key-exchange procedures can be used for member 
registration.  It is possible that broadcast applications can make 
use of a one-way Internet group key management protocol message, and 
a one-way Re-key message is described below.
3.0 Overall Design

This section describes the overall structure of a group key 
management protocol, and provides a reference implementation diagram 
for group key management.  This design is based upon a "group 
controller" model [RFC2093, RFC2094, RFC2627, OFT, GSAKMP, GDOI] with 
a single group owner as the root-of-trust.  The group owner 
designates a group controller for member registration and re-key.
3.1 Overview

The main goal of a group key management protocol is to provide the 
group members with an up-to-date security association (SA), which 
contains the needed information for securing group communication 
(i.e., the group data). We call this SA the "Data Security Protocol 
SA", or "Data SA" for short. In order to obtain this goal, the Group 
Key Management Architecture consists of the following protocols.

  (1) Registration protocol.
      =====================
  This is a two-way unicast protocol between the group controller/key 
server (GCKS) and a joining group member. In this protocol the GCKS 
and joining member mutually authenticate each other. If the 
authentication succeeds and the GCKS finds that the joining member is 
authorized, then the GCKS supplies the joining member with the 
following information:

    (a) Sufficient information to initialize a "Re-key Protocol SA" 
within the joining member (see more details about this SA  below). 
This information is given only in case that the group security policy 
calls for using a Re-key protocol.
    (b) Sufficient information to initialize the Data Security 
Protocol SA within the joining member. This information is given only 
in the case that the group security policy calls for initializing the 
Data Security Protocol SA at Registration, instead of or in addition 
to at Re-key.

  The Registration Protocol must ensure that the transfer of 
information from GCKS to member is done in an authenticated and 
confidential manner over a security association.  We call this SA the 
"Registration Protocol SA".

  (2) Re-key protocol.
      ================
  This is an optional protocol where the GCKS periodically sends re-
key information to the group members. Re-key messages may result from 
group membership changes, the creation of new traffic-encrypting keys 
(TEKs, see next section) for the particular Group, or from key 
expiration. Re-key messages are protected by the Re-key protocol SA, 
which is initialized in the Registration protocol. The Re-key message 
includes information for updating both the Re-key protocol SA and/or 
the Data Security Protocol SA.  The Re-key messages can be sent 
multicast to group members or unicast from the GCKS to a particular 
group member.

The Re-key protocol is optional as there are other means for managing 
(e.g. expiring or refreshing) the keys locally without interaction 
between the GCKS and member [MARKS].  When Re-key is used, it MUST 
include authentication data for the re-key.  There are two cases.  

 o The first and primary option is to use source authentication.
   That is, each group member MUST verify that Re-key data 
   originates with the GCKS and none other.

 o The second option is to use only group-based authentication using 
   a symmetric key, such as a message authentication code.  Members
   can only be assured that the Re-key messages originated within
   the group.  Therefore, this is applicable only when all members 
   of the group are trusted not to impersonate the GCKS.  Group  
   authentication for Re-key messages is typically used when public-
   key cryptography is not suitable for the particular group.

The Re-key protocol SHOULD ensure that all members receive the re-key 
information in a timely manner. In addition, the Re-key protocol 
SHOULD specify mechanisms for the parties to contact the GCKS and 
"re-synch" in case that their keys expired and an updated key has not 
yet been received.  The Re-key protocol must be able to avoid 
implosion problems and ensure the needed reliability in its delivery 
of keying material.

The Re-key message is protected by a Re-key SA, which may be 
established by the Registration Protocol.  The Re-key SA, one or more 
Data SAs, and the Registration SA SHOULD be destroyed by a member who 
leaves the particular Group to which these SAs belong. Alternatively, 
a member MAY allow the SAs to expire.  A particular group key 
management protocol MAY provide a De-Registration message to inform 
the GCKS that it has destroyed it SAs, or is about to destroy them.  
Such a message may prompt the GCKS to cryptographically remove the 
member from the group (i.e., to prevent the member from having access 
to future group communication). In large-scale multicast 
applications, however, De-registration has the potential to cause 
implosion at the GCKS.  A De-registration message is not specified in 
this document.
3.2 Detailed description

Figure 1 depicts the overall design [HBH01].  Each group member, 
sender or receiver, MAY use the Registration Protocol to get 
authorized, authenticated access to a particular Group, its policies, 
and its keys. The two types of group keys are the KEK (key-encrypting 
key) and the TEK (traffic-encrypting key).  The KEK may be a single 
key that encrypts the TEK or it may be a vector of keys in a key 
revocation algorithm [RFC2627, OFT, CP00, LNN01] that encrypts the 
TEK and other KEKs.  The KEK is used by the Re-key protocol.  The TEK 
is used by the Data Security Protocol to protect streams, files, or 
other data sent and received by the Data Security Protocol.  Thus the 
Registration Protocol and/or the Re-key Protocol establish the KEK 
and TEK.
 There are a few, distinct outcomes to a successful Registration
Protocol exchange.
     o If the GCKS uses Re-key messages, then the admitted member
       receives the Group KEK; if it uses a key revocation
       algorithm, then the member receives a set of KEKs according to
       the particular algorithm.
     o If Re-key messages are not used for the Group, then the
       admitted member will receive TEKs (in SAs) that are passed to 
       the member's Data Security Protocol as IKE does for IPsec.
     o The GCKS may pass one or more TEKS to the member even if Re-
       key messages are used, for efficiency reasons according to 
       group policy.

FIGURE 1: Group Security Association Model

The GCKS creates the KEK and TEKs and downloads them to each member - 
as the KEK and TEKs are common to the entire Group.  The GCKS is a 
separate, logical entity that performs member authentication and 
authorization according to the Group policy that is set by the Group 
Owner.  The GCKS MAY present a credential to the Group member that is 
signed by the Group Owner so the member can check the GCKS's 
authorization.  The GCKS, which may be co-located with a member or be 
a separate physical entity, MAY run the Re-key Protocol to push Re-
key messages of refreshed KEKs, new TEKs, and refreshed TEKs to 
members.  Alternatively, the sender may forward Re-key messages on 
behalf of the GCKS when it uses a credential mechanism that supports 
delegation. Thus, it is possible for the sender or other member to 
source keying material (a TEK encrypted in the Group KEK) as it 
sources multicast or unicast data.  As mentioned above, the Re-key 
message can be sent using unicast or multicast delivery.  Upon 
receipt of a TEK from a Re-key Message or a Registration protocol 
exchange, the member's group key management will provide a security 
association (SA) to a Data Security Protocol for the data sent from 
sender to receiver.

The "Security Protocol SA" protects the data sent on the arc labeled
"DATA SECURITY PROTOCOL" in Figure 1.  A second SA, the "Re-key
SA," is optionally established by the key-management protocol for Re-
key messages, and the arc labeled "RE-KEY PROTOCOL" in Figure 1 
depicts this.  The Re-key message is optional because all keys, KEK 
and TEKs, can be delivered by the Registration Protocol exchanges 
shown in Figure 1, and those keys may not need to be updated.  The 
Registration Protocol is protected by a third, symmetric, unicast SA 
between the GCKS and each member; this is called the "Registration 
Protocol SA."  There may be no need for the Registration Protocol SA 
to remain in place after the completion of the Registration Protocol 
exchanges.  The three SAs comprise the Group Security Association.  
Only one SA is optional and that is the Re-key SA. 

Figure 1 shows two blocks that are external to the group key 
management protocol:  The Policy and Authorization Infrastructures 
are discussed in Section 4.1.
3.3 Properties of the design

The design of Section 3.2 achieves scalable operation by (1) allowing 
the de-coupling of authenticated key exchange in a "Registration 
Protocol" from a "Re-key Protocol," (2) allowing the Re-key Protocol 
to use unicast push or multicast distribution of group and data keys 
as an option, and (3) allowing all keys to be obtained by the unicast 
Registration Protocol.  The GCKS functionality, moreover, can be 
delegated when the authorization infrastructure supports delegation 
to permit distributed operation of the GCKS.

High-capacity operation is obtained by (1) amortizing 
computationally-expensive asymmetric cryptography over multiple data 
keys used by data security protocols, (2) supporting unicast push or 
multicast distribution of symmetric group and data keys, and (3) 
supporting key revocation algorithms such as LKH [RFC2627, OFT, 
LNN01] that allow members to be added or removed at logarithmic 
rather than linear space/time complexity.  The Registration protocol 
often uses asymmetric cryptography to authenticate joining members 
and optionally establish the group KEK.  Asymmetric cryptography such 
as Diffie-Hellman key agreement and/or digital signatures are 
amortized over the life of the group KEK:  A TEK SA can be 
established without the use of asymmetric cryptography - the TEK is 
simply encrypted in the symmetric KEK and sent unicast or multicast 
in the Re-key protocol.  

The design of the Registration and Re-key Protocols is flexible. The 
Registration protocol establishes one KEK or multiple TEKs or both 
KEK and TEKs.  The TEK (or "data key") is associated with a data 
security protocol SA; there may in fact be multiple keys pushed with 
or derived from the TEK.  The Re-key Protocol establishes KEKs or 
TEKs or both.  
3.4 Implementation Diagram

In the block diagram of Figure 2, group key management protocols run 
between a GCKS and member principals to establish a Group Security 
Association (GSA) consisting of a Security Protocol SA, an optional 
Re-key SA, and a Registration Protocol SA.  The GCKS MAY use a 
delegated principal, such as an SRTP [SRTP] sender, which has a 
delegation credential signed by the GCKS.  The "Member" of Figure 2 
may be a sender or receiver of multicast or unicast data [HCBD].  
There are two functional blocks in Figure 2 labeled "GKM," and there 
are two arcs between them depicting the group key-management 
Registration ("reg") and Re-key ("rek") protocols.  The message 
exchanges are the GSA establishment protocols, which are the 
Registration Protocol and the Re-key Protocol described above.

   Figure 2: Group key management block diagram for a host computer

Figure 2 shows that a complete group-key management functional 
specification includes much more than the message exchange.  Some of 
these functional blocks and the arcs between them are peculiar to an 
operating system (OS) or vendor product, such as vendor 
specifications for products that support updates to the IPsec 
Security Association Database (SAD) and Security Policy Database 
(SPD) [RFC2367].  Various vendors also define the functions and 
interface of credential stores, "CRED" in Figure 2.  AUTHORIZATION is 
subject to Group Policy [HH], but how this is done is specific to the 
GCKS implementation.

Beside the AUTHORIZATION block in Figure 2, there is an ANNOUNCEMENT 
block. The announcement function is needed to inform a potential 
group member that it may join a group or receive group data (e.g. a 
stream of file transfer protected by a Data Security protocol).  
Announcements notify group members to establish multicast SAs in 
advance of secure multicast data transmission.  Session Description 
Protocol (SDP) is one form that the announcements might take 
[RFC2327].  The announcement function may be implemented in a 
session-directory tool, an electronic program guide (EPG), or by 
other means.  The Data Security or the announcement function directs 
group key management using an application-programming interface 
(API), which is peculiar to the host OS in its specifics.  A generic 
API for group key management is for further study, but this function 
is necessary to allow Group (KEK) and Data (TEK) key establishment to 
be done in a way that is scalable to the particular application.  A 
GCKS application program will use the API to initiate the procedures 
to establish SAs on behalf of a Security Protocol in which members 
join secure groups and receive keys for streams, files or other data.

The goal of the exchanges is to establish a GSA through updates to 
the SAD of a key-management implementation and particular Security
Protocol.  The "Security Protocol" of Figure 2 may span internetwork 
and application layers [AMESP] or operate at the internetwork layer, 
such as AH and ESP.
4.0 Group Security Association

The GKM Architecture defines the interfaces between the Registration, 
Re-key, and Data Security protocols in terms of the Security 
Associations (SAs) of those protocols.  By isolating these protocols 
behind a uniform interface, our architecture allows implementations 
to use protocols best suited to their needs.  For example, a Re-key 
protocol for a small group could use multiple unicast transmissions 
with symmetric authentication, while that for a large group could use 
IP Multicast with packet-level Forward Error Correction and source 
authentication.

The Group Key Management Architecture provides an interface between 
the security protocols and the group SA (GSA), which consists of 
three SAs, viz., Registration SA, Re-key SA and Data SA.  The Re-key 
SA is optional.  There are two cases in defining the relationships 
between the three SAs.  In both cases, the Registration SA protects 
the Registration protocol.

In Case 1, Group key management is done WITHOUT using a Re-key SA. 
The Registration protocol initializes and updates one or more Data 
SAs (having TEKs to protect files or streams).  Each Data SA 
corresponds to a single group û and a group may have more than one 
data SA.  

In Case 2, group key management USES a Re-key SA to protect the Re-
key protocol. The Registration protocol initializes the Re-key SAs 
(one or more) as well as zero or more Data SAs upon successful 
completion.  When a Data SA is not initialized in the Registration 
protocol, this MUST be done in the Re-key protocol.  The Re-key 
protocol updates Re-key SA(s) AND establishes Data SA(s).
4.1 Group policy

Group-policy is currently being defined [GSPT].  It will likely be 
distributed through both Announcement and Key Management protocols.  
The group key management MUST carry cryptographic policies of the SA 
keys it establishes and MAY carry additional policies for the group 
as well.

The acceptable cryptographic policies for the Registration Protocol, 
which may run over TLS, IPsec, or IKE, are not conveyed in the group 
key-management protocol since they precede any of the key management 
exchanges.  Thus, a security policy repository having some access 
protocol may need to be queried prior to key-management session 
establishment to determine what the initial cryptographic policies
are for that establishment.  This document assumes the existence of
such a repository and protocol for GCKS and member policy queries.
Thus group security policy will be represented in a policy repository
and accessible using a policy protocol.

This memo assumes that at least the following group-policy 
information is
externally managed.
  o Group owner, authentication method, and delegation method for 
    identifying a GCKS for the group
  o Group GCKS, authentication method, and any method used for
    delegating other GCKSs for the group
  o Group membership rules or list and authentication method

There are also two additional policy-related requirements external to 
group key management.

  o There is an authorization and authentication infrastructure such
    as X.509, SPKI, or pre-shared key scheme in accordance with the
    group policy for a particular group.
  o There is an announcement mechanism for secure groups and events
    that operates according to group policy for a particular group.

Group policy determines how the Registration and Re-key protocols 
initialize or update Re-key and Data SAs.  The following sections 
describe the information that are sent by the GCKS for the Re-key and 
Data SAs.  A member needs to have the information specified in the 
next sections to establish Re-key and Data SAs.
4.2 Contents of the Re-key SA

The Re-key SA protects the Re-key protocol.  It contains 
cryptographic policy, Security Parameter Index (SPI) [RFC2401] to 
uniquely identify an SA, replay protection information, and secret 
keys.

4.2.1 Re-key SA policy

The MEMBERSHIP MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM represents the group key 
revocation algorithm that enforces forward and backward access 
control.  Examples of key revocation algorithms include LKH, LKH+, 
OFT, OFC and Subset Difference [RFC2627, OFT, CP00, LNN01].  The key 
revocation algorithm could also be NULL.  In that case, the Re-key SA 
contains only one KEK, which serves as the group KEK.  The Re-key 
messages initialize or update Data SAs as usual.  But, the Re-key SA 
itself can be updated (group KEK can be re-keyed) when members join 
or the KEK is about to expire.  Leave re-keying is done by re-
initializing the Re-key SA through the Re-key Protocol.

The KEK ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM MUST use a standard encryption algorithm 
such as 3DES or AES.  The KEK KEY LENGTH MUST also be specified.

The AUTHENTICATION ALGORITHM SHOULD use digital signatures for GCKS 
authentication (since all shared secrets are known to some or all 
members of the group), or it MAY use a symmetric secret in computing 
MACs for group authentication, which provides weaker authentication 
meaning that any group member can impersonate a particular source.  
The AUTHENTICATION KEY LENGTH MUST also be specified.

The CONTROL GROUP ADDRESS MUST be used for multicast transmission of 
Re-key messages.  This MAY be sent via the ANNOUNCEMENT protocol. 
However, the Group Owner MAY decide to send this information only to 
authorized members.

The REKEY SERVER ADDRESS allows the registration server to be a 
different entity from the server used for re-key, such as for future 
invocations of the Registration and Re-key protocols.  If the 
registration server and the re-key server are two different entities, 
the registration server MUST send the re-key server's address as part 
of the Re-key SA.

4.2.2 Group identity

The Group identity MUST accompany the SA (payload) information as an 
identifier if the specific group key management protocol allows 
multiple groups to be initialized in a single invocation of the 
Registration protocol or multiple groups to be updated in a single 
Re-key message.  While it MAY be much simpler to restrict each 
Registration invocation to a single group, this Group Key Management 
architecture mandates no such restriction.  There is always a need to 
identify the group when establishing a Re-key SA either implicitly 
through an SPI or explicitly as an SA parameter.

4.2.3 Key encrypting key(s)

Corresponding to the key management algorithm, the Re-key SA contains 
one or more KEKs.  The GCKS holds the key encrypting keys of the 
group, while the members receive keys following the specification of 
the key-management algorithm.  When there are multiple KEKs for a 
group (as in an LKH tree), each KEK MAY be associated with a Key ID, 
which MAY be used to identify the key needed to decrypt it.  Each KEK 
MUST have a LIFETIME associated with it, after which the KEK expires.

4.2.4 Authentication key

The GCKS MAY provide a symmetric or public key for authentication of 
its Re-key messages.  Symmetric-key authentication is appropriate 
only when all group members can be trusted not to impersonate the 
GCKS.  The architecture does not rule out methods for deriving 
symmetric authentication keys at the member [RFC2409] rather than 
being pushed from the GCKS.

4.2.5 Replay protection information

Re-key messages MUST be protected from replay/reflection attacks.  
Sequence numbers are used for this purpose and the Re-key SA (or 
protocol) contains this information.

4.2.6 Security Parameter Index (SPI)

The triple (Group identity, SPI, an identifier for "Re-key SA") 
uniquely identifies an SA.  The SPI changes each time the KEKs 
change.
4.3 Contents of the Data SA 

The GCKS specifies the Data Security protocol used for secure 
transmission of data from sender(s) to receiving members.  Examples 
of Data Security protocols include IPsec ESP, SRTP, MESP, and AMESP.  
While the content of each of these protocols is out of the scope of 
this document, we list the information sent by the Registration 
protocol (or the Re-key Protocol) to initialize or update the Data 
SA.

4.3.1 Group identity

The Group identity MUST accompany SA information when Data SAs are 
initialized or re-keyed for multiple groups in a single invocation of 
the Registration protocol or in a single Re-key message (see 4.2.2). 

4.3.2 Source identity

The Group Owner MAY choose to reveal Source identity to authorized 
members only.  Alternatively, it MAY choose the ANNOUNCEMENT protocol 
to list the Source(s) corresponding to the Source identities.  Thus 
an SA MAY include source-identity information.

4.3.3 Traffic encrypting key 

Irrespective of the Data Security Protocol used, the GCKS supplies 
the TEKs (or information to derive TEKs) used in secure data 
transmission, source and group authentication.

4.3.4 Authentication key

Depending on the data-authentication method used by the Data Security 
protocol, group key management may pass one or more keys, functions 
(e.g., TESLA), or other parameters used for authenticating streams or 
files.

4.3.5 Sequence numbers

The GCKS MAY initialize and pass sequence numbers used by the Data 
Security protocol, for replay protection.

4.3.6 Security Parameter Index (SPI)

In the event that a Data Security protocol uses an SPI, the GCKS MUST 
send that information as part of the Data SA contents.

4.3.7 Data SA policy

The Data SA parameters are specific to the Data Security Protocol but 
SHOULD include encryption algorithm and parameters, the source 
authentication algorithm and parameters, the group authentication 
algorithm and parameters, and/or replay protection information.  
Generally, specification of source or group authentication is 
mutually exclusive.
5.0 Scalability Considerations

Group communications is quite diverse.  In commercial 
teleconferencing, a multipoint control unit (MCU) may be used to 
aggregate a number of teleconferencing members into a single session; 
MCUs may be hierarchically organized as well.  A "loosely coupled" 
teleconferencing session [RFC 1889] has no central controller but is 
fully distributed and end-to-end.  Teleconferencing sessions tend to 
have at most dozens of participants whereas video broadcast, which 
uses multicast communications, and media on demand, which uses 
unicast, are large-scale groups numbering hundreds to millions of 
participants.  

As described in the Requirements section above, group key management 
must support source-specific multicast.  One-to-many (single-sender) 
applications are well suited to source-specific multicast, which tend 
to have large numbers of participants and problems with 
synchronization among the participants.  "Flash crowds" are one 
manifestation of the problem with synchronized participants who make 
concurrent request for group data with concomitant requests for 
secure group keys.  Thus, a group key management protocol designed 
for single-source multicast applications must support large-scale 
operation.  The architecture described in this paper supports large-
scale operation through the following features.

1. There is no need for a unicast exchange to provide data keys to a 
security protocol for members who have previously-registered in the 
particular group; data keys can be pushed in the Re-key protocol.

2. The Registration and Re-key protocols are separable to allow 
flexibility in how members get group secrets.  A group can use a 
smart-card based system in place of the Registration protocol, for 
example, to allow the Re-key protocol to be used with no back channel 
for broadcast applications such as television conditional access 
systems.

3. The Registration and Re-key protocols should support new keys, 
algorithms, authorization infrastructures and authentication 
mechanisms in the architecture.  When the authorization 
infrastructure supports delegation, as does X.509 and SPKI, the GCKS 
function can be distributed as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Hierarchically-organized Key Distribution

The first feature in the list allows fast keying of Data Security 
protocols when the member already belongs to the group.  While this 
is realistic for subscriber groups and customers of service providers 
who offer content events, it may be too restrictive for applications 
that allow member enrollment at the time of the event.  The recourse 
for handling member registration in the context of a "flash crowd" is 
Figure 3, which will require the use of many GCKSs to accommodate the 
load.  The Figure 3 configuration may be needed when conventional 
clustering and load-balancing solutions of a central GCKS site cannot 
meet customer requirements.  Unlike conventional caching and content-
distribution networks, however, the configuration shown in Figure 3 
has additional security ramifications for physical security of a 
GCKS.

More analysis and work needs to be done on the protocol 
instantiations of the Group Key Management architecture to determine 
how effectively and securely the architecture can operate in large-
scale environments such as source-specific multicast and video on 
demand.  Specifically, the requirements for a Figure 3 configuration 
must be determined such as the need for additional protocols between 
the GCKS designated by the Group Owner and GCKSs that have been 
delegated to serve keys on behalf of the designated GCKS.


6.0 Security Considerations

This memo describes an architecture for group key management.  This 
architecture will be instantiated in one or more group key management 
protocols, which must be protected against man-in-the-middle, 
connection hijacking, replay or reflection of past messages, and 
denial of service attacks.

Authenticated key exchange [STS, SKEME, RFC2408, RFC2412, RFC2409] 
techniques limit the effects of man-in-the-middle and connection-
hijacking attacks.  Sequence numbers and low-computation message 
authentication techniques can be effective against replay and 
reflection attacks. Cookies [RFC2522], when properly implemented, 
provide an efficient means to reduce the effects of denial of service 
attacks.

This memo does not address attacks against key management or security 
protocol implementations such as so-called "type attacks" that aim to 
disrupt an implementation by such means as buffer overflow.  The 
focus of this memo is on securing the protocol, not an implementation 
of the protocol.

While classical techniques of authenticated key exchange can be 
applied to group key management, new problems arise with the sharing 
of secrets among a group of members:  Group secrets may be disclosed 
by a member of the group and group senders may be impersonated by 
other members of the group.  Key management messages from the GCKS 
should not be authenticated using shared symmetric secrets unless all 
members of the group can be trusted not to impersonate the GCKS.  
Similarly, members who disclose group secrets undermine the security 
of the entire group. Group Owners and GCKS administrators must be 
aware of these inherent limitations of group key management.

Another limitation of group key management is policy complexity:  
Whereas peer-to-peer security policy is an intersection of the policy 
of the individual peers, a Group Owner sets group security policy 
externally in secure groups.  This document assumes there is no 
negotiation of cryptographic or other security parameters in group 
key management.  Group security policy, therefore, poses new risks to 
members who send and receive data from secure groups.  Security 
administrators, GCKS operators, and users need to determine minimal 
acceptable levels of trust, authenticity and confidentiality when 
joining secure groups.  Unfortunately, group policy is at a very 
early stage of development so little guidance is available to the 
technical community at the present time.

Given the limitations and risks of group security, the security of 
the group key management Registration protocol should be as good as 
the base protocols on which it is developed such as IKE, IPsec, TLS, 
or SSL.  The particular instantiations of this Group Key Management 
architecture must ensure that the high standards for authenticated 
key exchange are preserved in their protocol specifications, which 
will be Internet standards-track documents that are subject to 
review, analysis and testing.

The second protocol, the group key management Re-key protocol, is new 
and has unknown risks associated with it.  The source-authentication 
risks describe above are obviated by the use of public-key 
cryptography.  The use of multicast delivery may raise additional 
security issues such as reliability, implosion, and denial of service 
attacks based upon the use of multicast.  The Re-key protocol 
specification (see Appendix A for the drafts roadmap) needs to offer 
secure solutions to these problems.  Each instantiation of the Re-key 
protocol, such as the GSAKMP Re-key or the GDOI Groupkey-push 
operations, need to validate the security of their Re-key 
specifications.

Novelty and complexity are the biggest risks to group key management 
protocols.  Much more analysis and experience are needed to ensure 
that the architecture described in this document can provide a well-
articulate standard for security and risks of group key management.
