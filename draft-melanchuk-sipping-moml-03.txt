Abstract 

   The Media Objects Markup Language (MOML) is a modular and extensible 
   language to define media processing objects which execute on media 
   servers. The base language defines a set of primitive media objects 
   (called primitives) and provides tools to group primitives together 
   and specify how they interact with each other. Clients use the base 
   MOML, or extend MOML, to create precisely tailored media processing 
   objects which may be used as parts of application interactions with 
   users or conferences or to transform media flowing internal to a 
   media server. IVR is an example of an application interaction with a 
   user.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes a markup language to configure and define 
   media resource objects within a media server. The language allows the 
   definition of sophisticated and complex media processing objects 
   which may be used for application interactions with users, i.e. as 
   part of a user dialog, or as media transformation operations. Media 
   Objects Markup Language (MOML) itself does not specify a language 
   suitable for constructing complete user interfaces as does VoiceXML 
   [7]. Rather, it defines a language from which individual pieces of a 
   dialog may be specified. 

   MOML is not a standalone language but will generally be used in 
   conjunction with other languages such as the Media Sessions Markup 
   Language (MSML) [8] or protocols such as the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP). MSML is used to invoke and control many different 
   services on a media server and to manipulate the flow of media 
   streams within a media server. SIP is used to establish media 
   sessions and there are conventions to use the SIP Request-URI to 
   invoke common media server services [9]. 

   MOML has both a framework, which describes the composition of media 
   resource objects, and the definition of an initial set of primitive 
   media resource objects. The following sections describe the structure

   and usage of MOML followed by sections defining all of the MOML XML 
   elements. 

   Simple media resources and their composition into more complex 
   operations is a central concept of this specification. This concept 
   is used to precisely define the required behaviors. It is not meant 
   to imply that media servers must be implemented from the same 
   building blocks used to describe the behavior. 

2. Overview 

   MOML is an XML [4] language for composing complex media objects from 
   a vocabulary of simple media resource objects called primitives. It 
   is primarily a descriptive or declarative language to describe media 
   processing objects.  

   MOML is intended to be used in different environments. As such, the 
   language itself does not define how MOML is used. Each environment in 
   which MOML is used must define how it is used, the set of services 
   provided and the mechanism for passing information between the 
   environment and MOML. The specific mechanisms used to realize the 
   interface between MOML and its environment are platform specific. 

   This specification defines using MOML with directly with SIP. The 
   Media Session Markup Language [8] is an example of another 
   environment which uses MOML. 

   MOML may be used to simply expose primitive media resource objects 
   but will be used more often to describe dialog operations and media 
   transformation objects which can be controlled via user interaction. 

   MOML does not contain any computation or flow control constructs. 
   There are no results automatically generated when media operations 
   complete. Results must be explicitly requested using a <send> or 
   <exit> element within the definition of the MOML object.  

2.1 Primitives 

   Primitives perform a single function on a media stream such as 
   generating audio, recognizing speech or DTMF, or adjusting the gain. 
   They may be composed so that primitives execute concurrently. 
   Primitives not composed for concurrent execution simply execute 
   sequentially in the order they occur in a MOML document. All 
   concurrently executing primitives in the same MOML object (defined in 
   one MOML document) can interact with each other through events. 

   Currently all primitives use audio media but primitives for text and 
   video will be defined in a future version of this specification.

   Primitives can roughly be considered to fall into one of three 
   descriptive categories.  

      o  recognizers have a media input but no output. They allow 
         different things within a media stream to be recognized or 
         detected and for events to be generated based upon received 
         media.  

      o  transformers have one media input and output and may send and 
         receive events; 

      o  sources and sinks generate or consume media. They have either a 
         media input or a media output but not both. They may receive 
         and generate events.  

   Primitives may define different media processing behavior (states) 
   based upon the events which they receive. Primitives which support 
   different processing states must define their default starting state 
   and should support the "initial" attribute to allow that state to be 
   specified when the primitive is instantiated. All primitives must 
   support the "terminate" event class. 

   The following types of primitives are defined within this 
   specification: 

               Recognizers      Transformers      Source/Sink 
               ---------------------------------------------- 
                  dtmf              agc               play 
                 faxtone           clamp             record 
                 speech             gain             dtmfgen 
                   vad              gate             faxsend 
                                   relay              faxrcv 

   Primitives have shadow variables, similar to those within VoiceXML 
   [7], which are automatically assigned values when the primitives are 
   used. Upon initialization of a MOML context, all shadow variables 
   have the string value "undefined". Each primitive has its own 
   instance of shadow variables which are global in scope to the entire 
   MOML context.  

   Names may be assigned to individual primitives when more than one 
   primitive of the same type is used within one MOML document. Shadow 
   variables are overwritten if the primitive has not been named and is 
   instantiated a second time.  

   Shadow variables cannot be modified under user control. They may be 
   returned from the MOML context using the <send> element.

2.2 Groups 

   Primitives are composed for concurrent execution by placing them 
   within a <group> element. Groups define how media flows between 
   multiple concurrently executing primitives. They have one or more 
   inputs and one or more outputs. A <group> represents the declaration 
   of a complex media processing operation. The event interaction 
   between primitives (see the following sub-section) is defined within 
   the context of one or more groups. However groups themselves do not 
   scope events, they simply define that primitives are concurrently 
   executing and a primitive must be executing in order to receive an 
   event. 

   Groups may be used to describe dialog commands, such as a 
   play/collect or play/record. They may also be used to describe media 
   objects which transform a media stream while optionally allowing 
   application or user control of the transformation. For example a gain 
   control could be defined which responds to user speech or DTMF input. 
   In this case a recognition primitive would send events to a gain 
   control primitive. 

   Groups have one attribute which defines the media flow within them. 
   They also have a dimension which defines how many media inputs and 
   outputs they have. Currently dimensions of 1 and 2 are supported 
   based upon the group topology. These correspond to a group with one 
   input and one output and a group with two inputs and two outputs.  

   Media flow to and from the primitives within the group is based upon 
   a topology attribute of the <group> element. This differs from a 
   similar mechanism in Media Policy Manipulation in the Conference 
   Policy Control Protocol [3] which explicitly defined connections. The 
   topology attribute defines a topology schema and implies the group 
   dimension.  

   There are several common ways in which primitives are often connected 
   together. A schema provides a convenient template which can be 
   applied to multiple primitives without having to define all of the 
   individual media relationships. The following two schemas are 
   initially defined for 1 dimensional groups: 

      o  parallel: specifies that media sent to the group is sent to 
         every primitive which has an input. The group bridges the 
         output from every primitive which has an output into a single 
         common group output; 

      o  serial: specifies that the first primitive listed in the group 
         receives the media sent to the group. Its output is to be 
         connected to the input of the next primitive defined within the

                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
         group and so on until the last primitive within the group which 
         becomes the group output. 

   Groups with these topologies are shown in the two diagrams below. The 
   group on the left has a parallel topology and that on the right has a 
   serial topology.  

           /-> P1 --\ 
          /          \ 
   G(in) +---> P2 ----> G(out)     G(in) --> P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> G(out) 
          \          / 
           \-> P3 --/ 

   More complex media flows may be created by nesting groups of serial 
   and parallel topologies within each other. For example, the diagram 
   below has a group with a serial topology nested within a star 
   topology. 

                  /-----> P1 ------------------------\ 
                 /                                    \ 
         Gs(in) +-> Gp(in) --> P2 --> P3 --> Gp(out) -+> Gs(out) 

   This combination could be used to create record operation where DTMF 
   was to be clamped from the recording itself, but a DTMF key press is 
   still used to stop the recording. In this case, P1 would be a DTMF 
   recognizer, P2 would be a clamp primitive, and P3 a recorder as shown 
   by the following example. This example omits child elements and 
   attributes not concerned with the core concept. The following section 
   discusses sending events and the details of each of the primitives is 
   defined in section 4. 

   <group topology="parallel"> 
      <dtmf/> 
      <group topology="serial"> 
         <clamp/> 
         <record/> 
      </group> 
   </group> 

   A single schema, "fullduplex" is defined for a two dimensional group. 
   A full-duplex two dimensional group is has exactly two immediate 
   children. Those children may be primitives or other one dimensional 
   groups. A "fullduplex" group must only be used as the top most group 
   and must not be nested. Each primitive (P1) and group (G2) becomes 
   half of the full-duplex group as shown in the diagram below. 

                  G-A(in1) +-> G2 --> G-B(out1) 
     
                 G-A(out2) <-- P1 <-+ G-B(in2)

                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
   Full duplex groups are symmetrical when both halves are the same. 
   They are asymmetrical when they differ. Asymmetric groups need to 
   have a name associated with each side. The left side is defined as 
   the input of the first child of the full-duplex group combined with 
   the output of the second child. The right side is reverse. These 
   sides were labeled A and B respectively in the preceding diagram.  

   An example of a full-duplex group is the user operated gain control 
   mentioned at the beginning of this sub-section. The gain should 
   operate on the audio which a user hears, but the gain is controlled 
   by recognizing things such as DTMF or spoken commands in media which 
   the user originates. The following shows the XML tag grouping which 
   would accomplish this and corresponds to the media flow shown in the 
   diagram above. If the user's audio is not required for anything other 
   than control of the gain, then the <relay> is not required and the 
   internal group could be omitted. A complete XML description for this 
   is included in the examples section. 

   <group topology="fullduplex"> 
      <group topology="parallel"> 
         <dtmf/>  
         <relay/> 
      </group> 
      <gain/> 
   </group> 

   It is expected that additional topology schemas together with methods 
   to allow media flow to be explicitly defined will be developed in a 
   future version of this specification. 

   Primitives within a group begin concurrently but may finish 
   asynchronously based upon events which they receive or their task 
   completes. A group terminates when all of the primitives within it 
   have completed. If the group contains a <groupexit> element, then the 
   contents of that element are executed as part of group termination. 

   A group itself may receive a terminate event requesting termination. 
   A terminate event sent to the group causes a terminate event to be 
   sent to each of its currently active primitives. The <groupexit> 
   element is not executed until all primitives have processed their 
   respective terminate events.  

2.3 Events 

   Events provide the mechanism for primitives to interact with each 
   other and for a MOML context to interact with its external 
   environment. The external environment is defined by the way in which 
   a MOML context has been invoked. This will often be through MSML but 
   other languages and protocols such as SIP may also be used.  
 
 
Melanchuk               Expires - February 2005               [Page 9] 
                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
   Every primitive and group conceptually implements their own event 
   queue. Events sent to them get placed into their associated queue. 
   Events are removed from their queues and processed in order. 
   Primitives within a group conceptually have their own thread of 
   execution. Due to the asynchronous nature of servicing events from 
   multiple queues, it cannot be assumed that several events sent in 
   sequence to different queues, will be processed in the order in which 
   they were sent. For example, if recognition of something led to 
   sending events to both a <play> and a <record> in that order, it is 
   possible that the <record> may process its event before the <play> 

   Primitives each define the set of events which they support and the 
   behavior associated with their handling of each event. This allow 
   many types of behaviors to be defined. For example, VCR type controls 
   can be constructed by defining primitives which support events 
   corresponding to each control. Media recognition/detection can be 
   used to cause those events to be generated.  

   Alternatively, events can be originated elsewhere, such as from an 
   application server, and simply received by the primitive implementing 
   the control. Examples of the use of events include adjusting volume 
   (gain) and pause and resume of both announcement playout and record 
   creation. 

   Primitives act on events based upon the longest match of an event 
   name. Event names are a period '.' delimited sequence of tokens. The 
   first token, or the root of the name, can be considered an event 
   class. Matching allows a standard meaning to be defined and then 
   extended based upon what triggers an event's generation. For example, 
   a record primitive has different behavior depending upon whether it 
   completed because a user stopped speaking or because it was 
   cancelled. The recording is retained in the first case but not the 
   second. 

   Longest match allows new recognizers to be created and used without 
   changing how existing primitives are defined. For example, a face 
   recognition capability could be created which generates a 
   terminate.frowning event when a user looks puzzled. Although no 
   primitive directly defines this event, it will still effect a generic 
   terminate action. Primitives which require specialized behavior based 
   upon frowning may be extended to support this. As well, the event can 
   still be exported from the MOML context without requiring that 
   primitives receiving the event understand facial expressions. 

3. Usage with SIP 

   MOML may be used directly with SIP for IVR or fax dialog 
   interactions. It can be initially invoked as part of the "Prompt and 
   Collect" service described in "Basic Network Media Services with SIP" 
 
 
Melanchuk               Expires - February 2005              [Page 10] 
                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
   [9]. That defines service indicators for a small number of well 
   defined services using the user part of the SIP Request-URI (R-URI).  

   The prompt and collect service uses "dialog" as the service 
   indicator. URI parameters further refine the specific IVR request. 
   This document defines an additional parameter "moml-param" for the 
   dialog service indicator as follows: 

   dialog-parameters = ";" ( dialog-param [ vxml-parameters ] ) 
                           | moml-param  
   dialog-param      = "voicexml=" dialog-url 
   moml-param        = "moml=" moml-url 

   There are no additional URI parameters when MOML is used as the 
   dialog language.  

   MOML defines discrete IVR dialog commands. These commands may be 
   included directly in the body of the INVITE to the "dialog" service 
   indicator by using the "cid" [12] URL scheme. This scheme identifies 
   a message body part which in this case would contain the MOML 
   command. Note that a multipart message body, containing a single 
   part, is required even if the INVITE does not contain an SDP offer. 
   Subsequent MOML requests are sent in the body of SIP INFO messages as 
   are all messages from a media server.  

   An example of SIP URI as described above is: 

      sip:dialog@mediaserver.example.net;\ 
          moml=cid:14864099865376@appserver.example.net 

   The body part that contained the MOML referenced by the URL would 
   have a Content-Id header of: 

      Content-Id: <14864099865376@appserver.example.net> 

   The results of executing an <exit> or <disconnect>, or of executing a 
   <send> which has a "target" attribute value equal to "source", are 
   notified in SIP INFO messages using the <event> element. No messages 
   are sent if execution completes normally without executing one of 
   these elements. 

   If there is an error during validation or execution, then a media 
   server must notify the error as described above and must include the 
   namelist items "moml.error.status" and "moml.error.description". The 
   values for these items are defined in section 12. 

   A restricted subset of MOML can also be used with the "Announcement" 
   service defined in [9]. This service uses "ann" as the service 
   indicator and defines parameters that describe an announcement. The 
 
 
Melanchuk               Expires - February 2005              [Page 11] 
                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
   "play=" parameter identifies the URL of a prompt or a provisioned 
   announcement sequence. The value of the "play=" parameter can refer 
   to a MOML body part using a "cid" URL as described above. That body 
   part must only contain the <play> primitive.  

   Using MOML enhances the announcement service by allowing the client 
   to specify a sequence of audio segments rather than requiring each 
   sequence to be provisioned. Moreover, MOML defines a standard set of 
   variables in contrast to [9] which defines a parameterization 
   mechanism but does not formally specify any semantics. 

   If a media server does not understand the "cid" scheme or does not 
   understand MOML, it must respond with the SIP response code "488 -  
   not acceptable here". If the MOML body contains elements other than 
   the <play> primitive, or there are errors during validation, a media 
   server must respond with a SIP response code "400 - bad request". 
   Finally, if there is a discrepancy between parameters specified in 
   the Request-URI and corresponding attributes defined in the MOML 
   body, the Request-URI parameters must be silently ignored.  

   Using MOML does not change the operation of the announcement service 
   from that defined in [9]. When the announcement completes, a media 
   server issues a SIP BYE request. The INFO method is not used with the 
   announcement service.  

4. Structure and Modularity  

   MOML is designed to be a modular language. Defining the language in 
   terms of modules allows different vendors and communities to choose a 
   specific language subset, or define different language extensions, 
   for achieving a wide range of applications across a diverse set of 
   platforms. Modularity combined with namespaces allow independent 
   development of new extensions. 

   MOML is structured as a set of modules. Only a single module is 
   required. That simple core module, moml-core-module, defines a MOML 
   request to a media server. It consists of the ôprimitiveö 
   abstraction, an abstract element for control flow, the sequential 
   execution model, and the <send> element. That is, the core module 
   allows for the execution of a sequence of one or more media 
   processing primitives with the ability to notify events to the 
   invocation environment.  

   Primitives are divided into four modules. The first, moml-basic-
   primitives, defines the basic <play>, <record>, <dtmf>, and <vad> 
   elements. Another module, moml-transform-primitives, defines the 
   simple half duplex filters. More advanced primitives are defined in 
   the speech and fax modules. The speech module depends on the play 
   module as it extends the capability of <play> by adding synthesized 
 
 
Melanchuk               Expires - February 2005              [Page 12] 
                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
   speech. Finally, the group execution model, which is currently the 
   only element which changes the flow of control is defined in a 
   separate module. All of these module are optional although at least 
   one primitive module is required to have a functional implementation. 

   The formal process for defining extensions to MOML is to define a new 
   module. The new module must provide a text description of what 
   extensions are included and how they work. It must also define an XML 
   schema file (if applicable) that defines the new module (which may be 
   through extension or restriction of an existing module). Dependencies 
   upon other modules must be stated. For example a module that extends 
   or restricts has a dependency on the original. Finally, the new 
   module must be assigned a unique name and version. 

   The types of things which can be defined in new modules are: 

      o  new primitives 

      o  extensions to existing primitives (events, shadow variables, 
         attributes, content) 

      o  new recognition grammars for existing primitives 

      o  new markup languages for speech generation 

      o  languages for specifying a topology schema 

      o  new pre-defined topology schemas 

      o  new variables / segment types (sets & languages) 

      o  new control flow elements 

   Modules are assembled together to form a specific MOML profile that 
   is shared between different implementations. The base MOML profile 
   which is defined in this documents consists of the moml-core, group, 
   and basic and transform primitives modules. Speech and facsimile are 
   examples of optional modules which extend the base language.  

   Modules which define primitives must define the following for each 
   primitive within the module: 

      o  the function which the primitive performs 

      o  the attributes which may be used to tailor its behavior 

      o  the events which it is capable of understanding 


 
 
Melanchuk               Expires - February 2005              [Page 13] 
                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
      o  the shadow variables which provide access to information 
         determined as a result of the primitive's operation. 

   The mechanism used to insure that a media server and its client share 
   a compatible set of modules is not defined. Currently it is expected 
   that provisioning will be used, possibly coupled with a future 
   auditing capability. Additionally, when used in SIP networks, modules 
   could be defined using feature tags and the procedures defined for 
   Indicating User Agent Capabilities in SIP [2] used to allow a media 
   server to describe its capabilities to other user agents and its 
   domain registrar. 

5. <moml> 

   The root element for MOML. The contents of this element describe 
   either a complete execution context for a media resource object or 
   the event to be notified to a MOML client. 

      Attributes: 

         version: "1.0" Mandatory. 

         id: an identifier unique to this object. Events returned from 
         MOML (the "target" attribute of a <send> is equal to "source") 
         will be correlated with this identifier. Mandatory. 

      Events: 

         terminate: terminates the MOML context. A terminate event gets 
         sent to the currently executing <group> or primitive. 

6. MOML Core Module 

   The core module defines the structural framework and abstractions for 
   MOML (via its schema). It also defines the basic elements which are 
   not part of the core primitive or control abstractions. These 
   elements are defined below. 

6.1 Elements Received by a Media Server 

6.1.1 <send> 

   Sends an event and optional namelist to the recipient identified by 
   the target attribute. Event names are defined by the recipient. In 
   the case where the recipient is a MOML group or primitive, the events 
   are defined within this document. Other recipients may use names that 
   are suitable for their environment. 


 
 
Melanchuk               Expires - February 2005              [Page 14] 
                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
   The "target" attribute specifies the recipient of the event. 
   Recipients may be other MOML primitives or groups executing within 
   the object, the object itself, or the environment which invoked MOML. 
   Any target which is unknown within the object is assumed to be 
   destined to the external environment. By convention, the string 
   "source" is used to address that environment but any target name 
   distinct from the MOML namespace may be used.  

      Attributes: 

         event: the name of an event.  

         target: the recipient of the event. The recipient may be a MOML 
         primitive, the currently executing group, or the MOML 
         environment. A primitive is specified by a primitive type, 
         optionally appended by a period '.' followed by the identifier 
         of a primitive. Identifiers are only needed when more than one 
         primitive of the same type exists in the object. The executing 
         group is specified using the token "group". The environment is 
         specified using the token "source", optionally appended by a 
         period '.' followed by any environment specific target. 

         namelist: a list of zero or more shadow variables which are 
         included with the event. 

6.1.2 <exit> 

   Exit causes execution of the MOML object to terminate.  

      Attributes: 

         namelist: a list of one or more shadow variables which may 
         optionally be sent to the context which invoked the MOML 
         object. 

6.1.3 <disconnect> 

   Disconnect is similar to <exit> but has the additional semantics of 
   indicating to the context which invoked the MOML object, that it 
   should disconnect from a media server, the media stream associated 
   with the object. The method of disconnection depends upon how the 
   media stream was initially established. If SIP was used, a 
   <disconnect> would cause a media server to issue a BYE request. The 
   request would be sent for the SIP dialog associated with media 
   session on which the MOML object was operating. 

      Attributes:

         namelist: a list of one or more shadow variables which may 
         optionally be sent to the context which invoked the MOML 
         object. 

6.2 Elements Sent by a Media Server 

6.2.1 <event> 

   The <event> element is used to describe an event and its associated 
   namelist when MOML is used as a standalone dialog language such as  
   with SIP. Events are generated and formatted when a <send>, <exit>, 
   or <disconnect> is executed. 

      attributes:  

         name: the type of event. If the event is generated because of 
         the execution of a <send>, the value must be the value of the 
         "event" attribute from the <send> element. If the event is 
         generated because of the execution of an <exit>, the value must 
         be "moml.exit". If the event is generated because of the 
         execution of a <disconnect>, the value must be 
         "moml.disconnect". If the even is generated because of an 
         error, the value must be "moml.error". Mandatory. 

         id: the identifier of the MOML object generating the event. 
         Mandatory. 

   <event> has two children, <name> and <value>, which contain the name 
   and value respectively of each namelist item associated with the 
   event. 

7. Group Module 

   The group module defines a single control flow construct that 
   specifies concurrent execution. Future modules may define additional 
   flow control constructs. 

7.1 <group> 

   The <group> element allows the contained primitives to be executed 
   concurrently. 

      Attributes: 

         topology: specifies a schema which defines the flow of media 
         within the group. Three schemas are initially defined. 
         "fullduplex" is specified for use with two dimensional groups. 
         "parallel" and "serial" are for use with one dimensional

         groups. The definition of these topologies is defined in 
         section 2. Mandatory. 

         id: identifies name of the group. Mandatory when groups are 
         nested. 

      Events: 

         terminate: causes a terminate event to be sent to each element 
         contained within the group. 

7.2 <groupexit> 

   The <groupexit> element allows events to be sent when group 
   processing completes. Group processing completes when all contained 
   primitives terminate. 

      Attributes: 

         none 

      Events: 

         none 

8. Basic Primitives Module 

   Subsections of a primitive define child elements of that primitive 
   and are not themselves considered primitives. They do not receive 
   events or populate shadow variables. 

8.1 <play> 

   Play is used to generate an audio stream. It plays in sequence the 
   media created by the child media elements <audio>, <tts>, and <var>. 
   When the play stops, either because the terminate event is received 
   or all media generation has completed, the <playexit> element, if 
   present, is executed. At least one media generation element must be 
   present. 

   Play supports two states; generate and suspend. Media generation 
   occurs in the generate state and is suspended in the suspend state. 
   Once in the suspend state, media generation continues upon receiving 
   the generate event. The default initial state is generate. 

   Audio may be generated in different languages by specifying the 
   xml:lang attribute for <play> and/or the child elements of <play>. 
   The language is inherited by the child elements but each child can 
   specify its own language. Except for physical audio clips, it is an

   error if a language is specified but the media server can not render 
   the audio in the requested language.  

      Attributes: 

         id: an optional identifier which may be referenced elsewhere 
         for sending events to the play primitive. 

         interval: specifies the delay between stopping one iteration 
         and beginning another. The attribute has no effect if 
         iterations is not also specified. Default is no interval. 

         iterate: specifies the number of times the media specified by 
         the child media elements should be played. Defaults to once 
         '1'. 

         initial: defines the initial state for the play element. 
         Default is "generate".  

         maxtime: defines the maximum allowed time for the <play> to 
         complete. 

         offset: defines an offset, measured in units of time, where the 
         <play> is to begin media generation. Offset is only valid when 
         all child media elements are <audio>. 

         skip: an amount, expressed in time, which will be used to skip 
         through the media when "forward" and "backward" events are 
         received. Default is 3s (three seconds).  

         xml:lang: specifies the language to use for content which can 
         be rendered in different languages.  

      Events: 

         pause: causes the play to enter the suspend state.  

         resume: causes play to enter the generate state. 

         forward: skips forward through the media. Only has effect when 
         all child media elements are <audio>. 

         backward: skips backward through the media. Only has effect 
         when all child media elements are <audio>. 

         restart: skips to the beginning of the media. Only has effect 
         when all child media elements are <audio>. 

         toggle-state: causes the suspend / generate state to toggle.

         terminate: terminates the play and assigns values to the shadow 
         variables. 

      Shadow Variables: 

         play.amt: identifies the length of time for which media was 
         generated before the play was stopped. This does not include 
         time which may have elapsed while the play was in the suspend 
         state. 

         play.end: contains the event which caused the play to stop. 
         When the play stops because all media generation has completed, 
         end is assigned the value "play.complete". 

8.1.1 Child Elements 

8.1.1.1 <audio> 

   Identifies pre-recorded audio to play. Local URI references may 
   resolve to a single physical audio clip, a logical clip, or a 
   provisioned sequence of clips (physical or logical). A logical clip 
   is one which can be rendered differently based on the language 
   attribute. Logical clips are provisioned for each of the languages 
   that a media server supports. Remote URI references are resolved 
   according to the capabilities of the remote server. 

      Attributes: 

         uri: Identifies the location of the audio to be played. The 
         file and http schemes are supported.  

         iterate: specifies the number of times the audio is to be 
         played. Defaults to once '1'. 

         xml:lang: specifies the language to use when the URI identifies 
         a logical clip, either directly, or as part of a sequence.  

8.1.1.2 <var> 

   Specifies the generation of audio from a variable using prerecorded 
   audio segments. A variable represents a semantic concept (such as 
   date or number) and dynamically produces the appropriate speech. 

   Prerecorded audio allows an application vendor or service provider to 
   choose the exact voice for their audio and therefore completely 
   control the "sound and feel" of the service provided to end users. It 
   provides very high audio quality and allows the variables to blend 
   seamlessly into the surrounding audio segments.

                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
   Text to speech (TTS) using SSML may also be used to render variables, 
   but may not provide as good quality, or allow as complete control of 
   the "sound and feel" or user experience. TTS is normally used for 
   reading text such as emails and for very large vocabularies such as 
   stock names. TTS results in a very clear difference between the 
   variables and the surrounding audio segments. 

      Attributes: 

         type: specifies the type of variable. Mandatory. Variable type 
         must be one of "date", "digits", "duration", "month", "money", 
         "number", "silence", "time", or "weekday". 

         subtype: specifies an optional clarification of type. Specific 
         values depend upon the type. 

         value: text which should be rendered appropriate to the type 
         and subtype attributes. 

         xml:lang: specifies the language to use when rendering the 
         variable.  

8.1.1.3 <playexit> 

   The <playexit> element is invoked when generation of all content of 
   the <play> has come to completion. The contents of this element may 
   be used to send events. 

      Attributes: 

         none 

8.2 <dtmfgen> 

   DTMF generator originates one or more DTMF digits in sequence. 

      Attributes: 

         id: an optional identifier which may be referenced elsewhere 
         for sending events to the dtmfgen primitive. 

         digits: A string of characters from the alphabet "0-9a-d#*" 
         which correspond to a sequence of DTMF tones. Mandatory. 

         level: used to define the power level for which the tones will 
         be generated. Expressed in dBm0 in a range of 0 to -96 dBm0. 
         Larger negative values express lower power levels. Note that 
         values lower than -55 dBm0 will be rejected by most receivers 
         (TR-TSY-000181, ITU-T Q.24A). Default is -6 dBm0.

         dur: the duration in milliseconds for which each tone should be 
         generated. Implementations may round the value if they only 
         support discrete durations. Default 100 ms. 

         interval: the duration in milliseconds of a silence interval 
         following each generated tone. Implementations may round the 
         value if they only support discrete durations. Default 100 ms. 

      Events: 

         terminate: terminates DTMF generation and assigns values to the 
         shadow variables. 

      Shadow Variables: 

         dtmfgen.end: contains the event which caused DTMF generation to 
         stop. 

8.2.1 Child Elements 

8.2.1.1 <dtmfgenexit> 

   The <dtmfgenexit> element is invoked when the DTMF generation 
   operation completes or is terminated as a result of receiving the 
   terminate event. The <dtmfgenexit> element may be used to send events 
   when the recording has completed. 

      Attributes:

8.3 <record> 

   Record creates a recording. Similar to play, <record> supports two 
   states; create and suspend. Received media becomes part of the 
   recording when <record> is in the create state and is discarded when 
   it is in the suspend state. 

   Recording terminates when a terminate event is received or when a 
   nospeech event is received and no audio has yet been recorded. 
   <record> differentiates different types of terminate events. 

      Attributes: 

         id: an optional identifier which may be referenced elsewhere 
         for sending events to the record primitive. 

         append: a boolean which defines whether the recording is 
         allowed to be appended to an existing file if dest already

         exists. Default is "false". The attribute is ignored if the 
         scheme is http. 

         dest: the destination for the recording. Recording may be 
         either local or external based upon the attribute value. 
         Currently the file and http schemes are supported.  

         format: defines the encoding and file type of the recording. 

         initial: defines the initial state for the record element. 
         Default is "create". 

         maxtime: defines the maximum length of the recording in units 
         of time.  

      Events: 

         pause: causes the record to enter the suspend state. Received 
         media is discarded. 

         resume: causes record to resume if it was suspended. It has no 
         effect otherwise. 

         toggle-state: causes the suspend / create state to toggle. 

         terminate: terminates the recording and assigns values to the 
         shadow variables.  

         terminate.cancelled: terminates the recording and assigns 
         values to the shadow variables. If the dest attribute used the 
         file  scheme, the local recording is deleted. Applications are  
         responsible for removing external files created using the http 
         scheme.  

         terminate.finalsilence: terminates the recording and assigns 
         values to the shadow variables. If the dest attribute used the 
         file scheme, the final silence is removed from the recording.  

         nospeech: terminates the recording and assigns values to the 
         shadow variables if it is received and no recording has yet 
         been created. The "nospeech" event is ignored if audio has 
         already been recorded. 

      Shadow Variables: 

         record.len: the actual length of the recording measured in 
         units of time. This does not include time which may have 
         elapsed while the record was in the suspend state.

         record.end: contains the event which caused the record to 
         terminate. When the record terminates because maxtime is 
         exceeded, end is assigned the value "record.timeexceeded". 

8.3.1 Child Elements 

8.3.1.1 <recordexit> 

   The <recordexit> element is invoked when the record operation 
   completes or when the recording is terminated as a result of 
   receiving the terminate event. The <recordexit> element may be used 
   to send events when the recording has completed. 

      Attributes: 

         none 

8.4 <dtmf> 

   DTMF input fulfils several roles within MOML. It is used to trigger 
   events which will affect the media processing operation of other 
   primitives. It is also used to collect DTMF digits from a media 
   stream which are to be reported back to the user of MOML. Often DTMF 
   detection is used for both purposes. Barge is the most common 
   example, where a prompt is stopped based upon DTMF input but more 
   digits may remain to be collected.  

   DTMF detection supports multiple simultaneous recognition patterns. 
   Different patterns can be used to trigger sending different events in 
   order to implement DTMF controls. Alternatively one pattern may be 
   used to represent a collection and another pattern, a substring of 
   the first, used as a barge indication.  

   Note that all patterns share the same digit collection buffer, inter-
   digit timing, a single <nomatch> element, and a single <noinput> 
   element. As such, multiple patterns may not be suitable to support 
   simultaneous collections for different purposes. When this is 
   required, separate <dtmf> elements should be used instead. 

   <dtmf> terminates if any of the <pattern>, <noinput>, or <nomatch> 
   elements are matched the maximum number of times that they are 
   allowed. The number of times they may match may be specified as an 
   attribute of <dtmf> or of the individual child elements.  

      Attributes: 

         cleardb: a boolean indication of whether the buffer for digit 
         collection should be cleared of any collected digits when the 
         element is instantiated. If set to false, any digits currently

         in the buffer are immediately compared against the pattern 
         elements.  

         fdt: defines the first-digit timer value. The first-digit timer 
         is started when DTMF detection is initially invoked. If no DTMF 
         digits are detected during this initial interval, the <noinput> 
         element is invoked. 

         idt: defines the inter-digit timer to be used when digits are 
         being collected. When specified, the timers is started when the 
         first digit is detected and restarted on each subsequent digit. 
         Timer expiration is applied to all patterns. After that, if any 
         patterns remain active and a nomatch element is specified, the 
         nomatch is executed and DTMF input terminates. The idt 
         attribute should only be used when digit collection is being 
         performed. No default. 

         starttimer: boolean value which defines whether the first digit 
         timer (fdt) is started initially. When set to false, the 
         starttimer event must be received for it to start. Default 
         false. 

         iterate: specifies the number of times the <pattern>, 
         <noinput>, and <nomatch> elements may be executed unless those 
         elements specify differently. The value "forever" may be used 
         to indicate that these may be executed any number of times. 
         Default is once '1'. 

      Events: 

         starttimer: starts the first digit timer (fdt) if it has not 
         already been started. Has no effect otherwise. 

         terminate: terminates the DTMF input and assigns values to the 
         shadow variables. 

      Shadow Variables: 

         dtmf.digits: the string of DTMF digits which have been received 
         (the contents of the digit buffer). 

         dtmf.len: the number of digits in the digit buffer. 

         dtmf.last: the last digit in the digit buffer. 

         dtmf.end: contains the event which caused the <dtmf> to 
         terminate or is assigned one of "dtmf.match", "dtmf.noinput", 
         or "dtmf.nomatch" depending upon which of the corresponding 
         elements reached its maximum.

8.4.1 Child Elements 

8.4.1.1 <pattern> 

   The pattern element describes one or more DTMF digits that are to be 
   recognized. When the pattern is matched, the child elements are 
   executed. 

      Attributes: 

         digits: The digit pattern which should be matched.  

         format: an enumerated value which defines the format used to 
         express the digit pattern. The format may be "mgcp" or "megaco" 
         for patterns expressed as digit map from those specifications, 
         or as one of the simple built-in formats defined within this 
         specification. Currently, a single built-in format 
         "moml+digits" is defined which allows a match based on either 
         one or more specific digits, or based upon a specific length 
         specification with an optional return key. "moml+digits" is the 
         default. 

         iterate: specifies the number of times the <pattern> may be 
         matched. The value "forever" may be used to indicate that 
         <pattern> may be matched any number of times. This value 
         overrides any specified in <dtmf>. Default is once '1'. 

8.4.1.2 <detect> 

   The contents of the <detect> element are executed whenever any DTMF 
   is first detected. It may be matched at most once. 

      Attributes: 

         none 

8.4.1.3 <noinput> 

   The <noinput> element is used when DTMF is being collected. Children 
   of the <noinput> element are executed when DTMF has not been detected 
   and the first digit timeout occurs.  

      Attributes: 

         iterate: specifies the number of times the <noinput> may be 
         triggered. The value "forever" may be used to indicate that 
         <noinput> may be triggered any number of times. This value 
         overrides any specified in <dtmf>. Default is once '1'.

8.4.1.4 <nomatch> 

   The <nomatch> element is used when DTMF is being collected. Children 
   of the <nomatch> element are executed when it is determined that none 
   of the individual patterns can be matched.  

      Attributes: 

         iterate: specifies the number of times the <nomatch> may be 
         triggered. The value "forever" may be used to indicate that 
         <nomatch> may be triggered any number of times. This value 
         overrides any specified in <dtmf>. Default is once '1'. 

8.4.1.5 <dtmfexit> 

   The <dtmfexit> element is invoked when the dtmf input completes 
   because one of <pattern>, <noinput>, or <nomatch> occurred its 
   maximum number of times.  

      Attributes: 

         none 

9. Transform Primitives Module 

   The transform primitives module gathers together the simple 
   primitives which work as filters on half duplex media streams. 

9.1 <vad> 

   (This is not a transform primitive but not sure where it should go.)

   Voice activity detection (VAD) is used to detect voice and silence 
   when speech recognition is not required. Similar to both speech and 
   DTMF, a VAD has different media conditions which it can match. Those 
   conditions can be qualified by a minimum length of time which is 
   required for them to be considered recognized.  

      Attributes: 

         starttimer: boolean value which defines whether the timer is 
         started to allow recognition of the initial condition (voice, 
         silence). When set to false, the starttimer event must be 
         received in order for the initial condition to be recognized. 
         The timer does not affect recognition of the transition 
         conditions. Default false. 

      Events:

                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
         starttimer: starts the timer to allow recognition of the 
         initial condition if it has not already been started. Has no 
         effect otherwise. 

         terminate: terminates voice activity detection. 

      Shadow Variables: 

         none 

9.1.1 Child Elements 

9.1.1.1 <voice>, <silence>, <tvoice>, <tsilence> 

   Each child element corresponds to a condition which a VAD can detect. 
   The first two detect when voice or silence has been initially present 
   for a minimum length of time since the VAD was started. The second 
   two require that a transition to the voice or silence condition first 
   occur.  

      Attributes: 

         len: the length of time the condition must persist in order to 
         be recognized. In the case of <tvoice> and <tsilence>, the 
         length of time applies only to the final recognized condition. 

         sen: the maximum length of time the condition not being 
         detected may occur without causing the detector to begin 
         measuring that condition. 

9.2 <gain> 

   Gain is used to adjust of the gain of a media stream by a specific 
   amount.  

      attributes:  

         incr: an increment, expressed in dB, which will be used to 
         adjust the gain when "louder" and "softer" events are received. 
         Default is 3 dB. 

         amt: a specific gain to apply specified in dB. 

      events: 

         mute: self explanatory. 

         unmute: self explanatory.

         reset: sets the gain to zero dB.  

         louder: makes the audio on a stream louder. 

         softer: makes the audio on a stream quieter. 

         amt: sets the gain to the specified value between -96 dB and 9 
         dB. 

9.3 <agc> 

   Automatic gain control is used to have a media server automatically 
   adjust the gain of a media stream.  

      attributes:  

         tgtlvl: the desired target level for AGC specified in dBm0. 

         maxgain: the maximum gain that AGC will apply specified in dB. 

      events: 

         mute: self explanatory. 

         unmute: self explanatory. 

9.4 <gate> 

   A simple filter which will pass or halt media, regardless of the 
   format of the media stream, based on the events it receives. <gate> 
   shares the same mute and unmute events for compatibility with the 
   gain primitives <gain> and <agc>. 

      attributes:  

         initial: the values "pass" and "halt" define whether media is 
         initially allowed to pass. Default is to pass. 

      events: 

         mute: halts media flow through the primitive. 

         unmute: allows media to pass through the primitive. 

9.5 <clamp> 

   This element is used to filter DTMF tones from a media stream. Media 
   other than DTMF tones is passed unchanged.

   output.  

      attributes:  

         none. 

      events: 

         none. 

10. Speech Module 

   The speech module defines a standalone primitive for automatic speech 
   recognition <speech> and extends the <play> primitive defined in the 
   basic primitives module to include speech synthesis. As such, this 
   module depends on the basic primitives module. 

10.1 <speech> 

   Activates grammars or user input rules associated with speech 
   recognition. If multiple grammars are specified, all are activated. 
   All active grammars share the same timers, recognition attributes, 
   and <noinput> and <nomatch> elements. Each grammar may have its own 
   <match> element.  

   <speech> terminates if any of the <grammar>, <noinput>, or <nomatch> 
   elements are matched the maximum number of times that they are 
   allowed. The number of times they may match may be specified as an 
   attribute of <speech> or of the individual child elements.  

      Attributes: 

         noint: specifies a time period during which speech input must 
         be started, otherwise the associated <noinput> element is 
         invoked.

         norect: specifies a maximum time period during in which speech 
         must begin to be matched, otherwise the associated <nomatch> 
         element is invoked. 

         spcmplt: specifies the length of silence necessary after speech 
         before a result will be finalized in the case where there is a 
         complete match of an active grammar. Following the silence, the 
         appropriate <match> element will be triggered if the result is 
         above the confidence level. Otherwise a <nomatch> element will 
         be triggered. 

         spincmplt: specifies the length of silence necessary after 
         speech before a result will be finalized in the case where 
         there is a incomplete match of all active grammars. Following 
         the silence, the <nomatch> element will be triggered. 

         confidence: the minimum confidence level which the recognizer 
         must have to consider a recognition result as matching a 
         grammar. Expressed as an integer between 1-100. 

         sens: specifies the sensitivity of the recognizer to determine 
         whether speech is present. Lower sensitivity may be required 
         for the recognizer to work well in the presence of high 
         background noise or line echo. 

         starttimer: boolean value which defines whether the no input 
         (noint) and no recognition (norect) are started initially. When 
         set to false, the starttimer event must be received in order to 
         start them. Default false. 

         iterate: specifies the number of times the <grammar>, 
         <noinput>, and <nomatch> elements may be executed unless those 
         elements specify differently. The value "forever" may be used 
         to indicate that these may be executed any number of times. 
         Default is once '1'. 

      Events: 

         sens: sets the sensitivity of the recognizer as described 
         above. 

         starttimer: starts the no input (noint) and no recognition 
         (norect) timers if they have not already been started. Has no 
         effect otherwise. 

         terminate: terminates the speech input and assigns values to 
         the shadow variables.

         speech.end: contains the event which caused the <speech> to 
         terminate or is assigned one of "speech.match", 
         "speech.noinput", or "speech.nomatch" depending upon which of 
         the corresponding elements reached its maximum. 

         speech.results: contains the results of a matched grammar. The 
         results are formatted using the Natural Language Semantics 
         Markup Language (NLSML) [6]. When this variable is referenced 
         to return results, the results are returned as a separate MIME 
         entity. 

10.1.1 Child Elements 

10.1.1.1 <grammar> 

   Specifies and activates a speech grammar based on Speech Recognition 
   Grammar Specification (SRGS) [5] XML notation. Grammars may be

   Children of the <noinput> element are executed when speech has not 
   been detected and the no input timeout (noint) occurs.  

      Attributes: 

         iterate: specifies the number of times the <noinput> may be 
         triggered. The value "forever" may be used to indicate that 
         <noinput> may be triggered any number of times. This value 
         overrides any specified in <speech>. Default is once '1'.

   XML perspective, <tts> is a member of a media substitution group. See 
   the schema at the end of this document for details. 

10.2.1 Child Elements 

10.2.1.1 <tts> 

   Contents of the <tts> element are rendered using Text To Speech 
   services and must be compliant to the SSML specification. Element 
   content may be plain text, contain the SSML <speak> element, or the 
   uri attribute should identify the location of text to be rendered.

11. Fax Module 

   The fax module defines primitives which allow a media server to 
   provide facsimile services. 

11.1 <faxdetect> 

   Fax tone detection is used to detect the presence of the T.30 CNG 
   tone in a media stream. Child elements of <faxtone> are executed when 
   the CNG tone is detected. 

      Attributes: 

         none 

11.2 <faxsend> 

   The <faxsend> primitive provides the functionality of a calling fax 
   terminal. This typically means sending a set of pages. However, it 
   can also mean requesting the called terminal to send pages instead 
   of, or in addition to, sending pages. The fax images to send are 
   defined by the <sendobj> elements, described below.  

   Requesting the called terminal to send pages happens when the 
   <rxpoll> element is included as part of <faxsend>. This element may 
   be included in addition to, or instead of, the <sendobj> element. One 
   <sendobj> (at a minimum) or <rxpoll> element must be present. When 
   both are present, a media server will first send pages and will then 
   poll the other terminal, requesting pages. 

   Because fax is a distinct media type, the <faxsend> primitive is not 
   expected to interact with other primitives. Rather, it will interact 
   using fax protocols with a remote fax terminal (or gateway) and will 
   send requested status events to its invoking environment. During fax 
   operation, shadow variables are used to record the progress and 
   parameters of the varying stages of fax operation.  

   Status events are requested by including one or more status request 
   elements. These elements correspond to different stages or events in 
   fax operation and cause pre-defined events to be sent to the invoking 
   environment when they occur. Since the only recipient of these events 
   is expected to be a fax application server, requests are simplified 
   by associating a pre-defined namelist of shadow variables with each 
   event. This decision may be revisited to allowed tailored namelists 
   based on further implementation experience. Status requests apply 
   both to sending and polling operation.

         "fax.uri.access.error", and "fax.invalid.startpage". 

11.2.1 Child Elements 

11.2.1.1 <sendobj> 

   <sendobj> is used to define a fax transmission. There may be multiple 
   instances of the element which will be transmitted in order.  

      Attributes: 

         objuri: a URI that points to the fax image that will be 
         transmitted. Mandatory. 

         startpage: the first page of a multi-page objuri to send. 

         pagecount: page count. 

11.2.1.2 <hdrfooter> 

   <hdrfooter> describes the header/footer that a media server will put 
   on pages. The header or footer may be defined as the content of the 
   <format> child element. The <format> element is only allowed if the 
   type attribute has a value of "header" or "footer".  

      Attributes: 

         type: specifies whether a header or a footer should be put on 
         pages and identifies the source of the header or footer. The 
         following enumerated values may be used: 

            "header" indicates that the media server should put a header 
                     on pages using the contents of the <format> 
                     element.  

            "nohdr"  indicates that there should be no header or footer.

         style: defines the style of insertion onto a fax page that a 
         media server should use for the header or footer. Valid styles 
         are "append", "overlay", or "replace". 

   <format> is a child of the <hdrfooter> element that defines the style 
   format to be used for the header or footer. It uses a "C" language 
   style format statement (as shown below) to define the contents and 
   layout of the header or footer.

11.2.1.3 <rxpoll> 

   <rxpoll> provides the information necessary for a receive polling 
   operation to occur. The object(s) to be received are defined by one 
   or more <rcvobj> elements. The <rcvobj> is defined further under the 
   child elements of <faxrcv>. The <rxpoll> element may also include a 
   description of the header/footer that a media server should put on 
   received pages. The <hdrfooter> element and it's usage is described 
   above. 

      Attributes: 

         rmtid: specifies the identifier of the remote fax terminal that 
         to be associated with a polling operation. A media server must 
         not execute a polling operation unless the value of rmtid 
         matches that of the connected remote machine.

11.3 <faxrcv> 

   The <faxrcv> primitive provides the functionality of a called fax 
   terminal. Typically this type of operation is to receive pages. 
   However, it can include sending pages instead of, or in addition to, 
   receiving them. The fax objects to receive are defined by the 
   <rcvobj> elements, described below.  

   A media server will send pages as a polled terminal when the <txpoll> 
   element is included as part of <faxrcv>. This element may be included 
   in addition to, or instead of, the <rcvobj> element. One <rcvobj> or 
   <txpoll> element must be present. When both are present, a media 
   server will first receive pages and will then allow the other 
   terminal to poll the media server, requesting pages. 

   Because fax is a distinct media type, the <faxrcv> primitive is not 
   expected to interact with other primitives. Rather, it will interact 
   using fax protocols with a remote fax terminal and will send 
   requested status events to its invoking environment. During fax 
   operation, shadow variables are used to record the progress and 
   parameters of the varying stages of fax operation.  

   Status events are requested by including one or more status request 
   elements. These elements correspond to different stages or events in 
   fax operation and cause pre-defined events to be sent to the invoking 
   environment when they occur. Since the only recipient of these events 
   is expected to be a fax application server, requests are simplified 
   by associating a pre-defined namelist of shadow variables with each

   event. This decision may be revisited to allowed tailored namelists 
   based on further implementation experience. Status requests apply 
   both to receiving and polling operation. 

      Attributes: 

         lclid: the identifier that a media server uses to identify 
         itself. 

         ecm: specifies whether ECM mode is allowed to be used if 
         supported by the remote terminal. Defaults to "true". 

      Events: 

         terminate: terminates the fax reception operation. 

      Shadow Variables: 

         <faxrcv> supports the same set of shadow variables as <faxsend> 

11.3.1 Child Elements 

   In addition to the elements defined below, <faxrcv> may also have the 
   following child elements which were defined under <faxsend>: 

      o  <hdrfooter> 
      o  <faxstart> 
      o  <faxnegotiate> 
      o  <faxpagedone> 
      o  <faxobjectdone> 
      o  <faxopcomplete> 
      o  <faxpollstarted> 

   Their meaning and usage is the same as previously defined. 

11.3.1.1 <rcvobj> 

   <rcvobj> is used to define fax objects that a media server will 
   receive. There may be multiple instances of the element which will be 
   used in order.  

      Attributes: 

         objuri: a URI that points to the location that a received image 
         is to be stored. Mandatory. 

         maxpages: the maximum number of pages that will be stored in 
         objuri.

11.3.1.2 <txpoll> 

   <txpoll> provides the information for a polling operation to occur as 
   part of a fax receive operation. Multiple object(s) to be send may be 
   supplied by one or more <sendobj> elements. In the event of multiple 
   occurrences, a media server must select the <sendobj> element whose 
   rmtid attribute matches that of the remote terminal. 

   The <sendobj> element was defined previously as a child element of 
   <faxsend>. For <txpoll> is extended with an rmtid attribute that 
   specifies the identifier of the remote fax terminal and is used to 
   select the specific <sendobj> to send. 

   A media server will put a header/footer on transmitted pages based on 
   any <hdrfooter> element included as part of <txpoll>. 

      Attributes: 

         none 

12. Failure Codes 

   Failure codes are used to indicate reasons for failures. The 
   appropriate code and description must be passed to the invoking 
   environment on failure.

13. Examples 

13.1 Announcement 

   The following is a simple announcement scenario. Two recorded audio 
   files are played in sequence followed by generated speech followed by 
   a variable. The results are reported once media generation completes. 

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
   <moml version="1.0" id="12345"> 
      <play> 
         <audio uri="file://clip1.wav"/> 
         <audio uri="http://host1/clip2.wav"/> 
         <tts uri="http://host2/text.ssml"/> 
         <var type="date" subtype="mdy" value="20030601"/> 
      </play> 
      <send target="source" event="done" namelist="play.amt play.end"/> 
   </moml> 

13.2 Voice Mail Retrieval 

   Below is an example which shows a simple voice mail retrieval 
   operation consisting of playing a message and allowing the user to 
   pause and resume play using '5' to toggle the state. The operation 
   would terminate when the play completed or the user entered '#'. 
   During the play, the user can advance forward and backward through 
   the message as well as rewinding to the beginning.

13.3 Play and Record 

   A more complex example is a play and record operation. This sources 
   and sinks media and uses voice activity DTMF detection and 
   recognition to influence behavior. Any DTMF input or voice activity 
   will barge the play and cause the record to begin. However, if the 
   prompt was barged with a DTMF digit of '#', the record terminates 
   without starting. When the play terminates, it send a starttimer 
   event to the VAD to allow it to recognize an initial silence 
   condition. The recording will be terminated (without starting) when 
   the VAD detects an initial 3 seconds of silence. 

   Once resumed (based upon voice detection) the recording may be 
   terminated under several conditions. It will terminate after 5 
   seconds of silence or after 60 seconds elapses. It will also 
   terminate if a '#' key is recognized. Every aspect of this behavior 
   can be modified by changing what is recognized and the events which 
   are sent.

13.6 User Controlled Gain  

   This shows an example of nesting groups to create an arbitrary full 
   duplex media control. DTMF is detected on media flowing in one 
   direction and used to adjust the gain applied to media flowing in the 
   opposite direction. Additionally, the stream which is used to detect 
   DTMF has DTMF removed and its gain automatically adjusted before 
   leaving the group. This widget could be used between a conference 
   participant and a conference mixer.

14. Change Summary 

   The following are the primary changes between this version of the 
   draft and the -01 version: 

      o  specified the use of MOML directly in SIP (see section 3) 

      o  specified the <event> element for notifying events in SIP INFO 
         messages 

      o  added <gate> transform primitive which can gate the flow of 
         media regardless of its format  

      o  extended sending events to "source" to allow event names 
         specific to the source naming conventions to be included. This 
         can allow such features as the source relaying an event to 
         another MOML object it has created.

                 Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)         Aug 2004 
 
 
      o  modularized the language and specified rules to extend it in 
         order to allow it to be independently tailored to different 
         environments and  platforms (see section 4) 

   Between the -01 version and the -00 version the changes were:  

      o  added primitives to detect, send, and receive fax 

      o  added "xml:lang" attribute to <play> <audio> <var> and <tts>. 
         children of <play> inherit from play unless overridden. 

      o  allow the uri in <audio> to refer to a logical clip (physical 
         determined by language) and sequence as well as a physical clip 
         (for local uri references). 

      o  restructured the schema as a partial step towards 
         modularization and the ability to subset and extend the 
         language in a standards compliant manner.  

      o  made <dtmfgen> to be the same level as <play> and not a child 
         of <play> 

      o  changed "pipe" and "star" to be "serial" and "parallel" 

      o  made all termination events consistently use the root 
         "terminate". previously some primitives used the root  "stop" 

      o  changed "max" attribute to "iterate" for the <dtmf>, <pattern>, 
         <noinput>, and <nomatch>, and <speech> elements. 

      o  change "iterations" attribute of <play> and <audio> to 
         "iterate". 

      o  removed explicit "lhs" / "rhs" labeling of full duplex objects   

15. Future Work 

   Some of the likely functions to be added in future release of MOML 
   include: 

      o  further refinement to the schemas with respect to 
         modularization 

      o  algorithmic tone generation and detection 

      o  video and multimedia

16. XML Schema 

   The base MOML schema defines the <moml> element and includes all of 
   the modules which together define the full language. The <moml> 
   element defines that a given document may be either a request to a 
   media server or an event notified by a media server.
