1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

  For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
  RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
  accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
  Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
  RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
  [RFC2580].

2. Entity State

   The goal in adding state objects to the Entity MIB [RFC2737] is to
   define a useful subset of the possible state attributes that could
   be tracked for a given entity that both fit into the state models
   such as those used in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] as well as
   leverage existing well-deployed models. The entStateTable contains
   state objects that are a subset of the popular ISO/OSI states that
   are also defined in ITU's X.731 specification [X.731]. Objects are
   defined to capture administrative, operational and usage states. In
   addition there are further state objects defined to provide
   additional information for these three basic states.

   Administrative state indicates permission to use or prohibition
   against using the entity and is imposed through the management
   services.

   Operational state indicates whether or not the entity is physically
   installed and working. Note that unlike the ifOperStatus [RFC2863],
   this operational state is independent of the administrative state.

   Usage state indicates whether or not the entity is in use at a
   specific instance, and if so, whether or not it currently has spare
   capacity to serve additional users. In the context of this MIB, the
   usage state refers to the ability of an entity to service other
   entities within its containment hierarchy.

   Alarm state indicates whether or not there are any alarms active
   against the entity. In addition to those alarm states defined in
   X.731 [X.731], warning and indeterminate status are also defined to
   provide a more complete mapping to the Alarm MIB [RFC3877].

   Standby state indicates whether the entity is currently running as
   hot standby, cold standby or is currently providing service.

   The terms state and status are used interchangeably in this memo.


Chisholm & Perkins          Standards Track                     [Page 3]
                            Entity State MIB                January 2005



   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.1 Hierarchical State Management

   Physical entities exist within a containment hierarchy. Physical
   containment is defined by the entPhysicalContainedIn
   object[RFC2737]. This raises some interesting issues not addressed
   in existing work on state management.

   There are two types of state for an entity:

   1) The state of the entity independent of the states of its parents
   and children in its containment hierarchy. This is often referred to
   as raw state.

   2) The state of the entity, as it may be influenced by the state of
   its parents and children. This is often referred to as computed
   state.

   All state objects in this memo are raw state.

2.2 Entity Redundancy

   While this memo is not attempting to address the entire problem
   space around redundancy, the entStateStandby object provides an
   important piece of state information for entities, which helps
   identify which pieces of redundant equipment are currently providing
   service, and which are waiting in either hot or cold standby mode.

2.3 Physical Entity Users


   There are three ways to define the 'user' of a physical entity

   1. Direct Containment in physical hierarchy

   2. Anywhere in physical hierarchy

   3. As defined by a means outside the scope of this MIB. This could
   include logical interfaces that could run on a port, software that
   could run on a module, etc.

   Administrative, operational, alarm and standby state use all three
   definitions of 'user'. Usage state only supports the concept of
   direct containment to simplify implementations of this object.

                            Entity State MIB                January 2005


2.4 Physical Class Behaviour

   This MIB makes no effort to standardize on the behaviours and
   characteristics of the various physical classes [RFC2737], but
   rather how this information is reported. In looking at real-world
   products, items within the same physical class vary substantially.
   The MIB has therefore provided guidance on how to support objects
   where a particular instance of a physical class can not support part
   or all of a particular state.

3 Relation to other MIBs

3.1 Relationship to the Interfaces MIB


   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines the ifAdminStatus object, which
   has states of up, down and testing and the ifOperStatus object,
   which has states of up, down, testing, unknown, dormant, notPresent
   and lowerLayerDown.

   An ifAdminStatus of 'up' is equivalent to setting the entStateAdmin
   object to 'unlocked'. An ifAdminStatus of 'down' is equivalent to
   setting the entStateAdmin object to either 'locked' or
   'shuttingDown', depending on a systems interpretation of 'down'.

   An ifOperStatus of 'up' is equivalent to an entStateOper value of
   'enabled'. An ifOperStatus of 'down' due to operational failure is
   equivalent to an entStateOper value of 'disabled'. An ifOperStatus
   of 'down' due to being administratively disabled is equivalent to an
   entStateAdmin value of 'locked' and an entStateOper value of either
   'enabled' or 'disabled' depending on whether there are any known
   issues that would prevent the entity from becoming operational when
   its entStateAdmin is set to 'unlocked'.  An ifOperStatus of
   'unknown' is equivalent to an entStateOper value of 'unknown'. The
   ifOperStatus values of 'testing' and 'dormant' are not explicitly
   supported by this MIB, but the state objects will be able to reflect
   other aspects of the entities administrative and operational state.
   The ifOperStatus values of 'notPresent' and 'lowerLayerDown' are in
   some ways computed states and so are therefore not supported in this
   MIB. They can though be computed by examining the states of entities
   within this objects containment hierarchy and other available
   related states.



3.2 Relation to Alarm MIB

   The entStateAlarm object indicates whether or not there are any
   active alarms against this entity. If there are active alarms, then
   the alarmActiveTable in the Alarm MIB [Alarm MIB] should be searched
   for rows whose alarmActiveResourceId matches this entPhysicalIndex.



Chisholm & Perkins          Standards Track                     [Page 5]
                            Entity State MIB                January 2005


   Alternatively, if the alarmActiveTable is queried first and an
   active alarm with a value of alarmActiveResourceId that matches this
   entPhysicalIndex is found, then entStateAlarm can be used to quickly
   determine if there are additional active alarms with a different
   severity against this physical entity.

3.3 Relation to Bridge MIB

   For entities of physical type of 'port' that support the
   dot1dStpPortEnable object in the Bridge MIB [RFC1493], a value of
   'enabled' is equivalent to setting the entStateAdmin object to
   'unlocked'. Setting dot1dStpPortEnable to 'disabled' is equivalent
   to setting the entStateAdmin object to 'locked'.

3.4 Relation to the Host Resources MIB

   The hrDeviceStatus object in the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790]
   provides an operational state for devices. For entities that
   logically correspond to the concept of a device, a value of
   'unknown' for hrDeviceStatus corresponds to an entStateOper value of
   'unknown'. A value of 'running' corresponds to an entStateOper value
   of 'enabled'. A value of 'warning' also corresponds to an
   entStateOper value of 'enabled', but with appropriate bits set in
   the entStateAlarm object to indicate the alarms corresponding to the
   unusual error condition detected. A value of 'testing' or 'down' is
   equivalent to an entStateOper value of 'disabled'.

6. Security Considerations

   There is one management object - entStateAdmin - defined in this MIB
   that has a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. The object may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. 
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Note that setting the entStateAdmin to 'locked' or 'shuttingDown'
   can cause disruption of services ranging from those running on a
   port to those on an entire device, depending on the type of entity.
   Access to this object should be properly protected.

   Access to the objects defined in this MIB allows one to figure out
   what the active and standby resources in a network are. This
   information can be used to optimize attacks on networks so even
   read-only access to this MIB should be properly protected.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for


Chisholm & Perkins          Standards Track                    [Page 16]
                            Entity State MIB                January 2005


   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (entities) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
