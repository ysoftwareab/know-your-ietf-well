1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in [RFC8175].
   It provides the exchange of link related control information between
   DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP
   defines a base set of mechanisms as well as support for possible
   extensions.  This document defines one such extension.

   The base DLEP specification includes the Latency metric which
   provides a single latency value on a link, which is implementation
   dependent.  This document adds the ability to relay the minimum and
   maximum latency range seen on a link.  The extension defined in this
   document is referred to as "Latency Range".

   This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in Section 2
   which is used to indicate the use of the extension, and one new DLEP
   Data Item in Section 3.

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Extension Usage and Identification

   The use of the Latency Range Extension SHOULD be configurable.  To
   indicate that the Latency Range Extension is to be used, an
   implementation MUST include the Latency Range Extension Type Value in
   the Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported Data
   Item is sent and processed according to [RFC8175].

Internet-Draft        DLEP Latency Range Extension         November 2019


   Note: the usage of the extension defined in this document does not
   impact processing associated with the Latency Data Item defined in
   [RFC8175].

   The Latency Range Extension Type Value is TBA1, see Section 5.

3.  Latency Range Data Item

   The Latency Range Data Item serves much the same purpose as the
   Latency Data Item defined in [RFC8175] with the addition of being
   able to communicate the latency range that can be experienced by
   traffic on a link.  The Latency Range Data Item MUST be included in
   the Session Initialization Response Message, with default values to
   be used on a session-wide basis.  The Latency Range Data Item also
   MAY be carried in any message where the Latency Data Item [RFC8175]
   is allowed and is carried as an additional data item.  When present,
   the Latency Range Data Item MUST be processed according to the same
   rules as the Latency Data Item defined in [RFC8175].

   The format of the Latency Range Data Item is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Data Item Type                | Length                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        Maximum Latency                        :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                        Maximum Latency                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        Minimum Latency                        :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                        Minimum Latency                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Data Item Type:  TBA2

   Length:  16

   Maximum Latency:

      A 64-bit unsigned integer, representing the longest transmission
      delay, in microseconds, that a packet encounters as it is
      transmitted over the link.

   Minimum Latency:

Internet-Draft        DLEP Latency Range Extension         November 2019


      A 64-bit unsigned integer, representing the shortest transmission
      delay, in microseconds, that a packet can encounter as it is
      transmitted over the link.

4.  Security Considerations

   The extension introduces a new Data Item for DLEP.  The extension
   does not inherently introduce any additional vulnerabilities above
   those documented in [RFC8175].  The approach taken to Security in
   that document applies equally when running the extension defined in
   this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the assignment of two values by IANA.  All
   assignments are to registries defined by [RFC8175].

5.1.  Extension Type Value

   This document requests one new assignment to the DLEP Extensions
   Registry named "Extension Type Values" in the range with the
   "Specification Required" policy.  The requested value is as follows:

                         +------+---------------+
                         | Code | Description   |
                         +------+---------------+
                         | TBA1 | Latency Range |
                         +------+---------------+

                  Table 1: Requested Extension Type Value

5.2.  Data Item Value

   This document requests one new assignment to the DLEP Data Item
   Registry named "Data Item Type Values" in the range with the
   "Specification Required" policy.  The requested values are as
   follows:

                       +-----------+---------------+
                       | Type Code | Description   |
                       +-----------+---------------+
                       | TBA2      | Latency Range |
                       +-----------+---------------+
