    RSVP-TE Signaling Procedure for End-to-End GMPLS Restoration and
                             Resource Sharing
             draft-ietf-teas-gmpls-resource-sharing-proc-08


Abstract

   In non-packet transport networks, there are requirements where
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end
   recovery scheme needs to employ restoration Label Switched Path (LSP)
   while keeping resources for the working and/or protecting LSPs
   reserved in the network after the failure occurs.

   This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using
   Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   signaling in the context of GMPLS end-to-end recovery scheme when
   using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down.  In
   addition, this document discusses resource sharing-based setup and
   teardown of LSPs as well as LSP reversion procedures.  No new
   signaling extensions are defined by this document, and it is strictly
   informative in nature.

Internet-Draft   GMPLS Restoration and Resource Sharing January 26, 2017


1.  Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] defines
   a set of protocols, including Open Shortest Path First - Traffic
   Engineering (OSPF-TE) [RFC4203] and Resource ReserVation Protocol -
   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3473].  These protocols can be used
   to set up Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in non-packet transport
   networks.  The GMPLS protocol extends MPLS to support interfaces
   capable of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Lambda Switching and
   Fiber Switching.  These switching technologies provide several
   protection schemes [RFC4426][RFC4427] (e.g., 1+1, 1:N and M:N).

   Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   signaling has been extended to support various GMPLS recovery
   schemes, such as end-to-end recovery [RFC4872] and segment recovery
   [RFC4873].  As described in [RFC6689], an ASSOCIATION object with
   Association Type "Recovery" [RFC4872] can be signaled in the RSVP
   Path message to identify the LSPs for restoration.  Also, an
   ASSOCIATION object with Association Type "Resource Sharing" [RFC4873]
   can be signaled in the RSVP Path message to identify the LSPs for
   resource sharing.  [RFC6689] Section 2.2 reviews the procedure for
   providing LSP associations for GMPLS end-to-end recovery and Section
   2.4 reviews the procedure for providing LSP associations for sharing
   resources.

   Generally GMPLS end-to-end recovery schemes have the restoration LSP
   set up after the failure has been detected and notified on the
   working LSP.  For recovery scheme with revertive behavior, a
   restoration LSP is set up while working LSP and/or protecting LSP are
   not torn down in control plane due to a failure.  In non-packet
   transport networks, as working LSPs are typically set up over
   preferred paths, service providers would like to keep resources
   associated with the working LSPs reserved.  This is to make sure that
   the service can be reverted to the preferred path (working LSP) when
   the failure is repaired to provide deterministic behavior and
   guaranteed Service Level Agreement (SLA).

   In this document, we review procedures for GMPLS LSP associations,
   resource sharing based LSP setup, teardown, and LSP reversion for
   non-packet transport networks, including the following:

   o  Review the procedure for providing LSP associations for the GMPLS
      end-to-end recovery using restoration LSP where working and
      protecting LSPs are not torn down and resources are kept reserved
      in the network after the failure. 

   o  In [RFC3209], the make-before-break (MBB) method assumes the old
      and new LSPs share the SESSION object and signal Shared Explicit

      (SE) flag in SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object for sharing resources. 
      According to [RFC6689], an ASSOCIATION object with Association
      Type "Resource Sharing" in the Path message enables the sharing of
      resources across LSPs with different SESSION objects.  The
      procedure for resource sharing using the SE flag in conjunction
      with an ASSOCIATION object is discussed in this document. 

   o  When using end-to-end recovery scheme with revertive behavior,
      methods for LSP reversion and resource sharing are summarized in
      this document. 


   This document is strictly informative in nature and does not define
   any RSVP-TE signaling extensions.

3.  Overview

   The GMPLS end-to-end recovery scheme, as defined in [RFC4872] and
   being considered in this document, switches normal traffic to an
   alternate LSP that is not even partially established only after the
 


Zhang, et al             Expires July 30, 2017                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   GMPLS Restoration and Resource Sharing January 26, 2017


   working LSP failure occurs.  The new alternate route is selected at
   the LSP head-end node, it may reuse resources of the failed LSP at
   intermediate nodes and may include additional intermediate nodes
   and/or links. 

3.1.  Examples of Restoration Schemes

   Two forms of end-to-end recovery schemes, 1+R restoration and 1+1+R
   restoration are described in the following sections.  Other forms of
   end-to-end recovery schemes also exist and they can use these
   signaling techniques.

3.1.1.  1+R Restoration

   One example of the recovery scheme considered in this document is 1+R
   recovery.  The 1+R recovery scheme is exemplified in Figure 1.  In
   this example, a working LSP on path A-B-C-Z is pre-established. 
   Typically after a failure detection and notification on the working
   LSP, a second LSP on path A-H-I-J-Z is established as a restoration
   LSP.  Unlike a protecting LSP which is set up before the failure, a
   restoration LSP is set up when needed, after the failure.

              \                                /

             +--+--+       +-----+        +--+--+

             +-----+       +-----+        +-----+

          Figure 1: An Example of 1+R Recovery Scheme


   During failure switchover with 1+R recovery scheme, in general,
   working LSP resources are not released so that working and
   restoration LSPs coexist in the network.  Nonetheless, working and
   restoration LSPs can share network resources.  Typically when the
   failure has recovered on the working LSP, the restoration LSP is no
   longer required and is torn down while the traffic is reverted to the
   original working LSP.

3.1.2.  1+1+R Restoration

   Another example of the recovery scheme considered in this document is
   1+1+R.  In 1+1+R, a restoration LSP is set up for the working LSP
   and/or the protecting LSP after the failure has been detected, and

   this recovery scheme is exemplified in Figure 2.

             |  H  +-------+  I  +--------+  J  |
             +-----+       +-----+        +-----+

          Figure 2: An Example of 1+1+R Recovery Scheme


   In this example, a working LSP on path A-B-C-Z and a protecting LSP
   on path A-D-E-F-Z are pre-established.  After a failure detection and
   notification on the working LSP or protecting LSP, a third LSP on
   path A-H-I-J-Z is established as a restoration LSP.  The restoration
   LSP in this case provides protection against failure of both the
   working and protecting LSPs.  During failure switchover with 1+1+R
   recovery scheme, in general, failed LSP resources are not released so
   that working, protecting and restoration LSPs coexist in the network.
    The restoration LSP can share network resources with the working
   LSP, and it can share network resources with the protecting LSP. 
   Typically, the restoration LSP is torn down when the traffic is
   reverted to the original LSP and it is no longer needed.

   There are two possible models when using a restoration LSP with 1+1+R
   recovery scheme:

   o  A restoration LSP is set up after either a working or protecting
      LSP fails.  Only one restoration LSP is present at a time.

   o  A restoration LSP is set up after both working and protecting LSPs
      fail.  Only one restoration LSP is present at a time.


3.1.2.1.  1+1+R Restoration - Variants

   Two other possible variants exist when using a restoration LSP with
   1+1+R recovery scheme:

 


Zhang, et al             Expires July 30, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   GMPLS Restoration and Resource Sharing January 26, 2017


   o  A restoration LSP is set up after either a working or protecting
      LSP fails.  Two different restoration LSPs may be present, one for
      the working LSP and one for the protecting LSP.

   o  Two different restoration LSPs are set up after both working and
      protecting LSPs fail, one for the working LSP and one for the
      protecting LSP. 


   In all these models, if a restoration LSP also fails, it is torn down
   and a new restoration LSP is set up.

        +-----+    +-----+     +-----+      +-----+     +-----+

          Figure 3: Resource Sharing in 1+R Recovery Scheme


   Using the network shown in Figure 3 as an example using 1+R recovery
   scheme, LSP1 (A-B-C-D-E) is the working LSP, and assume it allows for
   resource sharing when the LSP traffic is dynamically restored.  Upon
   detecting the failure of a link along the LSP1, e.g. Link C-D, node A
   needs to decide which alternative path it will use to signal
   restoration LSP and reroute traffic.  In this case, A-B-C-F-G-E is
   chosen as the restoration LSP path and the resources on the path
   segment A-B-C are re-used by this LSP.  The working LSP is not torn
   down and co-exists with the restoration LSP.  When the head-end node
   A signals the restoration LSP, nodes C, F, G and E reconfigure the
   resources (as listed in Table 1 of this document) to set up the LSP
   by sending cross-connection command to the data plane.

   In the recovery scheme employing revertive behavior, after the
   failure is repaired, the resources on nodes C and E need to be
   reconfigured to set up the working LSP (using a procedure described
   in Section 4.3 of this document) by sending cross-connection command
   to the data plane.  The traffic is then reverted back to the original
   working LSP.

4.  RSVP-TE Signaling Procedure 

4.1.  Restoration LSP Association

   Where GMPLS end-to-end recovery scheme needs to employ a restoration
   LSP while keeping resources for the working and/or protecting LSPs
   reserved in the network after the failure, the restoration LSP is set
   up with an ASSOCIATION object that has Association Type set to
   "Recovery" [RFC4872], the Association ID and the Association Source
   set to the corresponding Association ID and the Association Source
   signaled in the Path message of the LSP it is restoring.  For
   example, when a restoration LSP is signaled for a failed working LSP,
   the ASSOCIATION object in the Path message of the restoration LSP
   contains the Association ID and Association Source set to the
   Association ID and Association Source signaled in the working LSP for
   the "Recovery" Association Type.  Similarly, when a restoration LSP
   is set up for a failed protecting LSP, the ASSOCIATION object in the
   Path message of the restoration LSP contains the Association ID and
   Association Source set to the Association ID and Association Source
   signaled in the protecting LSP for the "Recovery" Association Type.

   The procedure for signaling the PROTECTION object is specified in
   [RFC4872].  Specifically, the restoration LSP used for a working LSP
   is set up with P bit cleared in the PROTECTION object in the Path
   message of the restoration LSP and the restoration LSP used for a
   protecting LSP is set up with P bit set in the PROTECTION object in
   the Path message of the restoration LSP.

4.2.  Resource Sharing-based Restoration LSP Setup

   GMPLS LSPs can share resources during LSP setup if they have Shared
   Explicit (SE) flag set in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE objects [RFC3209] in
   the Path messages that create them and:

   o  As defined in [RFC3209], LSPs have identical SESSION objects
      and/or

   o  As defined in [RFC6689], LSPs have matching ASSOCIATION object
      with Association Type set to "Resource Sharing" signaled in their
      Path messages.  LSPs in this case can have different SESSION
      objects i.e. different Tunnel ID, Source and/or Destination
      signaled in their Path messages.

   As described in [RFC3209], Section 2.5, the purpose of make-before-
   break is not to disrupt traffic, or adversely impact network
   operations while TE tunnel rerouting is in progress.  In non-packet
   transport networks during the RSVP-TE signaling procedure, the nodes
   set up cross-connections along the LSP accordingly.  Because the
 


Zhang, et al             Expires July 30, 2017                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   GMPLS Restoration and Resource Sharing January 26, 2017


   cross-connection cannot simultaneously connect a shared resource to
   different resources in two alternative LSPs, nodes may not be able to
   fulfill this request when LSPs share resources.

   For LSP restoration upon failure, as explained in Section 11 of
   [RFC4872], the reroute procedure may re-use existing resources.  The
   action of the intermediate nodes during the rerouting process to
   reconfigure cross-connections does not further impact the traffic
   since it has been interrupted due to the already failed LSP.

   The node actions for setting up the restoration LSP can be
   categorized into the following:

   -----------------------------------+---------------------------------
   |        Category                  |        Action                  |
   -----------------------------------+---------------------------------
   | Reusing existing resource on     | This type of node needs to     |
   | both input and output interfaces | reserve the existing resources |
   | (nodes A & B in Figure 3).       | and no cross-connection        |
   |                                  | command is needed.             |
   -----------------------------------+---------------------------------
   | Reusing existing resource only   | This type of node needs to     |
   | on one of the interfaces, either | reserve the resources and send |
   | input or output interfaces and   | the re-configuration           |
   | using new resource on the        | cross-connection command to its|
   | other interfaces.                | corresponding data plane       |
   | (nodes C & E in Figure 3).       | node on the interfaces where   |
   |                                  | new resources are needed and   |
   |                                  | it needs to re-use the existing|

         Table 1: Node Actions During Restoration LSP Setup


   Depending on whether the resource is re-used or not, the node actions
   differ.  This deviates from normal LSP setup since some nodes do not
   need to re-configure the cross-connection.  Also, the judgment
   whether the control plane node needs to send a cross-connection setup
   or modification command to its corresponding data plane node(s)
   relies on the check whether the LSPs are sharing resources.

4.3.  LSP Reversion

   If the end-to-end LSP recovery scheme employs the revertive behavior,
   as described in Section 3 of this document, traffic can be reverted
   from the restoration LSP to the working or protecting LSP after its
   failure is recovered.  The LSP reversion can be achieved using two
   methods:

   1. Make-while-break Reversion, where resources associated with a
      working or protecting LSP are reconfigured while removing
      reservations for the restoration LSP.

   2. Make-before-break Reversion, where resources associated with a
      working or protecting LSP are reconfigured before removing
      reservations for the restoration LSP.

   In non-packet transport networks, both of the above reversion methods
   will result in some traffic disruption when the restoration LSP and
   the LSP being restored are sharing resources and the
   cross-connections need to be reconfigured on intermediate nodes.

4.3.1.  Make-while-break Reversion

   In this reversion method, restoration LSP is simply requested to be
   deleted by the head-end.  Removing reservations for restoration LSP
   triggers reconfiguration of resources associated with a working or
   protecting LSP on every node where resources are shared.  The working
   or protecting LSP state was not removed from the nodes when the
   failure occurred.  Whenever reservation for restoration LSP is
   removed from a node, data plane configuration changes to reflect
   reservations of working or protecting LSP as signaling progresses. 
   Eventually, after the whole restoration LSP is deleted, data plane
   configuration will fully match working or protecting LSP reservations
   on the whole path.  Thus reversion is complete.

   Make-while-break, while being relatively simple in its logic, has a
   few limitations as follows which may not be acceptable in some
   networks:

   o  No rollback

   If for some reason reconfiguration of data plane on one of the nodes
   to match working or protecting LSP reservations fails, falling back
   to restoration LSP is no longer an option, as its state might have
   already been removed from other nodes.

   o  No completion guarantee

   Deletion of an LSP provides no guarantees of completion.  In
   particular, if RSVP packets are lost due to a node or link failure it
   is possible for an LSP to be only partially deleted.  To mitigate
   this, RSVP could maintain soft state reservations and hence
   eventually remove remaining reservations due to refresh timeouts. 
   This approach is not feasible in non-packet transport networks
   however, where control and data channels are often separated and
   hence soft state reservations are not useful.

   Finally, one could argue that graceful LSP deletion [RFC3473] would
   provide guarantee of completion.  While this is true for most cases,
   many implementations will time out graceful deletion if LSP is not
   removed within certain amount of time, e.g. due to a transit node
   fault.  After that, deletion procedures which provide no completion
   guarantees will be attempted.  Hence, in corner cases a completion
   guarantee cannot be provided.

   o  No explicit notification of completion to head-end node

   In some cases, it may be useful for a head-end node to know when the
   data plane has been reconfigured to match working or protecting LSP
   reservations.  This knowledge could be used for initiating operations
   like enabling alarm monitoring, power equalization and others. 
   Unfortunately, for the reasons mentioned above, make-while-break
   reversion lacks such explicit notification.

4.3.2.  Make-before-break Reversion

   This reversion method can be used to overcome limitations of
   make-while-break reversion.  It is similar in spirit to MBB concept
   used for re-optimization.  Instead of relying on deletion of the
   restoration LSP, the head-end chooses to establish a new reversion
   LSP that duplicates the configuration of the resources on the working
   or protecting LSP, and uses identical ASSOCIATION and PROTECTION
   objects in the Path message of that LSP.  Only if setup of this LSP
   is successful will other (restoration and working or protecting) LSPs
   be deleted by the head-end.  MBB reversion consists of two parts:

   A) Make part: 

   Creating a new reversion LSP following working or protecting LSP's
   path.  The reversion LSP shares all of the resources of the working
   or protecting LSP and may share resources with the restoration LSP. 
   As reversion LSP is created, resources are reconfigured to match its
   reservations.  Hence, after reversion LSP is created, data plane
   configuration reflects working or protecting LSP reservations.

   B) Break part:

   After "make" part is finished, the original working or protecting and
   restoration LSPs are torn down, and the reversion LSP becomes the new
   working or protecting LSP.  Removing reservations for working or
   restoration LSPs does not cause any resource reconfiguration on
   reversion LSP's path - nodes follow same procedures as for "break"
   part of any MBB operation.  Hence, after working or protecting and
   restoration LSPs are removed, data plane configuration is exactly the
   same as before starting restoration.  Thus, reversion is complete.

   MBB reversion uses make-before-break characteristics to overcome
   challenges related to make-while-break reversion as follow:

   o  Rollback

   If "make" part fails, (existing) restoration LSP will still be used
   to carry existing traffic as the restoration LSP state was not
   removed.  Same logic applies here as for any MBB operation failure.

   o  Completion guarantee

   LSP setup is resilient against RSVP message loss, as Path and Resv
   messages are refreshed periodically.  Hence, given that network
   recovers from node and link failures eventually, reversion LSP setup
   is guaranteed to finish with either success or failure.

   o  Explicit notification of completion to head-end node

   Head-end knows that data plane has been reconfigured to match working
   or protecting LSP reservations on intermediate nodes when it receives
   Resv for the reversion LSP.


5.  Security Considerations
