1.  Introduction

  (1) The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) [RFC6830] splits current IP
  addresses in two different namespaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and
  Routing Locators (RLOCs). LISP uses a map-and-encap approach that relies on
  (1) a Mapping System (distributed database) that stores and disseminates
  EID-RLOC mappings and on (2) LISP tunnel routers (xTRs) that encapsulate
  and decapsulate data packets based on the content of those mappings.

  (2) H3 is a geospatial indexing system using a hexagonal grid that can be
  (approximately) subdivided into finer and finer hexagonal grids,
  combining the benefits of a hexagonal grid with hierarchical subdivisions.
  H3 supports sixteen resolutions. Each finer resolution has cells with one
  seventh the area of the coarser resolution. Hexagons cannot be perfectly
  subdivided into seven hexagons, so the finer cells are only approximately
  contained within a parent cell. Each cell is identified by a 64bit HID.

  (3) The Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) Industry Consortium investigates state-of-
  the-art technologies in computer vision and machine learning for automotive
  applications, and, for taxonomy of published automotive scene classification.

  These standards are combined to create an in-network state which reflects the
  condition of each hexagonal tile (~1sqm) in every road. The lisp network maps
  & encapsulates traffic between MobilityClient endpoint identifiers (EID), and
  addressable tile-objects (HID=>EID). objects are aggregated by H3Service EIDs.

  The H3-LISP mobility network bridges timing and location gaps between the
  production and consumption of information by MobilityClients:
   o vision, sensory, LIADR, AI applications -- information producers
   o driving-apps, map-apps, command & control -- information consumers

  This is achieved by putting the physical world on a shared addressable
  state-grid of road-segments digital-twins typically at the edge.
  Tile by tile geo-state sharing is done using a brokered-network of these
  digital-twins, an indirections which solves key issues in vehicle to vehicle
  information sharing. For example multiple perspectives, privacy and cyber
  security. These challenges arise when clients are directly communicate when
  they do not really need to, causing unnecessary many to many complexity and
  exposure.

  In non brokered v2v models, given a situation observable by some end-points,
  it is unclear if the relevant end-points which need to know will receive:
  i. consistent, ii. conflicting, iii. multiple, or iv. no indications.
  As an example, when a vehicle experiences a sudden highway slow-down,"sees"
  many brake lights or "feels" an accelerometer slowdown, there is  no clear way
  for it to share this annotation with vehicles 20-30sec away, and prevent a
  potential pile-up. Or, when a vehicle crosses an intersection, observing
  opposite-lane obstruction such as: construction, double-park, commercial
  loading, garbage truck, or stopped school-bus - there is no clear way for it to
  alert vehicles approaching the situation from another direction as it drives away.

  Geo-state indirection also helps communicate advanced machine vision and/or
  radar annotations. These are constantly evolving technologies, and relaying
  road enumerations they produce, using peer-to-peer protocols, poses a
  significant interoperability challenge. It is hard to test each new
  annotation of any sensor or OEM vendor with any other driving application.
  Brokered IP multicast channels are themed, subscribing means interoperating.

  These peer-to-peer limitations are inherent yet unnecessary, as in most road
  situations vehicles are not really proper peers. They just happen to be in the
  same place at the same time. H3-LISP mobility network solves these limitations
  of direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication by digital-twin broker per geo-tile.
  Bridging timing, security, privacy, and interoperability gaps. Twin brokering
  is achieved by MobilityClients communicating through addressable geo-states.
  Addressable tiles are aggregated and maintained by LISP H3ServiceEIDs.

  MobilityClients can provide drivers with heads-up alerts on hazards and obstacles
  beyond the line of sight of the driver and the in-car sensors: over traffic,
  around blocks, far-side junction, beyond road turns or surface curvatures.
  This highlights the importance of networks in providing road safety and the
  role networks play in future AV operation support systems (AV-OSS).

  Beyond sharing use cases like finding freed-up curb-parking and help avoid
  construction zones, a mission critical use case for global geo-pub-sub has to
  do with supporting autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets.

  Its now a consensus that as specific AV fleets start to role out, or regular
  cars with AV abilities become more perversive, that they need remote operations
  and remote take-over support. This means that for every M such cars there needs
  to be N human remote drivers ready to take over. These AV-OSS are put together
  by consortiums of multiple companies and are measured by their N/M.

  Nexagon geo-channels role in this context is two fold:

  1. flag tiles where the AV got confused because of current condition which is
     requiring remote intervention, so to steer other AVs away from this tile.
     This so not to pull-in more and more humans to intervene as more cars arrive.
  2. fleets will heavily rely on platoons, convoys assembled on the road on the
     fly, driven at the head by a remote operator or human driver. AVs need to
     lock-on. Geo channels are used pub-sub these platoons as they drive by.


  To summarize the H3-LISP solution outline:

  (1) MicroPartition: 64bit indexed geo-spatial H3.r15 road-tiles
  (2) EnumState: 64bit state values compile tile condition representation
  (3) Aggregation: H3.r9 H3ServiceEID group individual H3.r15 road-tiles
  (4) Channels: H3ServiceEIDs function as multicast state update channels
  (5) Scale: H3ServiceEIDs distributed for in-network for latency-throughput
  (6) Mapped Overlay: tunneled-network routes the mobility-network traffic
  (7) Signal-free: tunneled overlay is used to map-register for mcast channels
  (8) Aggregation: tunnels used between MobilityClients/H3ServiceEIDs <> edge
  (9) Access: ClientXTRs/ServerXTRs tunnel traffic to-from the LISP EdgeRTRs
  (10) Control: EdgeRTRs register-resolve H3ServiceEIDs and mcast subscription

  - MobilityClientA has seen MobilityClientB near future, and, vice versa
  - Clients share information using addressable shared-state routed by LISP Edge
  - ClientXTR (cXTR): tunnel encapsulation through access network to LISP Edge
  - ServerXTR (sXTR): tunnel encapsulation through  cloud network to LISP Edge
  - The H3-LISP Mobility overlay starts in the cXTR and terminates in the sXTR
  - The updates are routed to the appropriate tile geo-state by the LISP network
  - EdgeRTRs perform multicast replication to edges and then native or to cXTRs
  - Clients receive tile-by-tile geo-state updates via the multicast channels



  Each H3.r9 hexagon is an EID Service with corresponding H3 hexagon ID.
  Bound to that service is a LISP xTR, called a ServerXTR, specified to deliver
  encapsulated packets to and from the H3ServiceEID and LISP Edge. EdgeRTRs are
  used to re-tunnel packets from MobilityClients to H3ServiceEIDs. Each
  H3ServiceEID is also a multicast source for updating MobilityClients
  on the state of the H3.r15 tiles aggregated by the H3ServiceEID.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Definition of Terms

  H3ServiceEID: Is an addressable aggregation of H3.r15 state-tiles. It is a
     designated source for physical world reported annotations, and an (s,g)
     source of multicast public-safety update channels. H3ServiceEID is itself
     an H3 hexagon, large enough to provide geo-spatial conditions context, but
     not too large as to over-burden (battery powered, cellular connected)
     subscribers with too much information. For Mobility Network it is H3.r9.
     It has a light-weight LISP protocol stack to tunnel packets aka ServerXTR.
     The EID is an IPv6 EID that contains the H3 64-bit address numbering
     scheme. See IANA consideration for details.

  ServerXTR: Is a data-plane only LISP protocol stack implementation that co-exists
     with H3ServiceEID process. When the server roams, the xTR roams with it.
     The ServerXTR encapsulates and decapsulates packets to/from EdgeRTRs.

  MobilityClient: Is a roaming application that may be resident as part of an
     automobile, as part of a navigation application, part of municipal, state,
     of federal government command and control application, or part of live
     street view consumer type of application. It has a light-weight LISP
     protocol stack to tunnel packets aka ClientXTR.

  MobilityClient EID: Is the IPv6 EID used by the Mobility Client applications
     to source packets. The destination of such packets are only H3ServiceEIDs.
     The EID format is opaque and is assigned as part of the MobilityClient
     network-as-a-service (NaaS) authorization.

  ClientXTR: Is a data-plane only LISP protocol stack implementation that is
     co-located with the Mobility Client application. It encapsulates packets
     sourced by applications to EdgeRTRs and decapsulates packets from EdgeRTRs.

  EdgeRTR: Is the core scale and structure of the LISP mobility network.
     EdgeRTRs proxy H3ServiceEIDs and MobilityClient H3ServiceEID channel
     registration. EdgeRTRs aggregate MobilityClients and H3Services using
     tunnels to facilitate hosting-providers and mobile-hosting flexibility -
     for accessing the nexagon mobility network.  EdgeRTRs decapsulate packets
     from ClientXTRs, ServerXTRs and re-encapsulates packets to the clients and
     servers tunnels. EdgeRTRs glean H3ServiceEIDs and glean MobilityClient
     EIDs when they decapsulates packets. EdgeRTRs store H3ServiceEIDs and their
     own RLOC of where the H3ServiceEID is currently reachable from in the
     map-cache. These mappings are registered to the LISP mapping system so
     other EdgeRTRs know where to encapsulate for such EIDs. These mappings may
     also be provisioned by dev-ops when H3Services are provisioned and assigned
     EdgeRTRs. EdgeRTRs do not register MobilityClients' EIDs at the mapping
     service as  these are temporary-renewed while using the mobility network.
     Enterprises  may provide their own client facing EdgeRTRs to mask their
     clients geo-whereabouts while using the mobility network.


4.  Deployment Assumptions

   The specification described in this document makes the following
   deployment assumptions:

   (1) Unique 64-bit HID is associated with each H3 geo-spatial tile
   (2) MobilityClients and H3ServiceEIDs share this well known index
   (3) 64-bit BDD state value is associated with each H3-indexed tile
   (4) Tile state is compiled 16 fields of 4-bits, or max 16 enums

   Subscription of MobilityClients to the mobility network is constantly renewed
   while on the move and is not intended as a means of basic connectivity. This
   is why MobilityClients use DNS/AAA to obtain temporary EIDs and EdgeRTRs
   and why they use (LISP) data-plane tunnels to communicate using their
   temporary EIDs with the dynamically assigned EdgeRTRs.

   MobilityClient are otherwise unaware of the LISP network mechanism or mapping
   system and simply regard the data-plane tunnels as an application-specific
   virtual private network (VPN) that supports IPv6 EID addressable geo-state to
   publish (Ucast), Subscribe (Mcast) H3Services.

   In order to get access to the MobilityVPN, MobilityClients first authenticate
   with the MobilityVPN AAA Server. DIAMETER based AAA is typically done at the
   provider edge (PE) by edge gateways. However, the typical case involves several
   types of customer equipment connected by wireline, or by wireless to a
   specific service provider. The Mobility VPN, on the other hand,
   potentially overlays a number of wireless networks and cloud-edge
   providers. It also involves dozens of Car-OEM, Driving-Applications,
   Smart-infrastructure vendors. This is why we require clients to first go
   through AAA in order to get both a MobilityClientEID and EdgeRTR gateway RLOC
   opened.


   ClientXTR performs the following steps in order to use the mobility network:
   1) obtain the address of the mobility network AAA server using DNS
   2) obtain MobilityClientEID and EdgeRTR(s) from AAA server using DIAMETER
   3) renew authorization from AAA while using the mobility network T1 minutes

   Using this network login and re-login method we ensure that:
   - the MobilityClientEIDs serve as credentials with the specific EdgeRTRs
   - EdgeRTRs are provisioned to whitelist MobilityClient EIDs assigned to them
   - EdgeRTRs are not tightly coupled to H3.r9 areas for privacy/load-balance
   - Mobility Clients do not need to update EdgeRTRs while roaming in an area

   The same EdgeRTR may serve several H3.r9 areas for smooth ride continuity,
   and, several EdgeRTRs may load balance an H3.r9 area with high density of
   originating MobilityClient rides. When a MobilityClient ClientXTR is homed
   to EdgeRTR, it is able to communicate with H3ServiceEIDs.


5. Mobility Clients Network Services

  The mobility network functions as a standard LISP overlay.
  The overlay delivers unicast and multicast packets across:
   - multiple access-networks and radio-access specifications
   - multiple edie providers, public, private, and hybrid clouds

  We use data-plane XTRs in the stack of each mobility client and server.
  ClientXTRs and ServerXTRs are homed to one or more EdgeRTRs at the LISP edge.
  This structure allows for MobilityClients to "show up" at any time,
  behind any network provider in a given mobility network administrative
  domain, and for any H3ServiceEID to be instantiated, moved, or
  failed-over to any rack in any cloud-provider. The LISP overlay enables
  these roaming mobility network elements to communicate uninterrupted.
  This quality is insured by the LISP RFCs. The determination of identities for
  MobilityClients to always refer to the correct H3ServiceEID is insured by H3
  geo-spatial HIDs.

  There are two options for how we associate ClientXTRs with LISP EdgeRTRs:

  I. Semi-random load-balancing by DNS/AAA

  In this option we assume that in a given metro edge, a pool of EdgeRTRs can
  distribute the Mobility Clients load randomly between them and that EdgeRTRs
  are topologically more or less equivalent. Each RTR uses LISP to tunnel
  traffic to and from other EdgeRTRs for MobilityClient with H3Service exchanges.
  MobilityClients can (multi) home to EdgeRTRs while moving.

  II. Topological by anycast

  In this option we align an EdgeRTR with topological aggregation like in
  Evolved Packet or 5GCore aggregation. Mobility Clients are roaming in an
  area home to that RTR and so is the H3 Server. There is only one hop across
  the edge overlay between clients and servers and mcast replication is more
  focused, but clients need to keep re-homing as they move.

  To summarize the H3LISP mobility network layout:

   (1) Mobility-Clients traffic is tunneled via data-plane ClientXTRs
       ClientXTRs are (multi) homed to EdgeRTR(s)
   (2) H3ServiceEID traffic is tunneled via data-plane ServerXTR
       ServerXTRs are (multi) homed to EdgeRTR(s)
   (3) EdgeRTRs use mapping service to resolve Ucast HIDs to RTR RLOCs
       EdgeRTRs also register to (Source, Group) H3ServiceEID multicasts



       MobilityClients <> ClientXTR <Access Provider > EdgeRTR  v
                                                                v
       v      << Map-Assisted Mobility-Network Overlay <<       v
       v
       >> EdgeRTR <Cloud Provider> ServerXTR <> H3ServiceEID


6. Mobility Unicast and Multicast

  Regardless of the way a given ClientXTR was associated with an EdgeRTR,
  an authenticated MobilityClient EID can send: [64bitH3.15ID :: 64bitState]
  annotations to the H3.r9 H3ServiceEID. The H3.r9 EID can be calculated by
  clients algorithmically from the H3.15 localized annotation snapped-to-tile.

  The ClientXTR encapsulates MobilityClient EID and H3ServiceEID in a packet
  sourced from the ClientXTR with the destination of the EdgeRTR RLOC LISP port.
  EdgeRTRs then re-encapsulate annotation packets either to remote EdgeRTR
  (option 1) or to homed H3ServiceEID ServerXTR (option 2).
  The remote EdgeRTR aggregating H3ServiceEIDs re-encapsulates MobilityClient
  EID to the ServerXTR and from there to the H3ServiceEID.

  The headers consist of the following fields:

  Outer headers = 40 (IPv6) + 8 (UDP) + 8 (LISP) = 56
  Inner headers = 40 (IPv6) + 8 (UDP) + 4 (Nexagon Header) = 52
  1500 (MTU) - 56 - 52 = 1392 bytes of effective payload

  Nexagon Header Type allows for kv tupples of vkkk flooding
  Type 1:key-value, key-value.. 1392 / (8 + 8) = 87 pairs
  Type 2:value, key,key,key.. (1392 - 8) / 8 = 173 H3-R15 IDs

  Nexagon Header GZIP allows for compression, very effective for H3IDs
  Nexagon Header Reserved bits
  Nexagon Header kv count (in any format)

  To Summarize Unicast:

   (1) MobilityClients can send annotations which are localized to an H3.r15 tile
       These annotations are sent to an H3.r9 mobility H3ServiceEIDs
   (2) MobilityClient EID and H3ServiceEID HID are encapsulated:
         XTR <> RTR <> RTR <> XTR
       * RTRs can map-resolve re-tunnel HIDs
   (3) RTRs re-encapsulate original source-dest to ServerXTRs
       ServerXTRs decapsulate packets to H3ServiceEID


  Each H3.r9 Server is also an IP Multicast channel Source used to update
  subscribers on the aggregate state of the H3.r15 tiles in the H3.r9 Server.
  This forms a multipoint to multipoint state channel per H3 geo-location, where
  the H3 hairpin aggregation point has programable propagation functionality.


  We use rfc8378 signal-free multicast to implement mcast channels in the
  overlay. The mobility network has many channels, with only a few thousands of
  subscribers per channel. MobilityClients driving through or subscribing to an
  H3.r9 area can explicitly issue an rfc4604 MLDv2 in order to subscribe, or,
  may be subscribed implicitly by the EdgeRTR gleaning to ucast HID destination.

  The advantage of an explicit client MLDv2 registration as a trigger to rfc8378
  is that the clients manage their own mobility mcast handover according to their
  location-direction vectors, and that it allows for otherwise silent, or,
  non annotating clients. The advantage of EdgeRTR implicit registration is
  less signaling required.

  MLDv2 signaling messages are encapsulated between the ClientXTR and the LISP
  EdgeRTR, therefore there is no requirement for the underlying network to
  support native multicast. If native access multicast is supported (for example
  native 5G multicast), then MobilityClient registration to H3ServiceEID
  safety channels may be integrated with it, in which case the mobile packet-core
  (EPC) element supporting it (eNB) will use this standard to register with the
  appropriate H3.r9 channels in its area.

  Multicast update packets are of the following structure:

` The remote EdgeRTRs homing MobilityClients in turn replicate the packet to the
  MobilityClients registered with them.

  We expect an average of 600 H3.r15 tiles of the full 7^6 (~100K) possible in
  H3.r9 to be part of any road. The H3.r9 server can transmit the status of all
  600 or just those with meaningful states based on updated SLA and policy.


  To Summarize:

   (1) H3LISP Clients tune to H3.r9 mobility updates using rfc8378
       H3LISP Client issue MLDv2 registration to H3.r9 HIDs
       ClientXTRs encapsulate MLDv2 to EdgeRTRs who register (s,g)


   (2) ServerXTRs encapsulate updates to EdgeRTRs who map-resolve (s,g) RLOCs
       EdgeRTRs replicate mobility update and tunnel to registered EdgeRTRs
       Remote EdgeRTRs replicate updates to registered ClientXTRs



7.  Security Considerations

  The nexagon layer3 v2n network is inherently more secure and private
  then peer to peer alternatives because of the indirection. No car or
  infrastructure element communicates directly with MobilityClients.
  All information is conveyed using shared addressable geo-state.
  MobilityClients receive information only from network channels published by
  a trusted broker. MobilityClients have no indication as to the origin of the
  information. This is an important step towards better privacy, security,
  extendability, and interoperability compared with legacy layer2 protocols.


  In order to be able to use the nexagon mobility network for a given period,
  the mobility clients go through a DNS/AAA stage by which they obtain their
  clientEID identifiers-credentials and the RLOCs of EdgeRTRs they may use as
  gateways to the network. This MobilityClient <> EdgeRTR interface is the most
  sensitive in this network to privacy and security considerations.

  The traffic on the MobilityClient<>EdgeRTR interface is tunneled  and its UDP
  content may be encrypted; still, the EdgeRTR will know based on the LISP
  headers alone the MobilityClient RLOC and H3-R9 (~0.1sqkm) geo-spatial area
  to which a given client publishes or subscribes to.

  For this reason we envision the ability of enterprise or groups of users to
  "bring their own" EdgeRTRs. BYO-RTR masks individual clients' IP-RLOC to
  H3-R9 association and is pre-provisioned to be able to use the mapping system
  and be on a white-list of EdgeRTRs aggregating H3ServiceEIDs.

  Beyond this sensitive hop, the mapping system does not hold MobilityClientEIDs,
  and remote EdgeRTRs are only aware of MobilityClient ephemeral EIDs, not their
  actual IP RLOC or any other mobile-device identifiers. EdgeRTRs register in the
  mapping (s,g) H3-R9 multicast groups, but which clients reside beyond which
  EdgeRTR is not in the mapping system, only the AAA server is aware of that.
  The H3ServiceEIDs themselves decrypt and parse actual H3-R15 annotations;
  they also consider during this the MobilityClientEID credentials to avoid
  "fake-news", but again these are only temporary EIDs allocated to clients
  in order to be able to use the mobility network and not for their actual IP.

  H3Services are provisioned to their EdgeRTRs, in the EdgeRTRs, and optionally
  also in the mapping system.

  In summary of main risk mitigations for the lisp-nexagon interface we can say:

  (1) tapping: all communications are through dynamic tunnels therefore may be
  encrypted using IP-Sec or other supported point to point underlay standards.
  These are not static tunnels but lisp re-tunneling routers (RTRs) perform all
  nexagon Overlay aggregation.

  (2) spoofing: it is very hard to guess a MobilityClientEID valid for a short
  period of time. Clients and H3Services EIDs are whitelisted in EdgeRTRs,
  Clients using the AAA procedure, H3Services via dev-ops.

  (3) impersonating: efforts to use MobilityClients and H3Services RLOCs should
  be caught by the underlying service provider edge and access networks. EID
  impersonating is caught by EdgeRTR EID RLOC whitelist mismatch.

  (4) credibility: the interface crowd-sources geo-state and does not assume to
  trust single detections. Credit history track to MobilityClientEIDs by as part
  of normal H3Services fact checking, aggregate scores affect AAA credentials.

  (5) privacy: Only EdgeRTRs are aware of both clients' RLOC and geo-location,
  only AAA is aware of client IDs credentials and credit but not geo-location.
  aggregate credit score span all H3Services administratively without source.
