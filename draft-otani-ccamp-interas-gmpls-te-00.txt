               1. Introduction 
                   
                  Since basic sets of GMPLS protocols have been so far standardized, 
                  CCAMP WG proposed to start to discuss about MPLS/GMPLS inter-domain 
                  traffic engineering (TE) [Inter-domain].  To proceed with this work, 
                  scalability and operational efficiency considering an actual 
                  networking environment is quite significant. 
                   
                  TE information exchanged over domains (areas or ASes) for controlling 
                  GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is more stringent than that of MPLS 
                  LSPs [MPLS-AS] from the point of an effective operation, because in 
                  order to dynamically or statically establish GMPLS LSPs, the 
                  additional TE information to the conventional MPLS-TE must be 
                  considered to be exchanged, such as switching capability, bandwidth 
                  encoding, and so forth. 
                   
                  This document describes the necessity of dynamic or static TE 
                  information exchange between GMPLS-controlled ASes as well as the 
                  requirement of TE parameters for this routing operation. 
                   
                   
               2. Conventions used in this document 
                   
                  In this document the steps for walking a pull-down tree are indented 
                  on subsequent lines. This allows abbreviation rather than a barrage 
                  of 'then click' or 'select' strings in a paragraph form. Example: 
                   
                   
                  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
                  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
                  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 
                   
                
               3. Assumed network model 
                   
                  3.1 GMPLS network model 
                   
                  Here, we assumed the below network model consisting of two GMPLS ASes.  
                  Each GMPLS AS is connected via traffic engineering (TE) links with a 
                  certain value of bandwidth (bw is, for example, 2.5Gbit/s, 10Gbit/s, 
                  etc.) between different GMPLS AS boarder nodes (A3-B1 and A4-B2).  
                  Moreover, each nodes in both AS 1 and AS 2 support x and y switching 
                  capability (x or y means TDM, Lambda or lambda).  The edge node of 
                  the network (possibly A1, A2, B3, B4) may have the switching 
                  capability of packet (psc).  Moreover, each TE link has a z or w 
                  encoding type (z or w means SONET/SDH, Lambda, Ethernet, etc).

                                Figure 1: GMPLS Inter AS network model(1) 
                   
                   
                  Between GMPLS AS border nodes, the routing information is statically 
                  or dynamically exchanged.  Link management protocol (LMP) [LMP] may 
                  be applied to maintain and manage TE links between GMPLS AS border 
                  nodes.   
                   
                  In general, the attributes of two TE-Links (A1-B3 and A4-B2) between 
                  AS border nodes as well as switching capability of each border node 
                  shall not be always same.  Therefore, GMPLS nodes shall identify the 
                  attributes of these TE-Links and border nodes in order to create LSP 
                  over multiple ASes.  The conventional MPLS technology does not 
                  provide the functionality to discriminate such attributes. 
                   
                   
                  3.2 MPLS network model 
                   
                  In the conventional MPLS network, we can assume MPLS Inter AS network 
                  model as below.  There are no routing constraints such as switching 
                  capability and encoding type, compared to the GMPLS Inter AS network 
                  model.  All nodes have the same switching capability of packet.

                  In the following section, we consider a MPLS or GMPLS path setup from 
                  an edge node in AS 1 to an edge node in AS2.

               4. Clarification of necessity of dynamic or static information exchange 
               between GMPLS Inter ASes 
                   
                   
                  4.1 Interface Switching capability 
                   
                  A constraint of bandwidth in GMPLS controlled network is different 
                  from that of IP/MPLS network.  In Figure 2, two TE links with 
                  different values of bandwidth such as 2.5 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s are 
                  assumed.  If an MPLS LSP with 2.5 Gbit/s bandwidth is established 
                  from A2 to B4 in Figure 2, two set of TE links (A2-A4-B2-B4 and A2-
                  A1-A3-B1-B3-B4) can be selected. 
                   
                  In the case of GMPLS inter ASes, the ingress node is beneficial to 
                  know switching capabilities supported in each AS when a route for a 
                  GMPLS-LSP across multiple ASes is computed.  For a request of GMPLS-
                  LSP setup, the ingress node determine the appropriate next-hop AS, 
                  which is capable of desired switching capability, if such information 
                  is exchanged between GMPLS ASes. 
                   
                  Here, we assume a switching capability as Lambda and an encoding type 
                  as lambda, as shown in Figure 3.  The bandwidth of each TE link is, 
                  for example, corresponding to the transponderÆs bit rate of each DWDM 
                  channel.   
                   
                  As shown in Figure 3, a GMPLS LSP with 2.5 Gbit/s can not be 
                  established over a set of TE links (A2-A4-B2-B4) because all nodes 
                  support only LSC which can not deal with sub-rate switching and the 
                  10 Gbit/s TE link can only support a GMPLS LSP with 10 Gbit/s.   
                   
                  If multiple GMPLS routes exist for a destination in a different AS, a 
                  path should be selected satisfying these routing constraints, in 
                  addition to the conventional EGP attributes.  Although an operator 
                  may want to specify the AS border node explicitly for such a 
                  destination, this TE information exchange will improve operational 
                  efficiency in GMPLS-controlled networks.  Therefore, not only IGP 
                  [GMPLS-Routing] but also EGP should advertise this TE parameter.

                  4.2 Bandwidth 
                   
                  The advertisement of the available bandwidth over GMPLS inter ASes is 
                  strongly dependent on the operational policy in each GMPLS ASes.  The 
                  resource available for different ASes may be advertised over GMPLS 
                  inters ASes, although the actual bandwidth is more than that for 
                  different ASes.  The GMPLS Border nodes have the functionality to 
                  control the advertised resource bandwidth reached to a destination.  
                  For example, even if 4 times OC-48 bandwidth exists to a destination 
                  in one GMPLS AS, the AS may advertise only twice OC-48 bandwidth to 
                  another GMPLS AS, following the mutual policy between these two ASes.  
                   
                   
                  4.3 Encoding type 
                   
                  Here, TE links with a different encoding type in a GMPLS Inter AS 
                  network are assumed as in Figure 3.  In this case, differing from the 
                  case of a MPLS inter AS network, a GMPLS LSP with a specific encoding 
                  type must be established to satisfy this constraint.  Since physical 
                  layer technologies used to form TE links limits the signal encoding 
                  type to be transported, the ingress node should consider this by 
                  obtaining TE parameters exchanged between GMPLS-controlled inter-ASes

                  4.4 Mixed case 
                   
                  Here, we consider a mixed case of 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, and assume two 
                  ASes: AS 1 consisting of GMPLS nodes with LSC and TE links with 
                  Lambda encoding type at 2.5 Gbit/s, and AS 2 consisting of GMPLS 
                  nodes with TDM-SC and TE links with SONET/SDH encoding type at 10 
                  Gbit/s.  GMPLS nodes in AS 2 support sub-rate switching, for example, 
                  of 2.5 Gbit/s.

                                Figure 5: GMPLS Inter AS network model (4) 
                   
                   
                  If a GMPLS LSP with 2.5 Gbit/s is established from A2 to B3, the 
                  ingress node should know not only the reachability of B3 in AS 2 but 
                  also the sub-rate (TDM) switching capability of nodes in AS 2 and 
                  available bandwidth to the destination.  In this sense, an end-point 
                  (reachability) list consisting of node IDs, interface addresses, 
                  interface IDs per switching capability is very useful and may be 
                  advertised over GMPLS ASes. 
                   
                  Operators may usually use a different switching capable nodes and 
                  different TE link with different encoding type and bandwidth, decided 
                  by their business strategy and such TE information exchange is 
                  expected to improve operational efficiency in GMPLS-controlled 
                  networks. 
                   
                   
                  4.5 SRLG 
                   
                  To configure a secondary LSP in addition to a primary LSP over 
                  multiple GMPLS ASes, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) parameter is very 
                  significant.  By introducing this parameter, the source node can 
                  route these LSPs so as to across the different AS boarder node as 
                  well as satisfy a SRLG constraint. 
                   
                  The SRLG over multiple ASes may be determined as a globally unique in 
                  order to guarantee the SRLG diversity. 
                   
                   
               5. Requirement of TE parameters to be supported for EGP 
                   
                  Coinciding with MPLS Inter AS work, the TE parameters for GMPLS Inter 
                  AS is considered to be added. 
                   
                  A GMPLS AS border node is required to announce the below parameters 
                  in terms of node IDs, interface addresses and interface IDs, of which 
                  reachability is advertised via EGP.

                  As mentioned in section 4.4, an end-point (reachability) list 
                  consisting of node IDs, interface addresses, interface IDs per 
                  switching capability is formed in order to be advertised over GMPLS 
                  ASes.
