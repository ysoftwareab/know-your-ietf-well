   Filters for Mobile Ad hoc networks (NOMADHOC) introduces a set of 
   extensions applicable to a range of ad hoc networking protocols that 
   allow an ad hoc node to distribute its active flows across multiple 
   routing paths. These extensions are based on the filter structure

   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile Ad hoc Networks   October 2003 
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Filters for mobile ad hoc networks (NOMADHOC) enables the 
   distribution of IP flows across multiple ad hoc paths with the help 
   of a subset of NOMAD filters [2,3]. The proposed solution is general 
   and as such, is applicable to a range of ad hoc routing protocols. 
    
   Filters for mobile ad hoc networks (NOMADHOC) provides extensions 
   that enable ad hoc nodes to associate flows with specific ad hoc 
   paths during the route discovery process. In this manner, each flow 
   will be routed over an ad hoc path until either the flow is 
   terminated or the path seizes to exist. The association of flows and 
   paths takes place with the help of Filters. 
    
   The base specification of ad hoc routing protocols such as DSR[4] and 
   TORA[5]) provide a built-in capability for the discovery of multiple 
   routing paths. In contrast, AODV[6] keeps only a single routing path 
   between the originator and the destination.  
    
   This draft explains the way by which Filters can be associated with 
   different discovered ad hoc paths between the originator and the 
   destination, in order to distribute flows or packets of a flow among 
   them. These Filters are composed by criteria predicates such as 
   protocol number, port number, etc. that are meant to identify one or 
   more flows. 
    
   This draft further looks into ways of maintaining multiple routing 
   paths where this feature is not supported, with minimal impact to the 
   base specification of the respective ad hoc routing protocol  
   The rules by which an originating node decides on the set of Filters 
   are considered beyond the scope of this document. It can be a 
   consideration of parameters like number of hop counts, RTT etc.  
    
   This draft introduces the ÊF∆ bit to the controlling messages of ad 
   hoc protocols. This bit, when set, informs the originator and the 
   destination that NOMADHOC extensions are applicable and to cater for 
   holding distinct multiple routing paths between the end nodes and to 
   distribute flows based on the defined filters. Section 3 of this 
   document explains how filters for mobile ad hoc networks (NOMADHOC) 
   is applied for different ad hoc protocols and section 4 explains the 
   filtering extensions used.

3 NOMADHOC Protocol Overview 
    
   This section provides an overview of how filters for ad hoc 
   networking protocols can be realized for various ad hoc routing 
   protocols.  
    
3.1 Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol 
    
   NOMADHOC is applicable for AODV only when the originator maintains 
   distinct multiple routing paths to the same destination. These 
   routing paths can be maintained through one interface or through 
   multiple interfaces at both originator and the destination. 
    
 3.1.1 AODV Control messages 
    
   The `F≥ bit, is introduced in the RREQ, RREP, and RREP-ACK messages. 
   It notifies all originator and destination AODV nodes that they 
   should deploy the NOMADHOC extension.

        by different next hop as defined in 3.2.1.2. Both F & A bits

   3.1.2 Enabling Multiple routing Paths 
    
   This section explains only the changes made to the base specification 
   of AODV protocol[6] during the route discovery process for the 
   discovery of distinct multiple routing paths between the originator 
   and the destination. 
    
   3.1.2.1 Processing of FRREQ 
    
   The originator MUST set both F & D bits of RREQ (FRREQ). Then FRREQ 
   is sent as defined in [6]. Intermediate node MUST process FRREQ as 
   defined in [6]. The destination node MUST process FRREQ received by 
   different previous hops separately.   
    
   3.1.2.4 Processing of FRREP 
    
   The destination node MUST generate a RREP with both F bit AND A bit 
   set (FRREP). If FRREQs come from different hops, the destination node 
   generates multiple FRREPs that are in turn unicasted to the hop from 
   which the FRREQ was received. Intermediate nodes receiving a FRREP 
   MUST process them as defined in [6]. The originating node MUST 
   process different FRREP received by different intermediate nodes 
   separately. 
    
   3.1.2.5 Processing FRREP-ACK  
    
   Filtering extensions MUST be attached on RREP-ACK with the F bit set 
   (FRREP-ACK), in response to a FRREP . The originating node MUST 
   unicast FRREP-ACK together with filtering extensions for each FRREP 
   received from distinct nodes. Each intermediate node SHOULD process 
   the RREP-ACK as defined in [6]. The destination node MUST process the 
   filtering extensions as defined in section 3.1.3, when receiving 
   FRREP-ACK. 
    
 3.1.3 Applying Filters 
    
   An originating node receiving multiple FRREPs SHOULD send respond 
   with a separate FRREP-ACK. Each FRREP-ACK May containing a different 
   set of filtering extensions. Formats of the filtering extensions are 
   defined in section 4.  
    
   A Filter is consisted of one or more Filter Modules and is 
   terminated by a Filter Control Extension. A Filter Module defines 
   one single filtering criteria. There is an AND relationship between 
   Filter Modules of the same Filter. In order for a flow to match a 
   Filter, it is required to qualify for all of the Filter Modules 
   contained in the Filter. Filter management is performed with the 
   help of the Filter Control Extension. It contains a Filter∆s Index 
   and a Weight field. The Index identifies a Filter for a given node 
   uniquely while the Weight field indicates the relative amount of 
   traffic for which a Filter is applicable. 
    
   When a destination is processing a FRREP-ACK sent by an originating 
   node, it is required to associate the contained Filters with the 
   acknowledged AODV path. Both originating and destination nodes

   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile Ad hoc Networks   October 2003 
    
   SHOULD keep a routing entry associated with the filters defined in 
   section 4. Filters are associated with the different next hops of 
   each routing path. When sending a packet by an originating node or a 
   destination node, it is required to identify whether the packet 
   matches any of the Filters associated with the routing entry.  
    
   If a matching routing entry is found, then the packet is forwarded 
   to the respective next hop with respect to its Weight value. For a 
   unique filter identified by an Index number, Weight value is 
   irrelevant and whole of the flow is forwarded to the respective next 
   hop. If filters refer to a single flow, then packets of the flow are 
   distributed between the multiple routing paths with respect to the 
   Weight value of each Filter. If no matching Filter is found then the 
   packet is handled as indicated by the Default Filter.  
    
   Each Filter remains valid for the lifetime of the corresponding 
   routing path.  
    
   The Default Filter SHOULD always be defined with the index number of 
   zero. 
    
 3.1.4 Model of operations 
    
   Figure 1 illustrates an example of multiple physical paths between 
   the originating and the destination nodes (S,D). In the beginning, 
   node S initiates a route discovery process as defined in section 
   3.1.2 to determine available paths to D. Eventually two physically 
   separated routing paths between S & D will be discovered. i.e, 
   Path 1: via P & Q; 
   Path 2: via T, R, W & X

   In figure 1, initially S broadcasts a single FRREQ that propagates 
   towards D over two physically different paths. Between nodes T and W 
   exists an additional sub-path, which is ignored. D responds to the 
   receipt of two identical FRREQs over nodes Q and W with the unicast 
   transmission of two FRREPs to S. The receipt of two identical FRREPS 
   at node S over P and T will acknowledge the existence of two 
   physically different paths between S and D. Finally, S responds with 
   the transmission of two unicast FRREP-ACKs containing the Filters to 
   be used for each path. The Filters will get applied at node S, who is 
   also the initiator of the flows. When returning traffic the reverse 
   Filters should be applied at the node D. 
    
   Assuming that S maintains two active flows denoted with Êa∆ and Êb∆. 
   Figure 2 shows the flow distribution applied as requested by S. (S 
   sends the flow Êa∆ over the shortest delay path of 1, while flow Êb∆ 
   is sent over the other path of 2).

                     Figure 2 distributions of flows 
 
   This example shows the distribution of 2 flows, over the 2 distinct 
   routing paths available. For the same example, a single flow MAY also 
   be distributed with respect to the Weight value. The extensions 
   presented in this document do not provide any restriction as to how 
   many distinct routing paths that an originating node SHOULD maintain. 
    
 3.1.5 Backward compatibility with RFC 3561 
 
   If the RREQ, RREP and RREP-ACK messages do not have the F flag set, 
   the processing of the RREQ, RREP and RREP-ACK is same as [6].

3.2 DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) 
 
   As defined in [4], DSR has a built-in capability to keep multiple 
   routing paths between the destination and the originating node in its 
   routing cache. The filtering extensions defined in section 4 can be 
   applied for DSR too to distinguish flows between available paths, 
   when choosing the particular route.  
 
 
4. NOMADHOC Extensions 
 
   In this section, the new NOMADHOC extensions required for the 
   support of Filters for ad hoc networking are specified.  
    
   To form a valid Filter, at least one of the extensions 1 to 6, 
   termed as Filter Modules, must be included. Extension 7 must appear 
   once in every Filter following all Filter Modules. In Filter 
   modules, the leftmost bit of the Sub-Type field (I bit) is used to 
   determine whether the rules included in the Filter Module are 
   positive or negative. In the first case a flow is required to match 
   exactly the Filter Module while in the second, the inverted (NOT) 
   rule. Due to the ÊI∆ bit in the Sub-Type field, two different Sub-
   Type values are given.  
    
      1. Behavior Aggregate Filters Extension (BAF)  
    
        Specifies to Filters data packets dependent of the content of 
        the DSCP field.  
    
      2. Protocol Extension  
         Specifies one or more protocols to be filtered.  
        
      3. Source Port Extension  
         Specifies one or more source ports to be filtered.  
        
      4. Source Port Range Extension  
         Specifies one or more ranges of source ports to be filtered.  
        
      5. Destination Port Extension  
         Specifies one or more destination ports to be filtered.  
        
      6. Destination Port Range Extension  
         Specifies one or more ranges of destination ports to be         
         filtered.  
        
      7. Filter Control Extension  
         It contains a Filter∆s unique identifier, called the Index         
         along with the Filter∆s Weight factor.
