Abstract

   Photuris is a session-key management protocol.  Extensible Exchange-
   Schemes are provided to enable future implementation changes without
   affecting the basic protocol.

   Additional authentication attributes are included for use with the IP
   Authentication Header (AH).

   Additional confidentiality attributes are included for use with the
   IP Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP).

1.  Additional Exchange-Schemes

   The packet format and basic facilities are already defined for Pho-
   turis [RFC-zzzz].

   These optional Exchange-Schemes are specified separately, and no sin-
   gle implementation is expected to support all of them.

   This document defines the following values:

   (3)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 3.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.

         The Key-Generation-Function is "MD5 Hash".

         The Privacy-Method is "Simple Masking".

         The Validity-Method is "MD5-IPMAC Check".                       |

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (4)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 2.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         When the Exchange-Scheme Size field is zero, includes by refer-
         ence all of the moduli specified in the list of Offered-Schemes
         for Scheme #2.

         The Key-Generation-Function is "MD5 Hash".

         The Privacy-Method is "DES-CBC over Mask".

         The Validity-Method is "MD5-IPMAC Check".                       |

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (5)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 5.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         erator (g).  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero, the
         pair [g,p] is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.  Each is encoded in a separate     |
         Variable Precision Integer (VPI).  The generator VPI is fol-    |
         lowed by (concatenated to) the modulus VPI, and the result is

2.  Additional Key-Generation-Function
2.1.  SHA1 Hash

   SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] is used as a pseudo-random-function for generating
   the key(s).  The key(s) begin with the most significant bits of the
   hash.  SHA1 is iterated as needed to generate the requisite length of
   key material.

   When an individual key does not use all 160-bits of the last hash,
   any remaining unused (least significant) bits of the last hash are
   discarded.  When combined with other uses of key generation for the
   same purpose, the next key will begin with a new hash iteration.

3.  Additional Privacy-Methods
3.1.  DES-CBC over Mask

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Privacy-Key Computation", sufficient pri-
   vacy-key material is generated to match the message length, beginning
   with the next field after the SPI, and including the Padding.  The
   message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated to generate a DES key.
   The most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of the generated hash are used
   for the privacy-key, and the remainder are discarded.  Although
   extremely rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys
   [Schneier95, pages 280-282] are discarded.  The Key-Generation-
   Function is iterated until a valid key is obtained.

   The least significant bit of each key byte is ignored (or set to par-
   ity when the implementation requires).

   Message encryption begins with the next field after the SPI, and con-
   tinues to the end of the data indicated by the UDP Length.


3.2.  DES-EDE3-CBC over Mask

   This is "Triple DES" outer-CBC EDE encryption (and DED decryption)
   with three 56-bit keys [KR96].

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Privacy-Key Computation", sufficient pri-
   vacy-key material is generated to match the message length, beginning
   with the next field after the SPI, and including the Padding.  The
   message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated (at least) three times
   to generate the three DES keys.  The most significant 64-bits (8
   bytes) of each generated hash are used for each successive privacy-
   key, and the remainder are discarded.  Each key is examined sequen-
   tially, in the order used for encryption.  A key that is identical to
   a previous key MUST be discarded.  Although extremely rare, the 64
   weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95, pages 280-282]
   MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is iterated until a
   valid key is obtained before generating the next key.

   In all three keys, the least significant bit of each key byte is
   ignored (or set to parity when the implementation requires).

   Message encryption begins with the next field after the SPI, and con-
   tinues to the end of the data indicated by the UDP Length.

4.  Additional Validity-Method
4.1.  SHA1-IPMAC Check

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Validity Verification", the Verification  |
   field value is the SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] hash over the concatenation of

      SHA1( key, keyfill, data, datafill, key, sha1fill )                |

   where the key is the computed verification-key.                       |

   The keyfill and datafill use the same pad-with-length technique       |
   defined for sha1fill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does
   not appear in the datagram.                                           -

   The resulting Verification field is a 160-bit Variable Precision      |
   Integer (22 bytes including Size).


5.  Additional Attributes

   The attribute format and basic facilities are already defined for
   Photuris [RFC-zzzz].

   These optional attributes are specified separately, and no single
   implementation is expected to support all of them.

   This document defines the following values:

     Use    Type
      I       4  SHA1-IPMAC Symmetric Identification                     |

   Attribute        4

   Length           0

   When selected as an Identity-Choice, the immediately following Iden-
   tification field contains an unstructured Variable Precision Integer. |
   Valid Identifications and symmetric secret-keys are preconfigured by
   the parties.

   There is no required format or content for the Identification value.
   The value may be a number or string of any kind.  See [RFC-zzzz] "Use
   of Identification and Secrets" for details.

   The symmetric secret-key (as specified) is selected based on the con- |
   tents of the Identification field.  All implementations MUST support
   at least 62 bytes.  The selected symmetric secret-key SHOULD provide
   at least 80-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Identity Verification", the Verification  |
   field value is the SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] hash over the concatenation of:

      SHA1( key, keyfill, data, datafill, key, sha1fill )                |

   where the key is the computed verification-key.                       |

   The keyfill and datafill use the same pad-with-length technique       |
   defined for sha1fill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does
   not appear in the datagram.                                           -

   The resulting Verification field is a 160-bit Variable Precision      |
   Integer (22 bytes including Size).

   For both [RFC-zzzz] "Identity Verification" and "Validity Verifica-   |
   tion", the verification-key is the SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] hash of the fol- |
   lowing concatenated values:                                           |

    + the symmetric secret-key,                                          |
    + the computed shared-secret.                                        |

   For [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the symmetric secret-key is |
   used directly as the generation-key.                                  |

   The symmetric secret-key is used in calculations in the same fashion  |
   as [RFC-zzzz] "MD5-IPMAC Symmetric Identification".

   |   Attribute   |    Length     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Attribute        6

   Length           0

   May be selected as an AH or ESP Attribute-Choice, pursuant to
   [RFC-1852] et sequitur.  The selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide
   at least 80-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the most sig-
   nificant 384-bits (48 bytes) of the Key-Generation-Function itera-
   tions are used for the key.

   Profile:

      When negotiated with Photuris, the transform differs slightly from
      [RFC-1852].

      The form of the authenticated message is:

         SHA1( key, keyfill, datagram, datafill, key, sha1fill )

      where the key is the SPI session-key.

      The additional datafill protects against the attack described in
      [PO96].  This is also filled to the next 512-bit boundary, using
      the same pad-with-length technique defined for SHA1.  This padding
      and length is implicit, and does not appear in the datagram.       -

   May be selected as an ESP Attribute-Choice, pursuant to [RFC-1829] et
   sequitur.  The selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide at least
   56-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the most sig-
   nificant 64-bits (8 bytes) of the Key-Generation iteration are used
   for the key, and the remainder are discarded.  Although extremely
   rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95,
   pages 280-282] MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is
   iterated until a valid key is obtained.

   The least significant bit of each key byte is ignored (or set to par-
   ity when the implementation requires).

   Profile:

   most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of each iteration are used for
   each successive key, and the remainder are discarded.  Each key is
   examined sequentially, in the order used for encryption.  A key that
   is identical to a previous key MUST be discarded.  Although extremely
   rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95,
   pages 280-282] MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is
   iterated until a valid key is obtained before generating the next
   key.

   In all three keys, the least significant bit of each key byte is
   ignored (or set to parity when the implementation requires).

   Note that this attribute may appear multiple times in the same ESP
   attribute list, both before and after an encryption transform.  For
   example,

      "XOR",
      "DES Decryption",
      "XOR",
      "DES-CBC Encryption",
      "XOR",

   would be one possible combination with Triple DES.


Security Considerations

   The "whitening" of the plaintext before DES encryption is intended to
   obscure the relation of the number of parties and SPIs active between
   two IP nodes.  The combination of a randomized secret mask with the
   CBC IV generates a different initial encrypted block for every SPI
   creation message.

   This obscurement is less effective when the SPI and SPILT are invari-
   ant or are not created for a particular exchange direction.  The num-
   ber of parties could be revealed by the number of exchanges with dif-
   ferences in the initial encrypted blocks.


Acknowledgements

   Phil Karn was principally responsible for the design of party privacy
   protection, and provided much of the design rationale text (now
   removed to a separate document).

   William Simpson designed the packet formats, and additional Exchange-
   Schemes, editing and formatting.  All such mistakes are his responsi-
   bity.

   Use of encryption for privacy protection is also found in the Sta-
   tion-To-Station authentication protocol [DOW92].

   Bart Preneel and Paul C van Oorschot in [PO96] suggested adding
   padding between the data and trailing key when hashing for authenti-
   cation.

   Niels Provos developed the first implementation with multiple schemes
   and multiple moduli per scheme (circa July 1997).
