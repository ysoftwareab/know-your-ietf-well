      RADIUS Extensions for Network-Assisted Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
                    draft-boucadair-mptcp-radius-02

Abstract

   One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
   is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is connected to
   multiple networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the usage of its
   network attachments.  Because of the lack of MPTCP support at the
   server side, some service providers consider a network-assisted model
   that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called: MPTCP
   concentrator.

   This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry the IP addresses that allow
   CPE devices to reach one or multiple MPTCP concentrators.

1.  Introduction

   One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP (MPTCP,
   [RFC6824]) is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is
   connected to multiple networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the
   usage of such resources, see for example [RFC4908].

   Network-assisted MPTCP deployment models are designed to facilitate
   the adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of multi-path
   communications without making any assumption about the support of
   MPTCP by the communicating peers.  This deployment scenario relies on
   MPTCP proxies located on both the CPE and network sides (Figure 1).
   MPTCP proxies are responsible for establishing multi-path
   communications on behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of
   MPTCP capabilities to optimize resource usage to achieve different
   goals that include (but are not limited to) bandwidth aggregation,
   primary/backup communication paths, and traffic offload management.

   Within this document, an MPTCP concentrator (or concentrator) refers
   to a functional element that is responsible for aggregating the
   traffic originated by a group of CPEs.  This element is located in
   the network.  One or multiple concentrators can be deployed in the
   network to assist MPTCP-enabled CPEs to establish MPTCP connections
   via their available network attachments.  On the uplink path, the
   concentrator terminates the MPTCP connections received from its
   customer-facing interfaces and transforms these connections into
   legacy TCP connections [RFC0793] towards upstream servers.  On the
   downlink path, the concentrator turns the legacy server's TCP
   connection into MPTCP connections towards its customer-facing
   interfaces.

   This document specifies two new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS, [RFC2865]) attributes that carry the MPTCP
   concentrator IP address list (Section 2).  In order to accommodate
   both IPv4 and IPv6 deployment contexts, and given the constraints in
   Section 3.4 of [RFC6158], two attributes are specified.  Note that
   one or multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses may be returned to a
   requesting CPE.  A sample use case is described in Section 3.

   This document assumes that the MPTCP concentrator(s) reachability
   information can be stored in Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA) servers while the CPE configuration is usually
   provided by means of DHCP ([RFC2131][RFC3315]).

Internet-Draft              RADIUS for MPTCP                   July 2016


   This specification assumes an MPTCP concentrator is reachable through
   one or multiple IP addresses.  As such, a list of IP addresses can be
   communicated via RADIUS.  Also, it assumes the various network
   attachments provided to an MPTCP-enabled CPE are managed by the same
   administrative entity.

   This document adheres to [I-D.ietf-radext-datatypes] for defining the
   new attributes.

2.  MPTCP RADIUS Attributes

2.1.  MPTCP-IPv4-Concentrator

   Description

      The RADIUS MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 attribute contains the IPv4
      address of an MPTCP concentrator that is assigned to a CPE.

      Because multiple MPTCP concentrator IP addresses may be
      provisioned to an authorised CPE (that is a CPE entitled to
      solicit the resources of a concentrator to establish MPTCP
      connections), multiple instances of the MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4
      attribute MAY be included; each instance of the attribute carries
      a distinct IP address.

      Both MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 and MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6
      attributes MAY be present in a RADIUS message.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS
      Access-Accept packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-
      Request packet as a hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a
      preference, although the server is not required to honor such a
      hint.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 Attribute MAY appear in a CoA-Request
      packet.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS
      Accounting-Request packet.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other
      RADIUS packet.

   Type

      TBA (see Section 6).

   Data Type

      The attribute MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 is of type ip4addr
      (Section 3.3 of [I-D.ietf-radext-datatypes]).

   Value

      This field includes an IPv4 address (32 bits) of the MPTCP
      concentrator.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 attribute MUST NOT include multicast
      and host loopback addresses [RFC6890].  Anycast addresses are
      allowed to be included in an MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 attribute.

2.2.  MPTCP-IPv6-Concentrator

   Description

      The RADIUS MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 attribute contains the IPv6
      address of an MPTCP concentrator that is assigned to a CPE.

      Because multiple MPTCP concentrator IP addresses may be
      provisioned to an authorised CPE (that is a CPE entitled to
      solicit the resources of a concentrator to establish MPTCP
      connections), multiple instances of the MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6
      attribute MAY be included; each instance of the attribute carries
      a distinct IP address.

      Both MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 and MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6
      attributes MAY be present in a RADIUS message.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS
      Access-Accept packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-
      Request packet as a hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a
      preference, although the server is not required to honor such a
      hint.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 Attribute MAY appear in a CoA-Request
      packet.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS
      Accounting-Request packet.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other
      RADIUS packet.

   Length

      18

   Data Type

      The attribute MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 is of type ip6addr
      (Section 3.9 of [I-D.ietf-radext-datatypes]).

   Value

      This field includes an IPv6 address (128 bits) of the MPTCP
      concentrator.

      The MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 attribute MUST NOT include multicast
      and host loopback addresses [RFC6890].  Anycast addresses are
      allowed to be included in an MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 attribute.

3.  Sample Use Case

   This section does not aim to provide an exhaustive list of deployment
   scenarios where the use of the RADIUS MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 and
   MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv4 attributes can be helpful.  Typical
   deployment scenarios are described, for instance, in [RFC6911].

   Figure 2 shows an example where a CPE is assigned an MPTCP
   concentrator.  This example assumes that the Network Access Server
   (NAS) embeds both RADIUS client and DHCPv6 server capabilities.

                     Figure 2: Sample Flow Example (1)

   Upon receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message from a CPE, the NAS sends
   a RADIUS Access-Request message to the AAA server.  Once the AAA
   server receives the request, it replies with an Access-Accept message
   (possibly after having sent a RADIUS Access-Challenge message and
   assuming the CPE is entitled to connect to the network) that carries
   a list of parameters to be used for this session, and which include
   MPTCP concentrator reachability information (namely a list of IP
   addresses).

   The content of the MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 attribute is then used by
   the NAS to complete the DHCPv6 procedure that the CPE initiated to
   retrieve information about the MPTCP concentrator it has been
   assigned.

   Upon change of the MPTCP concentrator assigned to a CPE, the RADIUS
   server sends a RADIUS CoA message [RFC5176] that carries the RADIUS
   MPTCP-Concentrator-IPv6 attribute to the NAS.  Once that message is
   accepted by the NAS, it replies with a RADIUS CoA ACK message.  The
   NAS replaces the old MPTCP concentrator with the new one.

   Figure 3 shows another example where a CPE is assigned an MPTCP
   concentrator, but the CPE uses DHCPv6 to retrieve a list of IP
   addresses of an MPTCP concentrator.

   Some deployments may rely on the mechanisms defined in [RFC4014] or
   [RFC7037], which allows a NAS to pass attributes obtained from a
   RADIUS server to a DHCP server.

4.  Security Considerations

   RADIUS-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC2865].

   MPTCP-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6824] and
   [RFC6181].

   Traffic theft is a risk if an illegitimate concentrator is inserted
   in the path.  Indeed, inserting an illegitimate concentrator in the
   forwarding path allows to intercept traffic and can therefore provide
   access to sensitive data issued by or destined to a host.  To
   mitigate this threat, secure means to discover a concentrator should
   be enabled.

5.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide as what type of RADIUS packets
   that may contain these attributes, and in what quantity.
