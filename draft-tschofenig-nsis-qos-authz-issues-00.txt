Abstract 
    
   Various proposals for NSIS QoS NSLPs have been published recently. 
   The design of a QoS NSLPs has to consider more than only exchanging 
   QoS objects. Authorization has to be handled properly to make this 
   protocol both useful and performant. Authorization in mobile 
   environments, unfortunately, raises additional questions. This 
   document provides an introduction to the topic.

1.    Introduction 
    
   Authorization is a necessary function in order to prevent theft-of-
   service and to enable charging. With regard to authorization a few 
   issues still need to be resolved to specify the protocol interaction 
   for a QoS NSLP with regard to authorization of resource requests.  
    
   [Her95] and [Her96] give some hints about policy handling and 
   authorization in RSVP [RFC2205]. A number of papers have been 
   published in the meanwhile proposing numerous different procedures 
   for handling pricing, charging and even for including micro-payment 
   protocols. None of these proposals, however, plays a role today. To 
   avoid proposing many new alternative ways to handle authorization we 
   would like to draw the attention of the working group to this topic 
   in their effort to create a QoS NSLP. 
    
   With [TB+03] we tried to address the issues of authorization 
   although due to terminology most NSIS working group members have 
   probably not read the draft. Some others even think that these 
   issues are independently of the NSIS NSLP protocol itself.  
    
   We think that the following questions should be addressed during the 
   work on a QoS NSLP: 
    
   a) Which entities are involved in computing the authorization 
      decision?  
    
   b) How long is the authorization decision valid?  
    
   c) What information is needed to compute the authorization decision?  
    
   We will provide more details to these questions in the subsequent 
   sections.

   It should be noted that the result of the authorization process 
   might be a "yes" or "no" decision or even a complex policy. In some 
   cases the latter might allow to answer further authorization 
   requests locally.  
    
2.    Terminology 
    
   This draft uses terminology described in [TB+03].  
    
3.    Which entities are involved in computing the authorization decision? 
    
   At an abstract level we have two different cases with regard to NSIS 
   signaling: 
                             
         +-------------+  QoS request     +--------------+ 
         |  Entity     |----------------->| Entity       | 
         |  requesting |                  | authorizing  | 
         |  resource   |granted / rejected| resource     | 
         |             |<-----------------| request      | 
         +-------------+                  +--------------+ 
                   ^                           ^ 
                   +...........................+ 
                      financial establishment 
    
                       Figure 1: Two party approach 
    
   Figure 1 describes the simple and basic approach where  
   (a) the authorization decision is purely executed between the two 
       entities only or 
   (b) where previous (out-of-band) mechanisms separated the signaling 
       protocol from executing other entities during NSIS protocol 
       execution.  
    
   The entity authorizing the resource request and the entity actually 
   performing the QoS reservation are in the same administrative 
   domain. Hence they are treated as a single logical entity.  
    
   Examples for this type of model can be found between two neighboring 
   networks (inter-domain signaling) where a long-term contract (or 
   other out-of-band mechanisms) exists and allows both networks to 
   know 
    
   - how much a resource reservation costs 
    
   - how to charge the other entity (i.e. how the authorizing entity 
     finally gets paid for the consumed resources) and  
    
   - how to authorize the resource requesting entity (i.e. associating 
     the identifier of the protected signaling message to the identity 
 
 
Tschofenig et al.      Expires - December 2003               [Page 3] 
                    QoS NSLP Authorization Issues           June 2003 
 
 
     used in the authentication and key exchange protocol run and 
     finally this identity to the user identity of the contract for the 
     purpose of charging).  
     
    
   The consequence for an NSIS QoS NSLP protocol in this case is:  
   - No additional message signaling for authorization is required  
    
   - It might be necessary to include only some new objects.  
    
   - Triggering other protocols (such as credit control) might be 
     necessary but has no impact on the NSIS signaling machinery 
    
   It might also be possible to count micro-payment protocol approaches 
   to the two party case since it is a pure two party protocol. Fully 
   integrating a payment protocol into NSIS, however, requires 
   modifications to the NSIS protocol machinery itself since the 
   message flows of NSIS and the message flows of the payment protocol 
   might not be compatible.  
    
   Next a three party approach is presented which has two facets 
   whereby the first variant is shown in Figure 2 and the alternative 
   approach in Figure 3: 
    
                                     +--------------+ 
                                     | Entity       | 
                                     | authorizing  | <...+ 
                                     | resource     |     . 
                                     | request      |     . 
                                     +-----------+--+     . 
                                        ^        |        .

                                    req.|        | res.   . 
                                        |        |        . 
                       QoS              |        v        . 
    +-------------+    request       +--+-----------+     . 
    |  Entity     |----------------->| Entity       |     . 
    |  requesting |                  | performing   |     . 
    |  resource   |granted / rejected| QoS          |  <..+ 
    |             |<-----------------| reservation  | financial 
    +-------------+                  +--------------+ settlement 
    
                      Figure 2: Three party approach 
    
   The three party approach is considerably more complex since an NSIS 
   protocol has to enable the corresponding mechanisms to contact a 
   third party which executes the authorization request and (if 
 
 
Tschofenig et al.      Expires - December 2003               [Page 4]

   successful) establishes a financial settlement to the entity 
   providing the QoS reservation. The requesting entity is involved in 
   this three party approach since it has to authenticate itself to the 
   entity authorizing the request.  
    
   This type of configuration is common in mobility environments with 
   per-session authorization. Section 6 gives an example of per-session 
   authorization (per-session or even more often). Thereby a resource 
   request by the end host is send to an RSVP node in the local network 
   and then forwarded to the local PDP (via COPS). Since the local 
   domain is unable to verify the request it has to be forwarded to the 
   user's home network where authorization is provided. The response is 
   then returned and resources are granted (in case of a successful 
   authorization decision). The interaction between the visited network 
   and the home network establishes the necessary financial 
   infrastructure to latter charge the user for the consumed resources.

        Token Request   +--------------+

                Figure 3: Token based Three party approach  
    
   The token based three party approach is applicable in environments 
   where a previous protocol interaction is used to request 
   authorization tokens (or something similar) to assist the 
   authorization process at the entity performing the QoS reservation. 
   This approach can be found in solutions where OSP Tokens [OSP] are 
   or Authorization Tokens as used as described in [RFC3520] and in 
   [RFC3521].  
    
   Additionally to consider are the following questions: 
 
 
Tschofenig et al.      Expires - December 2003               [Page 5] 
                    QoS NSLP Authorization Issues           June 2003 
 
 
    
   - A resource request might be necessary between neighboring entities 
   only or between non-neighboring entities. 
    
   - Additionally of interest is whether authorization should be 
   provided to more than one entity along the path.  
    
   Both issues refer to the difference between the New Jersey Turnpike 
   and the New Jersey Parkway Model. See [TB+03] for a description of 
   the different trust models. Furthermore Section 6 of [TB+03] is of 
   interest when it comes to the question whether the sender or the 
   receiver should authorize a QoS request.  
    
4.    How long is the authorization decision valid? 
    
   For the NSIS QoS NSLP protocol machinery it is important to consider 
   at what frequency authorization decisions are made. Some possible 
   options are:  
    
   - Per request  
     (e.g. a request for more QoS resources than previously requested) 
    
   - Per session  
     (e.g. only during the initial setup of a QoS resource) 
    
   - Periodically  
     (authorization decision is repeated after a certain time interval) 
    
   - Event triggered  
     (as soon as something changes e.g. price changes due to mobility 
     which requires reauthorization) 
    
   The concept of a per-channel authorization (and financial 
   establishment) is introduced in [TB+03] and tries to move a three 
   party to a two party scenario by establishing the necessary 
   infrastructure outside NSIS and to thereby make it simpler. Thereby 
   it is possible to authorize QoS resource requests locally. The 
   feasibly of this approach heavily depends on assumptions.  
    
   If authorization is, however, provided based on the three party 
   approach then for example a periodically triggered re-authorization 
   request requires that the third party is contacted with every 
   authorization request. This might place a considerable burden onto 
   the QoS signaling protocol in a mobile environment.  
 
5.    What information is needed to compute the authorization decision?  
    
   Whenever an authorization decision has to be made then there is the 
   question which information serves as an input to the authorizing 
 
 
Tschofenig et al.      Expires - December 2003               [Page 6] 
                    QoS NSLP Authorization Issues           June 2003 
 
 
   entity. The following information items have been mentioned in the 
   past for computing the authorization decision (in addition to the 
   authenticated identity): 
    
   - Price 
    
   - QoS objects 
    
   - Policy rules  
    
   Policy rules include attributes like time of day, subscription to 
   certain services, membership, etc. into consideration when computing 
   an authorization decision.  
    
   Some of these information items are only available at certain 
   places. By, for example, relying on policy rules it is likely that 
   an authorization decision has to be made in the user's home network 
   since the network administrator might not be willing to disclose the 
   policies to other networks in order to offload the authorization 
   decision. 
    
   In case of QoS objects it might be fairly difficult for an 
   authorizing entity to grant a QoS authorization request since the 
   objects by themselves might not always allow inferring to the price 
   of the reservation. Hence in most cases it might be desirable to 
   provide additionally some price information (if not agreed between 
   the networks in advance).  
    
6.    Authorization example based on RSVP 
    
   This section illustrates a simple message flow based on the features 
   offered by RSVP. We assume a mobile environment where an end host is 
   attached to a network which is not his own home network. We do not 
   distinguish the case where the user has no home network and where 
   alternative means of access are used to authorize network access and 
   other resources. A short description of the two principal network 
   access authentication scenarios can be found in [Tsc03]. They are 
   also applicable for this discussion.  
    
   The description in [RFC3182], in [Her95] and in [Her96] gave us the 
   impression that RSVP aims to target authorization on the basis of an 
   individual RSVP message. Furthermore it seems that the New Jersey 
   Turnpike Model is the favorite model (although not directly 
   mentioned).  
    
   Figure 4 shows a typically message flow whereby the end host starts 
   with network access authentication before address configuration 
   occurs. Subsequently QoS signaling with RSVP starts with a PATH 
   message. The RSVP PATH message contains a Policy Object with a

   [RFC3182].

      Figure 4: RSVP Signaling Message Exchange with PDP Interaction 
    
   In [Tho02] it is suggested to delegate the authorization decision to 
   the local PDP and subsequently to the user's home PDP. This seems to 
   be necessary if an authorization decision has to be provided for 
   each individual session or even for each individual RSVP signaling 
   message. Verification of the digital signature might not help with 
   authorization in most environments.  
    
   The digital signature allows authentication of the client to the PDP 
   at the home network. Mutual authentication is not offered and replay 
   protection is most likely based on timestamps (although not 
   mentioned in [RFC3182]). In addition to the Policy Object it is also 
   necessary to forward information about the requested resources 
   otherwise an authorization decision by the user's home PDP is 
   worthless. Even then it is difficult for the PDP in the user's home 
   network to perform an authorization decision since the costs of the 
   reservation are most likely not known at this time. Since the 
   duration of the QoS reservation during reservation setup, the

   authorization request/response scheme would have to be repeated 
   periodically. In this sender-authorizing scheme it is difficult to 
   determine how much resources will be actually reserved due to the 
   nature of the RSVP PATH message with its ADSPEC object and the 
   ability of the receiver to change the QoS reservation.  
    
   Public key based authentication between the user and his home 
   network would typically be used because   
    
   (a) user identity confidentiality is desired or  
    
   (b) if the user authenticates itself to the local network (and not 
       to the home network)  
    
   Since the public key based authentication proposed in [RFC3182] does 
   not provide (a) and scenarios for (b) do not require client based 
   public key based authentication it seems to be difficult to find a 
   motivation for using a performance intensive mechanism without an 
   additional benefit.  
    
   Clients today use a number of different authentication protocols 
   such as SRP, UTMS-AKA, etc. which offer different cryptographic 
   properties. In a mobile environment RSVP, together with COPS, 
   simulates functionality known from Radius and Diameter. It seems to 
   be unlikely that network operations add COPS for inter-domain 
   signaling only although Radius and Diameter already offers the same 
   functionality.  
    
   [RFC3182] also offers authentication based on a shared secret. For 
   entity authentication between the end host and the user's home 
   network this seems to be the most efficient approach although the 
   sequence number handling might not be the best replay protection 
   approach.  
    
   As with pk-based authentication and authentication based on 
   symmetric keys, Kerberos authentication to the PDP in the user's 
   home network does not provide session key distribution to the first 
   RSVP node in the visited network. To protect signaling messages a 
   session key for the RSVP Integrity object should be available. From 
   a performance point of view it is highly recommended to execute this 
   cross-realm authentication procedure only as frequently as 
   absolutely necessary due the high overhead. If Kerberos should be 
   additionally used to authenticate the user to the first RSVP node 
   then additional problems occur. Kerberos cross-realm authentication 
   does not match to AAA inter-domain handling. Several roundtrips 
   might be required to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket of the 
   visited domain and finally the service ticket for either the PDP or 
   the first policy aware RSVP router.

   In case of the New Jersey Turnpike Model authorization is only 
   provided between neighboring entities. For signaling messages which 
   are exchanged between neighboring domains it is not necessary to 
   perform per-session authorization by including a Policy Object. 
   Since the neighboring domains have long-term contracts and security 
   associations can easily be established data origin authentication is 
   provided by the RSVP Integrity Object. The identifier used to select 
   the key for the Integrity object can be associated with the identity 
   which allows authorizing the QoS request. Hence we argue that the 
   Policy Object should not be used for entity authentication between 
   neighboring networks due to the performance restrictions and the 
   presence of the RSVP Integrity object.  
    
   It should be noted that the policy control and the admission control 
   procedure perform different functions although they use similar 
   information. Both procedures might require information about the 
   requested resources (i.e. QoS objects). The admission control 
   procedure does not need to use user identity information or other 
   complex policy rules for deciding whether to grant a request or not. 
   The two entities executing the policy control and the admission 
   control procedure do not need to be co-located or even in the same 
   network. In the mobile scenario case it seems that admission control 
   is executed at the local network whereas policy control is provided 
   at the user's home network as part of the authorization procedure. 
   Most important for determining an authorization decision at the 
   user's home network is most likely a monetary amount - and not a QoS 
   object. In some cases it might be, however, possible for the PDP in 
   the user's home network to associate the cost of a QoS reservation 
   with the provided IntServ parameter.  
    
7.    Security Considerations 
    
   This document address authorization for QoS NSLPs and tries to raise 
   some questions about the expected functionality of this specific 
   application signaling protocol.  
    
   A definition of authorization in the QoS environment should be 
   created as part of a working group discussion to allow an NSLP 
   protocol to address the corresponding security requirements.  
    
8.    Acknowledgments 
    
   We would like to thank Allison Mankin for their comments to the NSIS 
   AAA draft. Her comments gave us the impression that we should work 
   on a shorter draft which raises the most important open issues.
