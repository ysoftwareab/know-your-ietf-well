       Message Authentication Code for the Network Time Protocol
                         draft-ietf-ntp-mac-06

Abstract

   RFC 5905 states that Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets should be
   authenticated by appending the NTP data to a 128-bit key, and hashing
   the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.  This document
   deprecates MD5-based authentication, which is considered to be too
   weak, and recommends the use of AES-CMAC as in RFC 4493 as a
   replacement.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] states that Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets
   should be authenticated by appending the NTP data to a 128-bit key,
   and hashing the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.  This
   document deprecates MD5-based authentication, which is considered to
   be too weak, and recommends the use of AES-CMAC [RFC4493] as a
   replacement.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Deprecating the use of MD5

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] defines how the MD5 digest algorithm in RFC 1321
   [RFC1321] can be used as a message authentication code (MAC) for
   authenticating NTP packets.  However, as discussed in [BCK] and RFC
   6151 [RFC6151], this is not a secure MAC and therefore MUST be
   deprecated.

3.  Replacement Recommendation

   If NTP authentication is implemented, then AES-CMAC as specified in
   RFC 4493 [RFC4493] MUST be computed over all fields in the NTP
   header, and any extension fields that are present in the NTP packet
   as described in RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  The MAC key for NTP MUST be 128
   bits long AES-128 key and the resulting MAC tag MUST be at least 128
   bits long as stated in section 2.4 of RFC 4493 [RFC4493].  NTP makes
   this transition possible as it supports algorithm agility as
   described in Section 2.1 of RFC 7696 [RFC7696].

   The hosts who wish to use NTP authentication share a symmetric key
   out-of-band.  So they MUST implement AES-CMAC and share the
   corresponding symmetric key.  A symmetric key is a triplet of ID,
   type (e.g.  MD5, AES-CMAC) and the key itself.  All three have to
   match in order to succesfully authenticate packets between two hosts.
   Old implementations that don't support AES-CMAC will not accept and
   will not send packets authenticated with such a key.

4.  Motivation

   AES-CMAC is recommended for the following reasons:

   1.  It is an IETF standard that is available in many open source
       implementations.

   2.  It is immune to nonce-reuse vulnerabilities (e.g.  [Joux])
       because it does not use a nonce.

   3.  It has fine performance in terms of latency and throughput.

   4.  It benefits from native hardware support, for instance, Intel's
       New Instruction set GUE [GUE].

5.  Test Vectors

   For test vectors and their outputs refer to Section 4 of RFC 4493
   [RFC4493]

6.  Security Considerations

   Refer to the Appendices A, B and C of NIST document on recommendation
   for the CMAC mode of authentication [NIST] and Security
   Considerations Section of RFC 4493 [RFC4493] for discussion on
   security guarantees of AES-CMAC.
