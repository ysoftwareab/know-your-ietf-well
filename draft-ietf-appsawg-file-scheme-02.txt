Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


1.  Introduction

   A file URI identifies a file on a particular file system.  It can be
   used in discussions about the file, and if other conditions are met
   it can be dereferenced to directly access the file.

   The file URI scheme is not coupled with a specific protocol.  As
   such, there is no well-defined set of operations that can be
   performed on file URIs, nor a specific media type associated with
   them.

   This document defines a syntax that is compatible with most extant
   implementations, while attempting to push towards a stricter subset
   of "ideal" constructs.  In many cases it simultaneously acknowledges
   and deprecates some less common or outdated constructs.

1.1.  History

   The file URI scheme was first defined in [RFC1630], which, being an
   informational RFC, does not specify an Internet standard.  The
   definition was standardised in [RFC1738], and the scheme was
   registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA);
   however that definition omitted certain language included by former
   that clarified aspects such as:

   o  the use of slashes to denote boundaries between directory levels
      of a hierarchical file system; and

   o  the requirement that client software convert the file URI into a
      file name in the local file name conventions.

   The Internet draft [I-D.hoffman-file-uri] was written in an effort to
   keep the file URI scheme on standards track when [RFC1738] was made
   obsolete, but that draft expired in 2005.  It enumerated concerns
   arising from the various, often conflicting implementations of the
   scheme.  It serves as the spiritual predecessor of this document.

   Additionally the WHATWG defines a living URL standard [WHATWG-URL],
   which includes algorithms for interpreting file URIs (as URLs).

1.2.  Similar Technologies

   The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) [MS-DTYP] defines a string
   format that can perform a similar role to the file URI scheme in
   describing the location of files.  A UNC filespace selector string
   has three parts: host, share, and path; see: Appendix E.  This
   document describes a means of translating between UNC filespace
   selector strings and file URIs.

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document the term "local" is used to describe files
   that can be accessed directly through the local file system.  It is
   important to note that a local file may not be physically located on
   the local machine, for example if a networked file system is
   transparently mounted into the local file system.

2.  Syntax

   The file URI syntax is defined here in Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234], including the core ABNF syntax rule "ALPHA" defined
   by that specification, and importing the "userinfo", "host",
   "authority" and "path-absolute" rules from [RFC3986] (as updated by
   [RFC6874].)

   Please note Appendix C that lists some other commonly seen but
   nonstandard variations.

      file-URI       = file-scheme ":" file-hier-part

      file-scheme    = "file"

      file-hier-part = "//" auth-path
                     / local-path

      auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute

      local-path     = path-absolute

      file-auth      = [ userinfo "@" ] host

   The syntax definition above is different from those given in
   [RFC1630] and [RFC1738] as it is derived from the generic syntax of
   [RFC3986], which post-dates all previous specifications.

   Systems exhibit different levels of case-sensitivity.  Unless the
   file system is known to be case-insensitive, implementations MUST
   maintain the case of file and directory names when translating file
   URIs to and from the local system's representation of file paths, and
   any systems or devices that transport file URIs MUST NOT alter the
   case of file URIs they transport.

3.  Operations on file URIs

   Implementations SHOULD, at a minimum, provide a read-like operation
   to return the contents of a file located by a file URI.  Additional
   operations MAY be provided, such as writing, creating, and deleting
   files.  See the POSIX file and directory operations [POSIX] for
   examples of standardized operations that can be performed on files.

   File URIs can also be translated to and from local file paths or UNC
   strings.

   A file URI can only be translated to a local file path if it has a
   blank or no authority.  Note that this differs from the previous
   specification in [RFC1738], in that previously an authority of
   "localhost" was used to refer to the local file system, but in this
   specification it equates to a UNC string with the host "localhost".

   This specification neither defines nor forbids a mechanism for
   accessing non-local files.  See SMB [MS-SMB], NFS [RFC3530], NCP
   [NOVELL] for examples of protocols that can be used to access files
   over a network.

3.1.  Translating Local File Path to file URI

   Below is an algorithmic description of the process used to convert a
   file path to an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)
   [RFC3987], which can then be translated to a URI as per Section 3.1
   of [RFC3987]; see: Section 4.

   1.  Resolve the file path to its fully qualified absolute form.

   2.  Initialise the URI with the "file:" scheme identifier.

   3.  If including an empty authority field, append the "//" sigil to
       the URI.

   4.  Append a slash character "/" to the URI, to signify the path
       root.

   5.  For each directory in the path after the root:

       1.  Transform the directory name to a path segment ([RFC3986],
           Section 3.3) as per Section 2 of [RFC3986].

       2.  Append the transformed segment and a delimiting slash
           character "/" to the URI.

   6.  If the path includes a file name:

Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


       1.  Transform the file name to a path segment as above.

       2.  Append the transformed segment to the URI.

   Differences from RFC 1738

   In [RFC1738] a file URL always started with the token "file://",
   followed by an authority and a "/".  That "/" was not considered part
   of the path.  This implies that the correct encoding for a file path
   in a UNIX-like environment would have been:

        token     + authority + slash + path
      = "file://" + ""        + "/"   + "/path/to/file.txt"
      = "file:////path/to/file.txt"

   However that construct was never used in practice, and in fact would
   have collided with the eventual encoding of UNC strings in URIs
   described in Appendix C.2.

3.2.  Translating UNC String to file URI

   A UNC filespace selector string can be directly translated to an
   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [RFC3987], which can then
   be translated to a URI as per Section 3.1 of [RFC3987]; see:
   Section 4.

   1.  Initialise the URI with the "file:" scheme identifier.

   2.  Append the authority:

       1.  Append the "//" authority sigil to the URI.

       2.  Append the hostname field of the UNC string to the URI.

   3.  Append the sharename:

       1.  Transform the sharename to a path segment ([RFC3986],
           Section 3.3) as per Section 2 of [RFC3986].

       2.  Append a delimiting slash character "/" and the transformed
           segment to the URI.

   4.  For each objectname:

       1.  Transform the objectname to a path segment ([RFC3986],
           Section 3.3) as per Section 2 of [RFC3986].

Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


       2.  Append a delimiting slash character "/" and the transformed
           segment to the URI.

   Example:

      UNC String:   \\host.example.com\Share\path\to\file.txt
      URI:          file://host.example.com/Share/path/to/file.txt

   Differences from RFC 1738

   In [RFC1738] a file URL an authority of "localhost" was used to refer
   to the local file system, but in this specification it equates to a
   UNC string with the host "localhost".

3.3.  Translating Non-local File Path to file URI

   Translating a non-local file path other than a UNC string to a file
   URI follows the same basic algorithm as for local files, above,
   except that the authority MUST refer to the network-accesible node
   that hosts the file.

   For example, in a clustered OpenVMS Files-11 system the authority
   would contain the node name.  Where the original node reference
   includes a username and password in an access control string, they
   MAY be transcribed into the userinfo field of the authority
   ([RFC3986], Section 3.2.1), security considerations (Section 5)
   notwithstanding.

3.4.  Incompatible File Paths

   Some conventional file path formats are known to be incompatible with
   the file URI scheme.

3.4.1.  Win32 Namespaces

   The Microsoft Windows API defines Win32 Namespaces [Win32-Namespaces]
   for interacting with files and devices using Windows API functions.
   These namespaced paths are prefixed by "\\?\" for Win32 File
   Namespaces and "\\.\" for Win32 Device Namespaces.  There is also a
   special case for UNC file paths in Win32 File Namespaces, referred to
   as "Long UNC", using the prefix "\\?\UNC\".

   This specification does not define a mechanism for translating
   namespaced paths to or from file URIs.

Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


4.  Encoding

   The encoding of a file URI depends on the file system.  If the file
   system uses a known non-Unicode character encoding, the path SHOULD
   be converted to a sequence of characters from the Universal Character
   Set [ISO10646] normalized according to Normalization Form C (NFC)
   [UTR15], before being translated to a file URI, and conversely a file
   URI SHOULD be converted back to the file system's native encoding
   when translating to a file path.

      Note that many modern file systems encode directory and file names
      as arbitrary sequences of octets.  In those cases, the
      representation as an encoded string often depends on the user's
      localization settings, or defaults to UTF-8 [STD63].

   When the file system's encoding is not known the file URI SHOULD be
   transported as an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)
   [RFC3987] to avoid ambiguity.  See Appendix D for examples.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [RFC3986].

   File access and the granting of privileges for specific operations
   are complex topics, and the use of file URIs can complicate the
   security model in effect for file privileges.  Software using file
   URIs MUST NOT grant greater access than would be available for other
   file access methods.

   File systems typically assign an operational meaning to special
   characters, such as the "/", "\", ":", "[", and "]" characters, and
   to special device names like ".", "..", "...", "aux", "lpt", etc.  In
   some cases, merely testing for the existence of such a name will
   cause the operating system to pause or invoke unrelated system calls,
   leading to significant security concerns regarding denial of service
   and unintended data transfer.  It would be impossible for this
   specification to list all such significant characters and device
   names.  Implementers MUST research the reserved names and characters
   for the types of storage device that may be attached to their
   application and restrict the use of data obtained from URI components
   accordingly.

   Additionally, as discussed in the HP OpenVMS Systems Documentation
   http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/84final/ba554_90015/ch03s09.html
   "access control strings include sufficient information to allow
   someone to break in to the remote account, [therefore] they create
   serious security exposure."  In a similar vein, the presence of a

   password in a "user:password" userinfo field is deprecated by
   [RFC3986].  As such, the userinfo field of a file URI, if present,
   MUST NOT contain a password.

Appendix A.  Example URIs

   The syntax in Section 2 is intended to support file URIs that take
   the following forms:

   Local files:

   o  "file:///path/to/file"

         A traditional file URI for a local file, with an empty
         authority.  This is the most common format in use today.

   o  "file:/path/to/file"

         The minimal representation of a local file, with no authority
         field and an absolute path that begins with a slash "/".

   Non-local files:

   o  "file://host.example.com/path/to/file"

         The representation of a non-local file, with an explicit
         authority.  Note that, unlike in [RFC1738], the string
         "localhost" in the authority signifies a non-local file.

Appendix B.  System-specific Operations

   This section provides examples of some system-specific thingies.

   This section is not normative.  [FIXME: it's also incomplete]

B.1.  POSIX Systems

   o  No special considerations (file URIs are based on UNIX paths)

B.2.  DOS- and Windows-Like Systems

   When mapping a DOS- or Windows-like file path to a URI, use the drive
   letter (e.g. "c:") as the first path segment.

   Some implementations leave the leading slash off before the drive
   letter.  See Appendix C.1)

   Some implementations replace ":" with "|", while others leave it off
   completely.  See Appendix C.1.2

Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


B.3.  Mac OS X Systems

   o  HFS+ uses non-standard UTF-8 [STD63] form (like NFD)

      *  take care transforming <-> NFC [UTR15]

B.4.  OpenVMS Files-11 Systems

   When mapping a VMS file path to a file URI, use the device name as
   the first path segment.  Note that the dollars sign "$" is a reserved
   character ([RFC3986], Section 2.2), so should be percent-encoded.

   If the VMS file path includes a node reference, use that as the
   authority.  Where the original node reference includes a username and
   password in an access control string, they can be transcribed into
   the userinfo field of the authority ([RFC3986], Section 3.2.1),
   security considerations (Section 5) notwithstanding.

Appendix C.  Nonstandard Syntax Variations

   These variations may be encountered for historical reasons, but are
   not supported by the normative syntax of Section 2.

   This section is not normative.

C.1.  DOS and Windows Drive Letters

   On Windows- or DOS-based file systems a absolute file path can begin
   with a drive letter.  To facilitate this, the "local-path" rule in
   Section 2 can be replaced with the following:

      local-path     = [ drive-letter ] path-absolute

      drive-letter   = ALPHA ":"

   This is intended to support URIs of the form:

   o  "file:c:/path/to/file"

         The minimal representation of a local file in a DOS- or
         Windows-based environment, with no authority field and an
         absolute path that begins with a drive letter.

   Note that comparison of drive letters in DOS or Windows file paths is
   case-insensitive.  Some implementations therefore canonicalize drive
   letters in file URIs by converting them to uppercase.

Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


C.1.1.  Relative Paths

   In DOS- or Windows-based file systems, relative paths beginning with
   a slash "/" should be resolved relative to the drive letter, and
   resolution of ".." dot segments (per Section 5.2.4 of [RFC3986])
   should not ever overwrite the drive letter.

   e.g.:

      base:       file:///c:/path/to/file.txt
      rel. URI:   /some/other/thing.bmp
      resolved:   file:///c:/some/other/thing.bmp

      base:       file:///c:/foo.txt
      rel. URI:   ../../bar.txt
      resolved:   file:///c:/bar.txt

   Relative paths with a drive letter followed by a character other than
   a slash (e.g. "c:bar/baz.txt" or "c:../foo.txt") should not be
   accepted as valid URIs in DOS or Windows systems.

C.1.2.  Vertical Bar Character

   Historically some implementations have used a vertical line character
   "|" instead of a colon ":" in the drive letter construct.  [RFC3986]
   forbids the use of the vertical line, however it may be necessary to
   interpret or update old URIs.

   For interpreting such URIs, the "auth-path" and "local-path" rules in
   Section 2 and the "drive-letter" rule above are replaced with the
   following:

      auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute
                     / [ file-auth ] file-absolute

      local-path     = [ drive-letter ] path-absolute
                     / file-absolute

      file-absolute  = "/" drive-letter path-absolute

      drive-letter   = ALPHA ":"
                     / ALPHA "|"

   This is intended to support URIs of the form:

   o  "file:///c|/path/to/file"

   o  "file:/c|/path/to/file"

Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


   o  "file:c|/path/to/file"

         Regular DOS or Windows file URIs, with vertical line characters
         in the drive letter construct.

   To update such an old URI, replace the vertical line "|" with a colon
   ":".

C.2.  UNC Paths

   It is common to encounter file URIs that encode entire UNC strings in
   the path, with all backslash "\" characters replaced with slashes
   "/".

   To interpret such URIs, the "auth-path" rule in Section 2 is replaced
   with the following:

      auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute
                     / unc-authority path-absolute

      unc-authority  = 2*3"/" [ userinfo "@" ] file-host

      file-host      = inline-IP / IPv4address / reg-name

      inline-IP      = "%5B" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture ) "%5D"

   This syntax uses the "userinfo", "IPv4address, "IPv6address",
   "IPvFuture", and "reg-name` rules from [RFC3986].

      Note that the "file-host" rule is the same as "host" but with
      percent-encoding applied to "[" and "]" characters.

   This extended syntax is intended to support URIs that take the
   following forms, in addition to those in Appendix A:

   Non-local files:

   o  "file:////host.example.com/path/to/file"

         The "traditional" representation of a non-local file, with an
         empty authority and a complete (transformed) UNC string in the
         path.

   o  "file://///host.example.com/path/to/file"

         As above, with an extra slash between the empty authority and
         the transformed UNC string, conformant with the definition from

Internet-Draft                 file-scheme                      May 2015


         [RFC1738].  This representation is notably used by the Firefox
         web browser.  See Bugzilla#107540 [Bug107540].

   It also further limits the set of file URIs that can be translated to
   a local file path to those with a path that does not encode a UNC
   string.

C.3.  Backslash as Separator

   Historically some implementations have copied entire file paths into
   the path components of file URIs.  Where DOS or Windows file paths
   were copied thus, resulting URI strings contained unencoded backslash
   "\" characters, which are forbidden by both [RFC1738] and [RFC3986].

   It may be possible to translate or update such an invalid file URI by
   replacing all backslashes "\" with slashes "/", if it can be
   determined with reasonable certainty that the backslashes are
   intended as path separators.

Appendix D.  Example of IRI vs Percent-Encoded URI

   The following examples demonstrate the advantage of encoding file
   URIs as IRIs to avoid ambiguity (see Section 4).

   Example: file IRI:

   | Bytes of file IRI in a UTF-8 document:
   |    66 69 6c 65 3a 43 3a 2f 72 65 c3 a7 75 2e 74 78 74
   |    f  i  l  e  :  c  :  /  r  e  ( c ) u  .  t  x  t
   |
   | Interpretation:
   |    A file named "recu.txt" with a cedilla on the "c", in the
   |    directory "C:\" of a DOS or Windows file system.
   |
   | Character value sequences of file paths, for various file system
   | encodings:
   |
   |  o UTF-16 (e.g. NTFS):
   |       0043 003a 005c 0072 0065 00e7 0075 002e 0074 0078 0074
   |
   |  o Codepage 437 (e.g. MS-DOS):
   |       43   3a   5c   72   65   87   75   2e   74   78   74

   | Percent-encoded file URI, in any ASCII-compatible document:
   |    "file:///%E3%81%A1"
   |
   | Possible interpretations of the file name, depending on the
   | (unknown) encoding of the file system:
   |
   |  o UTF-8:
   |       <HIRAGANA LETTER TI (U+3061)>
   |
   |  o Codepage 437:
   |       <GREEK SMALL LETTER PI (U+03C0)> +
   |       <LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS (U+00FC)> +
   |       <LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE (U+00ED)>
   |
   |  o EBCDIC:
   |       "Ta~"
   |
   | etc.

Appendix E.  UNC Syntax

   The UNC filespace selector string is a null-terminated sequence of
   characters from the Universal Character Set [ISO10646].

   The syntax of a UNC filespace selector string, as defined by
   [MS-DTYP], is given here in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] for convenience.  Note that this definition is informative
   only; the normative description is in [MS-DTYP].

      UNC = "\\" hostname "\" sharename *( "\" objectname )
      hostname   = netbios-name / fqdn / ip-address
      sharename  = <name of share or resource to be accessed>
      objectname = <depends on resource being accessed>

   o  "netbios-name" from [MS-NBTE], Section 2.2.1.

   o  "fqdn" from [RFC1035] or [RFC1123]

   o  "ip-address" from Section 2.1 of [RFC1123], or Section 2.2 of
      [RFC4291].

   The precise format of "sharename" depends on the protocol; see: SMB
   [MS-SMB], NFS [RFC3530], NCP [NOVELL].

Appendix F.  Collected Rules

   Here are the collected syntax rules for all optional appendices,
   presented for convenience.

      file-URI       = file-scheme ":" file-hier-part

      file-scheme    = "file"

      file-hier-part = "//" auth-path
                     / local-path

      auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute
                     / [ file-auth ] file-absolute
                     / unc-authority path-absolute

      local-path     = [ drive-letter ] path-absolute
                     / file-absolute

      file-auth      = [ userinfo "@" ] host

      unc-authority  = 2*3"/" [ userinfo "@" ] file-host

      file-host      = inline-IP / IPv4address / reg-name

      inline-IP      = "%5B" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture ) "%5D"

      file-absolute  = "/" drive-letter path-absolute

      drive-letter   = ALPHA ":"
                     / ALPHA "|"

   This collected syntax is intended to support file URIs that take the
   following forms:

   Local files:

   o  "file:///path/to/file"

         A traditional file URI for a local file, with an empty
