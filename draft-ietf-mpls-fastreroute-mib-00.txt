               3. Introduction 
                   
                  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
                  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
                  In particular, it describes managed objects for Multiprotocol Label 
                  Switching (MPLS) based fast rerouting. This MIB should be used in 
                  conjunction with [3] and [4]. 
                   
               4. Brief Description of MIB Objects. 
                   
                  The objects described in this section support the detour 
                  functionality described in Section 3 of [5]. Bypass tunnels are for 
                  further study. 
                
               4.1. mplsFrrConstTable 
                   
                  This table contains fast-reroute constraints such as setup and 
                  holding priorities and bandwidth for a tunnel instance to be 
                  protected by using detour LSPs. 
                   
                  This table is used at the ingress node of the protected tunnel 
                  instance to configure detour LSP setup constraints. 
                
               4.2. mplsFrrPLRTable 
                
                  The mplsFrrPLRTable is an optional table that contains lists of PLRs 
                  that initiated detour LSPs to protect tunnel instances. 
                   
                  When detour LSPs initiated by different PLRs to protect the same 
                  tunnel instance, are merged together before entering an LSR then at 
                  this LSR, entries of those PLRs point to the same detour LSP entry 
                  in the mplsFrrDetourTable. 
                   
               4.3. mplsFrrDetourTable 
                   
                  The mplsFrrDetourTable shows the detour LSPs in each node (ingress, 
                  transit and egress LSRs). An entry of this table represents a detour 
                  LSP. Each detour is identified by: 
                  - tunnel index (which is set to the tunnel-id of the LSP protected 
                     by this detour), 
                  - tunnel instance (which is set to the LSP-id of the LSP protected 
                     by this detour), 
                  - ingress node (which is set to the ingress node of the LSP 
                     protected by this detour), 
                  - egress node (which is set to the egress node of the LSP protected 
                     by this detour), and 
                  - detour index. 
                  Multiple detours of the same protected LSP may go through the same 
                  node. In this case, the first four identifiers are not sufficient to 
                  uniquely identify each detour LSP. Therefore, an additional detour 
                  index is introduced. 
                   
                 
               Cetin, et. al.                                                [Page 2] 
                               draft-ietf-mpls-fastreroute-mib-00.txt   December 2002 
                
                
                  Each entry describes the properties of the detour LSP like 
                  bandwidth, setup and holding priority,... and also whether or not 
                  the detour LSP is merged with another detour LSP or with the 
                  protected LSP. 
                   
                  mplsFrrDetourTable does not define the in and out segments forming 
                  the detour. Instead, these are defined by creating rows in the in-
                  segment and out-segment tables, defining relationships in the cross-
                  connect table and referring to these rows in the mplsFrrDetourTable 
                  using a cross-connect row pointer (mplsFrrDetourXCPointer). These 
                  segment and cross-connect related objects are defined in [4].  
                   
                  When detour LSPs are merged, then for each individual detour LSP, an 
                  entry is created in this table. Each such detour LSP points to a 
                  different cross-connect entry. These cross-connect entries have the 
                  same mplsXCIndex and mplsOutSegmentIndex. mplsOutSegmentIndex will 
                  point to the entry of the out segment table created for the final 
                  detour LSP selected as a result of the merging rules. This final 
                  detour LSP is given by mplsFrrDetourMergedDetourIndex object in each 
                  entry of the merged detour LSPs. In case detour LSPs are merged with 
                  the protected LSP, mplsOutSegmentIndex will point to the entry of 
                  the out segment table created for the protected LSP. In this case 
                  the mplsFrrDetourMergedDetourIndex object is not relevant. 
                
                  This table is optional and is only required in case mplsFrrPLRTable 
                  is supported. 
                
               4.4. mplsFrrHopTable 
                   
                  The mplsFrrHopTable contains the list of hops for explicit path 
                  (e.g., the content of the ERO of RSVP) and record path (e.g., the 
                  content of the RRO of RSVP) of a detour LSP. Each detour has two 
                  different sets of hops in this table: a set for the explicit path 
                  hops and another set for the record path hops, pointed by 
                  mplsFrrDetourExplicitPathIndex and the mplsFrrDetourRecordPathIndex, 
                  respectively, from the mplsFrrDetourTable. 
                   
                  This table is optional and is only required in case mplsFrrPLRTable 
                  is supported. 
                   
               4.5. mplsFrrInSegTable 
                   
                  The mplsFrrInSegTable contains a description of the incoming MPLS 
                  segment for a particular detour LSP and their associated parameters. 
                  The table also includes objects to measure the performance. 
                   
                  This table is optional and not required when LSR-MIB [4] is 
                  supported or mplsFrrPLRTable is not supported. 
                   
               4.6. mplsFrrOutSegTable 
                   
                 
               Cetin, et. al.                                                [Page 3]

                  The mplsFrrOutSegTable contains a description of the outgoing MPLS 
                  segment for a particular detour LSP and their associated parameters. 
                  The table also includes objects to measure the performance. 
                   
                  This table is optional and not required when LSR-MIB [4] is 
                  supported or mplsFrrPLRTable is not supported.

                  This MIB does not pose any additional security issues compared with 
                  [3] and [4].
