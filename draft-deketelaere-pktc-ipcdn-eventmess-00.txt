     Abstract 
      
        This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)  
        for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
        In particular, it provides a common data and format definition for  
        events and specifies by what means events are transmitted for  
        PacketCable/IPCablecom compliant Multimedia Terminal Adapter devices. 
        This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
        SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects are consistent with the 
        SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

     1.  The SNMP Management Framework 
      
        The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
        components: 
      
        o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1]. 
      
        o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
            purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
            Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
            16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The 
            second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 
            [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7]. 
      
        o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
            first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
            described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message 
            protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
            called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. 
            The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
            described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12]. 
      
        o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
            first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
            described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol 
            operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
            [13]. 
      
        o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and 
            the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
            [15]. 
      
        A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
        can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
        the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
        defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
      
        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
        MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
        translations. The resulting translated MIB MUST be semantically 
        equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
        translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
        information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
        SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
        readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
        MIB.

        This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
        PacketCable/IPCablecom compliant MultiMedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) devices. The  
        mechanisms to control the event reporting are defined in this document.  
      
     3.1.  Structure of the MIB 
      
        This MIB is structured as six groups: 
      
        o    Management information that controls the event reporting  
             (pktcDevEventControl). 
      
        o    Management information that configures the reporting of the various  
             programmable events (pktcDevEventConfig). 
      
        o    Management information that configures the event throttling control

        o    Management information that configures that allows the retrieval of events via  
             SNMP (pktcDevEventLocal). 
      
        o    Management information that specifies the information sent in traps and        
             informs (pktcDevEventNotify). 
      
        o    Management information that defines the trap and inform messages      
             (pktcDevEventNotification). 
      
        Tables within each of these groups group objects functionally. 
      
     3.1.1.  pktcDevEventControl 
      
         
        The objects in the pkctDevEventControl group control to where the syslog messages  
        will be send to and the clearing of the event log. 
      
        pkctDevEvControl -                     - this object is used to reset the event log and restore the  
        default event reporting settings.  
                                                             
        pkctDevEvSyslogAddressType -                              - the type of internet address for the syslog server, it  
        is not necessary to support all types. 
      
        pktcDevEvSyslogAddress -                          - the IP-address of the syslog server, this can also be a  
        FQDN, although the use of FQDN is discouraged. ?? Unicast vs broadcast 
      
        pkctDevEvSyslogUdpPort -                          - this object specifies the UDP-port to which the syslog  
        messages need to be send. 
        
      
     3.1.2.  pktcDevEventConfig 
      
        pktcDevEvProgrammableTable - This table configures the reporting of various  
        programmable events. By the use of this table it is possible to configure specific  
        events to have a specific priority or report a specific event message. Additionaly  
        the way of reporting (e.g. local, syslog, .. ) can be controlled. 
      
        pktcDevEvFixedTable - This table configures the reporting of fixed events. By the 
        use of this table it is possible to configure specific events to have a specific      
        priority or report a specific event message. Additionaly the way of reporting (e.g.  
        local, syslog, .. ) can be controlled. 
      
     3.1.3.  pktcDevEventThrottle 
      
        This group of objects controls the throttling of reporting events.  
      
     3.1.4.  pktcDevEventLocal 
      
        pktcDevEventTable -                      - this tables contains a log of network and device events that  
        can be retrieved by SNMP. The table can be cleared by using pkctDevEvControl.

     7.  Security Considerations 
      
         This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public 
         telephony service.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects 
         represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large 
         number of end-users. Improper manipulation of certain tables (e.g.  
         pktcDevEventThrottle) can result in the generation of a lot of network load. 
      
         SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
         itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no

     Internet Draft         PacketCable event management MTA MIB    June 2002 
      
         control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
         GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
      
         It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
         features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
         of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View- based 
         Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended. 
      
         It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
         entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
         configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
         (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
         (change/create/delete) them. 
           
            
     8.   Intellectual Property 
      
        The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
        intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
        pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
        this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
        might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
        has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
        IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
        standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of 
        claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of 
        licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to 
        obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
        proprietary rights by implementers or users of this specification can 
        be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
      
        The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
        copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
        rights that may cover technology that may be required to practice 
        this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
