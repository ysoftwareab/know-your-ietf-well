Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 supports a handoff between different access
   technologies, by which the assigned IP address is preserved
   regardless of the access technology type.  From the perspective of
   the mobile node, this involves the change of the network interfaces,
   through which the IP address is assigned and the IP session is
   established.  Some implementations, however, do not assume this
   interface switching in the middle of the session and it could cause a
   disconnection by the event of unavailability of the current
   interface; hence it is not guaranteed to be able to maintain the IP
   session simply by assigning the same IP address to the new interface.
   This document analyzes the handling of the network interfaces on the
   mobile node and presents several measures to avoid a disconnection
   due to the interface switching.

2.  Introduction

   RFC4831[RFC4831] addresses the support of an unmodified host as one
   of the goals for NETLMM; however, it also foresees additional
   functions in the physical and medium access control layers, typically
   wireless interface driver, on the mobile node for handover support or
   movement detection.  This issue becomes more visible when Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [PMIP6] is applied to inter-technology handoff, where the
   mobile node handles multiple interfaces.  When the mobile node hands
   off from one access technology to another, the corresponding
   interfaces are also switched.  Even if the same IP address (MN-HoA)
   is assigned to both interfaces, this interface switching could cause
   some problem.  When some application on the mobile node establishes a
   session, it binds a descriptor to the assigned IP address via the
   socket interface.  When this IP address is internally bound to one
   network interface, at the time when this interface is detached from
   the network and/or another interface is attached to the network, this
   session may lose connectivity.  Also, some point-to-point link device
   is ephemeral, that is, it exists only the link-layer connection is
   established.  If this is the case, the session on that link may not
   be transferred unless a new connection is established in a timely
   manner.  More detailed issues on network-based inter-technology
   handovers are described in [ITHO-PS].

   This document exhibits possible solutions to maintain sessions when
   inter-technology handover is performed, whereby the network has only
   to care about the IP address preservation.  The scope of this
   document is limited to the internal behavior of the mobile node and
   no interaction between the mobile node and network is specified.

3.   Handover Scenarios and requirements on the mobile node

   PMIPv6 ensures all the mobile access gateways (MAGs) in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain to use the same link-local and link-layer
   addresses on any of their access links.  Therefore, no matter which
   MAG the mobile node attaches to, it sees the same Router
   Advertisements, which prevents the mobile node from detecting the
   change of the network and the default router.  However, when the
   mobile node has two or more interfaces and the handover involves the
   change in the attached interface, it will raise an issue that would
   not occur in the case of a single interface.

   Suppose the mobile node has two interfaces.  Depending on the policy
   and/or radio environment, the following handover scenarios can be
   considered.


                          IF#1                 IF#2
                (a) -----------------|    |****************
                                     T1 < T2

                          IF#1                 IF#2
                (b) -------------------||******************
                                     T1 = T2

                          IF#1
                (c) ----------------------|    IF#2
                                     |*********************
                                     T2 < T1

                        Figure 1: Handoff scenarios

   (a)  There is a gap between the time when IF#1 is detached or
        deactivated (T1) and the time when IF#2 is attached or activated
        (T2).  During the time segment (T1, T2), the connectivity to the
        network is lost; however, the mobile node MUST retain all the
        sessions associated with the MN-HoA.  For incoming packets, all
        that are sent to IF#1 after T1 and all that are sent to IF#2
        before T2 will be lost if there is no buffering mechanism on the
        network side (there is nothing to do on the mobile node side).
        For outgoing packets, There SHOULD be a buffer on the mobile
        node and the active interface SHOULD always be detected and
        selected.

   (b)  Immediately after IF#1 is detached or deactivated, IF#2 is
        attached or activated.  For incoming packets, packet loss can be
        avoided if the active interface is always detected and selected.
        For outgoing packets, no buffer is required on the client side

        since always one interface is active at any point in time.

   (c)  IF#2 is attached or activated (T2) before IF#1 is detached or
        deactivated (T1).  In this case, both interfaces are active
        during the time segment (T2, T1).  For incoming packets, both
        interfaces SHOULD be able to receive them.  For outgoing
        packets, either one of the two interfaces SHOULD be selected at
        any given time.

4.  Operational issues

   This section exemplifies several operational issues on the mobile
   node that can affect the behavior of inter-technology handoff.  Some
   of those issues are attributed to the constraints of hardware and/or
   software implementations and also dependent on the operating system
   in use on the mobile node.

   o  Simultaneous use of multiple interfaces:
      Even if the mobile node has multiple interfaces, there could be
      some limitation that only one interface can be active at any given
      time due to the internal radio interferences.  This mode of
      operation is called the "single radio mode" and only scenario (a)
      (or ideally (b)) is feasible.  On the other hand, if multiple
      interfaces can be active at the same time, which is called the
      "dual (or multi) radio mode", scenario (c) becomes feasible.

   o  Address binding policy:
      Some operating system does not allow assigning the same IP address
      to multiple active interfaces.  If this is the case, even if the
      mobile node can run in dual radio mode, only scenario (a) (or
      ideally (b)) is feasible.  In the worst case, at the time when the
      current interface is turned down (T1), on-going IP session(s) is/
      are terminated.

   o  Relationship between network interfaces:
      When a point-to-point connection (e.g., PPP) is established for IP
      session(s), some operating system cannot retain that connection if
      the underlying interface (e.g., radio) becomes unavailable.  If
      this point-to-point connection is tightly coupled with the
      underlying interface, neither of the handoff scenarios is
      feasible.

5.  Example solutions for inter-technology handover support.

   There are multiple ways to retain sessions under the inter-technology
   handover accompanying the switching of interfaces.  This section
   describes example (non exclusive) solutions.

5.1.  Virtual interface adaptor

   In this solution, an intermediate logical interface called "virtual
   interface adaptor (VIA)" is used to hide the link movement from the
   IP layer.  The VIA is not bound to any physical interface and the MN-
   HoA is assigned to this adaptor.  Even if the active link is changed
   or deleted, the transport session is not aware of it.

                                +----------------------------+
                                |          TCP/UDP           |
             Session to IP   +->|                            |
             address binding |  +----------------------------+
                             +->|             IP             |
                  IP to VIA  +->|                            |
                  binding    |  +----------------------------+
                             +->|      Virtual IF Adaptor    |
             VIA to physical +->|           (MN-HoA)         |
               IF binding    |  +----------------------------+
                             +->|  L2  |  L2  |       |  L2  |
                                |(IF#1)|(IF#2)| ..... |(IF#n)|
                                +------+------+       +------+
                                |  L1  |  L1  |       |  L1  |
                                |      |      |       |      |
                                +------+------+       +------+

                    Figure 2: Virtual Interface Adaptor

   This solution is effective when the operating system tries to bind
   the assigned IP address to the active interface.  Even if that
   interface is disconnected or deactivated and there is a time gap
   until a new interface is activated such as the handover scenario (a)
   in Section 2, the VIA remains active and retains the session.  Not
   only for maintaining IP sessions, the VIA can also be the place to
   control those network interfaces for scenarios (b) or (c).
   Synchronizing with the network, the VIA switches from one interface
   to another and/or selects the outgoing interface among multiple
   active ones.

5.2.  Direct support

   Some operating system allows one IP address to be assigned to
   multiple interfaces and to be maintained regardless of the status of

Internet-Draft        PMIPv6 Inter-Tech HO Support          October 2009


   those interfaces.  In this case, by quickly switching one interface
   to another, scenario (b) can be asymptotically realized.  If dual
   radio mode can be assumed, by activating two interfaces, both of
   which have the same IP address, scenario (c) can be realized.  In
   either case, a proper trigger needs to be provided for the timing of
   the interface switching and in scenario (c), a proper policy to
   select the interface for outgoing packets needs to be provided as
   well.

                                +----------------------------+
                                |          TCP/UDP           |
