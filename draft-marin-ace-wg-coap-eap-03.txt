1.  Introduction

   The goal of this document is to describe an authentication service
   that uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748].
   The authentication service is built on top of the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] and allows authenticating two
   CoAP endpoints by using EAP without the need of additional protocols
   to bootstrap a security association between them.

   In particular, the document describes how CoAP can be used as EAP
   lower-layer [RFC3748] to transport EAP between a CoAP server (EAP
   peer) and the CoAP client (EAP authenticator) using CoAP messages.
   The CoAP client may contact with a backend AAA infrastructure to
   complete the EAP negotiation as described in the EAP specification
   [RFC3748].

   The assumption is that the EAP method transported in CoAP MUST
   generate cryptographic material [RFC5247] .  In this way, the CoAP
   messages can be protected.  There are two approaches that we have
   considered in this document:

   o  To define a new AUTH option that includes an authentication tag
      generated with the cryptographic material exported during an EAP
      authentication.  This new option is used to protect the integrity
      of the CoAP message that carries the AUTH option.  (NOTE:
      Encryption will be considered in the future).

   o  To establish a DTLS security association using the exported
      cryptographic material after a successful EAP authentication.

   This document also provides some comments about implementation of a
   proof-of-concept of this preliminary idea

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  General Architecture

   The Figure 1 shows the architecture defined in this document.
   Basically a node acting as the EAP peer wants to be authenticated by
   using EAP.  At the time of writing this document, we have considered
   a model where the EAP peer will act as CoAP server for this service
   and the EAP authenticator will act as CoAP client and may interact
   with a backend AAA infrastructure.  Nevertheless, a model where the
   EAP peer act as CoAP client and the EAP authenticator as CoAP server
   will be also analyzed in the future.

3.  General Flow Operation

   The authentication service uses the CoAP protocol as transport layer
   for EAP.  CoAP becomes an EAP lower-layer (in EAP terminology).  In
   general, it is assumed that, since the EAP authenticator may need to
   implement an AAA client to interact with the AAA infrastructure, this
   endpoint will have more resources.  We describe two different
   sequence flow.  First, it is shown in Figure 2 where the AUTH option
   is used at the end of EAP authentication.  Second diagram (see
   Figure 3) shows the flow when DTLS is used to protect CoAP messages

   at the end of the EAP authentication.  As an example, both diagrams
   show the usage of the EAP-PSK method [RFC4764] as authentication
   mechanism.  (NOTE: any EAP method which is able to export
   cryptographic material should be valid).

3.1.  EAP in CoAP with AUTH option

   If the EAP peer discovers the presence of the EAP authenticator and
   wants to start the authentication, it can send a Non-Confirmable
   "POST /auth" request to the node (Step 0).  This message, will carry
   an option developed from this work [I-D.tcs-coap-no-response-option]
   called no response.  The rationale of these options is avoiding
   having to listen to a response if is not needed.  So the use of this
   option will allow us to signal the intention of the EAP-Peer to start
   the authentication process.  Immediately after that, the EAP
   authenticator will start the authentication service.  It is worth
   noting that the EAP authenticator may decide to start the
   authentication without waiting for a "POST /auth" message.

   In any case, to perform the authentication service, the CoAP client
   (EAP authenticator) sends a Confirmable "POST /auth" request to the
   CoAP Server (Step 1).  POST message indicates to the CoAP server the
   creation of a resource for the EAP-based authentication service.  The
   CoAP server assigns a resource and answers with an Acknowledgment
   with the piggy-backed resource identifier (Uri-Path) (Step 2).  It is
   assumed that the CoAP server will only have an ongoing authentication
   and will not process simultaneous EAP authentications in parallel to
   save resources.  Moreover if after a period of time (TBD) no further
   message is received from the CoAP client, the CoAP server will free
   the created state.  In this moment, the CoAP server has started a
   resource for the EAP authentication, whose resource identifier value
   will be used together with the Token option value to relate all the
   EAP conversation between both CoAP endpoints.

   From now on, the EAP authenticator and the EAP peer will exchange EAP
   packets transported in the CoAP message payload (Steps
   3,4,5,6,7,8,9).  The EAP authenticator will use POST method to send
   EAP requests to the EAP peer.  The EAP peer will use a Piggy-backed
   response in the Acknowledgement message to carry the EAP response.
   At the end of the message exchanges, if everything has gone well, the
   EAP authenticator is able to send an EAP Success message and both
   CoAP endpoints will share a Master Session Key (MSK) ([RFC5295])

   If the new defined AUTH option is used, an authentication tag is
   generated with a new key named COAP_PSK, derived from the MSK.  The
   Acknowledgment message from the CoAP server will also include an AUTH
   option so that the CoAP client can verify that the CoAP server
   obtained the MSK.  This is shown in Steps 9 and 10.  From that point



Sanchez, et al.         Expires October 22, 2016                [Page 4]

   any exchange (for example, Steps 11 and 12) between both CoAP
   endpoints are protected with the AUTH option.  Finally, the CoAP
   client MAY send a Confirmable DELETE request to remove all the state
   related with the authentication service in the CoAP server (Steps 13
   and 14).  The CoAP server may decide to remove the state after period
   of time in case not receiving a DELETE request.  This may be easier
   if the EAP authenticator sends a session lifetime option (TBD) in the
   Step 9 (where the EAP Success is sent).

   On the contrary, if DTLS is used (see Figure 3), a DTLS_PSK is
   derived from the MSK.  Moreover, exchanges between both CoAP
   endpoints are protected with DTLS from that point.

3.2.  CoAP-EAP with DTLS

   Other possibility at our disposal is to do a DTLS handshake after the
   MSKs generation and continue the communication between endpoints
   using CoAP through DTLS as we can see at Figure 3.  The Steps 0-8 are
   the same as the case with AUTH option, however, before continuing
   with Steps 10 and 11, the EAP authenticator starts the DTLS handshake
   with the EAP peer (Step 9').  To establish a DTLS Security
   Association, a key named DTLS-PSK is derived from MSK (see Section 4
   ).  In this case the CoAP client can start DTLS before sending the
   last message containing the EAP Success.  Once DTLS is established,
   any posterior CoAP exchange is protected.  Thus, new AUTH option is
   not needed.  A successful DTLS negotiation confirms the possession of
   DTLS_PSK that, in turn, corroborates that both entities participated
   in the EAP authentication.

3.3.  Optimization Considerations

   Here we consider two possible optimizations for reducing the message
   length:

   o  A first optimization would be to reduce the URI of the
      bootstrapping service.  For example, the /auth URI could be
      reduced to /a.

   o  Another optimization would be to use a zero length CoAP token in
      the exchange.

   Some use cases as LoRA Networks [I-D.pelov-core-cosol] might take
   advantage of these reductions to improve the performance of the
   bootstrapping process.

4.  Key Derivation for protecting CoAP messages

   As a result of a successful EAP authentication, both CoAP server and
   CoAP client share a Master Key Session (MSK).  The assumption is that
   MSK is a fresh key so any derived key from the MSK will be also
   fresh.  We have considered the derivation of either COAP_PSK or
   DTLS_PSK.

4.1.  Deriving COAP_PSK

   A key COAP_PSK is derived from the MSK to generate the authentication
   tag included in the AUTH option.  COAP_PSK is derived by using AES-
   CMAC-PRF-128 [RFC4615], which, in turn, uses AES-CMAC-128 [RFC4493].
   In this case, rest of CoAP exchanges between both entities can be
   protected with integrity (NOTE: encryption will be considered in the
   future) with AUTH option without the need of using DTLS.  Thus, all
   CoAP messages MUST include AUTH option from that point.  (NOTE: We
   understand that this would not be the standard way of protecting CoAP
   but instead a new way of protecting CoAP messages).

   COAP_PSK is a 16-byte length key which is computed in the following
   way:

   COAP_PSK = KDF(MSK, "IETF_COAP_PSK" || nonce_c || nonce_s, 64,
   length)

   where:

   o  The AES-CMAC-PRF-128 is defined in [RFC4615].  This function uses
      AES-CMAC-128 as building block.

   o  The MSK exported by the EAP method.

   o  "IETF_COAP_PSK" is the ASCII code representation of the non-NULL
      terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).  This
      value is concatenated with the value of the Token Option value.

   o  nonce_c is the random value sent by the EAP Authenticator to the
      EAP Peer in the POST Message.

   o  nonce_s is the random value sent by the EAP Peer to the EAP
      Authenticator in the Acknowledgment to the POST Message.

   o  64 is the length of the MSK.

   o  length is the length of the label "IETF_COAP_PSK" (13 bytes).

4.2.  Deriving DTLS_PSK

   In the second alternative, a DTLS_PSK is derived from the MSK between
   both CoAP endpoints.  So far, DTLS_PSK will have also 16 byte length
   and it will derived as follows:

   DTLS_PSK = KDF(MSK, "IETF_DTLS_PSK" || nonce_c || nonce_s, 64,
   length).  This value is concatenated with the value of the Token
   Option value.

   where:

   o  MSK is exported by the EAP method.

   o  "IETF_DTLS_PSK" is the ASCII code representation of the non-NULL
      terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   o  nonce_c is the random value sent by the EAP Authenticator to the
      EAP Peer in the POST Message.

   o  nonce_s is the random value sent by the EAP Peer to the EAP
      Authenticator in the Acknowledgment to the POST Message.

   o  64 is the length of the MSK.

   o  length is the length of the label "IETF_DTLS_PSK" (13 bytes).

   As mentioned in [RFC4279], a PSK identity is needed.  We are
   considering the usage of the Token Option value chosen during the EAP
   authentication as identity.  In any case, this still needs further
   investigation.

5.  Generating AUTH option

   A new AUTH option is defined in this document for authentication
   purposes.  Following guidelines in [RFC7252] this option is:

   1.  Format opaque (sequence of bytes).

   2.  Elective.

   3.  Unsafe to Forward.

   4.  No cacheable.

   The number of the option will be determined by this previous
   decisions.

   1.  Elective (C = 0)

   2.  Unsafe to Forward (0)

   3.  NoCacheKey (111)

   The number of the AUTH option will fit this pattern: xxx11100

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                       |           | NoCacheKey| U | C |
                       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                     Figure 4: Auth Option Number Mask

   First available option number is 01011100 (92).

   The resultant AUTH option is:

                           Figure 5: AUTH Option

   C, U, N and R columns indicate the properties, Critical, UnSafe,
   NoCacheKey and Repeatable, respectively.

   To generate the value of the AUTH option, we use AES-CMAC-128 as
   authentication algorithm.  Thus, the AUTH option content will have an
   authentication tag of 16 bytes.

   AUTH Option value = AES-CMAC-128(COAP_PSK, MSG, MSG_LENGTH)

   where:

   o  COAP_PSK is the key derived in the CoAP Security Association
      process.

   o  MSG is the CoAP message including AUTH option filled with zeros.

   o  MSG_LENGTH.  Length of the CoAP message.

   After applying AES-CMAC-128 function, the AUTH option value will be
   set in the AUTH option replacing the zeros.

6.  Implementation

   At the time of writing this document, we have developed a proof-of-
   concept based on libcoap ([libCoAP]) in PC platform and started the
   development of a simulation with COOJA network simulator for Contiki
   ([Contiki]).

   So far, we have implemented an authentication tag by using AES-CMAC-
   128.  However this authentication tag has been included in the
   payload of two final messages after sending the EAP Success.  The
   implementation of the AUTH option will come soon.  Moreover, we have
   used AES-CMAC-128 for COAP_PSK.  Since this function does not allow a
   key longer than 16 bytes, we have used the most significative 16
   bytes of the MSK as input key.  Since AES-CMAC-PRF-128 eliminates
   this limitation, we will implement this version instead.

   We are using (for the PC version) libeap in wpa-supplicant and
   hostapd open source software ([hostapd]) to implement the EAP stack
   and, in particular, the EAP-PSK method.

7.  Future Work: CoAP Relay

   Architecture explained in Figure 1 assumes that EAP peer can
   communicate with the EAP authenticator.  In certain scenarios, EAP
   authenticator may not be reachable from the EAP peer if the EAP
   authenticator is placed several hops-away.  In this scenario,
   described in Figure 6, we are considering the usage a new service
   that assists the authentication.  This service acts as a relay of
   CoAP messages between the EAP peer and EAP authenticator.  We have
   called the entity in charge of performing this service CoAP relay.
   The strategy is similar to the one described in PANA Relay
   ([RFC6345]) or DTLS Relay ([I-D.kumar-dice-dtls-relay]).  Unlike CoAP
   proxy, the CoAP relay is not intended to keep any state (stateless
   behaviour) and the EAP peer is not assumed to be aware of the
   presence of the CoAP relay.  In any case, this part needs further
   investigation since CoAP already provides the concept of CoAP proxy
   and, particular, CoAP-to-CoAP proxy that might be used instead.

                    +--------------+



                   Figure 6: CoAP EAP Relay Architecture

   Once the EAP peer has been authenticated, CoAP relay service should
   not be needed anymore for this EAP peer.

   Development of this new service may modify the "Unsafe to Forward"
   flag of the AUTH option.

8.  Use Case Scenario

   In the following, we explain a basic example about the usage of CoAP-
   EAP.  There are 5 entities involved in the scenario:

   o  2 nodes (A and B), which are constrained devices.



Sanchez, et al.         Expires October 22, 2016               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                      April 2016


   o  1 node D, which is considered a no so constrained device, such as
      a phone, or a tablet or even a laptop.

   o  1 controller (C).  The controller manages a domain where nodes can
      be deployed.  It can be considered a more powerful machine than
      the nodes, however it may have some constrained resources.

   o  1 AAA server (AAA).  The AAA is an Authentication, Authorization
      and Accounting Server, which is not constrained.

   Any node wanting to join the domain managed by the controller, must
   perform and CoAP-EAP authentication with the controller C.  This
   authentication, as depicted in Figure 6, may involve an external AAA
   server.  This means that A and B, once deployed, will perform this
   CoAP-EAP once as a bootstrapping phase to establish a security
   association with the controller C.  Moreover, any other entity (i.e.
   node D) , which wants to join and establish communications with nodes
   under the controller C's domain must also do the same.

   One use case is the following.  The node A wants to communicate with
   node B (e.g. to active a light switch).  The overall process is
   divided in three phases.  Let's start with node A.  In the first
   phase, the node A (EAP peer) does not yet belong to the controller
   C's domain.  Then, it communicates with controller C (EAP
   authenticator) and authenticates with CoAP-EAP, which, in turn,
   communicates with the AAA server to complete the authentication
   process.  If the authentication is successful, key material is
   distributed to the controller C and derived by node A.  This key
   material allows node A to establish a security association with
   controller C.  Some authorization information may be also provided in
   this step.  If authentication and authorization are correct, node A
   is enrolled in the controller C's domain during a period of time.  In
   particular, [RFC5247] recommends 8 hours, though the AAA server can
   establish this lifetime.  In the same manner, B needs to perform the
   same process with CoAP-EAP to be part of the controller C's domain.

   In the second phase, when node A wants to talk with node B, it
   contacts the controller C for authorization to access node B and
   obtain all the required information to do that in a secure manner
   (e.g. keys, tokens, authorization information, etc.).  It does not
   require the usage of CoAP-EAP.  The details of this phase are out of
   scope of this document.

   In the third phase, the node A can access node B with the credentials
   and information obtained from the controller C in the second phase.
   This access can be repeated without contacting the controller, while
   the credentials given to A are still valid.  The details of this
   phase are out of scope of this document.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                      April 2016


   It is worth noting that first phase with CoAP-EAP is only required to
   join the controller C's domain.  Once it is performed with success,
   the communications are local to the controller C's domain so there is
   no need to contact the external AAA server.

   Another use case is the following.  Node D wants to communicate with
   node A (e.g. to obtain a temperature measurement).  To do that, first
   of all, node D must join the controller C's domain.  To do that it
   performs a CoAP-EAP authentication and authorization with the
   controller C (first phase).  If everything ends with success, the
   node D can request access to node A to C (second phase).  Then if
   node D is authorized can access to node A (third phase).  So, in the
   end, node D also implements CoAP-EAP as any other constrained node.
