1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is used to represent calendar
   data and is used with iTIP [RFC5546] to handle scheduling operations
   between calendar users. iCalendar is in widespread use, and in
   accordance with provisions in that specification, extension elements
   have been added by various vendors to the data format in order to
   support and enhance capabilities.  This specification collects a
   number of these ad-hoc extensions and uses the new IANA registry
   capability defined in [RFC5545] to register standard variants with
   clearly defined definitions and semantics.  In addition, some new

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions            July 2014


   elements are introduced for features that vendors have recently been
   requesting.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as
   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax elements shown below that
   are not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
   [RFC5545].

3.  Backwards Compatible Extension Properties

   iCalendar defines properties which can have different value types
   indicated by a "VALUE" parameter.  The definition of a property
   specifies a "default" value type that is assumed to be used when no
   "VALUE" parameter is present.  However, this poses a problem to
   iCalendar parser/generator software that does not know about the
   default values for new properties.  For example, if a new property
   "FOO" were defined with a default value type of URI, and a URI value
   with a comma was used, an iCalendar generator not aware of this fact
   would likely treat the property value as "TEXT" and apply backslash
   escaping to the comma in the value, effectively making it an invalid
   URI value.

   To avoid this problem, this specification recommends that all
   properties not defined in [RFC5545], always include a "VALUE"
   parameter, if the type is other than "TEXT". i.e., in the example
   above, the "FOO" property would have a "VALUE=URI" parameter.  This
   allows iCalendar parser/generator software to track the correct types
   of unknown properties.

   New properties defined in this specification use the term "no
   default" in the "Value Type" definition to indicate that the "VALUE"
   parameter has to be included.

4.  Modifications to Calendar Components

   The following changes to the syntax defined in iCalendar [RFC5545]
   are made here.  New elements are defined in subsequent sections.

      refreshed from.

   Value Type:  URI - no default

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  This property identifies a location where a client can
      retrieve updated data for the calendar.  Clients SHOULD honor any
      specified "REFRESH-INTERVAL" value when periodically retrieving
      data.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   source       = "SOURCE" sourceparam ":" uri CRLF

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   color          = "COLOR" colorparam ":" text CRLF
                     ; Value is CSS3 color name

   colorparam     = *(";" other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   COLOR:turquoise

5.10.  IMAGE Property

   Property Name:  IMAGE

   Purpose:  This property specifies an image associated with the
      calendar or a calendar component.

   Value Type:  URI or BINARY - no default.  The value MUST refer to or
      be data with a media type of "image".

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, display, inline encoding,
      and value data type property parameters can be specified on this
      property.  The format type parameter can be specified on this
      property and is RECOMMENDED for inline binary encoded content
      information.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object, or "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar
      components.

   Description:  This property specifies an image for an iCalendar
      object or a calendar component via a uri or directly with inline
      data that can be used by calendar user agents when presenting the
      calendar data to a user.  Multiple properties MAY be used to
      specify alternative sets of images with, for example, varying
      media subtypes, resolutions or sizes.  When multiple properties
      are present, calendar user agents SHOULD display only one of them,
      picking one that provides the most appropriate image quality, or
      display none.  The "DISPLAY" parameter is used to indicate the
      intended display mode for the image.  The "ALTREP" parameter,
      defined in [RFC5545], can be used to provide a "clickable" image
      where the URI in the parameter value can be "launched" by a click
      on the image in the calendar user agent.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

5.11.  CONFERENCE Property

   Property Name:  CONFERENCE

   Purpose:  This property specifies information for accessing a
      conferencing system.

   Value Type:  URI - no default.

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions            July 2014


   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, feature, and label property
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in a
      "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.

   Description:  This property specifies information for accessing a
      conferencing system for attendees of a meeting or task.  This
      might be a tel: URI [RFC3466] for a telephone-based conference
      number dial-in (with access codes included), or it might be an
      http: URI [RFC7230] for a web-based video chat, or a URI for an
      instant messaging group chat room.  If a specific URI for a
      conferencing system is not available, a data: URI [RFC2397]
      containing a text description can be used.

      A conference system can be a bi-directional communication channel,
      or a uni-directional "broadcast feed".

      The "FEATURE" property parameter is used to describe the key
      capabilities of the conference system to allow a client to choose
      the ones that give the required level of interaction from a set of
      multiple properties.

      The "LABEL" property paramater is used to convey additional
      details on the use of the URI.  For example, the URIs or access
      codes for the moderator and attendee of a teleconference system
      could be different, and the "LABEL" property parameter could be
      used to "tag" each "CONFERENCE" property to indicate which is
      which.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

6.  Property Parameters

6.1.  DISPLAY Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  DISPLAY

   Purpose:  To specify different ways in which an image for a calendar
      or component can be displayed.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

 displayparam = "DISPLAY" "=" displayval *("," displayval)

 displayval =   ("BADGE" /    ; image inline with the title of the event
                 "GRAPHIC" /  ; a full image replacement for the event
                              ; itself
                 "FULLSIZE /  ; an image that is used to enhance the

                 "THUMBNAIL / ; a smaller variant of "FULLSIZE" to be
                              ; used when space for the image is

                 x-name /     ; Experimental type
                 iana-token)  ; Other IANA registered type
                              ;
                              ; Default is BADGE

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on "IMAGE"
      properties.  In the absence of this parameter, the value "BADGE"
      MUST be used for the default behavior.  The value determines how a
      client ought to present an image supplied in iCalendar data to the
      user.

      Values for this parameter are registered with IANA as per
      Section 8.3.  New values can be added to this registry following
      the procedure outlined in Section 8.2.1 of [RFC5545].

      Servers and clients MUST handle x-name and iana-token values they
      don't recognize by not displaying any image at all.

   Example:

   IMAGE;VALUE=URI;DISPLAY=BADGE,THUMBNAIL,;FMTTYPE=image/png:http://exa
    mple.com/images/weather-cloudy.png

6.2.  EMAIL Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  EMAIL

   Purpose:  To specify an email address that is used to identify or
      contact an organizer or attendee.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   emailparam = "EMAIL" "=" param-value

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on "ORGANIZER"
      or "ATTENDEE" properties.  This property can be used in situations
      where the calendar user address value of "ORGANIZER" and

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions            July 2014


      "ATTENDEE" properties is not likely to be an identifier that
      recipients of scheduling messages could use to match the calendar
      user with, for example, an address book entry.  The value of this
      property is an email address that can easily be matched by
      recipients.  Recipients can also use this value as an alternative
      means of contacting the calendar user via email.  If a recipient's
      calendar user agent allows the recipient to save contact
      information based on the "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE" properties,
      those calendar user agents SHOULD use any "EMAIL" property
      parameter value for the email address of the contact over any
      mailto: calendar user address specified as the value of the
      property.  Calendar user agents SHOULD NOT include an "EMAIL"
      property parameter when its value matches the calendar user
      address specified as the value of the property.

   Example:

   ATTENDEE;CN=Cyrus Daboo;EMAIL=cyrus@example.com:mailto:opaque-toke
    n-1234@example.com

6.3.  FEATURE Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  FEATURE

   Purpose:  To specify a feature or features of a conference or
      broadcast system.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   featureparam = "FEATURE" "=" featuretext *("," featuretext)
   featuretext  =  ("AUDIO" /     ; Audio capability
                    "CHAT" /      ; Chat or instant messaging
                    "FEED" /      ; Blog or Atom feed
                    "MODERATOR" / ; Moderator dial-in code
                    "PHONE" /     ; Phone conference
                    "SCREEN" /    ; Screen sharing
                    "VIDEO" /     ; Video capability
                    x-name /      ; Experimental type
                    iana-token)   ; Other IANA registered type

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on the
      "CONFERENCE" property.  Multiple values can be specified.  The
      "MODERATOR" value is used to indicate that the property value is
      specific to the owner/initiator of the conference and contains a
      URI that "activates" the system (e.g., a "moderator" access code
      for a phone conference system that is different from the "regular"
      access code).

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions            July 2014


   Example:

   CONFERENCE;VALUE=URI;FEATURE=AUDIO:rtsp://audio.example.com/
    event
   CONFERENCE;VALUE=URI;FEATURE=AUDIO,VIDEO:http://video-chat.exam
    ple.com/;group-id=1234

6.4.  LABEL Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  LABEL

   Purpose:  To provide a human readable label.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   infoparam = "LABEL" "=" param-value

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on the
      "CONFERENCE" property.  It is anticipated that other extensions to
      iCalendar will re-use this property parameter on new properties
      that they define.  As a result, clients SHOULD expect to find this
      property parameter present on many different properties.  It
      provides a human readable label that can be presented to calendar
      users to allow them to discriminate between properties which might
      be similar, or provide additional information for properties that
      are not self-describing.

   Example:

   CONFERENCE;VALUE=URI;FEATURE=VIDEO;
    LABEL="Web video chat, access code=76543";
    :http://video-chat.example.com/;group-id=1234

7.  Security Considerations

   Several of the new properties or parameters defined by this
   specification allow reference to "external" URIs.  Care MUST be taken
   when accessing data at external URIs as malicious content could be
   present.  In addition, access to those URIs could be tracked, leading
   to loss of privacy.

   The "CONFERENCE" property can include a "FEATURE" property parameter
   with a "MODERATOR" value.  In some cases the access code used by the
   owner/initiator of a conference might be private to an individual and
   clients and servers MUST ensure that such properties are not sent to
   attendees of a scheduled component, or sharees of a shared component.
