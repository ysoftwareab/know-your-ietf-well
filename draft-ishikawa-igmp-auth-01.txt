Abstract


      The security enhancement is one of the most important enhancements
      to IP multicast. IP multicast requires many security functions that
      include user authentication of IP multicast, encryption of IP
      multicast datagrams and key management protocols for IP multicast.
      Among them, the user authentication function for IP multicast is
      considered one of the most important security functions for IP
      multicast. This document describes the extension to IGMP, version 2
      (IGMPv2) [1] for the authentication of IP multicast senders and
      receivers, which prevents an unauthorized user from sending and
      receiving IP multicast datagrams.

1. Introduction

   The rapid deployment of IP multicast over the Internet has been
   realized by MBone, an experimental IP multicast network over the
   Internet. IP multicast is at the experimental stage. In order to make
   IP multicast a commercial service, several enhancements to IP multicast
   are required. Such enhancements include security, accounting, QOS and
   IP multicast address allocation. Among them, the security enhancement
   is one of the most important enhancements to IP multicast. IP multicast
   requires many security functions that include user authentication of IP
   multicast, encryption of IP multicast datagrams and key management
   protocols for IP multicast. Among them, the user authentication function
   for IP multicast is considered one of the most important security
   functions for IP multicast.

   This document describes the extension to IGMPv2 for the authentication
   of IP multicast senders and receivers, which prevents an unauthorized
   user from sending and receiving IP multicast datagrams. The term "IP
   multicast sender/receiver" is extensively used in this document. "IP
   multicast sender/receiver" is defined as an user entity to be
   authenticated in a sending/receiving host.

2. Requirements

   The design requirements on the user authentication functions for IP
   multicast are described below.

   (1) Authentication of IP Multicast Sender: In the case of IP multicast,
       IP multicast datagrams sent by a sender will be simultaneously
       delivered to many receivers distributed over the Internet. If a
       sender sends IP multicast datagrams erroneously or maliciously, the
       overall Internet is burdened with the undesirable traffic and
       receivers may misunderstand that IP multicast datagrams received
       from the malicious sender are valid. Since anyone can send IP
       multicast datagrams to the Internet, it is easy to inject such
       traffic into the Internet. Therefore, it is important to confine
       only an authorized sender to sending IP multicast datagrams.

   (2) Authentication of IP Multicast Receiver: Anyone can receive IP
       multicast datagrams from the Internet. However, when delivering
       charged contents to authorized receivers, it is desirable not to
       deliver them to unauthorized receivers, even if charged contents
       are encrypted. In addition, the extra traffic caused by delivering
       them to unauthorized receivers is useless and should be avoidable.
       Therefore, it is important to confine only an authorized receiver
       to receiving IP multicast datagrams.

   (3) IP Multicast Routing Protocols: IP multicast routing protocols such
       as DVMRP [2], PIM [3] and CBT [4] have been developed within IETF.
       The user authentication function for IP multicast should be
       independent of such IP multicast routing protocols, and hence
       should not depend on a specific IP multicast routing protocol.

   This document describes the extension to IGMPv2, which satisfies the
   above requirements.

3. Architecture

   The overall architecture for the authentication of IP multicast senders
   and receivers is described below.

   An IP multicast sender sends IP multicast datagrams to an ingress
   router in an IP multicast network. IP multicast datagrams travel
   egress routers through IP multicast routers within an IP multicast
   network. An IP multicast routing is controlled by IP multicast routing
   protocols such as DVMRP, PIM and CBT. An egress router sends IP
   multicast datagrams to IP multicast receivers which join the host
   group.

   This document describes the user authentication functions of IP
   multicast, using the Challenge-Response mechanism in a similar way as
   CHAP [5].

   NOTE: Other mechanisms for the user authentication functions of IP
         Multicast are for further study.

   When an IP multicast sender starts to send IP multicast datagrams,
   an ingress router may optionally authenticate it, using the challenge-
   response mechanism. An ingress router may optionally use RADIUS as the
   authentication server, when authenticating the IP multicast sender.

   NOTE: The interaction between a multicast router and a RADIUS server
         is described in Appendix A. The separate document [6] describes
         the extensions to RADIUS [7] for the authentication of IP
         multicast senders and receivers.

   When the result of the authentication is successful, IP multicast
   datagrams sent by the IP multicast sender travel towards egress
   routers through IP multicast routers. When the result of the
   authentication is not successful, the ingress router silently discards
   IP multicast datagrams sent by the IP multicast sender. This mechanism
   prevents an unauthorized user from sending IP multicast datagrams to
   the Internet.

   When an IP multicast receiver starts to receive IP multicast
   datagrams, an egress router may optionally authenticate it, using the
   challenge-response mechanism. An egress router may optionally use
   RADIUS as the authentication server, when authenticating the IP
   multicast receiver. When the result of the authentication is
   successful, the egress router starts to transmit IP multicast datagrams
   to the IP multicast receiver. When the result of the authentication is
   not successful, the egress router does not transmit IP multicast
   datagrams to the IP multicast receiver. This mechanism prevents an
   unauthorized user from receiving IP multicast datagrams from the
   Internet.

   There are two levels of multicast routers.

   (1) Level 1: Unsecure Multicast Router
       The multicast router complies with IGMPv2.

   (2) Level 2: Secure Multicast Router
       The multicast router complies with both IGMPv2 and this document.

   All multicast routers in a subnetwork must be either secure or
   unsecure. In other words, unsecure multicast routers and secure
   multicast routers must not coexist in the same subnetwork.

4. Protocol Description

   This section describes the mechanisms for the user authentication
   functions of IP multicast.

4.1 Procedures for Authentication of IP Multicast Senders

4.1.1 Operation of Sending hosts

   When an IP multicast sender wants to send IP multicast datagrams, a
   sending host sends a Sender Start message to a multicast router.
   When [Retry Interval] expires, a sending host resends a Sender Start
   message to a multicast router, until a Challenge message is received,
   or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Challenge message is received, A sending host sends a Response
   message to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval] expires, a
   sending host resends a Response message to a multicast router, until
   a Success or Failure message is received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Success message is received, a sending host starts to send IP
   multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a sending
   host is not allowed to send IP multicast datagrams.

   After a sending host starts to send IP multicast datagrams, it may
   receive a Challenge message. When a Challenge message is received,
   a sending host sends a Response message to a multicast router. After a
   sending host sends a Response message, it may receive the same
   Challenge message. In this case, a sending host resends the same
   Response message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Response message was lost.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IGMP User Authentication           August, 1998

   When [Retry Interval] expires, a sending host resends a Response
   message to a multicast router, until a Success or Failure message is
   received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Success message is received, a sending host can continue to
   send IP multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a
   sending host stops to send IP multicast datagrams.

4.1.2 Operation of Multicast Routers

   When a multicast router receives a Sender Start message, it sends a
   Challenge message to the sending host which sent the Sender Start
   message. After a multicast router sent the Challenge message, it may
   receive the same Sender Start message. In this case, a multicast
   router resends the same Challenge message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Challenge message was lost.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   IP multicast sender. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a
   RADIUS server to authenticate the IP multicast sender.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the sending host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the sending host. After a multicast router sent the Success
   message, it may receive the same Response message. In this case, a
   multicast router resends the same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

   A multicast router manages a list of IP addresses of authenticated IP
   multicast senders regarding each host group with a destination port.
   When the authentication of the IP multicast sender is successful, a
   multicast router adds its IP address to the list.

   When a multicast router receives an IP multicast datagram from a
   sending host, it checks the source IP address of the received IP
   multicast datagram. If the source IP address was registered in the
   list of IP addresses of authenticated IP multicast senders, a multicast
   router forwards the received IP multicast datagrams. If the source IP
   address was not registered in the list of IP addresses of authenticated
   IP multicast senders, a multicast router silently discards the received
   IP multicast datagrams.

   The [Validity Period] of the authentication of an IP multicast sender
   is set in the authentication parameter of a Success message. If the
   [Validity Period] expires, a multicast router may reauthenticate the IP
   multicast sender.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IGMP User Authentication           August, 1998

   When a multicast router reauthenticates the IP multicast sender, it
   sends a Challenge message. When a [Retry Interval] expires, the
   multicast router resends a Challenge message, until a Response message
   is received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   IP multicast sender. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a RADIUS
   server to authenticate the IP multicast sender.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the sending host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the sending host. After a multicast router sent the Success
   message, it may receive the same Response message. In this case, a
   multicast router resends the same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

   A multicast router deletes the IP address of an IP multicast sender
   from a list of IP addresses of authenticated IP multicast senders, in
   the following cases.

   - When the [Validity Period] of the authentication of an IP multicast
     sender expires, a multicast router does not want to reauthenticate
     it.
   - The reauthentication of an IP multicast sender is not successful.

4.2 Procedures for Authentication of IP multicast Receivers

4.2.1 Operation of Receiving Hosts

   When an IP multicast receiver wants to receive IP multicast datagrams,
   a receiving host sends a Membership Report message with an
   authentication parameter to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval]
   expires, a receiving host resends a Membership Report message to a
   multicast router, until a Challenge message is received, or [Retry
   Count] expires.

   When a Challenge message is received, a receiving host sends a
   Response message to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval] expires,
   a receiving host resends a Response message to a multicast router,
   until a Success or Failure message is received, or [Retry Count]
   expires.

   When a Success message is received, a receiving host starts to receive
   IP multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a receiving
   host is not allowed to receive IP multicast datagrams.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IGMP User Authentication           August, 1998

   After a receiving host starts to receive IP multicast datagrams, it
   may receive a Group-Specific Query message with a reason parameter
   (reason = "reauthentication is required"). When a Group-Specific Query
   message with a reason parameter (reason = "reauthentication is
   required") is received, a receiving host sets a delay timer to a random
   value selected from the range (0, Max Response Time) for the host group
   being queried. Max Response Time is specified in the Group-Specific
   Query message. If the receiving host receives another Membership Report
   message with an authentication parameter while the timer is running, it
   stops the timer for the host group and does not send a Membership
   Report message with an authentication parameter, in order to suppress
   duplicate Membership Report messages.

   When the timer expires, the receiving host sends a Membership Report
   message with an authentication parameter to a multicast router. When
   [Retry Interval] expires, a receiving host resends a Membership Report
   message to a multicast router, until a Challenge message is received,
   or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Challenge message is received, a receiving host sends a Response
   message to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval] expires, a
   receiving host resends a Response message to a multicast router, until
   a Success or Failure message is received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Success message is received, a receiving host can continue to
   receive IP multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a
   receiving host stops to receive IP multicast datagrams.

4.2.2 Operation of Multicast Routers

   When a multicast router receives a Membership Report message with an
   authentication parameter, it sends a Challenge message to the receiving
   host which sent the Membership Report message. After a multicast router
   sent the Challenge message, it may receive the same Membership Report
   message. In this case, a multicast router resends the same Challenge
   message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Challenge message was lost.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   IP multicast receiver. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a
   RADIUS server to authenticate the IP multicast receiver.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the receiving host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the receiving host. After a multicast router sent the
   Success message, it may receive the same Response message. In this case,
   a multicast router resends the same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IGMP User Authentication           August, 1998

   A multicast router manages a list of group addresses of host groups
   which have at least one authenticated IP multicast receiver for each of
   its attached networks. When the authentication of the IP multicast
   receiver is successful, a multicast router adds the address of the host
   group which the receiving host wants to join to the list, unless the
   address is already registered in the list.

   The [Validity Period] of the authentication of an IP multicast receiver
   is set in the authentication parameter of a Success message. If the
   [Validity Period] expires, a multicast router may reauthenticate the
   IP multicast receiver.

   When a multicast router reauthenticates the IP multicast receiver, it
   sends a Group-Specific Query message with a reason parameter ( reason =
   "reauthentication is required"). The Group-Specific Query message has
   the Max Response Time set to [Reauthentication Query Interval]. When a
   [Reauthentication Query Interval] expires, the multicast router resends
   the Group-Specific Query message, until a Membership Report message with
   an authentication parameter is received, or a [Retry Count] expires.

   When a multicast router receives a Membership Report message with an
   authentication parameter, it sends a Challenge message to the receiving
   host which sent the Membership Report message. After a multicast router
   sent the Challenge message, it may receive the same Membership Report
   message. In this case, a multicast router resends the same Challenge
   message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Challenge message was lost.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   IP multicast receiver. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a
   RADIUS server to authenticate the IP multicast receiver.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the receiving host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the receiving host. When the result of the authentication
   is not successful, the multicast router resends a Group-Specific Query
   message with a reason parameter ( reason = "reauthentication is
   required"), until the authentication succeeds, or [Retry Count] expires.

   After a multicast router sent the Success message, it may receive the
   same Response message. In this case, a multicast router resends the
   same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IGMP User Authentication           August, 1998

   A multicast router deletes the address of the host group from a list of
   the addresses of host groups which have at least one authenticated
   IP multicast receiver, in the following cases.

   - When the [Validity Period] of the authentication of an IP multicast
     receiver expires, a multicast router does not want to reauthenticate
     it.
   - The reauthentication of an IP multicast receiver host is not
     successful.
   - A multicast router finds that there are no local members for the
     host group in accordance with IGMPv2.

   When a multicast router receives a Membership Report message without an
   authentication parameter, it silently discards the received Membership
   Report message, if the group address set in the Membership Report
   message is not registered in the list of the addresses of host groups
   which have at least one authenticated IP multicast receiver.

   NOTE: A multicast router receives a Membership Report message without
         an authentication parameter as the  response to a Membership
         Query, in accordance with IGMPv2.

5. Compatibility with IGMPv2 Hosts

5.1 Compatibility with IGMPv2 Sending Hosts

   A sending host which only complies with IGMPv2 sends IP multicast
   datagrams without having any authentication procedures. To keep the
   compatibility with IGMPv2 compliant sending hosts, a sending host may
   send IP multicast datagrams to a host group with a destination port
   without having any authentication procedures, unless it is explicitly
   stated that only an authenticated IP multicast sender may send IP
   multicast datagrams to the host group with the destination port. An
   ingress router must manage the access control list for host groups
   with destination ports. If the host group with the destination port
   is included in the access control list, only an authenticated IP
   multicast sender may send IP multicast datagrams to the host group
   with the destination port. Otherwise, a sending host may send IP
   multicast datagrams to the host group with the destination port
   without having any authentication procedures.

5.2 Compatibility with IGMPv2 Receiving Hosts

   A receiving host which only complies with IGMPv2 may receive IP
   multicast datagrams without having any authentication procedures. To
   keep the compatibility with IGMPv2 compliant receiving hosts, a
   receiving host may join a host group without having any authentication
   procedures, unless it is explicitly stated that only an authenticated
   IP multicast receiver may join the host group. An egress router must
   manage the access control list for host groups. If the host group is
   included in the access control list, only an authenticated IP multicast

   receiver may join the host group and receive IP multicast datagrams
   sent to the host group. Otherwise, a receiving host may join the host
   group and receive IP multicast datagrams sent to the host group,
   without having any authentication procedures.

6. Extensions to IGMPv2 Messages

   The following messages and parameters are added to IGMPv2 for the
   authentication of IP multicast senders and receivers.

6.1 New Messages

   The format of new messages is as follows.

    0                   1                   2                   3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Type       | Max Resp Time |     Checksum                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Group    Address                          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Destination Port          |     Unused                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   (1) Type

       The types of new messages are as follows:

       0x21 = Sender Start
       0x22 = Challenge
       0x23 = Response
       0x24 = Success
       0x25 = Failure

   (2) Max Response Time

       The use of this field is same as specified in IGMPv2.

   (3) Checksum

       The use of this field is same as specified in IGMPv2.

   (4) Group Address

       In a Sender Start message, the address of the host group to which
       an IP multicast sender wants to send IP multicast datagrams is set
       to the group address field.

       In a Challenge, Response, Success or Failure message, the group
       address field is set to zero.


Ishikawa, Yamanouchi, Takahashi     Expires February 1999      [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT           IGMP User Authentication           August, 1998

   (5) Destination Port

       In a Sender Start message, the destination port combined with the
       host group to which an IP multicast sender wants to send IP
       multicast datagrams is set to the destination port field. The value
       all "1"s has a special meaning. If this value is set to the
       destination port field, it means that the IP multicast sender wants
       to send IP multicast datagrams to the host group with any
       destination port.

       In a Challenge, Response, Success or Failure message, the group
       address field is set to zero.

6.2 Optional Parameters

   The following optional parameters may be set following the fixed fields
   of IGMP messages.

   The format of the optional parameters is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Option1  |  Option2  |  ...                    | Padding |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Thus, padding is added in the end, in order to complete them in 32-bit
   boundary. The value of padding is zero.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Option Type  |  Option Data Length  | Option Data        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   - Option Type:        An 8-bit identifier of the option type
   - Option Data Length: Length of the option data in octet (8 bits)
   - Option Data:        Data specific to each option with variable length

6.2.1 Optional Parameters for the Group-Specific Query Message

   (1) Reason

       This parameter specifies the reason why the Group-Specific Query
       message is sent by a multicast router.

       Option Type: 1

       The format of the option data is as follows:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Reason      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Reason: This field is one octet (8 bits). This field specifies the
               reason why the Group-Specific Query message is sent by a
               multicast router.

               1 = a Leave Group message is received by a multicast router
               2 = a reauthentication is required

       NOTE: If this parameter is omitted, The value "1" (a Leave Group
             message is received) is assumed.

6.2.2 Optional Parameters for the Version 2 Membership Report Message
      and the Sender Start Message

   (1) Authentication

       This parameter of a Version 2 Membership Report message is used to
       authenticate an user on a receiving host which wants to receive IP
       multicast datagrams. This parameter of a Sender Start message is used
       to authenticate an user on a sending host which wants to send IP
       multicast datagrams.

       Option Type: 1

       The format of the option data is as follows:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Mechanism  | Identifier  | User-ID                        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Mechanism: An 8-bit identifier of the mechanism for the
                  authentication of a receiving or sending host.

                  1 = the authentication mechanism specified in this document

       NOTE: Other authentication mechanisms are for further study.

       Identifier: This field is one octet (8 bits). This field is used to
                   identify the sequence for the authentication of an IP
                   multicast receiver or sender. When a new authentication
                   starts, this field must be changed.

       User-ID: The User-ID field is one or more octets representing the
                identification of an user on a receiving or sending host
                to be authenticated. An User-ID may be ASCII character
                strings or an e-mail address of an user.

6.2.3 Optional Parameters for the Challenge Message and the Response
      Message

   (1) Authentication

       Option Type: 1

       The format of the option data is as follows:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Identifier | Value-Size | Value                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | User-ID                                                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Identifier: This field is one octet (8 bits). When a Challenge
                   message is sent, this field must be copied from the
                   Identifier field of the preceding Version 2 Membership
                   Report or Sender Start message. When a Response message
                   is sent, this field must be copied from the Identifier
                   field of the preceding Challenge message.

       Value-Size: This field is one octet and indicates the length of the
                   Value field.

       Value: The Value field is one or more octets.

              The Challenge Value is a variable stream of octets. Each
              Challenge Value should be unique, since repetition of a
              challenge value in conjunction with the same secret would
              permit an attacker to reply with a previously intercepted
              response. The Challenge Value must be changed each time a
              Challenge message is sent. The length of the Challenge Value
              depends upon the method used to generate the octets, and is
              independent of the hash algorithm used.

              The Response Value is the one-way hash calculated over a
              stream of octets consisting of the Identifier, followed by
              (concatenated with) the "secret", followed by (concatenated
              with) the Challenge Value. The length of the Response Value
              depends upon the hash algorithm used. MD5 [8] is used as the
              hash algorithm. In the case of MD5, The length of the
              Response Value is 16 octets.

              The length of "secret" must be at least 1 octet. The "secret"
              should be at least as large and unguessable as a well-chosen
              password.

       User-ID: The User-ID field is one or more octets representing the
                identification of an user on a receiving or sending host
                to be authenticated. An User-ID may be ASCII character
                strings or an e-mail address of an user.

6.2.4 Optional Parameters for the Success Message

   (1) Authentication

       This parameter is used to authenticate an user on a receiving host
       which wants to receive IP multicast datagrams and an user on a
       sending host which wants to send IP multicast datagrams.

       Option Type: 1

       The format of the option data is as follows:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Identifier  | Validity-Period | Message                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Identifier: This field is one octet (8 bits). When a Success or
                   Failure message is sent, this field must be copied from
                   the Identifier field of the preceding Response message.

                        specifies the period of the validity for the
                        authentication of an user on a receiving or sending
                        host in units of second. When a Success message is
                        sent, a multicast router specifies the validity
                        period for the authentication.

Appendix A.  Interaction with the RADIUS Server

   This appendix gives an outline of the interaction between a secure
   multicast router and a RADIUS server. The detailed specifications of the
   interaction between them are described in [6].

A.1 Interaction with the RADIUS Server for the Authentication of IP
    Multicast Senders and Receivers

A.1.1 Interaction with the RADIUS Server for the Authentication of IP
      Multicast Senders

   When a multicast router receives a Response message from a sending host,
   it sends an Access-Request message in RADIUS to a RADIUS server.

   When the multicast router receives an Access-Accept message in RADIUS
   from the RADIUS server, it sends a Success message to the sending host.
   When the multicast router receives an Access-Reject message in RADIUS,
   it sends a Failure message to the sending host.

A.1.2 Interaction with the RADIUS Server for the Authentication of IP
      Multicast Receivers

   When a multicast router receives a Response message from a receiving
   host, it sends an Access-Request message in RADIUS to a RADIUS server.

   When the multicast router receives an Access-Accept message in RADIUS
   from the RADIUS server, it sends a Success message to the receiving host.
   When the multicast router receives an Access-Reject message in RADIUS,
   it sends a Failure message to the receiving host.

Appendix B. Issues

B.1 IP Multicast Receivers on Shared Media Networks

   Once one IP multicast receiver on a shared media network such as
   Ethernet is authenticated, a multicast router starts to send IP
   multicast datagrams to the network. As a result, other IP multicast
   receivers on the network can receive IP multicast datagrams, even if
   they are not authenticated.

   The most straightforward solution on this issue is the use of
   encryption. One possible scenario for the solution is as follows.

   When the authentication of an IP multicast sender is successful, an
   ingress router sends a group key (i.e. symmetric key) to the IP
   multicast sender, as the parameter of a Success message. The key is
   encrypted with the public key of the IP multicast sender. The IP
   multicast sender encrypts IP multicast datagrams with the group
   key and sends them to the ingress router.

   Similarly, when the authentication of an IP multicast receiver is
   successful, an egress router sends a group key to the IP multicast
   receiver, as the parameter of a Success message. The key is encrypted
   with the public key of the IP multicast receiver. The egress router
   transmits IP multicast datagrams encrypted with the group key to the
   IP multicast receiver. The IP multicast receiver decrypts IP multicast
   datagrams received, using the group key.

   It is assumed that a group key for the host group is generated when
   the address of the host group is assigned to the host group. Protocols
   for group key management and distribution are for further study.

B.2 Granularity on Filtering of IP multicast Datagrams

   An ingress router drops IP multicast datagrams sent from unauthenticated
   IP multicast senders, based on only their source IP addresses, even if
   user-IDs are used for authenticating IP multicast senders.

B.3 Quick detection of Sender Leave

   When the reauthentication of an IP multicast sender fails, a multicast
   router detects the leave of the IP multicast sender.

   To detect the leave of an IP multicast sender more quickly, it is
   necessary to define a new message (i.e. Sender Stop message). When an IP
   multicast sender stops sending IP multicast datagrams, a sending host
   sends a Sender Stop message to a multicast router. When a multicast
   router receives a Sender Stop message from a sending host, the multicast
   router detects the leave of the IP multicast sender. This mechanism
   allows a multicast router to detect the leave of an IP multicast sender
   more quickly.
