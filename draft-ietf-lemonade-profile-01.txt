Abstract 
    
   This document describes the Lemonade profile to allow clients to 
   submit new email messages incorporating content which resides on 
   locations external to the client ("forward without download").  
    
   The Lemonade profile relies upon extensions to other protocols; 
   specifically URLAUTH, CATENATE, Lemonade Command Extensions in the 
   IMAP protocol [RFC 3501] and BURL in the SUBMIT protocol [RFC 2476]. 
 
   In addition, the Lemonade profile contains Lemonade Command 
   extensions for quick reconnect and media conversion.

   Lemonade provides enhancements to Internet email to support diverse 
   service environments.  
    
   This document describes the lemonade profile that includes: 
      - The Lemonade Pull Model that describes exchanges between 
        Lemonade Agents to allow clients to submit new email messages 
        incorporating content which resides on locations external to 
        the client and allow forward without download.

2.1. 
    Motivations 
    
   The advent of client/server email using the [RFC3501] and [RFC2821] 
   protocols has changed what formerly were local disk operations to 
   become excessive and repetitive network data transmissions. This is 
   an onerous burden for clients operating over low-bandwidth and/or 
   high-latency links. 
    
   The Lemonade Pull Model makes use of the [BURL] SUBMIT extension to 
   enable access to external sources during the submission of a message.  
   In combination with the IMAP [URLAUTH] extension, inclusion of 
   message parts or even entire messages from the IMAP mail store is 
   possible with a minimal trust relationship between the IMAP and 
   SUBMIT servers. 
    
   Pull has the distinct advantage of maintaining one submission 
   protocol, and thus avoids the risk of having multiple parallel and 
   possible divergent mechanisms for submission.  Furthermore, by 
   keeping the details of message submission in the SUBMIT server, the 
   Lemonade Pull Model can work with other message retrieval protocols 
   such as POP, NNTP, or whatever else may be designed in the future. 
    
2.2. 
    Message Sending Overview 
    
   The act of sending an email message is best thought of as involving 
   multiple steps: initiation of a new draft, draft editing, message 
   assembly, and message submission. 
    
   Initiation of a new draft and draft editing takes place on the MUA. 
   Frequently, users choose to save more complex and/or time-consuming 
   messages on an [RFC3501] server (via the APPEND command with the 
   \Draft flag) for later recall by the MUA and resumption of the 
   editing process. 
    
   Message assembly is the process of producing a complete message from 
   the final revision of the draft and external sources.  At assembly 
   time, external data is retrieved and inserted in the message. 
    
   Message submission is the process of inserting the assembled message 
   into the [RFC2821] infrastructure, typically using the [RFC2476] 
   protocol.

2.3. 
    Traditional Strategy 
    
   Traditionally, messages are initiated, edited, and assembled entirely 
   within an MUA, although drafts may be saved to an [RFC3501] server 
   and later retrieved from the server.  The completed text is then 
   transmitted to an MSA for delivery. 
    
   There is often no clear boundary between the editing and assembly 
   process.  If a message is forwarded, its content is often retrieved 
   immediately and inserted into the message text.  Similarly, once 
   external content is inserted or attached, the content is usually 
   retrieved immediately and made part of the draft. 
    
   As a consequence, each save of a draft and subsequent retrieve of the 
   draft transmits that entire (possibly large) content, as does message 
   submission. 
    
   In the past, this was not much of a problem, because drafts, external 
   data, and the message submission mechanism were typically located on 
   the same system as the MUA.  The most common problem was running out 
   of disk quota.

   The model distinguishes between a Messaging User Agent (MUA), an 
   IMAPv4Rev1 Server ([RFC3501]) and a submit server ([RFC2476]), as 
   illustrated in Figure 1.

                     Figure 1: Lemonade Pull Model 
             
    
   The Lemonade Pull Model allows a Messaging User Agent to compose and 
   forward an e-mail combining fragments that are located in an IMAP 
   server, without having to download these fragments to the server. 
    
   In the [BURL]/[CATENATE] variant of the pull strategy, messages are 
   initially composed and edited within an MUA.  The [CATENATE] 
   extension to [RFC3501] is then used to upload the message to the IMAP 
   server and assemble it, and finally a [URLAUTH] format URL is given 
   to a [RFC2476] server with the [BURL] extension for submission. 
 
   The flow involved to support such a use case consists of: 
      M: {to I -- Optional} The client connectects to the IMAP server 
     and IMAP Fetch of body structures and UIDs (See [RFC3501]) 
      
     Example: 
           M: A0051 FETCH 161 (UID BODYSTRUCTURE) 
           I: * 161 FETCH (UID 25627 BODYSTRUCTURE (("TEXT" "PLAIN" 
     ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL 
              NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" 
     "NAME" 
              "cc.diff") 
              "<960723163407.20117h@washington.example.net>" "Compiler 
     diff"

   The messaging user agent, mail server and submit server MUST support 
   IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501], CATENATE [CATENATE] and URLAUTH [URLAUTH]. 
 
2.5. 
    Additional Considerations 
    
   The so-called "pawn-ticket" authorization mechanism uses a URI which 
   contains its own authorization credentials using [URLAUTH].  The 
   advantage of this mechanism is that the submit [RFC2476] server can 
   not access any data on the [RFC3501] server without a "pawn-ticket" 
   created by the client.  The "pawn-ticket" grants acces only to the 
   specific data that the submit [RFC2476] server is authorized to 
   access, can be revoked by the client, and can have a time-limited 
   validity. 
    
2.6. 
    The fcc problem 
    
   The "fcc problem" refers to a frequent need to deliver a copy of the 
   message to a "file carbon copy" recipient.  By far, the most common 
   case of fcc is a client leaving a copy of outgoing mail in a "sent 
   messages" or "outbox" mailbox. 
    
   In the traditional strategy, the MUA duplicates the effort spent in 
   transmitting to the MSA by writing the message to the fcc destination 
   in a separate step.  This may be a write to a local disk file or an 
   APPEND to a mailbox on an IMAP server.  The latter is one of the 
   "excessive and repetitive network data transmissions" which 
   represents the "problem" aspect of the "fcc problem". 
    
   The [CATENATE] extension to [RFC3501] addresses the fcc problem.  It 
   requires making several simplifying assumptions:

       (1a) there is one, and only one, fcc destination on a single 
   server 
       (2a) the server which holds the fcc is the same as the server 
   which stages the outgoing message for submission 
       (3a) it is desired that the fcc be a copy of the complete message 
   text with all external data inserted in the message

    Quick Reconnect scheme 
    
   Mobile operators usually charge users for the time their mobile 
   client gets connected to the Internet and/or for the amount of 
   information sent/received. Thus a mobile client should minimize time 
   it stays connected to its mail server, which suggests that it should 
   disconnect and reconnect frequently. 
    
   Also, it is possible that the mobile client unexpectedly leaves area 
   of connectivity, which will require that the client reconnects when 
   connectivity returns. 
    
   << EditorÆs note: Discussion about voluntarily versa non-voluntarily 
   disconnects might go here>> 
    
   IMAP can be verbose. Usually, in order to synchronize a client with a 
   server after a disconnect, the client needs to issue at least the 
   following commands: LOGIN/AUTHENTICATE, SELECT and several FETCH 
   commands (see [IMAP-DISC] for more details). 
    
   Thus, there is a desire to have a quick reconnect facility in IMAP, 
   which will give a mobile client ability to resume a previously 
   abandoned session, without the need to perform the full 
   synchronization sequence as described above.

  Future work 
    
   Future versions of the Lemonade profile are expected to address 
   issues related to access of email form mobile devices, possibly 
   including: 
      - transport optimization for low or costly bandwidth and less 
        reliable mobile networks 
      - server to client notifications outside of the traditional IMAP 
        band 
      - dealing with firewall and intermediaries 
      - compression 
      - filtering  
    
Security Considerations 
    
   Security considerations on the Lemonade Pull Model are discussed 
   throughout section 2. 
    
   << EditorÆs note: TBD (Reconnect, etc.)>>
