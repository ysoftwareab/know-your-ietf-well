Abstract

   Entities responsible for distributing work across a group of systems
   traditionally do not know a great deal about the ability of the
   applications on those systems to complete the work in a satisfactory
   fashion.  Workload management systems traditionally know a great deal
   about the health of applications, but have little control over the
   rate in which these applications receive work.  The SASP protocol
   provides a mechanism for load balancers and workload management
   systems to communicate better ways of distributing the existing
   workload to the group members.

3.  Introduction

3.1.  Overview

   The Server/Application State Protocol is designed to enable Load
   Balancers or Schedulers to (1) receive traffic weight recommendations
   from Workload Managers and (2) to register with Workload Managers
   members of Load Balancing/Scheduling groups and (3) to enable
   Workload Managers to suggest new Load Balancing group members to Load
   Balancers and Schedulers

   The figure below shows where the SASP entities are in typical load
   balancing topology.

   Figure 1

   SASP is a binary protocol which facilitates communication from Load
   Balancers/Schedulers to Workload Managers.  The connection between
   the GWM and the Load Balancer/Scheduler is expected to be a long
   running TCP connection.  In SASP interactions, the GWM acts as a SASP
   server waiting to receive connections from the other SASP components.
   Server port 3860 has been registered with the IANA for SASP
   communications.  It is expected that all SASP components are
   configured with the DNS name of the GWM to develop this connection.
   Security in SASP is handled by transporting binary messages over SSL/
   TLS.  This document only describes the message format and protocol
   behavior above the connection and security layers.  Connection and

   security aspects including SSL's authentication and encryption will
   be implementation specific.

3.2.  Identities

   SASP identifies a load balancer by an UTF-8 string called a "LB UID".
   A group of "equivalent" servers providing a service is identified by
   an UTF-8 string called a "Group Name" which is interpreted in the
   context of the LB UID.  A server is identified by its IP address and
   (optional) port and protocol numbers.  A GWM is only identified
   implicitly as the entity on the other end of the TCP connection from
   a load balancer or group member.  All of these identifiers are local;
   there are no globally unique identifiers.  The LB UID and GroupName
   fields are unstructured so that components could assign values to
   these fields that are meaningful to an administrator.  For example,
   in many cases, a load balancer would use the name an administrator
   provided for the serverfarm group as the groupname in a SASP-
   specified group.  Since the naming options in industry load balancers
   do not carry explicit naming restrictions, SASP naming options also
   carry no naming restrictions.

4.  General Message Structure

   Any string interpreted by the group workload manager is assumed to
   use UTF8.  Components implementing SASP MUST support the printable
   ASCII subrepertoire of UTF8 (0x20-0x7E).  Components MAY also choose
   to provide support for additional UTF8 character encodings.  It is
   recommended that customers using SASP-enabled products configure the
   string-generating components (load balancers and group members) to
   use the same character repertoire.

   Many of the SASP structures involve the transfer of multi-byte
   integer values.  In all cases where multi-byte integer values are
   used, they are considered to be in network-byte order (big-endian).

   SASP is organized into several message components.  For extendibility
   and ease of processing, each message component is described in a TLV
   (Type, Length, Value) format.  An illustration of the SASP structure
   can be found in the example below.  The first section is the header
   followed by the message component type.  As mentioned, the header,
   message component, and all other components have a TLV format.  Each
   component value contains a variable number of fields, some of which
   refer to upcoming components (explained component descriptions are in
   upcoming sections).  After the first message component, any number of
   additional components may be included (as stipulated in the fields of
   the message type).

   An illustration of the TLV format is shown below.  The Type is a two
   byte field containing a binary value for the component type.  The
   Length is a two byte field containing the size of the TLV in bytes
   (including the Type and Length fields).  The Value field is a
   variable length field which actually contains the data of the
   component.

      message transaction that has no reply), this field serves no
      purpose.

4.4.  Version Negotiation

   To negotiate the version of the protocol used by the entities
   involved in the connection, the GWM views the version included in the
   Load Balancer request as the load balancer's proposed version.

   If the GWM supports the version proposed by the load balancer, it
   will respond to the connection with the appropriate response code and
   the load balancer's proposed version in the response header.  This
   proposed version should be the version used for all messages used in
   this connection.

   If the GWM does not support the version proposed by the load
   balancer, the GWM will respond with a "message not understood"
   response code and the GWM's highest supported SASP version in the
   version field of the response header.  This is an indication for the
   load balancer to come down to GWM's SASP version level.

5.  Singular Protocol Components

   The most basic of SASP components are singular components because
   they describe a single instance of a member, member resource, member
   weight, or group.  Some of the SASP components reuse other SASP
   components.  When this is the case, any component being reused by a
   base component will be simply given immediately following the base
   component.  Some examples of this technique are seen and explained in
   the Weight Entry and Member State Instance components.

5.1.  Member Data Component

      the Protocol Field of the IP header.  These are defined in
      [RFC1700]; however, a current list is maintained at
      http://www.iana.org.
      for example: TCP = 0x06, UDP = 0x11, etc.

      a system level member.  However, 0 shouldn't be perceived as a
      wildcard for either Port or Protocol fields (i.e. a deregistration
      request which includes a MemberData component with a 0 for the
      port doesn't mean deregister all applications listening on any
      port of that IP and protocol).

   o  IP Address: The current format is described by the following 16
      bytes, where IPv4 addresses are represented as "IPv4-compatible
      IPv6 addresses" [RFC3513].  In the following example, the x's and
      zeros represent 4 bit hex values.  The x's describe arbitrary hex
      values.

         IPv4 Address: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 xx xx xx xx

         IPv6 Address: xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx

   o  Label length: The length, in bytes, of the label string to follow.

   o  Label: A UTF8 string that may be set while registering a member.
      This string is opaque to the GWM and is simply included with any
      correspondence containing the member data component.  Note that
      the size of this label is <= 255 bytes.  Because UTF8 character
      encodings may be up to 6 bytes, care must be exercised by the load
      balancer or member to make sure the UTF8 string it sends the GWM
      is in fact <= 255 bytes.

5.2.  Group Data Component

   The group data component simply describes a group to associate other
   singular components with.

   o  LB UID: A UTF8 string used as a unique identifier and a context
      for the Group Name (e.g. a UTF8 representation of the MAC address
      of the Load Balancer or some type of UUID).  This string is used
      by the Group Workload Manager to associate application
      registration, deregistration, and set state messages with the
      correct load balancer.  This unique identifier should not be any
      longer than 64 bytes.

   o  Group Name Len: Length of the Group Name field to follow (in
      bytes).

   o  Group Name: A UTF8 string the load balancer has chosen to tell the
      Group Workload Manager that members being registered with this
      Group Name are equivalent in function.  In Get Weight and
      DeRegistration messages, the Group Name may be omitted (Group Name
      Length = 0) to indicate all groups from the associated load
      balancer.

5.3.  Weight Entry Data Component

   The Weight Entry Component is used by the get and send weight
   messages to associate a weight with a particular member (or Member
   Data).  It also uses an opaque member state field and a general
   member flags field to denote extra information about a member
   (described below).  When the Weight Entry component is used, the
   Member Data TLV it refers to is first listed, immediately followed by

   o  State Field: This field is used by the member to communicate state
      information to the scheduler.  The information placed in this
      field is opaque to the GWM and will simply be forwarded to the
      scheduler with the member weights.  There are no defined values
      for this field.

   o  Flags Field: This field has several flag values which describe
      several attributes of the member.

      A.  Contact Success Flag (set by the GWM): describes whether the
          member is currently running.  If the contact success flag is
          off, this member should be avoided by the load balancer.

          +  xxxx xxx1 The GWM has located this running system or
             application

          +  xxxx xxx0 The GWM has not located this running system or
             application

      B.  Quiesce Flag (set by the Load Balancer or Member): used when
          an administrator would like to temporarily remove a member
          from the weight calculation, but not deregister it from the
          group.  When quiesced, the member will still show up in the
          weights, but the quiesce flag will be set and its weight will
          be zero.  When the administrator returns this member to
          active, the quiesce flag will be 0 and a weight provided.  If
          the quiesce flag is on, this member should be avoided by the
          load balancer.

          +  xxxx xx1x The member is quiesced

          +  xxxx xx0x The member is active (not quiesced)

      C.  Registration Flag (set by the GWM): stores how the member was
          registered

          +  xxxx x1xx This Member has been registered by the Load
             Balancer/Scheduler

          +  xxxx x0xx This Member has registered itself

      D.  Confident Flag (set by the GWM): describes whether the GWM has
          knowledge of this member's state.  If this flag is off for
          only some of the members in the group while the remaining
          members have valid weights, the load balancer should avoid
          sending work to those members with the confident flag off.  If
          the confident flag is off for all valid group members, the
          load balancer should disregard any recommendation from the GWM
          until the confident flag comes back on for at least one
          member.  In this case where all confident flags are off, the
          load balancer should determine the correct distribution of
          work by other means (perhaps a different advisor, previously
          configured static weights, etc.).

          The goal of the confident flag is to convey to the load
          balancer that it should look to other methods of distribution
          recommendations if the GWM cannot give recommendations for any
          of the valid group members.  If some members of the group have
          the confident flag on but the contact flag off or the quiesced
          flag on (meaning these members should always be avoided) while
          the remaining members of the group have their confident flag
          off, the load balancer should determine the appropriate
          distribution of work for those members with the confident flag
          off by other means.

          +  xxxx 1xxx GWM has determined it has knowledge of the state
             of this member.

          +  xxxx 0xxx GWM has no knowledge of the state of this member.

      E.  Leftmost four bits are reserved 0000 xxxx - 1111 xxxx

   o  Weight: This field represents the GWM's recommendation for the
      relative amount of work that should be sent to this member.  This
      is a 16 bit field with a possible range of 0 to 65536.  Load
      balancers should be prepared to receive a wide range of weight
      values.  Load balancers with limited maximum weight values may

      restrict the granularity of management by the GWM and in turn
      cause less than optimal performance.  Many existing
      implementations have supported a minimum raw weight range from 0
      to 100.

5.4.  Member State Instance Component

   The Member State Instance Component is used by the set member state
   message to indicate the sender's perceived state of the member
   mentioned.  This component is used to set values that will ultimately
   end up in the WeightEntry component.  When the Member State Instance
   component is used, the Member Data TLV it refers to is first listed,
   immediately followed by the Member State Instance TLV.

   o  Flags Field: This field has describes attributes of the member.
      Currently the only flag value defined is that of the quiesce flag.
      The quiesce flag is used when an administrator would like to
      temporarily remove a member from the weight calculation, but not
      deregister it from the group.  When quiesced, the member will
      still show up in the weights, but the quiesce flag will be set and
      its weight will be zero.  When the administrator returns this
      member to active, the quiesce flag will be 0 and a weight

6.  Group Protocol Components

   Group protocol components each contain a collection of related
   singular components.  In particular, they associate Member Data,
   Weight Entry, or Member State Instance components to a particular
   Group Data component.  In these cases, the particular "Group of x"
   component will be immediately followed by the Group Data component.
   The Group Data component will be immediately followed by any number
   of singular components the group contains.  In figures listed in this
   document, a component type with an asterisk denotes a component that
   is repeated a number of times.

6.1.  Group of Member Data Component

   The "group of member data" component describes a particular group of
   members and is used in the registration message components.

7.  Protocol Messages

   SASP messages are a collection of TLVs (Type, Length, and Value
   components).  The header has no information as to what type of
   message it is part of; the purpose specific information is in the
   message component.  This format could facilitate placing more than
   one message component in a single message; however, this use of
   multiple message components is not supported in every GWM and could
   produce indeterminate behavior.  Similar to the other protocol
   components, when a message component needs to involve other
   components, the additional components immediately follow the message
   component.

   All SASP requests sent to the GWM will be acknowledged with a reply.
   The reply contains information requested as well as a single-byte
   response code describing the success of the request.  SASP defines
   some general response codes in the range of 0x00 - 0x3F that may be
   used regardless of the response message type.  However, some request
   types may cause specific error conditions not covered by the general
   response codes.  The response code range of 0x40 - 0xFF is used for
   these message-specific response codes.  Any given SASP response will
   only contain one response code (depending on the error type).  This
   section explains the format and purpose of specific SASP messages.

7.1.  Registration Request and Reply

   This exchange happens between the load balancer/scheduler and the
   Group Workload Manager as well as between the Group Workload Manager
   and the Member to register the members in a group specified by Group
   Name.  Applications are identified with an IP address, Protocol, and
   Port.  Systems are identified only with an IP Address (Port = 0x0000
   and Protocol = 0x00).  All members in a group have equivalent
   functionality so the Group Workload Manager can direct routers, load
   balancers and schedulers to any member in the group.  Even though
   registrations can come from either the load balancer/scheduler or the
   actual member, member-initiated registrations will only be considered
   if the Trust flag is set while setting the state of the load
   balancer/scheduler.

   example, some GWM vendors may not support the registration of both
   System and Application members in the same group.  To determine what

7.2.  DeRegistration Request and Reply

   This exchange happens between the load balancer/scheduler and the
   Group Workload Manager as well as between the Group Workload Manager

   Name with the Group Workload Manager.  All members in a group have
   equivalent functionality so the Group Workload Manager can direct
   routers, load balancers and schedulers to any member in the group.
   Even though deregistrations can come from either the load balancer/

   only be considered if the Trust flag is set while setting the state
   of the load balancer/scheduler.

   (balancing workloads between applications with the same
   functionality), the Load Balancer would call the Group Workload
   Manager every Interval (parameter returned by the Group Workload
   Manager below) to get an array of weights and associated members
   (e.g.  Application1 20, SecondCopyOfApplication 30,
   ThirdCopyOfApplication 5).  The load balancer then uses these weights
   to determine the fashion in which work will be sent to each of the
   members.  For example, in the case of weighted round robin, the Load
   Balancer/Scheduler would then send a request to Application1, the
   next to SecondCopyOfApplication and the next to
   ThirdCopyOfApplication.  After 15 requests, the load balancer/
   scheduler would only send work to Application1 and
   SecondCopyOfApplication.  After an additional 30 requests, the load
   balancer/Scheduler would only send requests to
   SecondCopyofApplication.  After another 10 requests, the load
   balancer/Scheduler product would start over using the weights of 20,
   30 or 5 again, or if the Interval number of seconds have passed, get
   a new set of weights.

      present, the second "Group of Weight Data" component only appears

7.4.  Send Weights

   This exchange happens between the Group Workload Manager and the load
   balancer/scheduler to send the new weights for the group specified in
   Group Name.  This message is unique in that it is the only message
   exchange initiated by the Group Workload Manager and the only message
   that has no reply.  In the case of Application load balancing
   (balancing workloads between applications with the same
   functionality), the Group Workload Manager would message the Load
   Balancer at a possibly dynamic interval (chosen by the Group Workload
   Manager) to send an array of weights and associated members (e.g.
   Application1 20, SecondCopyOfApplication 30, ThirdCopyOfApplication
   5).  The load balancer then uses these weights to determine the
   fashion in which work will be sent to each of the members.  For
   example, in the case of weighted round robin, the load balancer/
   Scheduler would then send a request to Application1, the next to
   SecondCopyOfApplication and the next to ThirdCopyOfApplication.
   After 15 requests, the load balancer/scheduler would only send work
   to Application1 and SecondCopyOfApplication.  After another 30
   requests, the load balancer/Scheduler would only send requests to
   SecondCopyofApplication.  After an additional 10 requests, the load
   balancer/Scheduler product would start over using the weights of 20,
   30 or 5 again, if it has not yet received a new set of weights.  The
   Group Workload Manager only sends this message if the Push flag has
   been enabled using a Set Load Balancer State message.

7.5.  Set Member State Request and Reply

   This is a special exchange that can take place between the load
   balancer and the Group Workload Manager or between the Member and the
   Group Workload Manager to pass information about the state of the
   member including placing the member in quiesced or non-quiesced
   states.  In particular, the load balancer/scheduler can use this
   message to quiesce a set of members.  Members can also use this
   message to quiesce themselves as well as passing certain state
   information to the load balancer/scheduler that is opaque to the
   Group Workload Manager.  This opaque state information is passed to
   the load balancer/scheduler with the weights during get and send
   weight messages.

      A.  Push Flag

          +  xxxx xxx1 The Load Balancer should receive weights through
             the Send Weights message (GWM pushes weights to Load
             Balancer).  Even if this flag is set, the GWM must still
             respond accordingly to any Get Weights messages from the
             Load Balancer.

          +  xxxx xxx0 The Load Balancer will send a Get Weights message
             to get the new weights.  This is the default behavior.
             (Load Balancer pulls weights from GWM).

      B.  Trust Flag

          +  xxxx xx1x Trust any member-initiated registration,
             deregistration, or set state message.  Immediately reflect
             the registration, deregistration, or new state in the
             weights sent.

             Deregistration, and State Setting of members can only occur
             from the Load Balancer.  Discard any member-initiated
             registration, deregistration, or set state message.  This
             is the default behavior.

      C.  No Change / No Send Flag

          +  xxxx x1xx The GWM must not include members whose weights
             and state (i.e. contact and quiesce flags) have not changed
             since they were last sent.

          +  xxxx x0xx The GWM must include the weights of all group
             members when sending the weights to this load balancer
             (including members whose weights and state have not
             changed).  This is the default behavior.

8.  Example of SASP Message Encoding

   This section is to provide an example of the actual SASP message
   encoding.  For this example, we will look at a sample GetWeights
   Reply in which two webservers are registered to a serverfarm called
   FARM1.  The IP addresses of the two webservers are 10.10.10.1 and
   10.10.10.2.  Currently the GWM has a weight of 40 for 10.10.10.1 and
   20 for 10.10.10.2.  The Load Balancer has a unique Identifier of
   "LB1" and the message example was sent by the GWM in response to a
   request (MessageID: 0x32000000) for FARM1's weights.

   The TLVs necessary for this message are shown in the following list.

   1.  SASP Header TLV

9.  Protocol Flow

   This section describes the expected general flow of the SASP
   messages.

9.1.  Normal Protocol Flow

   SASP first starts with a connection from a LB to the GWM.  This is
   expected to be a long running connection, and will be used for many
   messages.  After establishing the connection, the LB either registers
   a group of members or sets a Trust flag to allow the members to
   register themselves.  The Trust flag is set using a Set LB State
   Request (both message flows are shown below).


   Registration from Load Balancer

   ------------  Registration Request  ------------------
   |          |----------------------->|                |
   |   Load   |                        | Group Workload |
   | Balancer |  Registration Reply    |     Manager    |
   |          |<-----------------------|                |
   ------------                        ------------------

   Set LB State from Load Balancer

   ------------  Set LB State Request  ------------------
   |          |----------------------->|                |
   |   Load   |                        | Group Workload |
   | Balancer |  Set LB State Reply    |     Manager    |
   |          |<-----------------------|                |
   ------------                        ------------------

   Figure 31

   The connection can start with other requests, but any other request
   would likely result in an error (unless this connection is a
   reconnection that has happened a short period of time after the
   original connection).  For example, if the load balancer issues a
   deregistration request as its first message, it will receive an error
   because it has not registered any groups.

   The load balancer always drops all state information after a loss of
   connection and can recover it using a GetWeights message.  The
   establishment of a new connection causes the GWM to assume that the
   old one is broken.  In this case, the GWM will keep all state for the
   load balancer for a limited time after a detected break.  After the
   limited time has expired, all state for the broken connection will be

   discarded by the GWM.

   Registration of group members may be done at any time.  A load
   balancer can register anywhere from one group with one member to many
   groups of many members.  The member may also register itself if the
   Trust flag has been set and it knows the appropriate load balancer
   information.  Registrations will add to groups that already exist,
   but return errors if any of the registered members already exist.

   In the case of System Load Balancing, the representation of a member
   is only the member's IP address with a 0 used as the value for the
   port and protocol.  In the case of Application Load Balancing, the
   representation of a member is the member's IP address and the
   Application's port and protocol.

   Deregistration of group members may be done at any time.  A load
   balancer can deregister anywhere from one group with one member to
   many groups of many members.  The LB may also deregister entire
   groups or deregister all of its groups at once.  The member may also
   deregister itself if the Trust flag has been set and it knows the
   appropriate load balancer information.

   Once members are registered, the GWM will start the monitoring and
   weight computation processes to determine weights to be sent back to
   the load balancer.  At any time the load balancer may issue a
   GetWeights message and ask for the weights for members in a
   particular group.  The LB may also set a flag telling the GWM to send
   the weights without waiting for the GetWeights message.  If this flag
   is set, the GWM will send the weights at an interval it feels is
   appropriate (the interval could change depending on the algorithm
   used and variance of the weights generated).

   At any time the LB or a particular member may quiesce the member
   through the use of a SetMemberState message.  In this case, the
   member's weight will always be zero and the quiesce turned on when
   sending its weight.  Members may also use this message to send an
   opaque state value which will also be presented when sending weights.

   At any time the load balancer may choose to send the GWM a SetLBState
   request to configure its interaction.  The message allows the load
   balancer to set the Push, Trust, and NoChange_NoSend flags.  It also
   allows the load balancer to pass a health value to the GWM to be
   displayed.

9.2.  Behavior in Error Cases

   While behaviors in many error conditions will be product specific,
   the following error cases should have the following expected

   behavior.


   Case: The protocol is violated in an unrecoverable manner by either
      end of the connection.

   Behavior: Either end of the connection may choose to disconnect to
      avoid future message synchronization problems.  The state kept
      when disconnected is vendor specific.


   Case: LB or application attempts to connect to the GWM before the GWM
      is fully up and running.

   Behavior: The LB or application should wait at least 20 seconds to
      retry the connection.


   Case: Members attempt to register or deregister themselves before the
      LB develops the connection with the GWM.

   Behavior: In this case, the members would receive a reply with an
      error code signifying that there is no LB registered with that LB
      UID.


   Case: Member registers or deregisters for a LB who has not set the
      Trust flag.

   Behavior: GWM will send Member a reply containing an error code.


   Case: LB asks for weights for a group that doesn't exist.

   Behavior: GWM will send LB a reply containing an error code.


   Case: LB or Member attempts to register a member that is already
      registered in that group.

   Behavior: GWM will send sender a reply containing an error code.


   Case: LB or Member attempts to deregister a member or group that
      doesn't exist.

9.5.  Avoiding Single Points of Failure

   o  To avoid having a single point of failure at the load balancer, an
      administrator may choose to have multiple load balancers in his or
      her environment.  SASP provides for the GWM to keep track of
      multiple load balancers through the use of load balancer unique
      identifiers (LB UIDs).

   o  To avoid having a single point of failure at the GWM or enhance
      the load balancing strategy by utilizing the strengths of several
      different GWMs, an administrator may choose to have multiple GWMs
      in his or her environment.  In this case, the load balancer would
      connect to multiple GWMs and register the same groups with
      corresponding members.  The load balancer may choose to coordinate
      the recommendations of each GWM by any method it chooses (i.e.
      statistical combination such as averaging, etc).  The coordination
      of weights from multiple GWMs is product specific and not
      addressed in this protocol.

10.  Security Considerations

   SASP is a binary stream expected to be transported over a TCP
   connection.  To secure this protocol, it is expected that
   implementers of the protocol use a secure mode of transport such as
   SSL/TLS.  Discussions around security concerns have been listed
   below:


   Security Issue: In insecure environments, if the LB UID becomes known
      by another system, the other system could initiate a connection
      and send messages to the GWM causing the GWM to replace the
      previous (possibly valid) connection for the new (potentially bad)
      connection.

   Solution: This may not be a concern if the load balancer and GWM are
      in protected parts of the network.  If the administrator is
      concerned about this vulnerability, she should use SSL or TLS to
      provide authentication for the connection.  When using SSL or TLS
      to secure the connection, the administrator SHOULD use both server
      and client authentication through client and server certificates.
      The GWM will trust any certificate that is signed by an authority
      it's been configured to trust.


   Security Issue: In insecure environments, if the load balancer turns
      the Trust Flag on, any member or other system can send a
      Registration Message and be included in the serverfarm to receive
      work.  A person with bad intentions and the correct information
      could exploit this feature and register his own application to
      receive work.  His counterfeit application could capture valuable
      data from unsuspecting clients as their transactions are sent to
      his system.

   Solution: This may not be a concern if the GWM and its members are in
      protected parts of the network.  If the administrator is concerned
      about this vulnerability, she should use SSL or TLS to provide
      authentication for the member connections.  When using SSL or TLS
      to authenticate the connection, the administrator would need to
      explicitly install valid certificates on each component while at
      the same time establishing the trusted certificates of each
      component.  This would make certain that only those trusted
      components would be permitted to connect to the GWM.
