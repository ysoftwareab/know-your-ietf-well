                          Stretching DNS TTLs
                 draft-wkumari-dnsop-ttl-stretching-00

Abstract

   The TTL of a DNS Resource Record expresses how long a record may be
   cached before it should be discarded.  This document discusses the
   possibility of "stretching TTLS" (using them past their expiration)
   if they cannot be refreshed.  This works on the assumption that stale
   data may be better than no data.

   PLEASE NOTE: This document is a strawman to drive discussion.  It may
   or may not be a good idea; this document documents the idea so that
   there is something concrete to throw tomatoes at.

   [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background

1.  Introduction

   DNS Resource Records (RR) have an associated TTL.  This is how long
   the record may be cached before it should be expired and new
   information fetched.  This is based upon the assumption that the
   authoritative servers will be reachable when they are needed, and
   that records expire and are immediately evicted from the cache.

   There are a number of reasons why an authoritative server may become
   unreachable, including, unfortunately, Denial of Service (DoS)
   attacks.  Recent proposals, for example "Highly Automated Method for
   Maintaining Expiring Records" ([I-D.wkumari-dnsop-hammer]) propose
   refreshing records in the cache before they expire and are evicted.
   This means that the recursive server still has information in its
   cache when it attempts to contact the authoritative server.

   This document suggests that, if the recursive server is unable to
   contact the authoritative server, it simply extends the existing

   records TTL, on the assumption that "stale bread if better than no
   bread".

   [Ed: This is the primary point of the document / question -- if you
   cannot reach the authoritative nameservers (perhaps they being DoS-
   ed, perhaps they were unplugged, you cannot really tell) it is better
   to use the last known (and perhaps outdated) information, or is it
   better for the domain to go dark?  I think the former, but this is a
   significant change to the meaning / semantics of TTLs).

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Proposal

   If a recursive nameserver is unable to contact any of the
   authoritative nameservers for a zone, and it still has the resource
   record cached, it MAY "stretch" the TTL by simply increasing it it by
   the original TTL.  It may do this N times, where N should be
   configurable.

   [ Ed: I was going to say "by doubling the TTL", but then if we allow
   implementations to do this e.g 3 times, is that 4 times the original
   TTL, or is it 2^3 the original TTL].
