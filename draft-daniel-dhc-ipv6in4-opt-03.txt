  Abstract 
      
     This document provides a mechanism by which the DHCPv4 servers can     
     provide information about the configured IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel     
     end-point.  The IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack nodes can use this     
     information to set up a configured tunnel to the tunnel end-point     
     to obtain IPv6 connectivity.

  1. Introduction 
      
     In the initial deployment of IPv6, the IPv6 nodes may need to     
     communicate with the other IPv6 nodes via IPv4 tunnel service. The 
     connectivity can be obtained by setting up an IPv6-over-IPv4 
     configured tunnel between a client and a tunnel router.   
      
     This document defines a new option by which the DHCPv4 [RFC-2131] 
     server can notify the client with the list of end-points of the 
     possible configured tunnels. 
      
     Particularly, this mechanism is useful where the ISP is providing 
     the IPv6 services but is doing it using tunneling over IPv4 to avoid 
     upgrading all their infrastructure to support IPv6 on day one. 
      
     Regarding IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel, the tunnel broker [RFC-3053] 
     architecture has been widely deployed in the dual networks to obtain 
     IPv6 connectivity via tunnel service because of easy configuration 
     on the users.  After configuring IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel between the 
     users and the selected tunnel server, tunnel broker allows user to 
     get access to the 6bone or any other IPv6 network the tunnel server 
     is connected to.  In case of no tunnel broker, the proposed 
     mechanism in this document can allow users to obtain the IPv6 
     connectivity efficiently.

  Internet Draft       CTEP Option for IP6over4 Tunnel   April 19, 2004 
   
   
   
     The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,      
     SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this      
     document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC-2119]. 
      
      
  3. Configured Tunnel End Point Option 
      
     This option specifies the configured tunnel end-point that client      
     should use when discovering the IPv4 address of the ISP's tunnel      
     router somehow via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. 
      
     Once the IPv4 address has been learned, it is configured as the      
     tunnel end-point for the configured IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel. 
      
     The format of the Configured Tunnel End Point Option is shown as      
     below;  
      
     The code for this option is TBD.  The length of this option is 4. 
            
          Code            Length             CTEP Order in Sequence 
      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |  OPTION_CTEP  |     Len       |           CTEP Addr           | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |        CTEP Addr              | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
      
     In the above diagram, CTEP Addr is 32-bit integers corresponding to 
     DHCP options which specify the IP address of different configured 
     tunnel end-point. 
      
     As described in [RFC-2893], the dual node received CTEP option MUST 
     store the tunnel end-point address and this address is used as 
     destination address for the encapsulating IPv4 header. 
      
     The determination of which packets to tunnel is usually made by   
     routing information on the encapsulator.  This is usually done via a   
     routing table, which directs packets based on their destination   
     address using the prefix mask and match technique.  For more 
     information, refer to section 4. Configured Tunneling in [RFC-2893]. 
      
      
  4. Multiple Tunnel End Point Considerations 
      


  Park, Kim                Expires: October, 20 2004            [Page 3] 
   
  Internet Draft       CTEP Option for IP6over4 Tunnel   April 19, 2004 
   
   
   
     For the simple configured tunnel, one tunnel end-point is generally 
     used and it assumes that all the networks will be reached through 
     the same end-point.  In this case, one CTEP Addr field in the CTEP 
     option is used for configured tunnel service. 
      
     The list of end-points can be installed as the default routes and 
     the routes will be tried in a round robin fashion if the IPv6 host 
     load-sharing is honored [IPv6LOAD].  Instead there can be specific 
     default routes for the different destination.  
      
     Generally, there may not be a need for installing multiple 
     configured tunnel end-points unless administrator wants two for 
     redundancy purposes.  It is out of scope of this draft. 
      
      
  5. Security Considerations 
      
     A rouge DHCP server can issue invalid or incorrect configured tunnel      
     end-point.  This may cause denial of service due to unreachability     
     or makes the client to reach incorrect destination. 
      
     The latter has very severe security issues as the tunnel end-point      
     is on-the-path towards all the IPv6 destinations, and can trivially      
     act as a man-in-the-middle attacker. 
      
     To increase secure exchange between users and tunnel end-points, the 
     tunnel broker or any tunnel agent can be used for configuring IPv6-
     over-IPv4 tunnels including authentication, security association and 
     so on, but it is not scope of this document.  
      
     The authenticated DHCP [RFC-3118] can be also used for secure 
     exchange between users and tunnel end-points (routers). 
      
      
  6. Extended Usage 
      
     As stated in Introduction, the tunnel broker is a nice tool for 
     allowing user to get the IPv6 connectivity through IPv6-over-IPv4 
     tunnel.  To configure tunnel between users and tunnel servers, users 
     have to access to the tunnel broker by web registration and then 
     tunnel broker set up tunnel between users and a selected tunnel 
     server.  Prior to filling up the form on the tunnel broker, users 
     have to know the IPv4 address of the tunnel broker (as described in 
     [6], it may be IPv6 addressable but not mandatory).  Regarding this 
     operation, this option proposed in this document can allow users to 



  Park, Kim                Expires: October, 20 2004            [Page 4] 
   
  Internet Draft       CTEP Option for IP6over4 Tunnel   April 19, 2004 
   
   
   
     obtain an available tunnel broker address (or addresses) without any 
     manual operations. 
      
     For this operation, a new option (called Tunnel Broker Configuration 
     Option: option name is OPTION_TBCO and value is TBD) can be simply 
     made by DHCPv4 option extension which may be the same format as CTEP 
     option. 
      
     To increase secure exchange between users and tunnel end-points 
     (tunnel servers or dual routers) this extended usage can be applied 
     for configuring IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel instead of direct tunnel 
     configuration between them.  Specific method for secure exchange is 
     beyond scope of this document. 
      
      
  7. IANA Considerations 
      
     IANA is requested to an assign value for the Configured Tunnel End 
     Point option code in accordance with RFC 2939 [RFC-2939]. 
      
     Option Name        Value     Described in 
     OPTION_CTEP         TBD        Section 3.
