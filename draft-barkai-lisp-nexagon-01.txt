1.  Introduction

  (1) The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) [RFC6830] splits current IP
  addresses in two different namespaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and
  Routing Locators (RLOCs). LISP uses a map-and-encap approach that relies on
  (1) a Mapping System (distributed database) that stores and disseminates
  EID-RLOC mappings and on (2) LISP tunnel routers (xTRs) that encapsulate
  and decapsulate data packets based on the content of those mappings.

  (2) H3 is a geospatial indexing system using a hexagonal grid that can be
  (approximately) subdivided into finer and finer hexagonal grids,
  combining the benefits of a hexagonal grid with hierarchical subdivisions.
  H3 supports sixteen resolutions. Each finer resolution has cells with one
  seventh the area of the coarser resolution. Hexagons cannot be perfectly
  subdivided into seven hexagons, so the finer cells are only approximately
  contained within a parent cell. Each cell is identified by a 64bit int.

  (3) The Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) Industry Consortium investigates state-of-
  the-art technologies in computer vision and machine learning for automotive
  applications, BDD based taxonomy of published automotive scene classification.

  These standards are combined to create in-network key-value state-blackboard -
  reflecting the state of each 1sqm hexagon tile of each road. The lisp network
  maps traffic form vehicle endpoint IP identifiers (EID) to routing location
  (RLOC) of H3 server EID-ed hexagon identifier (HID).

  Th lisp network blackboard bridges timing-location gaps of vision & sensory
  (publishers) - and - driving apps/smart-infrastructure (subscribers).
  Drivers (EID) communicate with blackboard tiles (HID), EID<=> RLOC <=> HID,
  small tiles to publish, large tiles to subscribe to regional information.

  One of of the key use-cases is providing drivers with 20-30 seconds preemptive
  heads-up on potential hazards and obstacles beyond line of site: over traffic,
  around blocks, beyond turns and curvatures.

  (1) LISP blackboard keys are 64bit H3 IDs referring to ~1sqm H3 level 15
  (2) LISP blackboard values are 64bit compiled-states of each H3 road-tile
  (3) LISP blackboard pub-sub regions are at H3 level-12 containing l15 tiles
  (4) LISP Blackboard is sharded to scale state-updates and edge propagation
  (5) Edge XTRs use the H3 IDs to map traffic to and from H3Servers
  (6) Edge XTRs are also used to replicate bulk state multicast to clients
  (7) Bulk updates multicast-replication can use native ran-access multicast

4. H3LISP Clients-Network-Servers

  In order to overlay the mobility network across:
   - multiple access-network providers / radio-access technologies
   - multiple cloud-edge hosting providers both public and private
  We use signal-free XTRs in the stack of each mobility client and server.
  stack XTRs are homed to one or more RTRs at the cloud or network edge.

  This structure allows for each mobility client to "show-up" at any time,
  behind any network or cloud provider in a given mobility administrative
  domain, and still be able to communicate un-interrupted with the mobility
  network clients and servers.

  There are two options for how we associate StackXTRs with EdgeRTRs:

  I. semi-random based on rough administrative DNS based load-balanced partition
  II. geo-spatial, where a well known any-cast RTR aggregates each H3.r9 hexagon

  To summarize the H3LISP mobility network layout:

   (1) Mobility-Clients' stack tunneled via signal-free XTR interface
       Clients stack-XTRs multi-homed to Edge RTRs
   (2) H3Server stack is tunneled using signal-free XTR Interface
       Server stack-XTRs are multi-homed to Edge RTRs
   (3) Edge RTRs use mapping service to resolve H3-IP to RTR RLOCs
       This allows H3LISP end-points to roam between providers in a domain.



                  Clients <> StackXTR <Network Provider > EdgeRTR
                                          ||
                      < Map-Assisted Mobility-Network Overlay>
                                          ||
                     EdgeRTR <Cloud Provider> StackXTR<>Servers


5. H3LISP Clients-Servers Unicast

  Which ever way a stack XTR is homed to an Edge RTR, via DNS metro load-balance
  or via a well known  geo-spatial map of VIPs (a few 10Ks per large metro area),
  an authenticated, authorized client EID can send a 64bitH3.res15::64bitState
  annotation to the H3.res9 EID server. The H3.res9 IP EID can be calculated by
  the client algorithmically form the H3.res15 localized tile ID.

  The Stack XTR encapsulates the mobility client EID and the H3Server EID in a
  packet sourced from the XTR network provider IP stack port, destined to the
  EdgeRTR RLOC IP, Lisp port. Edge RTRs then re-encapsulate annotation packets
  either to remote RTR (optionI) or to homed H3Server StackXTR (option2).
  In option1 only the remote Edge RTR aggregating H3Servers re-encapsulates
  CellEID, ClientEID, tileID, TileState packet to server stack XTR.

  To Summarize:

   (1) Mobility Clients can send annotation state localized an H3.r15 tile
       These annotations are sent to an H3.res9 mobility server
   (2) Source Client EID and Dest H3 EID are encapsulated XTR <> RTR
       * RTRs can map-resolve re-tunnel H3 EID to remote RTR RLOC
   (3) RTRs re-encapsulate original source-dest to stack XTRs
       Stack XTRs decapsulate packet and serve the original EIDs packet




6. H3LISP Servers-Clients Multicast

  Each H3.res9 Mobility Server used by clients to update H3.res15 tile state,
  is also an IP Multicast channel used to update subscribers on the aggregate
  state of the tiles in the cell.

  We can use rfc8378 signal free multicast to implement cell channels in the
  overlay. Since the mobility network has many channels and relatively few
  subscribers per each connected through natural RTR fan-out this multicast
  method is both simple and effective. Clients driving to or subscribing to a
  geo-cell issue an IGMP report in-order to subscribe. IGMP messages are
  encapsulated between the stack XTR and the Edge RTR, therefore no need for the
  underlying network to support native multicast.

  Edge RTRs note the subscribed client stack XTRs and if need be register them
  selves as channel subscribers in the mapping system. This is done at the
  first subscription request, if additional clients homed to the same RTR
  register for the same channels.

  Upon receiving a multicast packet the Edge RTR homing H3.res9 Servers resolve
  the remote RTR registered for the channel and replicate the packet to them.
` The remote RTRs homing clients in-turn replicate the packet to the registered
  homed clients.We expect an average of 600 H3.res15 tiles of the full 10K
  to be part of any road. The H3.res9 server can transmit the status of all
  600 or just those with meaningful state based on policy. As long as the
  refresh rate and update latency matches that of the registered clients SLA.

   Summary:

   (1) H3LISP Clients tune to H3 mobility updates using rfc8378
       H3LISP Client issue IGMP-Report registration to H3 multicast EIDs
       Stack XTRs encapsulate IGMP-report to Edge RTRs who register the EID

       *H3LISP Servers send periodic mobility update packet through stack XTR
       based on channel SLA

   (2) Stack XTRs encapsulate to Edge RTRs who map-resolve registered RLOCs
       Edge RTRs replicate mobility update and tunnel to registered RTRs
       Remote Edge RTRs replicate updates to registered Clients through XTRs



7.  Security Considerations

   The way to provide a security association between the ITRs and the
   Map-Servers must be evaluated according to the size of the
   deployment.  For small deployments, it is possible to have a shared
   key (or set of keys) between the ITRs and the Map-Servers.  For
   larger and Internet-scale deployments, scalability is a concern and
   further study is needed.
