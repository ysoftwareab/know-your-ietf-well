1. Introduction 

   [ISIS-TE] defines extensions to the ISIS protocol [ISIS] to support 
   intra-area Traffic Engineering (TE). The extensions provide a way of

   encoding the TE information for TE-enabled links within the network 
   (TE links) and flooding this information within an area. The 
   Extended IS Reachability TLV and Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV, 
   which are defined in [ISIS-TE], are used to carry such TE 
   information. The Extended IS Reachability TLV has several nested 
   sub-TLVs which describe the TE attributes for a TE link.  

   [ISIS-TE-V3] and [GMPLS-TE] define similar extensions to ISIS [ISIS] 
   in support of IPv6 and GMPLS traffic engineering respectively. 

   Requirements for establishing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) 
   TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that cross multiple Autonomous 
   Systems (ASes) are described in [INTER-AS-TE-REQ]. As described in 
   [INTER-AS-TE-REQ], a method SHOULD provide the ability to compute a 
   path spanning multiple ASes. So a path computation entity that may 
   be the head-end Label Switching Router (LSR), an AS Border Router 
   (ASBR), or a Path Computation Element (PCE [PCE]) needs to know the 
   TE information not only of the links within an AS, but also of the 
   links that connect to other ASes. 

   In this document, a new TLV, which is referred to as the Inter-AS 
   Reachability TLV, is defined to advertise inter-AS TE information, 
   three new sub-TLVs are defined for inclusion in the Inter-AS 
   Reachability TLV to carry the information about the remote AS number 
   and remote ASBR ID. The sub-TLVs defined in [ISIS-TE], [ISIS-TE-V3] 
   and other documents for inclusion in the Extended IS Reachability 
   TLV for describing the TE properties of a TE link are applicable to 
   be included in the Inter-AS Reachability TLV for describing the TE 
   properties of an inter-AS TE link as well. And two more new sub-TLVs 
   are defined for inclusion in the IS-IS Router Capability TLV to 
   carry the TE Router ID when TE Router ID needs to reach all routers 
   within an entire ISIS routing domain. The extensions are equally 
   applicable to IPv4 and IPv6 as identical extensions to [ISIS-TE] and 
   [ISIS-TE-V3]. The detailed definitions and procedures are discussed 
   in the following sections. 

   This document does not propose or define any mechanisms to advertise 
   any other extra-AS TE information within ISIS. See Section 2.1 for a 
   full list of non-objectives for this work. 

2. Problem Statement 

   As described in [INTER-AS-TE-REQ], in the case of establishing an 
   inter-AS TE LSP traversing multiple ASes, the Path message [RFC3209] 
   may include the following elements in the Explicit Route Object (ERO) 
   in order to describe the path of the LSP:

     - a set of AS numbers as loose hops; and/or 

     - a set of LSRs including ASBRs as loose hops. 

   Two methods for determining inter-AS paths are currently being 
   discussed. The per-domain method [PD-PATH] determines the path one 
   domain at a time. The backward recursive method [BRPC] uses 
   cooperation between PCEs to determine an optimum inter-domain path. 
   The sections that follow examine how inter-AS TE link information 
   could be useful in both cases. 

2.1. A Note on Non-Objectives 

   It is important to note that this document does not make any change 
   to the confidentiality and scaling assumptions surrounding the use 
   of ASes in the Internet. In particular, this document is conformant 
   to the requirements set out in [INTER-AS-TE-REQ]. 

   The following features are explicitly excluded: 

     o There is no attempt to distribute TE information from within one 
        AS to another AS. 

     o There is no mechanism proposed to distribute any form of TE 
        reachability information for destinations outside the AS. 

     o There is no proposed change to the PCE architecture or usage. 

     o TE aggregation is not supported or recommended. 

     o There is no exchange of private information between ASes. 

     o No ISIS adjacencies are formed on the inter-AS link. 

2.2. Per-Domain Path Determination 

   In the per-domain method of determining an inter-AS path for an 
   MPLS-TE LSP, when an LSR that is an entry-point to an AS receives a 
   Path message from an upstream AS with an ERO containing a next hop 
   that is an AS number, it needs to find which LSRs (ASBRs) within the 
   local AS are connected to the downstream AS so that it can compute a 
   TE LSP segment across the local AS to one of those LSRs and forward 
   the Path message to it and hence into the next AS. See Figure 1 for 
   an example:

                  Figure 1: Inter-AS Reference Model 

   The figure shows three ASes (AS1, AS2, and AS3) and twelve LSRs (R1 
   through R12). R3 and R4 are ASBRs in AS1. R5, R6, R7, and R8 are 
   ASBRs in AS2. R9 and R10 are ASBRs in AS3. 

   If an inter-AS TE LSP is planned to be established from R1 to R12, 
   the AS sequence will be: AS1, AS2, AS3. 

   Suppose that the Path message enters AS2 from R3. The next hop in 
   the ERO shows AS3, and R5 must determine a path segment across AS2 
   to reach AS3. It has a choice of three exit points from AS2 (R6, R7, 
   and R8) and it needs to know which of these provide TE connectivity 
   to AS3, and whether the TE connectivity (for example, available 
   bandwidth) is adequate for the requested LSP. 

   Alternatively, if the next hop in the ERO is the entry ASBR for AS3 
   (say R9), R5 needs to know which of its exit ASBRs has a TE link 
   that connects to R9. Since there may be multiple ASBRs that are 
   connected to R9 (both R7 and R8 in this example), R5 also needs to 
   know the TE properties of the inter-AS TE links so that it can 
   select the correct exit ASBR. 

   Once the path message reaches the exit ASBR, any choice of inter-AS 
   TE link can be made by the ASBR if not already made by entry ASBR 
   that computed the segment. 

   More details can be found in the Section 4. of [PD-PATH], which 
   clearly points out why advertising of inter-AS links is desired. 

   To enable R5 to make the correct choice of exit ASBR the following 
   information is needed: 

     o List of all inter-AS TE links for the local AS. 

     o TE properties of each inter-AS TE link. 



 
 
Chen, et al.          Expires February 25, 2009               [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft     ISIS extensions for Inter-AS TE         August 2008 
    

     o AS number of the neighboring AS connected to by each inter-AS TE 
        link. 

     o Identity (TE Router ID) of the neighboring ASBR connected to by 
        each inter-AS TE link. 

   In GMPLS networks further information may also be required to select 
   the correct TE links as defined in [GMPLS-TE]. 

   The example above shows how this information is needed at the entry 
   point ASBRs for each AS (or the PCEs that provide computation 
   services for the ASBRs), but this information is also needed 
   throughout the local AS if path computation function is fully 
   distributed among LSRs in the local AS, for example to support LSPs 
   that have start points (ingress nodes) within the AS.  

2.3. Backward Recursive Path Computation 

   Another scenario using PCE techniques has the same problem. [BRPC] 
   defines a PCE-based TE LSP computation method (called Backward 
   Recursive Path Computation) to compute optimal inter-domain 
   constrained MPLS-TE or GMPLS LSPs. In this path computation method, 
   a specific set of traversed domains (ASes) are assumed to be 
   selected before computation starts. Each downstream PCE in domain(i) 
   returns to its upstream neighbor PCE in domain(i-1) a multipoint-to-
   point tree of potential paths. Each tree consists of the set of 
   paths from all Boundary Nodes located in domain(i) to the 
   destination where each path satisfies the set of required 
   constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities, etc.).  

   So a PCE needs to select Boundary Nodes (that is, ASBRs) that 
   provide connectivity from the upstream AS. In order that the tree of 
   paths provided by one PCE to its neighbor can be correlated, the 
   identities of the ASBRs for each path need to be referenced, so the 
   PCE must know the identities of the ASBRs in the remote AS reached 
   by any inter-AS TE link, and, in order that it provides only 
   suitable paths in the tree, the PCE must know the TE properties of 
   the inter-AS TE links. See the following figure as an example:

                <-- AS1 -->:<---- AS2 --->:<--- AS3 ---> 
    
            Figure 2: BRPC for Inter-AS Reference Model 

   The figure shows three ASes (AS1, AS2, and AS3), three PCEs (PCE1, 
   PCE2, and PCE3), and twelve LSRs (R1 through R12). R3 and R4 are 
   ASBRs in AS1. R5, R6, R7, and R8 are ASBRs in AS2. R9 and R10 are 
   ASBRs in AS3. PCE1, PCE2, and PCE3 cooperate to perform inter-AS 
   path computation and are responsible for path segment computation 
   within their own domain(s).  

   If an inter-AS TE LSP is planned to be established from R1 to R12, 
   the traversed domains are assumed to be selected: AS1->AS2->AS3, and 
   the PCE chain is: PCE1->PCE2->PCE3. First, the path computation 
   request originated from the PCC (R1) is relayed by PCE1 and PCE2 
   along the PCE chain to PCE3, then PCE3 begins to compute the path 
   segments from the entry boundary nodes that provide connection from 
   AS2 to the destination (R12). But, to provide suitable path segments, 
   PCE3 must determine which entry boundary nodes provide connectivity 
   to its upstream neighbor AS (identified by its AS number), and must 
   know the TE properties of the inter-AS TE links. In the same way, 
   PCE2 also needs to determine the entry boundary nodes according to 
   its upstream neighbor AS and the inter-AS TE link capabilities. 

   Thus, to support Backward Recursive Path Computation the same 
   information listed in Section 2.2 is required. The AS number of the 
   neighboring AS connected to by each inter-AS TE link is particularly 
   important. 

3. Extensions to ISIS-TE 

   Note that this document does not define mechanisms for distribution 
   of TE information from one AS to another, does not distribute any 
   form of TE reachability information for destinations outside the AS, 
   does not change the PCE architecture or usage, does not suggest or 
   recommend any form of TE aggregation, and does not feed private 
   information between ASes. See Section 2.1.

Internet-Draft     ISIS extensions for Inter-AS TE         August 2008 
    

   In this document, for the advertisement of inter-AS TE links, a new 
   TLV, which is referred to as the Inter-AS Reachability TLV, is 
   defined and three new sub-TLVs are defined for inclusion in the 
   Inter-AS Reachability TLV to carry the information about the 
   neighboring AS number and the remote ASBR ID of an inter-AS link. 
   The sub-TLVs defined in [ISIS-TE], [ISIS-TE-V3] and other documents 
   for inclusion in the Extended IS Reachability TLV are applicable to 
   be included in the Inter-AS Reachability TLV for inter-AS TE links 
   advertisement. And another two new sub-TLVs are defined for 
   inclusion in the IS-IS Router Capability TLV to carry the TE Router 
   ID when the TE Router ID is needed to reach all routers within an 
   entire ISIS routing domain. 

   While some of the TE information of an inter-AS TE link may be 
   available within the AS from other protocols, in order to avoid any 
   dependency on where such protocols are processed, this mechanism 
   carries all the information needed for the required TE operations. 

3.1. Inter-AS Reachability TLV 

   The Inter-AS Reachability TLV has type 141 (which needs to be 
   confirmed by IANA see Section 6.1), it contains a data structure 
   consisting of: 

      4 octets of Router ID 
      3 octets of default metric 
      1 octet of control information, consisting of: 
         1 bit of flooding-scope information (S bit) 
         1 bit of up/down information (D bit) 
         6 bits reserved 
      1 octet of length of sub-TLVs 
      0-246 octets of sub-TLVs 
         where each sub-TLV consists of a sequence of: 
           1 octet of sub-type 
           1 octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV 
           0-244 octets of value 
    
   Compare to the Extended Reachability TLV which is defined in [ISIS-
   TE], the Inter-AS Reachability TLV replaces the "7 octets of System 
   ID and Pseudonode Number" field with a "4 octets of Router ID" field 
   and introduces an extra "control information" field which is 
   consisted of a flooding-scope bit (S bit), a up/down bit (D bit) and 
   6 reserved bits. 

   The Router ID field of the Inter-AS Reachability TLV is four octets 
   in length, which contains the Router ID of the router who generates

Internet-Draft     ISIS extensions for Inter-AS TE         August 2008 
    

   the Inter-AS Reachability TLV. The Router ID MUST be unique within 
   the ISIS area. If the router generates Inter-AS Reachability TLV 
   with entire ISIS routing domain flooding scope, then the Router ID 
   MUST also be unique within the entire ISIS routing domain. The 
   Router ID could be used to indicate the source of the Inter-AS 
   Reachability TLV. 

   The flooding procedures for Inter-AS Reachability TLV are identical 
   to the flooding procedures for the GNINFO TLV which are defined in 
   the Section 4 of [GENINFO]. These procedures have been previously 
   discussed in [ISIS-CAP]. The flooding-scope bit (S bit) SHOULD be 
   set to 0 if the flooding scope is to be limited to within the single 
   IGP area to which the ASBR belongs, or MAY be set to 1 if the 
   information is intended to reach all routers (including area border 
   routers, ASBRs, and PCEs) in the entire ISIS routing domain. The 
   choice between the use of 0 or 1 is an AS-wide policy choice, and 
   configuration control SHOULD be provided in ASBR implementations 
   that supports the advertisement of inter-AS TE links. 

   The sub-TLVs which are defined in [ISIS-TE], [ISIS-TE-V3] and other 
   documents for describing the TE properties of an TE link are also 
   applicable to be carried in the Inter-AS Reachability TLV to 
   describe the TE properties of an Inter-AS TE link. Apart from these 
   sub-TLVs, three new sub-TLVs are defined for inclusion in the Inter-
   AS Reachability TLV in this document: 

   Sub-TLV type   Length  Name 
   ------------    ------  --------------------------- 
             23        4   Remote AS number 
             24        4   IPv4 Remote ASBR Identifier 
             25       16   IPv6 Remote ASBR Identifier 
              
   The detailed definitions of the three new sub-TLVs are described in 
   Section 3.3. 

3.2. TE Router ID 

   The IPv4 TE Router ID TLV (type 134) and IPv6 TE Router ID TLV (type 
   140), which are defined in [ISIS-TE] and [ISIS-TE-V3] respectively, 
   only have area flooding-scope, when performing inter-AS TE, the TE 
   Router ID MAY be needed to reach all routers within an entire ISIS 
   routing domain, and it MUST have the same flooding scope as the 
   Inter-AS Reachability TLV does. 

   [ISIS-CAP] defines a generic advertisement mechanism for ISIS which 
   allows a router to advertise its capabilities within an ISIS area or 

 
 
Chen, et al.          Expires February 25, 2009               [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft     ISIS extensions for Inter-AS TE         August 2008 
    

   an entire ISIS routing domain. And [ISIS-CAP] also points out that 
   TE Router ID is candidate to be carried in the IS-IS Router 
   Capability TLV when performing inter-area TE. 

   This document uses such mechanism for TE Router ID advertisement 
   when the TE Router ID is needed to reach all routers within an 
   entire ISIS Routing domain. Two new sub-TLVs are defined for 
   inclusion in the IS-IS Router Capability TLV to carry the IPv4 and 
   IPv6 TE Router ID respectively:  

   Sub-TLV type   Length  Name 
   ------------    ------  ----------------- 
             11        4   IPv4 TE Router ID 
             12       16   IPv6 TE Router ID 
    

   The Detailed definitions of the two new sub-TLVs are described in 
   Section 3.3.

   A new sub-TLV, the Remote AS Number sub-TLV is defined for inclusion 
   in the Inter-AS Reachability TLV when advertising inter-AS links. 
   The Remote AS Number sub-TLV specifies the AS number of the 
   neighboring AS to which the advertised link connects. 

   The Remote AS number sub-TLV is TLV type 23 (which needs to be 
   confirmed by IANA see Section 6.2), and is four octets in length. 
   The format is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   The Remote AS number field has 4 octets. When only two octets are 
   used for the AS number, as in current deployments, the left (high-
   order) two octets MUST be set to zero. The Remote AS Number Sub-TLV 
   MUST be included when a router advertises an inter-AS TE link.

3.3.2. IPv4 Remote ASBR ID Sub-TLV 

   A new sub-TLV, which is referred to as the IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-
   TLV, is defined for inclusion in the Inter-AS Reachability TLV when 
   advertising inter-AS links. The IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV 
   specifies the IPv4 identifier of the remote ASBR to which the 
   advertised inter-AS link connects. This could be any stable and 
   routable IPv4 address of the remote ASBR. Use of the TE Router ID as 
   specified in the Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV [ISIS-TE] is 
   RECOMMENDED. 

   The IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV is TLV type 24 (which needs to be 
   confirmed by IANA see Section 6.2), and is four octets in length. 
   The format of the IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   The IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV MUST be included if the neighboring 
   ASBR has an IPv4 address. If the neighboring ASBR does not have an 
   IPv4 address (not even an IPv4 TE Router ID), the IPv6 Remote ASBR 
   ID sub-TLV MUST be included instead. An IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV 
   and IPv6 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV MAY both be present in an Extended 
   IS Reachability TLV. 

3.3.3. IPv6 Remote ASBR ID Sub-TLV 

   A new sub-TLV, which is referred to as the IPv6 Remote ASBR ID sub-
   TLV, is defined for inclusion in the Inter-AS Reachability TLV when 
   advertising inter-AS links. The IPv6 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV 
   specifies the IPv6 identifier of the remote ASBR to which the 
   advertised inter-AS link connects. This could be any stable and 
   routable IPv6 address of the remote ASBR. Use of the TE Router ID as 
   specified in the IPv6 Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV [ISIS-TE-V3] 
   is RECOMMENDED. 

   The IPv6 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV is TLV type 25 (which needs to be 
   confirmed by IANA see Section 6.2), and is sixteen octets in length. 
   The format of the IPv6 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV is as follows:

   The IPv6 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV MUST be included if the neighboring 
   ASBR has an IPv6 address. If the neighboring ASBR does not have an 
   IPv6 address, the IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV MUST be included 
   instead. An IPv4 Remote ASBR ID sub-TLV and IPv6 Remote ASBR ID sub-
   TLV MAY both be present in an Extended IS Reachability TLV. 

3.3.4. IPv4 TE Router ID sub-TLV 

   The IPv4 TE Router ID sub-TLV is TLV type 11 (which needs to be 
   confirmed by IANA see Section 6.3), and is four octets in length. 
   The format of the IPv4 TE Router ID sub-TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   When the TE Router ID is needed to reach all routers within an 
   entire ISIS routing domain, the IS-IS Router Capability TLV MUST be 
   included in its LSP. And if an ASBR supports Traffic Engineering for 
   IPv4, the IPv4 TE Router ID sub-TLV MUST be included if the ASBR has 
   an IPv4 TE Router ID. If the ASBR does not have an IPv4 TE Router ID, 
   the IPv6 TE Router sub-TLV MUST be included instead. An IPv4 TE 
   Router ID sub-TLV and IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV MAY both be present 
   in an IS-IS Router Capability TLV.

   When the TE Router ID is needed to reach all routers within an 
   entire ISIS routing domain, the IS-IS Router Capability TLV MUST be 
   included in its LSP. And if an ASBR supports Traffic Engineering for 
   IPv6, the IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV MUST be included if the ASBR has 
   an IPv6 TE Router ID. If the ASBR does not have an IPv6 TE Router ID, 
   the IPv4 TE Router sub-TLV MUST be included instead. An IPv4 TE 
   Router ID sub-TLV and IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV MAY both be present 
   in an IS-IS Router Capability TLV. 

4. Procedure for Inter-AS TE Links 

   When TE is enabled on an inter-AS link and the link is up, the ASBR 
   SHOULD advertise this link using the normal procedures for ISIS-TE 
   [ISIS-TE]. When either the link is down or TE is disabled on the 
   link, the ASBR SHOULD withdraw the advertisement. When there are 
   changes to the TE parameters for the link (for example, when the 
   available bandwidth changes) the ASBR SHOULD re-advertise the link, 
   but the ASBR MUST take precautions against excessive re-
   advertisements.  

   Hellos MUST NOT be exchanged over the inter-AS link, and 
   consequently, an ISIS adjacency MUST NOT be formed. 

   The information advertised comes from the ASBR's knowledge of the TE 
   capabilities of the link, the ASBR's knowledge of the current status 


 
 
Chen, et al.          Expires February 25, 2009              [Page 13]

   and usage of the link, and configuration at the ASBR of the remote 
   AS number and remote ASBR TE Router ID. 

   Legacy routers receiving an advertisement for an inter-AS TE link 
   are able to ignore it because they do not know the new TLV and sub-
   TLVs that are defined in Section 3 in this document. They will 
   continue to flood the LSP, but will not attempt to use the 
   information received. 

   In the current operation of ISIS TE the LSRs at each end of a TE 
   link emit LSAs describing the link. The databases in the LSRs then 
   have two entries (one locally generated, the other from the peer) 
   that describe the different 'directions' of the link.  This enables 
   CSPF to do a two-way check on the link when performing path 
   computation and eliminate it from consideration unless both 
   directions of the link satisfy the required constraints. 

   In the case we are considering here (i.e., of a TE link to another 
   AS) there is, by definition, no IGP peering and hence no bi-
   directional TE link information. In order for the CSPF route 
   computation entity to include the link as a candidate path, we have 
   to find a way to get LSAs describing its (bidirectional) TE 
   properties into the TE database. 

   This is achieved by the ASBR advertising, internally to its AS, 
   information about both directions of the TE link to the next AS. The 
   ASBR will normally generate a LSA describing its own side of a link; 
   here we have it 'proxy' for the ASBR at the edge of the other AS and 
   generate an additional LSA that describes that devices 'view' of the 
   link. 

   Only some essential TE information for the link needs to be 
   advertised; i.e., the Interface Address, the Remote AS number and 
   the Remote ASBR ID of an inter-AS TE link. 

   Routers or PCEs that are capable of processing advertisements of 
   inter-AS TE links SHOULD NOT use such links to compute paths that 
   exit an AS to a remote ASBR and then immediately re-enter the AS 
   through another TE link. Such paths would constitute extremely rare 
   occurrences and SHOULD NOT be allowed except as the result of 
   specific policy configurations at the router or PCE computing the 
   path.

4.1. Origin of Proxied TE Information 

   Section 4 describes how to an ASBR advertises TE link information as 
   a proxy for its neighbor ASBR, but does not describe where this 
   information comes from.  

   Although the source of this information is outside the scope of this 
   document, it is possible that it will be a configuration requirement 
   at the ASBR, as are other, local, properties of the TE link. Further, 
   where BGP is used to exchange IP routing information between the 
   ASBRs, a certain amount of additional local configuration about the 
   link and the remote ASBR is likely to be available. 

   We note further that it is possible, and may be operationally 
   advantageous, to obtain some of the required configuration 
   information from BGP. Whether and how to utilize these possibilities 
   is an implementation matter. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The protocol extensions defined in this document are relatively 
   minor and can be secured within the AS in which they are used by the 
   existing ISIS security mechanisms. 

   There is no exchange of information between ASes, and no change to 
   the ISIS security relationship between the ASes. In particular, 
   since no ISIS adjacency is formed on the inter-AS links, there is no 
   requirement for ISIS security between the ASes. 

   Some of the information included in these new advertisements (e.g., 
   the remote AS number and the remote ASBR ID) is obtained manually 
   from a neighboring administration as part of commercial relationship. 
   The source and content of this information should be carefully 
   checked before it is entered as configuration information at the 
   ASBR responsible for advertising the inter-AS TE links.  

   It is worth noting that in the scenario we are considering a Border 
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering may exist between the two ASBRs and 
   this could be used to detect inconsistencies in configuration (e.g., 
   the administration that originally supplied the information may be 
   lying, or some manual mis-configurations or mistakes are made by the 
   operators). For example, if a different remote AS number is received 
   in a BGP OPEN [BGP] from that locally configured into ISIS-TE, as we 
   describe here, then local policy SHOULD be applied to determine 
   whether to alert the operator to a potential mis-configuration or to 
   suppress the ISIS advertisement of the inter-AS TE link. Note,

Internet-Draft     ISIS extensions for Inter-AS TE         August 2008 
    

   further, that if BGP is used to exchange TE information as described 
   in Section 4.1, the inter-AS BGP session SHOULD be secured using 
   mechanisms as described in [BGP] to provide authentication and 
   integrity checks. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries 
   under its control. 

6.1. Inter-AS Reachability TLV 

   This document defines the following new ISIS TLV type, described in 
   Section 3.4, that needs to be registered in the ISIS TLV code-point 
   registry: 

              Type        Description              IIH   LSP   SNP 
              ----        ----------------------   ---   ---   --- 
               141        Inter-AS reachability     n     y     n 
                                information 
    

6.2. Sub-TLVs for the Inter-AS Reachability TLV 

   This document defines the following new sub-TLV types, described in 
   Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, of top-level TLV 141 (see section 
   6.1 above) that need to be registered in the ISIS sub-TLV registry 
   for TLV 141, note that these three new sub-TLVs SHOULD NOT appear in 
   TLV 22 (or TLV 222) and MUST be ignored in TLV 22 (or TLV 222): 

      Type        Description                        Length 
      ----        ------------------------------   -------- 
        23        Remote AS number                        4 
        24        IPv4 Remote ASBR Identifier             4 
        25        IPv6 Remote ASBR Identifier            16 
    
   As described above in Section 3.1, the sub-TLVs which are defined in 
   [ISIS-TE], [ISIS-TE-V3] and other documents for describing the TE 
   properties of an TE link are applicable to describe an inter-AS TE 
   link and MAY be included in the Inter-AS Reachability TLV when 
   adverting inter-AS TE links. So, these sub-TLVs need to be 
   registered in the ISIS sub-TLV registry for TLV 141. And in order to 
   simplify the registration, we suggest using the same registry value 
   as they are registered in the ISIS sub-TLV registry for TLV 22.

   Because sub-TLVs defined for TLV 22 can be advertised in the Inter-
   AS Reachability TLV, the new sub-TLVs defined in this document 
   SHOULD NOT conflict with existing and/or future sub-TLV definitions 
   for TLV 22. Therefore the new sub-TLVs MUST be defined from a sub-
   TLV registry which is shared by these two TLVs. 

6.3. Sub-TLVs for the IS-IS Router Capability TLV 

   This document defines the following new sub-TLV types, described in 
   Sections 3.3.4 and 3.3.5, of top-level TLV 242 (which is defined in 
   [ISIS-CAP]) that need to be registered in the ISIS sub-TLV registry 
   for TLV 242: 

      Type        Description                        Length
