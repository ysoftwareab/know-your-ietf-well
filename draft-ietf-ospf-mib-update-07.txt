  Abstract 
  
    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. 
    In particular, it defines objects for managing version 2 of the Open 
    Shortest Path First Routing Protocol. Version 2 of the OSPF protocol 
    is specific to the IPv4 address family. Version 3 of the OSPF 
    protocol is specific to the IPv6 address family.  
  
    This memo is intended to update and obsolete RFC 1850, 
    however, it is designed to be backwards compatible. The functional 
    differences between this memo and RFC 1850 are explained in Appendix 
    B.

  1 Overview 
  
  1.1 The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
     
    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
    RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
     
    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
    the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
    accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
    Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
    Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
    module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
    RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
    [RFC2580]. 
  
  1.2 Conceptual Row Creation 
  
    For the benefit of row-creation in "conceptual" tables, 
    DEFVAL (Default Value) clauses are included in the definitions in 
    section 3, suggesting values which an agent should use for instances 
    of variables which need to be created due to a Set-Request, but which 
    are not specified in the Set-Request. DEFVAL clauses have not been 
    specified for some objects which are read-only, implying that they 
    are zeroed upon row creation.  These objects are of the SYNTAX 
    Counter32 or Gauge32. 
  
    For those objects not having a DEFVAL clause, both management 
    stations and agents should heed the Robustness Principle of the 
    Internet (see RFC-791): 
  
    "be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send" 
  
    Therefore, management stations should include as many of these 
    columnar objects as possible (e.g., all read-write objects) in a Set- 
    Request when creating a conceptual row. Agents should accept a Set-

    Request with as few of these columnar objects as they need (e.g., the 
    minimum contents of a "row-creating" SET consists of those objects 
    for which, as they cannot be intuited, no default is specified.). 
  
  1.3 Default Configuration 
  
    OSPF is a powerful routing protocol, equipped with features to handle 
    virtually any configuration requirement that might reasonably be 
    found within an Autonomous System. With this power comes a fair 
    degree of complexity, which the sheer number of objects in the MIB 
    will attest to.  Care has therefore been taken, in constructing this 
    MIB, to define default values for virtually every object, to minimize 
    the amount of parameterization required in the typical case. That 
    default configuration is as follows: 
  
    Given the following assumptions: 
  
       - IP has already been configured 
  
       - The ifTable has already been configured 
  
       - ifSpeed is estimated by the interface drivers 
  
       - The OSPF Process automatically discovers all IP 
         Interfaces and creates corresponding OSPF Interfaces 
  
       - The OSPF Process automatically creates the Areas required 
         for the Interfaces 
  
    The simplest configuration of an OSPF process requires that: 
  
       - The OSPF Process be Enabled. 
  
    This can be accomplished with a single SET: 
  
       ospfAdminStat := enabled. 
  
    The configured system will have the following attributes: 
  
       - The RouterID will be one of the IP addresses of the 
         device 
  
       - The device will be neither an Area Border Router nor an 
         Autonomous System Border Router. 
  
       - Every IP Interface, with or without an address, will be 
         an OSPF Interface. 
  
       - The AreaID of each interface will be 0.0.0.0, the 
         Backbone. 
  
       - Authentication will be disabled

                               OSPFv2 MIB                  October 2003 
  
  
       - All Broadcast and Point to Point interfaces will be 
         operational.  NBMA Interfaces require the configuration 
         of at least one neighbor. 
  
       - Timers on all direct interfaces will be: 
  
           Hello Interval:        10 seconds 
           Dead Timeout:          40 Seconds 
           Retransmission:         5 Seconds 
           Transit Delay:          1 Second 
           Poll Interval:        120 Seconds 
  
       - No direct links to hosts will be configured. 
  
       - No addresses will be summarized 
  
       - Metrics, being a measure of bit duration, are unambiguous 
         and intelligent. 
  
       - No Virtual Links will be configured. 
  
  1.4 OSPF Counters 
  
   This MIB defines several counters, namely: 
  
       - ospfOriginateNewLsas, ospfRxNewLsas in the ospfGeneralGroup 
       - ospfSpfRuns, ospfAreaNssaTranslatorEvents in the ospfAreaTable 
       - ospfIfEvents in the ospfIfTable 
       - ospfVirtIfEvents in the ospfVirtIfTable 
       - ospfNbrEvents in the ospfNbrTable 
       - ospftVirtNbrEvents in the ospfVirtNbrEvents. 
     
    As a best practice, a management entity when reading these counters, should 
    use the discontinuity object ospfDiscontinuityTime, 
    to determine if an event, which would invalidate the management 
    entity understanding of the counters, has occurred. 
    A restart of the OSPF routing process is a possible example 
    of a discontinuity event. 
     
  1.5 Multiple OSPF Instances 
  
    SNMPv3 supports "Contexts" which can be used to implement MIB views 
    on multiple OSPF instances on the same system. See RFC 3411 
    or its successors for details.  
  
  2 Structure of this MIB 
  
    This MIB is composed of the following sections: 
  
       General Variables 
       Area Data Structure 
       Area Stub Metric Table 
       Link State Database 
   
 Internet Draft            Expires April 2004                  [Page 5] 
                               OSPFv2 MIB                  October 2003 
  
  
       Address Range Table 
       Host Table 
       Interface Table 
       Interface Metric Table 
       Virtual Interface Table 
       Neighbor Table 
       Virtual Neighbor Table 
       External Link State Database 
       Aggregate Range Table 
       Local Link State Database 
       AS-scope Link State Database 
  
    There exists a separate MIB for notifications ("traps"), which is 
    entirely optional. 
  
  2.1 The Purposes of the sections in this MIB 
  
  2.1.1 General Variables 
  
    The General Variables describe (as it may seem from the name) 
    variables which are global to the OSPF Process. 
  
  2.1.2 Area Data Structure and Area Stub Metric Table 
  
    The Area Data Structure describes all of the OSPF Areas that the 
    router participates in. The Area Table includes data for NSSA 
    translation. 
  
    The Area Stub Metric Table describes the metrics advertised into 
    a stub area by the default router(s). 
  
  2.1.3 Link State Database and External Link State Database 
  
    The Link State Database is provided primarily to provide detailed 
    information for network debugging. 
  
  2.1.4 Address Table and Host Tables 
  
    The Address Range Table and Host Table are provided to view 
    configured Network Summary and Host Route information. 
  
  2.1.5 Interface and Interface Metric Tables 
  
    The Table and the Interface Metric Table together describe 
    the various IP interfaces to OSPF. The metrics are placed in 
    separate tables in order to simplify dealing with multiple types of 
    service. The Interface table includes Link-Local (Opaque Type-9) LSA 
    statistics. 
  
  2.1.6 Virtual Interface Table 
  
    The Virtual Interface Table describes virtual links to the 
    OSPF Process, similarly to the (non-Virtual)Interface Tables. This

    table includes Link-Local (Opaque Type-9) LSA statistics. 
  
  2.1.7 Neighbor and Virtual Neighbor Tables 
  
    The Neighbor Table and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the 
    neighbors to the OSPF Process. 
  
  2.1.8 Local Link State Database Table and Virtual 
       Local Link State Database Table 
  
    The Local Link State Database Table and Virtual Local Link State 
    Database Table are identical to the OSPF LSDB Table in 
    format, but contain only Link-Local (Opaque Type-9) Link State 
    Advertisements for non-virtual and virtual links. 
  
  2.1.9 AS-scope Link State Database Table 
  
    The AS-scope Link State Database Table is identical to the OSPF LSDB 
    Table in format, but contains only AS-scoped Link State 
    Advertisements. 
  
  2.1.10 Area Lsa Count Table 
  
    The table, which maintains number of link state advertisements 
    on the per area per LSA type basis.

            If the key length is shorter than 8 octets, the

            Unauthenticated interfaces need no authentication 
            key, and simple password authentication cannot use 
            a key of more than 8 octets. 
  
            Note that the use of simplePassword authentication 
            is NOT recommended when there is concern regarding 
            attack  upon the OSPF system. SimplePassword 
            authentication is only sufficient to protect against 
            accidental misconfigurations because it re-uses 
            cleartext passwords. [RFC-1704]

         MAX-ACCESS   not-accessible

         DESCRIPTION 
            “The Metric Table describes the metrics to be advertised 
            for a specified interface at the various types of service. 
            As such, this table is an adjunct of the OSPF Interface 
            Table. 
  
            Types of service, as defined by RFC 791, have the ability 
            to request low delay, high bandwidth, or reliable linkage. 
  
            For the purposes of this specification, the measure of 
            bandwidth: 
  
            Metric = referenceBandwidth / ifSpeed 
  
            is the default value. 
            The default reference bandwidth is 10^8. 
            For multiple link interfaces, note that ifSpeed is the sum 
            of the individual link speeds. This yields a number having 
            the following typical values: 
  
            Network Type/bit rate   Metric 
  
            >= 100 MBPS                 1 
            Ethernet/802.3             10 
            E1                         48 
            T1 (ESF)                   65 
            64 KBPS                    1562 
            56 KBPS                    1785 
            19.2 KBPS                  5208 
            9.6 KBPS                   10416 
  
            Routes that are not specified use the default (TOS 0) metric 
  
            Note that the default reference bandwidth can be configured 
            using the general group object ospfReferenceBandwidth.”

             Its purpose is to reduce the amount of information 
             which is known beyond Area’s borders. 
  
             It contains a set of IP address ranges  
             specified by an IP address/IP network mask pair. 
             For example, class B address range of X.X.X.X 
             with a network mask of 255.255.0.0 includes all IP addresses 
             from X.X.0.0 to X.X.255.255. 
  
             Note that if ranges are configured such that one range 
             subsumes another range (e.g., 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 
             and 10.1.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0), 
             the most specific match is the preferred one."

  4 OSPF Trap Overview 
  
  4.1 Introduction 
  
   
 Internet Draft            Expires April 2004                 [Page 84] 
                               OSPFv2 MIB                  October 2003 
  
  
    OSPF is an event driven routing protocol, where an event can be a 
    change in an OSPF interface's link-level status, the expiration of an 
    OSPF timer or the reception of an OSPF protocol packet. Many of the 
    actions that OSPF takes as a result of these events will result in a 
    change of the routing topology. 
  
    As routing topologies become large and complex it is often difficult 
    to locate the source of a topology change or unpredicted routing path 
    by polling a large number or routers. Because of the difficulty of 
    polling a large number of devices, a more prudent approach is for 
    devices to notify a network manager of potentially critical OSPF 
    events using SNMP traps. 
  
    This section defines a set of traps, objects and mechanisms to 
    enhance the ability to manage IP internetworks which use OSPF as its 
    IGP. It is an optional but very useful extension to the OSPF MIB. 
  
  4.2 Approach 
  
    The mechanism for sending traps is straight-forward. When an 
    exception event occurs, the application notifies the local agent who 
    sends a trap to the appropriate SNMP management stations. The 
    message includes the trap type and may include a list of trap 
    specific variables. Section 5 gives the trap 
    definitions which includes the variable lists. The router ID 
    of the originator of the trap is included in the variable list 
    so that the network manager may easily determine the source of the 
    trap. 
  
    To limit the frequency of OSPF traps, the following additional 
    mechanisms are suggested. 
  
  4.3 Ignoring Initial Activity 
  
    The majority of critical events occur when OSPF is enabled on a 
    router, at which time the designated router is elected and neighbor 
    adjacencies are formed.  During this initial period a potential 
    flood of traps is unnecessary since the events are expected. To avoid 
    unnecessary traps, a router should not originate expected OSPF 
    interface related traps until two of that interface's dead timer 
    intervals have elapsed. The expected OSPF interface traps are 
    ospfIfStateChange, ospfVirtIfStateChange, ospfNbrStateChange, 
    ospfVirtNbrStateChange, ospfTxRetranmit and ospfVirtIfTxRetransmit. 
    Additionally, ospfMaxAgeLsa and ospfOriginateLsa traps should not be 
    originated until two dead timer intervals have elapsed where the dead 
    timer interval used should be the dead timer with the smallest value. 
  
  4.4 Throttling Traps 
  
    The mechanism for throttling the traps is similar to the mechanism 
    explained in RFC 1224 [24]. The basic premise of the throttling 
    mechanism is that of a sliding window, defined in seconds and an 
    upper bound on the number of traps that may be generated within this 
   
 Internet Draft            Expires April 2004                 [Page 85] 
                               OSPFv2 MIB                  October 2003 
  
  
    window. Note that unlike RFC 1224, traps are not sent to inform the 
    network manager that the throttling mechanism has kicked in. 
  
    A single window should be used to throttle all OSPF traps types 
    except for the ospfLsdbOverflow and the ospfLsdbApproachingOverflow 
    trap which should not be throttled.  For example, with a window time 
    of 3, an upper bound of 3, and events to cause trap types 1,3,5 and 7 
    (4 traps within a 3 second period), the type 7 (the 4th) trap should 
    not be generated. 
  
    Appropriate values are 7 traps with a window time of 10 seconds. 
  
  4.5 One Trap Per OSPF Event 
  
    Several of the traps defined in section 5 are 
    generated as the result of finding an unusual condition while 
    parsing an OSPF packet or a processing a timer event.  There 
    may be more than one unusual condition detected while handling 
    the event. For example, a link-state update packet may contain 
    several retransmitted link-state advertisements (LSAs), or a 
    retransmitted database description packet may contain several 
    database description entries. To limit the number of traps and 
    variables, OSPF should generate at most one trap per OSPF event. 
    Only the variables associated with the first unusual condition 
    should be included with the trap. Similarly, if more than 
    one type of unusual condition is encountered while parsing the 
    packet, only the first event will generate a trap. 
  
  4.6 Polling Event Counters 
  
    Many of the tables in the OSPF MIB contain generalized event 
    counters. By enabling the traps defined in this document a network 
    manager can obtain more specific information about these events. A 
    network manager may want to poll these event counters and enable 
    specific OSPF traps when a particular counter starts increasing 
    abnormally. 
  
    The following table shows the relationship between the event counters 
    defined in the OSPF MIB and the trap types defined in section x.

  A TOS Support 
  
    For backward compatibility with previous versions of the OSPF 
    MIB specification, TOS-specific information has been retained 
    in this document, though the TOS routing option has been 
    deleted from OSPF [RFC 2178].

  B.8 Miscellaneous 
  
    Various sections, have been moved and or modified for clarity. 
    Most of these changes are semantic in nature, and include, 
    but are not limited to: 
  
       -The OSPF Overview section's format was revised. Unneeded 
        information was removed. Removed information includes OSPF TOS 
        default values. 
  
       -The Trap Overview section's format and working were revised. 
        Unneeded information was removed. 
  
       -Modified the DESCRIPTION clause of "Status" "TEXTUAL-CONVENTION" 
        for clarity 
  
       -The updates section was moved from the Overview to an appendix 
  
       -Updated "REFERENCE" clauses in all objects, as needed 
  
       -Modified the SEQUENCE of the OspfIfTable to reflect the true 
        order of the objects in the Table 
  
       -Modified the DESCRIPTION clause of all row management objects 
        for clarity 
  
    Added ospfHostCfgAreaID to object to Host table with read-create 
    access. 
  
    Added importation of InterfaceIndexOrZero from IF-MIB. This TEXTUAL- 
    CONVENTION will replace the InterfaceIndex TEXTUAL-CONVENTION. 
  
    Changed the SYNTAX clause of ospfNbrAddressLessIndex to use the 
    semantically identical InterfaceIndexOrZero TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, as 
    permitted by the SMI. 
  
    Changed the STATUS clause of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION InterfaceIndex 
    to obsolete and modified the DESCRIPTION accordingly. 
  
    Changed the SYNTAX clause of ospfAddressLessIf to use the 
    semantically identical InterfaceIndexOrZero TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, as 
    permitted by the SMI. 
  
    Changed the SYNTAX clause of ospfIfMetricAddressLessIf to use the 
    semantically identical InterfaceIndexOrZero TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, as 
    permitted by the SMI. 
  
    Changed importation of mib-2 from RFC1213-MIB to SNMPv2-SMI

    Added Intellectual Property Rights section. 
  
    Updated REVISION DESCRIPTION clauses with description of major MIB 
    modifications. 
  
    Moved all relevant MIB comments to objects’ DESCRIPTION clauses. 
  
    Added reasoning for object deprecation. 
  
    Added persistence information for read-write, read-create objects. 
  
    Described conditions when columns can be modified in RowStatus 
    managed rows as required by RFC 2579. 
  
    Defined ‘OspfAuthType’ TC and modified authentication type objects 
    to use the new type. 
  
    Made index objects of new tables not-accessible. 
  
    Added the UNITS clause to several objects. 
  
    Added ospfIfDesignatedRouterId and ospfIfBackupDesignatedRouterId 
    to the OspfIfEntry. 
  
    Added the area LSA counter table. 
  
  C Security Considerations 
  
    There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
    have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such 
    objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
    environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
    environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
    network operations. 
  
    It is recommended that attention be specifically given to 
    implementing the MAX-ACCESS clause in a number of objects, including 
    ospfIfAuthKey, ospfIfAuthType, ospfVirtIfAuthKey, and 
    ospfVirtIfAuthType in scenarios that DO NOT use SNMPv3 strong 
    security (i.e. authentication and encryption). Extreme caution must 
    be used to minimize the risk of cascading security vulnerabilities 
    when SNMPv3 strong security is not used. When SNMPv3 strong security 
    is not used, these objects should have access of read-only, not read- 
    create. 
  
    SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
    itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
    control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
    GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
  
    It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
    features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
    of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-

    based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended. 
  
    It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
    entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
    configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
    (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
    (change/create/delete) them.
