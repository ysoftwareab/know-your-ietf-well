Internet Draft                syslogMIB-TC                    April 2008


Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent
   Facility and Severity information commonly used in syslog messages.
   The intent is that these textual conventions will be imported and
   used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2. Background

   Operating systems, processes and applications, collectively termed
   "Facilities" in the following, generate messages indicating their own
   status or the occurrence of events. These messages have come to be
   known as syslog messages. A syslog message in general will contain
   among other things a code representing the Facility that generated
   the message and a code representing the Severity of the message. The
   Facility and the Severity codes are commonly used to categorize and
   select received syslog messages for processing and display. The
   Facility codes have been useful in qualifying the originator of the
   content of the messages but in some cases they are not specific
   enough to explicitly identify the originator. Implementations of the
   syslog protocol [RFCZZZZ] that contain Structured Data Elements
   (SDEs) should use these SDEs to clarify the entity that originated
   the content of the message.

   This document defines a set of textual conventions (TCs) that can be
   used to represent Facility and Severity codes commonly used in syslog
   messages.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   SyslogFacility  ::=  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
           "This textual convention enumerates the Facilities that
            originate syslog messages.

            The Facilities of syslog messages are numerically coded
            with decimal values. For interoperability and backwards
            compatibility reasons, this document specifies a
            normative mapping between a label which represents a
            Facility and the corresponding numeric value. This label
            could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager user
            interfaces.

            The label itself is often semantically meaningless,
            because it is impractical to attempt to enumerate all
            possible Facilities, and many daemons and processes do
            not have an explicitly assigned Facility code or label.
            For example, there is no Facility label corresponding to
            a HTTP server.  A HTTP server application might log
            messages as coming from, for example, 'local7' or 'uucp'.
            This is typical current practice, and originators, relays
            and collectors know how to handle this situation. For
            improved accuracy, an application can also include
            an APPNAME Structured Data Element.

            Note that operating system facilities for configuring
            syslog, such as syslog.conf, may use different set of
            Facility labels and/or mapping between Facility labels and
            Facility codes. In particular, the labels corresponding
            to Facility codes 4, 10, 13, and 14, and the code
            corresponding to the Facility label 'cron' are not
            consistent across different operating systems.

            The mapping specified here MUST be used in SNMP contexts,
            even though a particular syslog implementation would use
            a different mapping.

   SyslogSeverity  ::=  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
           "This textual convention enumerates the Severity levels
            of syslog messages.

            The Severity levels of syslog messages are numerically
            coded with decimal values. For interoperability and
            backwards compatibility reasons, this document specifies
            a normative mapping between a label which represents a
            Severity level and the corresponding numeric value.
            This label could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager
            user interfaces.

            The label itself is often semantically meaningless,
            because it is impractical to attempt to strictly define
            the criteria for each Severity level, and the criteria
            that is used by syslog originators is, and has
            historically been, implementation-dependent.

            So the mapping from a label configured by operators in
            syslog.conf or equivalent will consistently map to the
            same Severity code regardless of implementation.

            For example, the foobar application might log messages
            as 'crit' based on some subjective criteria. Yet the
            operator can configure syslog.conf to have local7.crit
            messages be relayed, even though the criteria for 'crit'
            may differ from one originator to another. This is
            typical current practice, and originators, relays and
            collectors know how to handle this situation.

4. Security Considerations


   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.  Meaningful security
   considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define
   management objects.  This document has therefore no impact on the
   security of the Internet.  Since objects defined using the TCs
   defined in this document may introduce security issues, the user of
   these TCs should read the security considerations section of
   [RFCZZZZ].


5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------

   syslogTCMIB       { mib-2 YYYY }

   IANA Reg.: Please assign a value under the 'mib-2' subtree
              for the 'syslogTCMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY  and record
              the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

   RFC Ed.: When the above assignments have been made, please
              - remove the above note
              - replace "YYYY" here with the assigned values and
              - remove this note.
