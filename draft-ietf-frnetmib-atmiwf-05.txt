1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
        RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable

   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for
   monitoring and controlling a service interworking function (IWF) for
   Permanent Virtual Connections (PVC) between Frame Relay and
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technologies.  The agreements on
   which this MIB is based were reached jointly by the Frame Relay Forum
   and the ATM Forum and are documented in the Frame Relay Forum
   Document FRF.8 [17].


3.1.  Frame Relay/ATM Service Interworking Background

   Frame relay to ATM interworking is a function that exchanges Protocol
   Data Units (PDU) between a frame relay service user and an ATM
   service user. Two types of interworking functions are specified for
   frame relay and ATM permanent virtual connection (PVC) service users:
   network interworking and service interworking.

   Network interworking provides PDU forwarding between frame relay
   service users inter-connected by an ATM service. Both endpoints are
   frame relay PVCs. Frame Relay to ATM PVC Network Interworking is
   defined in [20].

   Service interworking provides PDU forwarding so that the ATM service
   user performs no frame relaying service-specific functions and the
   frame relay service user performs no ATM service-specific functions.
   Optionally, the service IWF translates particular higher layer
   protocols to satisfy the requirements of end-systems.  Frame Relay to
   ATM PVC Service Interworking is defined in [20].

   This MIB describes management objects used to provision, monitor, and
   control a Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF.

   FRF.8 [17] does not address point-to-multipoint applications of the
   IWF.  Implementations MAY provide support for point-to-multipoint
   capability using this MIB.

   Consult FRF.8 [17] for more details on the operation of a Frame
   Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF.

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


3.2.  Structure of the MIB

   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF managed objects are organized as
   follows:

    (1) FR/ATM PVC Service IWF cross-connect table,

    (2) Connection description table, and

    (3) Notification object

   The IWF cross-connect table contains one or more rows for each
   inter-worked connection. Each inter-worked connection is uniquely
   identified by the frAtmIwfConnIndex object. In the case of point-to-
   point, a single row is present. In the case of point-to-multipoint,
   one row exists for each multipoint destination.  Index objects for
   the ATM port, VPI, VCI, frame relay port, and frame relay DLCI
   distinguish the constituent rows used in a point-to-multipoint case.

   Each inter-worked connection has attributes governing behavior of the
   IWF. These attributes describe how the IWF should transform a PDU
   during the forwarding process and provide rules for:

    (1) Mapping the ATM CLP bit to frame relay DE bit

    (2) Mapping the ATM congestion notification bit to frame relay
        congestion bits

    (3) Mapping higher protocol encapsulations between ATM and frame
        relay

    (4) Performing fragmentation and reassembly

    (5) Performing ARP translation between ATM and frame relay

   Typically, most connections share the same attributes. The attributes
   are represented in this MIB by the connection description table. Each
   row of the connection description table contains the attribute
   settings common to one or more inter-worked connections. One example
   would be full mapping and translation. All cross-connect table
   entries that require full mapping and translation services set the
   frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor object to the index value for the
   connection description table row that contains objects set to values
   that provide full mapping and translation services.

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


   A notification object provides cross-connect status change alerts.


3.3.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB describes the cross-
   connections between frame relay and ATM service users. Each PVC
   endpoint is provisioned and managed with a technology-specific MIB as
   described below.

   Each technology-specific MIB has a table of PVC endpoints (indexed by
   ifIndex and logical link address such as the DLCI or VPI/VCI). In the
   absence of interworking, two endpoints are cross-connected via a
   technology-specific cross connect table (e.g., the
   atmVcCrossConnectTable in the ATM MIB).  However, a connection
   between a frame relay endpoint and an ATM endpoint requires a cross-
   connect in the ATM IWF MIB.

   The following sections describe the relationship between the
   technology-specific MIBs and the FR/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB.


3.3.1.  Frame Relay Service MIB

   Frame relay PVC endpoints are provisioned as rows in the Frame Relay
   Services MIB [19] endpoint table.

   Each frame relay PVC endpoint is described in the frPVCEndptTable. A
   connection between two frame relay endpoints is described by an entry
   in the frame relay PVC cross-connect table frPVCConnectTable.  The
   frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object of each endpoint points to the
   frPVCConnectTable cross-connect table row for the connection.

   In the case of an inter-worked connection, the
   frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object is set to zero.  Instead, the
   frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex object is set to the index of the FR/ATM
   IWF cross-connect table row.

   The frame relay PVC cross-connect table (frPVCConnectTable) does not
   contain an entry for the FR/ATM inter-worked connection.

   Note that the frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier and
   frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex objects are set by the system as a side-
   effect of cross-connect establishment.  Consequently, these objects
   are read-only.

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


3.3.2.  Frame Relay DTE MIB

   The Frame Relay DTE MIB described in [19] has no relevance to the
   FR/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB.


3.3.3.  ATM MIB

   ATM PVC endpoints are provisioned as rows in the ATM MIB [21] virtual
   connection link table.

   Each ATM connection endpoint is described in the atmVclTable. A
   connection between two ATM endpoints is described by an entry in the
   ATM VCL cross-connect table atmVcCrossConnectTable. The
   atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier object of each endpoint points to the
   atmVcCrossConnectTable row for the connection.

   In the case of an inter-worked connection, the
   atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier object is set to zero.  Instead, the
   frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier object in the frAtmIwfVclEntry is
   set to the index of the applicable FR/ATM IWF cross-connect table
   row.

   Note that the frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier object is defined not
   in the ATM MIB but in Section 5 of this MIB.  Specifically, the
   object is defined as a column object in a table that AUGMENTs the ATM
   MIB VCL table.

   The ATM VCL cross-connect table (atmVcCrossConnectTable) does not
   contain an entry for the inter-worked connection.

   Note that the atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier and
   frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier objects are set by the system as a
   side-effect of cross-connect establishment.  Consequently, these
   objects are read-only.


3.3.4.  IF MIB

   The ifIndex defined in the IF MIB [22] identifies the specific frame
   relay and ATM endpoint interfaces.  The values frAtmIwfConnAtmPort
   and frAtmIwfConnFrPort is used in this MIB as a component in the
   index list for the frAtmIwfConnectionTable rows.

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


3.4.  Point to Multipoint Considerations

   This MIB supports IWF implementations providing point-to-multipoint
   functionality. All rows of the cross-connect table indexed by the
   same frAtmIwfConnIndex MUST utilize the same
   frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor value.

   A group of cross-connect table entries indexed by the same
   frAtmIwfConnIndex value MUST agree on which service the multipoint
   operation is offered. Two cases are possible:

    (1) Many frame relay PVCs cross-connected to one ATM PVC, or

    (2) One frame relay PVC cross-connected to many ATM PVCs

3.5.  Theory of Operation

3.5.1.  Creation Process

   Multiple steps are required to create a frame relay to ATM cross-
   connection.  First, rows must be created in the following tables:

    (1) The Frame Relay Service MIB frPVCEndptTable

    (2) The ATM MIB atmVclTable

    (3) The FR/ATM Service IWF MIB frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorTable

    (4) The FR/ATM Service IWF MIB frAtmIwfConnectionTable

   Second, the newly created rows are cross-linked.

   Finally, the administrative and operational status objects are set to
   'up(1)'.

   A step-by-step example is provided to illustrate the creation
   process.  In this example, the term "Manager" refers to a network
   management system that issues SNMP protocol actions to an "Agent".
   The agent is integrated with the system that implements the frame
   relay to ATM service IWF.  In this example, the following cross-
   connection is created:
                  +-------------------------------------+
   +---------+    |        FR/ATM PVC Service IWF       |
   | Frame   |    |    ------------------------------   |    +-----------+
   | Relay   |  +---------> frAtmIwfConnIndex K <---------+  |   ATM     |
   |Endpoint |  | |                V                    | |  | Endpoint  |
   | ------- |  | |                |                    | |  | --------- |
   | DLCI X  |  | |   +------------+                    | |  |VPI.VCI Q.R|
   |  on     |<-+ |   |                                 | +->|    on     |
   |ifIndex Y|    |   V                                 |    | ifIndex S |
   +---------+    | frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorIndex L |    +-----------+
                  +-------------------------------------+

   Step 1 - Create the frame relay PVC endpoint

   a) Manager requests creation of a new row in the frPVCEndptTable

   b) Agent receives management request to create a row in
      frPVCEndptTable for the frame relay side

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


   c) A new row is created in frPVCEndptTable as follows:

       - frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier initialized to zero

       - frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex initialized to zero

       - remaining row objects initialized as needed for DLCI X
         on ifIndex Y


   Step 2 - Create the ATM PVC endpoint

   a) Agent receives management request to create a row in atmVclTable
      for the ATM side

   b) A new row is created in atmVclTable and frAtmIwfVclTable (the
      AUGMENT to the atmVclTable) as follows:

       - atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier initialized to zero

       - frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier initialized to zero

       - atmVclConnKind initialized to pvc(1)

       - remaining row objects initialized as needed for VPI.VCI
         Q.R on ifIndex S


   Step 3 - Create the FR/ATM connection descriptor

   a) If an existing connection descriptor is appropriate for the
      new connection, go to Step 4 using the selected connection
      descriptor index value L

   b) Manager request a new connection descriptor index value by
      reading frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorIndexNext from the agent

   c) Agent receives GET request for
      frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorIndexNext and responds with the
      next available value L

   d) Manager requests a new connection descriptor row entry using
      the value L as the index

   e) Agent receives SET request to create the

      frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorTable row entry causes the system
      to create a row in the table.


   Step 4 - Create the FR/ATM cross-connect

   a) Manager requests a new cross-connect index value by reading
      frAtmIwfConnIndexNext from the agent

   b) Agent receives GET request for frAtmIwfConnIndexNext
      and responds with the next available value K

   c) Manager requests a new cross-connect row entry using the value
      K as the index

   d) Agent receives SET request to create the frAtmIwfConnectionTable
      row entry (note: the frame relay and ATM PVC endpoints MUST exist
      and be specified as part of the index fields for the
      row 'K.S.Q.R.Y.X')

   e) System creates a row in frAtmIwfConnectionTable for the following
      indices:

       - frAtmIwfConnIndex of K

       - frAtmIwfConnAtmPort of S

       - frAtmIwfConnVpi of Q

       - frAtmIwfConnVci of R

       - frAtmIwfConnFrPort of Y

       - frAtmIwfConnDlci of X

       - frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor of L


   Step 5 - The system sets the frame relay PVC endpoint and ATM VCL
   endpoint to point to the FR/ATM cross-connect row (as a side-effect
   of Step 4).

   a) System sets frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex to K

   b) System sets frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier to K

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


   Step 6 - Manager signals activation by issuing a SET for the
   frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus object using the value of 'up(1)'


   Step 7 - Agent receives SET request for frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus and
   executes internal system mechanisms to activate each PVC segment and
   the IWF cross-connect. The successful activation permits the agent to
   respond with 'up(1)' when a GET request is received for the following
   fields:

       - frAtmIwfConnAtm2FrOperStatus

       - frAtmIwfConnFr2AtmOperStatus

       - atmVclOperStatus (Note: there is no comparable FRS MIB object)



3.5.2.  Destruction Process

   Destruction of the frame relay to ATM cross-connection is initiated
   by the network management system.  The agent's processing of the
   request stimulates implementation-specific system clean-up actions.
   Following removal of the row in the cross-connection table, the
   frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier in the frAtmIwfVclTable (AUGMENT of
   the ATM MIB endpoint table) and frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex in the
   Frame Relay Service MIB endpoint table are both re-initialized to
   zero.

   A step-by-step example is provided to illustrate the destruction
   process.

   Step 1 - Manager requests destruction of an existing row in the
   frAtmIwfConnectionTable by setting frAtmIwfConnRowStatus to
   destroy(6)


   Step 2 - Agent receives the SET request and performs implementation-
   specific system clean-up actions for the cross-connection row


   Step 3 - System updates the relevant cross connect information for
   the frame relay PVC endpoint by setting frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex to
   0

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


   Step 4 - System updates the relevant cross connect information for
   the ATM PVC endpoint as follows:

   a) System sets frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier to 0

   b) System sets atmVclOperStatus to 'down(2)' (Note: there is no
      comparable FRS MIB object)


   Following the destruction of the FR/ATM cross-connection entry, the
   manager MAY set the frPVCConnectRowStatus and/or atmVclRowStatus to
   destroy(6) the associated endpoint entries.



3.5.3.  Modification Process

   At the discretion of the agent, a FR/ATM cross-connect may be
   reconfigured by adding and/or deleting leafs to/from the IWF topology
   as per the FR/ATM IWF cross-connect creation/destruction procedures.
   Reconfiguration of traffic/service category parameter values requires
   release of the FR/ATM IWF cross-connect before those parameter values
   may be changed for individual frame relay or ATM endpoint segments.

Internet Draft     FR to ATM Service Interworking MIB         March 2000


4.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

                      is represented by a single row in the FR/ATM IWF
                      Connection Table.  The case of a single frame
                      relay PVC connected to multiple ATM PVCs (or
                      single ATM PVC connected to multiple frame relay
                      PVCs) is referred to as a `point-to-multipoint'
                      connection and is represented by multiple rows in
                      the FR/ATM IWF Connection Table.

                      The object frAtmIwfConnIndex uniquely identifies
                      each point-to-point or point-to-multipoint
                      connection.  The manager obtains the
                      frAtmIwfConnIndex value by reading the
                      frAtmIwfConnIndexNext object.

                      After a frAtmIwfConnIndex is assigned for the
                      connection, the manager creates one or more rows
                      in the Cross Connect Table; one for each cross-
                      connection between the frame relay PVC and an ATM
                      PVC. In the case of `point-to-multipoint'
                      connections, all rows are indexed by the same
                      frAtmIwfConnIndex value and MUST refer to the same
                      frame relay PVC or ATM PVC respectively.  An entry
                      can be created only when at least one pair of
                      frame relay and ATM PVCs exist.

                      A row can be established by one-step set-request
                      with all required parameter values and
                      frAtmIwfConnRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). The
                      Agent should perform all error checking as needed.
                      A pair of cross-connected PVCs, as identified by a
                      particular value of the indexes, is released by
                      setting frAtmIwfConnRowStatus to destroy(6). The
                      Agent may release all associated resources. The
                      manager may remove the related PVCs thereafter.
                      Indexes are persistent across reboots of the

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
