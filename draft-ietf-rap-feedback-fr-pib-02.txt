Abstract 
     Currently there are no policy classes defined for the PEP to convey 
     provisioned policy usage feedback to the PDP. The purpose of this 
     document is to define the policy usage feedback framework PIB that 
     specifies the policy classes common for COPS feedback reports. The 
     basic operation and objects for reporting usage information are 
     defined in [COPS]. A specific clientSI feedback object named REPORT 
     is defined in [COPS-PR]. A framework for approaching solicited and 
     periodic usage feedback is described in [COPS-FEED-FRWK.]The COPS-

1 Introduction  
    
   The Framework of COPS-PR Usage Feedback describes the overall 
   approach to policy usage monitoring and reporting. This document 
   defines the specific Policy Information Base (PIB) framework for 
   policy usage feedback. The policy classes for monitoring and 
   reporting policy usage feedback as well as policy classes for 
   controlling reporting intervals, suspension, resumption and 
   solicitation are also defined. 
    
2 General Concepts  
     
2.1 Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies  
    
   There are three basic types of policy used to define what the PEP is 
   to monitor, record and report. These are the selection criteria 
   policy, the usage policy and the feedback report linkage policy.  
         
   The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP. It defines the 
   conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy. The 
   selection criteria policy may only be used for defining usage 
   feedback selection criteria. However, the more general case is that a 
   policy that already exists for policy enforcement may also be used 
   for specifying feedback usage selection criteria. An example of this 
   is the qosClfrElementEntry which is useful in defining QoS 
   enforcement policies but may also be used to specify conditions on 
   which to base usage - i.e. count the number of packets meeting the 
   criterion.  
        
   The usage policy defines what attributes are monitored and recorded 
   by the PEP. These policies have an ACCESS clause of Report. 
   Generally, the usage policies specify counts related to a specific 
   action such as a packet being dropped. The feedback framework PIB 
   defines two usage policy classes, frwkFeedbackTrafficUsage and 
   frwkFeedbackIfTrafficUsage. Usage PRCs may be generic, collecting 
   basic statistics, or they may be specific to a particular usage. The 
   PDP decides which PRC(s) best suit(s) its requirements. The PEP may 
   support only one usage feedback PRC, in which case all statistics are 
   gathered using instances of that PRC. Alternatively, the PEP may 
   support multiple usage feedback PRCs. The PDP then decides which PRC 
   to associate with a particular selection criterion.  
     
    
   A usage feedback policy and selection policy are tightly associated 
   with one another. A third policy, the frwkFeedbackLinkTable, is used 
   to associate, or provide a linkage for the selection and usage 
   policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable also specifies when to report the 
   usage feedback.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable entry permits the same 
   selection criteria instance to be re-used for various usage feedback 
   policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable contains the value of the 
   selection criteria instance as well as contains the value of the 
   usage feedback PRC.

   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between a selection criteria, 
   linkage and usage policies.   
        
   The PDP is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage feedback 
   policy when installing the selection criteria and feedback linkage 
   policies. The usage feedback policy is instantiated on the PEP by the 
   installation of a feedback report linkage and the PEP designates the 
   instance identifier. The usage feedback policy class always contains 
   an attribute of type ReferenceId that contains the instance value of 
   the associated frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance installed by the PDP. 
   An example of this is the attribute frwkFeddbackTrafficUsageLinkRef 
      
    
2.2 Normal Operations 
    
2.2.1 Connection Establishment and Initial Configuration Request   
        
   The Accounting Timer object in the Connection Accept message contains 
   the minimum number of seconds between reporting intervals as 
   described in [COPS] and [COPS-FEEDBACK-FRWK.] This is used as the 
   basic unit of measurement in defining intervals for specific usage 
   policies with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute.  
    
   The PEP notifies the PDP of the selection criteria policy classes and 
   usage policy classes it supports during the initial request for 
   configuration data using the frwkPRCSupportTable entries [FR-PIB]. 
   The PEP also indicates whether it supports the frwkFeedbackLinkTable 
   as well. 
         
   The PDP responds to the initial request for configuration with a 
   DECISION that installs policies. The PDP may also specify maximum 
   reporting intervals associated with each of the usage policies. This 
   is done with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute in the 
   frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance. It may also specify reporting 
   thresholds by including an instance of a threshold class (e.g. 
   frwkFeedbackTrafficThresholdTable) in the decision. The PEP monitors 
   and records the usage per the conditions defined by its associated

   selection criteria policy. Periodically the PEP reports the usage 
   with a REPORT message or provides a REPORT when solicited by the PDP. 
   The PDP solicits usage feedback with the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator 
   attribute of the frwkFeedbackActionTable.   
        
       
2.2.2 Unsolicited Reports - Periodic Reporting 
    
   Reporting may be periodic in nature and unsolicited. The intervals 
   at which the unsolicited reports are provided by the PEP are defined 
   in the specific Linkage policies. The defined intervals are based on 
   the number of seconds specified by the PDP in the ACCT Timer value. 
   The PDP may specify that the associated usage instance be included 
   in a periodic unsolicited report only if the threshold is reached 
   and/or if the usage value has changed from the previous reporting 
   interval.  
    
   There are cases when the PEP must supply unsolicited feedback 
   reports that may not fall on an interval boundary. The PEP MUST 
   provide an unsolicited REPORT containing all defined usages 
   instances just prior to the PEP issuing a Delete Request State and 
   just prior to the PEP de-activating a PIB instance context. 
 
2.2.3 Unsolicited Reports - Reporting Conditions 
 
   Periodic unsolicited reports for individual usage feedback instances 
   can be suppressed by specifying additional conditions in the 
   frwkFeedbackLinkTable. Supported conditions are: 
   ChangeOnly 
        If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags field, the 
        associated usage instance is only included in a periodic 
        unsolicited report if its value changed since the last 
        unsolicited report.  
         
   Threshold 
        If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags field, the 
        associated usage instance is only included in a periodic 
        unsolicited report, if the threshold condition referenced in 
        the frwkLinkThreshold field evaluates successfully for the 
        associated usage instance.  
         
   Both conditions can be combined in one frwkFeedbackLinkUsage object. 
   In this case both conditions need to succeed for the usage instance 
   to be reported. 
    
   Unsolicited reports triggered by a Delete Request State or the 
   deactivation of a PIB instance are not subject to these conditions - 
   all usage objects must be included in these cases.  
 
 
2.2.4 Solicited Reports 
    

  
Rawlins et al.          Expires September 2002                [Page 6] 

Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB                 March 2002 
 
 
   The PDP may solicit policy usage feedback by issuing an unsolicited 
   Decision containing the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to SOLICIT 
   USAGE REPORT NOW. The PEP is to provide a solicited REPORT feedback 
   containing usage feedback. The PEP shall continue to provide 
   periodic feedback as well at the specified intervals established at 
   client connection acceptance. 
   The reporting conditions (ChangeOnly and Threshold) do not affect 
   solicited reports - all requested usage instances must be included. 
  
2.2.5 Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting    
               
   The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and tracking at the PEP with the 
   frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to SUSPEND USAGE MONITORING AND 
   REPORTS. The PEP must stop tracking usage information and must not 
   issue any feedback reports. The PDP may only suspend feedback 
   reporting by setting the ActionIndicator to SUSPEND REPORTS ONLY. The 
   PEP must cease sending unsolicited reports but is to continue 
   monitoring and tracking usage. The PDP may resume the sending of 
   feedback reports and may resume usage monitoring by setting the 
   ActionIndicator to RESUME USAGE AND REPORTING.  
    
   The PDP may suspend or resume all usage instances or the PDP may 
   specify one or more instances that are to be suspended or resumed. 
   The frwkFeedbackActionList contains a tag identifier that references 
   a list of one or more frwkFeedbackActionListTable entries. 
    
   The PDP may halt usage monitoring, tracking and reporting of usage 
   policies by removing the associated Linkage entry.  
    
    
 2.2.6 Failover   
        
   In the event the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the PEP 
   continues to track usage information as long as it continues to 
   operate with the installed policy. When the locally installed policy 
   at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.  
        
   Upon successful reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy, 
   the PDP indicates to the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the 
   COPS accounting type report messages. The PDP does this 
   deterministically. It issues an unsolicited decision containing the 
   frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator set to resume reporting. The PEP should 
   resume reporting at the next appropriate feedback interval 
   established upon the acceptance of the re-connection.  The PDP is 
   aware of the request state Handle(s) and the supported PRCs either 
   through the state synchronization mechanism or because the PDP 
   considers itself synchronized with the PEP upon reconnection.   
 
2.3 Detail Policy Usage Feedback Reporting 
    
   Some of the policy objects created in the PEP with COPS-PR can be 
   used by the PEP multiple times - they effectively act as templates 
   for the objects created by the PEP. COPS-PR only has the identity

   (OID) of the object that is shared between all the assignment the 
   PEP created, however it is desirable to collect usage information 
   for each of the derived objects individually. 
    
   This capability is achieved in the feedback framework PIB by 
   distributing additional information to qualify a specific assignment 
   of an object between the selection criteria PRC and the feedback 
   usage PRC. 
    
   A selection criteria PRC that refers to a shared object but contains 
   no qualifying information selects all of the object's assignment. 
   Such a selection criteria PRC should be combined with a feedback 
   usage PRC that includes all the necessary information to identify a 
   specific assignment - a single selection criteria policy can then 
   result in the generation of many feedback usage objects, one for 
   each derived object. 
    
   If the selection criteria PRC contains all the required qualifying 
   attributes for a specific assignment, it is combined with a feedback 
   usage PRC that only contains the desired metrics but no additional 
   attributes. 
    
   Example: 
      As part of a data path, an IPFilter object can be assigned to 
      many combinations of interface and direction.  
      To refer to a specific assignment of an IPFilter for feedback 
      purposes, the reference to the IPFilter instance has to be 
      qualified with the interface and direction attributes.  
  
      Feedback from the filter on a specific interface: 
        As the selection criteria policy a 
        frwkFeedbackDPESelectionEntry is used which contains the 
        qualifying attributes:   
                frwkFeedbackDPESelectionDataPathElement      Prid  
                frwkFeedbackDPESelectionInterface            Prid  
                frwkFeedbackDPESelectionIfDirection   IfDirection 
        In this case this policy would be combined in a 
        frwkLinkageEntry with the FrwkFeedbackTrafficUsage PRC. This 
        combination will result in only one 
        FrwkFeedbackTrafficUsageEntry to be created which only contains 
        the traffic counters. 
    
      Feedback from all interfaces a filter is assigned to: 
        By combining a frwkFeedbackDPESelectionQueryEntry as selection 
        criteria with the FrwkFeedbackIfTrafficUsage PRC, all the 
        assignments are selected and multiple 
        FrwkFeedbackIfTrafficUsageEntries get created. Each entry not 
        only carries the desired traffic counters but also the 
        qualifying attributes to associate it with the assignment: 
        frwkFeedbackIfTrafficUsageInterface           Prid,  
        frwkFeedbackIfTrafficUsageIfDirection   IfDirection

3 Summary of the Feedback Framework Policy Information Base  
     
3.1 SPPI ACCESS clause report-only    
           
   The selection criteria and linkage policy classes follow the 
   definitions specified by [SPPI]. This structure specifies well-
   defined policy classes and their instances residing in a common, 
   virtual repository [FR-PIB]. The additional PIB-ACCESS clause 
   attribute of "report-only" denotes the usage policy class reported by 
   the PEP.  
    
    
3.2 Feedback Groups and PRCs  
           
   It is useful to define reporting intervals, and suspend, resume, and 
   solicit characteristics as well as the common usage and selection 
   criteria polices. These policy classes are common to account type 
   reporting for various technologies and apply to ALL SUBJECT-
   CATEGORIES. The policy classes are divided into three new groups, 
   namely, The Feedback Report Group, The Feedback Usage Group and The 
   Feedback Selection Group.  
    
   The policy classes in the Feedback Report Group are:  
        
      1) Feedback Action Table   
      2) Feedback Action List Table 
      3) Feedback Selection Usage Combination Capability Table 
      4) Feedback Linkage Table  
    
   The policy classes in the Feedback Usage Group are:  
      1) Feedback Traffic Statistics Usage Table 
      2) Feedback Interface Traffic Statistics Usage Table 
      3) Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold Table 
       
   The policy classes in the Feedback Selection Group are:  
      1) Feedback DPE Selection Criteria Table 
      2) Feedback DPE Selection Query Table 
      3) Feedback DPE Interface Usage Table 
    
    
3.2.1 Feedback Action Table  
    
   The Feedback Action Table contains the attributes that specify 
   action that the PEP is to take regarding policy usage, monitoring 
   and tracking. The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and periodic 
   reporting, suspend periodic reporting only, resume usage and 
   periodic reporting or solicit immediate reporting. The action may 
   affect all feedback policies or be associated with one or more 
   policy instances. 
    
   The Feedback Action Indicator defines the action. The Feedback 
   Specific PRI indicates whether the action applies to all of the

Internet Draft             Feedback-FR-PIB                 March 2002 
 
 
   usage policies or to a list. The Feedback List ID is the identifier 
   of the list of Linkage policy instances to which the action is to be 
   applied. 
    
   The PDP can solicit the PEP for immediate usage feedback. The PEP 
   shall respond with a solicited report containing the usage feedback. 
    
   The PDP can direct the resumption of usage monitoring and reporting 
   per the defined intervals. For example, the PEP may have re-
   connected to a PDP and has cached usage policies. The PDP indicates 
   to the PEP to resume usage tracking and monitoring and to send all 
   the cached usage policy.  The PEP shall respond at the next 
   appropriate interval with an unsolicited report containing the usage 
   feedback. 
    
   The PDP can suspend the monitoring of usage policy. The PEP 
   maintains the current usage that has been monitored but discontinues 
   any further monitoring until the PDP directs the PEP to resume 
   monitoring in a subsequent Decision. 
    
   The PDP can also suspend just the reporting of usage, but not 
   interrupt the monitoring and tracking of usage. The PEP shall 
   discontinue sending Report messages with usage feedback until the 
   PDP directs the PEP to resume. The PEP then begins reporting the 
   usage feedback at the next interval. 
    
        
3.2.2 Feedback List Table 
 
   This table contains a list of PRIDs of the linkage table for which 
   the PDP wants feedback reports. The value is referenced by an 
   attribute in the Feedback Resume Table. There may be one or more 
   instances associated with a specific list identifier defined by the 
   Feedback Action List ID. 
    
3.2.3 The Feedback Selection Usage Combination Capability Table 
    
   This table defines the valid selection criteria PRC, and usage PRC 
   and threshold PRC combinations supported. 
    
3.2.4 The Feedback Report Linkage Table  
     
   This table links the selection criteria instance with the usage 
   instance. It specifies the PRID of the selection criteria and the PRC 
   of the usage instance. This table permits the reuse of a selection 
   criteria instance for multiple usage policies.   
     
   The linkage table also permits the definition of a maximum reporting 
   interval to use when issuing the COPS accounting type reports for the 
   usage instance. This interval is defined in units of the Accounting 
   Timer Interval specified in the client accept message. A value of 0 
   in this attribute indicates that the usage policy must be solicited.

3.2.5 The Feedback Traffic Statistics Usage Table  
  
   This table describes the packet counts, byte counts, last timestamp 
   when a packet was received and the PRID of the associated Feedback 
   Report Linkage instance. The count and timestamp information is 
   monitored and recorded by the PEP and supplied to the PDP with the 
   COPS accounting type report message within the maximum interval 
   specified.  
      
3.2.6 The Feedback Interface Traffic Statistics Usage Table  
 
   This table is similar to the table described above, except that it 
   includes an additional reference to an interface. This table should 
   be used with a selection criteria that matches an element that is 
   assigned to multiple interfaces. The interface field can be used to 
   associate the instances of this table with the specific element∆s 
   assignment. 
    
3.2.7 The Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold Table 
    
   This table is used to provide threshold values for the attributes 
   described in the above usage tables.  
    
    
3.2.8 Feedback DPE Selection Criteria Table 
    
   This table is an example of a Selection Criteria PRC that references 
   a specific instance of a shared object.  
   It is based on the popular model of a data path consisting of 
   multiple linked data path elements (DPEs). 
   A single data path can be assigned to multiple interfaces by a 
   single entry in the Data Path Table [DIFFSERV-PIB], elements within 
   this data path however can collect usage information for each 
   assignment individually. 
    
   Instances of this class allow the PDP to select a specific 
   assignment of a data path element to be selected for usage 
   reporting. This is achieved by the combination of references to a 
   Data Path Entry, a Data Path Element and the Interface.  
   It is expected to be used in combination with the 
   FrwkFeedbackTrafficUsage PRC. 
      
3.2.9 Feedback DPE Selection Query Table 
    
   This Selection Criteria PRC is similar to the DPE Selection Criteria 
   Table, however it is missing the reference to a specific interface. 
   This means an instance of this class can select multiple assignments 
   of a data path element for usage collection. Each selected 
   assignment of the DPE creates its own usage instance. 
   This selection criteria PRC is expected to be used together with a 
   usage PRC that includes the a reference to an interface, so the 
   results can be assigned uniquely.

3.2.11 Feedback DPE Interface Usage Table 
 
   The DPE Interface Usage class is an extension of the generic Traffic 
   Usage class that also includes a reference to a frwkIfRoleComboEntry 
   that represents the interface, this instance is associated with.

5 Security Considerations  
        
     The feedback information is sensitive and requires that authorized 
     messaging occur between the PEP and the PDP. This protection can 
     be accomplished with IPSEC or TLS [COPS-TLS] between the PEP and 
     the PDP or using the security mechanisms described in the base 
     COPS protocol.
