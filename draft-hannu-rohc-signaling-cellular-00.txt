1. Introduction

   Two communication technologies have become commonly used by the
   general public in the recent years: cellular telephony and the
   Internet. Cellular telephony has provided its users with the freedom
   of mobility - the possibility of always being reachable with
   reasonable service quality no matter where they are. However, until
   now the main service provided has been speech. With the Internet, the
   conditions have been almost the opposite. While flexibility for all
   kinds of usage has been its strength, its focus has been on fixed
   connections and large terminals, and the experienced quality of some
   services (such as Internet telephony) has generally been low. Due to
   new enhanced technologies this is about to change. Internet and
   cellular technologies are beginning to merge. Future cellular
   "phones" will contain an IP-stack and support voice over IP in
   addition to web-browsing, e-mail, etc. One could say that the
   Internet is going mobile, or that cellular systems are becoming much
   more than telephony depending on one's point of view.

   Commonly used terms in this technical area are "all-IP" and "IP all
   the way". These terms all relate to the case where IP is used end to
   end, even if the path involves cellular links, and IP is also run
   over the radio hop(s). This is done for all types of traffic, both
   the user data (e.g. voice or streaming) and control signaling data
   (e.g. SIP or RTSP). A great benefit of this is the service
   flexibility introduce by IP combined with the freedom provided by
   continuos mobility. A high cost, on the other hand, is the relative
   large overhead the IP protocol suite typically introduce, e.g. due to
   large headers and text-based signaling protocols.

   It is very important in cellular systems to use the scarce radio
   resources in an efficient way. It must be possible to support a
   sufficient number of users per cell, otherwise costs will be
   prohibitive [CELL]. Frequency spectrum and thus bandwidth are the
   most costly resources in cellular links and must be used carefully.
   Processing power is very cheap in comparison. Implementation or
   computational simplicity is therefore of less importance than
   bandwidth requirements and robustness against errors.

   The ROHC (RObust Header Compression) working group has successfully
   solved the problem of reducing bandwidth requirements for the header
   parts of e.g. RTP/UDP/IP packets. With this obstacle removed, new
   possibilities of enhancing mobile internet performance arise. One of
   these relates to application signaling protocols. Protocols such as
   SIP [SIP], SDP [SDP] and RTSP [RTSP] will typically be used to setup
   and control applications also in a mobile Internet. However, the
   protocol messages are generous in size and create delays due to their
   request/response nature. Compression of these messages should be
   considered in order to increase spectrum efficiency and reduce
   transmission delay.

2. Protocol characteristics

   The following application signaling protocols are the subject of
   study in this draft.

2.1 SIP

   The Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] is an application layer
   protocol for establishing, modifying and terminating multimedia
   sessions or calls. These sessions include Internet multimedia
   conferences, Internet telephony and similar applications. SIP can be
   used over either TCP [TCP] or UDP [UDP]. SIP is a text based
   protocol, using ISO 10646 in UTF-8 encoding.

2.2 SDP

   The Session Description Protocol [SDP] is used to advertise
   multimedia conferences and communicate conference addresses and
   conference tool specific information. It is also used for general
   real-time multimedia session description purposes. SDP is carried in
   the message body of SIP and RTSP messages. SDP is text based using
   the ISO 10646 character set in UTF-8 encoding.

2.3 RTSP

   The Real Time Streaming Protocol [RTSP] is an application level
   protocol for controlling delivery of data with real-time properties,
   such as audio and video. RTSP may use UDP or TCP (or other) as
   transport protocol. RTSP is text based using the ISO 10646 character
   set in UTF-8 encoding.

2.4 Protocol similarities

   The above protocols have many similarities. These similarities will
   have implications on solutions to the problems they create in
   conjunction with the cellular radio access. The similarities include:

   -Requests and reply characteristics. When a sender sends a request,
    it stays idle until it has received a response. Hence, it typically
    takes a number of round trip times to conclude e.g. a SIP session.

   -They are ASCII based. Thus to represent e.g. the value 230, 3 * 8 =
    24 bits are used. A binary representation of the same value, by
    comparison, would require only 8 bits.

   -They are generous in size in order to provide the necessary
    information to the session participants.

   -SIP and RTSP share many common methods, status codes and header
    field names.

INTERNET-DRAFT Application signaling over cellular links   Nov 17, 2000



   -The traffic patterns are also similar. The signaling is carried out
    primarily under the set up phase. For SIP this means that the
    majority of the signaling is carried out to set up a phone call or
    multimedia session. For RTSP the majority of the signaling is done
    before the transmission of application data.

3. Cellular system radio characteristics

   Partly to enable high utilization of cellular systems and partly due
   to the unreliable nature of the radio media, cellular links have
   characteristics that differ somewhat from a typical fixed link, e.g.
   copper or fiber. The most important characteristics are the lossy
   behavior of cellular links and the large round trip times.

   The quality in a radio system typically changes from one radio frame
   to another due to fading in the radio channel. Due to the nature of
   the radio media and interference from other radio users, the average
   bit error rate (BER) can be 10e-3 with a variation roughly between
   10e-2 to 10e-4. To be able to use the radio media with its error
   characteristics, methods such as forward error correction (FEC) and
   interleaving are used. If these methods were not used, the BER of a
   cellular radio channel would be around 10 % [CELL]. Thus, radio links
   are by nature error prone. The final packet loss rate may be further
   reduced by applying low level retransmissions (ARQ) over the radio
   channel; this, however, trades decreased packet loss rate for a
   larger delay.

   By applying methods to decrease BER, the system delay is increased.
   In some cellular systems, the algorithmic channel round trip delay is
   in the order of  80 ms. Other sources of delays are DSP-processing,
   node-internal delay and transmission. A general value for the RTT is
   difficult to state, but, to give one example, 200 ms is mentioned in
   [CELL].

   For cellular systems it is of vital importance to have a sufficient
   number of users per cell; otherwise the system cost would prohibit
   deployment. It is crucial to use the existing bandwidth carefully;
   hence the average user bit rate is typically relatively low compared
   to the average user bit rate in wired line systems. This is
   especially important for mass market services like voice.

4. Problem description

   The characteristics of cellular systems and the existing signaling
   protocols will together cause some problems.

4.1 General

   Figure 4.1 shows the scenario. The mobile uses Internet protocols for
   control of streaming flows, i.e. RTSP, and SIP for initiation of
   multimedia sessions. The characteristics of the cellular link with a
   limited user bit rate and fairly long system RTT cause a long call
   setup time with SIP and a long control time with RTSP because of
   their protocol characteristics. A numerical example is provided in
   the next section.

                           Figure 4.1. Scenario.

4.2 Numerical example

   Figure 4.2 shows an example of SIP signaling between two terminals
   and the resulting delay under certain system assumptions.

   It should be noted that the used figures represent a very narrow band
   link even if e.g. a WCDMA system can provide maximum bit rates up to
   2 Mbits/s in ideal conditions. However, this requires that one user
   consumes all radio resources in a cell. For a mass market service
   such as voice, it is always crucial to reduce the bandwidth
   requirements for each user.

   The delay is calculated according to the following equation:

   Delay = n * BlockTransmissionDelay + RTT / 2   (eq. 1)

   where

   n = MessageSize / BlockSize               

   The following values have been used:

   RTT/2:                     70 ms
   BlockSize:                 12 Bytes
   BlockTransmissionDelay:    10 ms

INTERNET-DRAFT Application signaling over cellular links   Nov 17, 2000


   This BlockSize corresponds to a bit rate of 9.6 kbps. The delay
   formula is based on an approximation of a WCDMA radio access method
   for speech services. The approximation is rather crude. For instance,
   delays caused by possible retransmissions due to errors are ignored.
   Further, these calculations also assume that there is only one
   cellular link in the path and also take delays in an eventual
   intermediate IP-network into account. Even if this approximation is
   crude, it is still sufficient to provide representative numbers and
   enable comparisons.

   Figure 4.2. SIP signaling.

   Applying equation 1 on the example shown in Figure 4.2 gives a total
   delay of 3087 ms from the first SIP message to the last.

   Thus, solutions are needed to reduce signaling delay and required
   bandwidth when considering both system bandwidth requirements and
   service setup delays.

5. Possible solutions

   More or less attractive solutions of the previously mentioned
   problems can be outlined:

   * Increase the user bit rate.

   An increase of the bit rate per user will decrease the number of
   users per cell. There exist systems (for example WCDMA) which can




Hannu, Christoffersson, Svanbro                                 [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT Application signaling over cellular links   Nov 17, 2000


   provide high bit rates and even variable rates for instance at setup
   of new sessions. However, there are also systems, e.g. GSM/EDGE,
   where it is not possible to reach these high bit rates in all
   situations. At the cell borders, for example, the signal strength to
   noise ratio will be lower and result in a lower bit rate. In general,
   an unnecessary increase of the bit rate should be avoided due to the
   higher system cost introduced and the possibility of denial of
   service. The latter could for example be caused by lack of enough
   bandwidth to support sending of the large setup message within a
   required time period, which is set for QoS reasons.

   * Decrease the RTT of the cellular link

   Decreasing the RTT would require substantial system changes and is
   thus not feasible. Further, the RTT-delay due to interleaving and FEC
   will always have to be present regardless of which system is used.
   Otherwise the BER will be too high for the received data to be
   useful, or alternatively trigger retransmissions giving an average
   total delay of the same or higher magnitude.

   * Optimize message sequence for the protocols.

   If the request/response pattern could be eased up, then "keeping the
   pipe full" could be a way forward. Thus, instead of following the
   message sequence described in figure 4.2, more than one message would
   be sent in row, even though no response has been received. However,
   this would entail protocol changes and may be difficult at current
   date.

   * Protocol stripping.

   Removing fields from a message would decrease the size of the
   messages to some extent. However, this would cause loss of
   transparency and thus violate the End-to-End principle and is thus
   not desirable.

   * Compression.

   By compressing messages, the impact of the mentioned problems could
   be decreased. There is no requirement on compression on a per-hop
   basis. However, the flow must pass through the same entities where
   the compressor/decompressor resides during the session. The entities
   must also be aware of each other and as for header compression be
   able to negotiate that compression should be done. Thus, compression
   on a per-hop basis seems to be rather natural.
   With a compression factor (uncompressed/compressed) of e.g. 3 in the
   example considered in Section 4.2, the call setup time would decrease
   from 3087 ms to 1449 ms. The transparency problem would not be an
   issue if the compression scheme was carefully designed, so the scheme
   should be fully transparent.

6. General description of proposed compression method

   An important feature needed in order for the proposed compression
   algorithm to be efficient and useful is a method to classify and
   separate flows, that is, a method for identifying the protocol type
   which is carried on top of IP/UDP or IP/TCP.

   This is a non elementary problem. One solution could be to look for
   certain protocol characteristic into the data transported by UDP or
   TCP. However, how to do this fast and reliable might be a problem.

6.1 Existing compression methods

   Different approaches for compression of the protocol messages are
   possible.

6.1.1 Field compression

   Compression of the messages could be done using field compression
   methods such as ROHC. Field compression methods are based on
   knowledge of the syntax of a specific protocol. Field compression is
   successful when applied to protocols where many header fields are
   either static, are dependent on other header fields in the same
   packet or change in a predictable way between consecutive packets.

6.1.2 Binary compression

   Several binary compression algorithms are in use for general data
   file compression. These could possibly be used for the protocol
   compression discussed here.

   Huffman compression [HUFF] is a general method intended primarily for
   compression of ASCII files. Characters occurring frequently in the
   file are replaced by shorter codes, i.e. codes with less than the 8
   bits used by the ASCII code. Huffman compression can be successful in
   files where relatively few characters are used. The first step when
   applying Huffman compression is to determine the new codes for the
   particular file being compressed. This code must also be used when
   decompressing the file. It is possible to use a fixed code for a
   sequence of messages; however, this would not give an optimal code
   for the specific message being compressed.

   Another widely used compression algorithm is the Lempel-Ziv [LZ77]
   algorithm. This algorithm operates by replacing character strings
   which have previously occurred in the file by references to the
   previous occurrence. This method is successful in files where
   repeated strings are common. This algorithm does not require any code
   to be sent to the decompressor.






Hannu, Christoffersson, Svanbro                                 [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT Application signaling over cellular links   Nov 17, 2000


   The well known compression programs Gzip and WinZip both use Lempel-
   Ziv compression followed by Huffman compression.

6.1.3 IPComp

   IPComp [IPComp] is a compression protocol for compression of IP [IP]
   payload and could hence be used for compression of SIP, SDP and RTSP.
   The protocol can use different compression methods, e.g. Lempel-Ziv,
   for the actual compression. The IPComp protocol specifies that each
   datagram is compressed independently of other datagrams. This is to
   ensure that received packets can be decompressed even if some
   previous packets are lost.

6.2 Drawbacks with existing compression methods

   Using field compression  would be difficult or impossible since the
   studied protocols are similar to payload of IP/UDP and do not have
   any fixed header fields in a strict sense. That is, different
   protocol messages will have different fields with varying length.

   A general prerequisite for successful compression using the above
   mentioned binary compression algorithms is that the file to be
   compressed is reasonably large, i.e. several kilobytes. This is a
   consequence of the compression algorithms. The codes for Huffman
   compression must not be too large compared to the file which is being
   compressed and the file must be large enough to have many repeated
   strings so that Lempel-Ziv compression becomes efficient. The
   messages produced by the protocols considered here are mostly a
   couple of hundred bytes and definitely not large enough to allow
   efficient compression with the mentioned algorithms on a message-by-
   message basis.

   IPComp compresses each datagram by itself without any relation to any
   other datagrams. This implies that efficient compression of these
   protocol messages using IPComp is not feasible.

6.3 Description of proposed solution

   The proposed solution is a framework which is robust to packet loss
   and will give efficient compression of messages. The approach taken
   here, is to compress the messages sequentially using previous
   messages from the same session. The compression algorithm used for
   compression is some, perhaps modified, version of the Lempel-Ziv
   algorithm. By appending a message to a previous message (dictionary),
   it becomes possible to replace strings in the message by references
   to occurrences in the previous messages.

   Updating of the dictionary can be done in different ways:







Hannu, Christoffersson, Svanbro                                [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT Application signaling over cellular links   Nov 17, 2000


   *Append all new messages to the dictionary. This will increase the
    size of the dictionary throughout the session. In long sessions
    with large messages, the dictionary size might cause problems.

   *Append only new strings to the dictionary. This will also make the
    dictionary increase in size throughout the session, but at a slower
    rate.

   *Limit the size of the dictionary by keeping only the n most
    recently transmitted messages. This means that when the n+1 message
    of the session is appended to the dictionary, the first is removed.

   *Limit the size by using a sliding window of some predefined size.
    When a message appended to the dictionary makes the dictionary size
    exceed the window size by, say, x bytes, x bytes are removed from
    the beginning of the dictionary.

   Of course, a combination of these techniques is possible.

   The first message of the session does not have any previous message
   to use as dictionary. To compress this message efficiently a static
   dictionary can be used containing strings that can be expected to
   occur, such as protocol field names, protocol token method, header
   field names, etc. This part of the dictionary should be kept during
   the entire session

   A potential difficulty with binary compression based on previous
   messages is how to obtain robustness to packet loss. It is essential
   that the message is decompressed using the same dictionary as the
   message was compressed with, otherwise the decompression will fail.
   Thus, a sent message can not be used to compress further messages
   until it is known that the message has been received at the other
   entity. This can be solved in different ways:

   *Entity 2 can send an acknowledgement to entity 1 that it has
    received a message and entity 1 can then use this message to
    compress new messages, see Figure 6.1. However, this is not
    necessary considering that the protocols (mostly) have a strict
    request/response pattern.

   *If the compressor and the decompressor at one entity can
    communicate, then a header is appended to the compressed message.
    The header holds an identification number for the compressed
    message and an indication of which previous messages that have been
    received. Thus, no extra Acknowledgement message is needed. When
    this message is received by the decompressor the information in the
    header is passed to the compressor at the same entity, which then
    can use the indicated previous messages to improve the compression
    efficiency, see Figure 6.2.

   entity 2 indicates in its message header that it has received m1.

   The scheme can be made even more efficient. If the compressor and
   decompressor at one entity can communicate and also share the
   dictionary (shared context), received messages, too, can be used to
   compress new messages. The received message can always be used as
   dictionary since it is certain that the message is known at the other
   entity. This is shown in Figure 6.3.

6.4 Compression efficiency

   Compression efficiency of the proposed method depends among other
   things on the protocol type and the number of messages the session
   consists of. The first message will not be compressed very much, but
   the following messages will be compressed considerably. Some initial
   tests using the LZSS [LZSS] algorithm in the described compression
   scheme with shared context have indicated compression factors
   (original message size / compressed message size) of around 1.6 for
   the first message and 5-7 for messages at the end of the sessions.
   The over all compression factors of all the messages in the sessions
   taken together have been around 3-4.

   If the messages in the session of Figure 4.2. are compressed using
   the proposed compression algorithm (Figure 6.2) an over all
   compression factor of 4.4 is obtained. The individual messages are
   compressed in the range 1.7 to 8.5. Using the approximation of the
   delay in Section 3, with the compressed message sizes, a delay of
   1180 ms was obtained - a reduction with almost 2/3 compared to the
   uncompressed case.

7. Relation to header compression

   A packet consists not only of application headers and application
   data, but also transport and network headers. Thus, attention should
   be paid to UDP/IP or TCP/IP as well.

   One suggestion could be to note that the first part of the packet is
   UDP/IP or TCP/IP and the second part is e.g. SIP/SDP. Thus, the first
   part is handled by e.g. ROHC and the second part is compressed by
   some method similar to the one described in this draft. However, this
   requires a method to separate signaling flows from ordinary UDP/IP
   and TCP/IP flows: see Chapter 6. Although virtually any protocol data
   could be compressed with this method, compression would not be
   efficient for other protocols that are not ASCII-based. Figure 7.1.
   shows a packet before and after compression. CMP is compressed
   information e.g. SIP, B is the possible header of the method handling
   the compression of the second part of the packet, and R is the ROHC
   header handling the first part of the packet.

   To identify that a message has been compressed with a method, such as
   the one described in this draft, there are some alternatives
   depending on the environment. For example, a link layer
   identification method could be used, or in conjunction with ROHC, a
   profile number.

8. Conclusions

   This draft has identified an important problem which needs to be
   addressed. Using ASCII based signaling and control protocols over
   cellular access channels will result in long call setup times and
   long control times.

   Various possible solutions have been considered, such as increasing
   the user bit rate, shortening of the round trip time, optimizing
   message sequences or stripping the protocols. These methods, even if
   implementable, would lead to increased costs, changes of either
   systems or protocols or not be transparent. However, the proposed
   method seems to offer a tractable solution.

   A method for sequential binary compression of SIP and RTSP sessions
   has been described which is promising in terms of compression
   efficiency and hence gives a substantial reduction in delay or needed
   bandwidth.

   Even though only SIP, SDP and RTSP are studied in this draft, the
   proposed compression method could be extended to other ASCII based
   protocols with similar characteristics, such as HTTP [HTTP].

9. Security considerations

   This draft has discussed problems of some signaling protocols in the
   context of cellular system characteristics and requires no detailed
   security considerations at the present time. It should, however, be
   noted that encryption of e.g. SIP-data does not make the compression
   scheme outlined in this draft impossible in the same manner as
   encryption makes e.g. header compression impossible. However,
   encryption does make the outlined compression scheme much less
   efficient, since a static dictionary can not be used.

10. Intellectual property rights considerations

   Ericsson has filed patent applications that might possibly have
   technical relations to this contribution.
