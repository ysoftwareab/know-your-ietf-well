Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios       December 2007


1.  Introduction

   As the deployment of IEEE 802.16 access networks progresses, users
   will be connected to IPv6 networks.  While the IEEE 802.16 standard
   defines the encapsulation of an IPv4/IPv6 datagram in an IEEE 802.16
   MAC payload, a complete description of IPv4/IPv6 operation and
   deployment is not present.  The IEEE 802.16 standards are limited to
   L1 and L2, so they may be used within any number of IP network
   architectures and scenarios.  In this document, we will discuss main
   components of IPv6 IEEE 802.16 access networks and their differences
   from IPv4 IEEE 802.16 networks and how IPv6 is deployed and
   integrated in each of the IEEE 802.16 technologies.

   This document extends the work of [RFC4779] and follows the structure
   and common terminology of that document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The IEEE 802.16 related terminologies in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [I-D.ietf-16ng-ps-goals].
   o  Subscriber Station (SS): An end-user equipment that provides
      connectivity to the 802.16 networks.  It can be either fixed/
      nomadic or mobile equipment.  In mobile environment, SS represents
      the Mobile Subscriber Station (MS) introduced in [IEEE802.16e].
   o  Base Station (BS): A generalized equipment sets providing
      connectivity, management, and control between the subscriber
      station and the 802.16 networks.
   o  Access Router (AR): An entity that performs an IP routing function
      to provide IP connectivity for subscriber station (SS or MS).
   o  Connection Identifier (CID): A 16-bit value that identifies a
      connection to equivalent peers in the 802.16 MAC of the SS(MS) and
      BS.
   o  Ethernet CS (Convergence Sublayer): 802.3/Ethernet CS specific
      part of the Packet CS defined in 802.16 STD.
   o  IPv6 CS (Convergence Sublayer): IPv6 specific subpart of the
      Packet CS, Classifier 2 (Packet, IPv6) defined in 802.16 STD.


2.  Deploying IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks

2.1.  Elements of IEEE 802.16 Networks

   The mechanism of transporting IP traffic over IEEE 802.16 networks is
   outlined in [IEEE802.16].  [IEEE802.16] only specifies the
   convergence sublayers and the ability to transport IP over the air
   interface.  The details of IPv6 (and IPv4) operations over IEEE
   802.16 are being discussed now in the 16ng WG.

2.2.  Scenarios and IPv6 Deployment

   [IEEE802.16] specifies two modes for sharing the wireless medium:
   point-to-multipoint (PMP) and mesh (optional).  This document only
   focuses on the PMP mode.

   Some of the factors that hinder deployment of native IPv6 core
   protocols are already introduced by [I-D.ietf-16ng-ps-goals].

   There are two different deployment scenarios: fixed and mobile access
   deployment scenarios.  A fixed access scenario substitutes for
   existing wired-based access technologies such as digital subscriber
   lines (xDSL) and cable networks.  This fixed access scenario can
   provide nomadic access within the radio coverages, which is called
   Hot-zone model.  A mobile access scenario exists for the new paradigm
   of transmitting voice, data and video over mobile networks.  This
   scenario can provide high speed data rates equivalent to the wire-
   based Internet as well as mobility functions equivalent to cellular
   systems.  There are the different IPv6 impacts on convergence
   sublayer type, link model, addressing, mobility, etc. between fixed
   and mobile access deployment scenarios.  The details will be
   discussed below.  The mobile access scenario can be classified into
   two different IPv6 link models: shared IPv6 prefix link model and
   point-to-point link model.

2.2.1.  Mobile Access Deployment Scenarios

   Unlike IEEE 802.11, the IEEE 802.16 BS can provide mobility functions
   and fixed communications.  [IEEE802.16e] has been standardized to
   provide mobility features on IEEE 802.16 environments.  IEEE 802.16



Shin, Ed., et al.         Expires June 22, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios       December 2007


   BS might be deployed with a proprietary backend managed by an
   operator.  Some architectural characteristics of IEEE 802.16 networks
   may affect the detailed operations of NDP (Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol) [RFC4861], [RFC4862].

   There are two possible IPv6 link models for mobile access deployment
   scenarios: shared IPv6 prefix link model and point-to-point link
   model [RFC4968].  There is always a default access router in the
   scenarios.  There can exist multiple hosts behind an MS (networks
   behind an MS may exist).  The mobile access deployment models, Mobile
   WiMax and WiBro, fall within this deployment model.

   1.  Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model

   This link model represents the IEEE 802.16 mobile access network
   deployment where a subnet consists of only single AR interfaces and
   multiple MSs.  Therefore, all MSs and corresponding AR interfaces
   share the same IPv6 prefix as shown in Figure 2.  The IPv6 prefix
   will be different from the interface of the AR.

     | MS4 |<-(16)-+
     +-----+

                  Figure 2: Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model

   2.  Point-to-Point Link Model

   This link model represents IEEE 802.16 mobile access network
   deployments where a subnet consists of only single AR, BS and MS.
   That is, each connection to a mobile node is treated as a single
   link.  Each link between the MS and the AR is allocated a separate,
   unique prefix or unique set of prefixes by the AR.  The point-to-
   point link model follows the recommendations of [RFC3314].

                    Figure 3: Point-to-Point Link Model

2.2.1.1.  IPv6 Related Infrastructure Changes

   IPv6 will be deployed in this scenario by upgrading the following
   devices to dual-stack: MS, AR and ER.  In this scenario, IEEE 802.16
   BSs have only MAC and PHY layers without router functionality and
   operate as a bridge.  The BS should support IPv6 classifiers as
   specified in [IEEE802.16].  However, if IPv4 stack is loaded to them
   for management and configuration purposes, it is expected that BS
   should be upgraded by implementing IPv6 stack, too.

2.2.1.2.  Addressing

   An IPv6 MS has two possible options to get an IPv6 address.  These
   options will be equally applied to the other scenario below (Section
   2.2.2).

   1.  An IPv6 MS can get the IPv6 address from an access router using
   stateless auto-configuration.  In this case, router discovery and DAD
   operation should be properly operated over an IEEE 802.16 link.

   2.  An IPv6 MS can use DHCPv6 to get an IPv6 address from the DHCPv6
   server.  In this case, the DHCPv6 server would be located in the
   service provider core network and the AR should provide a DHCPv6
   relay agent.  This option is similar to what we do today in case of
   DHCPv4.

   In this scenario, a router and multiple BSs form an IPv6 subnet and a
   single prefix is allocated to all the attached MSs.  All MSs attached
   to same AR can be on the same IPv6 link.

   As for the prefix assignment, in case of the shared IPv6 prefix link
   model, one or more IPv6 prefixes are assigned to the link and hence



Shin, Ed., et al.         Expires June 22, 2008                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios       December 2007


   shared by all the nodes that are attached to the link.  In the point-
   to-point link model, the AR assigns a unique prefix or a set of
   unique prefixes for each MS.  Prefix delegation can be required if
   networks exist behind an MS.

2.2.1.3.  IPv6 Transport

   In an IPv6 subnet, there are always two underlying links: one is the
   IEEE 802.16 wireless link between the MS and BS, and the other is a
   wired link between the BS and AR.

   If stateless auto-configuration is used to get an IPv6 address,
   router discovery and DAD operation should be properly operated over
   IEEE 802.16 links.  In case of the shared IPv6 prefix link model, the
   DAD (Duplicate Address Detection) [RFC4861] does not adapt well to
   the 802.16 air interface as there is no native multicast support.  An
   optimization, called Relay DAD, may be required to perform DAD.
   However, in case of the point-to-point link model, DAD is easy since
   each connection to a MN is treated as a unique IPv6 link.

   Note that in this scenario IPv6 CS [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs]
   may be more appropriate than Ethernet CS [I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-
   ethernet-over-802.16] to transport IPv6 packets, since there is some
   overhead of Ethernet CS (e.g., Ethernet header) under mobile access
   environments.  However, when PHS (Payload Header Suppression) is
   deployed it mitigates this overhead through the compression of packet
   headers.

   Simple or complex network equipment may constitute the underlying
   wired network between the AR and the ER.  If the IP-aware equipment
   between the AR and the ER does not support IPv6, the service
   providers can deploy IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling mechanisms to transport
   IPv6 packets between the AR and the ER.

   The service providers are deploying tunneling mechanisms to transport
   IPv6 over their existing IPv4 networks as well as deploying native
   IPv6 where possible.  Native IPv6 should be preferred over tunneling
   mechanisms as native IPv6 deployment options might be more scalable
   and provide the required service performance.  Tunneling mechanisms
   should only be used when native IPv6 deployment is not an option.
   This can be equally applied to other scenarios below (Section 2.2.2).

2.2.1.4.  Routing

   In general, the MS is configured with a default route that points to
   the AR.  Therefore, no routing protocols are needed on the MS.  The
   MS just sends to the AR using the default route.




Shin, Ed., et al.         Expires June 22, 2008                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios       December 2007


   The AR can configure multiple links to ER for network reliability.
   The AR should support IPv6 routing protocols such as OSPFv3 [RFC2740]
   or IS-IS for IPv6 when connected to the ER with multiple links.

   The ER runs the IGP such as OSPFv3 or IS-IS for IPv6 in the service
   provider network.  The routing information of the ER can be
   redistributed to the AR.  Prefix summarization should be done at the
   ER.

2.2.1.5.  Mobility

   As for mobility management, the movement between BSs is handled by
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], if it requires a subnet change.  Also, in
   certain cases (e.g., fast handover) the link mobility information
   must be available for facilitating the layer 3 handoff procedure.

   Mobile IPv6 defines that movement detection uses Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection to detect when the default router is no
   longer bidirectionally reachable, in which case the mobile node must
   discover a new default router.  Periodic Router Advertisements for
   reachability and movement detection may be unnecessary because the
   IEEE 802.16 MAC provides the reachability by its Ranging procedure
   and the movement detection by the Handoff procedure.

   IEEE 802.16 defines L2 triggers in case the refresh of an IP address
   is required during the handoff.  Though a handoff has occurred, an
   additional router discovery procedure is not required in case of
   intra-subnet handoff.  Also, faster handoff may occur by the L2
   trigger in case of inter-subnet handoff.

   Also, [IEEE802.16g] defines L2 triggers for link status such as
   link-up, link-down, handoff-start.  These L2 triggers may make the
   Mobile IPv6 procedure more efficient and faster.  In addition, Mobile
   IPv6 Fast Handover assumes the support from link- layer technology,
   but the particular link-layer information being available, as well as
   the timing of its availability (before, during or after a handover
   has occurred), differs according to the particular link-layer
   technology in use.  This issue is also being discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fh80216e].

   In addition, due to the problems caused by the existence of multiple
   convergence sublayers [RFC4840], the mobile access scenarios need
   solutions about how roaming will work when forced to move from one CS
   to another (e.g., IPv6 CS to Ethernet CS).  Note that, at this phase
   this issue is the out of scope of this document.  It should be also
   discussed in the 16ng WG.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios       December 2007


2.2.2.  Fixed/Nomadic Deployment Scenarios

   The IEEE 802.16 access networks can provide plain Ethernet end-to-end
   connectivity.  Wireless DSL deployment model is an example of a
   fixed/nomadic IPv6 deployment of IEEE 802.16.  Many wireless Internet
   service providers (Wireless ISPs) have planned to use IEEE 802.16 for
   the purpose of high quality broadband wireless services.  A company
   can use IEEE 802.16 to build up a mobile office.  Wireless Internet
   spreading through a campus or a cafe can be also implemented with it.
   The distinct point of this use case is that it can use the unlicensed
   (2.4 & 5 GHz) band as well as the licensed (2.6 & 3.5GHz) band.  By
   using the unlicensed band, an IEEE 802.16 BS might be used just as a
   wireless switch/hub which a user purchases to build a private
   wireless network in his/her home or laboratory.

   Under fixed access model, the IEEE 802.16 BS will be deployed using
   an IP backbone rather than a proprietary backend like cellular
   systems.  Thus, many IPv6 functionalities such as [RFC4861],
   [RFC4862] will be preserved when adopting IPv6 to IEEE 802.16
   devices.

   subnet consists of multiple MSs and multiple interfaces of the
   multiple BSs.  Multiple access routers can exist.  There exist
   multiple hosts behind an SS (networks behind an SS may exist).  When
   802.16 access networks are widely deployed as in a WLAN, this case
   should be also considered.  The Hot-zone deployment model falls
   within this case.

   While Figure 4 illustrates a generic deployment scenario, the
   following Figure 5 shows in more detail how an existing DSL ISP would
   integrate the 802.16 access network into its existing infrastructure.

      Figure 5: Integration of 802.16 access into DSL infrastructure

   In this approach the 802.16 BS is acting as a DSLAM (Digital
   Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer).  On the network side, the BS is
   connected to an Ethernet bridge which can be separate equipment or
   integrated into the BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server).

2.2.2.1.  IPv6 Related Infrastructure Changes

   IPv6 will be deployed in this scenario by upgrading the following
   devices to dual-stack: MS, AR, ER, and the Ethernet Bridge.  The BS
   should support IPv6 classifiers as specified in [IEEE802.16].
   However, if a IPv4 stack is loaded to them for management and
   configuration purpose, it is expected that the BS should be upgraded
   by implementing an IPv6 stack, too.

   The BRAS in Figure 5 is providing the functionality of the AR.  An
   Ethernet bridge is necessary for protecting the BRAS from 802.16 link
   layer peculiarities.  The Ethernet bridge relays all traffic received
   through the BS to its network side port(s) connected to the BRAS.
   Any traffic received from the BRAS is relayed to the appropriate BS.
   Since the 802.16 MAC layer has no native support for multicast (and
   broadcast) in the uplink direction, the Ethernet bridge will
   implement multicast (and broadcast) by relaying the multicast frame
   received from the MS to all of its ports.  The Ethernet bridge may
   also provide some IPv6 specific functions to increase link efficiency
   of the 802.16 radio link (see Section 2.2.2.3).

2.2.2.2.  Addressing

   One or more IPv6 prefixes can be shared to all the attached MSs.
   Prefix delegation can be required if networks exist behind the SS.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios       December 2007


2.2.2.3.  IPv6 Transport

   Note that in this scenario Ethernet CS
   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-ethernet-over-802.16] may be more appropriate
   than IPv6 CS [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs] to transport IPv6
   packets, since the scenario needs to support plain Ethernet end-to-
   end connectivity.  However, the IPv6 CS can also be supported.  The
   MS and BS will consider the connections between the peer IP CSs at
   the MS and BS to form a point to point link.  In the Ethernet CS
   case, an Ethernet bridge may provide implementation of an
   authoritative address cache and Relay DAD.  An Authoritative address
   cache is a mapping between the IPv6 address and the MAC addresses of
   all attached MSs.

   The bridge builds its authoritative address cache by parsing the IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery messages used during address configuration (DAD).
   Relay DAD means that the Neighbor Solicitation message used in the
   DAD process will be relayed only to the MS which already has
   configured the solicited address as its own address (if such an MS
   exist at all).

2.2.2.4.  Routing

   In this scenario, IPv6 multi-homing considerations exist.  For
   example, if there exist two routers to support MSs, a default router
   must be selected.

   The Edge Router runs the IGP used in the SP network such as OSPFv3
   [RFC2740] or IS-IS for IPv6.  The connected prefixes have to be
   redistributed.  Prefix summarization should be done at the Edge
   Router.

2.2.2.5.  Mobility

   No mobility functions are supported in the fixed access scenario.
   However, mobility can be supported in the radio coverage without any
   mobility protocol like WLAN technology.  Therefore, a user can access
   Internet nomadically in the coverage.

2.3.  IPv6 Multicast

   In IEEE 802.16 air link, downlink connections can be shared among
   multiple MSs, enabling multicast channels with multiple MSs receiving
   the same information from the BS.  Multicast and Broadcast Service
   (MBS) may be used to efficiently implement multicast.  However, it is
   not clear how to do this, as currently CID is assigned by BS, but in
   MBS it should be done at an AR and it's network scope.  It is not
   clear how this mapping will happen for MBS, so MBS discussions have

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios       December 2007


   been postponed in WiMax for now.  Note that it should be intensively
   researched later, since MBS will be one of the killer services in
   IEEE 802.16 networks.

   In order to support multicast services in IEEE 802.16, Multicast
   Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC2710] must be supported between the MS
   and AR.  Also, the inter-working with IP multicast protocols and MBS
   should be considered.

   MBS defines Multicast and Broadcast Services, but actually, MBS seems
   to be a broadcast service, not multicasting.  MBS adheres to
   broadcast services, while traditional IP multicast schemes define
   multicast routing using a shared tree or source-specific tree to
   deliver packets efficiently.

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, two types of access to MBS may be supported:
   single-BS access and multi-BS access.  Therefore, these two types of
   services may be roughly mapped into Source-Specific Multicast.

2.4.  IPv6 QoS

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, a connection is unidirectional and has a QoS
   specification.  The 802.16 supported QoS has different semantics from
   IP QoS (e.g., diffserv).  Mapping CID to Service Flow IDentifier
   (SFID) defines QoS parameters of the service flow associated with
   that connection.  In order to interwork with IP QoS, IP QoS (e.g.,
   diffserv, or flow label for IPv6) mapping to IEEE 802.16 link
   specifics should be provided.

2.5.  IPv6 Security

   When initiating the connection, an MS is authenticated by the AAA
   server located at its service provider network.  All the parameters
   related to authentication (username, password and etc.) are forwarded
   by the BS to the AAA server.  The AAA server authenticates the MSs
   and when an MS is once authenticated and associated successfully with
   BS, IPv6 an address will be acquired by the MS through stateless
   autoconfiguration or DHCPv6.  Note the initiation and authentication
   process is the same as used in IPv4.

   IPsec is a fundamental part of IPv6.  Unlike IPv4, IPsec for IPv6 may
   be used within the global end-to-end architecture.  But, we do not
   have PKIs across organizations and IPsec is not integrated with IEEE
   802.16 network mobility management.

   IEEE 802.16 network threats may be different from IPv6 and IPv6
   transition threat models [RFC4942].  It should be also discussed.

2.6.  IPv6 Network Management

   [IEEE802.16f] includes the management information base for IEEE
   802.16 networks.  For IPv6 network management, the necessary
   instrumentation (such as MIBs, NetFlow Records, etc) should be
   available.

   Upon entering the network, an MS is assigned three management
   connections in each direction.  These three connections reflect the
   three different QoS requirements used by different management levels.
   The first of these is the basic connection, which is used for the
   transfer of short, time-critical MAC management messages and radio
   link control (RLC) messages.  The primary management connection is
   used to transfer longer, more delay-tolerant messages such as those
   used for authentication and connection setup.  The secondary
   management connection is used for the transfer of standards-based
   management messages such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).

   IPv6 based IEEE 802.16 networks can be managed by IPv4 or IPv6 when
   network elements are implemented dual stack.  For example, network
   management systems (NMS) can send SNMP messages by IPv4 with IPv6
   related object identifiers.  Also, an NMS can use IPv6 for SNMP
   requests and responses including IPv4 related OID.
