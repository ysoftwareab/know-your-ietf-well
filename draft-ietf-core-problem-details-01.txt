                     Problem Details For CoAP APIs
                   draft-ietf-core-problem-details-01

Abstract

   This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-
   readable details of errors in a CoAP response to avoid the need to
   define new error response formats for CoAP APIs.  The proposed format
   is inspired by the Problem Details for HTTP APIs defined in RFC 7807.

1.  Introduction

   CoAP [RFC7252] response codes are sometimes not sufficient to convey
   enough information about an error to be helpful.  This specification
   defines a simple and extensible CoRAL [I-D.ietf-core-coral]
   vocabulary to suit this purpose.  It is designed to be reused by CoAP
   APIs, which can identify distinct "problem types" specific to their
   needs.  Thus, API clients can be informed of both the high-level
   error class (using the response code) and the finer-grained details
   of the problem (using this vocabulary), as shown in Figure 1.

                         Figure 1: Problem Details

   The vocabulary presented is largely inspired by the Problem Details
   for HTTP APIs defined in [RFC7807].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Basic Problem Details

   A CoAP Problem Details is a CoRAL document with the following
   elements:

   *  "type" (id) - The problem type.  This is a mandatory element.

   *  "title" (text) - A short, human-readable summary of the problem
      type.  It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the
      problem.

   *  "detail" (text) - A human-readable explanation specific to this
      occurrence of the problem.

   *  "instance" (uri) - A URI reference that identifies the specific
      occurrence of the problem.  It may or may not yield further
      information if dereferenced.

   Consumers MUST use "type" as primary identifiers for the problem
   type; the "title" string is advisory and included only for consumers
   who are not aware of the semantics of the "type" value.

   The "detail" member, if present, ought to focus on helping the client
   correct the problem, rather than giving debugging information.
   Consumers SHOULD NOT parse the "detail" member for information;
   extensions (see Section 3) are more suitable and less error-prone
   ways to obtain such information.

   Note that the "instance" URI reference may be relative; this means
   that it must be resolved relative to the document's base URI, as per
   [I-D.ietf-core-coral].

2.1.  Examples

   This section presents a series of examples of the basic vocabulary in
   CoRAL textual format (Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-core-coral]).  The
   examples are fictitious.  No identification with actual products is
   intended or should be inferred.  All examples involve the same CoAP
   problem type with semantics of "unknown key id", defined in the
   fictitious namespace "http://vocabulary.private-api.example".

   Note that CoRAL documents are exchanged in CoRAL binary format
   (Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-core-coral]) in practice.  This includes the
   use of [I-D.ietf-core-href] as an alternative to URIs that is
   optimized for constrained nodes.

   The example in Figure 2 has the most compact representation.  It
   avoids any non-mandatory element.  This is suitable for a constrained
   receiver that happens to have precise knowledge of the semantics
   associated with the "type".

   #using pd = <http://example.org/vocabulary/problem-details#>
   #using ex = <http://vocabulary.private-api.example/#>

   pd:type         ex:unknown-key-id

                            Figure 2: Minimalist

   The example in Figure 3 has all the mandatory as well as the optional
   elements populated.  This format is appropriate for a less
   constrained receiver (for example, an edge gateway forwarding to a
   log server that needs to gather as much contextual information as
   possible, including the problem "headline", details about the error
   condition, and an error-specific instance URL).

   #using pd = <http://example.org/vocabulary/problem-details#>
   #using ex = <http://vocabulary.private-api.example/#>

   pd:type         ex:unknown-key-id
   pd:title        "unknown key id"
   pd:detail       "Key with id 0x01020304 not registered"
   pd:instance     <https://private-api.example/errors/5>

                           Figure 3: Full-Fledged

3.  Additional Problem Details

   Problem type definitions MAY extend the Problem Details document with
   additional elements to convey additional, problem-specific
   information.

   Clients consuming problem details MUST ignore any such elements that
   they do not recognize; this allows problem types to evolve and
   include additional information in the future.

3.1.  Examples

   The example in Figure 4 has all the basic elements as well as an
   additional, type-specific element.

   #using pd = <http://example.org/vocabulary/problem-details#>
   #using ex = <http://vocabulary.private-api.example/#>

   pd:type         ex:unknown-key-id
   pd:title        "unknown key id"
   pd:detail       "Key with id 0x01020304 not registered"
   pd:instance     <https://private-api.example/errors/5>
   ex:key-id       0x01020304

                   Figure 4: Full Payload and Extensions

4.  Security Considerations

   Problem Details for CoAP APIs are serialized in the CoRAL binary
   format.  See Section 11 of [RFC7252] for security considerations
   relating to CoAP.  See Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-core-coral] for
   security considerations relating to CoRAL.

   The security and privacy considerations outlined in Section 5 of
   [RFC7807] apply in full.
