Internet-Draft                 The EPC URN                   August 2007


1.  Introduction

   The EPCglobal Architecture Framework [6] is set of specifications for
   reading, managing and acting on object codes plus other sensor data
   as physical objects pass through a supply chain.  Events and metadata
   about physical objects are exchanged via EPC Information Services
   (EPCIS) that are essentially web services that implement agreed upon
   schema and interfaces.

   Each object that is tracked by the EPCglobal Architecture Framework
   is identified by one or more managed identifiers.  In many cases
   these identification systems existed prior to the Internet becoming
   widely used.  One such namespace is the Global Trade Item Number, or
   GTIN [7].  GTINs are widely used in global commerce and are managed
   by GS1.  In order for the EPCglobal Architecture Framework to
   leverage the Internet to the fullest extent possible, the GTIN
   namespace (and others such as Global Location Numbers (GLNs),
   Serialized Shipping Container Code (SSCC), etc [7]) need to be
   directly compatible with the URI family of identifiers.

   The use of GTINs, GLNs and SSCCs are all managed by GS1.  Their use
   within the EPCglobal Architecture Framework is mnaged by the GS1
   subsidiary known as EPCglobal, Inc. For these, and possibly future
   identification systems, a single Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespace ID (NID) is being requested: 'epc'.  Each of the identifier
   namespaces mentioned will have a separate sub-space beneath the top
   level 'epc' NID.

   In addition to physical object identifiers, the EPCglobal
   Architecture Framework requires new namespaces for naming system
   components.  In many cases an interface within the EPCglobal
   Architecture Framework is XML [11] based and as such will require
   naming schemes for its XML schema [9] and various namespaces [10].
   For these uses, another Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace ID
   (NID) is being requested: 'epcglobal'.  Each specification or system
   component within the EPCglobal Architecture Framework will have a
   separate sub-space beneath the top level 'epcglobal' NID.

   Since the EPCglobal Architecture Framework is engineered for wide
   spread and general use, this namespace specification is a formal one
   and the namespace IDs that are being requested are 'epc' and
   'epcglobal'.  It is important to note that it is the explicit intent
   that various sub-namespaces of the 'epc' NID actually name real,
   physical objects and/or corporeal entities.  In contrast, sub-
   namespaces of the 'epcglobal' NID name logical or software constructs
   such as schema namespaces.

2.  'epc' Registration Template

   Namespace ID:

         "epc" requested.

   Registration Information:

         Registration Version Number: 1
         Registration Date: 2005-02-15

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

         EPCglobal, Inc. is a subsidiary of GS1
         Princeton Pike Corporate Center
         1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 202

         bhogan@epcglobalinc.org
         Tel: +1-609-620-4585

   Declaration of structure:

         The normative specification of the structure of the 'epc'
         namespace is "EPC Tag Data Standards" [5].  The examples given
         below are not normative.

         The 'epc' namespace is a set of sub-namespaces that can be
         extended in the future.  The following ABNF [2] defines how the
         sub-namespaces are identified and any restrictions on their
         syntax (definitions not specified below can be found in RFC
         2141 [1]):

   EPC-URN     = "urn:epc:" sub-ns-name ":" sub-ns
   sub-ns-name = let-num [ 1*let-num-hyp ]
   sub-ns      = 1*URN chars
   let-num     = upper / lower / number
   let-num-hyp = upper / lower / number / "-"
   upper       = %x41-5A ; "A" - "Z"
   lower       = %x61-7A ; "a" - "z"
   number      = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" /
                 "8" / "9"

         For example, the sub-namespace 'sgtin' has the following
         definition (this ABNF is non-normative):

Internet-Draft                 The EPC URN                   August 2007


   SGTIN-URI        = "urn:epc:id:sgtin:" SGTINURIBody
   SGTINURIBody     = 2*(PaddedNumericComponent ".") NumericComponent
   NumericComponent = ZeroComponent / NonZeroComponent
   ZeroComponent    = "0"
   NonZeroComponent = NonZeroDigit *Digit
   PaddedNumericComponent = *Digit
   Digit = "0" / NonZeroDigit
   NonZeroDigit = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"

         This equates to a namespace that has three period separated
         series of digits:

                        urn:epc:id:sgtin:900100.0003456.1234567

         The first series is a company prefix, the 2nd denotes a product
         reference assigned by that company, and the third is a serial
         number for a specific instance of their product.  Note that
         leading zeros are significant.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

         The standards that define the EPCglobal Architecture Framework
         and the processes for creating new sub-namespaces are managed
         by EPCglobal, Inc and can be found on its website.  Several
         sub-namespaces are defined in the "EPC Tag Data Standards" [5].

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

         The namespaces that make up the 'epc' namespace are all managed
         by an organization with almost 50 years of namespace management
         experience.  In all cases (existing or new) the uniqueness of
         each namespace is an inherent part of the EPCglobal
         Architecture Framework.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

         The assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned
         and that the binding between the name and and its resource is
         permanent, regardless of any standards or organizational
         changes.

   Process of identifier assignment:

         Names are assigned by the EPCglobal standards publication
         process and by any entities that are sub-delegated by
         EPCglobal.  It is important to note that in many cases the
         names assigned will explicitly denote physical objects and not
         an electronic representation of that object.

Internet-Draft                 The EPC URN                   August 2007


   Process of identifier resolution:

         Certain sub-namespaces are resolved via the Object Naming
         Service which is defined in "Object Naming Service (ONS)
         Version 1.0" [4] which is a valid implementation of the Dynamic
         Delegation Discovery System that is defined in RFC 3401 [3].

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

         The entire URN is case-sensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

         There are no additional characters reserved except as noted in
         the ABNF above.

   Validation mechanism:

         In the case of each sub-namespace there will be namespace
         specific rules for determining validity.  In each case the
         reader is referred to the appropriate EPCglobal-maintained
         documentation.

   Scope:

         Global



3.  'epcglobal' Registration Template

   Namespace ID:

         "epcglobal" requested.

   Registration Information:

         Registration Version Number: 1
         Registration Date: 2007-03-06

   Declaration of structure:

         The normative specification of the structure of the 'epcglobal'
         namespace are various standards available at EPCglobal's public
         web site.  The examples given below are not normative.

         The 'epcglobal' namespace is a set of sub-namespaces that can
         be extended in the future.  The following ABNF defines how the
         sub-namespaces are identified and any restrictions on their
         syntax (definitions not specified below can be found in RFC
         2141 [1]):

   EPCGLOBAL-URN = "urn:epcglobal:" subnsname ":" subns
   subnsname     = let-num [ 1*let-num-hyp ]
   subns         = 1*URN chars
   let-num       = upper / lower / number
   let-num-hyp   = upper / lower / number / "-"
   upper         = %x41-5A ; "A" - "Z"
   lower         = %x61-7A ; "a" - "z"
   number        = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" /
                   "8" / "9"

         For example, the identifier "urn:epcglobal:ale:xsd:1" is
         defined in the "Application Level Events 1.0 Specficiation" [8]
         for use as an XML namespace identifier for XML documents
         conforming to that specification.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

         The standards that define the EPCglobal Architecture Framework
         and the processes for creating new sub-namespaces are managed
         by EPCglobal, Inc and can be found on its website.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

         The namespaces that make up the 'epcglobal' namespace are all
         managed by an organization with almost 50 years of namespace
         management experience.  In all cases the uniqueness of each
         namespace is an inherent part of the EPCglobal Architecture
         Framework.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes two URN Namespace registrations that are to be
   entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.


5.  Namespace Considerations

   Due to EPCglobal Inc being a subsidiary of an internationally
   recognized authority for the identifiers embedded within the 'epc'



Mealling                Expires February 6, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 The EPC URN                   August 2007


   namespace, as well as being the internationally recognized standards
   body for the standards that define identifiers in the 'epcglobal'
   namespace, these namespaces represent the best approach to naming
   products and entities within the world of supply chain management and
   ecommerce in general.  There are no other alternative namespaces that
   have the level of authority and industry acceptance that the EPC
   does.


6.  Community Considerations

   The EPCglobal Architecture Framework is intended to bring the
   Internet to the world of supply chain management and beyond.  It can
   be used to tie physical objects to their virtual descriptions and as
   such has many wide ranging applications for the average Internet use.
   Thus it is very much the intent that this namespace and the entire
   EPCglobal Architecture Framework considers the entire Internet as the
   scope of its community.


7.  Security Considerations

   The EPCglobal Architecture Framework is based almost exclusively on
   Internet and Web standards.  Thus the security impacts of each of its
   underlying technologies should be examined for weaknesses and
   threats.  The primary threats will come from the fact that these
   names will identify physical things that can be of high value, thus
   the temptation to spoof metadata about that identifier (its cost,
   size, etc) will be much greater.  Therefore the role of digital
   signatures, secure resolution mechanisms and trust relationships is
   very fundamental to the system.
