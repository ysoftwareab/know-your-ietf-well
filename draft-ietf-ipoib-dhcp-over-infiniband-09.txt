Abstract

    An InfiniBand network uses a link-layer addressing scheme that is
    20-octets long. This is larger than the 16-octets reserved for the
    hardware address in DHCP/BOOTP message. The above inequality imposes
    restrictions on the use of the DHCP message fields when used over an
    IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB) network.  This document describes the use
    of DHCP message fields when implementing DHCP over IPoIB.

1. Introduction

    The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework

INTERNET-DRAFT            DHCP over InfiniBand             February 2005


    for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network
    [RFC2131]. DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [RFC951]
    adding the capability of automatic allocation of reusable network
    addresses and additional configuration options [RFC2131,RFC2132].

    The DHCP server receives a broadcast request from the DHCP client.
    The DHCP server uses the client interface's hardware-address to
    unicast a reply back when the client doesn't yet have an IP address
    assigned to it. The "chaddr" field in the DHCP message carries the
    client's hardware address.

    The "chaddr" field is 16-octets in length. The IPoIB link-layer
    address is 20-octets in length. Therefore the IPoIB link-layer
    address will not fit in the "chaddr" field making it impossible for
    the DHCP server to unicast a reply back to the client.

    To ensure interoperability the usage of the fields and the method
    for DHCP interaction must be clarified. This document describes the
    IPoIB specific usage of some fields of DHCP. See [RFC2131] for the
    mechanism of DHCP and the explanations of each field.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. The DHCP over IPoIB mechanism

    As described above, the link-layer address is unavailable to the
    DHCP server because the link-layer address is larger than the
    "chaddr" field length. As a result the server cannot unicast its
    reply back to the client.  Therefore, a DHCP client MUST request
    that the server sends a broadcast reply by setting the BROADCAST
    flag when IPoIB ARP is not possible, i.e. in situations where the
    client does not know its IP address.

    [RFC1542] notes that the use of a broadcast reply is discouraged.
    But in the case of IPoIB this is a necessity because the server does
    not receive the link-layer address. To desynchronise broadcasts at
    subnet startup, [RFC2131] suggests that a client wait a random time
    (1 to 10 seconds) before initiating server discovery. The same
    timeout will equally spread out the DHCP server broadcast responses
    generated due to the use of the use of the BROADCAST bit.

    The client hardware address, "chaddr", is unique in the subnet and
    hence can be used to identify the client interface. But in the
    absence of a unique "chaddr", another unique client identifier must
    be used.

INTERNET-DRAFT            DHCP over InfiniBand             February 2005


    The DHCP protocol states that the "client-identifier" option may be
    used as the unique identifying value for the client [RFC2132].  This
    value must be unique within the subnet the client is a member of.

    The "client-identifier" option includes a type and identifier pair.
    The identifier included in the "client-identifier" option may
    consist of a hardware address or any other unique value such as the
    DNS name of the client. When a hardware address is used, the type
    field should be one of the ARP hardware types listed in [ARPPARAM].

2.1 IPoIB specific usage of DHCP message fields

    A DHCP client, when working over an IPoIB interface, MUST follow the
    following rules:

        "htype" (hardware address type) MUST be 32 [ARPPARAM]

        "hlen" (hardware address length) MUST be 0.

        "chaddr" (client hardware address) field MUST be zeroed.

        "client-identifier" option MUST be used in DHCP messages.

    According to [RFC2132] the "client-identifier" option may consist of
    any data that uniquely identifies the interface. Examples of
    suitable "client-identifier" values are the link-layer address,
    fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or, an EUI-64 value associated
    with the interface.

2.1 Use of the BROADCAST flag

    A DHCP client on IPoIB MUST set the BROADCAST flag in DHCPDISCOVER
    and DHCPREQUEST messages (and set "ciaddr" to zero) to ensure that
    the server (or the relay agent) broadcasts its reply to the client.

    Note: As described in [RFC2131], "ciaddr" MUST be filled in
          with client's IP address during BOUND, RENEWING or
          REBINDING state, therefore, the BROADCAST flag MUST NOT
          be set. In these cases, the DHCP server unicasts DHCPACK
          message to the address in "ciaddr". The link address
          will be resolved by ARP.

3. Security Considerations

    [RFC2131] describes the security considerations relevant to DHCP.
    This document does not introduce any new issues.

    This document borrows extensively from [RFC2855]. Roy Larsen pointed
    out the length discrepancy between the IPoIB link address and DHCP's
    "chaddr" field.
