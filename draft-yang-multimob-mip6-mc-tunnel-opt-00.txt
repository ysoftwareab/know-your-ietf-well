Internet-Draft           Multicast Opt for MIPv6           November 2007


Abstract

   This document provides the solution to optimize the multicast
   tunneling in mobile IPv6.  This solution will not break the basic bi-
   directional tunneling multicast solution of MIPv6.  A new Mobile
   Multicast Agent works as a proxy node for multiple mobile nodes
   within one limit scope.  Single tunnel is set up between one Home
   Agent and one Mobile Multicast Agent for single multicast stream.  A
   new notification message is created for the communication between
   home agent and mobile multicast agent.  There is no modification on
   mobile nodes.

Internet-Draft           Multicast Opt for MIPv6           November 2007


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)[RFC3775] allows the mobile nodes(MN) to maintain
   the reachability while moving in the IPv6 network.  After
   registration to home agent(HA), the packets destined to MN could be
   routed correctly by using the end-to-end tunnel, while MN is away
   from the home network.  MIPv6 has some other extensions (HMIP6
   [RFC4140] and FMIP6 [RFC4068] for different application schemes.

   Multicast is an optimal way for mass multimedia delivery of gourp
   communication in mobile network.  Mobile IPTV is one of such group
   communication cases, where multicast is suitable.  [Yang07].  MIPv6
   has two methods for multicast.  [Schmidt07] has analysis on these two
   ways:

   - Remote multicast subsciption: this solution rely on multicast
   router, which is seldom available in the mobile network.  It also
   suffers from the slow handover.

   - Bi-directional tunneling: The advantage of the bi-directional
   tunneling solution is its simplicity and the transparency of handover
   to the multicast operation.  But multiple tunnels are set up between
   MNs and HA even for one single multicast stream.  This tunnel
   overhead weakens the benefit of using multicast greatly.  So, this
   document proposes the solution to optimize the bi-direction tunneling
   multicast solution of MIPv6.  With simple extension, this solution
   could also be applied to other extended MIPv6 solution as well.

   When MN is in the foreign network, the packet routing between HA and
   MN is at least via an access router(AR).  AR is the first hop for MN
   to get access to internet.  The characteristics of the link between
   MN and AR are different depending on the types of access network and
   radio links.  So, the multicast optimization between MN and AR should
   be specific for access network.  In this document, the solution is
   only focused on the multicast tunnels between AR and HA.

2.  Solution for MIPv6 multicast tunneling optimization

   Currently bi-directional tunneling multicast routing in foreign
   network is depicted in the picture below:

             Access network
          (Wired or Wireless)                     IP multicast
                  |                                  packets
                  |                                      |
   +------+       V       +------+             +------+  |
   |      |===============|======|=============|      |  |
   |  MN  |               |  AR  |             |  HA  |  V
   |      |               |======|=============|      |-----
   +------+             //+------+             +------+
                      //
          +------+  //< -------bi-dictional
          |      |//           tunnel.
          |  MN  |
          |      |
          +------+


   In this document, a new mobile multicast agent(MMA) is proposed to
   optimize the multicast tunneling solution of MIPv6.  In the real
   deployment, MMA and AR could be collocated together.  The new
   solution of bi-directional tunneling multicast routing in foreign
   network is depicted in the picture below:

             Access network
          (Wired or Wireless)                       IP multicast
                  |  +......................+          packets
                  |  : may be collocated    :                |
   +------+       V  : +------+    +------+ :      +------+  |
   |      |============|======|====|      | :      |      |  |
   |  MN  |          : |  AR  |    | MMA  |========|  HA  |  V
   |      |          : |======|====|      | :      |      |-----
   +------+          //+------+    +------+ :      +------+
                    //......................+
          +------+ //
          |      |// < -------bi-dictional
          |  MN  |            tunnel.
          |      |
          +------+


   MMA is the termination point of the tunnel from HA.  MMAs should be
   very close to ARs or even collocated with ARs.  Compared with the
   current multicast solution of MIPv6, the number of unicasting tunnels

   for one streams multicast between one pair of AR/MMA and HA will
   decreased to only one.  This is especially meaningful when one HA
   serves many MNs with multicast services.

   The call flow of the optimized MIPv6 multicast is shown below (AR and
   MMA are collocated together):

   (0) HA forwards the MLD membership query message down to MNs via the
   bi-directional tunnels periodically.

   (1) MNs should report their multicast group membership by the MLD
   membership report message.  This message should be tunneled to HA
   firstly and forwarded to the other multicast routers afterwards.

   (2) When HA finds that MN(s) want to have join the new multicast
   groups, it will notify AR/MMA with the information of related MN
   addresses and multicast addresses.  It may also put some other

   streams related messages inside the notification message.  AR/MMA
   will store this information inside the Multicast Serving Table (MST).
   HA will also store the triple-units of (MN, AR/MMA, Multicast
   Address) in the local cache.

   (3) HA receives one multicast stream from the multicast router.  HA
   will check the cached (MN, AR/MMA, multicast address) based on the
   multicast address of incoming multicast stream.

   (4) HA will tunnel the stream to the related AR/MMA with single
   tunnel.  The Outer IP header is from HA to AR/MMA.  The inner IP
   packet is the original multicast packet.

   (5) At AR/MMA, it will check the MST and get the addresses of MNs who
   have subsribes this multicast stream.  AR/MMA will make duplication
   of the received tunnel packet based on the number of related MNs.
   then, it will replace the dstination addresses of the outer tunnel
   headers with the Care of Addresses(CoAs) of related MNs repectively.
   Lastly, it will send all these tunnel packets to the MNs.  MNs do not
   need modification to receive these packets.

   (6,7) When MN handover to the subnet of new AR/MMA, it will finish
   BU/BA procedure firstly with HA.

   (8) On parallel, HA sends notification to the new AR/MMA with the
   information of multicast addresses =and MN addresses.  The new AR/MMA
   stores this information inside the (MST) of it's own.

   (9) HA notifies the old AR/MMA to remove the MST entries related to
   the MN addresses.

   (10) HA receives one multicast stream from the multicast router.  HA
   will check the cached (MN, AR/MMA, multicast address) based on the
   multicast address of incoming multicast stream.

   (11) The multicast packet will be tunneled to the new AR/MMA
   accordingly.  The Outer IP header is from HA to new AR/MMA.  The
   inner IP packet is the original multicast packet.

   (12) The new AR/MMA will do the same tunnel duplication and address
   replacement as step (5)

   MMA may be a seperated device from AR.  The tunnel optimization
   solution is almost the same as the combined one.  But it may be
   necessary for HA to discover the new MMA.  How to choose the new MMA
   is out of scope of this document.  And, if MMA does not change while
   MN does handover to new AR, HA does not need to do the step (9) in
   the picture above.

3.  Operation of Mobile Multicast Agent (MMA)

   The main function of MMA is to convert the single multicast tunnel
   from HA to multile tunnels for related MNs respectively.  This
   operation should be done based on the information of MST.  It is
   recommended to put MMA and AR together.

3.1.  Tunnel manipulation

   The logical packet of the tunnel from HA is showed below:

      +----------+------------+---------+--------------+---------+
      | HA's Addr| MMA's Addr |CN's Addr|Multicast Addr| Payload |
      +----------+------------+---------+--------------+---------+
      |< ----  Outer IP ---- >|< ----  Inner IP  ---- >|
      |     tunnel header     |      tunnel header     |


   In the tunneled packet from HA, the destination and original address
   of the outer IP tunnel header is MMA's address and HA's address
   respectively.  The inner IP packet is the original IP multicast
   packet from the corresponding node(CN).

   In MMA, it will check the MST and get the addresses of MNs who have
   subsribes this multicast stream.  Duplication of the received tunnel
   packet will be made based on the number of related MNs.  The
   dstination addresses of the outer tunnel headers will be replaced by
   the Care of Addresses(CoAs) of related MNs repectively.  Lastly, it
   will send all these tunnel packets to the MNs.  The generated tunnel
   packet is depicted in the picture below:

      +----------+------------+---------+--------------+---------+
      | HA's Addr| MN's  CoA  |CN's Addr|Multicast Addr| Payload |
      +----------+------------+---------+--------------+---------+
      |< ----  Outer IP ---- >|< ----  Inner IP  ---- >|
      |     tunnel header     |      tunnel header     |


   The structure of this tunnel packet is the same as the one of the
   tunneled multicast packets between HA and MN in [RFC3775].  So, the
   MN do not need to be modified in this solution.

3.2.  operation of Multicast Serving Table

   MST should at least contains the information of HA address, MNs'
   addresses and related multicast address.  It may have some other
   information, such as the characterastics of streams, timing
   information and mobile TV channel information.  These supplementary

Internet-Draft           Multicast Opt for MIPv6           November 2007


   information is sometimes useful for the stream manipulation.

   The initiation, update and termination of MST entries should only be
   done based on the notification messages from HA.

3.3.  operation of Multicast notification message

   The definition of multicast notification message is out of scope of
   this document.  It could be a specific message or extension to a
   generic message.  This part should be defined by seperated documents.

Internet-Draft           Multicast Opt for MIPv6           November 2007


4.  Security Considerations

   This solution basically does not break the security framework of
   MIPv6.

   Because MLD membership messages should be tunneled, the data traffic
   between HA and MN should be protected by tunnel ESP.  It is
   recommended to set up the security associations (SAs) between HA and
   MMAs.  Notification messages could be protected by transport ESP.

5.  Conclusion

   A new multicast delivery solution in MIPv6 is proposed in this
   solution.  It does not break the basic routing and security framework
   of the original MIPv6 solution.  The multiple unicasting multicast
   tunnels could be avoided between HA and AR.
