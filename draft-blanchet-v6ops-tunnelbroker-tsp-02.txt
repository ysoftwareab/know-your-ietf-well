Abstract

   A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the
   establishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or
   IPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6 or
   UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The control protocol (TSP) is
   used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A
   mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6
   networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT or on IPv6
   only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)              May 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document first describes the TSP framework, the protocol
   details, and the different profiles used.  It then describes the
   applicability of TSP in different environments, some of which were
   described in the v6ops scenario documents.

2.  Description of the TSP framework

   Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) is a signaling protocol to setup tunnel
   parameters between two tunnel end-points.  TSP is implemented as a
   tiny client code in the requesting tunnel end-point.  The other end-
   point is the server that will setup the tunnel service.  TSP uses XML
   basic messaging over TCP or UDP.  The use of XML gives extensibility
   and easy option processing.

   TSP negotiates tunnel parameters between the two tunnel end-points.
   Parameters that are always negociated are:

   o  authentication of the users, using any kind of authentication
      mechanism (through SASL [RFC2222]) including anonymous

   o  Tunnel encapsulation

      *  IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels [RFC2893]

      *  IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels

      *  IPv6 over UDP-IPv4 tunnels

   o  IP address assignment for the tunnel endpoints

   Other tunnel parameters that may be negotiated are:

   o  Tunnel keep-alive

   o  IPv6 prefix assignment when the client is a router

   o  DNS delegation of the inverse tree, based on the IPv6 prefix
      assigned

   o  Routing protocols

   The tunnel encapsulation can be explicitly specified by the client,
   or can be determined during the TSP exchange.  The latter is used to
   detect the presence of NAT in the path and select IPv6 over UDP
   encapsulation.

   The TSP connection can be established between two nodes, where each
   node can control a tunnel end-point.

   The nodes involved in the framework are:

   1.  the TSP client

   2.  client tunnel end-point

   3.  the TSP server

   4.  server tunnel end-point

   1,3 and 4 form the tunnel broker model [RFC3053], where 3 is the
   tunnel broker and 4 is the tunnel server (Figure 1).  The tunnel
   broker may control one or many tunnel servers.

   In its simplest model, one node is the client configured as a tunnel
   end-point (1 and 2 on same node), and the second node is the server
   configured as the other tunnel end-point (3 and 4 on same node).
   This model is shown in Figure 2

        Figure 2: Tunnel Setup Protocol used on Tunnel Server model

   From the point of view of an operating system, TSP is implemented as
   a client application which is able to configure network parameters of
   the operating system.

2.1  NAT Discovery

   TSP is also used to discover if a NAT is in the path.  In this
   discovery mode, the client sends a TSP message over UDP, containing
   its tunnel request information (such as its source IPv4 address) to
   the TSP server.  The TSP server compares the IPv4 source address of
   the packet with the address in the TSP message.  If they differ, an
   IPv4 NAT is in the path.

   If an IPv4 NAT is discovered, then IPv6 over UDP-IPv4 tunnel
   encapsulation is selected.  Once the TSP signaling is done, the
   tunnel is established over the same UDP channel used for TSP, so the
   same NAT address-port mapping is used for both the TSP session and
   the IPv6 traffic.  If no IPv4 NAT is detected in the path by the TSP
   server, then IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation is used.

   A keep-alive mechanism is also included to keep the NAT mapping
   active.

   The IPv4 NAT discovery builds the most effective tunnel for all
   cases, including in a dynamic situation where the client moves.  On
   the IPv6 layer, if the client uses user authentication, the same IPv6
   address and prefix are kept and re-established.

2.2  Any encapsulation

   TSP is used to negotiate IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels, IPv6 over UDP-IPv4
   tunnels and IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels.  IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels are used
   in the Dual Stack Transition Mechanism (DSTM) together with TSP
   [I-D.ietf-ngtrans-dstm].

2.3  Mobility

   When a node moves to a different IP network (i.e. change of its IPv4
   address when doing IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation), the TSP client
   reconnects automatically to the broker to re-establish the tunnel
   (keep-alive mechanism).  The IPv6 address does not change.

3.  Advantages of TSP

   o  Tunnels established by TSP are static tunnels, which are more
      secure than automated tunnels.  No 3rd party relay required.

   o  Stability of the IP address and prefix, enabling applications
      needing stable address to be deployed and used.  For example, when
      tunneling IPv6, there is no dependency on the underlying IPv4
      address.

   o  Prefix assignment supported.  Can use provider address space.

   o  Signaling protocol flexible and extensible (XML, SASL)

   o  One solution to many encapsulation techniques: v6 in v4, v4 in v6,
      v6 over UDP over v4, ...

   o  Discovery of IPv4 NAT in the path, establishing the most optimized
      tunnelling technique depending on the discovery.


4.  Protocol Description

4.1  Terminology

   Tunnel Broker (TB): In a tunnel broker model, the broker is taking
      charge of all communication between tunnel servers (TS) and tunnel
      clients (TC).  Tunnel clients query brokers for a tunnel and the
      broker finds a suitable tunnel server, asks the Tunnel server to
      setup the tunnel and sends the tunnel information to the Tunnel
      Client.

   Tunnel Server (TS): Tunnel Servers are providing the specific tunnel
      service to a Tunnel Client.  It can receive the tunnel request
      from a Tunnel Broker (as in the Tunnel Broker model) or directly
      from the Tunnel Client.  The Tunnel Server is the tunnel end-
      point.

   Tunnel Client (TC): The tunnel client is the entity that needs a
      tunnel for a particular service or connectivity.  A tunnel client
      can be either a host or a router.  The tunnel client is the other
      tunnel end-point.

4.2  Topology

   The following diagrams describe typical TSP scenarios.  The goal is
   to establish a tunnel between Tunnel client and Tunnel server.

4.3  Overview

   The Tunnel Setup Protocol is initiated from a client node to a tunnel
   broker.  The Tunnel Setup Protocol has three phases:

   Authentication phase: The Authentication phase is when the tunnel
      broker/server advertises its capability to a tunnel client and
      when a tunnel client authenticate to the broker/server.

   Command phase: The command phase is where the client requests or
      updates a tunnel.

   Response phase: The response phase is where the tunnel client
      receives the request response from the tunnel broker/server, and
      the client accepts or rejects the tunnel offered.

   For each command sent by a Tunnel Client there is an expected
   response by the server.

   After the response phase is completed, a tunnel is established as
   requested by the client.  If requested, periodic keep-alive packets
   can be sent from the client to the server.

4.4  TSP signaling

   The following sections describes in detail the TSP protocol and the
   different phases in the TSP signaling.

4.4.1  Signaling transport

   TSP signaling can be transported over TCP or UDP, and over IPv4 or
   IPv6.  The tunnel client selects the transport according to the
   tunnel encapsulation to be requested.  Figure 4 shows the transport
   used for TSP signaling with possible tunnel encapsulation requested.

   TSP signaling over UDP/v4 MUST be used if a v6 over UDP over IPv4
   (v6udpv4) tunnel is to be requested (e.g., for NAT traversal).

   Note that the TSP framework allows for other type of encapsulation to
   be defined, such as IPv6 over GRE.

4.4.1.1  TSP signaling over TCP

   TSP over TCP is sent over port number 3653 (IANA assigned).  TSP data
   used during signaling is detailed in the next sections.

4.4.1.2  TSP signaling over UDP/v4

   While TCP provides the connection-oriented and reliable data delivery
   features required during the TSP signaling session, UDP does not
   offer any reliability.  This reliability is added inside the TSP
   session as an extra header at the beginning of the UDP payload.

                   +------+-----------+------------+----------+
                   | IPv4 | UDP       | TSP header | TSP data |
                   |      | port 3653 |            |          |
                   +------+-----------+------------+----------+

            Figure 6: Tunnel Setup Protocol packet format (UDP)

   The algorithm used to add reliability to TSP packets sent over UDP is
   described in section 22.5 in [UNP].

      The four bit field (0-3) is set to 0xF.  This marker is used by
      the tunnel broker to identify a TSP signaling packets that is sent
      after an IPv6 over UDP is established.  This is explained in
      section Section 4.5.2

   Sequence Number: 28 bit field.  Set by the tunnel client.  Value is
      increased by one for every new packet sent to the tunnel broker.
      The return packet from the broker contains the unaltered sequence
      number.

   Timestamp: 32 bit field.  Set by the tunnel client.  Generated from
      the client local time value.  The return packet from the broker
      contains the unaltered timestamp.

   TSP data: Same as in the TCP/v4 case.  Content described in latter
      sections.

   The TSP client builds its UDP packet as described above and sends it
   to the tunnel broker.  When the tunnel broker responds, the same
   values for the sequence number and timestamp MUST be sent back to the
   client.  The TSP client can use the timestamp to determine the
   retransmission timeout (current time minus the packet timestamp).
   The client SHOULD retransmit the packet when the retransmission
   timeout is reached.  The retransmitted packet MUST use the same
   sequence number as the original packet so that the server can detect
   duplicate packets.  The client SHOULD use exponential backoff when
   retranmitting packets to avoid network congestion.

4.4.2  Authentication phase

   The authentication phase has 3 steps :

   o  Client's protocol version identification

   o  Server's capability advertisement

   o  Client authentication

   When a TCP or UDP session is established to a tunnel broker, the
   tunnel client sends the current protocol version it is supporting.
   The version number syntax is:

      VERSION=2.0.0 CR LF

   Version 2.0.0 is the version number of this specification.  Version
   1.0.0 was defined in earlier drafts.

   If the server doesn't support the protocol version it sends an error
   message and closes the session.  The server can optionally send a
   server list that may support the protocol version of the client.

   Example of a Version not supported (without a server list)

         -- Successful TCP Connection --
         C:VERSION=0.1 CR LF
         S:302 Unsupported client version CR LF
         -- Connection closed --

         -- Connection closed --

                                 Figure 9

   If the server supports the version sent by the client, then the
   server sends a list of the capabilities supported for authentication
   and tunnels.

      CAPABILITY TUNNEL=V6V4 TUNNEL=V6UDPV4 AUTH=ANONYMOUS AUTH=PLAIN
      AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 CR LF

   Tunnel types must be registered with IANA and their profiles are
   defined in Section 7.  Authentication is done using SASL [RFC2222].
   Each authentication mechanism must be a registered SASL mechanism.
   Description of such mechanism is not in the scope of this document.

   The tunnel client can then choose to close the session if none of the
   capabilities fits its needs.  If the tunnel client chooses to
   continue, it authenticates to the server using one of the advertised
   mechanism.  If the authentication fails the server sends an error
   message and closes the session.

   The example in Figure 10 shows a failed authentication where the
   tunnel client requests an anonymous authentication which is not
   supported by the server.  The following example in Figure 11 shows a
   successful anonymous authentication.

   Once the authentication succeeds, the server sends a success return
   code and the protocol enters the Command phase.

4.4.3  Command and response phase

   The Command phase is where the tunnel client send a tunnel request or
   a tunnel update to the server.  In this phase, commands are sent as
   XML messages.  The first line is a "Content-length" directive that
   indicates the size of the following XML message.  When the server
   sends a response, the first line is the "Content-length" directive,
   the second is the return code and third one is the XML message if
   any.  The "Content-length" is calculated from the first character of
   the return code line to the last character of the XML message,
   inclusively.

   Spaces can be inserted freely.

   The example in Figure 14 shows a client requesting an anonymous

   every 30 seconds.  The tunnel broker responds with the tunnel
   parameters and indicates its acceptance of the keepalive period
   (Section 4.6).  Finally, the client sends an accept message to the
   server.

   Once the accept message has been sent, the server and client
   configure their tunnel endpoint based on the negotiated tunnel
   parameters.

4.5  Tunnel establishment

4.5.1  IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels

   Once the TSP signaling is completed, a tunnel can be established on
   the tunnel server and client node.  If a v6v4 tunnel has been
   negotiated, then an IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel [RFC2893] is established
   using the operating system tunneling interface.  On the client node,
   this is accomplished by the TSP client calling the appropriate OS
   commands or system calls.

4.5.2  IPv6-over-UDP tunnels

   If a v6udpv4 tunnel is configured, the same source/destination
   address and port used during the TSP signaling are used to configure
   the v6udpv4 tunnel.  If a NAT is in the path between the TSP client
   and tunnel broker, the TSP signaling session will have created a UDP
   state in the NAT.  By reusing the same UDP socket parameters to
   transport IPv6, the traffic will flow across the NAT using the same
   state.

                   +------+-----------+--------+
                   | IPv4 | UDP       |  IPv6  |
                   |      | port 3653 |        |
                   +------+-----------+--------+

                    Figure 15: IPv6 transport over UDP

   At any time, a client may re-establish a TSP signaling session.  The
   client disconnects the current tunnel and starts a new TSP signaling
   session as described in Section 4.4.1.2.  If a NAT is present and the
   new TSP session uses the same UDP mapping in the NAT as for the
   tunnel, the tunnel broker will need to disconnect the client tunnel
   before the client can establish a new TSP session.

4.6  Tunnel Keep-alive

   A TSP client may select to send periodic keep-alive messages to the
   server in order to maintain its tunnel connectivity.  This allows the
   client to detect network changes and enable automatic tunnel re-
   establishment.  In the case of IPv6-over-UDP tunnels, periodic keep-
   alive can help refresh the connection state in a NAT if such device
   is in the tunnel path.

   For IPv6-over-IPv4 and IPv6-over-UDP tunnels, the keep-alive message
   is an ICMPv6 echo request [RFC2463] sent from the client to the
   tunnel server.  The IPv6 destination address of the echo message MUST
   be the address from the 'keepalive' element sent in the tunnel



Blanchet & Parent       Expires November 13, 2005              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)              May 2005


   response during the TSP signaling (Section 4.4.3).  The echo message
   is sent over the configured tunnel.

   The tunnel server responds to the ICMPv6 echo requests and can keep
   track of which tunnel is active.  Any client traffic can also be used
   to verify if the tunnel is active.  This can be used to disconnect
   tunnels that are no longer in use.

   The server can send a different keep-alive interval from the value
   specified in the client request.  The client MUST conform to the
   server specified keep-alive interval.  The client SHOULD apply a
   random "jitter" value to avoid synchronization of keep-alive messages
   from many clients to the server [FJ93].  This can be achieved by
   using an interval value in the range of [0.75T - T], where T is the
   keep-alive interval specified by the server.

4.7  XML Messaging

   This section describes the XML messaging used in the TSP signaling
   during the command and response phase.  The XML elements and
   attributes are listed in the DTD (Appendix A

4.7.1  Tunnel

   The client and server use the tunnel token with an action attribute.
   Valid actions for this profile are : 'create', 'delete', 'info',
   'accept' and 'reject'.

   create: action used to request a new tunnel or update an existing
      tunnel.  Sent from the tunnel client.

   delete: action used to remove an existing tunnel from the server.
      Sent from the tunnel client.

   info: action used to request current properties of an existing
      tunnel.  This action is also used by the tunnel broker to send
      tunnel parameters following a client 'create' action.

   accept: action used by the client to acknowledge the server that the
      tunnel parameters are accepted.  The client will establish a
      tunnel.

   reject: action used by the client to signal the server that the
      tunnel parameters offered are rejected and no tunnel will be
      established.

   The tunnel 'lifetime' attribute is set by the tunnel broker and
   specifies the lifetime of the tunnel in minutes.The lifetime is an

   administratively set value.  When a tunnel lifetime is expired, it is
   disconnected on the tunnel server.

   The 'tunnel' message contains three elements:

   client Client's information

   server Server's information

   broker List of other server's


4.7.2  Client Element

   The client element contains 2 elements: 'address' and 'router'.
   These elements are used to describe the client request and will be
   used by the server to create the appropriate tunnel.  This is the
   only element sent by a client.

   The 'address' element is used to identify the client IP endpoint of
   the tunnel.  When tunneling over IPv4, the client MUST send only an
   IPv4 address to the server.  When tunneling over IPv6, the client
   MUST only send an IPv6 address to the server.

   The server then returns the assigned IPv6 or IPv4 address endpoint
   and domain name inside the 'client' element when the tunnel is
   created or updated.  If supported by the server, the 'client' element
   may contain the registered DNS name for the address endpoint assigned
   to the client.

   Optionally a client can send a 'router' element to ask for a prefix
   delegation.

4.7.3  Server Element

   The 'server' element contains 2 elements: 'address' and 'router'.
   These elements are used to describe the server's tunnel endpoint.
   The 'address' element is used to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   of the server's tunnel endpoint, while the 'router' element provides
   information for the routing method chosen by the client.

4.7.4  Broker Element

   The 'broker' element is used by a tunnel broker to provide a
   alternate list of brokers to a client in the case where the server is
   not able to provide the requested tunnel.

   The 'broker' element contains a series of 'address' element(s).

   A simple tunnel request consist of a 'tunnel' element which contains
   only an 'address' element.  The tunnel action is 'create', specifying
   a 'v6v4' tunnel encapsulation type.  The response sent by the tunnel
   broker is an 'info' action.  Note that the registered FQDN of the
   assigned client IPv6 address is also returned to the tunnel client.

5.4  NAT Traversal tunnel request

   When a client is capable of both IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv6 over UDP
   over IPv4 encapsulation, it can request the broker, by using the

   "v6anyv4" tunnel mode, to determine if it is behind a NAT and to send
   the appropriate tunnel encapsulation mode as part of the response.
   The client can also explicitly request an IPv6 over UDP over IPv4
   tunnel by specifying "v6udpv4" in its request.

   In the following example, the client informs the server that it
   requests to send keep-alives every 30 seconds.  Its its response, the
   server accepted the client suggested keep-alive interval, and the
   IPv6 destination address for the keep-alive packets is specified.

6.  Applicability of TSP in Different Environments

   This section describes the applicability of TSP in different
   environments.

6.1  Applicability of TSP in Provider Networks with Enterprise Customers

   In a provider network where IPv4 is dominant, a tunnelled



Blanchet & Parent       Expires November 13, 2005              [Page 22]

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)              May 2005


   infrastructure can be used to provide IPv6 services to the enterprise
   customers, before a full IPv6 native infrastructure is built.  In
   order to start deploying in a controlled manner and to give
   enterprise customers a prefix, the TSP framework is used.  The TSP
   server can be in the core, in the aggregation points or in the PoPs
   to offer the service to the customers.  IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation
   can be used.  If the customers are behind an IPv4 NAT, then IPv6 over
   UDP-IPv4 encapsulation can be used.  TSP can be used in combination
   of other techniques.

6.2  Applicability of TSP in Provider Networks with Home/Small Office
     Customers

   In a provider network where IPv4 is dominant, a tunnelled
   infrastructure can be used to provider IPv6 services to the home/
   small office customers, before a full IPv6 native infrastructure is
   built.  The small networks such as Home/Small offices have a non-
   upgradable gateway with NAT.  TSP with NAT traversal is used to offer
   IPv6 connectivity and a prefix to the internal network.

   Automation of the prefix assignment and DNS delegation, done by TSP,
   is a very important feature for a provider in order to substantially
   decrease support costs.  The provider can use the same AAA database
   that is used to authenticate the dial in or IPv4 users.  Customers
   can deploy home IPv6 networks without any intervention of the
   provider support people.

   With the NAT discovery function of TSP, providers can use the same
   TSP infrastructure for both NAT and non-NAT parts of the network.

6.3  Applicability of TSP in Enterprise Networks

   In an enterprise network where IPv4 is dominant, a tunnelled
   infrastructure can be used to provider IPv6 services to the IPv6
   islands (hosts or networks) inside the enterprise, before a full IPv6
   native infrastructure is built.  TSP can be used to give IPv6
   connectivity, prefix and routing for the islands.  This gives to the
   enterprise a full control deployment of IPv6 while maintaining
   automation and permanence of the IPv6 assignments to the islands.

6.4  Applicability of TSP in Wireless Networks

   In a wireless network where IPv4 is dominant, hosts and networks move
   and change IPv4 address.  TSP enables the automatic re-establishment
   of the tunnel when the IPv4 address change.

   In a wireless network where IPv6 is dominant, hosts and networks
   move.  TSP enables the automatic re-establishment of the tunnel



Blanchet & Parent       Expires November 13, 2005              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)              May 2005


   together with the DSTM mechanism.

6.5  Applicability of TSP in Unmanaged networks

   An unmanaged network is where no network manager or staff is
   available to configure network devices.  TSP is particularly powerful
   in this context where automation of all necessary information for the
   IPv6 connectivity is handled by TSP: tunnel end-points parameters,
   prefix assignment, dns delegation, routing.

   An unmanaged network may be behind a NAT, maybe not.  With the NAT
   discovery function, TSP works automatically in both cases.

6.6  Applicability of TSP for Mobile Hosts and Mobile Networks

   Mobile hosts are common and used.  Laptops moving from wireless,
   wired in office, home, ... are examples.  They often have IPv4
   connectivity, but not necessarily IPv6.  TSP framework enables the
   mobile hosts to have IPv6 connectivity wherever they are, by having
   the TSP client send updated information of the new environment to the
   TSP server, when a change occurs.  Together with NAT discovery and
   traversal, the mobile host can be always IPv6 connected wherever it
   is.

   Mobile here means only the change of IPv4 address.  Mobile-IP
   mechanisms and fast hand-off take care of additional constraints in
   mobile environments.

   Mobile networks share the applicability of the mobile hosts.
   Moreover, in the TSP framework, they also keep their prefix
   assignment and can control the routing.  NAT discovery can also be
   used.

7.  IANA Considerations

   A tunnel type registry should be setup by IANA.  The following
   strings are defined in this document: "v6v4" for IPv6 in IPv4
   encapsulation (using IPv4 protocol 41) "v6udpv4" for IPv6 in UDP in
   IPv4 encapsulation "v6anyv4" for IPv6 in IPv4 or IPv6 in UDP in IPv4
   encapsulation "v4v6" for IPv4 in IPv6 encapsulation.

   Details on the registration procedure for new tokens TBD.

   IANA assigned 3653 as the TSP port number.

8.  Security Considerations

   Authentication of the TSP session uses the SASL[RFC2222] framework,



Blanchet & Parent       Expires November 13, 2005              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)              May 2005


   where the authentication mechanism is negotiated between the client
   and the server.  The framework enables to use the level of
   authentication needed for securing the session, based on the
   policies.

   Static tunnels are created when the TSP negotiation is terminated.
   Static tunnels are not open gateways and exhibit less security issues
   than automated tunnels.  Static IPv6 in IPv4 tunnels security
   considerations are described in [RFC2893].

9.  Conclusion

   The Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) is applicable in many environments,
   such as: providers, enterprises, wireless, unmanaged networks, mobile
   hosts and networks.  TSP gives the two tunnel end-points the ability
   to negotiate tunnel parameters, as well as prefix assignment, dns
   delegation and routing in an authenticated session.  It also provides
   IPv4 NAT discovery function by using the most effective
   encapsulation.  It also supports the IPv4 mobility of the nodes.
