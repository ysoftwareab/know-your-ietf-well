                        SRv6 Network Programming
             draft-ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming-28

Abstract

   The SRv6 Network Programming framework enables a network operator or
   an application to specify a packet processing program by encoding a
   sequence of instructions in the IPv6 packet header.

   Each instruction is implemented on one or several nodes in the
   network and identified by an SRv6 Segment Identifier in the packet.

   This document defines the SRv6 Network Programming concept and
   specifies the base set of SRv6 behaviors that enables the creation of
   interoperable overlays with underlay optimization.

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing [RFC8402] leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions,
   called segments.  Each one of these instructions represents a
   function to be called at a specific location in the network.  A
   function is locally defined on the node where it is executed and may
   range from simply moving forward in the Segment List to any complex
   user-defined behavior.  Network programming combines segment routing
   functions, both simple and complex, to achieve a networking objective
   that goes beyond mere packet routing.

   This document defines the SRv6 Network Programming concept and
   specifies the main segment routing behaviors to enable the creation
   of interoperable overlays with underlay optimization.

   The companion document
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-net-pgm-illustration] illustrates the
   concepts defined in this document.

   Familiarity with the Segment Routing Header [RFC8754] is expected.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms used within this document are defined in
   [RFC8402]: Segment Routing, SR Domain, Segment ID (SID), SRv6, SRv6
   SID, SR Policy, Prefix-SID, and Adj-SID.

   The following terms used within this document are defined in
   [RFC8754]: SRH, SR Source Node, Transit Node, SR Segment Endpoint
   Node, Reduced SRH, Segments Left and Last Entry.

   SL: The Segments Left field of the SRH

   FIB: Forwarding Information Base.  A FIB lookup is a lookup in the
   forwarding table.

   SA: Source Address

   DA: Destination Address

   SRv6 SID function: The function part of the SID is an opaque
   identification of a local behavior bound to the SID.  It is formally
   defined in Section 3.1 of this document.

   SRv6 Segment Endpoint behavior: A packet processing behavior executed
   at an SRv6 Segment Endpoint Node.  Section 4 of this document defines
   SRv6 Segment Endpoint behaviors related to traffic-engineering and

   overlay use-cases.  Other behaviors (e.g. service programming) are
   outside the scope of this document.

   An SR Policy is resolved to a SID list.  A SID list is represented as
   <S1, S2, S3> where S1 is the first SID to visit, S2 is the second SID
   to visit and S3 is the last SID to visit along the SR path.

   (SA,DA) (S3, S2, S1; SL) represents an IPv6 packet with:

   - Source Address is SA, Destination Address is DA, and next-header is
     SRH.

   - SRH with SID list <S1, S2, S3> with Segments Left = SL.

   - Note the difference between the <> and () symbols: <S1, S2, S3>
     represents a SID list where S1 is the first SID and S3 is the last
     SID to traverse.  (S3, S2, S1; SL) represents the same SID list but
     encoded in the SRH format where the rightmost SID in the SRH is the
     first SID and the leftmost SID in the SRH is the last SID.  When
     referring to an SR policy in a high-level use-case, it is simpler
     to use the <S1, S2, S3> notation.  When referring to an
     illustration of the detailed packet behavior, the (S3, S2, S1; SL)
     notation is more convenient.

   - The payload of the packet is omitted.

   Per-VRF VPN label: a single label for the entire VRF that is shared
   by all routes from that VRF ([RFC4364] Section 4.3.2)

   Per-CE VPN label: a single label for each attachment circuit that is
   shared by all routes with the same "outgoing attachment circuit"
   ([RFC4364] Section 4.3.2)

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SRv6 SID

   RFC8402 defines an SRv6 Segment Identifier as an IPv6 address
   explicitly associated with the segment.

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   When an SRv6 SID is in the Destination Address field of an IPv6
   header of a packet, it is routed through Transit Nodes in an IPv6
   network as an IPv6 address.

   Its processing is defined in [RFC8754] section 4.3 and reproduced
   here as a reminder.

      Without constraining the details of an implementation, the SR
      segment endpoint node creates Forwarding Information Base (FIB)
      entries for its local SIDs.

      When an SRv6-capable node receives an IPv6 packet, it performs a
      longest-prefix-match lookup on the packet's destination address.
      This lookup can return any of the following:

      * A FIB entry that represents a locally instantiated SRv6 SID

      * A FIB entry that represents a local interface, not locally
        instantiated as an SRv6 SID

      * A FIB entry that represents a nonlocal route

      * No Match

   Section 4 of this document defines a new set of SRv6 SID behaviors in
   addition to that defined in [RFC8754] Section 4.3.1.

3.1.  SID Format

   This document defines an SRv6 SID as consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG,
   where a locator (LOC) is encoded in the L most significant bits of
   the SID, followed by F bits of function (FUNCT) and A bits of
   arguments (ARG).  L, the locator length, is flexible, and an operator
   is free to use the locator length of their choice.  F and A may be
   any value as long as L+F+A <= 128.  When L+F+A is less than 128 then
   the remaining bits of the SID MUST be zero.

   A locator may be represented as B:N where B is the SRv6 SID block
   (IPv6 prefix allocated for SRv6 SIDs by the operator) and N is the
   identifier of the parent node instantiating the SID.

   When the LOC part of the SRv6 SIDs is routable, it leads to the node
   which instantiates the SID.

   The FUNCT is an opaque identification of a local behavior bound to
   the SID.

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   The term "function" refers to the bit-string in the SRv6 SID.  The
   term "behavior" identifies the behavior bound to the SID.  Some
   behaviors are defined in Section 4 of this document.

   An SRv6 Segment Endpoint Behavior may require additional information
   for its processing (e.g. related to the flow or service).  This
   information may be encoded in the ARG bits of the SID.

   In such a case, the semantics and format of the ARG bits are defined
   as part of the SRv6 endpoint behavior specification.

   The ARG value of a routed SID SHOULD remain constant among packets in
   a given flow.  Varying ARG values among packets in a flow may result
   in different ECMP hashing and cause re-ordering.

3.2.  SID Allocation within an SR domain

   Locators are assigned consistent with IPv6 infrastructure allocation.
   For example, a network operator may:

   o  Assign block B::/48 to the SR domain

   o  Assign a unique B:N::/64 block to each SRv6-enabled node in the
      domain

   As an example, one mobile service provider has commercially deployed
   SRv6 across more than 1000 commercial routers and 1800 whitebox
   routers.  All these devices are enabled for SRv6 and advertise SRv6
   SIDs.  The provider historically deployed IPv6 and assigned
   infrastructure addresses from ULA space [RFC4193].  They specifically
   allocated three /48 prefixes (Country X, Country Y, Country Z) to
   support their SRv6 infrastructure.  From those /48 prefixes each
   router was assigned a /64 prefix from which all SIDs of that router
   are allocated.

   In another example, a large mobile and fixed-line service provider
   has commercially deployed SRv6 in their country-wide network.  This
   provider is assigned a /20 prefix by an RIR (Regional Internet
   Registry).  They sub-allocated a few /48 prefixes to their
   infrastructure to deploy SRv6.  Each router is assigned a /64 prefix
   from which all SIDs of that router are allocated.

   IPv6 address consumption in both these examples is minimal,
   representing less than one billionth and one millionth of the
   available address space, respectively.

   A service provider receiving the current minimum allocation of a /32
   from an RIR may assign a /48 prefix to their infrastructure deploying



Filsfils, et al.          Expires July 2, 2021                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   SRv6, and subsequently allocate /64 prefixes for SIDs at each SRv6
   node.  The /48 assignment is one sixty-five thousandth (1/2^16) of
   the usable IPv6 address space available for assignment by the
   provider.

   When an operator instantiates a SID at a node, they specify a SID
   value B:N:FUNCT and the behavior bound to the SID using one of the
   SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint of the registry defined in this
   document (see Table 4).

   The node advertises the SID, B:N:FUNCT, in the control-plane (see
   Section 8) together with the SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint
   identifying the behavior of the SID.

   An SR Source Node cannot infer the behavior by examination of the
   FUNCT value of a SID.

   Therefore, the SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint is advertised along
   with the SID in the control plane.

   An SR Source Node uses the SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint to map
   the received SID (B:N:FUNCT) to a behavior.

   An SR Source Node selects a desired behavior at an advertising node
   by selecting the SID (B:N:FUNCT) advertised with the desired
   behavior.

   As an example, a network operator may:

   o  Assign an SRv6 SID block 2001:db8:bbbb::/48 from their in-house
      operation block for their SRv6 infrastructure

   o  Assign an SRv6 Locator 2001:db8:bbbb:3::/64 to one particular
      router, for example Router 3, in their SR Domain

   o  At Router 3, within the locator 2001:db8:bbbb:3::/64, the network
      operator or the router performs dynamic assignment for:

      *  Function 0x0100 associated with the behavior End.X (Endpoint
         with cross-connect) between router 3 and its connected neighbor
         router, for example Router 4.  This function is encoded as
         16-bit value and has no arguments (F=16, A=0).
         This SID is advertised in the control plane as
         2001:db8:bbbb:3:100:: with SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint
         value of 5.

      *  Function 0x0101 associated with the behavior End.X (Endpoint
         with cross-connect) between router 3 and its connected neighbor

         router, for example Router 2.  This function is encoded as
         16-bit value and has no arguments (F=16, A=0).
         This SID is advertised in the control plane as
         2001:db8:bbbb:3:101:: with SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint
         value of 5.

   These examples do not preclude any other IPv6 addressing allocation
   scheme.

3.3.  SID Reachability

   Most often, the node N would advertise IPv6 prefix(es) matching the
   LOC parts covering its SIDs or shorter-mask prefix.  The distribution
   of these advertisements and calculation of their reachability are
   specific to the routing protocol and are outside of the scope of this
   document.

   An SRv6 SID is said to be routed if its SID belongs to an IPv6 prefix
   advertised via a routing protocol.  An SRv6 SID that does not fulfill
   this condition is non-routed.

   Let's provide a classic illustration:

   Node N is configured explicitly with two SIDs: 2001:db8:b:1:100:: and
   2001:db8:b:2:101::.

   The network learns about a path to 2001:db8:b:1::/64 via the IGP and
   hence a packet destined to 2001:db8:b:1:100:: would be routed up to
   N.  The network does not learn about a path to 2001:db8:b:2::/64 via
   the IGP and hence a packet destined to 2001:db8:b:2:101:: would not
   be routed up to N.

   A packet could be steered through a non-routed SID 2001:db8:b:2:101::
   by using a SID list <...,2001:db8:b:1:100::,2001:db8:b:2:101::,...>
   where the non-routed SID is preceded by a routed SID to the same
   node.  A packet could also be steered to a node instantiating a non-
   routed SID by preceding it in the SID-list with an Adjacency SID to
   that node.  Routed and non-routed SRv6 SIDs are the SRv6
   instantiation of global and local segments, respectively [RFC8402].

   The list is not exhaustive.  In practice, any behavior can be
   attached to a local SID: e.g. a node N can bind a SID to a local VM
   or container which can apply any complex processing on the packet,
   provided there is a behavior codepoint allocated for the processing.

   When an SRv6-capable node (N) receives an IPv6 packet whose
   destination address matches a FIB entry that represents a locally
   instantiated SRv6 SID (S), the IPv6 header chain is processed as
   defined in Section 4 of [RFC8200].  For SRv6 SIDs associated with an
   Endpoint Behavior defined in this document, the SRH and Upper-layer
   Header are processed as defined in the following subsections.

   The pseudocode describing these behaviors details local processing at
   a node.  An implementation of the pseudocode is compliant as long as
   the externally observable wire protocol is as described by the
   pseudocode.

   Section 4.16 defines flavors of some of these behaviors.

   Section 10.2 of this document defines the IANA Registry used to
   maintain all these behaviors as well as future ones defined in other
   documents.

4.1.  End: Endpoint

   The Endpoint behavior ("End" for short) is the most basic behavior.
   It is the instantiation of a Prefix-SID [RFC8402].


   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a local End SID,
   N does:

   S01. When an SRH is processed {
   S02.   If (Segments Left == 0) {
   S03.      Stop processing the SRH, and proceed to process the next
                header in the packet, whose type is identified by
                the Next Header field in the routing header.
   S04.   }
   S05.   If (IPv6 Hop Limit <= 1) {
   S06.      Send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the Source Address,
                Code 0 (Hop limit exceeded in transit),
                interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.
   S07.   }
   S08.   max_LE = (Hdr Ext Len / 2) - 1
   S09.   If ((Last Entry > max_LE) or (Segments Left > Last Entry+1)) {
   S10.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,
                Code 0 (Erroneous header field encountered),
                Pointer set to the Segments Left field,
                interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.

   S11.   }
   S12.   Decrement IPv6 Hop Limit by 1
   S13.   Decrement Segments Left by 1
   S14.   Update IPv6 DA with Segment List[Segments Left]
   S15.   Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup and
             transmission to the new destination
   S16. }

   Notes:
   The End behavior operates on the same FIB table (i.e. identified by
   VRF or L3 relay id) associated to the packet.  Hence the FIB lookup
   on line S15 is done in the same FIB table as the ingress interface.

4.1.1.  Upper-Layer Header

   When processing the Upper-layer Header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End SID, N does:







Filsfils, et al.          Expires July 2, 2021                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   S01. If (Upper-Layer Header type is allowed by local configuration) {
   S02.   Proceed to process the Upper-layer Header
   S03. } Else {
   S04.   Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,
             Code 4 (SR Upper-layer Header Error),
             Pointer set to the offset of the Upper-layer Header,
             Interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.
   S05  }

   Allowing processing of specific Upper-Layer Headers types is useful
   for OAM.  As an example, an operator might permit pinging of SIDs.
   To do this they may enable local configuration to allow Upper-layer
   Header type 58 (ICMPv6).

   It is RECOMMENDED that an implementation of local configuration only
   allows Upper-layer Header processing of types that do not result in
   the packet being forwarded (e.g.  ICMPv6).

4.2.  End.X: Layer-3 Cross-Connect

   The "Endpoint with cross-connect to an array of layer-3 adjacencies"
   behavior (End.X for short) is a variant of the End behavior.

   It is the SRv6 instantiation of an Adjacency-SID [RFC8402] and its
   main use is for traffic-engineering policies.

   Any SID instance of this behavior is associated with a set, J, of one
   or more Layer-3 adjacencies.


   When N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local End.X SID,
   the line S15 from the End processing is replaced by the following:

   S15.   Submit the packet to the IPv6 module for transmission
             to the new destination via a member of J

   Notes:
   S15.  If the set J contains several L3 adjacencies, then one element
   of the set is selected based on a hash of the packet's header (see
   Section 7).


   If a node N has 30 outgoing interfaces to 30 neighbors, usually the
   operator would explicitly instantiate 30 End.X SIDs at N: one per
   layer-3 adjacency to a neighbor.  Potentially, more End.X could be
   explicitly defined (groups of layer-3 adjacencies to the same
   neighbor or to different neighbors).




Filsfils, et al.          Expires July 2, 2021                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   Note that if N has an outgoing interface bundle I to a neighbor Q
   made of 10 member links, N might allocate up to 11 End.X local SIDs:
   one for the bundle itself and then up to one for each Layer-2 member
   link.  The flows steered using the End.X SID corresponding to the
   bundle itself get load balanced across the member links via hashing
   while the flows steered using the End.X SID corresponding to a member
   link get steered over that specific member link alone.


   When the End.X behavior is associated with a BGP Next-Hop, it is the
   SRv6 instantiation of the BGP Peering Segments [RFC8402].



   When processing the Upper-layer Header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End.X SID, process the packet as per
   Section 4.1.1.

4.3.  End.T: Specific IPv6 Table Lookup

   The "Endpoint with specific IPv6 table lookup" behavior (End.T for
   short) is a variant of the End behavior.

   The End.T behavior is used for multi-table operation in the core.
   For this reason, an instance of the End.T behavior is associated with
   an IPv6 FIB table T.


   When N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local End.T SID,
   the line S15 from the End processing is replaced by the following:

   S15.1.   Set the packet's associated FIB table to T
   S15.2.   Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup and
              transmission to the new destination

   When processing the Upper-layer Header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End.T SID, process the packet as per
   Section 4.1.1.

4.4.  End.DX6: Decapsulation and IPv6 Cross-Connect

   The "Endpoint with decapsulation and cross-connect to an array of
   IPv6 adjacencies" behavior (End.DX6 for short) is a variant of the
   End.X behavior.

   One of the applications of the End.DX6 behavior is the L3VPNv6 use-
   case where a FIB lookup in a specific tenant table at the egress

   Provider Edge (PE) is not required.  This is equivalent to the per-CE
   VPN label in MPLS [RFC4364].

   The End.DX6 SID MUST be the last segment in a SR Policy, and it is
   associated with one or more L3 IPv6 adjacencies J.


   When N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local End.DX6 SID,
   N does:

   S01. When an SRH is processed {
   S02.   If (Segments Left != 0) {
   S03.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,
                Code 0 (Erroneous header field encountered),
                Pointer set to the Segments Left field,
                interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.
   S04.   }
   S05.   Proceed to process the next header in the packet
   S06. }


   When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End.DX6 SID, N does:

   S01. If (Upper-Layer Header type == 41(IPv6) ) {
   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S03.    Forward the exposed IPv6 packet to the L3 adjacency J
   S04. } Else {
   S05.    Process as per Section 4.1.1
   S06. }

   Notes:
   S01. 41 refers to IPv6 encapsulation as defined by IANA allocation
   for Internet Protocol Numbers.
   S03.  If the End.DX6 SID is bound to an array of L3 adjacencies, then
   one entry of the array is selected based on the hash of the packet's
   header (see Section 7).

4.5.  End.DX4: Decapsulation and IPv4 Cross-Connect

   The "Endpoint with decapsulation and cross-connect to an array of
   IPv4 adjacencies" behavior (End.DX4 for short) is a variant of the
   End.X behavior.

   One of the applications of the End.DX4 behavior is the L3VPNv4 use-
   case where a FIB lookup in a specific tenant table at the egress PE
   is not required.  This is equivalent to the per-CE VPN label in MPLS
   [RFC4364].

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   The End.DX4 SID MUST be the last segment in a SR Policy, and it is
   associated with one or more L3 IPv4 adjacencies J.


   When N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local End.DX4 SID,
   N does:

   S01. When an SRH is processed {
   S02.   If (Segments Left != 0) {
   S03.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,
                Code 0 (Erroneous header field encountered),
                Pointer set to the Segments Left field,
                interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.
   S04.   }
   S05.   Proceed to process the next header in the packet
   S06. }


   When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End.DX4 SID, N does:

   S01. If (Upper-Layer Header type == 4(IPv4) ) {
   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S03.    Forward the exposed IPv4 packet to the L3 adjacency J
   S04. } Else {
   S05.    Process as per Section 4.1.1
   S06. }

   Notes:
   S01. 4 refers to IPv4 encapsulation as defined by IANA allocation for
   Internet Protocol Numbers
   S03.  If the End.DX4 SID is bound to an array of L3 adjacencies, then
   one entry of the array is selected based on the hash of the packet's
   header (see Section 7).

4.6.  End.DT6: Decapsulation and Specific IPv6 Table Lookup

   The "Endpoint with decapsulation and specific IPv6 table lookup"
   behavior (End.DT6 for short) is a variant of the End.T behavior.

   One of the applications of the End.DT6 behavior is the L3VPNv6 use-
   case where a FIB lookup in a specific tenant table at the egress PE
   is required.  This is equivalent to the per-VRF VPN label in MPLS
   [RFC4364].

   Note that an End.DT6 may be defined for the main IPv6 table in which
   case an End.DT6 supports the equivalent of an IPv6inIPv6
   decapsulation (without VPN/tenant implication).

   The End.DT6 SID MUST be the last segment in a SR Policy, and a SID
   instance is associated with an IPv6 FIB table T.


   When N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local End.DT6 SID,
   N does:

   S01. When an SRH is processed {
   S02.   If (Segments Left != 0) {
   S03.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,

   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers

4.12.  End.DT2M: Decapsulation and L2 Table Flooding

   The "Endpoint with decapsulation and specific L2 table flooding"
   behavior (End.DT2M for short) is a variant of the End.DT2U behavior.

   Two of the applications of the End.DT2M behavior are the EVPN
   Bridging of broadcast, unknown and multicast (BUM) traffic with
   Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) filtering [RFC7432] and the EVPN
   ETREE [RFC8317]use-cases.

   Any SID instance of this behavior is associated with a L2 table T.
   The behavior also takes an argument: "Arg.FE2".  This argument
   provides a local mapping to ESI for split-horizon filtering of the
   received traffic to exclude specific OIF (or set of OIFs) from L2
   table T flooding.  The allocation of the argument values is local to
   the SR Endpoint Node instantiating this behavior and the signaling of
   the argument to other nodes for the EVPN functionality occurs via
   control plane.


   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a local End.DT2M
   SID, the processing is identical to the End.DX2 behavior except for
   the Upper-layer header processing which is as follows:

   S01. If (Upper-Layer Header type == 143(Ethernet) ) {
   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S03.    Learn the exposed MAC Source Address in L2 Table T
   S04.    Forward via all L2OIFs excluding those associated by the
              identifier Arg.FE2
   S05. } Else {
   S06.    Process as per Section 4.1.1
   S07. }

   Notes:
   S01.  IANA has allocated the Internet Protocol number 143 to Ethernet
   (see Section 10.1).
   S03.  In EVPN [RFC7432], the learning of the exposed MAC Source
   Address is done via control plane.  In L2VPN VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762]
   reachability is obtained by standard learning bridge functions in the
   data plane.

4.13.  End.B6.Encaps: Endpoint Bound to an SRv6 Policy w/ Encaps

   This is a variation of the End behavior.

   One of its applications is to express scalable traffic-engineering
   policies across multiple domains.  It is one of the SRv6
   instantiations of a Binding SID [RFC8402].

   Any SID instance of this behavior is associated with an SR Policy B
   and a source address A.


   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a local
   End.B6.Encaps SID, N does:

  S01. When an SRH is processed {
  S02.   If (Segments Left == 0) {
  S03.      Stop processing the SRH, and proceed to process the next
               header in the packet, whose type is identified by
               the Next Header field in the routing header.
  S04.   }
  S05.   If (IPv6 Hop Limit <= 1) {
  S06.      Send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the Source Address,
               Code 0 (Hop limit exceeded in transit),
               interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.
  S07.   }
  S08.   max_LE = (Hdr Ext Len / 2) - 1
  S09.   If ((Last Entry > max_LE) or (Segments Left > (Last Entry+1)) {
  S10.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,
               Code 0 (Erroneous header field encountered),
               Pointer set to the Segments Left field,
               interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.
  S11.   }
  S12.   Decrement IPv6 Hop Limit by 1
  S13.   Decrement Segments Left by 1
  S14.   Update IPv6 DA with Segment List[Segments Left]
  S15.   Push a new IPv6 header with its own SRH containing B
  S16.   Set the outer IPv6 SA to A
  S17.   Set the outer IPv6 DA to the first SID of B
  S18.   Set the outer Payload Length, Traffic Class, Flow Label,
            Hop Limit and Next-Header fields
  S19.   Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup and
            transmission to the new destination
  S20. }

   Notes:
   S15.  The SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy B only contains one
   SID and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.
   S18.  The Payload Length, Traffic Class, Hop Limit and Next-Header
   fields are set as per [RFC2473].  The Flow Label is computed as per
   [RFC6437].


   When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End.B6.Encaps SID, process the
   packet as per Section 4.1.1.

4.14.  End.B6.Encaps.Red: End.B6.Encaps with Reduced SRH

   This is an optimization of the End.B6.Encaps behavior.

   End.B6.Encaps.Red reduces the size of the SRH by one SID by excluding
   the first SID in the SRH of the new IPv6 header.  Thus, the first
   segment is only placed in the IPv6 Destination Address of the new
   IPv6 header and the packet is forwarded according to it.

   The SRH Last Entry field is set as defined in Section 4.1.1 of
   [RFC8754].

   The SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy only contains one SID and
   there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.

4.15.  End.BM: Endpoint Bound to an SR-MPLS Policy

   The "Endpoint bound to an SR-MPLS Policy" is a variant of the End
   behavior.

   The End.BM behavior is required to express scalable traffic-
   engineering policies across multiple domains where some domains
   support the MPLS instantiation of Segment Routing.  This is an SRv6
   instantiation of an SR-MPLS Binding SID [RFC8402].

   Any SID instance of this behavior is associated with an SR-MPLS
   Policy B.


   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a local End.BM
   SID, N does:

   When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End.BM SID, process the packet as
   per Section 4.1.1.

4.16.  Flavors

   The Penultimate Segment Pop of the SRH (PSP), Ultimate Segment Pop of
   the SRH (USP) and Ultimate Segment Decapsulation (USD) flavors are
   variants of the End, End.X and End.T behaviors.  The End, End.X and
   End.T behaviors can support these flavors either individually or in
   combinations.

4.16.1.  PSP: Penultimate Segment Pop of the SRH

4.16.1.1.  Guidelines

   SR Segment Endpoint Nodes advertise the SIDs instantiated on them via
   control plane protocols as described in Section 8.  Different
   behavior ids are allocated for flavored and unflavored SIDs (see
   Table 4).




Filsfils, et al.          Expires July 2, 2021                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   An SR Segment Endpoint Node that offers both PSP and non-PSP flavored
   behavior advertises them as two different SIDs.

   The SR Segment Endpoint Node only advertises the PSP flavor if the
   operator enables this capability at the node.

   The PSP operation is deterministically controlled by the SR Source
   Node.

   A PSP-flavored SID is used by the Source SR Node when it needs to
   instruct the penultimate SR Segment Endpoint Node listed in the SRH
   to remove the SRH from the IPv6 header.

4.16.1.2.  Definition

   SR Segment Endpoint Nodes receive the IPv6 packet with the
   Destination Address field of the IPv6 Header equal to its SID
   address.

   A penultimate SR Segment Endpoint Node is one that, as part of the
   SID processing, copies the last SID from the SRH into the IPv6
   Destination Address and decrements the Segments Left value from one
   to zero.

   The PSP operation only takes place at a penultimate SR Segment
   Endpoint Node and does not happen at any Transit Node.  When a SID of
   PSP-flavor is processed at a non-penultimate SR Segment Endpoint
   Node, the PSP behavior is not performed as described in the
   pseudocode below since Segments Left would not be zero.

   The SRH processing of the End, End.X and End.T behaviors are
   modified: after the instruction "S14.  Update IPv6 DA with Segment
   List[Segments Left]" is executed, the following instructions must be
   executed as well:

S14.1.   If (Segments Left == 0) {
S14.2.      Update the Next Header field in the preceding header to the
               Next Header value from the SRH
S14.3.      Decrease the IPv6 header Payload Length by 8*(Hdr Ext Len+1)
S14.4.      Remove the SRH from the IPv6 extension header chain
S14.5.   }

   The usage of PSP does not increase the MTU of the IPv6 packet and
   hence does not have any impact on the PMTU discovery mechanism.

   As a reminder, [RFC8754] defines in section 5 the SR Deployment Model
   within the SR Domain [RFC8402].  Within this framework, the
   Authentication Header (AH) is not used to secure the SRH as described



Filsfils, et al.          Expires July 2, 2021                 [Page 26]

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


   in Section 7.5 of [RFC8754].  Hence, the discussion of applicability
   of PSP along with AH usage is beyond the scope of this document.

   In the context of this specification, the End, End.X and End.T
   behaviors with PSP do not contravene Section 4 of [RFC8200] because
   the destination address of the incoming packet is the address of the
   node executing the behavior.

4.16.1.3.  Use-case

   One use-case for the PSP functionality is streamlining the operation
   of an egress border router.

                      Figure 1: PSP use-case topology

   In the above illustration, for a packet sent from iPE to ePE, node R3
   is an intermediate traffic engineering waypoint and is the
   penultimate segment endpoint router; the node that copies the last
   segment from the SRH into the IPv6 Destination Address and decrements
   segments left to 0.  The SDN controller knows that no other node
   after R3 needs to inspect the SRH, and it instructs R3 to remove the
   exhausted SRH from the packet by using a PSP-flavored SID.

   The benefits for the egress PE are straightforward:

   -as part of the decapsulation process the egress PE is required to
    parse and remove fewer bytes from the packet.

   -if a lookup on an upper-layer IP header is required (e.g. per-VRF
    VPN), the header is more likely to be within the memory accessible

    to the lookup engine in the forwarding ASIC (Application-specific
    integrated circuit).

4.16.2.  USP: Ultimate Segment Pop of the SRH

   The SRH processing of the End, End.X and End.T behaviors are
   modified: the instructions S02-S04 are substituted by the following
   ones:

S02.     If (Segments Left == 0) {
S03.1.      Update the Next Header field in the preceding header to the
               Next Header value of the SRH
S03.2.      Decrease the IPv6 header Payload Length by 8*(Hdr Ext Len+1)
S03.3.      Remove the SRH from the IPv6 extension header chain
S03.4.      Proceed to process the next header in the packet
S04.     }

   One of the applications of the USP flavor is when a packet with an
   SRH is destined to an application on hosts with smartNICs
   implementing SRv6.  The USP flavor is used to remove the consumed SRH
   from the extension header chain before sending the packet to the
   host.

4.16.3.  USD: Ultimate Segment Decapsulation

   The Upper-layer header processing of the End, End.X and End.T
   behaviors are modified as follows:

   End:
   S01. If (Upper-layer Header type == 41(IPv6) ) {
   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S03.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup and
              transmission to the new destination
   S04. } Else if (Upper-layer Header type == 4(IPv4) ) {
   S05.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S06.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv4 FIB lookup and
              transmission to the new destination
   S07. Else {

   End.T:
   S01. If (Upper-layer Header type == 41(IPv6) ) {
   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S03.    Set the packet's associated FIB table to T
   S04.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup and
              transmission to the new destination
   S05. } Else if (Upper-layer Header type == 4(IPv4) ) {
   S06.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S07.    Set the packet's associated FIB table to T
   S08.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv4 FIB lookup and
              transmission to the new destination
   S09. Else {
   S10.    Process as per Section 4.1.1
   S11. }

   End.X:
   S01. If (Upper-layer Header type == 41(IPv6) ||
             Upper-layer Header type == 4(IPv4) ) {
   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 Header with all its extension headers
   S03.    Forward the exposed IP packet to the L3 adjacency J
   S04. } Else {
   S05.    Process as per Section 4.1.1
   S06. }

   One of the applications of the USD flavor is the case of TI-LFA in P
   routers with encapsulation.  The USD flavor allows the last Segment
   Endpoint Node in the repair path list to decapsulate the IPv6 header
   added at the TI-LFA Point of Local Repair and forward the inner
   packet.

   behaviors.

   This list is not exhaustive and future documents may define
   additional behaviors.

Internet-Draft          SRv6 Network Programming           December 2020


5.1.  H.Encaps: SR Headend with Encapsulation in an SRv6 Policy

   Node N receives two packets P1=(A, B2) and P2=(A,B2)(B3, B2, B1;
   SL=1).  B2 is neither a local address nor SID of N.

   Node N is configured with an IPv6 Address T (e.g. assigned to its
   loopback).

   N steers the transit packets P1 and P2 into an SR Policy with a
   Source Address T and a Segment list <S1, S2, S3>.

   The H.Encaps encapsulation behavior is defined as follows:

   S01.   Push an IPv6 header with its own SRH
   S02.   Set outer IPv6 SA = T and outer IPv6 DA to the first SID
             in the segment list
   S03.   Set outer Payload Length, Traffic Class, Hop Limit and
             Flow Label fields
   S04.   Set the outer Next-Header value
   S05.   Decrement inner IPv6 Hop Limit or IPv4 TTL
   S06.   Submit the packet to the IPv6 module for transmission to S1

   Note:
   S03: As described in [RFC2473] and [RFC6437].


   After the H.Encaps behavior, P1' and P2' respectively look like:

   - (T, S1) (S3, S2, S1; SL=2) (A, B2)

   - (T, S1) (S3, S2, S1; SL=2) (A, B2) (B3, B2, B1; SL=1)

   The received packet is encapsulated unmodified (with the exception of
   the IPv4 TTL or IPv6 Hop Limit that is decremented as described in
   [RFC2473]).

   The H.Encaps behavior is valid for any kind of Layer-3 traffic.  This
   behavior is commonly used for L3VPN with IPv4 and IPv6 deployments.
   It may be also used for TI-LFA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] at the point of local repair.

   The push of the SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy only contains
   one segment and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.

5.2.  H.Encaps.Red: H.Encaps with Reduced Encapsulation

   The H.Encaps.Red behavior is an optimization of the H.Encaps
   behavior.

   H.Encaps.Red reduces the length of the SRH by excluding the first SID
   in the SRH of the pushed IPv6 header.  The first SID is only placed
   in the Destination Address field of the pushed IPv6 header.

   After the H.Encaps.Red behavior, P1' and P2' respectively look like:

   - (T, S1) (S3, S2; SL=2) (A, B2)

   - (T, S1) (S3, S2; SL=2) (A, B2) (B3, B2, B1; SL=1)

   The push of the SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy only contains
   one segment and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.

5.3.  H.Encaps.L2: H.Encaps Applied to Received L2 Frames

   The H.Encaps.L2 behavior encapsulates a received Ethernet
   [IEEE.802.3_2018] frame and its attached VLAN header, if present, in
   an IPv6 packet with an SRH.  The Ethernet frame becomes the payload
   of the new IPv6 packet.

   The Next Header field of the SRH MUST be set to 143.

   The push of the SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy only contains
   one segment and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.

   The encapsulating node MUST remove the preamble (if any) and frame
   check sequence (FCS) from the Ethernet frame upon encapsulation and
   the decapsulating node MUST regenerate, as required, the preamble and
   FCS before forwarding Ethernet frame.

5.4.  H.Encaps.L2.Red: H.Encaps.Red Applied to Received L2 frames

   The H.Encaps.L2.Red behavior is an optimization of the H.Encaps.L2
   behavior.

   H.Encaps.L2.Red reduces the length of the SRH by excluding the first
   SID in the SRH of the pushed IPv6 header.  The first SID is only
   places in the Destination Address field of the pushed IPv6 header.

   The push of the SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy only contains
   one segment and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.

6.  Counters

   A node supporting this document SHOULD implement a pair of traffic
   counters (one for packets and one for bytes) per local SID entry, for
   traffic that matched that SID and was processed successfully (i.e.
   packets which generate ICMP Error Messages or are dropped are not
   counted).  The retrieval of these counters from MIB, NETCONF/YANG or
   any other data structure is outside the scope of this document.

7.  Flow-based Hash Computation

   When a flow-based selection within a set needs to be performed, the
   IPv6 Source Address, the IPv6 Destination Address and the IPv6 Flow
   Label of the outer IPv6 header MUST be included in the flow-based
   hash.

   This occurs when a FIB lookup is performed and multiple ECMP paths
   exist to the updated destination address.

   This occurs when End.X, End.DX4, or End.DX6 are bound to an array of
   adjacencies.

   This occurs when the packet is steered in an SR policy whose selected
   path has multiple SID lists.

   Additionally, any transit router in an SRv6 domain includes the outer
   flow label in its ECMP flow-based hash [RFC6437].

8.  Control Plane

   In an SDN environment, one expects the controller to explicitly
   provision the SIDs and/or discover them as part of a service
   discovery function.  Applications residing on top of the controller
   could then discover the required SIDs and combine them to form a
   distributed network program.

   The concept of "SRv6 network programming" refers to the capability
   for an application to encode any complex program as a set of
   individual functions distributed through the network.  Some functions
   relate to underlay SLA, others to overlay/tenant, others to complex
   applications residing in VM and containers.

   While not necessary for an SDN control plane, the remainder of this
   section provides a high-level illustrative overview of how control-
   plane protocols may be involved with SRv6.  Their specification is
   outside the scope of this document.

8.1.  IGP

   The End, End.T and End.X SIDs express topological behaviors and hence
   are expected to be signaled in the IGP together with the flavors PSP,
   USP and USD.  The IGP should also advertise the maximum SRv6 SID
   depth (MSD) capability of the node for each type of SRv6 operation -
   in particular, the SR source (e.g.  H.Encaps), intermediate endpoint
   (e.g.  End, End.X) and final endpoint (e.g.  End.DX4, End.DT6)
   behaviors.  These capabilities are factored in by an SR Source Node
   (or a controller) during the SR Policy computation.

   The presence of SIDs in the IGP does not imply any routing semantics
   to the addresses represented by these SIDs.  The routing reachability
   to an IPv6 address is solely governed by the non-SID-related IGP
   prefix reachability information that includes locators.  Routing is
   neither governed nor influenced in any way by a SID advertisement in
   the IGP.

   These SIDs provide important topological behaviors for the IGP to
   build FRR solutions based on TI-LFA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] and for TE processes relying
   on IGP topology database to build SR policies.

8.2.  BGP-LS

   BGP-LS provides the functionality for topology discovery that
   includes the SRv6 capabilities of the nodes, their locators and
   locally instantiated SIDs.  This enables controllers or applications
   to build an inter-domain topology that can be used for computation of
   SR Policies using the SRv6 SIDs.

8.3.  BGP IP/VPN/EVPN

   The End.DX4, End.DX6, End.DT4, End.DT6, End.DT46, End.DX2, End.DX2V,
   End.DT2U and End.DT2M SIDs can be signaled in BGP.

   In some scenarios an egress PE advertising a VPN route might wish to
   abstract the specific behavior bound to the SID from the ingress PE
   and other routers in the network.  In such case, the SID may be
   advertised using the Opaque SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint defined
   in Table 4.  The details of such control plane signaling mechanisms
   are out of the scope of this document.

8.4.  Summary

   The following table summarizes behaviors for SIDs that can be
   signaled in which each respective control plane protocol.

             Table 2: SRv6 Policy Headend behaviors signaling

   The previous table describes generic capabilities.  It does not
   describe specific instantiated SR policies.

   For example, a BGP-LS advertisement of H.Encaps behavior would
   describe the capability of node N to perform a H.Encaps behavior.
   Specifically, it would describe how many SIDs could be pushed by N
   without significant performance degradation.


   As a reminder, an SR policy is always assigned a Binding SID
   [RFC8402].  BSIDs are also advertised in BGP-LS as shown in Table 1.

   Hence, the Table 2 only focuses on the generic capabilities related
   to H.Encaps.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for Segment Routing are discussed in
   [RFC8402].  Section 5 of [RFC8754] describes the SR Deployment Model
   and the requirements for securing the SR Domain.  The security
   considerations of [RFC8754] also cover topics such as attack vectors
   and their mitigation mechanisms that also apply the behaviors
   introduced in this document.  Together, they describe the required
   security mechanisms that allow establishment of an SR domain of
   trust.  Having such a well-defined trust boundary is necessary in
   order to operate SRv6-based services for internal traffic while
   preventing any external traffic from accessing or exploiting the
   SRv6-based services.  Care and rigor in IPv6 address allocation for
   use for SRv6 SID allocations and network infrastructure addresses, as
   distinct from IPv6 addresses allocated for end-users/systems (as
   illustrated in Section 5.1 of [RFC8754]), can provide the clear
   distinction between internal and external address space that is
   required to maintain the integrity and security of the SRv6 Domain.
   Additionally, [RFC8754] defines an HMAC TLV permitting SR Endpoint
   Nodes in the SR domain to verify that the SRH applied to a packet was
   selected by an authorized party and to ensure that the segment list
   is not modified after generation, regardless of the number of
   segments in the segment list.  When enabled by local configuration,
   HMAC processing occurs at the beginning of SRH processing as defined
   in [RFC8754] Section 2.1.2.1 .

   This document introduces SRv6 Endpoint and SR Policy Headend
   behaviors for implementation on SRv6 capable nodes in the network.
   The headend policy definition should be consistent with the specific
   behavior used and any local configuration (as specified in
   Section 4.1.1).  As such, this document does not introduce any new
   security considerations.

   The SID Behaviors specified in this document have the same HMAC TLV
   handling and mutability properties of the Flags, Tag, and Segment
   List field as the SID Behavior specified in [RFC8754].

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  Ethernet Next Header Type

   This document requests IANA to allocate, in the "Protocol Numbers"
   registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-
   numbers.xhtml), a new value for "Ethernet" with the following
   definition: The value 143 in the Next Header field of an IPv6 header

   or any extension header indicates that the payload is an Ethernet
   frame [IEEE.802.3_2018].

   IANA has done a temporary allocation of Protocol Number 143.

10.2.  SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors Registry

   This document requests IANA to create a new top-level registry called
   "Segment Routing Parameters".  This registry is being defined to
   serve as a top-level registry for keeping all other Segment Routing
   sub-registries.

   Additionally, a new sub-registry "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors" is to be
   created under top-level "Segment Routing Parameters" registry.  This
   sub-registry maintains 16-bit identifiers for the SRv6 Endpoint
   behaviors.  This registry is established to provide consistency for
   control plane protocols which need to refer to these behaviors.
   These values are not encoded in the function bits within a SID.

   The range of the registry is 0-65535 (0x0000 - 0xFFFF) and has the
   following registration rules and allocation policies:

   +-------------+---------------+----------------------+--------------+
   | Range       |      Hex      |     Registration     |    Notes     |
