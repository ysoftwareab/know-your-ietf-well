1.  Introduction

   Remote ATtestation procedureS [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] are
   workflows composed of roles and interactions, in which a Verifier
   creates assessments based on evidence about the trustworthiness of an
   Attester's system component characteristics.  The roles _Attester_
   and _Verifier_, as well as the message _Evidence_ are terms defined
   by the RATS Architecture.  The goal of this document is to enable the
   design and adoption of secure conveyance methods for attestation
   evidence from an Attester to a Verifier.
   This document defines three [note: pub/sub & time-based are still
   missing] reference interaction models that describe the conveyance of
   evidence between Attester and Verifier in order to provide the basis
   for reliable and believable appraisal of evidence by a Verifier.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Disambiguation

   The term "Remote Attestation" is a common expression and often
   associated with certain properties.  The term "Remote" in this
   context does not necessarily refer to a remote entity in the scope of
   network topologies or the Internet.  It rather refers to a decoupled
   system or different Types of Environments
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture], which also can be present locally as
   separate system components of a composite device (in a single RATS
   Entity).  Examples include: a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE),
   Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs), as well as other physical or
   logical protected/isolated/shielded Computing Environments.

3.  Scope

   This document focuses on generic interaction models between Verifiers
   and Attesters.  Complementary procedures, duties and functions that
   are required for a complete semantic binding of RATS are not in
   scope.  Examples include: identity establishment, key distribution
   and enrollment, as well as certificate revocation.

   Furthermore, any processes and duties that go beyond carrying out
   remote attestation procedures are out-of-scope.  For instance, using
   the results of a remote attestation that are created by the Verifier,
   e.g., triggering remediation actions or recovery processes, as well
   as the remediation actions and recovery processes themselves, is also
   out-of-scope.

   The definition of Reference Interaction Models for RATS uses the role
   definitions of Attester and Verifier as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].

4.  Normative Prerequisites

   Attester Identity:  The provenance of Attestation Evidence with
      respect to a distinguishable Attesting Environment MUST be correct
      and unambiguous.

Internet-Draft                    REIM                      January 2020


      An Attester Identity MAY be a unique identity, or it MAY be
      included in a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), or it MAY be part of a
      group signature.

   Attestation Evidence:  Attestation Evidence MUST be a set of well-
      formatted and well-protected Claims that an Attester can create
      and convey to a Verifier.

   Attestation Evidence Authenticity:  Attestation Evidence MUST be
      correct and authentic.

      Attestation Evidence, in order to provide proof of authenticity,
      SHOULD be cryptographically associated with an identity document
      (e.g. an X.509 certificate), or SHOULD include a correct and
      unambiguous reference to an accessible identity document.

   Authentication Secret:  An Authentication Secret MUST be available
      exclusively to an Attester's Attesting Environment.  The Attester
      MUST sign Claims with that Authentication Secret, thereby proving
      the authenticity of the Claims included in the signed Attestation
      Evidence.  The Authentication Secret MUST be established before
      RATS can take place.  How it is established is out-of-scope for
      this document.

5.  Remote Attestation Interaction Model

   This section defines the information elements that have to be
   conveyed via a protocol, enabling the conveyance of Evidence between
   Verifier and Attester, as well as the interaction model for a generic
   challenge-response remote attestation scheme.

5.1.  Information Elements

   Attester Identity ('attesterIdentity'):  _mandatory_

      A statement about a distinguishable Attester made by an entity
      without accompanying evidence of its validity, used as proof of
      identity.

   Authentication Secret ID ('authSecID'):  _mandatory_

      An identifier that MUST be associated with the Authentication
      Secret which is used to sign evidence.

   Nonce ('nonce'):  _mandatory_

      The Nonce (number used once) is intended to be unique and
      practically infeasible to guess.  In this reference interaction

Internet-Draft                    REIM                      January 2020


      model the Nonce MUST be provided by the Verifier and MUST be used
      as proof of freshness.  With respect to conveyed evidence, it
      ensures the result of an attestation activity to be created
      recently, e. g. sent or derived by the challenge from the
      Verifier.  As such, the Nonce MUST be part of the signed
      Attestation Evidence that is sent from the Attester to the
      Verifier.

   Claims ('claims'):  _mandatory_

      Claims are assertions that represent characteristics of an
      Attester.  Claims compose attestation evidence and are, for
      example, used to appraise the integrity of an Attester.  Examples
      are Claims about sensor data, policies that are active on the
      entity, versions of composite firmware of a platform, running
      software, routing tables, or information about a local time
      source.

   Reference Claims ('refClaims')  _mandatory_

      Reference Claims are a specific subset of Appraisal Policies as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  Reference Claims are
      used to appraise the Claims received from an Attester via
      appraisal by direct comparison.  For example, Reference Claims MAY
      be Reference Integrity Measurements (RIMs) or assertions that are
      implicitly trusted because they are signed by a trusted authority
      (see Endorsements in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]).  RIMs
      represent (trusted) Claim sets about an Attester's intended
      platform operational state.

   Claim Selection ('claimSelection'):  _optional_

      An Attester MAY provide a selection of Claims in order to reduce
      or increase retrieved assertions to those that are relevant to the
      appraisal policies.  Usually, all available Claims that are
      available to the Attester SHOULD be conveyed.  The Claim Selection
      MAY be composed as complementary signed Claim sets or MAY be
      encapsulated Claims in the signed Attestation Evidence.  An
      Attester MAY decide whether or not to provide all requested Claims
      or not.  An example of a Claim Selection is a Verifier requesting
      (signed) RIMs from an Attester.

   (Signed) Attestation Evidence ('signedAttestationEvidence'):  _mandat
      ory_

      Attestation Evidence consists of the Authentication Secret ID that
      identifies an Authentication Secret, the Attester Identity, the
      Claims, and the Verifier-provided Nonce.  Attestation Evidence



Birkholz & Eckel          Expires July 10, 2020                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    REIM                      January 2020


      MUST cryptographically bind all of those elements.  The
      Attestation Evidence MUST be signed by the Authentication Secret.
      The Authentication Secret MUST be trusted by the Verifier as
      authoritative.

   Attestation Result ('attestationResult'):  _mandatory_

      An Attestation Result is produced by the Verifier as the output of
      the appraisal of Attestation Evidence.  The Attestation Result
      represents Claims about integrity and other characteristics of the
      corresponding Attester.

5.2.  Interaction Model

   The following sequence diagram illustrates the reference remote
   attestation procedure defined by this document.

[Attester]                                                      [Verifier]
    |                                                               |

    |                                                               |
    | <---------- requestEvidence(nonce, authSecID, claimSelection) |
    |                                                               |

    | => claims                                                     |
    |                                                               |

    | => signedAttestationEvidence                                  |
    |                                                               |
    | signedAttestationEvidence ----------------------------------> |
    |                                                               |
    |   appraiseAttestationEvidence(signedAttestationEvidence, refClaims)
    |                                          attestationResult <= |
    |                                                               |


   The remote attestation procedure is initiated by the Verifier,
   sending an attestation request to the Attester.  The attestation
   request consists of a Nonce, a Authentication Secret ID, and a Claim
   Selection.  The Nonce guarantees attestation freshness.  The
   Authentication Secret ID selects the secret with which the Attester
   is requested to sign the Attestation Evidence.  The Claim Selection
   narrows down or increases the amount of received Claims, if required.
   If the Claim Selection is empty, then by default all Claims that are
   available on the Attester MUST be signed and returned as Attestation
   Evidence.  For example, a Verifier may only be requesting a
   particular subset of information about the Attester, such as evidence



Birkholz & Eckel          Expires July 10, 2020                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    REIM                      January 2020


   about BIOS and firmware the Attester booted up with - and not include
   information about all currently running software.

   The Attester, after receiving the attestation request, collects the
   corresponding Claims that have been measured beforehand to compose
   the Attestation Evidence that the Verifier requested.  In the case
   that the Verifier did not provide a Claim Selection, the Attester
   collects all information that can be used as complementary Claims in
   the scope of the semantics of the remote attestation procedure.
   Conclusively, the Attester creates Attestation Evidence by signing
   the Attester Identity, the Claims, and the Nonce with the
   Authentication Secret identified by the Authentication Secret ID.
   The signed Attestation Evidence is transferred back to the Verifier.

   It is crucial at this point that Claims, the Nonce, as well as the
   Attester Identity information MUST be cryptographically bound to the
   signature of the Attestation Evidence.  It is not required for them
   to be present in plain text, though.  Cryptographic blinding MAY be
   used at this point.  For further reference see section Section 8.

   As soon as the Verifier receives the signed Attestation Evidence, it
   verifies the signature, the Attester Identity, the Nonce, and
   appraises the Claims.  This procedure is application-specific and can
   be carried out by comparing the Claims with corresponding Reference
   Claims, e.g., Reference Integrity Measurements (RIMs), or using other
   appraisal policies.  The final output of the Verifier are Attestation
   Results.  Attestation Results constitute new Claims about an
   Attester's properties and characteristics that enables relying
   parties, for example, to assess an Attester's trustworthiness.

6.  Further Context

   Depending on the use cases covered, there can be additional
   requirements.  An exemplary subset is illustrated in this section.

6.1.  Confidentiality

   Confidentiality of exchanged attestation information may be
   desirable.  This requirement usually is present when communication
   takes place over insecure channels, such as the public Internet.  In
   such cases, TLS may be uses as a suitable communication protocol that
   preserves confidentiality.  In private networks, such as carrier
   management networks, it must be evaluated whether or not the
   transport medium is considered confidential.

Internet-Draft                    REIM                      January 2020


6.2.  Mutual Authentication

   In particular use cases mutual authentication may be desirable in
   such a way that a Verifier also needs to prove its identity to the
   Attester, instead of only the Attester proving its identity to the
   Verifier.

6.3.  Hardware-Enforcement/Support

   Depending on the requirements, hardware support for secure storage of
   cryptographic keys, crypto accelerators, or protected or isolated
   execution environments may be useful.  Well-known technologies are
   roots of trusts, such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Physically
   Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Shielded Secrets, or Trusted Executions
   Environments (TEEs).

7.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section as well as references
   to [BCP205] before AUTH48.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [BCP205].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [BCP205], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

7.1.  Implementer

   The open-source implementation was initiated and is maintained by the
   Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology - SIT.

Internet-Draft                    REIM                      January 2020


7.2.  Implementation Name

   The open-source implementation is named "CHAllenge-Response based
   Remote Attestation" or in short: CHARRA.

7.3.  Implementation URL

   The open-source implementation project resource can be located via:
   https://github.com/Fraunhofer-SIT/charra

7.4.  Maturity

   The code's level of maturity is considered to be "prototype".

7.5.  Coverage and Version Compatibility

   The current version (commit '847bcde') is aligned with the exemplary
   specification of the CoAP FETCH bodies defined in section Appendix A
   of this document.

7.6.  License

   The CHARRA project and all corresponding code and data maintained on
   github are provided under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised"
   license.

7.7.  Implementation Dependencies

   The implementation requires the use of the official Trusted Computing
   Group (TCG) open-source Trusted Software Stack (TSS) for the Trusted
   Platform Module (TPM) 2.0.  The corresponding code and data is also
   maintained on github and the project resources can be located via:
   https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/

   The implementation uses the Constrained Application Protocol
   [RFC7252] (http://coap.technology/) and the Concise Binary Object
   Representation [RFC7049] (https://cbor.io/).

7.8.  Contact

   Michael Eckel (michael.eckel@sit.fraunhofer.de)

8.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   In a remote attestation procedure the Verifier or the Attester MAY
   want to cryptographically blind several attributes.  For instance,
   information can be part of the signature after applying a one-way
   function (e. g. a hash function).

Internet-Draft                    REIM                      January 2020


   There is also a possibility to scramble the Nonce or Attester
   Identity with other information that is known to both the Verifier
   and Attester.  A prominent example is the IP address of the Attester
   that usually is known by the Attester itself as well as the Verifier.
   This extra information can be used to scramble the Nonce in order to
   counter certain types of relay attacks.

Appendix A.  CDDL Specification for a simple CoAP Challenge/Response
             Interaction

   The following CDDL specification is an examplary proof-of-concept to
   illustrate a potential implementation of the Reference Interaction
   Model.  The transfer protocol used is CoAP using the FETCH operation.
   The actual resource operated on can be empty.  Both the Challenge
   Message and the Response Message are exchanged via the FETCH Request
   and FETCH Response body.
