Internet-Draft           Deployment Scenarios of S/BC             July 8, 2005



1.  Introduction

The IETF drafts [3] and [4] outline S/BC functions.  The IETF draft [3] 
illustrates two deployment scenarios: Network-Network peering and Access-Network 
Peering. Both of these scenarios use composed S/BC that integrates signaling 
control, media, routing, and management functions into a single (stand alone) 
device.

Although current trend is to deploy standalone or composed S/BC functions in the 
VoIP and IMS networks, there are advantages of deploying S/BC functions in 
decomposed, centralized, or distributed configurations. 

To reduce duplication of various network functions, and to improve scalability 
and efficiency of networks decomposed, centralized, and distributed S/BC 
configurations need to be considered in addition to the current composed 
configuration.
 
This document depicts five S/BC configurations, and their corresponding 
deployment scenarios. The document also briefly discusses merits of these 
architectures. The objective is to depict a provider's architectural 
requirements of S/BC function deployment. The document will help the IETF 
community to understand that S/BC functions need to be studied in holistic 
border protection architecture approach and can be deployed in the network in 
scalable fashion.

2.  Terminology

   
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in [7] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

3.  General Information
  
The Packet Technologies and Systems Committee (PTSC, formerly T1S1) of
Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) is working on 
Developing IP Network-Network Interface (NNI) Interconnect [5] and
Session/Border Control (S/BC) Function specifications[6].A contribution [8] 
portraying examples of conceptual realization was submitted to ATIS-PTSC meeting 
in Montreal, Canada, on June 13, 2005. This document is a revised version of the 
contribution.

4. Definitions


4.1 3GPP 

       The following 3GPP terms are used in this document.
       CSCF: Call Session Control Function
       P-CSCF: Proxy-CSCF
       I-CSCF: Interrogating-CSCF
       BGCF: Breakout Gateway Control Function
       MGCF: Media Gateway Control Function


4.2 Reference Peering Interface

   A network peering interface can be divided into four planes: signaling, 
media, routing, and operation-managment. This document defines modules 
performing these interfaces as Signaling Function (SF), Media Function (MF), 
Routing Function (RF), and Operation & Management Function (OF).

A SF performs the signaling and control functions. A possible example of a SF is 
a SIP Edge-Proxy or a SIP B2BUA. A MF performs media peering. A possible example 
an MF is a Media Relay (MR) or an edge-router. An RF interconnects the routing 
planes of two networks. An example of an RF is an interworking function that 
mediates two similar or dissimilar routing protocols of two networks. Typically, 
an RF is implemented in an MR or edge-router.

5. S/BC Deployment Scenarios

5.1 Composed or Standalone S/BC
      
       The composed or standalone S/BC combines SF, MF, RF, and OF functions 
into a single device. The following figure shows the composed or standalone S/BC 
configuration and its associated network architecture. Some functions such as 
ENUM interoperability (ENUM) module may be located outside of the composed S/BC.

       The advantage of composed S/BC deployment in the network is that one-
device solves all peering issues. Disadvantage examples of this architecture are 
single point failure, bottle neck, architecture and traffic scalability, and 
potential hot-potato routing scenarios. Some claim that this architecture has a 
potential of N squared connectivity issue.



5.2 Semi-Composed S/BC 

       The semi-composed S/BC splits signaling and control functions (SF) from 
the media and routing functions (MF and RF). An SF can be an S/BC which has only 
the signal and control functions. MF and RF functions are integrated with an 
edge-router or a Media Relay (MR). Operation and management functions (OF) may 
be required in both components. ENUM function may be a separate entity. The 
following figure shows the semi-composed configuration and its associated 
network architecture:

              Figure 5: Decomposed S/BC configuration


This one-to-one solution (SF and edge-router (MF + RF)) provides engineering 
flexibility for individual border points (variable relationship between SF 
computing capacity and MF bearer capacity) and deployment flexibility through 
the opportunity to place functions at different network locations (MF in an edge 
router, SF in a data center). However, it requires two devices per interface 
(border point) and introduces the requirement of additional external control 
links. On the other hand, in a composed S/BC the MF:SF is internal, protected, 
low latency interface. The Decomposed S/BC solution retains the stand-alone S/BC 
disadvantages of single point of failure, architectural scalability, and 
potential hot-potato routing behavior.

5.3 Centralized S/BC with MGCF

      This configuration integrates SF functions with the Media 
Gateway Controller Function (MGCF) in a Soft-switch architecture.  
Edge-routers integrate MF and RF functions. Operation and management functions 
(OF) may be required in both components. ENUM function may be a separate entity. 
The following figure shows the centralized S/BC with MGCF configuration and its 
associated network architecture.

              Figure 6: Centralized S/BC functions deployment with MGCF 


This one-to-many (SF and MF+ RF) implementation of S/BC functions in a soft-
switch architecture provides architectural and traffic scalability advantages 
because one SF is associated with multiple media-relays or edge-routers(MF+ RF), 
resulting in fewer signaling elements with broader control of media (MF) 
resources. The association of SF and MGCF functionalities seems to provide a 
rational functional alignment as they both control media functions. This 
architecture may introduce additional complexity that must be addressed by the 
SF to distinguish between access networks and to perform the appropriate NAT 
functions on signaling and bearer data for each access network. Analysis for 
signaling attacks needs to be performed properly in the SF. Intelligent 
network-layer queuing, rate-limiting, and policy functions that support 
wire-speed IP forwarding engine need to be implemented in the MF. Robust 
coupling between SF and MF needs to be performed to implement appropriate 
security. For that appropriate control protocols or SIP extension needs to be 
developed.

5.4 Centralized S/BC with CSCF 

This configuration integrates SF functions with the Call/Session Control 
Functions (CSCFs) or Breakout Gateway Control Function (BGCF) in a IMS 
architecture.  Edge-routers integrate BF and RF functions. Operation and 
management functions (OF) may be required in both components. ENUM function may 
be a separate entity. The following figure shows the centralized S/BC with the 
CSCF configuration and its associated network architecture.

       This one-to-many (SF and BF+ RF) implementation in IMS architecture 
provides architectural and traffic scalability advantages because one SF is 
associated with multiple (BF+RF)s, resulting in fewer call control elements with 
broader control of media (BF) resources. The association of SF and CSCF 
functionalities (specifically between the SF and I/P-CSCF functionalities) 
appears to be a rational alignment of border signaling functions. Integration of 
SF and I/P-CSCF or BGCF functionalities might also reduce network complexity 
through a reduction in call control elements. This architecture may introduce 
additional complexity that must be addressed by the SF to distinguish between 
access networks and to perform the appropriate NAT functions on signaling and 
bearer data for each access network. Analysis for signaling attacks needs to be 
performed properly in the SF. Intelligent network-layer queuing, rate-limiting, 
and policy functions that support wire-speed IP forwarding engine need to be 
implemented in the MF. Robust coupling between SF and MF needs to be performed 
to implement appropriate security. For that appropriate control protocols or SIP 
extension needs to be developed.


5.5 Distributed S/BC

       In this configuration, SF, MF, and RF functions are distributed across 
the network devices. For example, an (MGCF+CSCF) device integrates some SF 
functions, an edge-router integrates some MF functions, and a fire-wall (FW) 
device integrates some SF and MF functions. The following figure illustrates the 
distributed S/BC configuration and its associated network architecture.

This architecture may introduce additional complexity that must be addressed 
by the SF to distinguish between access networks and to perform the  appropriate 
NAT functions on signaling and bearer data for each access network. 
This architecture has scalability and operational advantages similar to the 
preceding case, with the possible addition of better alignment between border 
control and existing IMS functional decomposition. For that appropriate control 
protocols or SIP extension needs to be developed as protocols between firewall 
and other devices.


6.  Security Considerations

   Many of the functions this document describes have important security
   and privacy implications.  If the IETF decides to develop standard
   mechanisms to address those functions, security and privacy-related
   aspects will need to be taken into consideration.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
