  Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Telemetry
                     draft-reddy-dots-telemetry-03

Abstract

   This document aims to enrich DOTS signal channel protocol with
   various telemetry attributes allowing optimal DDoS attack mitigation.
   This document specifies the normal traffic baseline and attack
   traffic telemetry attributes a DOTS client can convey to its DOTS
   server in the mitigation request, the mitigation status telemetry
   attributes a DOTS server can communicate to a DOTS client, and the
   mitigation efficacy telemetry attributes a DOTS client can
   communicate to a DOTS server.  The telemetry attributes can assist
   the mitigator to choose the DDoS mitigation techniques and perform
   optimal DDoS attack mitigation.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet security 'battle' between the adversary and security
   countermeasures is an everlasting one.  DDoS attacks have become more
   vicious and sophisticated in almost all aspects of their maneuvers
   and malevolent intentions.  IT organizations and service providers
   are facing DDoS attacks that fall into two broad categories: Network/
   Transport layer attacks and Application layer attacks.  Network/
   Transport layer attacks target the victim's infrastructure.  These
   attacks are not necessarily aimed at taking down the actual delivered
   services, but rather to eliminate various network elements (routers,
   switches, firewalls, transit links, and so on) from serving
   legitimate user traffic.  The main method of such attacks is to send
   a large volume or high PPS of traffic toward the victim's
   infrastructure.  Typically, attack volumes may vary from a few 100
   Mbps/PPS to 100s of Gbps or even Tbps.  Attacks are commonly carried
   out leveraging botnets and attack reflectors for amplification
   attacks, such as NTP, DNS, SNMP, SSDP, and so on.  Application layer
   attacks target various applications.  Typical examples include
   attacks against HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SIP, SMTP, and so on.  However, all
   valid applications with their port numbers open at network edges can
   be attractive attack targets.  Application layer attacks are
   considered more complex and hard to categorize, therefore harder to
   detect and mitigate efficiently.

   To compound the problem, attackers also leverage multi-vectored
   attacks.  These merciless attacks are assembled from dynamic attack
   vectors (Network/Application) and tactics.  As such, multiple attack
   vectors formed by multiple attack types and volumes are launched
   simultaneously towards a victim.  Multi-vector attacks are harder to
   detect and defend.  Multiple and simultaneous mitigation techniques
   are needed to defeat such attack campaigns.  It is also common for
   attackers to change attack vectors right after a successful
   mitigation, burdening their opponents with changing their defense
   methods.

   The ultimate conclusion derived from these real scenarios is that
   modern attacks detection and mitigation are most certainly
   complicated and highly convoluted tasks.  They demand a comprehensive
   knowledge of the attack attributes, the targeted normal behavior/
   traffic patterns, as well as the attacker's on-going and past
   actions.  Even more challenging, retrieving all the analytics needed

   for detecting these attacks is not simple to obtain with the
   industry's current capabilities.

   The DOTS signal channel protocol [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] is
   used to carry information about a network resource or a network (or a
   part thereof) that is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
   attack.  Such information is sent by a DOTS client to one or multiple
   DOTS servers so that appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken on
   traffic deemed suspicious.  Various use cases are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases].

   Typically, DOTS clients can be integrated within a DDoS attack
   detector, or network and security elements that have been actively
   engaged with ongoing attacks.  The DOTS client mitigation environment
   determines that it is no longer possible or practical for it to
   handle these attacks.  This can be due to lack of resources or
   security capabilities, as derived from the complexities and the
   intensity of these attacks.  In this circumstance, the DOTS client
   has invaluable knowledge about the actual attacks that need to be
   handled by the DOTS server.  By enabling the DOTS client to share
   this comprehensive knowledge of an ongoing attack under specific
   circumstances, the DOTS server can drastically increase its abilities
   to accomplish successful mitigation.  While the attack is being
   handled by the DOTS server associated mitigation resources, the DOTS
   server has the knowledge about the ongoing attack mitigation.  The
   DOTS server can share this information with the DOTS client so that
   the client can better assess and evaluate the actual mitigation
   realized.

   In some deployments, DOTS clients can send mitigation hints derived
   from attack details to DOTS servers, with the full understanding that
   the DOTS server may ignore mitigation hints, as described in
   [RFC8612] (Gen-004).  Mitigation hints will be transmitted across the
   DOTS signal channel, as the data channel may not be functional during
   an attack.  How a DOTS server is handling normal and attack traffic
   attributes, and mitigation hints is implementation-specific.

   Both DOTS client and server can benefit this information by
   presenting various information in relevant management, reporting, and
   portal systems.

   This document defines DOTS telemetry attributes the DOTS client can
   convey to the DOTS server, and vice versa.  The DOTS telemetry
   attributes are not mandatory fields.  Nevertheless, when DOTS
   telemetry attributes are available to a DOTS agent, and absent any
   policy, it can signal the attributes in order to optimize the overall
   mitigation service provisioned using DOTS.  Some of the DOTS
   telemetry data are not shared during an attack time.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in [RFC8612].

   "DOTS Telemetry" is defined as the collection of attributes that are
   used to characterize normal traffic baseline, attacks and their
   mitigation measures, and any related information that may help in
   enforcing countermeasures.  The DOTS Telemetry is an optional set of
   attributes that can be signaled in the DOTS signal channel protocol.

   The meaning of the symbols in YANG tree diagrams is defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  DOTS Telemetry: Overview & Purpose

   When signaling a mitigation request, it is most certainly beneficial
   for the DOTS client to signal to the DOTS server any knowledge
   regarding ongoing attacks.  This can happen in cases where DOTS
   clients are asking the DOTS server for support in defending against
   attacks that they have already detected and/or mitigated.  These
   actions taken by DOTS clients are referred to as "signaling the DOTS
   Telemetry".

   If attacks are already detected and categorized by the DOTS client
   domain, the DOTS server, and its associated mitigation services, can
   proactively benefit this information and optimize the overall service
   delivered.  It is important to note that DOTS client and server
   detection and mitigation approaches can be different, and can
   potentially outcome different results and attack classifications.
   The DDoS mitigation service treats the ongoing attack details from
   the client as hints and cannot completely rely or trust the attack
   details conveyed by the DOTS client.

   A basic requirement of security operation teams is to be aware and
   get visibility into the attacks they need to handle.  The DOTS server
   security operation teams benefit from the DOTS telemetry, especially
   from the reports of ongoing attacks.  Even if some mitigation can be
   automated, operational teams can use the DOTS telemetry to be
   prepared for attack mitigation and to assign the correct resources
   (operation staff, networking and mitigation) for the specific
   service.  Similarly, security operation personnel at the DOTS client
   side ask for feedback about their requests for protection.



Reddy, et al.             Expires April 6, 2020                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               DOTS Telemetry                 October 2019


   Therefore, it is valuable for the DOTS server to share DOTS telemetry
   with the DOTS client.  Thus mutual sharing of information is crucial
   for "closing the mitigation loop" between the DOTS client and server.
   For the server side team, it is important to realize that the same
   attacks that the DOTS server's mitigation resources are seeing are
   those that the DOTS client is asking to mitigate.  For the DOTS
   client side team, it is important to realize that the DOTS clients
   receive the required service.  For example: understanding that "I
   asked for mitigation of two attacks and my DOTS server detects and
   mitigates only one...".  Cases of inconsistency in attack
   classification between DOTS client and server can be high-lighted,
   and maybe handled, using the DOTS telemetry attributes.

   In addition, management and orchestration systems, at both DOTS
   client and server sides, can potentially use DOTS telemetry as a
   feedback to automate various control and management activities
   derived from ongoing information signaled.

   If the DOTS server's mitigation resources have the capabilities to
   facilitate the DOTS telemetry, the DOTS server adopts its protection
   strategy and activates the required countermeasures immediately
   (automation enabled).  The overall results of this adoption are
   optimized attack mitigation decisions and actions.

   The DOTS telemetry can also be used to tune the DDoS mitigators with
   the correct state of the attack.  During the last few years, DDoS
   attack detection technologies have evolved from threshold-based
   detection (that is, cases when all or specific parts of traffic cross
   a pre-defined threshold for a certain period of time is considered as
   an attack) to an "anomaly detection" approach.  In anomaly detection,
   the main idea is to maintain rigorous learning of "normal" behavior
   and where an "anomaly" (or an attack) is identified and categorized
   based on the knowledge about the normal behavior and a deviation from
   this normal behavior.  Machine learning approaches are used such that
   the actual "traffic thresholds" are "automatically calculated" by
   learning the protected entity normal traffic behavior during peace
   time.  The normal traffic characterization learned is referred to as
   the "normal traffic baseline".  An attack is detected when the
   victim's actual traffic is deviating from this normal baseline.

   In addition, subsequent activities toward mitigating an attack are
   much more challenging.  The ability to distinguish legitimate traffic
   from attacker traffic on a per packet basis is complex.  This
   complexity originates from the fact that the packet itself may look
   "legitimate" and no attack signature can be identified.  The anomaly
   can be identified only after detailed statistical analysis.  DDoS
   attack mitigators use the normal baseline during the mitigation of an
   attack to identify and categorize the expected appearance of a



Reddy, et al.             Expires April 6, 2020                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               DOTS Telemetry                 October 2019


   specific traffic pattern.  Particularly the mitigators use the normal
   baseline to recognize the "level of normality" needs to be achieved
   during the various mitigation process.

   Normal baseline calculation is performed based on continuous learning
   of the normal behavior of the protected entities.  The minimum
   learning period varies from hours to days and even weeks, depending
   on the protected application behavior.  The baseline cannot be
   learned during active attacks because attack conditions do not
   characterize the protected entities' normal behavior.

   If the DOTS client has calculated the normal baseline of its
   protected entities, signaling this attribute to the DOTS server along
   with the attack traffic levels is significantly valuable.  The DOTS
   server benefits from this telemetry by tuning its mitigation
   resources with the DOTS client's normal baseline.  The DOTS server
   mitigators use the baseline to familiarize themselves with the attack
   victim's normal behavior and target the baseline as the level of
   normality they need to achieve.  Consequently, the overall mitigation
   performances obtained are dramatically improved in terms of time to
   mitigate, accuracy, false-negative, false-positive, and other
   measures.

   Mitigation of attacks without having certain knowledge of normal
   traffic can be inaccurate at best.  This is especially true for
   recursive signaling (see Section 3.2.3 in [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases]).
   In addition, the highly diverse types of use-cases where DOTS clients
   are integrated also emphasize the need for knowledge of client
   behavior.  Consequently, common global thresholds for attack
   detection practically cannot be realized.  Each DOTS client can have
   its own levels of traffic and normal behavior.  Without facilitating
   normal baseline signaling, it may be very difficult for DOTS servers
   in some cases to detect and mitigate the attacks accurately.  It is
   important to emphasize that it is practically impossible for the
   server's mitigators to calculate the normal baseline, in cases they
   do not have any knowledge of the traffic beforehand.  In addition,
   baseline learning requires a period of time that cannot be afforded
   during active attack.  Of course, this information can provided using
   out-of-band mechanisms or manual configuration at the risk to
   maintain inaccurate information as the network evolves and "normal"
   patterns change.  The use of a dynamic and collaborative means
   between the DOTS client and server to identify and share key
   parameters for the sake of efficient DDoS protect is valuable.

   During a high volume attack, DOTS client pipes can be totally
   saturated.  The DOTS client asks the DOTS server to handle the attack
   upstream so that DOTS client pipes return to a reasonable load level
   (normal pattern, ideally).  At this point, it is essential to ensure



Reddy, et al.             Expires April 6, 2020                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               DOTS Telemetry                 October 2019


   that the mitigator does not overwhelm the DOTS client pipes by
   sending back "clean traffic", or what it believes is "clean".  This
   can happen when the mitigator has not managed to detect and mitigate
   all the attacks launched towards the client.  In this case, it can be
   valuable to clients to signal to server the "Total pipe capacity",
   which is the level of traffic the DOTS client domain can absorb from
   the upstream network.  Dynamic updating of the condition of pipes
   between DOTS agents while they are under a DDoS attack is essential.
   For example, for cases of multiple DOTS clients share the same
   physical connectivity pipes.  It is important to note, that the term
   "pipe" noted here does not necessary represent physical pipe, but
   rather represents the current level of traffic client can observe
   from server.  The server should activate other mechanisms to ensure
   it does not saturate the client's pipes unintentionally.  The rate-
   limit action defined in [I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel] can be a
   reasonable candidate to achieve this objective; the client can ask
   for the type of traffic (such as ICMP, UDP, TCP port 80) it prefers
   to limit.

   To summarize, timely and effective signaling of up-to-date DOTS
   telemetry to all elements involved in the mitigation process is
   essential and absolutely improves the overall service effectiveness.
   Bi-directional feedback between DOTS agents is required for the
   increased awareness of each party, supporting superior and highly
   efficient attack mitigation service.

4.  DOTS Telemetry Attributes

   There are two broad types of DDoS attacks, one is bandwidth consuming
   attack, the other is target resource consuming attack.  This section
   outlines the set of DOTS telemetry attributes that covers both the
   types of attacks.  The ultimate objective of these attributes is to
   allow for the complete knowledge of attacks and the various
   particulars that can best characterize attacks.

   The description and motivation behind each attribute were presented
   in Section 3.  DOTS telemetry attributes are optionally signaled and
   therefore MUST NOT be treated as mandatory fields in the DOTS signal
   channel protocol.

4.1.  Pre-mitigation DOTS Telemetry Attributes

   The pre-mitigation telemetry attributes are indicated by the path-
   suffix '/telemetry'.  The '/telemetry' is appended to the path-prefix
   to form the URI used with a CoAP request to signal the DOTS
   telemetry.  The following pre-mitigation telemetry attributes can be
   signaled from the DOTS client to the DOTS server.

   o  DISCUSSION NOTES: (1) Some telemetry can be communicated using
      DOTS data channel. (2) Evaluate the risk of fragmentation,. Some
      of the information is not specific to each mitigation request. (3)
      Should we define other configuration parameters to be controlled a
      DOTS client, e.g., Indicate a favorite measurement unit?  Indicate
      a minimum notification interval?

4.1.1.  Total Traffic Normal Baseline

   The low percentile (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th
   percentile), high percentile (90th percentile) and peak values (100th
   percentile) of "Total traffic normal baselines" measured in packets
   per second (PPS) or kilo packets per second (Kpps) and Bits per
   Second (BPS), and kilobytes per second or megabytes per second or
   gigabytes per second.  For example, 90th percentile says that 90% of
   the time, the total normal traffic is below the limit specified.  The
   traffic normal baseline is represented for a target and is transport-
   protocol specific.

4.1.2.  Total Pipe Capability

   The limit of traffic volume, in packets per second (PPS) or kilo
   packets per second (Kpps) and Bits per Second (BPS), and in kilobytes
   per second or megabytes per second or gigabytes per second.  These
   attributes represents the DOTS client domain pipe limit.

   o  NOTE: Multi-homing case to be considered.

4.1.3.  Total Attack Traffic

   The total attack traffic can be identified by the DOTS client
   domain's DDoS Mitigation System (DMS) or DDoS Detector.  The low
   percentile (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th percentile), high
   percentile (90th percentile) and peak values of total attack traffic
   measured in packets per second (PPS) or kilo packets per second
   (Kpps) and Bits per Second (BPS), and kilobytes per second or
   megabytes per second or gigabytes per second.  The total attack
   traffic is represented for a target and is transport-protocol
   specific.

4.1.4.  Total Traffic

   The low percentile (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th
   percentile), high percentile (90th percentile) and peak values of
   total traffic during a DDoS attack measured in packets per second
   (PPS) or kilo packets per second (Kpps) and Bits per Second (BPS),
   and kilobytes per second or megabytes per second gigabytes per

   second.  The total traffic is represented for a target and is
   transport-protocol specific.

4.1.5.  Total Connections Capacity

   If the target is subjected to resource consuming DDoS attack, the
   following optional attributes for the target per transport-protocol
   are useful to detect resource consuming DDoS attacks:

   o  The maximum number of simultaneous connections that are allowed to
      the target server.  The threshold is transport-protocol specific
      because the target server could support multiple protocols.

   o  The maximum number of simultaneous connections that are allowed to
      the target server per client.

   o  The maximum number of simultaneous embryonic connections that are
      allowed to the target server.  The term "embryonic connection"
      refers to a connection whose connection handshake is not finished
      and embryonic connection is only possible in connection-oriented
      transport protocols like TCP or SCTP.

   o  The maximum number of simultaneous embryonic connections that are
      allowed to the target server per client.

   o  The maximum number of connections allowed per second to the target
      server.

   o  The maximum number of connections allowed per second to the target
      server per client.

   o  The maximum number of requests allowed per second to the target
      server.

   o  The maximum number of requests allowed per second to the target
      server per client.

   o  The maximum number of partial requests allowed per second to the
      target server.

   o  The maximum number of partial requests allowed per second to the

4.1.6.  Total Attack Connections

   If the target is subjected to resource consuming DDoS attack, the low
   percentile (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th percentile), high
   percentile (90th percentile) and peak values of following optional

   attributes for the target per transport-protocol are included to
   represent the attack characteristics:

   o  The number of simultaneous attack connections to the target
      server.

   o  The number of simultaneous embryonic connections to the target
      server.

   o  The number of attack connections per second to the target server.

   o  The number of attack requests to the target server.

4.1.7.  Attack Details

   Various information and details that describe the on-going attacks
   that needs to be mitigated by the DOTS server.  The attack details
   need to cover well-known and common attacks (such as a SYN Flood)
   along with new emerging or vendor-specific attacks.  The attack
   details can also be signaled from the DOTS server to the DOTS client.
   For example, the DOTS server co-located with a DDoS detector collects
   monitoring information from the target network, identifies DDoS
   attack using statistical analysis or deep learning techniques, and
   signals the attack details to the DOTS client.  The client can use
   the attack details to decide whether to trigger the mitigation
   request or not.  Further, the security operation personnel at the
   DOTS client domain can use the attack details to determine the
   protection strategy and select the appropriate DOTS server for
   mitigating the attack.  The DOTS client can receive asynchronous
   notifications of the attack details from the DOTS server using the
   Observe option defined in [RFC7641].

   The following new fields describing the on-going attack are
   discussed:

   vendor-id:  Vendor ID is a security vendor's Enterprise Number as
      registered with IANA [Enterprise-Numbers].  It is a four-byte
      integer value.

      This is a mandatory sub-attribute.

   attack-id:  Unique identifier assigned by the vendor for the attack.

      This is a mandatory sub-attribute.

   attack-name:  Textual representation of attack description.  Natural
      Language Processing techniques (e.g., word embedding) can possibly
      be used to map the attack description to an attack type.  Textual

      representation of attack solves two problems (a) avoids the need
      to create mapping tables manually between vendors (2) Avoids the
      need to standardize attack types which keep evolving.

      This is a mandatory sub-attribute

   attack-severity:  Attack severity.  Emergency (0), critical (1) and
      alert (2).

      This is an optional sub-attribute

   start-time:  The time the attack started.  The attack start time is
      expressed in seconds relative to 1970-01-01T00:00Z in UTC time
      (Section 2.4.1 of [RFC7049]).  The CBOR encoding is modified so
      that the leading tag 1 (epoch-based date/time) MUST be omitted.

      This is a mandatory sub-attribute

   end-time:           The time the attack-id attack ended.  The attack
      end time is expressed in seconds relative to 1970-01-01T00:00Z in
      UTC time (Section 2.4.1 of [RFC7049]).  The CBOR encoding is
      modified so that the leading tag 1 (epoch-based date/time) MUST be
      omitted.

      This is an optional sub-attribute

   The following existing fields are re-defined describing the on-going
   attack are discussed:

   o  The target resource is identified using the attributes 'target-
      prefix', 'target-port-range', 'target-protocol', 'target-
      fqdn','target-uri', or 'alias-name' defined in the base DOTS
      signal channel protocol and at least one of the attributes
      'target-prefix', 'target-fqdn','target-uri', or 'alias-name' MUST
      be present in the attack details.

      A.  If the target is subjected to bandwidth consuming attack, the
          attributes representing the low percentile (10th percentile),
          mid percentile (50th percentile), high percentile (90th
          percentile) and peak values of the attack-id attack traffic
          measured in packets per second (PPS) or kilo packets per
          second (Kpps) and Bits per Second (BPS), and kilobytes per
          second or megabytes per second or gigabytes per second are
          included.

      B.  If the target is subjected to resource consuming DDoS attacks,
          the same attributes defined for Section 4.1.6 are applicable
          for representing the attack.

      This is an optional sub-attribute.

   o  List of top talkers targeting the victim.  The top talkers are
      represented using the 'source-prefix' defined in
      [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-call-home].  If the top talkers are spoofed
      IP addresses (e.g., reflection attacks) or not.  If the target is
      subjected to bandwidth consuming attack, the attack traffic from
      each of the top talkers represented in the low percentile (10th
      percentile), mid percentile (50th percentile), high percentile
      (90th percentile) and peak values of traffic measured in packets
      per second (PPS) or kilo packets per second (Kpps) and Bits per
      Second (BPS), and kilobytes per second or megabytes per second
      gigabytes per second.  If the target is subjected to resource
      consuming DDoS attacks, the same attributes defined for
      Section 4.1.6 are applicable here for representing the attack per
      talker.  This is an optional sub-attribute.

4.2.  DOTS Client to Server Mitigation Efficacy DOTS Telemetry
      Attributes

   The mitigation efficacy telemetry attributes can be signaled from the
   DOTS client to the DOTS server as part of the periodic mitigation
   efficacy updates to the server.

4.2.1.  Total Attack Traffic

   The low percentile (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th
   percentile), high percentile (90th percentile), and peak values of
   total attack traffic the DOTS client still sees during the active
   mitigation service measured in packets per second (PPS) or kilo
   packets per second (Kpps) and Bits per Second (BPS), and kilobytes
   per second or megabytes per second or gigabytes per second.

4.2.2.  Attack Details

   The overall attack details as observed from the DOTS client
   perspective during the active mitigation service.  The same
   attributes defined in Section 4.1.7 are applicable here.

4.3.  DOTS Server to Client Mitigation Status DOTS Telemetry Attributes

   The mitigation status telemetry attributes can be signaled from the
   DOTS server to the DOTS client as part of the periodic mitigation
   status update.

4.3.1.  Mitigation Status

   As defined in [RFC8612], the actual mitigation activities can include
   several countermeasure mechanisms.  The DOTS server SHOULD signal the
   current operational status to each relevant countermeasure.  A list
   of attacks detected by each countermeasure.  The same attributes
   defined for Section 4.1.7 are applicable here for describing the
   attacks detected and mitigated.

5.  DOTS Telemetry Configuration

5.1.  Convey DOTS Telemetry Configuration

   PUT request is used to convey the configuration parameters for the
   telemetry data (e.g., low, mid, or high percentile values).  For
   example, a DOTS client may contact its DOTS server to change the
   default percentiles values used as baseline for telemetry data.  In
   reference to the example shown in Figure 1, the DOTS client modifies
   all percentile reference values.

     Header: PUT (Code=0.03)
     Uri-Path: ".well-known"
     Uri-Path: "dots"
     Uri-Path: "telemetry"
     Uri-Path: "tcid=123"
     Content-Format: "application/dots+cbor"

     {
       "ietf-dots-telemetry:telemetry-config": {
         "low-percentile": 5.00,
         "mid-percentile": 65.00,
         "high-percentile": 95.00
       }
     }

         Figure 1: PUT to Convey the DOTS Telemetry Configuration

   The following additional Uri-Path parameter is defined:

   tcid:  Telemetry Configuration Identifier is an identifier for the
        DOTS telemetry configuration data represented as an integer.
        This identifier MUST be generated by DOTS clients.  'tcid'
        values MUST increase monotonically (when a new PUT is generated
        by a DOTS client to convey the configuration parameters for the
        telemetry).

        This is a mandatory attribute.

Internet-Draft               DOTS Telemetry                 October 2019


   At least one configurable attribute MUST be present in the PUT
   request.

   The PUT request with a higher numeric 'tcid' value overrides the DOTS
   telemetry configuration data installed by a PUT request with a lower
   numeric 'tcid' value.  To avoid maintaining a long list of 'tcid'
   requests from a DOTS client, the lower numeric 'tcid' MUST be
   automatically deleted and no longer available at the DOTS server.

   The DOTS server indicates the result of processing the PUT request
   using CoAP response codes:

   o  If the request is missing a mandatory attribute, does not include
      a 'tcid' Uri-Path, or contains one or more invalid or unknown
      parameters, 4.00 (Bad Request) MUST be returned in the response.

   o  If the DOTS server does not find the 'tcid' parameter value
      conveyed in the PUT request in its configuration data and if the
      DOTS server has accepted the configuration parameters, then a
      response code 2.01 (Created) MUST be returned in the response.

   o  If the DOTS server finds the 'tcid' parameter value conveyed in
      the PUT request in its configuration data and if the DOTS server
      has accepted the updated configuration parameters, 2.04 (Changed)
      MUST be returned in the response.

   o  If any of the enclosed configurable attribute values are not
      acceptable to the DOTS server, 4.22 (Unprocessable Entity) MUST be
      returned in the response.

      The DOTS client may re-try and send the PUT request with updated
      attribute values acceptable to the DOTS server.

   A DOTS client may issue a GET message with 'tcid' Uri-Path parameter
   to retrieve the negotiated configuration.  The response does not need
   to include 'tcid' in its message body.

5.2.  Delete DOTS Telemetry Configuration

   A DELETE request is used to delete the installed DOTS telemetry
   configuration data (Figure 2).

Internet-Draft               DOTS Telemetry                 October 2019


     Header: DELETE (Code=0.04)
     Uri-Path: ".well-known"
     Uri-Path: "dots"
     Uri-Path: "telemetry"
     Uri-Path: "tcid=123"

                 Figure 2: Delete Telemetry Configuration

   The DOTS server resets the DOTS telemetry configuration back to the
   default values and acknowledges a DOTS client's request to remove the
   DOTS telemetry configuration using 2.02 (Deleted) response code.

   Upon bootstrapping or reboot, a DOTS client MAY send a DELETE request
   to set the telemetry parameters to default values.  Such a request
   does not include any 'tcid'.

6.  DOTS Telemetry YANG Module

6.1.  Tree Structure

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-dots-telemetry", which
   has the following tree structure.  It augments the "ietf-dots-signal"
   with a new message type called "telemetry" and the "mitigation-scope"
   type message with telemetry data.

      Notes: (1) Check naming conflict to ease CBOR mapping (e.g, low-
      percentile is defined as yang:gauge64, list, or container).
      Distinct names may be considered. (2) "protocol" is not indicated
      in the telemetry data of "mitigation-scope" message type because
      the mitigation request may include a "protocol".  Similarly,
      "target-*" is not included in the in the telemetry data of
      "mitigation-scope" message type because the mitigation request
      must include at least one of the "target-*" attribute.
