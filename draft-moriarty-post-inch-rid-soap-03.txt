Abstract

    Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must
    share a common format and transport mechanism.  The Incident Object
    Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for
    document exchange.  This draft outlines the SOAP wrapper for all
    IODEF documents and extensions to facilitate an interoperable and
    secure communication of documents.  The SOAP wrapper allows for
    flexibility in the selection of a transport protocol.  The
    transport protocols will be provided through existing standards and
    SOAP binding, such as SOAP over HTTP/TLS and SOAP over BEEP.

1. Terminology
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1.1 Introduction

    The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) [RFCXXXX]
    describes an XML document format for the purpose of exchanging data
    between CSIRTS or those responsible for security incident handling
    for network providers (NPs).  The defined document format provides
    an easy way for CSIRTS to exchange data in a way which can be easily
    parsed.  In order for the IODEF documents to be shared between
    entities, a uniform method for transport is necessary. SOAP [2] will
    provide a layer of abstraction and enable the use of multiple
    transport protocol bindings.  IODEF documents and extensions will
    be contained in an XML Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID)
    [RFCYYYY] envelope inside the body of a SOAP message.  For some
    message types, the IODEF document or RID document may stand alone
    in the body of a SOAP message.  The RIDPolicy class of RID (e.g.,
    policy information that may affect message routing) will appear in
    the SOAP message header. 

    HTTP/TLS [RFC4346] has been selected as the REQUIRED SOAP binding
    for exchanging IODEF/RID messages.  The primary reason for
    selecting HTTP/TLS is due to the existence of multiple successful
    implementations of SOAP over HTTP/TLS, and to its being widely
    understood, despite the additional overhead associated with this
    combination.  Excellent tool support exists to ease the development
    of applications using SOAP over HTTP.  BEEP may actually be better
    suited as a transport for RID messages containing IODEF documents,
    but does not yet have wide adoption.  Standards exist for the HTTPS
    or HTTP/TLS binding for SOAP.  A standard is in development for
    SOAP over BEEP, [RFC4227].  Standards MUST be followed when
    implementing transport bindings for RID communications.

2. SOAP Wrapper

    IODEF/RID documents, including all supported extensions, intended
    to be shared between CSIRTS or NPs MUST use a SOAP wrapper, along
    with a supported transport protocol binding, for transport.  The
    transport is independent of the wrapper.  SOAP will be used to
    provide the messaging framework and can make distinctions as to how
    messages should be handled by each participating system.  SOAP has
    been selected because of the flexibility it provides for binding
    with transport protocols, which can be independent of the IODEF/RID
    messaging system.

    As defined by the SOAP messaging specifications [3], the
    appropriate message contents for the RID message type, as defined
    in RID, will be in the SOAP body of the message.  The SOAP header


Moriarty & Trammell      Expires: August 14, 2008                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft                                         February 14, 2008


    contains information pertinent to all participating systems that
    receive the message, including the ultimate destination, any
    intermediate hosts, and message processing policy information and
    is provided through RIDPolicy in the RID schema.  Depending on the
    message or document being transported, there may be a case, such as
    with RID messages, in which a host may only need to view the SOAP
    header and not the SOAP body and is, therefore, acting as a SOAP
    intermediary node.  An example of this would be if one RID system
    was sending a communication to a RID system for which there was no
    direct trust relationship, an intermediate RID system may be used
    to provide the trusted path between the communicating systems.
    This intermediate system may not need to see the contents of the
    SOAP body.  Therefore, the elements or classes needed by all
    participating systems MUST be in the SOAP header, specifically the
    RIDPolicy class.  Each participating system receiving an incident
    handling IODEF/RID document is an ultimate destination and has to
    parse and view the entire IODEF/RID document to make necessary
    decisions.

    The SOAP specifications for intermediate and ultimate nodes MUST be
    Followed; for example, a message destined for an intermediate node
    would contain the attribute env:role with the value
    http://www.w3c.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/next.  Also in
    accordance with the SOAP specifications, the attribute of
    env:mustUnderstand has a value of "true" to ensure each node
    processes the header blocks consistent with the specifications for
    IODEF/RID.

    SOAP messages are typically a one-way conversation. Transmittal of
    incident information to another RID host in the form of a Report
    message is the single case within RID where a one way communication
    is specified.  The arrival of an IODEF Report document in a RID
    message is simply an assertion that a described incident occurred.
    In the case of other RID message types, two or more SOAP messages
    may be exchanged to enable bi-directional communication. 
    Request/response pairs defined by RID include:
        TraceRequest/TraceAuthorization/Result,
        Investigation/Result, and 
        IncidentQuery/Report.

3. Transport Protocol Bindings

    The SOAP binding will be used for message transport.  One agreed-
    upon protocol, HTTP/TLS, MUST be implemented by all RID systems and
    other protocols are optional.  The use of a single transport
    binding supported by all systems sending and receiving RID messages
    and will enable interoperability between participating CSIRTS and
    NPs.  Other protocol bindings may be defined in separate documents.

3.1 SOAP over HTTP/TLS

    SOAP over HTTP/TLS is widely supported, as are ancillary tools such


Moriarty & Trammell      Expires: August 14, 2008                 [Page 4]
Internet-Draft                                         February 14, 2008


    as the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), hence the
    selection of SOAP over HTTP/1.1 over TLS as Mandatory for transport
    of RID communications.  Security is provided through the RID
    specification and all REQUIRED RID security MUST be implemented.
    TLS offers additional security at the transport layer to ensure the
    integrity of the session.

    BCP 56 [RFC3205] contains a number of important considerations when
    using HTTP for application protocols.  These include the size of
    the payload for the application, whether the application will use a
    web browser, whether the protocol should be defined on a port other
    than 80, and if the security provided through HTTP/TLS suits the
    needs of the new application. 

    It is acknowledged within the scope of these concerns that HTTP/TLS
    is not ideally suited for IODEF/RID transport, as the former is a
    client-server protocol and the latter a message-exchange protocol;
    however, the ease of implementation for services based on SOAP over
    HTTP outweighs these concerns. Consistent with BCP 56, IODEF/RID
    over SOAP over HTTP/TLS will require its own TCP port assignment
    from IANA.

    Every RID system participating in a consortium MUST listen for
    HTTP/TLS connections on the assigned port, as the requests and
    responses in a RID message exchange transaction may be
    significantly separated in time. If a RID message is answered
    immediately, or within a generally accepted HTTP client timeout
    (about thirty seconds), the listening system SHOULD return the
    reply message in the HTTP response body; otherwise, it must
    initiate a connection to the requesting system and send its reply
    in an HTTP request.

    If the HTTP response body sent in reply to a RID message does not
    contain a RID message itself, the response body SHOULD be empty,
    and RID clients MUST ignore any response body that is not an
    expected RID message. This provision applies ONLY to HTTP response
    bodies; unsolicited HTTP requests (such as Reports not preceded by
    an IncidentQuery) are handled according to the message exchange
    pattern described in RID.

    RID systems SHOULD use HTTP/1.1 persistent connections as described
    in [RFC2616] to minimize TCP connection setup overhead. RID systems
    SHOULD support chunked transfer encoding on the HTTP server side to
    allow the implementation of clients that do not need to
    precalculate message sizes before constructing HTTP headers.

3.2 SOAP over BEEP

    SOAP over BEEP is an optional transport binding for IODEF/RID. A
    RID system supporting BEEP [RFC3080] MAY attempt to use SOAP over
    BEEP on first connection with a peer; if the peer does not support
    SOAP over BEEP, the initiating peer MUST fall back to SOAP over


Moriarty & Trammell      Expires: August 14, 2008                 [Page 5]
Internet-Draft                                         February 14, 2008


    HTTPS, and SHOULD note that the peer does not support BEEP, to
    avoid attempting to use BEEP in future communications.

    BEEP has certain implementation advantages over HTTP/TLS for this
    application; however, the protocol has not been widely implemented.
    Communication between participating RID systems is on a server-to-
    server basis, for which BEEP is better suited than HTTP.   Incident
    handling may at times require immediate action; thus, a protocol
    with low overhead and minimum bandwidth requirements is desirable.

    To provide equivalent transport-layer security to HTTP/TLS, the
    BEEP TLS profile MUST be supported if BEEP is implemented and
    SHOULD be used.

4. Examples

    The examples below, parallel to the examples in section 4.5 of RID,
    demonstrate how the structure of RID messages fit into SOAP
    containers as outlined in this document for each message type. Of
    particular note in each is the use of the RID policy information in
    the SOAP header.  The RID schema was designed to enable the use of
    RIDPolicy to stand alone in the SOAP header and to enable the use of
    the RID class, RequestStatus to stand alone in the SOAP body
    without the need for an IODEF document.  When the RID class called
    IncidentSource is used, it is combined with an associated IODEF
    document in the SOAP body to provide all of the necessary
    information in response to an incident handling request.  The first
    example includes the full IODEF/RID message and associated
    IODEF-Document; following examples omit the IODEF-Document and
    Refer to it in a comment. Where indicated, the IODEF-Document must
    be present, following the requirements listed in the IODEF and RID
    specifications.

    Note: for each example listed below, [RFC3330] addresses were used.
    Assume each IP address listed is actually a separate network range
    held by different NPs.  Addresses were used from /27 network
    ranges.

4.1. Example TraceRequest message

   This TraceRequest is identical to the TraceRequest example in
   Section 4.5.1.1 of RID and would be sent from a CSIRT
   reporting a denial-of-service attack in progress to its upstream
   NP. This request asks the upstream to continue the trace and to
   rate-limit traffic closer to the source.

4.6 Example IncidentQuery

    This IncidentQuery is identical to the IncidentQuery example in
    Section 4.5.4.1 of the RID specification.

5. Security Considerations

    All security considerations of related documents MUST be
    considered, including those in the following documents:
    the Incident Object Description Exchange (IODEF), [RFCXXXX]
    and Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) [RFCYYYY].
    The SOAP wrappers described herein are built upon the 
    foundation of these documents; the security considerations
    contained therein are incorporated by reference.

    Security guidelines such as those described in, "Security
    in a Web Services World: A Proposed Architecture and Roadmap",
    [1] should be considered. 

5.1 Privacy and Confidentiality

    For transport confidentiality, TLS (whether HTTP/TLS or the BEEP
    TLS profile) MUST be supported and SHOULD be used.

    Since multiple bindings for transport may be implemented, RID
    implementations MUST support XML encryption [4] to encrypt the SOAP
    body. Since XML encryption is performed at the IODEF document
    level, not only is the transport encrypted when a document is
    sensitive or contains sensitive elements, but the stored document
    is also encrypted.  Note that this encryption applies only to the
    SOAP body; policy information in the SOAP header should remain

Internet-Draft                                         February 14, 2008


    unencrypted if it is necessary for the intermediate node to
    dispatch the message.   XML encryption protects the IODEF/RID
    document in the SOAP body from being viewed by any involved SOAP
    intermediary node.

5.2 Authentication and Identification

    For transport authentication and identification, TLS (whether
    HTTP/TLS or the BEEP TLS profile) MUST be supported and SHOULD be
    used. Each RID consortium SHOULD use a trusted public key
    infrastructure (PKI) to manage identities for TLS connections.
    The public/private key pairs used for XML encryption and digital
    signatures provide authentication for the RID message.  The session
    encryption keys are also used to identify the communicating hosts
    and provide integrity for the session.

    Since multiple bindings for transport may be implemented, RID
    implementations MUST support XML digital signatures [5] to
    sign the SOAP body; the rationale and implementation here is
    parallel to that for XML encryption discussed in section 5.1.

6. IANA Considerations

    The IANA is requested to assign TCP ports for RID over SOAP over
    HTTPS and for RID over SOAP over BEEP.

7. Summary

    SOAP provides the wrapper to facilitate the exchange of RID
    messages.  The IETF and W3C standards provide detailed
    implementation details for SOAP and SOAP protocol bindings.  The
    use of existing standards assists with development and
    interoperability between RID systems exchanging IODEF documents for
    incident handling purposes.  HTTP/TLS is the mandatory transport
    binding for SOAP to be implemented and BEEP with a TLS profile is
    optional.
