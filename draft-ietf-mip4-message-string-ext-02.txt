Internet-Draft    Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension      January 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new skippable extension that can be added
   by the Foreign Agent and Home Agent in any registration message
   targeted for the Mobile Node.  Such a message may be either a
   Registration Reply or Registration Revocation (i.e. co-located
   Care-of Address mode).  For the Registration Reply message, this
   extension can be added regardless of whether the registration has
   succeeded or failed.

   The content of the text string in this extension and its usage by the
   Mobile Node is implementation specific.  The text string in this
   extension is intended for the user of the Mobile Node.  For example,
   this message can be displayed on the Mobile Node's user interface,
   logged, or handled in any other implementation dependent way,
   depending on the form of the Mobile Node.

   Typical contents of the text string will indicate a registration
   failure reason, or give a welcome message on successful registration.
   This is important as the failure reason code gives very limited
   information for interpretation by the user of the Mobile Node.  For
   example, a string like "registration failed : Prepaid Quota for the
   user is exhausted" can give a human readable description of the
   result of Mobile IP registration.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft    Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension      January 2007


3.  Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension Format

   The Message String Extension conforms to the Short Extension format
   specified for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344].  The Message String Extension is
   a skippable extension.


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     Type      |   Length      |    Sub-Type   |    Text ....
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type:

      To be assigned by IANA.  An 8-bit identifier of the type mobility
      option.

   Length:

      8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the extension, in bytes,
      excluding the extension Type and the extension Length fields.
      This field MUST be set to 1 plus the total length of the Text
      field.

   Sub-Type:

      1:

         Extension comes from the Home Agent

      2:

         Extension comes from the Foreign Agent

   Text:

      The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are
      implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable,
      and MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is RECOMMENDED
      that the message contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC3629] characters.
      The number of octets in the encoded representation of the message
      is always exactly the value of the Length field minus one.  (In
      the UTF-8 case, the number of unicode characters represented by
      this octet sequence may be smaller than the number of octets.)

Internet-Draft    Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension      January 2007


      Other encoding methods than UTF-8 may only be used in closed
      environments where it can be guaranteed that both message sender
      and receiver know the exact encoding method, and know that the
      encoding method is different from UTF-8.

4.  Operation and Use of the Message String Extension

   The Message String Extension is only valid for use within Mobile IPv4
   Registration Reply and Registration Revocation messages.  The Message
   String Extension is a skippable extension.  Either the Home Agent or
   Foreign Agent or both can add the Message String Extension to
   registration messages.  The usage of Text field of the Message String
   Extension is implementation dependent.  For example, the message can
   be displayed on the Mobile Node's user interface, logged, or handled
   in an implementation dependent way, depending on the form of the
   Mobile Node.

   The Mobile Node may throttle how often the user is notified of the
   message (either via display on user interface, logging, etc.)  For
   example, the Home Agent may reject the first Registration Request due
   to prepaid quota for the user is reached and may attach a Message
   String Extension with the text "Prepaid quota reached.  Please
   contact www.paymore.example.com to update balance".  The Mobile Node
   could display this on the user interface.  As a response, the user of
   the Mobile Node may take the required action to update the prepaid
   account and retry the registration process.  The Home Agent may
   accept this Registration Request and attach a Message String
   Extension with the text "Welcome to www.serviceprovider.example.com".
   The Mobile Node could display this on the user interface thus
   confirming successful creation of binding on Home Agent.

5.  Security Considerations

   The Message String Extension can be added by the Home Agent or
   Foreign Agent or both.

   If the extension is added by the Home Agent (extension with subtype
   1) to a Registration Reply or Registration Revocation message, it
   MUST appear before Mobile-Home Authentication Extension [RFC3344].

   If the extension is added by the Foreign Agent (extension with
   subtype 2) to a Registration Reply message, it MUST appear after
   Mobile-Home Authentication Extension [RFC3344] whenever present.
   Also the extension MUST appear before the Mobile-Foreign
   Authentication Extension whenever present.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification reserves one number for the Message String
   Extension in Section 3 from the space of numbers for skippable
   mobility extensions (i.e., 128-255) defined for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344]
   at http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobileip-numbers.

   The value 145 is suggested for this extension.

   This specification also creates a new subtype space for the type
   number of this extension.  The subtype values 1 and 2 are defined in
   this specification.  The subtype value 1 is reserved for use by Home
   Agent and subtype value 2 is reserved for use by Foreign Agent.
   Similar to the procedures specified for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] number
   spaces, future allocations from this number space require expert
   review [RFC2434].
