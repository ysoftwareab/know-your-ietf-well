   Abstract 
    
   The ForCES protocol defines a standard framework and mechanism for 
   the interconnection between Control Elements and Forwarding Elements 
   in IP routers and similar devices.  In this document we describe the 
   applicability of the ForCES model and protocol.  We provide example 
   deployment scenarios and functionality, as well as document 
   applications that would be inappropriate for ForCES.

1. Purpose 
    
   The purpose of the ForCES Applicability Statement is to capture the 
   intent of the ForCES protocol designers as to how the protocol 
   should be used.  The Applicability Statement will evolve alongside 
   the protocol, and will go to RFC as informational around the same 
   time the as the protocol goes to RFC. 
    
    
2. Overview 
     
   The ForCES protocol defines a standard framework and mechanism for 
   the  exchange  of  information  between  the  logically  separate 
   functionality of the control and data forwarding planes of IP 
   routers and similar devices.  It focuses on the communication 
   necessary for separation of control plane functionality such as 
   routing protocols, signaling protocols, and admission control from 
   data  forwarding  plane  per-packet  activities  such  as  packet 
   forwarding, queuing, and header editing. 
    
   This document defines the applicability of the ForCES mechanisms. It 
   describes types of configurations and settings where ForCES is most 
   appropriately applied.  This document also describes scenarios and 
   configurations where ForCES would not be appropriate for use. 
     
    
3. Terminology 
    
   A set of terminology associated with ForCES is defined in [3, 4]. 
   That terminology is reused here and the reader is directed to [3, 4] 
   for the following definitions: 
    
   o    CE: Control Element. 
    
   o    FE: Forwarding Element. 
    
   o    ForCES: ForCES protocol. 
    
    
4.  Applicability to IP Networks 
 
   The purpose of this section is to list the areas of ForCES 
   applicability in IP network devices.  Relatively low performance

   devices may be implemented on a simple processor which performs both 
   control and packet forwarding functionality.  ForCES is not 
   applicable for such devices. 
    
   Higher performance devices typically distribute work amongst 
   interface processors, and these devices (FEs) therefore need to 
   communicate with the control element(s) to perform their job.  
   ForCES provides a standard way to do this communication. 
    
   The remainder of this section lists the applicable services which 
   ForCES may support, applicable FE functionality, applicable CE-FE 
   link scenarios, and applicable topologies in which ForCES may be 
   deployed. 
    
    
4.1.     Applicable Services 
    
   In this section we describe the applicability of ForCES for the 
   following control-forwarding plane services: 
    
   o    Discovery, Capability Information Exchange 
    
   o    Topology Information Exchange 
    
   o    Configuration 
    
   o    Routing Exchange 
    
   o    QoS Exchange 
    
   o    Security Exchange 
    
   o    Filtering Exchange 
    
   o    Encapsulation/Tunneling Exchange 
    
   o    NAT and Application-level Gateways 
    
   o    Measurement and Accounting 
    
   o    Diagnostics 
    
   o    CE Redundancy or CE Failover

      ForCES Applicability Statement                      July 2006 
 
   Discovery is the process by which CEs and FEs learn of each other's 
   existence.  ForCES assumes that CEs and FEs already know sufficient 
   information to begin communication in a secure manner.  
   The ForCES protocol is only applicable after CEs and FEs have found 
   each other.  ForCES makes no assumption about whether discovery was 
   performed using a dynamic protocol or merely static configuration. 
    
   During the discovery phase, CEs and FEs may exchange capability 
   information with each other.  For example, the FEs may express the 
   number of interface ports they provide, as well as the static and 
   configurable attributes of each port. 
    
   In addition to initial configuration, the CEs and FEs may also 
   exchange dynamic configuration changes using ForCES.  For example, 
   FE's asynchronously inform the CE of an increase/decrease in 
   available resources or capabilities on the FE. 
    
4.1.2.  Topology Information Exchange 
    
   In this context, topology information relates to how the FEs are 
   interconnected with each other with respect to packet forwarding. 
   Whilst topology discovery is outside the scope of the ForCES 
   protocol, a standard topology discovery protocol may be selected and 
   used to "learn" the topology, and then the ForCES protocol may be 
   used to transmit the resulting information to the CE. 
    
4.1.3.  Configuration 
    
   ForCES is used to perform FE configuration.  For example, CEs set 
   configurable FE attributes such as IP addresses, etc. for their 
   interfaces. 
    
4.1.4.  Routing Exchange 
    
   ForCES may be used to deliver packet forwarding information 
   resulting from CE routing calculations.  For example, CEs may send 
   forwarding table updates to the FEs, so that they can make 
   forwarding decisions. FEs may inform the CE in the event of a 
   forwarding table miss. 
    
4.1.5.  QoS Exchange 
    
   ForCES may be used to exchange QoS capabilities between CEs and FEs. 
   For example, an FE may express QoS capabilities to the CE.  Such 
   capabilities might include metering, policing, shaping, and queuing 
   functions.  The CE may use ForCES to configure these capabilities. 
    
4.1.6.  Security Exchange

      ForCES Applicability Statement                      July 2006 
 
    
   ForCES may be used to exchange Security information between CEs and 
   FEs. For example, the FE may use ForCES to express the types of 
   encryption that it is capable of using in an IPsec tunnel.  The CE 
   may use ForCES to configure such a tunnel. 
    
4.1.7.  Filtering Exchange and Firewalls 
    
   ForCES may be used to exchange filtering information.  For example, 
   Fes may use ForCES to express the filtering functions such as 
   classification and action that they can perform, and the CE may 
   configure these capabilities. 
    
4.1.8.  Encapsulation, Tunneling Exchange 
    
   ForCES may be used to exchange encapsulation capabilities of an FE, 
   such as tunneling, and the configuration of such capabilities. 
    
4.1.9.  NAT and Application-level Gateways 
    
   ForCES may be used to exchange configuration information for Network 
   Address Translators.  Whilst ForCES is not specifically designed for 
   the configuration of application-level gateway functionality, this 
   may be in scope for some types of application-level gateways. 
    
4.1.10. Measurement and Accounting 
    
   ForCES may be used to exchange configuration information regarding 
   traffic measurement and accounting functionality.  In this area, 
   ForCES may overlap somewhat with functionality provided by 
   alternative network management mechanisms such as SNMP.  In some 
   cases ForCES may be used to convey information to the CE to be 
   reported externally using SNMP. However, in other cases it may make 
   more sense for the FE to directly speak SNMP. 
    
4.1.11. Diagnostics  
    
   ForCES may be used for CE's and FE's to exchange diagnostic 
   information. For example, an FE can send self-test results to the 
   CE. 
    
4.1.12. CE Redundancy or CE Failover 
    
   ForCES is a master-slave protocol where FE's are slaves and CE's are 
   masters.  Basic mechanisms for CE redundancy/failover are provided 
   in ForCES protocol.  Broad concepts such as implementing CE 
   Redundancy, CE Failover, and CE-CE communication, while not 
   precluded by the ForCES architecture, are considered outside the

      ForCES Applicability Statement                      July 2006 
 
   scope of ForCES protocol. ForCES protocol is designed to handle CE-
   FE communication, and is not intended for CE-CE communication. 
    
4.2.    CE-FE Link Capability 
    
   When using ForCES, the bandwidth of the CE-FE link is a 
   consideration, and cannot be ignored.  For example, sending a full 
   routing table of 110K routes is reasonable over a 100Mbit Ethernet 
   interconnect, but could be non-trivial over a lower-bandwidth link.  
   ForCES should be sufficiently future-proof to be applicable in 
   scenarios where routing tables grow to several orders of magnitude 
   greater than their current size (approximately 100K routes).  
   However, we also note that not all IP routers need full routing 
   tables. 
    
4.3.    CE/FE Locality 
    
   We do not intend ForCES to be applicable in configurations where the 
   CE and FE are located arbitrarily in the network.  In particular, 
   ForCES is intended for environments where one of the following 
   applies: 
    
   o  The control interconnect is some form of local bus, switch, or 
   LAN, where reliability is high, closely controlled, and not 
   susceptible to external disruption that does not also affect the CEs 
   and/or FEs. 
    
   o  The control interconnect shares fate with the FE's forwarding 
   function.  Typically this is because the control connection is also 
   the FE's primary packet forwarding connection, and so if that link 
   goes down, the FE cannot forward packets anyway. 
    
   The key guideline is that the reliability of the device should not 
   be significantly reduced by the separation of control and forwarding 
   functionality. 
    
   ForCES is applicable in localities consisting of control and 
   forwarding elements which are either components in the same physical 
   box, or are separated at most by one local network hop (historically 
   referred to as "Very Close" localities). 
    
   Example: a network element with a single control blade, and one or 
   more forwarding blades, all present in the same chassis and sharing 
   an interconnect such as Ethernet or PCI.  In this locality, the 
   majority of the data traffic being forwarded typically does not 
   traverse the same links as the ForCES control traffic. 
    
5. Limitations and Out-of-Scope Items 


  
Crouch/Handley           Expires January 2007                 [Page 7]



      ForCES Applicability Statement                      July 2006 
 
    
   ForCES was designed to enable logical separation of control and 
   forwarding planes in IP network devices.  However, ForCES is not 
   intended to be applicable to all services or to all possible CE/FE 
   localities. 
    
   The purpose of this section is to list limitations and out-of-scope 
   items for ForCES. 
    
5.1.    Out of Scope Services 
    
   The following control-forwarding plane services are explicitly not 
   addressed by ForCES: 
    
   o    Label Switching 
    
   o    Multimedia Gateway Control (MEGACO). 
    
5.1.1.  Label Switching 
    
   Label Switching is the purview of the GSMP Working Group in the Sub- 
   IP Area of the IETF.  GSMP is a general purpose protocol to control 
   a label switch.  GSMP defines mechanisms to separate the label 
   switch data plane from the control plane label protocols such as LDP 
   [8]. For more information on GSMP, see [7]. 
    
5.1.2.  Separation of Control and Forwarding in Multimedia Gateways 
    
   MEGACO defines a protocol used between elements of a physically 
   decomposed multimedia gateway.  Separation of call control channels 
   from bearer channels is the purview of MEGACO.  For more information 
   on MEGACO, see [9]. 
 
5.2.    Localities  
    
   ForCES protocol was intended to work within the localities described 
   in the last section.  Outside these boundaries, care must be taken 
   or the protocol may not work right.  Examples of localities where 
   ForCES was not originally intended to be used: 
    
   o    Localities where there are multiple hops between CE and FE. 
    
   o    Localities where hops between the CE and FE are dynamically 
   routing using IP routing protocols. 
    
   o    Localities where the loss of the CE-FE link is of non-
   negligible probability.

      ForCES Applicability Statement                      July 2006 
 
   o    Localities where two or more FEs controlled by the same CE 
   cannot communicate, either directly, or indirectly via other Fes 
   controlled by the same CE. 
 
6. Security Considerations  
    
   The security of ForCES protocol will be addressed in the Protocol 
   Specification [6]. For security requirements, see architecture 
   requirement #5 and protocol requirement #2 in the Requirements Draft 
   [3].  The ForCES protocol assumes that the CE and FE are in the same 
   administration, and have shared secrets as a means of 
   administration. Whilst it might be technically feasible to have the 
   CE and FE administered independently, we strongly discourage such 
   uses, because they would require a significantly different trust 
   model from that ForCES assumes. 
    
7. ForCES Manageability  
   From the management perspective, an NE can be viewed in at least two 
   ways.  From one perspective, it is a single network element, 
   specifically a router that needs to be managed in essentially the 
   same way any router is managed.  From another perspective element 
   management can view the individual entities and interfaces that make 
   up a ForCES NE. 
    
7.1.    NE as an atomic element 
    
   From the ForCES requirements RFC [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 4:   
        
      A NE MUST support the appearance of a single functional device.  
    
   As a single functional device a ForCES NE runs protocols and each of 
   the protocols has it own existing manageability aspects that are 
   document elsewhere.  As a router it would also have a configuration 
   interface.  When viewed in this manner, the NE is controlled as 
   single routing entity and no new management beyond what is already 
   available for routers and routing protocols would be required for a 
   ForCES NE. 
    
7.2.    NE as composed of manageable elements  
    
   When viewed as a decomposed set of elements from the management 
   perspective, the ForCES NE is divided into a set of one of more 
   Control Elements, Forwarding Elements and the interfaces between 
   them. The interface functionality between the CE and the FE is 
   provided by the ForCES protocol.  As with all IETF protocols a MIB 
   is provided for the purposes of managing the protocol.

      ForCES Applicability Statement                      July 2006 
 
   Additionally the architecture makes provision for configuration 
   control of the individual CEs and FEs. This is handled by elements 
   named FE manager (FEM) and the CE manager (CEM). Specifically from 
   the ForCES requirements 
   RFC [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 4:  
    
      However, external entities (e.g., FE managers and CE managers) 
      MAY have direct access to individual ForCES protocol elements  
      for providing information to transition them from the  
      pre-association to post-association phase.  
    
7.3.    ForCES Protocol MIB 
    
   From the ForCES MIB RFC [TBD], section X 
    
      The ForCES MIB is a primarily read-only MIB that captures 
      information related to the ForCES protocol. This includes  
      state information about the associations between CE(s) and  
      FE(s) in the NE.   
        
   The ForCES MIB does not include information that is specified in 
   other MIBs, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.   
        
   More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB relative to 
   associations includes:   
    
   - identifiers of the elements in the association   
   - state of the association   
   - configuration parameters of the association   
   - statistics of the association   
    
7.3.1.  MIB Management of an FE 
    
   While it is possible to manage a FE from a element manager, several 
   requirements relating to this have been included in the ForCES 
   Requirements. 
        
   From the ForCES Requirements [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 14:  
           
     1. The ability for a management tool (e.g., SNMP) to be used  
        to read (but not change) the state of FE SHOULD NOT be 
        precluded.   
    
     2. It MUST NOT be possible for management tools  
        (e.g., SNMP, etc) to change the state of a FE in a manner  
        that affects overall NE behavior without the CE being  
        notified.  
          



  
Crouch/Handley           Expires January 2007                [Page 10]



      ForCES Applicability Statement                      July 2006 
 
   The ForCES Requirements [RFC 3746], Section 5.7, goes further in 
   discussing the manner in which FEs should handle management requests 
   that are specifically directed to the FE:    
          
       RFC 1812 [2] also dictates that "Routers MUST be manageable  
       by SNMP". In general, for the post-association phase, most  
       external management tasks (including SNMP) should be done  
       through interaction with the CE in order to support the 
       appearance of a single functional device. Therefore, it is 
       recommended that an SNMP agent be implemented by CEs and 
       that the SNMP messages received by FEs be redirected to their 
       CEs. AgentX framework defined in RFC 2741 ([6]) may be applied 
       here such that CEs act in the role of master agent to process 
       SNMP protocol messages while FEs act in the role of subagent  
       to provide access to the MIB objects residing on FEs.  AgentX 
       protocol messages between the master agent (CE) and the  
       subagent (FE) are encapsulated and transported via ForCES,  
       just like data packets from any other application layer 
       protocols.  
     
       
7.4.    CE to CE communication 
    
   The ForCES architecture allows for multiple CEs within a single NE.  
   The operating presumption is that the CEs will coordinate their 
   efforts in those cases where multiple CEs are available.  Currently 
   the only specified method for CE to interact with FE is for there to 
   be one master CE, though there can be many backup CEs. Other 
   solutions that have been discussed include having multiple 
   specialist CEs per FE, however, the protocol does not support this 
   option. 
    
   The creation of a protocol or method for CE coordination is out of 
   scope for the initial ForCES specification effort.  Any NE that uses 
   multiple CEs for reliability must provide its own coordination 
   mechanisms. 
    
7.5.    The FEM and CEM 
    
   Though out of scope for the initial ForCES specification effort, the 
   ForCES architecture include two entities, the CE Manager (CEM) and 
   the FE Manager (FEM) 
    
   From the ForCES Protocols Specification [RFCXXXX] 
    
      CE Manager (CEM) - A logical entity responsible for generic CE 
      management tasks.  It is particularly used during the
