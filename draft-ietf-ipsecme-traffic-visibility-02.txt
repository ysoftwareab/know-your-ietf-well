   This document describes the Wrapped Encapsulating Security 
   Payload (WESP) protocol, which builds on top of ESP [RFC4303] 
   and is designed to allow intermediate devices to ascertain if 
   ESP-NULL is being employed and hence inspect the IPsec packets 
   for network monitoring and access control functions.  Currently 
   in the IPsec standard, there is no way to differentiate between 
   ESP encryption and ESP NULL encryption by simply examining a 
   packet. This poses certain challenges to the intermediate 
   devices that need to deep inspect the packet before making a 
   decision on what should be done with that packet (Inspect and/or 
   Allow/Drop). The mechanism described in this document can be 
   used to easily disambiguate ESP-NULL from ESP encrypted packets, 
   without compromising on the security provided by ESP.

1. Introduction 

   Use of ESP within IPsec [RFC4303] specifies how ESP packet 
   encapsulation is performed.  It also specifies that ESP can use 
   NULL encryption [RFC2410] while preserving data integrity and 
   authenticity.  The exact encapsulation and algorithms employed 
   are negotiated out-of-band using, for example, IKEv2 [RFC4306] 
   and based on policy.  

   Enterprise environments typically employ numerous security 
   policies (and tools for enforcing them), as related to access 
   control, content screening, firewalls, network monitoring 
   functions, deep packet inspection, Intrusion Detection and 
   Prevention Systems (IDS and IPS), scanning and detection of 
   viruses and worms, etc.  In order to enforce these policies, 
   network tools and intermediate devices require visibility into

   packets, ranging from simple packet header inspection to deeper 
   payload examination.  Network security protocols which encrypt 
   the data in transit prevent these network tools from performing 
   the aforementioned functions.  

   When employing IPsec within an enterprise environment, it is 
   desirable to employ ESP instead of AH [RFC4302], as AH does not 
   work in NAT environments. Furthermore, in order to preserve the 
   above network monitoring functions, it is desirable to use ESP-
   NULL. In a mixed mode environment some packets containing 
   sensitive data employ a given encryption cipher suite, while 
   other packets employ ESP-NULL. For an intermediate device to 
   unambiguously distinguish which packets are leveraging ESP-NULL, 
   they would require knowledge of all the policies being employed 
   for each protected session. This is clearly not practical. 
   Heuristic-based methods can be employed to parse the packets, 
   but these can be very expensive, containing numerous rules based 
   on each different protocol and payload.  Even then, the parsing 
   may not be robust in cases where fields within a given encrypted 
   packet happen to resemble the fields for a given protocol or 
   heuristic rule.  This is even more problematic when different 
   length Initialization Vectors (IVs), Integrity Check Values 
   (ICVs) and padding are used for different security associations, 
   making it difficult to determine the start and end of the 
   payload data, let alone attempting any further parsing.  
   Furthermore, storage, lookup and cross-checking a set of 
   comprehensive rules against every packet adds cost to hardware 
   implementations and degrades performance. In cases where the 
   packets may be encrypted, it is also wasteful to check against 
   heuristics-based rules, when a simple exception policy (e.g., 
   allow, drop or redirect) can be employed to handle the encrypted 
   packets. Because of the non-deterministic nature of heuristics-
   based rules for disambiguating between encrypted and non-
   encrypted data, an alternative method for enabling intermediate 
   devices to function in encrypted data environments needs to be 
   defined. Additionally there are many types and classes of 
   network devices employed within a given network and a 
   deterministic approach would provide a simple solution for all 
   these devices. Enterprise environments typically use both 
   stateful and stateless packet inspection mechanisms. The 
   previous considerations weigh particularly heavy on stateless 
   mechanisms such as router ACLs and NetFlow exporters. 
   Nevertheless, a deterministic approach provides a simple 
   solution for the myriad types of devices employed within a 
   network, regardless of their stateful or stateless nature. 

   This document defines a mechanism to provide additional 
   information in relevant IPsec packets so intermediate devices

   can efficiently differentiate between encrypted ESP packets and 
   ESP packets with NULL encryption. 

   The document is consistent with the operation of ESP in NAT 
   environments [RFC3947]. 

   The design principles for this protocol are the following: 

   o  Allow easy identification and parsing of integrity-only IPsec 
   traffic 

   o  Leverage the existing hardware IPsec parsing engines as much 
   as possible to minimize additional hardware design costs 

   o  Minimize the packet overhead in the common case 

1.1. Requirements Language 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

1.2. Applicability Statement 

   The document is applicable only to the wrapped ESP header 
   defined below, and does not describe any changes to either ESP 
   [RFC4303] nor AH [RFC4302]. 

2. Wrapped ESP (WESP) Header format 

   The proposal is to define a protocol number for Wrapped ESP 
   encapsulation (WESP), which provides additional attributes in 
   each packet to assist in differentiating between encrypted and 
   non-encrypted data, as well as aid parsing of the packet. WESP 
   follows RFC 4303 for all IPv6 and IPv4 considerations (e.g., 
   alignment considerations). 

   This extension essentially acts as a wrapper to the existing ESP 
   protocol and provides an additional 4 octets at the front of the 
   existing ESP packet.  

   This may be depicted as follows:

   By preserving the body of the existing ESP packet format, a 
   compliant implementation can simply add in the new header, 
   without needing to change the body of the packet. The value of 
   the new protocol used to identify this new header is TBD via 
   IANA. Further details are shown below:

       2 bits: Version. Version is set to 0 by the transmitter and 
   validated by the receiver. Any modifications to the WESP header 
   in the future will require an update in the version number. 

       6 bits: reserved for future use.  These MUST be set to zero 
   per this specification, but usage may be defined by other 
   specifications.  

   Note: To provide future compatibility, the version number is 
   negotiated by the control channel handshake. An implementation 
   compatible with this specification must set the version number 
   and the reserved bits to the values specified above when

   transmitting a packet. On receiving a packet, these values must 
   be checked to ensure that they are as indicated above.  

   Next Header, 8 bits:  If using ESP-NULL, this field MUST be 
   equal to the Next Header field in the ESP trailer. If using ESP 
   in encryption mode, this field MUST be set to zero.. 

   HdrLen, 8 bits: Offset to the beginning of the Payload Data in 
   octets. 

   TrailerLen, 8 bits: Offset from the end of the packet to the 
   last byte of the payload data in octets. 

   As can be seen, this wrapped ESP format extends the standard ESP 
   header by the first 4 octets. The WESP header is integrity 
   protected, along with all the fields specified for ESP in RFC 
   4303.  

2.1. UDP Encapsulation 

   This section describes a mechanism for running the new packet 
   format over the existing UDP encapsulation of ESP as defined in 
   RFC 3948. This allows leveraging the existing IKE negotiation of 
   the UDP port for NAT-T discovery and usage [RFC3947], as well as 
   preserving the existing UDP ports for ESP (port 4500).  With UDP 
   encapsulation, the packet format can be depicted as follows.  

  0                   1                   2                   3

   Source/Destination port (4500) and checksum: describes the UDP 
   encapsulation header, per RFC3948. 

   Protocol Identifier: new field to demultiplex between UDP 
   encapsulation of IKE, UDP encapsulation of ESP per RFC 3948, and  
   the UDP encapsulation in this specification. 

   According to RFC 3948, clause 2.2, a 4 octet value of zero (0) 
   immediately following the UDP header indicates a Non-ESP marker, 
   which can be used to assume that the data following that value 
   is an IKE packet.  Similarly, a value greater then 255 indicates 
   that the packet is an ESP packet and the 4-octet value can be 
   treated as the ESP SPI. However, RFC 4303, clause 2.1 indicates 
   that the values 1-255 are reserved and cannot be used as the 
   SPI.  We leverage that knowledge and use one of these reserved 
   values to indicate that the UDP encapsulated ESP header contains 
   this new packet format for ESP encapsulation. 

   The remaining fields in the packet have the same meaning as per 
   section 2 above. 

2.2. Transport and Tunnel Mode Considerations 

   This extension is equally applicable for transport and tunnel 
   mode where the ESP Next Header field is used to differentiate 
   between these modes, as per the existing IPsec specifications. 

2.2.1. Transport Mode Processing 

   In transport mode, ESP is inserted after the IP header and before a 
   next layer protocol, e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc. The following 
   diagrams illustrate how WESP is applied to the ESP transport mode for 
   a typical packet, on a "before and after" basis.

2.3. IKE Considerations 

   This document assumes that WESP negotiation is performed using 
   IKEv2. In order to negotiate the new format of ESP encapsulation

   via IKEv2 [RFC4306], both parties need to agree to use the new 
   packet format. This can be achieved using a notification method 
   similar to USE_TRANSPORT_MODE defined in RFC 4306. 

   The notification, USE_WESP_MODE (value TBD) MAY be included in a 
   request message that also includes an SA payload requesting a 
   CHILD_SA using ESP.  It requests that the CHILD_SA use WESP mode 
   rather than ESP for the SA created.  If the request is accepted, 
   the response MUST also include a notification of type 
   USE_WESP_MODE. If the responder declines the request, the 
   CHILD_SA will be established using ESP, as per RFC 4303.  If 
   this is unacceptable to the initiator, the initiator MUST delete 
   the SA.  Note: Except when using this option to negotiate  WESP 
   mode, all CHILD_SAs will use standard ESP. 

   Negotiation of WESP in this manner preserves all other 
   negotiation parameters, including NAT-T [RFC3948]. NAT-T is 
   wholly compatible with this wrapped frame format and can be used 
   as-is, without any modifications, in environments where NAT is 
   present and needs to be taken into account. 

3. Security Considerations 

   As this document augments the existing ESP encapsulation format, 
   UDP encapsulation definitions specified in RFC 3948 and IKE 
   negotiation of the new encapsulation, the security observations 
   made in those documents also apply here. In addition, as this 
   document allows intermediate device visibility into IPsec ESP 
   encapsulated frames for the purposes of network monitoring 
   functions, care should be taken not to send sensitive data over 
   connections using definitions from this document, based on 
   network domain/administrative policy. A strong key agreement 
   protocol, such as IKE, together with a strong policy engine 
   should be used to in determining appropriate security policy for 
   the given traffic streams and data over which it is being 
   employed.  

   ESP is end-to-end and it will be impossible for the intermediate 
   devices to verify that all the fields in the WESP header are 
   correct. It is thus possible to tweak the WESP header so that 
   the packet sneaks past the firewall if the fields in the WESP 
   header are set to something that the firewall will allow. The 
   endpoint thus must verify the sanity of the WESP header before 
   accepting the packet. In an extreme case, someone colluding with 
   the attacker, could change the WESP fields back to the original 
   values so that the attack goes unnoticed. However, this is not a 
   new problem and it already exists IPSec.

4. IANA Considerations 

   Reserving an appropriate value for this encapsulation as well as 
   a new value for the protocol in the IKE negotiation is TBD by 
   IANA.
