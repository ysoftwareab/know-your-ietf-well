Abstract

   This document describes an extension to Transport Layer Security

1.  Introduction

   WebRTC [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] creates a new understanding of the
   way that "user-generated content" is used on the world wide web.  The
   established definition identifies content that is generated by users
   and used by sites; after all, the primary mode of interaction on the
   web is between users and sites.

   WebRTC changes that by enabling users to communicate directly, with
   secure channels between established between user agents (or
   browsers).  These channels might be established with the aid of a web
   site, but the content of the communication session can be made
   inaccessible to the site [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch].  With peer
   authentication, each user is able to be sure that:

   o  the content they are generating is only accessible to the
      authenticated peer; and

   o  the content they are receiving can be attributed solely to the
      authenticated peer.

   On the originating end of a communications session, this guarantee is
   easy to provide.  A web site is able to provide instructions for
   session setup that allow the browser to protect content from the
   site, and to restrict where content is delivered based on identity.

   On the receiving side, this is more complicated.  Since there is a
   desire to enable use cases where sites do have access to content that
   is received, there is a need for a signal of some form to distinguish
   the cases.

   It is possible to use the WebRTC signaling channel for this purpose,
   but only with restrictions.  The signaling channel is considered
   untrustworthy, so additional protection would be required to ensure

   that any indicators could not be erased or re-attributed to other
   keying material.  Furthermore, this would also require protection
   against replay.  Prohibiting key reuse between confidential and non-
   confidential sessions would suffice for this purpose, though this is
   undesirable for other reasons.

1.1.  Authenticated Content Promise

   This document describes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246]
   extension, which, if negotiated, establishes a session as being
   confidential.  Peers that negotiate this extension promise that:

   o  Any content that is written to or read from the connection MUST be
      protected from modification by entities other than the one that is
      authenticated (i.e., the user).

   o  Any content that is written to or read from the connection MUST
      NOT be recorded or forwarded to any entity other than the one that
      is authenticated.

   In addition to establishing an authenticated channel for
   communications, this provides a key advantage over signaling-based
   methods for ensuring privacy.  Key continuity is possible, which
   allows clients to operate without identity providers and still have a
   stable basis for establishing continuity of identity with peers.

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   At times, this document falls back on shorthands for establishing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  These terms are defined in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Authenticated Content Promise

   A new extension type ("authenticated_content_promise(TBD)") is
   defined.  If this extension is negotiated, both client and server are
   bound by a promise to protect content.

   enum {
       authenticated_content_promise(TBD), (65535)
   } ExtensionType;

   The "extension_data" field of this extension MUST be empty.

3.  Security Considerations

   Endpoints need to take care to avoid rendering of authenticated
   content alongside other content in a way that could cause user
   confusion equivalent to the effect of modifying content.  For
   instance, unauthenticated audio could be played at higher volume
   levels than authenticated audio, potentially misleading users about
   what sounds can be attributed to each.

   This looks a little like digital rights management (DRM), but it
   really doesn't promise to protect content to the degree required by
   DRM schemes.  It relies solely on users and their trust each other
   (and their user agents, operating system and hardware).  Nothing in
   this mechanism stops a compromised end system from modifying or
   eavesdropping on communications, from information being overhead or
   seen by people nearby, or from any action taken on the part of the
   authentiated entities, such as screen recording.

   A little care is needed to avoid side channels, some of which are
   quite obvious.  For example, even with echo cancellation, audio
   played over speakers can be picked up by nearby microphones; video
   playback might be observable in a mirror.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated a TLS extension code point of (TBD) for this
   extension.
