2.  Introduction

   This document describes a number of changes to the TCP congestion
   control algorithm to to improve performance in high bandwidth-delay
   product paths.

   The current TCP congestion control algorithm is known to perform
   poorly on paths where the TCP congestion window becomes large.
   [Kelly02, Flo03, FAST04].  Following congestion, the congestion
   window is halved and only increases at a rate of 1 packet per RTT.
   As a result flows can take an unacceptably long time to recover their
   window size after a congestion event.

   A direct solution is to make the time between congestion events
   smaller.  This can be achieved by, for example, adjusting the AIMD
   additive increase rate to be greater for flows with larger congestion
   window.  Backward compatibility with legacy TCP can be ensured
   through the inclusion of a separate mode of operation that behaves as
   legacy TCP in the appropriate circumstances.

   The logic that orchestrates switching between the legacy and more
   aggressive modes of operation can clearly be designed several ways.
   One approach is to make the AIMD increase parameter, which we denote
   here by alpha, a function of the flow congestion window.  That is,
   alpha is increased as congestion window increases thereby resulting
   in an additive increase algorithm that directly scales with
   congestion window.  This is precisely the approach adopted in the
   High-Speed TCP [Flo03] proposal.  In addition to adjusting the AIMD
   increase parameter alpha as a function of congestion window, this
   proposal also increases the multiplicative decrease factor beta to
   further increase the aggressiveness of a flow.  (Note.  On
   multiplicative decrease, the congestion window cwnd is updated to
   beta x cwnd.  We use this definition of the backoff factor beta
   throughout this document).

   While such modifications might appear straightforward, it has been
   shown [Sho04, Yi05] that they often negatively impact the behaviour
   of networks of TCP flows.  High-speed TCP[Flo03], BIC-TCP [BIC04] and
   Cubic can exhibit slow convergence following network disturbances
   such as the start-up of new flows; Scalable-TCP [Kelly02] is a
   multiplicative-increase multiplicative-decrease strategy and as such
   it is known that it may fail to converge to fairness in drop-tail
   networks [Jain89].

   Scope
   -----

   Our focus in this document is on the behaviour of long-lived flows

   and so we do not consider changes to slow-start.  We also seek to
   make the smallest possible changes to the existing TCP congestion
   control algorithm, and so confine consideration to the AIMD packet-
   loss based paradigm.  Use of jumbo packets is viewed as complementary
   to the changes proposed here.

3.  Additive Increase for High Bandwidth-Delay Product Paths

   It is known that modifying the AIMD backoff factor can have a
   significant impact on network responsiveness, and this is discussed
   in more detail elsewhere [Sho04, Sho05].  In this document we confine
   attention to modifications to the AIMD increase rate with the aim of
   improving performance in high bandwidth-delay product paths.  We
   begin with the observation that making the AIMD increase rate an
   increasing function of flow cwnd (as is done in the HS-TCP, BIC,
   Cubic etc algorithms) means that flows with smaller cwnd are placed
   at a disadvantage to flows with larger cwnd when competing for
   bandwidth.  This is a primary source of unfairness and slow
   convergence.  We therefore take an alternative approach.  Noting that
   it is the increase in congestion epoch duration with bandwidth-delay
   product that is the source of many issues, we make the AIMD increase
   rate purely a function of the elapsed time since the last congestion
   event.  This allows us to increase the aggressiveness of the AIMD
   increase as the congestion epoch duration increases (so improving
   performance in high bandwidth-delay product paths) while avoiding
   placing flows with small cwnd at a consistent disadvantage.

   RFC2591 specifies that during congestion avoidance, cwnd is
   incremented by 1 full-sized segment per round-trip time (RTT).  We
   modify this behaviour to increase cwnd by alpha segments per RTT,
   where alpha is calculated as follows.

   if Delta <= Delta_L
      alpha  = 1
   else
      alpha = f_alpha(Delta)

   where Delta is the time in seconds that has elapsed since the last
   congestion event experienced by a flow and Delta_L is the threshold
   for switching from standard/legacy operation to the new increase
   function.  Delta_L MUST be at least 1 second, although larger values
   MAY be used.  The increase function f_alpha is selected such that the
   duration of the congestion epochs remains reasonably small as the
   bandwidth-delay product on a path increases.  Below, we discuss a
   choice of increase function that yields convergence times that seem
   reasonable.  However, the precise responsiveness requirement in
   future networks is currently not well defined and so the specific
   choice of increase function may change.

   Use of the following increase function is RECOMMENDED:

   f_alpha(Delta) = 1 + 10(Delta-Delta_L)+0.5(Delta-Delta_L)^2   (1)

   This choice yields the congestion epoch duration for a single flow,

4.  Impact of Changes on Performance

4.1.  RTT unfairness

   The level of unfairness between flows with different RTT's is similar
   to that with the standard TCP algorithm.  This behaviour is confirmed
   in experimental and simulation tests [HTCP04, Yi05].

4.2.  Friendliness

   The mean AIMD increase parameter is shown in Table 2 for a range of
   bandwidth-delay products.  This an indication of the number of
   standard TCP flows (neglecting statistical multiplexing of backoffs)
   whose aggregate would be equivalent to a flow using increase function
   (1).  That is, an indication of friendliness and also of the packet
   drop overhead associated with the AIMD probing action.

   size

4.3.  Responsiveness

   Responsiveness is qualitatively similar to that of the current AIMD
   congestion control algorithm, i.e. the convergence time of TCP flows
   using an AIMD backoff factor of 0.5 is approximately 4 congestion
   epochs, although the congestion epoch duration is significantly
   shorter on high bandwidth-delay product paths (see Table 1).

4.4.  Efficiency

   Link utilisation depends on queue provisioning in a similar manner to
   the current TCP congestion control algorithm.  That is, for a single
   flow (or multiple synchronised flows) 100% link utilisation requires
   that the queue be sized as the bandwidth-delay product.  Simulation

   and experimental tests indicate that statistical multiplexing between
   unsynchronised flows yields similar efficiency gains to standard TCP.

5.  Optional RTT Scaling

   We note that the parameter alpha determines the AIMD increase rate in
   packets per RTT.  Hence, flows with the same RTT have the same
   increase rate in packets per second, but flows with different RTTs
   have different increase rate in packets per second.  It is this that
   primarily leads to unfairness between flows with different RTTs.
   Removing RTT unfairness is not one of our objectives here.  However,
   we note that an AIMD flow generates roughly alpha packet drops per
   RTT as a result of its probing action.  Hence, flows with short RTT
   are more aggressive than flows with long RTT in the sense that they
   generate more packet drops over intervals of time measured in
   seconds.  We can reduce the aggressiveness of short RTT flows by
   scaling the increase parameter alpha with RTT.  This need not
   compromise the responsiveness of TCP flows.  As noted in [Sh04, Sh05,
   HTCP04], the convergence time of TCP flows using an AIMD backoff
   factor of 0.5 is approximately 4 congestion epochs.  Scaling alpha by
   RTT leads to scaling of the congestion epoch duration to become
   effectively the same for both short and long RTT flows.  The
   convergence time is therefore also scaled to be effectively the same
   for both short and long RTT flows.

   Such RTT scaling MAY be implemented by modifying the increase rule to

   if Delta <= Delta_L
      alpha  = 1
   else
      alpha = K x f_alpha(Delta)

   where K = RTT/RTT_ref.  Note that RTT scaling is not applied in low-
   speed conditions in order to maintain backward compatibility with
   legacy TCP flows (ensuring adequate backward compatibility presented
   a major difficulty in previous studies on the use of RTT scaling).
   Note also that the scaling is proportional to RTT rather than RTT^2,
   as we do not seek to achieve throughput fairness here.  RTT_ref is
   the reference RTT for which f_alpha is designed to ensure acceptable
   congestion epoch durations, with the recommended value being 100ms.
