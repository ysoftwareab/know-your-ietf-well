   Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal
                           Channel Call Home
                  draft-ietf-dots-signal-call-home-06

Abstract

   This document specifies the DOTS signal channel Call Home, which
   enables a DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a DOTS
   client, and to receive the attack traffic information from the DOTS
   client.  The DOTS server in turn uses the attack traffic information
   to identify the compromised devices launching the outgoing DDoS
   attack and takes appropriate mitigation action(s).

   The DOTS signal channel Call Home is not specific to the home
   networks; the solution targets any deployment which requires to block
   DDoS attack traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  The Problem

   The DOTS signal channel protocol [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] is
   used to carry information about a network resource or a network (or a
   part thereof) that is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
   attack [RFC4732].  Such information is sent by a DOTS client to one
   or multiple DOTS servers so that appropriate mitigation actions are
   undertaken on traffic deemed suspicious.  Various use cases are
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases].

   Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more prevalent
   in home networks, in particular.  With compute and memory becoming
   cheaper and cheaper, various types of IoT devices become available in
   the consumer market at affordable prices.  But on the downside, the
   main threat being most of these IoT devices are bought off-the-shelf
   and most manufacturers haven't considered security in the product
   design (e.g., [Sec]).  IoT devices deployed in home networks can be
   easily compromised, they do not have an easy mechanism to upgrade,
   and IoT manufactures may cease manufacture and/or discontinue
   patching vulnerabilities on IoT devices (Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of
   [RFC8576]).  These vulnerable and compromised devices will continue
   to be used for a long period of time in the home, and the end-user
   does not know that IoT devices in his/her home are compromised.  The
   compromised IoT devices are typically used for launching DDoS attacks
   (Section 3 of [RFC8576]) on victims while the owner/administrator of
   the home network is not aware about such misbehaviors.  Similar to
   other DDoS attacks, the victim in this attack can be an application
   server, a host, a router, a firewall, or an entire network.  Such

   misbehaviors will have a collateral damage that affects end users and
   the reputation of an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

   Nowadays, network devices in a home network offer network security
   (e.g., firewall [RFC4949] or Intrusion Protection System (IPS)
   service [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology] on a home router) to protect the
   devices connected to the home network from both external and internal
   attacks.  Over the years several techniques have been identified to
   detect DDoS attacks, some of these techniques can be enabled on home
   network devices but most of them are used within the ISP's network.
   The ISP offering a DDoS mitigation service can detect outgoing DDoS
   attack traffic originating from its subscribers or the ISP may
   receive filtering rules (e.g., using BGP Flowspec
   [RFC5575][I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6]) from a downstream service
   provider to filter, block, or rate-limit DDoS attack traffic
   originating from the ISP's subscribers to a downstream target.

   Some of the DDoS attacks like spoofed RST or FIN packets, Slowloris,
   and Transport Layer Security (TLS) re-negotiation are difficult to
   detect on a home network device without adversely affecting its
   performance.  The reason is typically home devices such as home
   routers have fast path to boost the throughput.  For every new TCP/
   UDP flow, only the first few packets are punted through the slow
   path.  Hence, it is not possible to detect various DDoS attacks in
   the slow path, since the attack payload is sent to the target server
   after the flow is switched to fast path.  The reader may refer to
   Section 2 of [RFC6398] for a brief definition of slow and fast paths.

   Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of all the packets of a flow would be
   able to detect some of the attacks.  However, a full-fledged DPI to
   detect these type of DDoS attacks is functionally or operationally
   not possible for all the devices attached to the home network owing
   to the memory and CPU limitations of the home routers.  Furthermore,
   for certain DDoS attacks the ability to distinguish legitimate
   traffic from attack traffic on a per packet basis is complex.  This
   complexity is due to that the packet itself may look "legitimate" and
   no attack signature can be identified.  The anomaly can be identified
   only after detailed statistical analysis.

   ISPs can detect some DDoS attacks originating from a home network
   (e.g., Section 2.6 of [RFC8517]), but the ISP does not have a
   mechanism to detect which device in the home network is generating
   the DDoS attack traffic.  The primary reason being that devices in an
   IPv4 home network are typically behind a Network Address Translation
   (NAT) border [RFC2663].  Even in case of an IPv6 home network,
   although the ISP can identify the infected device in the home network
   launching the DDoS traffic by tracking its unique IPv6 address, the

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


   infected device can easily change its IPv6 address to evade
   remediation.

   Existing approaches are still suffering from misused access network
   resources by abusing devices; the support of means for blocking such
   attacks close to the sources are missing.  In particular, the DOTS
   signal protocol does not discuss cooperative DDoS mitigation between
   the network hosting an attack source and the ISP to the suppress the
   outbound DDoS attack traffic originating from that network.

1.2.  The Solution

   This specification addresses the problems discussed in Section 1.1
   and presents an extension to the DOTS signal channel: DOTS signal
   channel Call Home.

   'DOTS signal channel Call Home' (or DOTS Call Home, for short) refers
   to a DOTS signal channel established at the initiative of a DOTS
   server.  That is, the DOTS server initiates a secure connection to a
   DOTS client, and uses that connection to receive the attack traffic
   information (e.g., attack sources) from the DOTS client.  More
   details are provided in Section 3.

   DOTS agents involved in the DOTS Call Home adhere to the DOTS roles
   as defined in [RFC8612].  For clarity, this document uses "Call Home
   DOTS client" (or "Call Home DOTS server") to refer to a DOTS client
   (or DOTS server) deployed in a Call Home scenario (Figure 1).

   A high-level DOTS Call Home functional architecture is shown in
   Figure 1.  Attack source(s) are within the DOTS server domain.

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


   A DOTS client relies upon a variety of triggers to make use of the
   Call Home function (e.g., scrubbing the traffic from the attack
   source, receiving an alert from an attack target, a peer DDoS
   Mitigation System (DMS), or a transit provider).  The definition of
   these triggers is deployment-specific.  It is therefore out of the
   scope of this document to elaborate on how these triggers are made
   available to a Call Home DOTS client.

   In a typical deployment scenario, the Call Home DOTS server is
   enabled on a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), which is aligned with
   recent trends to enrich the CPE with advanced security features.
   Unlike classic DOTS deployments [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases], such DOTS
   server maintains a single DOTS signal channel session for each DOTS-
   capable upstream provisioning domain [I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming].

   For instance, the Call Home DOTS server in the home network initiates
   the signal channel Call Home in 'idle' time and then subsequently the
   Call Home DOTS client in the ISP environment can initiate a
   mitigation request whenever the ISP detects there is an attack from a
   compromised device in the DOTS server domain (i.e., from within the
   home network).

   The Call Home DOTS server uses the DDoS attack traffic information to
   identify the compromised device in its domain that is responsible for
   launching the DDoS attack, optionally notifies a network
   administrator, and takes appropriate mitigation action(s).  For
   example, a mitigation action can be to quarantine the compromised
   device or block its traffic to the attack target(s) until the
   mitigation request is withdrawn.

   Other motivations for introducing the Call Home function are
   discussed in Section 1.1 of [RFC8071].

   This document assumes that Call Home DOTS servers are provisioned
   with a way to know how to reach the upstream Call Home DOTS
   client(s), which could occur by a variety of means (e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-dots-server-discovery]).  The specification of such means
   are out of scope of this document.

   More information about the applicability scope of the DOTS signal
   channel Call Home is provided in Section 1.3.

1.3.  Applicability Scope

   The aforementioned problems may be encountered in other deployments
   than those discussed in Section 1.1 (e.g., data centers, enterprise
   networks).  The solution specified in this document can be used for

   those deployments to block DDoS attack traffic closer to the
   source(s) of the attack.

   An instantiation of the Call Home functional architecture is depicted
   in Figure 2.

1.4.  Co-existence of Base DOTS Signal Channel & DOTS Call Home

   The DOTS signal channel Call Home does not require nor preclude the
   activation of the base DOTS signal channel
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].  Some sample deployment schemes are
   discussed in this section for illustration purposes.

   The network that hosts an attack source may also be subject to
   inbound DDoS attacks.  In that case, both the base DOTS signal
   channel and DOTS signal channel Call Home may be enabled as shown in
   Figure 3 (Same DMS provider) or Figure 4 (Distinct DMS providers).

   Note that a DMS provider may not be on the default forwarding path of
   an inbound DDoS attack traffic targeting a network (e.g., Network #B
   in Figure 4).  Nevertheless, the DOTS signal channel Call Home
   requires the DMS provider to be on the default forwarding path of the
   outbound traffic from a given network.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in [RFC8612].

   'Base DOTS signal channel' refers to [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].

   The meaning of the symbols in YANG tree diagrams is defined in
   [RFC8340].

   (D)TLS is used for statements that apply to both Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC8446] and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [RFC6347].  Specific terms are used for any statement that applies to
   either protocol alone.

3.  DOTS Signal Channel Call Home

3.1.  Procedure

   The DOTS signal channel Call Home preserves all but one of the DOTS
   client/server roles in the DOTS protocol stack, as compared to DOTS
   client-initiated DOTS signal channel protocol
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].  The role reversal that occurs is at
   the (D)TLS layer; that is, (1) the Call Home DOTS server acts as a
   DTLS client and the Call Home DOTS client acts as a DTLS server or
   (2) the Call Home DOTS server acts as a TLS client initiating the
   underlying TCP connection and the Call Home DOTS client acts as a TLS
   server.  The Call Home DOTS server initiates (D)TLS handshake to the
   Call Home DOTS client.

   For example, a home network element (e.g., home router) co-located
   with a Call Home DOTS server is the (D)TLS server.  However, when
   calling home, the DOTS server initially assumes the role of the
   (D)TLS client, but the network element's role as a DOTS server
   remains the same.  Furthermore, existing certificate chains and
   mutual authentication mechanisms between the DOTS agents are
   unaffected by the Call Home function.  This Call Home function
   enables the DOTS server co-located with a network element (possibly
   behind NATs and firewalls) reachable by only the intended Call Home
   DOTS client and hence the Call Home DOTS server cannot be subjected
   to these DDoS attacks.

   Figure 7 illustrates a sample DOTS Call Home flow exchange:

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


   The DOTS signal channel Call Home procedure is as follows:

   1.  If UDP transport is used, the Call Home DOTS server begins by
       initiating a DTLS connection to the Call Home DOTS client.

       If TCP is used, the Call Home DOTS server begins by initiating a
       TCP connection to the Call Home DOTS client.  Using this TCP
       connection, the Call Home DOTS server initiates a TLS connection
       to the Call Home DOTS client.

       In some cases, peer DOTS agents may have mutual agreement to use
       a specific port number, such as by explicit configuration or
       dynamic discovery [I-D.ietf-dots-server-discovery].  Absent such
       mutual agreement, the DOTS signal channel Call Home MUST run over
       port number TBD (that is, Call Home DOTS clients must support
       accepting DTLS (or TCP) connections on TBD) as defined in
       Section 4.1, for both UDP and TCP.  The interaction between the
       base DOTS signal channel and the Call Home is discussed in
       Appendix A.

       The Happy Eyeballs mechanism explained in Section 4.3 of
       [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] is used for initiating (D)TLS
       connections.

   2.  Using this (D)TLS connection, the Call Home DOTS client may
       request, withdraw, or retrieve the status of mitigation requests.
       The Call Home DOTS client supplies the source information by
       means of new attributes defined in Section 3.3.1.

       The Heartbeat mechanism used for the DOTS Call Home deviates from
       the one defined in Section 4.7 of [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].
       Section 3.2.1 specifies the behavior to be followed by Call Home
       DOTS agents.

3.2.  DOTS Signal Channel Variations

3.2.1.  Heartbeat Mechanism

   Once the (D)TLS section is established between the DOTS agents, the
   Call Home DOTS client contacts the Call Home DOTS server to retrieve
   the session configuration parameters (Section 4.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel]).  The Call Home DOTS server adjusts
   the 'heartbeat-interval' to accommodate binding timers used by on-
   path NATs and firewalls.  Heartbeats will be then exchanged by the
   DOTS agents following the instructions retrieved using the signal
   channel session configuration exchange.

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


   It is the responsibility of Call Home DOTS servers to ensure that on-
   path translators/firewalls are maintaining a binding so that the same
   external IP address and/or port number is retained for the DOTS
   signal channel session.  A Call Home DOTS client MAY trigger their
   heartbeat requests immediately after receiving heartbeat probes from
   its peer Call Home DOTS server.

   When an outgoing attack that saturates the outgoing link from the
   Call Home DOTS server is detected and reported by a Call Home DOTS
   client, the latter MUST continue to use the DOTS signal channel even
   if no traffic is received from the Call Home DOTS server.

   If the Call Home DOTS server receives traffic from the Call Home DOTS
   client, the Call Home DOTS server MUST continue to use the DOTS
   signal channel even if the missing heartbeats allowed threshold
   ('missing-hb-allowed') is reached.

   If the Call Home DOTS server does not receive any traffic from the
   peer Call Home DOTS client during the time span required to exhaust
   the maximum 'missing-hb-allowed' threshold, the Call Home DOTS server
   concludes the session is disconnected.  Then, the Call Home DOTS
   server MUST try to resume the (D)TLS session.

3.2.2.  Redirected Signaling

   A Call Home DOTS server MUST NOT support the Redirected Signaling
   mechanism as specified in Section 4.6 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] (i.e., a 5.03 response that conveys an
   alternate DOTS server's FQDN or alternate DOTS server's IP
   address(es)).  A Call Home DOTS client MUST silently discard such
   message as only a Call Home DOTS server can initiate a new (D)TLS
   connection.

   If a Call Home DOTS client wants to redirect a Call Home DOTS server
   to another Call Home DOTS client, it MUST send a Non-confirmable PUT
   request to the predefined resource ".well-known/dots/redirect" with
   the new Call Home DOTS client FQDN or IP address in the body of the
   PUT similar to what is described in Section 4.6 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].  Furthermore, a new clause called
   'ttl" is defined to return the Time to live (TTL) of the alternate
   Call Home DOTS client.

   On receipt of this PUT request, the Call Home DOTS server responds
   with a 2.01 (Created), closes this connection and establishes a
   connection with the new Call Home DOTS client.  The processing of the
   TTL is defined in Section 4.6 of [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].  If
   the Call Home DOTS server cannot service the PUT request, the
   response is rejected with a 4.00 (bad Request).

3.3.  DOTS Signal Channel Extension

3.3.1.  Mitigation Request

   This specification extends the mitigation request defined in
   Section 4.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] to convey the attack
   source information (e.g., source prefixes, source port numbers).  The
   DOTS client conveys the following new parameters in the CBOR body of
   the mitigation request:

   source-prefix:  A list of attacker prefixes used to attack the
      target.  Prefixes are represented using Classless Inter-Domain
      Routing (CIDR) notation [RFC4632].

      As a reminder, the prefix length MUST be less than or equal to 32
      (or 128) for IPv4 (or IPv6).

      The prefix list MUST NOT include broadcast, loopback, or multicast
      addresses.  These addresses are considered as invalid values.  In
      addition, the DOTS client MUST validate that attacker prefixes are
      within the scope of the DOTS server domain.

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


      This is an optional attribute for the base DOTS signal channel
      operations.

   source-port-range:  A list of port numbers used by the attack traffic
      flows.

      A port range is defined by two bounds, a lower port number (lower-
      port) and an upper port number (upper-port).  When only 'lower-
      port' is present, it represents a single port number.

      For TCP, UDP, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
      [RFC4960], or Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
      [RFC4340], a range of ports can be any subrange of 0-65535, for
      example, 0-1023, 1024-65535, or 1024-49151.

      This is an optional attribute for the base DOTS signal channel
      operations.

   source-icmp-type-range:  A list of ICMP types used by the attack
      traffic flows.  An ICMP type range is defined by two bounds, a
      lower ICMP type (lower-type) and an upper ICMP type (upper-type).
      When only 'lower-type' is present, it represents a single ICMP
      type.

      This is an optional attribute for the base DOTS signal channel
      operations.

   The 'source-prefix' parameter is a mandatory attribute when the
   attack traffic information is signaled by a Call Home DOTS client
   (i.e., the Call Home scenario depicted in Figure 7).  The 'target-
   uri' or 'target-fqdn' parameters can be included in a mitigation
   request for diagnostic purposes to notify the Call Home DOTS server
   domain administrator, but SHOULD NOT be used to determine the target
   IP addresses.  Note that 'target-prefix' becomes a mandatory
   attribute in the mitigation request signaling the attack information
   because 'target-uri' and 'target-fqdn' are optional attributes and
   'alias-name' will not be conveyed in a mitigation request.

   In order to help attack source identification by a Call Home DOTS
   server, the Call Home DOTS client SHOULD include in its mitigation
   request additional information such as 'source-port-range' or
   'source-icmp-type-range'.  The Call Home DOTS client may not include
   such information if 'source-prefix' conveys an IPv6 address/prefix.
   Address sharing implications on the setting of source information
   ('source-prefix', 'source-port-range') are discussed in

   Only immediate mitigation requests (i.e., 'trigger-mitigation' set to
   'true') are allowed; Call Home DOTS clients MUST NOT send requests
   with 'trigger-mitigation' set to 'false'.  Such requests MUST be
   discarded by the Call Home DOTS server with a 4.00 (Bad Request).

   An example of a mitigation request sent by a Call Home DOTS client is
   shown in Figure 9.

   Figure 9: An Example of Mitigation Request Issued by a Call Home DOTS
                                  Client

   The Call Home DOTS server MUST check that the 'source-prefix' is
   within the scope of the Call Home DOTS server domain.  Note that in a
   DOTS Call Home scenario, the Call Home DOTS server considers, by
   default, that any routeable IP prefix enclosed in 'target-prefix' is
   within the scope of the Call Home DOTS client.  Invalid mitigation
   requests are handled as per Section 4.4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].

      Note: These validation checks do not apply when the source
      information is included as a hint in the context of the base DOTS
      signal channel.

   The Call Home DOTS server domain administrator consent MAY be
   required to block the traffic from the compromised device to the
   attack target.  An implementation MAY have a configuration knob to
   block the traffic from the compromised device to the attack target
   with or without DOTS server domain administrator consent.  If the
   attack traffic is blocked, the Call Home DOTS server informs the Call
   Home DOTS client that the attack is being mitigated.

   If the attack traffic information is identified by the Call Home DOTS
   server or the Call Home DOTS server domain administrator as
   legitimate traffic, the mitigation request is rejected, and 4.09
   (Conflict) is returned to the Call Home DOTS client.  The conflict-
   clause (defined in Section 4.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel])
   indicates the cause of the conflict.  The following new value is
   defined:

   4: Mitigation request rejected.  This code is returned by the DOTS
      server to indicate the attack traffic has been classified as
      legitimate traffic.

   Once the request is validated by the Call Home DOTS server,
   appropriate actions are enforced to block the attack traffic within
   the source network.  The Call Home DOTS client is informed about the
   progress of the attack mitigation following the rules in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].  For example, if the Call Home DOTS
   server is embedded in a CPE, it can program the packet processor to
   punt all the traffic from the compromised device to the target to
   slow path.  The CPE inspects the punted slow path traffic to detect
   and block the outgoing DDoS attack traffic or quarantine the device
   (e.g., using MAC level filtering) until it is remediated, and
   notifies the CPE administrator about the compromised device.

   The DOTS agents follow the same procedures specified in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] for managing a mitigation request.

3.3.2.  Address Sharing Considerations

   If a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN, including NAT64) is located between the
   DOTS client domain and DOTS server domain, communicating an external
   IP address in a mitigation request is likely to be discarded by the
   Call Home DOTS server because the external IP address is not visible
   locally to the Call Home DOTS server (see Figure 10).  The Call Home
   DOTS server is only aware of the internal IP addresses/prefixes bound
   to its domain.  Thus, the Call Home DOTS client MUST NOT include the
   external IP address and/or port number identifying the suspect attack
   source, but MUST include the internal IP address and/or port number.
   To that aim, the Call Home DOTS client SHOULD rely on mechanisms,
   such as [RFC8512] or [RFC8513], to retrieve the internal IP address

             Figure 10: Example of a CGN between DOTS Domains

   If a MAP Border Relay [RFC7597] or lwAFTR [RFC7596] is enabled in the
   provider's domain to service its customers, the identification of an
   attack source bound to an IPv4 address/prefix MUST also rely on
   source port numbers because the same IPv4 address is assigned to
   multiple customers.  The port information is required to
   unambiguously identify the source of an attack.

   If a translator is enabled on the boundaries of the domain hosting
   the Call Home DOTS server (e.g., a CPE with NAT enabled as shown in
   Figures 11 and 12), the Call Home DOTS server uses the attack traffic
   information conveyed in a mitigation request to find the internal
   source IP address of the compromised device and blocks the traffic
   from the compromised device traffic to the attack target until the

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  DOTS Signal Channel Call Home UDP and TCP Port Number

   IANA is requested to assign the port number TBD to the DOTS signal
   channel Call Home protocol for both UDP and TCP from the "Service
   Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" available at:
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-
   names-port-numbers.xhtml.

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


      Service Name:           dots-call-home
      Port Number:            TBD
      Transport Protocol(s):  TCP/UDP
      Description:            DOTS Signal Channel Call Home
      Assignee:               IESG <iesg@ietf.org>
      Contact:                IETF Chair <chair@ietf.org>
      Reference:              RFC XXXX

   The assignment of port number 4647 is strongly suggested (DOTS signal
   channel uses port number 4646).

4.2.  DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Mappings Registry

   This specification registers the 'source-prefix', 'source-port-
   range', and 'source-icmp-type-range' parameters in the IANA "DOTS
   Signal Channel CBOR Key Values" registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] (Figure 13).

   The 'source-prefix', 'source-port-range', and 'source-icmp-type-
   range' are comprehension-optional parameters.

   o  Note to the RFC Editor: Please delete (TBD1)-(TBD8) once CBOR keys
      are assigned from the 0x8000 - 0xBFFF range.

            Registrant Contact: The IESG.
            XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC7950] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry:

            name: ietf-dots-call-home
            namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-dots-call-home
            maintained by IANA: N
            prefix: call-home
            reference: RFC XXXX

5.  Security Considerations

   This document deviates from classic DOTS signal channel usage by
   having the DOTS server initiate the (D)TLS connection.  DOTS signal
   channel related security considerations discussed in Section 10 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] MUST be considered.  DOTS agents MUST
   authenticate each other using (D)TLS before a DOTS signal channel
   session is considered valid.

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


   An attacker may launch a DoS attack on the DOTS client by having it
   perform computationally expensive operations, before deducing that
   the attacker doesn't possess a valid key.  For instance, in TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446], the ServerHello message contains a Key Share value based
   on an expensive asymmetric key operation for key establishment.
   Common precautions mitigating DoS attacks are recommended, such as
   temporarily blacklisting the source address after a set number of
   unsuccessful authentication attempts.

   Call Home DOTS servers may not blindly trust mitigation requests from
   Call Home DOTS clients.  For example, DOTS servers can use the attack
   flow information in a mitigation request to enable full-fledged
   packet inspection function to inspect all the traffic from the
   compromised device to the target or to re-direct the traffic from the
   compromised device to the target to a DDoS mitigation system to scrub
   the suspicious traffic.  Call Home DOTS servers can also seek the
   consent of DOTS server domain administrator to block the traffic from
   the compromised device to the target (see Section 3.3.1).

6.  Privacy Considerations

   The considerations discussed in [RFC6973] were taken into account to
   assess whether the DOTS Call Home introduces privacy threats.

   Concretely, the protocol does not leak any new information that can
   be used to ease surveillance.  In particular, the Call Home DOTS
   server is not required to share information that is local to its
   network (e.g., internal identifiers of an attack source) with the
   Call Home DOTS client.

   The DOTS Call Home does not preclude the validation of mitigation
   requests received from a Call Home DOTS client.  For example, a
   security service running on the CPE may require administrator's
   consent before the CPE acts upon the mitigation request indicated by
   the Call Home DOTS client.  How the consent is obtained is out of
   scope of this document.

   Note that a Call Home DOTS server can seek for an administrator's
   consent, validate the request by inspecting the traffic, or proceed
   with both.

   The DOTS Call Home is only advisory in nature.  Concretely, the DOTS
   Call Home does not impose any action to be enforced within the
   network hosting an attack source; it is up to the Call Home DOTS
   server (and/or network administrator) to decide whether and which
   actions are required.

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


   Moreover, the DOTS Call Home avoids misattribution by appropriately
   identifying the network to which a suspect attack source belongs to
   (e.g., address sharing issues discussed in Section 3.3.1).

   Triggers to send a DOTS mitigation request to a Call Home DOTS server
   are deployment-specific.  For example, a Call Home DOTS client may
   rely on the output of some DDoS detection systems deployed within the
   DOTS client domain to detect potential outbound DDoS attacks or on
   abuse claims received from remote victim networks.  Such DDoS
   detection and mitigation techniques are not meant to track the
   activity of users, but to protect the Internet and avoid altering the
   IP reputation of the DOTS client domain.

Appendix A.  Disambiguate Base DOTS Signal vs. DOTS Call Home

   With the DOTS signal channel Call Home, there is a chance that two
   DOTS agents can simultaneously establish two DOTS signal channels
   with different directions (base DOTS signal channel and DOTS signal
   channel Call Home).  Here is one example drawn from the home network.
   Nevertheless, the outcome of the discussion is not specific to these
   networks, but applies to any DOTS Call Home scenario.

   In the Call Home scenario, the DOTS server in, for example, the home
   network can mitigate the DDoS attacks launched by the compromised
   device in its domain by receiving the mitigation request sent by the
   Call Home DOTS client in the ISP environment.  In addition, the DOTS
   client in the home network can initiate a mitigation request to the
   DOTS server in the ISP environment to ask for help when the home
   network is under a DDoS attack.  Such DOTS server and DOTS client in
   the home network can co-locate in the same home network element
   (e.g., the Customer Premises Equipment).  In this case, with the same
   peer at the same time the home network element will have the base
   DOTS signal channel and the DOTS signal channel Call Home defined in
   this specification.  Thus, these two signal channels need to be
   distinguished when they are both supported.  Two approaches have been
   considered for distinguishing the two DOTS signal channels, but only
   the one that using the dedicated port number has been chosen as the
   best choice.

   By using a dedicated port number for each, these two signal channels
   can be separated unambiguously and easily.  For example, the CPE uses
   the port number 4646 allocated in [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] to
   initiate the basic signal channel to the ISP when it acts as the DOTS
   client, and uses the port number TBD to initiate the signal channel
   Call Home.  Based on the different port numbers, the ISP can directly
   decide which kind of procedures should follow immediately after it
   receives the DOTS messages.  This approach just requires two (D)TLS
   sessions to be established respectively for the basic signal channel
   and signal channel Call Home.

Internet-Draft            DOTS Signal Call Home           September 2019


   The other approach is signaling the role of each DOTS agent (e.g., by
   using the DOTS data channel).  For example, the DOTS agent in the
   home network first initiates a DOTS data channel to the peer DOTS
   agent in the ISP environment, at this time the DOTS agent in the home
   network is the DOTS client and the peer DOTS agent in the ISP
   environment is the DOTS server.  After that, the DOTS agent in the
   home network retrieves the DOTS Call Home capability of the peer DOTS
   agent.  If the peer supports the DOTS Call Home, the DOTS agent needs
   to subscribe to the peer to use this extension.  Then, the reversal
   of DOTS role can be recognized as done by both DOTS agents.  When the
   DOTS agent in the ISP environment, which now is the DOTS client,
   wants to filter the attackers' traffic, it requests the DOTS agent in
   the home network, which now is the DOTS server, for help.

   Signaling the role will complicate the DOTS protocol, and this
   complexity is not required in context where the DOTS Call Home is not
   required or only when the DOTS Call Home is needed.  Besides, the
   DOTS data channel may not work during attack time.  Even if changing
   the above example from using the DOTS data channel to the DOTS signal
   channel, the more procedures will still reduce the efficiency.  Using
   the dedicated port number is much easier and more concise compared to
   the second approach, and its cost that establishing two (D)TLS
   sessions is much less.  So, using a dedicated port number for the
   DOTS Call Home is chosen in this specification.
