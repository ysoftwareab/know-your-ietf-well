y = F(X)
       An element-to-scalar mapping function.  For an elliptic curve
       group, it takes a point on the curve and returns the
       x-coordinate; for a finite field element, it is the identity
       function, just returning the element itself.

Z = DH(x,Y)
       For an elliptic curve, DH(x,Y) is the multiplication of point Y
       by the scalar value x, creating a point on the curve Z; for
       finite field cryptography, DH(x,Y) is an exponentiation of
       element Y to the power of x (implied modulo a field defining
       prime, p) resulting in an element Z.

a = len(b)
       Indicates the length in bits of the string b.

z = F(DH(x, Y))
