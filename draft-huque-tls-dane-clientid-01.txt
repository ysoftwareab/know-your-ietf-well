1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension
   [RFC6066] to convey a DANE [RFC6698] Client Identity to the TLS
   server.  This is useful for applications that perform TLS client
   authentication via DANE TLSA records, as described in [DANECLIENT].
   The conveyed identity is in the form of a domain name associated with
   the client that is expected to have a corresponding DANE TLSA record
   published in the DNS.

   This extension supports both TLS and DTLS [RFC6347], and the term TLS
   in this document is used generically to describe both protocols.

2.  Overview

   When TLS clients use X.509 client certificates or raw public keys
   that are authenticated via DANE TLSA records, they need a mechanism
   to convey their DANE identity to the server.  The TLS extension
   defined in this document is used to accomplish this.  Upon receipt of
   this extension, a TLS server learns the client's identity and the
   fact that the client expects that the server can authenticate it via
   a corresponding DNSSEC-validated TLSA record.

Internet-Draft         TLS DANE ClientID Extension         February 2017


   In the case of X.509 client certificates, a TLS server can learn the
   client's identity by examining subject alternative names included in
   the certificate itself.  However, without a mechanism such as the one
   defined in this extension, the TLS server cannot know apriori that
   the client has a published TLSA record, and thus may unnecessarily
   issue DNS queries for DANE TLSA records in-band with the TLS
   handshake even in cases where the client has no TLSA record
   associated with it.  When multiple identities are present in the
   certificate, a client can use this extension to specify exactly which
   one the server should use.  An additional situation in which this
   extension helps is where some TLS servers may need to selectively
   prompt for client certificate credentials only for clients that are
   equipped to provide certificates.

   When TLS raw public keys [RFC7250] are being used to authenticate the
   client, the client uses this extension to explicitly indicate to the
   server what its domain name identity is.

   Detailed protocol behavior of TLS clients and servers is described in
   [DANECLIENT].

3.  DANE Client Identity Extension

   The DANE Client Identity Extension type, "dane_clientid", will have a
   value assigned and registered in the IANA TLS Extensions registry.

   A TLS client implementing this specification SHOULD send an extension
   of type "dane_clientid" in the ClientHello handshake message to TLS
   servers it intends to perform DANE client authentication with.

   The "extension_data" field of the extension MUST contain a
   "DaneClientName" data structure defined in the following format:

   enum {
       dns_name(0), srv_name(1), (255)
   } NameType;

   opaque dNSName<1..2^16-1>;
   opaque SRVName<1..2^16-1>;

   struct {
       NameType name_type;
       select (name_type) {
           case dns_name: dNSName;
           case srv_name: SRVName;
       } name;
   } DaneClientName;


   The opaque dNSName or SRVName field contains the domain name of the
   client in textual presentation format, as described in RFC 1035
   [RFC1035].

4.  Open Questions

   Should multiple client names be supported in the extension?

   Is the dNSName/SRVName distinction useful, or can we just simplify
   and use only dNSName?  These two name forms are analogous to the two
   recommended for use in X.509 certificates in the DANE client
   authentication draft, so the server could use this to additionally
   check against the corresponding certificate fields (but does it need
   to?).  If the server needs a hint of whether to construct an
   application specific ID, then this might be useful, but this could
   also be inferred from the structure of the name and the client could
   just specify an application specific identity in the dNSName type.

   The extension is defined in terms of a DANE specific identity.  Is
   there a need for a more general purpose client name indication
   extension?  If so, this extension could be renamed and augmented to
   have an additional usage field containing values denoting DANE or
   alternative application usages.

5.  Security Considerations

   To prevent unnecessary privacy leakage of the client's name in
   cleartext, a TLS client implementing this specification should be
   configured to only send this extension to TLS servers it intends to
   perform client authentication with.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This extension requires the registration of a new value in the TLS
   ExtensionsType registry.  If the draft is adopted by the WG, the
   authors expect to make an early allocation request as specified in
   [RFC7120]
