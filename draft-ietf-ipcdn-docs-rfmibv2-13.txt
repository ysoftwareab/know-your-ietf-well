Internet-Draft    DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB     February 2005


1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over
   Cable Service Interface Specification process.

2.1  Baseline Privacy

   Security interface specification designed for DOCSIS compliant cable
   data systems that ensures device authentication data confidentiality
   in the CATV plant.  See [BPI] and [BPIPLUS].

2.2  CATV

   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals
   to a community.

2.3  Channel

   A specific frequency allocation with an RF medium, specified by
   channel width in Hertz (cycles per second) and by center frequency.
   Within the US Cable Systems, upstream channels are generally
   allocated from the 5-42MHz range while down stream channels are
   generally allocated from the 50-750MHz range depending on the
   capabilities of the given system.  The typical broadcast channel
   width in the US is 6MHz.  Upstream channel widths for DOCSIS vary.

   For European cable systems, upstream channels vary by country.  The
   upper edge of upstream channel allocations vary between 25 MHz to 65
   MHz, and the lower edge of downstream channel allocations vary
   between 47 MHz and 87.5 MHz.  The typical broadcast channel width in
   Europe is 8MHz.  The actual parameters are of concern to systems
   deploying Euro-DOCSIS technology.

2.4  CM or Cable Modem

   A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data
   system.

2.5  CMTS or Cable Modem Termination System

   A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head-end.
   A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data
   system.  It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it
   controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated
   CMs.

   The term DOCSIS 1.x is used in this document to refer both DOCSIS 1.0
   and DOCSIS 1.1.

2.9.3  DOCSIS 2.0

   Cable modem systems CM/CMTS compliant to requirements in [ITU-T
   J.122].  DOCSIS 2.0 corresponds to the second generation of

3.  Overview

   This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management
   of DOCSIS compliant Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination
   Systems (CMTS) RF interfaces.  The specification is derived in part
   from the parameters and protocols described in [ITU-T J.122].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.1  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB module is structured as three groups:
   o  Management information pertinent to both Cable Modems (CM) and
      Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS) (docsIfBaseObjects).
   o  Management information pertinent to Cable Modems only
      (docsIfCmObjects).
   o  Management information pertinent to Cable Modem Termination
      Systems only (docsIfCmtsObjects).

   Tables within each of these groups group objects functionally - e.g.
   Quality of Service, Channel characteristics, MAC layer management,
   etc.  Rows created automatically (e.g.  by the device according to
   the hardware configuration) may and generally will have a mixture of
   configuration and status objects within them.  Rows that are meant to
   be created by the management station are generally restricted to
   configuration (read-create) objects.

3.1.1  docsIfBaseObjects

   docsIfDownstreamChannelTable - This table describes the existing
   downstream channels for a CMTS and the received downstream channel
   for a CM.

   docsIfUpstreamChannelTable - This table describes the existing
   upstream channels for a CMTS and the current upstream transmission
   channel for a CM.

   docsIfQosProfileTable - This table describes the valid Quality of
   Service profiles for the cable data system.

   docsIfSignalQualityTable - This table is used to monitor RF signal
   quality characteristics of received signals.

   docsIfDocsisBaseCapability  - This object is used to indicate the
   highest level of DOCSIS version a cable device can support.

Internet-Draft    DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB     February 2005


3.1.2  docsIfCmObjects

   docsIfCmMacTable - This table is used to monitor the DOCSIS MAC
   interface and can be considered an extension to the ifEntry.

   docsIfCmStatusTable - This table maintains a number of status objects
   and counters for cable modems.  There is a comparable table at the
   CMTS, docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable, which maintains similar counters from
   the CMTS point of view.

   docsIfCmServiceTable - This table describes the upstream service
   queues available at this CM.  There is a comparable table at the
   CMTS, docsIfCmtsServiceEntry, which describes the service queues from
   the point of view of the CMTS.

3.1.3  docsifcmtsobjects

   docsIfCmtsMacTable - Describes the attributes of each CMTS MAC
   interface.

   docsIfCmtsStatusTable - This table provides a set of aggregated
   counters which roll-up values and events that occur on the underlying
   sub-interfaces.

   docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable - This table is used to hold information
   about known (i.e.  ranging, registered, and/or previously online)
   cable modems on the system serviced by this CMTS.

   docsIfCmtsServiceTable - This table provides access to the
   information related to upstream service queues.

   docsIfCmtsModulationTable - This table allows control over the
   modulation profiles for RF channels associated with this CMTS.

   docsIfCmtsMacToCmTable - This table allows fast access into the
   docsIfCmtsCmTable via a MAC address (of the CM) interface.

   docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationTable - This table provides statistical
   load usage data for attached upstream and downstream physical
   channels.

   docsIfCmtsDownChannelCounterTable - This table provides statistical
   data for attached downstream channels, appropriate as input for load
   usage calculations.

   docsIfCmtsUpChannelCounterTable - This table provides statistical
   data for attached upstream channels, appropriate as input for load
   usage calculations.

3.1.4  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB module

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB module to the
   Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  Several areas of correlation are Addressed
   in the following subsections.  The implementer is referred to the
   Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general intent of
   these areas.

3.1.4.1  Layering Model

   An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF Downstream interface, for
   each RF Upstream interface, for each Upstream logical Channel and for
   each RF MAC layer.

   The ifStackTable [RFC2863] MUST be implemented to identify the
   relationships among sub-interfaces.

   The following example illustrates a CMTS MAC interface with one
   downstream and two upstream interfaces.

                                Figure 1

   As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on
   top of the downstream and upstream interfaces, and the RF Upstream
   interface is layered on top of an Upstream Logical Channels.

   In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows:

   The same interface model can also be used in Telephony or Telco
   Return systems.  A pure Telco Return system (Cable Modem as well as
   Cable Modem Termination System) would not have upstream, but only
   downstream cable channels.  Systems supporting both Telco Return and
   cable upstream channels can use the above model without modification.

   Telco Return Upstream channel(s) management is outside the scope of
   this document.

        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
            "This object is generally intended to be used for the
             creation of a temporary upstream row for the purpose
             of adjusting channel parameters of a physical upstream
             channel row.

             The following restrictions apply to this object:
             1. Entries with this object set to active(1) are
                extensions of defined physical interfaces in the
                interface MIB RFC 2863. Entries created by
                RowStatus createandWait(5) are referred as temporary
                inactive rows used to
                clone parameters.
             2. A status transition from active(1) to notInService(2)
                or destroy(6) is not permitted.
             3. ifAdminStatus from the Interface MIB RFC 2863 is used
                to take an Upstream Channel offline.
             4. Temporary inactive rows MUST be created using
                createAndWait(5).
             5. The only possible status change of a row created using
                createAndWait(5) (i.e. notInService(2)) or notReady(3)
                is to destroy(6).
             6. Temporary created rows MUST never be given the status
                active(1).

             A mandatory procedure for adjusting an specific physical
             Upstream channel is:
             1. Create a temporary row through an SNMP SET using
                createAndWait(5).  Use an ifIndex value outside the
                operational range of the system.
             2. Set the docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom field to the ifIndex
                value of the physical row whose parameters require
                adjustment.
             3. Adjust the parameter values using the new temporary
                row.  Ensure all parameters contain desired values
                before proceeding to step 4.
             4. Update the physical row by setting the object
                docsIfUpChannelUpdate to true(1).
             5. Delete the temporary row through an SNMP SET using
                destroy(6).
                Temporary entries MUST NOT persist at reinitialization
                of the managed system."

             The upstream channel utilization index is expressed as a
             percentage of mini-slots utilized on the physical channel,
             regardless of burst type.  For an Initial Maintenance
             region, the mini-slots for the complete region are
             considered utilized if the CMTS received an upstream
             burst within the region from any CM on the physical
             channel.  For contention REQ and REQ/DATA regions, the
             mini-slots for a transmission opportunity within the
             region are considered utilized if the CMTS received an
             upstream burst within the opportunity from any CM on the
             physical channel.  For all other regions, utilized
             mini-slots are those in which the CMTS granted
             bandwidth to any unicast SID on the physical channel.

             For an upstream interface that has multiple logical
             upstream channels enabled, the utilization index is a
             weighted sum of utilization indices for the logical
             channels.  The weight for each utilization index is the
             percentage of upstream mini-slots allocated for the
             corresponding logical channel.
             Example:
             If 75% of bandwidth is allocated to the first logical
             channel and 25% to the second, and the utilization
             indices for each are 60 and 40 respectively, the
             utilization index for the upstream physical channel is
             (60 * 0.75) + (40 * 0.25) = 55.  This figure
             applies to the most recent utilization interval.

             Downstream Channel Utilization Index:
             The downstream channel utilization index is a percentage
             expressing the ratio between bytes used to transmit data
             versus the total number of bytes transmitted in the raw
             bandwidth of the MPEG channel.  As with the upstream
             utilization index, the calculated value represents
             the most recent utilization interval.
             Formula:
             Downstream utilization index =
             (100 * (data bytes / raw bytes))

             Definitions:
             Data bytes:    Number of bytes transmitted as data in the
                            docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationInterval.

                            Bytes measured over the utilization
                            interval.
             Raw bandwidth: Total number of bytes available for
                            transmitting data, not including bytes
                            used for headers and other overhead.

6.  Revision History

6.1  Scope

   The MIB module in this document has been developed to accommodate
   DOCSIS 2.0 devices and their system capabilities.  The MIB module is
   an update to RFC 2670 [RFC2670] with the additional incorporation of
   DOCSIS and Euro-DOCSIS specification requirements.

6.2  Extension

   We have maintained the MIB objects as defined in RFC 2670 [RFC2670].
   In some cases new MIB objects have been created with identical
   functionality but greater capacity (i.e.  32 to 64 bits).  In these
   situations, both the original 32 bit objects and the new 64 bit
   objects must be implemented.

6.3  Changes from RFC 2670

   o  Upstream now separated into 'physical interfaces' and 'logical
      channels'.  An instance of the docsIfUpstreamChannelTable exists
      for each 'logical channel'.  The IANA ifType for 'logical
      channels' is 205.  The IANA ifType for 'physical interfaces'
      remains at 129.
   o  Object docsIfDownChannelAnnex added to
      docsIfDownstreamChannelTable.  This object originated in the
      Euro-DOCSIS specifications.
   o  Nine new objects added to the docsIfUpstreamChannelTable.  One
      describes the channel type in use.  Four are specific S-CDMA
      parameters.  Three are used in the creation of a temporary
      inactive upstream row so the channel parameters may be manipulated
      'offline'.
   o  One object has been added to enable/disable pre-equalization on
      the upstream channel.
   o  Object docsIfQosProfMaxTransmitBurst has been added to the
      docsIfQosProfileTable to replace deprecated object
      docsIfQosProfMaxTxBurst.  This fixes a range error caused by
      switch to recording as bytes instead of mini-slots.
   o  Three new 64 bit counters added to the docsIfSignalQualityTable to
      extend the capacity of existing 32 bit counters.
   o  A new base object docsIfDocsisBaseCapability has been added which
      mirrors the functionality of the DOCSIS specification [OSSI2.0]
      defined MIB object docsIfDocsisCapability, extended to include
      DOCSIS 2.0.
   o  Five new objects added to the docsIfCmStatusTable.  One indicates
      the current modulation type.  The second mirrors the functionality
      of the DOCSIS specification [OSSI2.0] defined MIB object
      docsIfDocsisOperMode, while clarifying that it applies to the

      COS/QOS mode used by the device.  The third new object indicates
      equalization data at the CM.  Last two objects indicates total and
      failed UCC transactions.
   o  Two new 64 bit counters added to the docsIfCmServiceTable to
      extend the capacity of existing 32 bit counters.
   o  Nine new objects added to the docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable.  Three are
      64 bit counters, two add ipv6 capability, one indicates the CM
      modulation type in use, one indicates the last update time for the
      status value, one is a high resolution of the timing offset MIB
      object.
   o  The remaining object mirrors the functionality of the DOCSIS
      specification [OSSI2.0] defined MIB object
      docsIfCmtsCmStatusDocsisMode, while clarifying that it applies to
      the COS/QOS mode used by the device.
   o  One object added to the docsIfCmtsServiceTable to fix a range
      error in an existing object, that has been deprecated.
   o  Eight new objects added to the docsIfCmtsModulationTable.  Seven
      of these describe ATDMA/S-CDMA channel parameters, while the other
      describes modulation attributes common to all modulation types.
   o  One new object and three new tables added to provide CMTS upstream
      and downstream channel utilization data.
   o  Enumerated values for object docsIfDownChannelInterleave have been
      expanded to include a Euro-DOCSIS value.
   o  Enumerated values for object docsIfCmtsModIntervalUsageCode have
      been expanded to include new DOCSIS 2.0 values.
   o  Enumerated values for object docsIfCmtsModType have been expanded
      to include new DOCSIS 2.0 values.
   o  Compliance statements have been updated to reflect new objects and
      to describe Euro-DOCSIS specific implementation features.
   o  The descriptions of objects docsIfCmtsStatusInvalidRegReqs and
      docsIfCmtsStatusFailedRegReqs have been clarified.
   o  Separated references into normative and informative.
   o  One object added to the docsIfCmtsModulationTable to indicate
      storage type of the table entries to differentiate factory and
      user configuration.
   o  General persistence statements for read-create and read-write
      objects.
   o  Updated DESCRIPTION and UNITS clauses for object
      docsIfSigQMicroreflections.
   o  Corrected DESCRIPTION clause of object docsIfCmStatusValue.
   o  Updated IPR Notice and Disclosure to RFC 3667 section 5.1 and RFC
      3668 as well as Copyright to RFC 3667 sections 5.4 and 5.5.

7.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module relates to a system which will provide metropolitan
   public internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the MIB
   objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of
   service to a large number of end-users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   In the CM case the only read-write object is docsIfCmRangingTimeout,
   which if maliciously SET may not constitute a critical factor of the
   service degradation.

   The rest of the CM required MIB objects in this MIB module are
   read-only by the MIB definitions or by CM compliance statements, the
   majority of those MIB objects are controlled by the CMTS.  Therefore,
   write access to the CMTS MIB objects may compromise the services
   offering as defined below.

   The CMTS is the controller of most of the parameters of the DOCSIS
   RFI Interface, These are the tables and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:
   o  Objects in the docsIfBasicGroupv2 if SET maliciously by an
      attacker could result in a denial of service either by service
      disruption or degradation.  Particularly SETs in objects of tables
      docsIfDownstreamChannelTable, docsIfUpstreamChannelTable,
      docsIfCmtsModulationTable and docsIfQosProfileTable (the last one
      in conjunction with MIB object docsIfCmtsQosProfilePermissions)
      can alter negatively the physical and link layers parameters for
      upstream and downstream channels.
   o  The Object docsIfCmtsServiceAdminStatus of the docsIfCmtsGroupv2
      group when SET maliciously by an attacker to 'destroyed' could
      interrupt temporarily a cable modem service by removing its entry
      in docsifCmtsServiceTable.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

Internet-Draft    DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB     February 2005


   o  Read access to the MIB objects in tables docsIfCmStatusTable (CM),
      docsIfSignalQualityTable (CM/CMTS) and mainly CMTS tables
      docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable, docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationTable,
      docsIfCmtsDownChannelCounterTable and
      docsIfCmtsUpChannelCounterTable as well as all the tables
      described above, could reveal information about the cable modems
      distribution among the upstream and downstream channels and their
      performance which could be used to gain access to a different
      tiered service offer.  The table docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable also
      contain the MAC and IP addresses of the cable modems that cam be
      used of theft of service and IP spoofing.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see  [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Management Interoperability of DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0

   The MIB module contained in this document updates RFC 2670 [RFC2670],
   primarily to handle the management requirements of the DOCSIS RF
   Interface of DOCSIS 2.0 [ITU-T J.122].  RFC 2670 contains the DOCSIS
   RF Interface management requirements for DOCSIS 1.0 and DOCSIS 1.1.

   The management requirements of Class of Service (DOCSIS 1.0) pertain
   to RFC 2670 are the same as this document update and are contained in
   tables docsIfQosProfileTable, docsIfCmServiceTable and
   docsIfCmtsServiceTable.

   DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 2.0 Quality of Service management requirements
   are defined in the DOCSIS management specifications [OSSI1.1] and
   [OSSI2.0] respectively.
