1. Introduction

   Real time communications over IP networks use SIP for signaling with
   RTP/RTCP for media transport and reporting respectively. These
   protocols are very flexible and can support an extremely wide
   spectrum of usage scenarios. For this reason, extensions to these
   protocols must be specified in the context of a specific usage
   scenario. In this memo, extensions to SIP are proposed to support the
   reporting of RTCP XR VoIP metrics (RFC3611[4]).

1.1. Usage Scenarios

   The usage scenarios addressed in this memo are situations where a SIP
   user agent can easily report the voice quality since it communicates
   with a small number of other endpoints:

   1. Point-to-point VoIP conversations. These can include small
      telephony type multiparty scenarios, such as when using call
      transfer.

   2. Conference calls using a central conferencing server when each
      SIP can report on the quality of their leg to the central
      conferencing server.

   3. Multicast VoIP calls using source specific multicast (SSM). This
      is somewhat similar to the central conferencing scenario.

   Distributed conferences with audio mixing in the endpoints may
   require reporting on too many call legs and may be therefore less
   practical if there are more than 3-4 participants.

   The usage scenarios 1, 2, and 3 provide voice quality reports that
   are most closely related to the user experience, since the reporting
   application resides in the endpoints, such as in SIP UAs (UA). Many
   SIP UAs however may have limitations as to the footprint of the
   software and as a result frugal reporting capabilities are
   preferable.

   RTCP reports are usually sent to other participating endpoints in a
   session which can make collection of performance information by
   administration or management systems more complex. In the usage
   scenarios addressed in this memo, the data contained in RTCP XR VoIP
   metrics reports (RFC3611[4]) are forwarded to central collection
   server systems using SIP.

   Applications residing in the server or elsewhere can aid in network
   management to alleviate bandwidth constraints and also to support
   customer service by identifying and acknowledging calls of poor
   quality. Specifying such applications are however beyond the scope
   of this paper.

   Keeping it Simple

   There are a large portfolio of quality parameters that can be
   associated with VoIP, but only a minimal necessary number of
   parameters are included on the RTCP-XR reports:

       1. The codec type, as resulting from the SDP offer-answer
          negotiation in SIP,

       2. The burst gap loss density and max gap duration, since voice 
          cut-outs are the most annoying quality impairment in VoIP,

       3. Round trip delay because it is critical to conversational

Pendleton                                                      [Page  3]

draft-ietf-sipping-rtcp-summary-04.txt                     July 29, 2008

          quality,

       4. Conversational quality as a catch-all for other voice quality
          impairments, such as random distributed packet loss, jitter,
          annoying silent suppression effects, etc.
       
   In specific usage scenarios where other parameters are required,
   designers can include other parameters beyond the scope of this
   paper.

   RTCP reports are best effort only, and though very useful have a
   number of limitations as discussed in [3]. This must be considered
   when using RTCP reports in managed networks.

   This document defines a new SIP event package, vq-rtcpxr, and a new
   MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr, that enable the collection and
   reporting of metrics that measure quality for RTP [3] sessions. The
   definitions of the metrics used in the event package are based on
   RTCP Extended Reports [4] and RTCP [3]; a mapping between the SIP
   event parameters and the parameters within the forementioned RFC's
   is defined within this document in section 4.6.2.

   Monitoring of voice quality is believed to be the highest priority
   for usage of this mechanism and as such, the metrics in the event
   package are largely tailored for voice quality measurements. The
   event package is designed to be extensible. However the negotiation
   of such extensions is not defined in this document.

   The event package supports reporting both the voice quality metrics
   for both inbound and outbound directions.  Voice quality metrics for
   the inbound direction can generally be computed locally by the
   reporting endpoint however voice quality metrics for the outbound
   direction are computed by the remote endpoint and sent to the
   reporting endpoint using the RTCP Extended Reports [4].

   Configuration of usage of the event package is not covered in this
   document. It is the recommendation of this document that the SIP
   configuration framework [8] be used.  The authors have defined a
   configuration dataset that would facilitate this support in section
   5.8.

   The event package SHOULD be used with the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY method
   however MAY be used with the PUBLISH method for backward
   compatibility with some existing implementations. Message flow
   examples for both methods are provided in this document.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [1].

3. SIP Events for Voice over IP Performance Reporting

      This document defines a SIP events package [5] for Voice over IP
   performance reporting. A SIP UA can send these events to an entity
   which can make the information available to other applications. For
   purposes of illustration, the entities involved in SIP vq-rtcpxr
   event reporting will be referred to as follows:

   o REPORTER is an entity involved in the measurement and reporting
     of media quality i.e. the SIP UA involved in a media session.

   o COLLECTOR is an entity that receives SIP vq-rtcpxr events. A
     COLLECTOR may be a proxy server or another entity that is capable
     of supporting SIP vq-rtcpxr events.

3.1. SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY method 

   The REPORTER SHOULD send the voice quality metric reports using the
   NOTIFY method.  The COLLECTOR SHALL send a SUBSCRIBE to the REPORTER
   to explicitly establish the relationship. Configuration of an Address
   of Resource (AOR) of the COLLECTOR is not needed.

   The REPORTER MUST NOT send any vq-rtcpxr events if a COLLECTOR AOR
   has not been configured.

   The REPORTER SHALL populate the Request-URI of the NOTIFY method
   with the address of the resource (AOR) of the COLLECTOR.

   The COLLECTOR MAY send a SUBSCRIBE to a SIP Proxy acting on behalf
   ofthe reporting SIP UA's.

3.2. PUBLISH method

   A SIP UA that supports this specification MAY also send the service
   quality metric reports using the PUBLISH method, however this
   approach SHOULD NOT be used in unmanaged Internet services. The
   Publish method MAY be supported for backward compatibility with
   existing implementations.

   The REPORTER MAY therefore populate the Request-URI of the PUBLISH
   method with the AOR of the COLLECTOR. To ensure security of SIP
   proxies and the COLLECTOR, the REPORTER must be configured with the
   AOR of the COLLECTOR, preferably using the SIP UA configuration
   framework [8], as described in section 5.8.

   It is recommended that the REPORTER send an OPTIONS message to the
   COLLECTOR to ensure support of the PUBLISH message.

3.3. Multi-Party and Multi-Segment Calls

   A voice quality metric report may be sent for each session
   terminating at the REPORTER and may contain multiple report bodies.
   For a multi-party call the report MAY contain report bodies for the

Pendleton                                                      [Page  5]

draft-ietf-sipping-rtcp-summary-04.txt                     July 29, 2008

   session between the reporting endpoint and each remote endpoint for
   which there was an RTP session during the call.

   Supplementary services such as call hold and call transfer can result
   in the user participating in a series of concatenated sessions,
   potentially with different choices of codec or sample rate, although
   these may be perceived by the user as a single call.  A REPORTER MAY
   send a voice quality metric report at the end of each session or MAY
   send a single voice quality metric report containing a report body
   for each segment of the call.

3.4. Overload Avoidance

   To avoid overload of SIP Proxies or COLLECTORS it is important to do
   capacity planning and to minimize the number of reports that are
   sent.

      Approaches to avoiding overload include:

      a. Send only one report at the end of each call

      b. Use interval reports only on "problem" calls that are being
        closely monitored

   Limit the number of alerts that can be sent to a maximum of one per
   call

   Additionally, it is recommended that COLLECTORS that receive these
   reports use the 503 ''Service Unavailable'' error response code to
   limit unwanted reports and include the Retry-after header with an
   appropriate time delay, depending on the needs of the COLLECTOR.

4. Event Package Formal Definition

4.1. Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [5].

4.2. Event Package Parameters

   No event package parameters are defined.

4.3. SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   No SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.

4.4. Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

4.5. NOTIFY and PUBLISH Bodies

Pendleton                                                      [Page  6]

draft-ietf-sipping-rtcp-summary-04.txt                     July 29, 2008


   There are three notify bodies: a session report, an interval session
   report, and a alert report.

   The session report is used for end of session reporting. This can be
   generated when a voice media session terminates or when a media
   change occurs, such as a codec change or a session forks. This report
   is intended to allow cumulative metric reporting. The session reports
   will populate the metrics with values that are measured over the
   interval explicitly defined by the "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   The interval report is used for periodic or interval reporting. This
   report is intended to capture short duration metric reporting.
   Interval reports will populate the metrics with values that are
   measured over the interval explicitly defined by the "start" and
   "stop" timestamps.

   The alert report is used when voice quality degrades during a
   session.  The session report parameters are also included in the
   alert report to provide all of the necessary diagnostic information.
   Like the interval report, the metrics in the alert reports will be
   populated with values that are measured over the interval explicitly
   defined by the "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   This specification defines a new MIME type application/vq-rtcpxr
   which is a text encoding of the RTCP and RTCP-XR statistics, along
   with some additional metrics and correlation information.

4.6. Voice Quality Event Syntax and Semantics

   This section describes the syntax extensions required for event
   publication in SIP. The formal syntax definitions described in this
   section are expressed in the Augmented BNF [6] format used in SIP
   [2], and contains references to elements defined therein.
   Additionally, the definition of the timestamp format is provided in
   [7]. Note that most of the parameters are optional. In practice, most
   implementations will send a subset of the parameters. It is not the
   intention of this document to define what parameters may or may not
   be useful for monitoring the quality of a voice session, but to
   enable reporting of voice quality.  As such, the syntax allows the
   implementer to choose which metrics are most appropriate for their
   solution.  As there are no "invalid", "unknown", or "not applicable"
   values in the syntax, the intention is to exclude any parameters for
   which values are not available, not applicable, or unknown.

   Additionally, the authors recognize that implementers may need to add
   new parameter lines to the reports and new metrics to the existing
   parameter lines. The extension tokens are intended to fulfill this
   need.

draft-ietf-sipping-rtcp-summary-04.txt                     July 29, 2008

   RFC3611 uses an 8 bit, fixed point number with the binary point at 
   the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by dividing
   the total number of packets lost by the total number of packets
   expected and multiplying the result by 256, and taking the integer
   part. 

   For any RTCP XR parameter in this format, to map into the equivalent 
   SIP vq-rtcpxr parameter, simply reverse the equation i.e. divide by 
   256 and taking the integer part.  
 
4.6.2.2. Timestamps  

   Following SIP and other IETF convention, timestamps are provided in 
   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using the ABNF format provided in 
   IETF RFC3339 [7]. These timestamps should reflect, as closely 
   as possible, the actual time during which the media session was 
   running to enable correlation to related events occurring in the 
   network and to accounting or billing records.     

4.6.2.3. SessionDescription 

   The parameters in this field provide a shortened version of the 
   session SDP(s), containing only the relevant parameters for session 
   quality reporting purposes. 

      Payload Type 

   This is the "payload type" parameter used in the RTP packets i.e. the
   codec. This field can also be mapped from the SDP "rtpmap" attribute 
   field "payload type". IANA registered types SHOULD be used.     

      Payload Desc 

   This parameter provides a text name for the codec used in this 
   session.  

      Sample Rate 

   This parameter is mapped from the SDP "rtpmap"  attribute field 
   "clock rate". The field provides the rate at which voice was sampled,
   measured in Hertz (Hz).    

      Frame Duration 

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be 
   obtained from the device codec. The field reflects the amount of 
   voice content in each frame within the RTP payload, measured in 
   milliseconds. Note this value can be combined with the 
   FramesPerPacket to determine the packetization rate.      

      Frame Octets  

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but is usually provided

draft-ietf-sipping-rtcp-summary-04.txt                     July 29, 2008

   by the device codec. The field provides the number of octets in each
   frame within the RTP payload. This field is usually not provided when
   FrameDuration is provided.

      Frames Per Packet 

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be 
   obtained from the device codec.  This field provides the number of 
   frames in each RTP packet. Note this value can be combined with the 
   FrameDuration to determine the packetization rate. 

      Packets Per Second 

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be 
   obtained from the device codec. Packets per second provides the 
   number of RTP packets that are transmitted per second. 

      FMTP  

   This parameter is taken directly from the SDP attribute "fmtp".   

      Silence Suppression State  

   This parameter does not correspond to SDP, RTP, or RTCP XR. It 
   indicates whether silence suppression, also known as Voice Activity 
   Detection (VAD) is enabled for the identified session. 

      Packet Loss Concealment 

   This value corresponds to "PLC" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics Report
   Block. The values defined by RFC3611 are reused by this 
   recommendation and therefore no mapping is required. 

4.6.2.4. LocalAddr 

   This field provides the IP address, port and synchronization source 
   (SSRC) for the session from the perspective of the endpoint that is 
   sending the event.  The IPAddress can be IPv4 or IPv6 format. The 
   SSRC is taken from SDP, RTCP, or RTCP XR input paramters. 

   In the presence of NAT, the MAPPED-ADDRESS as reported by the STUN
   [9] server (RFC 3489) MUST be reported, since the internal IP address
   is not visible to the network operator.

4.6.2.5. RemoteAddr 

   This field provides the IP address, port and ssrc of the session peer
   from the perspective of the remote endpoint sending the event. In the
   presence of NAT, the MAPPED-ADDRESS as reported by the STUN [9]
   server (RFC 3489bis) MUST be reported, since the internal IP address
   is not visible to the network operator. 

4.6.2.6. Jitter Buffer Parameters

draft-ietf-sipping-rtcp-summary-04.txt                     July 29, 2008


      Jitter Buffer Adaptive  

   This value corresponds to "JBA" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics Report
   Block. The values defined by RFC3611 are reused by this ecommendation
   and therefore no mapping is required.

      Jitter Buffer Rate       

   This value corresponds to "JB rate" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block. The parameter does not require any mapping alculations.

      Jitter Buffer Nominal 

   This value corresponds to "JB nominal" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block. The parameter does not require any mapping
   calculations.

      Jitter Buffer Max 

   This value corresponds to "JB maximum" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block. The parameter does not require any conversion.

      Jitter Buffer Abs Max    

   This value corresponds to "JB abs max" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block. The parameter does not require any conversion.

4.6.2.7. Packet Loss Parameters  

      Network Packet Loss Rate  

   This value corresponds to "loss rate" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block. For conversion, see "General mapping percentages from 8
   bit, fixed point numbers".

      Jitter Buffer Discard Rate 

   This value corresponds to "discard rate" in RFC3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  For conversion, see "General mapping
   percentages from 8 bit, fixed point numbers".

4.6.2.8. Burst/Gap Parameters 

      Burst Loss Density 

   This value corresponds to "burst density" in RFC3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block. For conversion, see "General mapping
   percentages from 8 bit, fixed point numbers".

      Burst Duration  

   This value corresponds to "burst duration" in RFC3611 in the VoIP

4.8.   Configuration Dataset for vq-rtcpxr Events 

   It is the suggestion of the authors that the SIP configuration 
   framework [8] be used to establish the necessary parameters for 
   usage of vq-rtcpxr events.  A dataset for this purpose is provided 
   below:

6. Security Considerations 

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two or more endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing
   to obtain this information SHOULD be properly authenticated by the
   SIP UA using standard SIP mechanisms and according to the
   recommendations in [5].  Additionally the event content MAY be
   encrypted to ensure confidentiality; the mechanisms for providing
   confidentiality are detailed in [2].

7. Contributors 

   The authors would like to thank Rajesh Kumar, Dave Oran, Tom
   Redman and Shane Holthaus for their comments and input.
