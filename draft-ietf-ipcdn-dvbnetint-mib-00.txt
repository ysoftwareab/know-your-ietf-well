Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of EuroModem v1.0 compliant Cable Network Interface
   Units.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to
   the SNMP SMIv2[RFC2578][RFC2579][RFC2580].  The set of objects is
   consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

   This memo is a product of the DVB/DAVIC interoperability consortium
   which has been adopted as a work item of the IPCDN WG.  Comments are
   solicited and should be addressed to the author


1. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB.

                 DVB Cable Network Interface Unit MIB         May 2000


   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of
   EuroModem v1.0 compliant NIUs. The MIB specification is derived from
   the EuroModem v1.0 specification [EUROM].

   EuroModem NIUs are currently IPv4 only devices and may implement
   either SNMPv1 or SNMPv3.  This MIB is intended for NIUs that
   implement SNNMPv3 and IPv4, however all IP addresses have been
   represented as described in [RFCxx] to aid future migration to IPv6.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   3.1.  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB is structured into eight groups:

   o    The dvbNiuSystem group extends the MIB-II 'system' group with
        objects needed for cable device system management.

   o    The dvbNiuSoftware group provides objects necessary for
        managing software images and upgrades via download.  See 3.2.1

   o    The dvbNiuDhcp group configures DHCP/BOOTP functionality
        provided by the NIU.  This group is optional.  See 3.2.2

   o    The dvbNiuEvent group provides control and logging for event
        reporting.  See 3.2.3

   o    The dvbNiuIpFilter group configures filters at the IP layer.
        The IP filter table is also used to provide support for anti
        spoofing, NAT, NAPT and TOS mapping. This group is optional.
        See 3.3

   o    The dvbNiuNat group provides basic configuration for the NIU
        NAT capability. This group is optional.

   o    The dvbNiuNapt group provides basic configuration for the NIU
        NAPT capability. This group is optional.

   o    The dvbNiuEthFilter group configures filters at the link layer.
        This is primarily intended for use when the NIU is performing
        Ethernet MAC bridging. This group is optional. See 3.3

   3.2.  Management requirements

   3.2.1. Software Management

   The NIU may download and store multiple software images.  The method
   for performing the download and using the image is as follows:




Valentine       Informational - Expires September 2000               4
                 DVB Cable Network Interface Unit MIB         May 2000


   o    set dvbNiuSwServer to the address of the TFTP server for
        software upgrades.

   o    set dvbNiuSwFilename to the filename including path of the
        image to download to the NIU.

   o    set dvbNiuDownloadSlot to the image slot on the NIU in which to
        place the downloaded image.  By default this will be set to the
        next free slot or the first slot designated as 'backup'.

   o    set dvbNiuSwAdminStatus to 'initUpgrd'.

   The status of the software download is obtained by reading
   dvbNiuSwAdminStatus.  If the NIU was unable to successfully perform
   the download, the status returned will reflect the cause.  Upon
   successful download the operator must configure dvbNiuSwVerTable if
   they wish to use the image as the boot or backup version.  Note only
   one image may be marked as bootable.

   3.2.3.  IP Address Assignment

   IP addresses may be assigned to NIU interfaces using static and
   dynamic assignments.  Objects are provided by the MIB to support
   both methods.  dvbNiuStaticIpTable provides objects to assign static
   IP addresses to NIU interfaces, where each interface may have
   multiple IP addresses.  An IP address assignment in the table MUST
   NOT be removed from the table if the destination address of the SNMP
   packet removing it is using that IP address.

   dvbNiuDhcpTable provides objects for managing dynamically assigned
   IP addresses via DHCP and BOOTP.  DHCP/BOOTP requests may be for NIU
   interfaces and relayed requests from the subscriber.  If an NIU
   interface does not have dynamic IP address allocation enabled then
   the IP address of the interface MUST be specified in
   dvbNiuStaticIpTable.

   Note:  The dvbNiuStaticIpTable should be used with care.  Where
   possible dvbNiuDhcpTable SHOULD be used in preference.  When an
   interface has both a static IP address assigned and dynamic
   addresses assignment enabled, the assigned dynamic address overrides
   all assignments for that interface in the dvbNiuStaticIpTable table.

   3.2.3.  Events and Traps

   This MIB provides control facilities for reporting events through
   traps and non-volatile logging.  If events are reported through
   traps, the specified conventions must be followed.  Other means of
   event reporting are outside the scope of this document.

   Vendors SHOULD provide time-of-day clocks in NIUs to provide useful
   time stamping of events.  Where possible this SHOULD be synchronised
   with a central time source, this will aid fault finding when
   multiple equipment logs are being investigated.

Valentine       Informational - Expires September 2000               5
                 DVB Cable Network Interface Unit MIB         May 2000



   When dvbNiuEventPolicy is set to clearNow(4), the first entry in the
   log MUST be the date and time the log was cleared and the source IP
   address of the SNMP SET request which caused the log to be cleared.

   For each vendor-specific event that is reportable via TRAP, the
   vendor must create an enterprise-specific trap definition.  Trap
   definitions MUST include the event reason encoded as DisplayString
   and should be defined as:

   trapName NOTIFICATION-TYPE
           OBJECTS {
               ifIndex,
               eventReason,
               other useful objects
           }
           STATUS      current
           DESCRIPTION
               "trap description"
           ::= Object Id

   Note that ifIndex is only included if the event or trap is interface
   related.

   An example (fake) vendor defined trap might be:

   xyzVendorRsUncorrHighMark NOTIFICATION-TYPE
           OBJECTS {
               eventReason,
               xyzRsUncorrCount
           }
           STATUS  current
           DESCRIPTION
                "Sent by a NIU when a configurable number of reed
                solomon uncorrectable errors occur during the sampling
                period (5 minutes).  Used to warn a management station
                of potential degradation of the HFC."
           ::= { xyzTraps 23 }

   In this example eventReason is a DisplayString providing a human
   readable error message and xyzRsUncorrCount is a Integer32 which
   indicates the number of reed solomon uncorrectable errors during the
   epoch.

   3.2.4.  Trap Throttling

   The NIU MUST provide support for trap message throttling as
   described below.  The network operator can employ message rate
   throttling or trap limiting by manipulating the appropriate MIB
   variables.

   3.2.4.1.  Trap rate throttling


Valentine       Informational - Expires September 2000               6
                 DVB Cable Network Interface Unit MIB         May 2000


   Network operators may employ either of two rate control methods.  In
   the first method, the device ceases to send traps when the rate
   exceeds the specified maximum message rate.  It resumes sending
   traps only if reactivated by a network management station request.

   In the second method, the device resumes sending traps when the rate
   falls below the specified maximum message rate.

   The network operator configures the specified maximum message rate
   by setting the measurement interval (in seconds), and the maximum
   number of traps to be transmitted within the measurement interval.
   The operator can query the operational throttling state (to
   determine whether traps are enabled or blocked by throttling) of the
   device, as well as query and set the administrative throttling state
   (to manage the rate control method) of the device.

   3.2.4.2.  Limiting the trap rate

   Network operators may wish to limit the number of traps sent by a
   device over a specified time period.  The device ceases to send
   traps when the number of traps exceeds the specified threshold.  It
   resumes sending traps only when the measurement interval has passed.

   The network operator defines the maximum number of traps he is
   willing to handle and sets the measurement interval to a large
   number (in hundredths of a second).  For this case, the
   administrative throttling state is set to stop at threshold which is
   the maximum number of traps.

   See "Techniques for Managing Asynchronously Generated Alerts"
   [RFC1224] for further information.

   3.2.5 IP Anti-Spoofing

   The IP filter table dvbNiuIpFilterTable SHOULD be used to prevent IP
   spoofing.  To aid the network operator in preventing spoofing the
   filter table can be auto populated with anti-spoofing filters by
   setting dvbNiuIpFilterEnable to enabledAuto.  When this feature is
   enabled, filters to accept packets for the following MUST
   automatically be added:
   o    IP subnets assigned to the customer interfaces (non DVB
        interfaces) using dvbNiuStaticIpTable and removed when the IP
        subnet is deleted from dvbNiuStaticIpTable.
   o    IP addresses dynamically assigned to customer equipment through
        BOOTP relay.  Filters created in this manner are deleted either
        by a DHCP release or by the network operator.

   3.3.  Protocol Filters

   The NIU MIB provides objects for both Ethernet and IP protocol
   filters.  The Ethernet protocol filter entries can be used to limit
   NIU forwarding to a restricted set of network-layer protocols (such
   as IP, IPX, NetBIOS, and Appletalk).

Valentine       Informational - Expires September 2000               7
                 DVB Cable Network Interface Unit MIB         May 2000



   The IP protocol filter entries can be used to restrict upstream or
   downstream traffic based on source and destination IP addresses,
   transport-layer protocols (such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP), and source
   and destination TCP/UDP port numbers.

   In general, a NIU applies filters (or more properly, classifiers) in
   an order appropriate to the layering model. Specifically, the
   Ethernet layer filters are applied first, then the IP layer inbound
   filter and finally the IP layer outbound

   3.3.1.  Ethernet EtherType/SNAP/LLC Filters –
   dvbNiuEthernetFilterTable

   The Ethernet (level-2) filters are contained in the
   dvbNiuEthernetFilterTable and are applied to level-2 frames entering
   the cable modem from either the DVB MAC interface or from one of the
   CPE (Ethernet or other Ethernet like) interfaces.  These filters are
   used to prohibit the processing and forwarding of certain types of
   level-2 traffic that may be disruptive to the network.  The filters,
   as currently specified, can be set to cause the NIU to either drop
   frames which match at least one filter, or to process a frame which
   matches at least filter.  Some examples of possible configurations
   would be to only permit IP (and ARP) traffic, or to drop NETBUEI
   traffic.

   3.3.2.  IP Filtering - dvbNiuIpFilterTable

   The IP Filtering table acts as a classifier table.  Each row in the
   table describes a template against which IP packets are compared.
   The template includes source and destination addresses (and their
   associated masks), upper level protocol (e.g. TCP, UDP), source and
   destination port ranges, TOS and TOS mask. A row also contains
   interface and traffic direction match values which have to be
   considered in combination.  All columns of a particular row must
   match the appropriate fields in the packet, and must match the


Valentine       Informational - Expires September 2000               8
                 DVB Cable Network Interface Unit MIB         May 2000


   interface and direction items for the packet to result in a match to
   the packet.

   When classifying a packet, the table is scanned beginning with the
   lowest number filter.  If the agent finds a match, it performs the
   specified action.  If the matched filter has the continue bit set,
   the agent continues the scan possibly matching additional filters
   and performing the specified actions.  This allows the agent to take
   one set of actions for the 24.0.16/255.255.255.0 group and one set
   of actions for telnet packets to/from 24.0.16.30 and these sets of
   actions may not be mutually exclusive.

   Once a packet is matched, one of five actions happen based on the
   setting of dvbNiuFilterAction in the row.  The actions are:
   o    Discarded.  The packet is dropped, and no further processing is
        required.
   o    Accept.  The packet is accepted and processing of the packet
        continues.
   o    NAT.  The packet is to be accepted and have NAT applied.
        Processing of the packet continues using its new IP address.
   o    NAPT. The packet is to be accepted and have NAT applied.
        Processing of the packet continues using its new IP address and
        port number.
   o    TosMap.  Invokes the action of rewriting the TOS bits in the IP
        header based up the entry in dvbNiuIpTOSMapTable identified by
        dvbNiuIpFilterActionPtr.

   If dvbNiuIpFilterContinue is set to true, scanning of the table
   continues (unless the packet was discarded) and additional matches
   may result.

5. Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public
   internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects
   represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large
   number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of
   dvbNiuEthernetFilterTable and dvbNiuIpFilterTable may allow an end-
   user to increase their service levels, spoof their IP addresses or
   affect other end-users in either a positive or negative manner.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  In addition to those mentioned above:

   o    dvbNiuStaticIpTable and dvbNiuDhcpTable can be manipulated to
        prevent IP addresses being assigned to the NIU after a reset,
        which results in a denial of service.

   o    The NIU may have its software changed by the actions of the
        management system.  An improper software load may result in
        substantial vulnerabilities and the loss of the ability of the
        management system to control the NIU.

   o    Setting docsDevEvThrottleAdminStatus = unconstrained(1) may
        cause flooding of traps, which can disrupt network service.

   This MIB does not affect confidentiality of services on a cable
   system. The DVB/DAVIC Interoperability Consortium expects to produce
   a MIB for the security mechanism in the near future.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. It is
   recommended that the implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the User-
   based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View- based Access
   Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
