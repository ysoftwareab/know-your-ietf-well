Abstract

This document describes one certificate extension to explicitly 
state the Attribute Certificate (AC) policies that apply to a given 
Attribute Certificate.

Conventions Used In This Document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

1. Introduction

When issuing a PKC, a Certificate Authority (CA) can perform various 
levels of verification with regard to the subject identity.  A CA makes 
its verification procedures, as well as other operational rules it 
abides by, "visible" through a certificate policy, which may be 
referenced by a certificate policies extension in the PKC.

The purpose of this document is to define an AC policies extension 
able to explicitly state the AC policies that apply to a given AC, 
but not the AC policies themselves.

2. AC Policies Extension Semantics

Attribute Certificates are defined in [RFC3281].

An Attribute Certificate Policy (ACP) is a set of rules that indicates 
generic rules for registering, verifying, delivering and revoking the 
attributes contained in a particular Attribute Certificate.

It should thus be noticed that an AA does not necessarily support one 
single policy. However, for each AC that is delivered it SHALL make 
sure that the policy applies to all the attributes that are contained 
in it.

An Attribute Certificate Policy may be used by a certificate user to 
decide whether or not to trust the attributes contained in a 
certificate for a particular purpose.

When a certificate contains an AC policies extension, the extension 
MAY, at the option of the attribute certificate issuer, be either 
critical or non-critical. 

The AC Policies extension MAY be included in an attribute certificate.
Like all X.509 certificate extensions [X.509], the AC policies 
extension is defined using ASN.1 [ASN1]. 

The AC policies extension is identified by id-pe-acPolicies.

     id-pe-acPolicies OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 15 }

The AC policies extension includes a list of AC policies recognized by 
the issuing authority that apply to the attributes included in the 
attribute certificate.

AC Policies may be defined by any organization with a need.  Object 
identifiers used to identify AC Policies are assigned in accordance 
with [ITU-T Rec. X660 | ISO/IEC 9834-1].

The presence of this extension in an attribute certificate indicates 
the AC policies for which the attribute certificate is valid.

An application that recognizes this extension and its content SHALL 
process the extension regardless of the value of the criticality flag. 

If the extension is both flagged non-critical and is not recognized, 
then the application MAY ignore it. 

If the extension is flagged critical or is recognized, it indicates 
that the attributes contained in the attribute certificate SHALL only 
be used for the purpose, and in accordance with the rules implied by 
one of the indicated AC policies. If none of the AC policy identifiers 
is adequate for the application, then the AC MUST be rejected.



Francis, Pinkas                                                  Page 2


Internet-Draft            AC Policies extension           November 2003

If the extension is marked critical or is recognized, certificate 
users MUST use the list of AC policies to determine whether it is 
appropriate to use the attributes contained in that certificate for 
a particular transaction. 

2.1 AC Policy Extension Syntax

The syntax for the AC Policy extension is:

AcPoliciesSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF PolicyInformation

PolicyInformation ::= SEQUENCE {
      policyIdentifier      AcPolicyId,
      policyQualifiers      SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF 
                                     PolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL}

AcPolicyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   PolicyQualifierInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        policyQualifierId  PolicyQualifierId,
        qualifier          ANY DEFINED BY policyQualifierId }

   -- policyQualifierIds for Internet policy qualifiers

   id-qt            OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-pkix 2 }
   id-qt-acps       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-qt 4 }
   id-qt-acunotice  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-qt 5 }

   PolicyQualifierId ::=
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ( id-qt-acps | id-qt-acunotice )

-- ACPS pointer qualifier

ACPSuri ::= IA5String

-- AC user notice qualifier

ACUserNotice ::= UserNotice

-- UserNotice is defined in [RFC3280]

To promote interoperability, this document RECOMMENDS that policy 
information terms consist of only an OID. When more than one policy 
is used, the policy requirements have to be non conflicting, e.g. one 
policy may refine the general requirements mandated by another policy.

   When qualifiers are used with the special policy anyPolicy, they 
   MUST be limited to the qualifiers identified in this section.

   This specification defines two policy qualifier types for use by
   attribute certificate policy writers and attribute certificate 
   issuers.  The qualifier types are the ACPS Pointer and AC User 
   Notice qualifiers.


Francis, Pinkas                                                  Page 3


Internet-Draft            AC Policies extension           November 2003

   The ACPS Pointer qualifier contains a pointer to an Attribute
   Certification Practice Statement (ACPS) published by the AA. 
   The pointer is in the form of a URI.  Processing requirements for 
   this qualifier are a local matter. 

   The AC User notice is intended for display to a relying party when 
   an attribute certificate is used.  The application software SHOULD 
   display the AC user notice of the attribute certificate. The AC 
   user notice is defined in [RFC3280]. It has two optional fields: 
   the noticeRef field and the explicitText field.

      The noticeRef field, if used, names an organization and
      identifies, by number, a particular textual statement prepared by
      that organization.  For example, it might identify the
      organization's name and notice number 1.  In a typical
      implementation, the application software will have a notice file
      containing the current set of notices for the AA; the 
      application will extract the notice text from the file and 
      display it.  Messages MAY be multilingual, allowing the software 
      to select the particular language message for its own 
      environment.

      An explicitText field includes the textual statement directly in
      the certificate.  The explicitText field is a string with a
      maximum size of 200 characters.

   If both the noticeRef and explicitText options are included in the
   one qualifier and if the application software can locate the notice
   text indicated by the noticeRef option, then that text SHOULD be
   displayed; otherwise, the explicitText string SHOULD be displayed.

2.2 Attribute Certificate Policies

The scope of this document is not the definition of the detailed 
content of Attribute Certificate policies themselves, therefore 
specific policies are not defined in this document. 

3. Security Considerations

The Attribute Certification Policy defined in this document applies 
for all the attributes that are included in one AC. AAs shall make sure 
that the Attribute Certification Policy applies to all the attributes 
which are included in the attribute certificates they issue. 

Attributes may be dynamically grouped in several ACs. It should be 
observed that since the management of some attributes may be different, 
different policies may be used by the same AA.
