Abstract

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module
   which contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) management
   information. The intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will
   be imported and used in GMPLS related MIB modules that would
   otherwise define their own representations.

1. Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module which contains Textual Conventions
   for Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. These
   Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage
   GMPLS networks.

   This MIB module supplements the MIB module in [RFC3811] that defines
   Textual Conventions for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Management. [RFC3811] may continue to be used without this MIB module
   in networks that support only MPLS.

   Comments should be made directly to the CCAMP mailing list at
   ccamp@ops.ietf.org.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119,
   reference [RFC2119].

   For an introduction to the concepts of GMPLS, see [RFC3945].

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,

        that contains any GMPLS label. Objects with this syntax can be
        used to represent labels that have label types that are not

        gmplsPortWavelengthLabel(2) - The label is a port or wavelength
                                      label as defined in RFC 3471.

        gmplsFreeformLabel(3)       - The label is any form of label
                                      encoded as an OCTET STRING using
                                      the Textual Convention
                                      GmplsFreeformLabel.

        Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling
        protocol, the 'head' of the LSP is the source of the signaling
        (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail' is the destination
        (also known as the egress). For unidirectional LSPs, this
        usually matches the direction of flow of data.

        For manually configured unidirectional LSPs the direction of the
        LSP segment matches the direction of flow of data. For manually
        configured bidirecitonal LSPs, an arbitrary decision must be
        made about which LER is the 'head'."

4. Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other GMPLS
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects. Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

5. IANA Considerations

-- (Note to RFC-Editor:)
-- We request that you assign contiguous RFC numbers to the three GMPLS
-- MIB documents.
-- The first number to draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-tc-mib, the second to
-- draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-lsr-mib, and the third to
-- draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-te-mib.
-- (Please remove this note prior to publication.)

   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in this MIB module under the
   mplsStdMIB subtree by assigning an OID to gmplsTCStdMIB currently
   indicated by { mplsStdMIB YYY }.

   In the future, GMPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB (sic) subtree. IANA has been requested to
   manage that namespace in the SMI Numbers registry [RFC3811]. New
   assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in
   [RFC2434].

-- RFC Editor. Please replace YYY above with the OID assigned by IANA
-- and remove this note.
