Abstract 
    
   The architecture described in this document aims at giving as many 
   unicast-only end-users access to IP multicast content, this without 
   the need for their ISPs to upgrade their network infrastructure to 
   IP multicast. It further does not require any change to the unicast 
   only infrastructure nor to the end-user operating systems. The 
   access that is provided, is from a user's perspective as good as a 
   real IP multicast connection. It can be used to send and receive ASM 
   as well as SSM content. It further allows applying Authentication, 
   Authorization and Accounting (AAA) to IP Multicast.

1 Introduction 
    
   The deployment of IP multicast is not going as fast as the multicast 
   community would want. The major reason for this is that we are in 
   some sort of two-fold deadlock situation with problems situated at 
   three parties:  
   The first party involved is the ISPs. As described by Diot C. et al. 
   [3], ISPs are reluctant to deploy IP multicast because it relies on 
   a protocol architecture that requires more setup and administration 
   than the unicast architecture. This makes that in order for a 
   multicast solution to be cost efficient one will need potentially a 
   large number of multicast capable customers.  
    
   The second party is the customers. Only a minority of users knows 
   about multicast and the potential benefits this technology could 
   bring them. They are only interested in the quality of the received 
   content. Since it is for consumers not all that clear what multicast

Draft                          CastGate                  November 2001 
 
   is about and what they can do with it, they won't be asking their 
   ISPs to get multicast. 
 
   The content providers are the last group involved. Although the use 
   of multicast could result in a huge bandwidth saving, content 
   providers are not eager to invest in this new technology, because 
   there are almost no consumers for this type of content. 
     
   From the above it is clear that in order for IP multicast to become 
   ubiquitous we need to try to provide as many end-users with a 
   multicast "connection". 
    
   The work described in this document aims at breaking this deadlock 
   situation. A mechanism, which allows an Internet user with enough 
   access bandwidth to access multicast content even when not connected 
   to a multicast enabled ISP is described. In this manner we increase 
   the multicast-audience and hence make it more attractive for content 
   providers to deploy this bandwidth-saving technology. At the same 
   time, when we reach the critical mass of multicast capable end-
   users, ISPs will be more willing to deploy multicast. 
    
   The basic idea behind the solution described in this document is 
   that it is possible to encapsulate (tunnel) the multicast packets in 
   unicast UDP packets between the portion where we do have IP 
   multicast (Tunnel Server) and the end-user.  
    
   If we want to promote the use of IP multicast via a tunneling 
   mechanism then one major requirement is that the location of an 
   appropriate tunnel server and the tunneling itself is fully 
   transparent for the user and the applications. This dictates a 
   mechanism that automatically locates the best tunnel end-point. 
    
   The CastGate architecture follows the principal Internet design 
   "philosophy", namely that one should move complexity to the edges of 
   the network and keep the middle of the network simple. It is capable 
   of giving every unicast end-user access to IP multicast, this 
   without any modification neither to the user's operating system nor 
   to the unicast or multicast infrastructure.

   Tunnel Server (TS): End-point of one or more UMTP tunnels. Typically 
   this is located in the multicast enabled part of the Internet but it 
   could also be placed in a non-multicast part of a network and use on 
   its turn an UMTP tunnel towards a Tunnels server who is located in 
   the Multicast enabled part of the network. 
    
   Relay Tunnel Server (RTS): Is a Tunnel Server, which uses an UMTP 
   tunnel to receive IP multicast. It can be used to place the fan-out 
   point closer to the end-users without the need to deploy native IP 
   multicast up to the fan-out point. E.g. could be placed at or 
   integrated with a Broadband Access Server. 
    
   Tunnel Database Server (TDS): A host which stores information about 
   the available Tunnel Servers and for what (sub)networks, Country or 
   Region they are willing to act as tunnel end-point. 
     
   Root Tunnel Database Server (RTDS): A Tunnel Database server located 
   anywhere on the Internet, but with a DNS name known to all members 
   in the CastGate architecture. 
 
   Authorative Tunnel Database server (ATDS): A Tunnel Database server 
   located within an Autonomous System who is authorative for the 
   Tunnel Servers located within the AS. 
    
   CastGate Client Service CCS): A Service installed on the client's 
   LAN segment capable of intercepting IGMP Vx [4,5,6] join messages 
   and acting as an IGMP Vx querier. It will join the sessions for 
   which it sees joins and all received data is tunneled towards the 
   "best" Tunnel Server. Data received on the tunnel is multicasted 
   locally. 
    
   CastGate Enabled Application: Any kind of multicast application 
   (receive only or send and receive) where the CastGate technology was 
   integrated. The application is capable of detecting the availability 
   of native multicast; if it is not available it switches to a 
   tunneled mode of operation.

3 Application Level Tunneling 
    
   In the CastGate architecture we use an application level tunneling 
   mechanism where tunneled data (i.e. IP multicast payload) is sent 
   over a UDP unicast "connection" between the two tunnel endpoints. 
   The client uses a control mechanism to indicate to the tunnel end-
   point which multicast address and port number to join. All data 
   received on this multicast channel is then encapsulated in UDP 
   datagram packets and sent to the client. Clients will decapsulate 
   and multicast the received packets locally. The same mechanism is 
   used in the other direction, which makes bi-directional 
   communication possible. 
 
   The client applications, however, must satisfy the following 
   conditions: 
    
   * Their multicast packets must use UDP. 
   * The tunnel endpoint must have a way of knowing each (group, port) 
   that the application uses. 
   * The application must not rely upon the source address of its 
   incoming multicast packets. In particular, the application must not 
   use source addresses to identify the original data source(s). 
    
   Most multicast based applications; especially those based on RTP [7] 
   satisfy these requirements. 
    
   This application level tunneling has the big advantage that no 
   special privileges are needed to run the end-user application and 
   that there is no need for kernel-level access as compared to kernel-
   level tunneling solutions like implementing a full-blown routing 
   protocol like DVMRP [8]. 
 
   The CastGate architecture uses the UDP multicast tunneling protocol 
   (UMTP)[9]. The UMTP protocol consists of a tunnel "Slave" and tunnel 
   "Master". The Tunnel Slave resides on the multicast enabled part of 
   the Internet and will be referenced in this document as the Tunnel 
   Server (TS) and will - on command of one or more Master agents - be 
   joining potentially multiple multicast channels. The packets 
   received on the multicast channels will be unicast UDP-encapsulated 
   and send towards the appropriate Masters.  
    
   The Tunnel Master is an agent running on the end-user's machine and 
   will request the Tunnel Server to join, and tunnel one or more 
   multicast channels. The encapsulated data is re-multicasted locally.  
 
   The Master agent can be integrated in a multicast enabled 
   application or can be part of a separate launching application (e.g. 
   Session Directory). 
    
   With UMTP, once a Master-Slave relationship has been established it 
   is possible to exchange IP multicast bi-directionally. 
   UMTP also supports the tunneling of SSM multicast sessions [10] by 
   providing the IP source address of the content originator, as well

   as the multicast group IP address and the port number to join in the 
   join message to the Tunnel Server. 
    
   The reader is pointed to [8], for full details about the UMTP 
   protocol. In section 6, we discuss some enhancements to the UMTP 
   Protocol. 
 
4 Dynamic Tunnel Server location. 
    
   If we want to have a user-friendly solution, we cannot expect the 
   user to know which Tunnel Server to use. Further, if we would 
   statically configure a list of servers it would not be feasible for 
   an average end-user to decide which Tunnel Server would be best. 
    
   Hence we use a dynamic and fully transparent mechanism to locate the 
   "best" Tunnel Server for a given client.  
    
   To help in locating a set of the most suitable Tunnel Servers for a 
   given end-user, we use a hierarchical system of Tunnel Database 
   Servers. Tunnel Servers are registered with one or more of these 
   Tunnel Database Servers. 
    
   The basic idea behind our approach is that we first obtain a list of 
   Tunnel Servers coarsely appropriate for the client (Coarse Grain 
   Tunnel Server Location) and then use a "measurement" to determine 
   the "best" Tunnel Server (Fine Grain Tunnel Server Location).  
    
   The coarsely appropriate Tunnel Servers could be those assigned to 
   the clientÆs subnet or network if these do exists (e.g. those 
   located at the ISP). Alternatively this could be Tunnel Servers in 
   the clientÆs country or Region. Finally, if there are no Tunnel 
   Servers available at the region level then a set of default Tunnel 
   Servers is used.  
    
   The second phase is used to actively measure the path and server 
   characteristics to make a more "calculated" decision about which 
   Tunnel Server is likely to give the best tunnel performance. 
    
4.1 Coarse Grain Tunnel Server Location 
    
4.1.1 The Hierarchical Tunnel Database 
    
   The Hierarchical Tunnel Database is a major component of the 
   CastGate architecture and is used to obtain a list of Tunnel Servers 
   (TS) roughly appropriate for the Client. It is composed of several 
   Tunnel Database Servers (TDS) arranged in a hierarchical manner, and 
   contains - in a distributed way - information about the "Tunnel 
   Regions" to which each Tunnel Server is assigned. 
    
   A Tunnel Region defines for which part of the Internet the Tunnel 
   Server is willing to act. We have three regions: local, country and 
   geographic region. With local we indicate Tunnel Servers located in 
   the corporate/ISP network; with country we indicate all Tunnel 
 
Expires January 2002                                          [Page 6] 

Draft                          CastGate                  November 2001 
 
   Servers located in a given country and with geographic region we 
   indicate the Tunnel Servers located in the neighboring countries, 
   e.g. the tunnel servers in Europe for a client located in the UK. 
   Since it is possible that a network spans multiple countries it is 
   allowed to assign a Tunnel Server to a combination of Tunnel Regions 
   for example to indicate that the Tunnel Server is only allowed to 
   act for those clients of the network located in a specific country. 
    
   The Tunnel Database hierarchy is inspired on the DNS system and is 
   composed of at least two Root Tunnel Database Servers located in 
   physically dispersed places. It has potentially multiple levels of 
   sub Tunnel Database Servers. These Tunnel Database Servers are 
   either authorative for a country, an Autonomous System or one or 
   more networks. At the leafs of the hierarchy we find the Tunnel 
   Servers themselves.  
    
   We do not limit the number of levels in the hierarchy, because it 
   allows flexible deployment scenarios e.g. four levels of Tunnel 
   Database Servers could prove useful in a situation where a country-
   level ISP deployed its own Tunnel Database Server but has a 
   corporate client who wants to be in control of which of his subnets 
   gets to use what (local) Tunnel Server(s). 
    
   Each Tunnel Database Server in the hierarchy can have one or more 
   Peer Tunnel Database Servers. These Peer Tunnel Database Servers are 
   synchronized copies of each other and are used for redundancy 
   purposes and for load balancing. 
    
   The Tunnel Database Hierarchy is maintained manually. An 
   administrator of a Tunnel Database Server or Tunnel Server needs to 
   obtain a login and password from the parent Tunnel Database Server 
   administrator before the Tunnel Database Server or Tunnel Server can 
   be hooked into the hierarchy. 
    
   The login and password are needed to prevent unauthorized Tunnel 
   Database Servers or Tunnel Servers from hijacking either whole 
   Tunnel Database sub-levels or networks with CastGate clients.  
    
   Once a login and password is obtained for the parent Tunnel Database 
   Server(s), it is possible to use a dynamic mechanism to add Tunnel 
   Database Servers or Tunnel Servers below these parents. This dynamic 
   mechanism allows flexible addition, migration and removal of Tunnel 
   Servers and Tunnel Database Servers.  
    
   The parent Tunnel Database Servers are automatically discovered via 
   a query in the distributed database and the child Tunnel Database 
   Server or Tunnel Server is automatically registered with all the 
   parents. 
    
4.1.2 Tunnel Database Server Registration 
     
   The configuration parameters of a Tunnel Database Server consist of: 
   a list of network(s) or sub network(s) for which the Tunnel Database

   Server should become authoritative and a country code. The country 
   is typically specified in case of a country-level Tunnel Database 
   Server, but it can also be combined with a networks list to indicate 
   that the Tunnel Database Server is authoritative for all Tunnel 
   Servers assigned to the indicated networks and located in the 
   indicated country. 
    
   e.g. pan-European network 134.34.0.0/16 
   Configuration of Tunnel Database Server for Tunnel Servers located 
   in Spain:  
    
   country=ES 
   networks=134.34.0.0/16 
    
   Configuration of Tunnel Database Server for Tunnel Servers located 
   in Finland: 
    
   country=FI 
   networks=134.34.0.0/16 
    
   The automatic discovery of the parent Tunnel Database Servers 
   consists of querying the Hierarchical Tunnel Database for each 
   configured network range combined with the optional country. The 
   query starts at one of the root Tunnel Database servers and consists 
   of performing a longest prefix match between the network range 
   provided in the query and the network ranges of the registered 
   Tunnel Database Servers in the Hierarchical Tunnel Database. If no 
   results are found, a match using the country code is tried.  
   The result of the query will yield potentially one or more Tunnel 
   Database Servers authoritative for the network or country. The 
   returned results contain the IP address, port and prefix length for 
   each of the matching Tunnel Database Servers. The prefix length is 
   the prefix length of the network range that matched in the case of a 
   longest prefix match or zero in the case of a country match. 
    
   The action is repeated against one of the returned Tunnel Database 
   Servers (randomly selected), until no longer any match is found. 
    
   It is possible that the last queried Tunnel Database Server 
   corresponds to a peer Tunnel Database Server. In such a case we will 
   need to perform a ôRegion Transferö with one of the peers prior to 
   registration. This region transfer is used to make sure that Tunnel 
   Database Server has an up-to-date database before being hooked into 
   the hierarchy. 
   The steps to decide if the last queried Tunnel Database Server 
   corresponds to a peer are indicated in the pseudo code located on 
   the next page.

4.1.3 Tunnel Server registration 
    
   The Tunnel Server registration also uses a similar automatic 
   mechanism to figure out the appropriate Tunnel Database Server to 
   register with. This will allow easy addition of Tunnel Servers as 
   the use of IP multicast content increases.  
     
   The configuration information of a Tunnel Server is comparable to 
   that of a Tunnel Database Server. It consists of the registration 
   login and password, the (sub)network(s) for which it is allowed to 
   act and optionally the country to which the Tunnel Server is 
   assigned. The geographic region to which a Tunnel Server belongs is 
   inferred from the provided country code. This information is here 
   also used to automatically locate the Tunnel Database Servers to 
   register with. Alternatively it is also possible to just indicate in 
   the configuration the list of Tunnel Database Servers to register 
   with, but this is of course less flexible.   
    
   If the Tunnel Database Server where the Tunnel Server is registered 
   has some local Tunnel Server Assignment Policy (TSAP), then the TSAP 
   takes precedence over the registered information. The Tunnel Server 
   Assignment Policy consist of simple rules which tells a Tunnel 
   Database Server to "reroute" clients from certain network range 
   and/or country to other Tunnel Servers. The use of TSAP proves 
   useful to allow some form of Tunnel Traffic Engineering, where 
   clients located in some subnets are administratively assigned to 
   other Tunnel Server(s) than the ones they normally use.  
    
   A Tunnel Server with a configuration containing a networks= 
   0.0.0.0/0 entry, is denoted a "Public" Tunnel Server, because it can 
   be used by clients independent of their network. These Tunnel 
   Servers register with the root Tunnel Database Servers or if they 
   contain a country line, with the Country Tunnel Database Servers. In 
   the latter, they are public for clients located in the country and 
   its neighboring countries. When the Public Tunnel Servers are 
   registered with the root Tunnel Database Servers, they function as 
   "Tunnel Servers of last resort".  
   If we want to boot-strap the use of CastGate and actively promote 
   the use of IP multicast then we will need to deploy multiple of 
   these Public Tunnel Servers to accommodate those end-users whose ISP 
   did not yet deploy the CastGate technology. 
    
   Once a Tunnel Server is started, it uses each configured 
   (sub)network address range optionally combined with the country code 
   to iteratively query the Hierarchical Tunnel Database in order to 
   locate the Tunnel Database Servers authoritative for the Tunnel 
   ServerÆs configured (sub)network and/or country. The iterative query 
   performed on the Tunnel Database consists of performing a longest 
   prefix match between the provided network address range and the 
   network ranges of the authoritative Tunnel Database Servers. If no 
   results are found, a match using the country code is tried. One of 
   the returned Tunnel Database Servers is on its turn queried with the 
   same parameters.

Draft                          CastGate                  November 2001 
 
   The query is repeated till no results are returned. The list of 
   Tunnel Database Servers to which the last queried Tunnel Database 
   Server belonged, is the list with which the Tunnel Server needs to 
   register. 
    
4.1.4 Tunnel Database update 
    
   At regular intervals after the initial registration an update of the 
   information in the Tunnel Database(s) is performed and consists of 
   re-registering. An entry in the Tunnel Database is removed if it is 
   not updated within two times the update interval. At Tunnel Server 
   or Tunnel Database Server shutdown, a de-registration is performed. 
   Details about the registration messages and the timing can be found 
   in section 5.4.  
    
   As with DNS, to optimize the interaction it is possible to cache the 
   results of the queries in order to prevent the need to iterate 
   through the whole hierarchy. It should be noted that the parents of 
   the Tunnel Database Servers with which a registration was performed 
   should be cached, this to guarantee the registration/update with 
   newly added parent Tunnel Database Servers. 
    
    
4.1.5 Tunnel Server location 
    
   The client part of the architecture can range from a Session 
   Directory tool with integrated CastGate functionality to a simple 
   JAVA CastGate client Applet running in a web browser. The initial 
   step performed by a client will be the retrieval of the list of 
   Tunnel Servers coarsely appropriate for the clientÆs location.  
    
   The clientÆs location can be the geographical location (i.e. country 
   or region) or the position in the network topology (i.e. 
   subnetwork/IP address). The clientÆs geographical location is either 
   configured at installation or inferred from the DNS name. The latter 
   method simply consists of looking at the country code extension of 
   the DNS name and is especially useful when the client component is 
   downloaded and executed in a web browser (JAVA Applet CastGate 
   Client). If the country cannot be inferred from the DNS name, then 
   it should be asked for to the user. 
    
   A Client typically has only knowledge of the root Tunnel Database 
   Servers and will use one of them as a start for an iterative query 
   of the Hierarchical Tunnel Database in order to obtain a list of 
   Tunnel Servers appropriate for his location. To optimize this 
   process it is always possible for the client to cache the location 
   of the Tunnel Database Servers authoritative for his location.  
    
   When no prior results have been cached, a client will perform the 
   following actions:  
    
   The client will at random choose one of the root Tunnel Database 
   Servers and send a Tunnel Server Query message towards it. A Tunnel

   Server Query message contains as parameter the country code of the 
   client. At the Tunnel Database Server, first a match is tried 
   between the client's IP address and the registered (sub)networks of 
   the Tunnel Servers or Tunnel Database Servers, using longest prefix 
   matching. If no match is found, a match at country level is 
   attempted; if no match is found a match at the geographic region is 
   tried. A number of Tunnel Server entries in the Tunnel Database are 
   registered as "Public" and are returned if no match is found at the 
   geographic region. 
    
   The query either yields a list of Tunnel Servers or a list of Tunnel 
   Database Servers. In the latter case, one of the Tunnel Database 
   Servers is randomly selected and queried with the same Tunnel Server 
   Query message. This iterative querying continues till a list of 
   Tunnel Servers is returned or no matches are found. 
      
   The list of most recently queried Tunnel Database Servers can be 
   cached on disk by the client application as to speed up the process 
   when running the application at a later time. 
    
4.2 Fine Grain Tunnel Server Selection 
    
   As the result of querying the Hierarchical Tunnel Database we obtain 
   a list of Tunnel Servers coarsely appropriate for the client. These 
   Tunnel Servers can be located anywhere in the geographic region 
   (e.g. Europe), the country or network. It is clear that especially 
   for Tunnel Servers located in the geographic region or country there 
   is potentially a significant difference in term of ôtunnel 
   performanceö they offer between the different Tunnel Servers. The 
   ôtunnel performanceö will depend on the characteristics of the path 
   (throughput, delay, jitter and loss) and on the load on the Tunnel 
   Server. But, even for Tunnel Servers located in the clientÆs network 
   there can possibly be a difference, mainly attributable to the load 
   on the Tunnel Server and to a lesser extent to the path 
   characteristics. 
    
   In order to make an informed decision when selecting the final 
   Tunnel Server, we need to actively measure the characteristics of 
   the paths to each Tunnel Server and measure the load on each Tunnel 
   Server. Armed with measurements of the current network state we can 
   perform application-level congestion avoidance. By application-level 
   congestion avoidance we mean that applications can use estimates of 
   traffic volume to actively avoid paths that are currently heavily 
   loaded. It should be noted that our measurements will only help us 
   avoid the network congestion that exists at the time, and for long-
   lived tunnel sessions it is possible that during the course of the 
   tunneling congestion occurs along the path. 
    
4.2.1 Path Characterization. 
    
   The Tunnel Server/Path characterization consists of setting up 
   "test" CastGate tunnels towards all the Tunnel Servers that were 
   returned from the query in the Tunnel Database.

   Through such a "test" tunnel a special "test channel" is joined 
   (address and port TBD). The Tunnel Server will act differently for 
   this address/port combination as compared to "normal" channels in 
   the sense that all traffic sent towards this special channel is 
   looped back towards the client. We send on this channel 5 
   consecutive data packets of 512 bytes and calculate the average RTT. 
   The average RTT is then used to decide which Tunnel Server to use. 
   We use 512 bytes measurement packets because this is the average 
   packet size one sees in regular IP Multicast sessions. 
    
   It should be noted that initially one of the coarsely appropriate 
   Tunnel Servers is used as "temporary" Tunnel Server. On a tunnel 
   towards such a temporary Tunnel Server it is already possible to 
   join some channels (like the Global Session Announcement channel) 
   during the measurement time. The temporary Tunnel Server could be 
   for example the Tunnel Server that was used in a previous run. 
    
   The test-packets of 512 bytes are sent, one after the other. The 
   sending rate should not exceed the administratively set access 
   bandwidth or in the case of asymmetric technologies the smallest 
   value of the administratively set access bandwidth tuple divided by 
   the number of Tunnel Servers to probe. The limiting of the sending 
   rate is induced by the fact that one never should send faster than 
   the administratively imposed bandwidth otherwise one is measuring 
   the parameters of access technology/parameters rather than the 
   Tunnel Server characteristics. 
   The probing of all the Tunnel Servers can be performed in parallel 
   because the probing is lightweight and the aggregate sending rate 
   does not exceeds the access bandwidth. All replies should be 
   received within a time-out-period set to [TBD] seconds. Tunnel 
   Servers with a total measurement time larger than [TBD] seconds are 
   not taken in to account when making a decision, as they will give 
   too limited performance. 
    
   The client calculates the mean RTT for each Tunnel Server and 
   selects the Tunnel Server with the smallest mean RTT as ôbestö.  
    
   After the measurement we close the tunnels towards the Tunnel 
   Servers except the temporary Tunnel Server and the "best" tunnel 
   server to perform tunnel hand-over.  
    
4.2.2 Tunnel Hand-over  
    
   If the "best" server is different from the temporary tunnel server a 
   tunnel hand-over procedure is started. 
    
   Once the client has chosen the appropriate server, a UMTP tunnel is 
   set up with this server. From the moment we start to receive data on 
   a joined channel we stop the tunneling of that channel on the 
   temporary UMTP Tunnel. We continue to do this until we no longer 
   have any "temporary" sessions open. Finally we close the UMTP Tunnel 
   with the temporary server.

5 Enhanced UMTP 
    
   NOTE: The following should in the end be merged in a new version of 
   the UMTP draft and has been kept intentionally terse. 
    
5.1 Compact DATA trailers 
    
   The UMTP protocol as defined in [9], has quite large trailers (12 or 
   16 octets) which could lead to unnecessary fragmentation, this is 
   why we enhanced the UMTP protocol by defining a "compact" DATA 
   command FLOW_DATA, where each channel (i.e. group and port) is 
   identified by a unique 2 octet identifier. 
    
   4-octet trailer: 
     
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
 
   The FlowID value is obtained from the peer via an option negotiation 
   addition to UMTP. 
    
5.2 Explicit Join Acknowledgement 
    
   We introduce explicit join acknowledgement to allow enhanced 
   functionalities like FlowID exchange and channel level 
   authorization. The packet layout is the same as in the UMTP 
   specification where JOIN_ACK is assigned the value 10 and JOIN_NACK 
   the value 11. If after a timeout JOIN_TIMEOUT [TBD] no ACK or NACK 
   is received a retransmission is performed, this is repeated 
   JOIN_REPEAT [TBD] times. 
    
   A client waits for these messages if the PROBE_ACK contained a valid 
   OPT_MAGIC value. 
    
5.3 Option Negotiation 
    
   We introduced Option Negotiation to the UMTP protocol, in order to 
   make it more flexible. 
    
   The octets before the PROBE, PROBE_ACK, PROBE_NACK, JOIN, JOIN_ACK 
   and JOIN_NACK trailers are used to exchange option information. The 
   options consist of a list of option packets one after the other and 
   terminated by the OPT_END option.

6 Tunnel Database Server Interactions. 
 
   All the following communications, involving the Tunnel Database, 
    
   * Registration of Tunnel Server with Tunnel Database Server 
   * Query of Tunnel Database by the client 
   * Transfer between peer Tunnel Database Servers 
    
   are based on HTTP (GET) interactions. 
    
   The use of HTTP allows us to use available web servers and database 
   back-ends to act as authorative Tunnel Database Servers, and allows 
   the Tunnel Servers and Clients to use a well documented and 
   understood protocol. 
    
   All GET interactions have the following format: 
    
   GET /script/castgate.cgs?ACTION=Name& .... 
    
   This is, depending on the value of the ACTION parameter followed by 
   one or more additional Name-Value pairs. 
    
   In the case that the list of parameters is exceeding the maximal 
   allowed length of a HTTP GET interaction, we need to use a HTTP POST 
   interaction, which carries the same information as the GET 
   interaction. 
    
   All registration and removal actions need to contain a login and 
   password. This to prevent that entries are removed by unauthorized

   persons. In some situations one will need to obtain a valid login 
   and password prior to registration. (See section 8) 
    
6.1 The REGISTER Action. 
    
   The REGISTER Action is used when performing a registration of a 
   Tunnel Server. The parameter list for this action is composed of the 
   following Name-Value pairs: 
    
   SOURCE: The local IP address of the Tunnel Server. It will be this 
   IP address that will be returned by the Authorative Tunnel Database 
   server when queried for an appropriate Tunnel Server. E.g. 
   SOURCE="134.184.50.57" 
     
   PORT: The UDP Port on which the Tunnel Service is waiting for UMTP 
   joins.  
 
   NETWORKS: is a comma-separated list of networks, in prefix notation 
   for which a Tunnel Server is willing to act. E.g. 
   NETWORKS="134.184.1.0/24,134.184.2.0/24" 
    
   These network address ranges are the ranges used by the Firewalls or 
   NATs on their external interface (i.e. public address range) if the 
   Tunnel Server is located in a network shielded by one or more 
   Firewalls or is using NATs. 
    
   COUNTRY: the ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code of the Country for which 
   it is willing to act as Tunnel Server. E.g. COUNTRY="BE". 
    
   From the moment a Tunnel Server uses a Country name-value pair it 
   indicates that it wants to cooperate in the global effort to provide 
   access to IP multicast content. The real scope of this cooperation 
   depends on the location in the Tunnel Database hierarchy where this 
   Tunnel Server is being registered. I.e. if it registers with the 
   root Tunnel Servers then it is truly a 'public' Tunnel Server for 
   whole the country and also for the region. In case the registration 
   is done with a Tunnel Database Server authorative for a certain 
   network then it is a public Tunnel Server, but only for clients in 
   the indicated country (and region) and located within the network(s) 
   for which the Tunnel Database Server has authority.    
 
6.2 BYE Action. 
    
   A Tunnel Server uses this command when it is being put "off-line". 
    
   This action contains the following parameters: 
    
   SOURCE: The local IP address of the Tunnel Server. 
   PORT: The UDP Port of the service that is shutting down.

6.3 QUERY Action. 
    
   This is used - prior to registration - by a Tunnel Server to 
   retrieve the list of Tunnel Database Servers authorative for this 
   Tunnel Server. 
    
   The Tunnel Client uses this message to retrieve the list of 
   potential Tunnel Servers. 
    
   To make a distinction between the different types of query we use 
   the TYPE keyword. TYPE=TDS is used to query for the list of 
   authorative Tunnel Database Servers, and TYPE=TS is used to query 
   for Tunnel Servers. 
    
   The message contains the following MANDATORY field: 
    
   COUNTRY: ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code of the country where the end-
   user is located. 
    
   The longest prefix match is performed with the source IP address of 
   the message and will potentially yield one or more results. 
    
6.4 TRANSFER Action 
    
   Similar to DNS we define a transfer mechanism to synchronize a 
   freshly started Tunnel Database Server with his peer TDSs. 
    
   This action is secured by installing a common login and password in 
   all peer TDS. 
    
   No additional parameters are defined.  
    
6.5 Return Value format 
    
   The REGISTRATION and the BYE actions don't return any data; hence 
   standard HTTP return codes are sufficient. 
    
   For the Query and Transfer actions on the other hand we will need to 
   return a list of Tunnel Database Servers or Tunnel Servers. 
    
   The headers are standard HTTP headers where the Content-Type 
   corresponds to the txt/xml mime-type. 
    
   The proposed format for the data part is based on XML and has the 
   following DTD: 
    
   <!ELEMENT SERVERS (SERVER)*>  
   <!ELEMENT SERVER (ADDRESS, PORT, TYPE, PREFIXLEN?)>  
   <!ELEMENT ADDRESS (#PCDATA)>  
   <!ELEMENT PORT (#PCDATA)>  
   <!ELEMENT TYPE (#PCDATA)> 
   <!ELEMENT PREFIXLEN (#PCDATA)>

Draft                          CastGate                  November 2001 
 
   Here ADDRESS corresponds with the (local) IP address in dotted 
   decimal notation that was used in the registration of the Tunnel 
   Server or Tunnel Database Server. PORT, corresponds to the TCP port 
   used by the Tunnel Database server or the UDP port used by the 
   Tunnel Server. 
   The TYPE field indicates whether the returned IP Address and port 
   belong to a Tunnel Server or to a Tunnel Database Server. If the 
   type value corresponds to '1' then this is a Tunnel Database Server 
   otherwise when the value corresponds to '0' then this is a Tunnel 
   Server. The PREFIXLEN field is only present in replies to TYPE=TDS 
   type of queries and is used to determine if the returned TDS entries 
   are peers or parents.

   In case of TYPE=TDS query yielding two Tunnel Database Server 
   entries

7 Firewalls and NATs. 
 
7.1 Tunnel Server location. 
    
   The Tunnel Database and Tunnel Server location are based on the HTTP 
   protocol (see Section 6), and are hence possible through firewalls 
   and NATs. Despite the fact that the messages do contain IP addresses 
   and network ranges, there is no need to modify the NATs because the 
   addresses will only be used in a local context. 
    
   One should note that we need to use public address ranges (used by 
   external interface of the Firewall/NAT) in the registration of 
   Tunnel Database servers and Tunnel Servers if they are behind a 
   firewall. This, because in the longest prefix match we use the 
   source IP address of the request, which is in such a case one of the 
   addresses in the "public" range.

7.2 Native Tunneling 
    
   Since all our communication is based on the UMTP protocol and in 
   view of the fact that it is using the UDP protocol it is not 
   affected by NATs. 
    
   On the other hand due to the restrictions imposed by firewalls it is 
   typically impossible to set up multiple UMTP tunnels towards 
   different Tunnel Servers. This because the most common type of 
   Firewalls, proxy firewalls use a fixed mapping between the tuple 
   (firewall IP address, port) and a tuple (UMTP Server IP address, 
   port). 
    
   By use of a UMTP Proxy module in the firewall or as process running 
   on a machine in the "Demilitarized Zone", one could "restore" the 
   dynamic capabilities, which are needed to locate the "best" Tunnel 
   Server. 
    
   For this we need to add proxy functionality to the UMTP protocol and 
   this can be achieved by defining a new command called PROXY [Value 
   TBD], which still uses the same trailer layout as all the other UMTP 
   packets. But in case of a PROXY command we change the interpretation 
   of the field "(IPv4) multicast address", which will now contain the 
   (unicast) IP address of the Tunnel Server and the "Port" field will 
   contain the port of the tunnel server to contact. All other fields 
   are not used.  
    
   This PROXY message will be sent as the first message in the UMTP 
   communication between the client and the firewall/proxy. From the 
   moment the UMTP Proxy received this message it knows that it needs 
   to forward all messages to the tunnel server defined in the PROXY 
   command. This forwarding continues until the UMTP Proxy receives the 
   TEAR_DOWN message. 
    
7.3 UMTP over HTTP 
    
   Many corporate environments will only install such UMTP Proxy 
   functionality after enough internal clients requested it. In order 
   to support also these end-users an alternative tunneling mechanism 
   is proposed. 
    
   One obvious solution is to use the HTTP protocol to achieve firewall 
   traversal, because this is probably the only protocol for which we 
   can be sure that it will be granted traversal. The trade-off for 
   this approach is that carrying IP Multicast content (typically audio 
   and video) in a TCP connection could result in a sub-optimal user-
   experience. But, the need for access to multimedia content though 
   firewalls has already triggered media streaming server vendors in 
   implementing (pseudo) streaming through HTTP in one way or another 
   and has shown the viability of such an approach. 
     
   The basic idea is that initially a CastGate Client will try to 
   communicate with a CastGate Tunnel Server via UMTP; if this fails,

Draft                          CastGate                  November 2001 
 
   HTTP will be used. In order not to modify the architecture too much 
   we will be carrying unmodified UMTP packets inside HTTP.  
    
    
   One would be inclined to use one HTTP connection to carry the data 
   for multiple groups, but this is not appropriate because TCPÆs rate 
   halving in case of packet loss would affect all sessions rather than 
   only one single session. Hence, one HTTP connection will be used for 
   each individual session (RTP/RTCP traffic will be carried in the 
   same HTTP connection).  
    
   We use HTTP POST interactions because this defines a way to carry 
   arbitrary blocks of data from the client to the server and reverse. 
    
   In order to detect the packet boundaries in the TCP byte stream we 
   use an explicit 2-octet packet length field (in network order) at 
   the beginning of each packet. 
    
   In the HTTP Header we use the following fields in order to 
   communicate information to HTTP proxies so that they handle the 
   streams better. 
    
   Date Header - the reply should include a "Date" header with a value 
   at an arbitrary point in the past. This keeps proxies from caching 
   the transaction. 
   Expires Header û Same as the Date header. 
   Pragma: No cache - Tells many HTTP 1.0 proxies not to cache. 
   Cache-Control: no-cache û Tells HTTP 1.1 proxies not to cache. 
    
   A special content type has been defined:  application/x-umtp-
   tunneled 
    
   PROBE, PROBE_ACK and PROBE NACK are not used because user 
   authentication can be replaced by HTTP level authentication and 
   capability negotiation is not needed because the use of HTTP 
   tunneling presumes support for FlowID based data transport and 
   precludes the use of TCP Compatible/Friendly UMTP data transport. 
   The source and destination cookies values in the UMTP messages will 
   be ignored because the TCP sequence numbers provide an even higher 
   level of protection against spoofing. 
    
 
8 Deployment scenarios. 
    
8.1 Public 
    
   The initial goal of this architecture is to promote the use of IP 
   Multicast by a large number of end-users. Before ISPs start to 
   deploy the CastGate technology, we have the option of deploying 
   "public" Tunnel Servers. These "pubic" Tunnel Servers are preferably 
   located at the "edge" of the IP multicast cloud. These "public" 
   Tunnel Servers will register with the Root Tunnel Database Servers 
 
Expires January 2002                                         [Page 22] 

Draft                          CastGate                  November 2001 
 
   or with the Tunnel Database Servers authorative for the country in 
   which the Tunnel Server is located. 
    
   The nice thing about this architecture is that we don't need from 
   "day one" a lot of Tunnel Servers; it can grow gradually as more 
   end-users start to use the CastGate technology. 
    
8.2 Private 
    
   Some ISPs will want to be in control of the usage of the CastGate 
   technology; hence they will deploy their own Tunnel Database 
   Server(s). This will allow them to decide which end-user uses which 
   cluster of Tunnel Server. The Tunnel Servers (and Tunnel Database 
   Servers) could be fitted with support for RADIUS, which would allow 
   for enforcing a user policy from a central location. Such policy 
   could consist of authenticating a user using the CHAP mechanism of 
   Enhanced UMTP. Each authenticated user is granted access to all 
   "public" channels, but depending on the type of subscription (user 
   profile) the user is granted access to other "commercial" channels 
   (e.g. pay-per-view). It is even feasible to relay for some channels 
   the RADIUS authentication to the content providersÆ own RADIUS 
   server(s). 
    
   Within the ISP/Corporate context multiple possible deployment 
   scenarios exist, here are only a few of them: 
    
   1) Basic Approach 
    
   An ISP could deploy a relay Tunnel Server. This Relay Tunnel Server 
   uses the dynamic Tunnel Server location mechanism to find an 
   appropriate Tunnel Server who is located in the IP Multicast cloud. 
   It then registers itself with the Country Tunnel Database Server(s) 
   or with the Root Tunnel Database Servers. By using this method it is 
   possible to "aggregate" already some traffic, which is a first 
   optimization as compared to the situation where each end-user of the 
   ISP is using a separate tunnel. 
    
   As more and more people start the use this Relay Tunnel Server it 
   will get overloaded. In such an event, the ISP has two options: 
    
   Add one or more Relay Tunnel Servers. 
    
   This is of course a sub-optimal solution because this will mean an 
   extra Tunnel to the IP Multicast enabled part of the Internet. 
    
   or use the method described in the next point. 
    
   2) Medium Approach 
    
   In this scenario, the ISP enables IP Multicast up to the first 
   router "inside" his network. This could consist of deploying native 
   IP multicast or be made up of a PIM-SM tunnel or DVMRP tunnel. 
    
 
Expires January 2002                                         [Page 23] 

Draft                          CastGate                  November 2001 
 
   On one of the LAN segments of that "enabled" router it is possible 
   to deploy multiple Tunnel Servers. 
    
   To further optimize, and to keep traffic out of the core of his 
   network he has the option of deploying one or more relay Tunnel 
   Servers closer to the end-users. (i.e. POP, BAS Server etc.)  
    
   3) Maximum Approach 
    
   Besides deploying multiple Tunnel Servers at multicast enabled 
   portions of his network, an ISP has also the option of deploying one 
   or more of his own Tunnel Database Servers. This will allow the ISP 
   to be in control of who gets to use what Tunnel Server. 
    
   Also in this scenario, it is possible to place the "fan-out" closer 
   to the end-users. 
        
9 Security Considerations 
    
   In the system it is possible for a rogue Tunnel Server to register 
   itself as being willing to server for a certain network, with the 
   purpose of redirecting Tunnel Users towards him. 
    
   To prevent this, we should always perform consistency checking at 
   the Tunnel Database Servers:  
    
   The list of networks provided in the NETWORKS parameter should all 
   be a subset of the network to which the address in the parameter 
   SOURCE belongs. 
    
   Also for registrations at the country level there does exist the 
   same threat.  
    
   There for it is RECOMENDED to only allow registration of Tunnel 
   Servers for a given country if the Tunnel Server provides (via HTTP 
   authentication mechanism) a valid login and password for that 
   country. The person willing to deploy Tunnel Servers for a given 
   country should send an Email with contact information towards the 
   administrator of the Tunnel Database System. The Tunnel Database 
   Administrator can then decide to give a login and password or to 
   decline this request.
