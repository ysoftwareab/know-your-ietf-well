1.  Introduction

   The YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to
   model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and
   notifications for network management protocols.  The YANG language
   supports a small set of built-in data types and provides mechanisms
   to derive other types from the built-in types.

   This document introduces a collection of common data types derived
   from the built-in YANG data types.  The derived types are designed to
   be the common types applicable for modeling in the routing area.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

Internet-Draft             Routing Types YANG                   May 2017


2.  Overview

   This document defines the two models for common routing types, ietf-
   routing-types and iana-routing-types.  The only module imports are
   from [RFC6021].  The ietf-routing-types model contains common routing
   types other than those corresponding directly to IANA mappings.
   These include:

   router-id
      Router Identifiers are commonly used to identify a nodes in
      routing and other control plane protocols.  An example usage of
      router-id can be found in [I-D.ietf-ospf-yang].

   route-target
      Route Targets (RTs) are commonly used to control the distribution
      of virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) information, see
      [RFC4364], in support of virtual private networks (VPNs).  An
      example usage can be found in [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang].

   route-target-type
      This type defines the import and export rules of Route Targets, as
      descibed in Section 4.3.1 of [RFC4364].  An example usage can be
      found in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

   route-distinguisher
      Route Distinguishers (RDs) are commonly used to identify separate
      routes in support of virtual private networks (VPNs).  For
      example, in [RFC4364], RDs are commonly used to identify
      independent VPNs and VRFs, and more generally, to identify
      multiple routes to the same prefix.  An example usage can be found
      in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

   ipv4-multicast-group-address
      This type defines the representation of an IPv4 multicast group
      address, which is in the range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
      An example usage can be found in [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

   ipv6-multicast-group-address
      This type defines the representation of an IPv6 multicast group
      address, which is in the range of FF00::/8.  An example usage can
      be found in [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

   ip-multicast-group-address
      This type represents an IP multicast group address and is IP
      version neutral.  The format of the textual representation implies
      the IP version.  An example usage can be found in
      [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

Internet-Draft             Routing Types YANG                   May 2017


   ipv4-multicast-source-address
      IPv4 source address type for use in multicast control protocols.
      This type also allows the indication of wildcard sources, i.e.,
      "*".  An example of where this type may/will be used is
      [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

   ipv6-multicast-source-address
      IPv6 source address type for use in multicast control protocols.
      This type also allows the indication of wildcard sources, i.e.,
      "*".  An example of where this type may/will be used is
      [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

   bandwidth-ieee-float32
      Bandwidth in IEEE 754 floating point 32-bit binary format
      [IEEE754].  Commonly used in Traffic Engineering control plane
      protocols.  An example of where this type may/will be used is
      [I-D.ietf-ospf-yang].

   link-access-type
      This type identifies the IGP link type.  An example of where this
      type may/will be used is [I-D.ietf-ospf-yang].

   timer-multiplier
      This type is used in conjunction with a timer-value type.  It is
      generally used to indicate define the number of timer-value
      intervals that may expire before a specific event must occur.
      Examples of this include the arrival of any BFD packets, see
      [RFC5880] Section 6.8.4, or hello_interval in [RFC3209].  Example
      of where this type may/will be used is [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model]
      and [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-rsvp].

   timer-value-seconds16
      This type covers timers which can be set in seconds, not set, or
      set to infinity.  This type supports a range of values that can be
      represented in a uint16 (2 octets).  An example of where this type
      may/will be used is [I-D.ietf-ospf-yang].

   timer-value-seconds32
      This type covers timers which can be set in seconds, not set, or
      set to infinity.  This type supports a range of values that can be
      represented in a uint32 (4 octets).  An example of where this type
      may/will be used is [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-rsvp].

   timer-value-milliseconds
      This type covers timers which can be set in milliseconds, not set,
      or set to infinity.  This type supports a range of values that can
      be represented in a uint32 (4 octets).  Examples of where this

      type may/will be used include [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-rsvp] and
      [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang].

   percentage
      This type defines a percentage with a range of 0-100%.  An example
      usage can be found in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

   timeticks64
      This type is based on the timeticks type defined in [RFC6991] but
      with 64-bit precision.  It represents the time in hundredths of a
      second between two epochs.  An example usage can be found in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

   generalized-label
      This type represents a generalized label for Generalized Multi-
      Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3471].  The Generalized Label
      does not identify its type, which is known from the context.  An
      example usage can be found in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].

   mpls-label-special-purpose
      This type represents the special-purpose Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) label values [RFC7274].  An example usage can be
      found in [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang].

   mpls-label-general-use
      The 20 bits label values in an MPLS label stack entry, specified
      in [RFC3032].  This label value does not include the encodings of
      Traffic Class and TTL (time to live).  The label range specified
      by this type is for general use, with special-purpose MPLS label
      values excluded.  An example usage can be found in
      [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang].

   mpls-label
      The 20 bits label values in an MPLS label stack entry, specified
      in [RFC3032].  This label value does not include the encodings of
      Traffic Class and TTL (time to live).  The label range specified
      by this type covers the general use values and the special-purpose
      label values.  An example usage can be found in
      [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang].

   This document defines the following YANG groupings:

   mpls-label-stack
      This grouping defines a reusable collection of schema nodes
      representing an MPLS label stack [RFC3032].  An example usage can
      be found in [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang].

      This grouping defines a reusable collection of schema nodes
      representing Route Target import-export rules used in the BGP
      enabled Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  [RFC4364][RFC4664].  An
      example usage can be found in [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang].

   The iana-routing-types model contains common routing types
   corresponding directly to IANA mappings.  These include:

   address-family
      This type defines values for use in address family identifiers.
      The values are based on the IANA Address Family Numbers Registry
      [IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-REGISTRY].  An example usage can be found in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

   subsequent-address-family
      This type defines values for use in subsequent address family
      (SAFI) identifiers.  The values are based on the IANA Subsequent
      Address Family Identifiers (SAFI) Parameters Registry
      [IANA-SAFI-REGISTRY].

5.1.  IANA-Maintained iana-routing-types Module

   This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
   iana-routing-types YANG module.

   The iana-routing-types YANG module is intended to reflect the
   "Address Family Numbers" registry [IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-REGISTRY] and
   "Subsequent Address Family Identifiers (SAFI) Parameters" registry
   [IANA-SAFI-REGISTRY].

Internet-Draft             Routing Types YANG                   May 2017


   IANA has added this notes to the "iana-routing-types YANG Module"
   registry:

      Address Families and Subsequent Address Families must not be
      directly added to the iana-routing-types YANG module.  They must
      instead be respectively added to the "Address Family Numbers"
      and "Subsequent Address Family Identifiers (SAFI) Parameters"
      registries.

   When an Address Family or Subsequent Address Family is respectively
   added to the "Address Family Numbers" registry or the "Subsequent
   Address Family Identifiers (SAFI) Parameters" registry, a new
   "identity" statement must be added to the iana-routing-types YANG
   module.  The name of the "identity" is the same as the corresponding
   address family or SAFI only it willl be a valid YANG identifier in
   all lowercase and with hyphens separating individual words in
   compound identifiers.  The following substatements to the "identity"
   statement should be defined:

      "base": Contains the value "address-family" for address families
              or "bgp-safi" for subsequent address families.

      "status": Include only if a registration has been deprecated (use
                the value "deprecated") or obsoleted (use the value
                "obsolete").

      "description": Replicate the description from the registry,
                     if any.  Insert line breaks as needed so that the
                     line does not exceed 72 characters.

      "reference": Replicate the reference from the registry, if any,
                   and add the title of the document.

   Unassigned or reserved values are not present in these modules.

   When the iana-routing-types YANG module is updated, a new "revision"
   statement must be added in front of the existing revision statements.

   IANA has added this new note to the the "Address Family Numbers" and
   "Subsequent Address Family Identifiers (SAFI) Parameters" registries:

         When this registry is modified, the YANG module
         iana-routing-types must be updated as defined in RFC XXXX.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines common data types using the YANG data modeling
   language.  The definitions themselves have no security impact on the
   Internet, but the usage of these definitions in concrete YANG modules
   might have.  The security considerations spelled out in the YANG
   specification [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.

7.  Acknowledgements

   The Routing Area Yang Architecture design team members included Acee
   Lindem, Anees Shaikh, Christian Hopps, Dean Bogdanovic, Ebben Aries,
   Lou Berger, Qin Wu, Rob Shakir, Xufeng Liu, and Yingzhen Qu.

   Thanks to Martin Bjorkland, Tom Petch, Stewart Bryant, and Radek
   Krejci for comments on the model and document text.
