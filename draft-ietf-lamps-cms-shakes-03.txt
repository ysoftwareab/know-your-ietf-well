2.  Introduction

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] is used to digitally
   sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt arbitrary message contents.
   This specification describes the use of the SHAKE128 and SHAKE256
   specified in [SHA3] as new hash functions in CMS.  In addition, it
   describes the use of these functions with the RSASSA-PSS signature
   algorithm [RFC8017] and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) [X9.62] with the CMS signed-data content type.

   In the SHA-3 family, two extendable-output functions (SHAKEs),
   SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, are defined.  Four other hash function
   instances, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 are also
   defined but are out of scope for this document.  A SHAKE is a
   variable length hash function.  The output length, in bits, of a
   SHAKE is defined by the d parameter.  The corresponding collision and
   second preimage resistance strengths for SHAKE128 are min(d/2,128)
   and min(d,128) bits respectively.  And, the corresponding collision
   and second preimage resistance strengths for SHAKE256 are
   min(d/2,256) and min(d,256) bits respectively.

   A SHAKE can be used in CMS as the message digest function (to hash
   the message to be signed) in RSASSA-PSS and deterministic ECDSA,

   message authentication code and as the mask generating function in
   RSASSA-PSS.  This specification describes the identifiers for SHAKEs
   to be used in CMS and their meaning.

2.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Identifiers

   This section defines six new OIDs for using SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 in
   CMS.

   EDNOTE: If PKIX draft is standardized first maybe we should not say
   the identifiers are new for the RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA.

   Two object identifiers for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 hash functions are
   defined in [shake-nist-oids] and we include them here for
   convenience.

     id-shake128-len OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
          country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
          nistAlgorithm(4) 2 17 }

     id-shake256-len OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
          country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
          nistAlgorithm(4) 2 18 }

   In this specification, when using the id-shake128-len or id-
   shake256-len algorithm identifiers, the parameters MUST be absent.
   That is, the identifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, the
   OID.

   We define two new identifiers for RSASSA-PSS signatures using SHAKEs.

     id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { TBD }

     id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { TBD }

     [ EDNOTE: "TBD" will be specified by NIST later. ]

   The same RSASSA-PSS algorithm identifiers can be used for identifying
   public keys and signatures.

   We define two new algorithm identifiers of ECDSA signatures using
   SHAKEs.

     id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
         country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
         nistAlgorithm(4) 3  TBD }

     id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)

         nistAlgorithm(4) 3  TBD }

     [ EDNOTE: "TBD" will be specified by NIST. ]

   The parameters for the four RSASSA-PSS and deterministic ECDSA
   identifiers MUST be absent.  That is, each identifier SHALL be a
   SEQUENCE of one component, the OID.

   Two new object identifiers for KMACs using SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are
   define elow.

      id-KmacWithSHAKE128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
          country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
          nistAlgorithm(4) 2 19 }

      id-KmacWithSHAKE256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
          country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
          nistAlgorithm(4) 2 20 }

   The parameters for id-KmacWithSHAKE128 and id-KmacWithSHAKE256 MUST
   be absent.  That is, each identifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one
   component, the OID.

   Section 4.1, Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.4 specify the
   required output length for each use of SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 in
   message digests, RSASSA-PSS, determinstic ECDSA and KMAC.

4.  Use in CMS

4.1.  Message Digests

   The id-shake128-len and id-shake256-len OIDs (Section 3) can be used
   as the digest algorithm identifiers located in the SignedData,
   SignerInfo, DigestedData, and the AuthenticatedData digestAlgorithm
   fields in CMS [RFC5652].  The encoding MUST omit the parameters field
   and the output size, d, for the SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 message digest
   MUST be 256 or 512 bits respectively.

   The digest values are located in the DigestedData field and the
   Message Digest authenticated attribute included in the
   signedAttributes of the SignedData signerInfo.  In addition, digest

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                November 2018


   values are input to signature algorithms.  The digest algorithm MUST
   be the same as the message hash algorithms used in signatures.

4.2.  Signatures

   In CMS, signature algorithm identifiers are located in the SignerInfo
   signatureAlgorithm field of SignedData content type and
   countersignature attribute.  Signature values are located in the
   SignerInfo signature field of SignedData and countersignature.

   Conforming implementations that process RSASSA-PSS and deterministic
   ECDSA with SHAKE signatures when processing CMS data MUST recognize
   the corresponding OIDs specified in Section 3.

4.2.1.  RSASSA-PSS Signatures

   The RSASSA-PSS algorithm is defined in [RFC8017].  When id-RSASSA-
   PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256 specified in Section 3 is
   used, the encoding MUST omit the parameters field.  That is, the
   AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, id-RSASSA-
   PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256.

   The hash algorithm to hash a message being signed and the hash and
   the hash algorithm as the mask generation function used in RSASSA-PSS
   MUST be the same, SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 respectively.  The output-
   length of the hash algorithm which hashes the message SHALL be 32 or
   64 bytes respectively.

   The mask generation function takes an octet string of variable length
   and a desired output length as input, and outputs an octet string of
   the desired length.  In RSASSA-PSS with SHAKES, the SHAKEs MUST be
   used natively as the MGF function, instead of the MGF1 algorithm that
   uses the hash function in multiple iterations as specified in
   Section B.2.1 of [RFC8017].  In other words, the MGF is defined as
   the SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 output of the mgfSeed for id-RSASSA-PSS-
   SHAKE128 and id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256 respectively.  The mgfSeed is the
   seed from which mask is generated, an octet string [RFC8017].  The
   output length is (n - 264)/8 or (n - 520)/8 bytes respectively, where
   n is the RSA modulus in bits.  For example, when RSA modulus n is
   2048, the output length of SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 as the MGF will be
   223 or 191-bits when id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256
   is used respectively.

   The RSASSA-PSS saltLength MUST be 32 or 64 bytes respectively.
   Finally, the trailerField MUST be 1, which represents the trailer
   field with hexadecimal value 0xBC [RFC8017].

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                November 2018


4.2.2.  Deterministic ECDSA Signatures

   The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is defined in
   [X9.62].  When the id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE128 or id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE256
   (specified in Section 3) algorithm identifier appears, the respective
   SHAKE function is used as the hash.  The encoding MUST omit the
   parameters field.  That is, the AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a
   SEQUENCE of one component, the OID id-ecdsa-with-SHAKE128 or id-
   ecdsa-with-SHAKE256.

   For simplicity and compliance with the ECDSA standard specification,
   the output size of the hash function must be explicitly determined.
   The output size, d, for SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 used in ECDSA MUST be
   256 or 512 bits respectively.

   Conforming implementations that generate ECDSA with SHAKE signatures
   in CMS MUST generate such signatures with a deterministicly
   generated, non-random k in accordance with all the requirements
   specified in [RFC6979].  They MAY also generate such signatures in
   accordance with all other recommendations in [X9.62] or [SEC1] if
   they have a stated policy that requires conformance to these
   standards.

4.3.  Public Keys

   In CMS, the signer's public key algorithm identifiers are located in
   the OriginatorPublicKey's algorithm attribute.

   Conforming implementations MUST specify the algorithms explicitly by
   using the OIDs specified in Section 3 when encoding RSASSA-PSS and
   ECDSA with SHAKE public keys in CMS messages.  The conventions for
   RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA public keys algorithm identifiers are as
   specified in [RFC3279], [RFC4055] and [RFC5480] , but we include them
   below for convenience.

4.3.1.  RSASSA-PSS Public Keys

   [RFC3279] defines the following OID for RSA AlgorithmIdentifier in
   the SubjectPublicKeyInfo with NULL parameters.

     rsaEncryption OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { pkcs-1 1}

   Additionally, when the RSA private key owner wishes to limit the use
   of the public key exclusively to RSASSA-PSS, the AlgorithmIdentifier
   for RSASSA-PSS defined in Section 3 can be used as the algorithm
   attribute in the OriginatorPublicKey sequence.  The identifier
   parameters, as explained in Section 3, MUST be absent.  The RSASSA-

   PSS algorithm functions and output lengths are the same as defined in
   Section 4.2.1.

   Regardless of what public key algorithm identifier is used, the RSA
   public key, which is composed of a modulus and a public exponent,
   MUST be encoded using the RSAPublicKey type [RFC4055].  The output of
   this encoding is carried in the CMS publicKey bit string.

     RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
           modulus INTEGER, -- n
           publicExponent INTEGER  -- e
     }

4.3.2.  ECDSA Public Keys

   For ECDSA, the mandatory EC SubjectPublicKey is defined in
   Section 2.1.1 and its syntax in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].  We also
   include them here for convenience:

      id-ecPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
          iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) keyType(2) 1 }

      ECParameters ::= CHOICE {
          namedCurve         OBJECT IDENTIFIER
          -- implicitCurve   NULL
          -- specifiedCurve  SpecifiedECDomain
          }

   The ECParameters associated with the ECDSA public key in the signers
   certificate SHALL apply to the verification of the signature.

4.4.  Message Authentication Codes

   KMAC message authentication code (KMAC) is specified in [SP800-185].
   In CMS, KMAC algorithm identifiers are located in the
   AuthenticatedData macAlgorithm field.  The KMAC values are located in
   the AuthenticatedData mac field.

   When the id-KmacWithSHAKE128 or id-KmacWithSHAKE256 algorithm
   identifier is used as the MAC algorithm identifier, the parameters
   field is optional (absent or present).  If absent, the SHAKE256
   output length used in KMAC is 256 or 512 bits respectively and the
   customization string is an empty string by default.

   Conforming implementations that process KMACs with the SHAKEs when
   processing CMS data MUST recognize these identifiers.

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                November 2018


   When calculating the KMAC output, the variable N is 0xD2B282C2, S is
   an empty string, and L, the integer representing the requested output
   length in bits, is 256 or 512 for KmacWithSHAKE128 or
   KmacWithSHAKE256 respectively in this specification.

5.  IANA Considerations

   [ EDNOTE: Update here only if there are OID allocations by IANA. ]

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   The SHAKEs are deterministic functions.  Like any other deterministic
   function, executing each function with the same input multiple times
   will produce the same output.  Therefore, users should not expect
   unrelated outputs (with the same or different output lengths) from
   excuting a SHAKE function with the same input multiple times.  The
   shorter one of any 2 outputs produced from a SHAKE with the same
   input is a prefix of the longer one.  It is a similar situation as
   truncating a 512-bit output of SHA-512 by taking its 256 left-most
   bits.  These 256 left-most bits are a prefix of the 512-bit output.

   Implementations must protect the signer's private key.  Compromise of
   the signer's private key permits masquerade.

   When more than two parties share the same message-authentication key,
   data origin authentication is not provided.  Any party that knows the
   message-authentication key can compute a valid MAC, therefore the
   content could originate from any one of the parties.

   Implementers should be aware that cryptographic algorithms may become
   weaker with time.  As new cryptanalysis techniques are developed and
   computing power increases, the work factor or time required to break
   a particular cryptographic algorithm may decrease.  Therefore,
   cryptographic algorithm implementations should be modular allowing
   new algorithms to be readily inserted.  That is, implementers should
   be prepared to regularly update the set of algorithms in their
   implementations.
