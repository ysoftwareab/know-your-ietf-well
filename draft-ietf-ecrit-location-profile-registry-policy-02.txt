           Changing the LoST Location Profile Registry Policy
          draft-ietf-ecrit-location-profile-registry-policy-02

Abstract

   This document changes the policy of the Location-to-Service
   Translation (LoST) Location Profile IANA registry established by
   RFC5222 from Standards Action to Specification Required.  This allows
   standards development organizations (SDOs) other than the IETF to add
   new values.

1.  Document Scope

   This document changes the policy of the Location-to-Service
   Translation (LoST) Location Profile IANA registry [reg] established
   by [RFC5222] from Standards Action to Specification Required (as
   defined in [RFC8126]).  This allows standards development
   organizations (SDOs) other than the IETF to add new values.

2.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol, LoST [RFC5222] uses a
   location profile when conveying location (e.g., in a mapping request
   and a service boundary result).  [RFC5222] established an IANA
   registry of location profiles [reg], with a registry policy of
   Standards Action.  This requires a standards-track RFC for any new
   registry values.  The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) is
   an SDO that makes significant use of LoST in its emergency call
   specifications (e.g., [NENA-i3]) and has identified a need for
   additional location profiles.  This document changes the registry
   policy to Specification Required, allowing other SDOs such as NENA to
   add values.

3.  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are identified by this change in
   registry policy.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to change the policy of the Location-to-Service
   Translation (LoST) Location Profile Registry (established by
   [RFC5222]) to Specification Required.  The expert reviewer is
   designated per [RFC8126].  The reviewer should verify that:

   o  the proposed new value is specified by the IETF, NENA, or a
      similar SDO in which location profiles are in scope;
   o  the proposed new value has a clear need (which includes there not
      being an existing profile that meets the need);
   o  the profile specification is unambiguous and interoperable.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Ted Hardie for his helpful review and suggestions, and
   to Guy Caron for his suggestion to clarify that "clear need" includes
   there not being an existing profile.
