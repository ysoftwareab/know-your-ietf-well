1.  Introduction

   Many modern mail clients display small extracts of the body text as
   an aid to allow a user to quickly decide whether they are interested
   in viewing the full message contents.  Mail clients implementing the
   Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501] would benefit from a
   standardized, consistent way to generate these brief textual previews
   of messages.

   Generation of a preview on the server has several benefits.  First,
   it allows consistent representation of previews across all clients.
   This standardized display can reduce user confusion when using
   multiple clients, as abbreviated message representations in clients
   will show identical message contents.

   Second, server-side preview generation is more efficient.  A client-
   based algorithm needs to issue, at a minimum, a FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE
   command in order to determine which MIME [RFC2045] body part(s)
   should be represented in the preview.  Subsequently, at least one
   FETCH BODY command may be needed to retrieve body data used in
   preview generation.  These FETCH commands cannot be pipelined since
   the BODYSTRUCTURE query must be parsed on the client before the list
   of parts to be retrieved via the BODY command(s) can be determined.

Internet-Draft           IMAP: PREVIEW Extension          September 2020


   Additionally, it may be difficult to predict the amount of body data
   that must be retrieved to adequately represent the part via a
   preview, therefore requiring inefficient fetching of excessive data
   in order to account for this uncertainty.  For example, a preview
   algorithm to display data contained in a text/html [RFC2854] part
   will likely strip the markup tags to obtain textual content.
   However, without fetching the entire content of the part, there is no
   way to guarantee that sufficient non-tag content will exist unless
   either 1) the entire part is retrieved or 2) an additional partial
   FETCH is executed when the client determines that it does not possess
   sufficient data from a previous partial FETCH to display an adequate
   representation of the preview.

   Finally, server generation allows caching in a centralized location.
   Using server-generated previews allows global generation once per
   message, and that preview can be cached for the retention period of
   the source message.  Retrieval of message data may be expensive
   within a server, for example, so a server can be configured to reduce
   its storage retrieval load by pre-generating preview data.

   A server indicates support for this extension via the "PREVIEW"
   capability name.

2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   "User" is used to refer to a human user, whereas "client" refers to
   the software being run by the user.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

   As with all IMAP extension documents, the case used in writing IMAP
   protocol elements herein is chosen for editorial clarity, and
   implementations must pay attention to the numbered rules at the
   beginning of [RFC3501] Section 9.

3.  FETCH Data Item

3.1.  Command

   To retrieve a preview for a message, the "PREVIEW" FETCH attribute is
   used when issuing a FETCH command.

3.2.  Response

   The server returns a variable-length string that is the generated
   preview for that message.  This string is intended to be viewed by
   the user as a contextual preview of the entire message, and is not
   intended to be interpreted in any way by the client software.

   Example: Retrieving preview information in a SELECTed mailbox

     C: A1 FETCH 1 (PREVIEW)
     S: * 1 FETCH (PREVIEW "Preview text!")
     S: A1 OK FETCH complete.

   A server SHOULD strive to generate the same string for a given
   message for each request.  However, since previews are understood to
   be an approximation of the message data and not a canonical view of
   its contents, a client MUST NOT assume that a message preview is
   immutable for a given message.  This relaxed requirement permits a
   server to offer previews as an option without requiring potentially
   burdensome storage and/or processing requirements to guarantee
   immutability for a use case that does not require this strictness.
   For example, the underlying IMAP server may change due to a system
   software upgrade; an account's state information may be retained in
   the migration but the new server may generate different PREVIEW text
   than the old server.

   It is possible that the server has determined that no meaningful
   preview text can be generated for a particular message.  Examples of
   this involve encrypted messages, content types the server does not
   support previews of, and other situations where the server is not
   able to extract information for a preview.  In such cases, the server
   MUST return a zero-length string.  Clients SHOULD NOT send another
   FETCH for a preview for such messages.  (As discussed previously,
   preview data is not immutable so there is chance that at some point
   in the future the server would be able to generate meaningful text.
   However, this scenario is expected to be rare so a client should not
   continually send out requests to try to capture this infrequent
   occurrence.)

   If the LAZY modifier is used, the server MAY return NIL for the
   preview response, indicating that preview generation could not be

Internet-Draft           IMAP: PREVIEW Extension          September 2020


   completed without causing undue delay.  A server MUST NOT return NIL
   to a FETCH PREVIEW request made without the LAZY modifier.

3.3.  Preview Text Format

   The generated preview text MUST be treated as text/plain [RFC2046]
   media type data by the client.

   The generated string MUST NOT be content transfer encoded and MUST be
   encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  The server SHOULD remove any formatting
   markup and do whatever processing might be useful in rendering the
   preview as plain text.

   For purposes of this section, a "preview character" is defined as a
   single UCS character encoded in UTF-8.  Note: a single preview
   character may compromise multiple octets, so any buffers implemented
   to conform to the string limitations identified in this document
   should be sized to prevent possible overflow errors.

   The server SHOULD limit the length of the preview text to 200 preview
   characters.  This length should provide sufficient data to generally
   support both various languages (and their different average word
   lengths) and diverse client display size requirements.

   The server MUST NOT output preview text longer than 256 preview
   characters.

   If the preview is not generated based on the body content of the
   message, and the LANGUAGE [RFC5255] extension is supported by the
   server, the preview text SHOULD be generated according to the
   language rules that apply to human-readable text.  For example, a
   message that consists of a single image MIME part has no human-
   readable text from which to generate preview information.  Instead,
   the server may wish to output a description that the message contains
   an image and describe some attributes of the image, such as image
   format, size, and filename.  This descriptive text is not a product
   of the message body itself but is rather auto-generated data by the
   server, and should thus use the rules defined for human-readable text
   described in the LANGUAGE extension (if supported on the server).

4.  LAZY Priority Modifier

4.1.  LAZY

   The LAZY modifier directs the server to return the preview
   representation only if that data can be returned without undue delay
   to the client.

Internet-Draft           IMAP: PREVIEW Extension          September 2020


   If this modifier is used, and the server is unable to return preview
   data without undue delay, the server MUST return NIL as the preview
   response.

   The LAZY modifier MUST be implemented by any server that supports the
   PREVIEW extension.

4.2.  Client Implementation Advice

   Upon opening a mailbox, a client generally performs a FETCH of
   message details in order to create a listing to present to the user
   (e.g.  ENVELOPE data).  Using this extension, a client may want to
   additionally display preview information as part of this listing.
   Quickly providing the base mailbox listing, with basic message
   details, is the primary goal of this command as this is required to
   allow the user to begin interacting with the mailbox.  Preview data
   is likely to be of secondary importance; it provides useful context,
   but it is not necessary to perform message actions.  A client can
   load unavailable previews in the background and display them
   asynchronously to the user as the preview data is provided by the
   server.

   In this scenario, the client would add the PREVIEW data item, with
   the LAZY modifier, to the list of FETCH items needed to generate the
   mailbox listing.  This allows the server to advantageously return
   preview data without blocking the primary goal of quickly returning
   the basic message details used to generate the mailbox listing.

   Once this initial FETCH is complete, the client can then issue FETCH
   requests, without the LAZY modifier, to load the PREVIEW data item
   for the messages in which preview data was not returned.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that these FETCH requests be issued in small batches,
   e.g., 50 messages per FETCH command, since preview generation may be
   expensive and a single large request may exceed server resource
   limits.

   See Example 2 for an implementation of this strategy.

   A client SHOULD NOT continually issue LAZY PREVIEW FETCH commands in
   a selected mailbox as the server is under no requirement to return
   preview information for this command, which could lead to an
   unnecessary waste of system and network resources.

   Example 3: Retrieve preview information for search results within a
   single mailbox.  Use SEARCHRES [RFC5182] extension to save a round-
   trip.

     C: E1 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 PREVIEW SEARCHRES

     C: E4 UID FETCH 23 (PREVIEW)
     S: * 9 FETCH (UID 23 PREVIEW "Another preview!")
     S: E4 OK FETCH completed.

6.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in ABNF [RFC5234].  It includes definitions
   from IMAP [RFC3501].

     capability        =/ "PREVIEW"

     fetch-att         =/ "PREVIEW" [SP "(" preview-mod *(SP
                          preview-mod) ")"]

     msg-att-dynamic   =/ "PREVIEW" SP nstring

     preview-mod       =  "LAZY"

7.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 [RFC3501] capabilities are registered by publishing a standards
   track or IESG-approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently
   located at:

      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-capabilities

   This document requests that IANA adds the "PREVIEW" capability to the
   IMAP4 [RFC3501] capabilities registry.

8.  Security Considerations

   Implementation of this extension might enable denial-of-service
   attacks against server resources, due to excessive memory or CPU
   usage during preview generation or increased storage usage if preview
   results are stored on the server after generation.  In order to
   mitigate such attacks, servers SHOULD log the client authentication
   identity on FETCH PREVIEW operations in order to facilitate tracking
   of abusive clients.

   Servers MAY limit the resources that preview generation uses.  Such
   resource limitations might, in an extreme example, cause a server to
   return a preview that is the empty string for a message that
   otherwise would have had a non-empty preview.  However, it is
   recommended that at least some preview text be provided in this
   situation, even if the quality of the preview is degraded.

   Just as the messages they summarize, preview data may contain
   sensitive information.  If generated preview data is stored on the
   server, e.g. for caching purposes, these previews MUST be protected
   with equivalent authorization and confidentiality controls as the
   source message.

   o  Added DoS attack info to security considerations

   o  Distinguish between NIL response and zero-length string

   o  Don't use deprecated "X-" convention in example

   o  Spelling and nits

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-01:

   o  Fix capability ABNF

   o  Removed CAPABILITY string for examples where it did not add
      valuable context

   o  Altered preview data in examples to cover a variety of potential
      server return scenarios

   o  Added "SHOULD be registered" language to algorithm names and
      priority modifiers

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-02:

Internet-Draft           IMAP: PREVIEW Extension          September 2020


   o  Move Acknowledgments to un-numbered appendix

   o  Improved abstract text

   o  Consistently use "priority modifiers" instead of "modifiers"

   o  Update example to conform with RFC 3501 UID FETCH requirements

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-03:

   o  Remove preview modifier registry request

   o  Improve instructions for registration of algorithms

   o  Add storage information to security considerations

   o  Clarify parsing of algorithm list in FETCH command

   o  Clarify difference between NIL response and zero-length string

   o  Add normative reference for text/plain

   o  Add warning regarding buffers and multiple octet preview
      characters

   o  Clarify how to handle preview data return when using an explicit
      algorithm list

   o  Various editorial fixes

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-04:

   o  Make clear that preview caching is tied to retention period of the
      source message

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-05:

   o  Clarify "zero-length string" preview data vs. NIL preview data

   o  MIME data -> media type

   o  Capability registration should not include the algorithm name

   o  Give example of how PREVIEW data might change over time

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-06:

   o  Change algorithm names to media types

Internet-Draft           IMAP: PREVIEW Extension          September 2020


   o  FUZZY algorithm changed to text/imap-fetch-preview

   o  Remove server broadcast of PREVIEW algorithm extensions from
      capability

   o  Default, fallback algorithm in absence of client selection now
      MUST be text/imap-fetch-preview

   o  LAZY modifier should work on default algorithm if no specific
      algorithm is provided as an argument

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-07:

   o  Remove algorithm selection; PREVIEW always returns text in format
      defined in Section 3.3

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-08:

   o  FETCH PREVIEW without LAZY modifier MUST NOT return NIL

   o  Improve client implementation advice for LAZY modifier

   Changes from draft-ietf-extra-imap-fetch-preview-09:

   o  Clarified that string response is to be interpreted by user, not
      the client

   o  Give example behavior of resource limitation

   o  Various editorial fixes
