JAVA LDAP CONTROLS                                        November, 1997



1. Introduction

   Version 3 of the LDAP protocol provides a means of supplying
   arbitrary additional information along with a request to an LDAP
   server, and receiving arbitrary additional response information. A
   few applications of the Control mechanism have been identified as
   having general interest, and the protocol defined for their
   transmission [5] and [6]. This document defines how support for the
   Preferred Language Control, the Server Sorting Control, the Virtual
   List Control, and the Persistent Search Control are supported
   in the java LDAP API. The java LDAP API in general is described in
   [2]. The Control protocol extension is described in [1], section
   4.1.12, and applications of it in [5] and [6].


2. Overview of the LDAP Control classes

   LDAPControl is part of a basic LDAP class package. Specific
   applications/implementations of Controls are in a subpackage called
   "controls".

   The base class LDAPControl is defined in [2] as:

      public class LDAPControl implements Cloneable

      An LDAPControl encapsulates optional additional parameters or
      constraints to be applied to LDAP operations. If set as a Server
      Control, it is sent to the server along with operation requests.
      If set as a Client Control, it is not sent to the server, but
      rather interpreted locally by the client. LDAPControl is an
      LDAPv3 extension, and is not supported in an LDAPv2 environment.

      Constructors

         public LDAPControl(String id,
                            boolean critical,
                            byte vals[])

         Parameters are:

         id           The type of the Control, as a string.

         critical     True if the LDAP operation should be discarded if
                      the server does not support this Control.

         vals         Control-specific data.

      getID

         public String getID()

JAVA LDAP CONTROLS                                        November, 1997


         Returns the identifier of the control.

      isCritical

         public boolean isCritical()

         Returns true if the control must be supported for an
         associated operation to be executed.

      getValue

         public byte[] getValue()

         Returns the control-specific data of the object.


   The following Controls are defined for the controls subpackage:


   LDAPVirtualListControl    Encapsulates requests for a subset of a
                             virtual list of search results, and the
                             response of a server to such a request.


   LDAPSortControl           Encapsulates a requested sorting order for
                             search results returned by a server, and
                             the server's response to the request.

   LDAPPersistSearchControl  Used to start a persistent search, one
                             which runs continuously, returning results
                             as the Directory is modified.


3. The java LDAP Control classes


3.1 public class LDAPVirtualListControl
                 extends LDAPControl

   LDAPVirtualListControl is a Server Control to specify that results
   from a search are to be returned in pages, subsets of the entire
   virtual result set. On success, an updated LDAPVirtualList object is
   returned as a response Control, containing information on the virtual
   list size and the actual first index. This object can then be updated
   by the client with a new requested position or length and sent to the
   server to obtain a different segment of the virtual list. The
   protocol elements are defined in [6].


3.1.1 Constructors

   public LDAPVirtualListControl( String jumpTo,

Expires 5/98                                                  [Page 4]

JAVA LDAP CONTROLS                                        November, 1997


                                  int beforeCount,
                                  int afterCount )

   Constructs a virtual list control using the specified filter
   expression for the first entry, which defines the extent of the
   virtual search results, and the number of entries before and after a
   located index to be returned.

   public LDAPVirtualListControl( int startIndex,
                                  int beforeCount,
                                  int afterCount,
                                  int contentCount)

   Use this constructor when the size of the virtual list is known, to
   fetch a subset.

   Parameters are:

      jumpTo         A search expression that defines the first
                      element to be returned in the virtual search
                      results. The filter expression in the search
                      operation itself may be, for example,
                      "objectclass=person" and the jumpTo expression in
                      the virtual list control may be "cn=m*", to
                      retrieve a subset of entries starting at or
                      centered around those with a common name
                      beginning with the letter "M".

      beforeCount    The number of entries before startIndex (the
                      reference entry) to be returned.

      afterCount     The number of entries after startIndex to be
                      returned.

      startIndex     The index of the reference entry to be returned.

      contentCount   The total number of entries assumed to be in the
                      list. This is a number returned on a previous
                      search, in the LDAPVirtualListResponse. The
                      server may use this number to adjust the returned
                      subset offset.


3.1.2 getAfterCount

   public int getAfterCount()

   Returns the number of entries after the top/center one to return per
   page of results.

JAVA LDAP CONTROLS                                        November, 1997


3.1.3 getBeforeCount

   public int getBeforeCount()

   Returns the number of entries before the top/center one to return per
   page of results.


3.1.4 getListSize

   public int getListSize()

   Returns the size of the virtual search results list. For a newly
   constructed control - one which is not the result of parseResponse on
   a control returned by a server - the method returns -1.


3.1.5 setListSize

   public void setListSize( int size )

   Sets the assumed size of the virtual search results list. This will
   typically be a number returned on a previous virtual list request in
   an LDAPVirtualListResponse.


3.1.6 setRange

   public void setRange( int listIndex,
                         int beforeCount,
                         int afterCount )

   Sets the center or starting list index to return, and the number of
   results before and after.

   Parameters are:

      listIndex      The center or starting list index to be returned.

      beforeCount    The number of entries before "listIndex" to be
                      returned.

      afterCount     The number of entries after "listIndex" to be
                      returned.


3.2 public class LDAPVirtualListResponse
                 extends LDAPControl

   LDAPVirtualListResponse is a Server Control returned by the server in
   response to a virtual list search request.

JAVA LDAP CONTROLS                                        November, 1997



3.2.1 getContentCount

   public int getContentCount ()

   Returns the size of the virtual search results list


3.2.2 getFirstPosition

   public int getFirstPosition ()

   Returns the index of the first entry returned


3.2.3 getResultCode

   public int getResultCode ()

   Returns the result code for the virtual list request


3.2.4 parseResponse

   public static LDAPVirtualListResponse parseResponse(
                                        LDAPControl[] controls )

   When applied to an array of controls returned by a server,
   parseResponse returns a virtual list response. The input is typically
   provided with the LDAPConnection.getResponseControls method.

   Parameters are:

      controls       An array of controls. It may be null.



3.3 public class LDAPSortControl
                 extends LDAPControl

   LDAPSortControl is a Server Control to specify how search results are
   to be sorted by the server (see [5]). If a server does not support
   sorting in general or for a particular query, the results will be
   returned unsorted, along with a control indicating why they were not
   sorted (or that sort controls are not supported). If the control was
   marked "critical", the whole search operation will fail if the sort
   control is not supported.


3.3.1 Constructors

   public LDAPSortControl( LDAPSortKey key, boolean critical)

JAVA LDAP CONTROLS                                        November, 1997



   Constructs a sort control with a single key.


   public LDAPSortControl( LDAPSortKey[] keys, boolean critical)

   Constructs a sort control with multiple sort keys.

   Parameters are:

      key            A sort key object, which specifies attribute,
                      order, and optional matching rule.

      keys           An array of sort key objects, to be processed in
                      order.

      critical       True if the search operation is to fail if the
                      server does not support this control.


3.3.2 parseResponse

   public static String parseResponse( LDAPControl[] controls,
                                       int results[] )

   Processes an array of Server Controls to determine if sorting was
   rejected, and if so, why. If sorting was rejected, the return value
   is the attribute name which caused sorting to fail. results[0]
   contains the result code on return. The result code is one defined in
   [1], section 4.1.10.

   Parameters are:

      controls       An array of Server Controls, typically obtained
                      with LDAPConnection.getResponseControls(). It may
                      be null, which is equivalent to no error.


3.4 public class LDAPPersistSearchControl
                 extends LDAPControl

   The LDAPPersistSearchControl class is used to start a persistent
   search, one that doesn't end after returning any initial results, but
   continues to monitor changes in a designated part of a Directory,
   reporting the results as changes are made. The protocol elements are
   defined in [9].

3.4.1 Constructors

   public LDAPPersistSearchControl(int changeTypes,
                                   boolean changesOnly,
                                   boolean returnControls,

      changesOnly    true if the initial search is to be skipped.

      returnControls true if entry change controls are to be returned
                      with the search results.

      isCritical     true if the search is to be abandoned if the
                      server doesn't support this control.

3.4.2 getChangeTypes

   public int getChangeTypes()

   Returns the change types to be monitored as a logical OR of any or
   all of these types: ADD, DELETE, MODIFY, and/or MODDN.


3.4.3 public boolean getReturnControls()

   search results.


3.4.4 setChangeTypes

   public void setChangeTypes(int types)

   Sets change types to be monitored.

   Parameters are:

      types          The change types to be monitored as a logical OR
                      of any or all of these types: ADD, DELETE,
                      MODIFY, and/or MODDN.
