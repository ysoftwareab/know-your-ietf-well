1. Introduction 
    
   As IPv4 and IPv6 protocols become increasingly the predominant 
   protocol used in all networking communication, so does the need to 
   compress these headers before they are transmitted over a congested 
   link. This is especially true for short payloads.  These headers 
   often contain redundant values for the majority of the fields and 
   those fields that are not redundant can be predicted or are small in 
   size. This is even more essential when the last network hop is a 
   wireless connection, due to the wasted power and bandwidth for 
   wireless transmission of these headers for each packet.  By using 
   header compression, the bandwidth is increased and the wasted power 
   for those transmissions is significantly reduced. 
    
   Robust Header Compression (ROHC) as defined in RFC3095 [2] is 
   intended to be used for compression of IPv4, IPv6 datagrams and/or 
   packets encapsulated with multiple IP headers.  In the past ROHC has 
   been intended to be used for Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN).  
   These networks have limited bandwidth and high Bit Error Rates (BER), 
   which require a header compression algorithm for more efficient 
   operation.  This purpose of this draft is to allow ROHC to be used 
   for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) and Wireless Personal Area 
   Networks (WPAN).  WLANs and WPANs also operate with high BER that are 
   typically in the range of 10^-5 to 10^-6 and are significantly higher 
   than traditional wired networks.  The BER for WLAN and WPAN becomes 
   increasingly worse with common interference, such as other wireless 
   transmitter in the same frequency, multi-path fading, and other

   interferers.  Similar to WWAN, these networks are also limited in 
   bandwidth, which is shared among its users.  As WLANs and WPANs 
   become more and more popular, the average bandwidth per user 
   continues to decrease.  But with the use of ROHC, the bandwidth on 
   these wireless networks is used more efficiently and provides 
   additional capacity for these wireless networks.  
    
   For Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in WLAN and WPAN, the use of 
   ROHC is essentials due to the large networking protocol overhead.  
   Without the use of ROHC, up to 75% of the network data exchange is 
   used to exchange network protocol headers (Assumes G.729 which uses 
   20 bytes voice sample, with network protocol header of IPv6 (40 
   bytes)/UDP(8 bytes)/RTP(12 bytes).  With ROHC, typical network 
   protocol header overhead can be reduced to less then 10%.  Unlike 
   Ethernet, WLAN and WPAN do not have minimum packet sizes and 
   therefore do not have additional padding bytes appended during 
   transmission for small packets. 
    
   The solution that is proposed in this draft will allow these current 
   and future "Ethernet-like" networks to use ROHC, by providing a Layer 
   2 mapping to support ROHC.  The solution described in the draft 
   consists of defining a new Ethernet type and a simple protocol, which 
   will be contained in the Ethernet payload, to support transporting 
   ROHC packets over Wireless Media is described in section 3. 
    
    
2. Terminology  
    
   "Ethernet-like" 
    
      Any Layer 2 protocol, which provides a Media Access Control (MAC) 
     protocol or an adaptation layer, designed supports the 
     transportation of Ethernet packets over a physical media.  Examples 
     are IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.11, and IEEE 802.15.1. 
    
   Channels 
    
      Robust header compression RFC, RFC3095 [2], provides a definition 
     for channels.  For ROHCoWEM, only one channel exists between a pair 
     of nodes that are connected via a wireless or fixed link.  Each 
     channel can have different characteristics in terms of error rate, 
     bandwidth, etc. Each channel between two nodes is unique due to the
     unique link layer 2 address assigned to each end node.  For 
     example, the channel that exists between two IEEE 802.11 devices 
     connected via a wireless link can be uniquely identified by knowing 
     the IEEE Address of both of the devices and the protocol type 
     field.

   Context Identifiers (CID)s  
     Robust header compression RFC, RFC3095 [2], provides a definition 
     for context identifiers.  For ROHCoWEM, there may be one or more 
     CIDs on a channel but for that channel each CID defines an unique 
     context identifier for data exchanged over that channel. 
    
   Sharing Context Identifier Space 
        For the compression and decompression of IPv4 and IPv6 datagram   
     headers, the context identifier space is shared for each channel 
     existing between a pair of nodes.  While the parameter values are 
     independently negotiated, sharing the context identifier spaces 
     becomes more complex when the parameter values differ.  Since the 
     compressed packets share context identifier space, the compression 
     engine must allocate context identifiers out of a common pool; for 
     compressed packets, the decompressor has to examine the context 
     state to determine what parameters to use for decompression. "

   transport ROHC packets over Ethernet.  ROHCoWEM protocol will be

Internet Draft       ROHC over Wireless Ethernet    11 September 2002 
                           Media (ROHCoWEM) 
 
   In order to support ROHC over Wireless Ethernet Media, ROHCoWEM has 
   been designed under the following constraints.  
    
   1) The ROHCoWEM protocol must be able to request and negotiate 
   configuration parameters for the compression. 
    
   2) The ROHCoWEM protocol must be able to support the transport of 
   ROHC data packets as defined in RFC3095 [2] section 5.2. 
    
   To satisfy these requirements, the ROHCoWEM protocol defines a 
   ROHCoWEM type field.  The ROHCoWEM type field is used to define 
   various packet formats required to support ROHCoWEM.  Figure 1, 
   illustrates the ROHCoWEM header format to be used for ROHCoWEM.  The 
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

                           Media (ROHCoWEM) 
 
   ROHC assumes that the link layer delivers packets in sequence.  
   Ethernet normally does not reorder packets.  When using priority 
   reordering mechanisms such as 802.1P [4] and ROHCoWEM, care must be 
   taken so that packets that share the same compression context are not 
   reordered.  (Note that in certain cases, reordering may be acceptable 
   to ROHC, such as within a sequence of packets that all do not change 
   the decompression context).  
    
3.1 ROHCoWEM Type: ROHCoWEM Configuration Request and Response 
    
   In order to establish compression of IP datagrams sent over a channel 
   (for example, a Wireless Ethernet link) each end of the channel must 
   agree on a set of configuration parameters for the compression.  The 
   process of negotiating channel parameters for network layer protocols 
   is handled by using ROHCoWEM configuration request and response 
   packets. 
    
3.1.1 ROHCoWEM Configuration Request 
 
   Description 
    
   This ROHCoWEM configuration request packet is used to request 
   parameters needed for Robust Header Compression.  A node MUST send 
   this request packet to another node to get a ROHCoWEM configuration 
   response packet.  A node should send this request packet when a data 
   flow, such as VoIP, is detected.  This request packet would be the 
   first step in establishing a ROHC session with another node.  A node 
   MUST stop sending ROHCoWEM configuration request packets when it has 
   successfully received a ROHCoWEM configuration response packets for 
   one of it's request.  A node MUST limit the rate at which the node 
   sends ROHCoWEM configuration request packets to the same node.  A 
   node may send three initial requests at a maximum rate of one request 
   per second.  After that, the rate at which request message are sent 
   by a node MUST be reduced so as to limit the overhead on the local 
   link.  Subsequent request messages MUST be sent using a binary 
   exponential backoff mechanism, doubling the interval between 
   consecutive requests, up to a maximum interval.  The maximum interval 
   SHOULD be chosen appropriately based upon the characteristics of the 
   media over which the node is requesting.  This maximum interval 
   SHOULD be at least one minute between requests.  Not all peer devices 
   will have ROHCoWEM functionality; therefore nodes SHOULD stop sending 
   configuration request in case a response is not received after a few 
   attempts.  The format is summarized in Figure 2. Note the ROHCoWEM 
   configuration request packet only contains the ROHCoWEM type field. 
   The field is transmitted from left to right.

   ROHCoWEM configuration response packets are used to respond to 
   ROHCoWEM configuration requests. The response contains the ROHC 
   parameters that are supported. Each node which supports ROHCoWEM MUST

         8 + length of the suboptions 
    
            The value of the length field indicates the length, in 
         octets, of the ROHCoWEM Configuration Response Packet in its 
         entirety, including the lengths of the type, extension flag, 
         and length field.  The length of the ROHCoWEM Configuration 
         Response Packet is always 8 octets for the required fields plus 
         the length of the suboptions which is at least 2 octets and 
         therefore the value of the Length is always >= 10 octets. 
    
         The length may be increased if the presence of additional 
         parameters is indicated by additional suboptions. 
    
      MAX_CID 
         The MAX_CID field is two octets and indicates the maximum value 
         of a context identifier. 
    
         Suggested value: 15 
    
         MAX_CID must be at least 0 and at most 16383 (The value 0 
         implies having one context). 
    
      MRRU 
         The MRRU field is two octets and indicates the maximum 
         reconstructed reception unit (see RFC3095 [2], section 5.1.1). 
    
            Suggested value: 0 
    
      MAX_HEADER 
         The largest header size in octets that may be compressed. 
    
            Suggested value: 168 octets 
    
         The value of MAX_HEADER should be large enough so that at least 
         the outer network layer header can be compressed.  To increase 
         compression efficiency MAX_HEADER should be set to a value 
         large enough to cover common combinations of network and 
         transport layer headers. 
    
            NOTE: The four ROHC profiles defined in RFC 3095 do not 
         provide for a MAX_HEADER parameter.  The parameter MAX_HEADER 
         defined by this document is therefore without consequence in 
         these profiles. 
            Other profiles (e.g., ones based on RFC 2507) can make use 
         of the parameter by explicitly referencing it.

         The suboptions field consists of zero or more suboptions.  Each

         field, and the payload. 
    
    
3.3.1 ROHC Payload Padding Count Extension 
    
   Description 
    
   ROHC payload padding count extension is used to indicate the number 
   of padding bytes that were added to the packet.  Padding bytes may be 
   added to the packet to satisfy link layer requirement.  For example, 
   Ethernet requires that each packet is at least 64 bytes long.  If 
   ROHCWoE is sent over Ethernet, then one or more padding bytes will be 
   added to make the packet at least 64 bytes long.  This extension is 
   intended to be used in typical WLAN/WPAN deployment in which the 
   WLAN/WPAN access points are interconnected by one or more Ethernet 
   segments. In this scenario, a router, gateway, or another host on the 
   Ethernet segment may be performing the ROHCoWEM compressor / 
   decompressor operations.  Then theses packets would be sent / 
   received over Ethernet to and from the WLAN/WPAN access points.  The 
   WLAN/WPAN access point would find the ROHC payload padding count 
   extension and be able to remove the unnecessary padding bytes before 
   the packet is sent over the Wireless Ethernet Media.  This operation 
   could be done without adding significant processing requirement to 
   the access points.  The format is summarized in Figure 8. The fields 
   are transmitted from left to right.

         The number of padding bytes that have been added to the

4. Security Considerations 
    
   Due to the shared media feature of Ethernet, ROHCoWEM packets may be 
   sent by spoofing hosts and may not be from the originator specified 
   in the Ethernet packet.  
    
   The security considerations of ROHC [RFC3095] apply. 
    
      The use of header compression can, in rare cases, cause the 
   delivery abuse of packets.  If necessary, confidentiality of packet 
   contents should be assured by encryption. 
    
   Encryption applied at the IP layer (e.g., using IPSEC mechanisms) 
   precludes header compression of the encrypted headers, though 
   compression of the outer IP header and authentication/security 
   headers is still possible as described in [RFC3095].  For RTP 
   packets, full header compression is possible if the RTP payload is 
   encrypted by itself without encrypting the UDP or RTP headers, as 
   described in [RFC1889].  This method is appropriate when the UDP and 
   RTP header information need not be kept confidential. 
    
5. IANA Considerations 
    
   The ROHCoWEM protocol will require a new Ethernet protocol type.  
   This Ethernet type shall be reserved for ROHCoWEM.  In additional the 
   ROHCoWEM protocol defines a ROHCoWEM type field.  The ROHCoWEM 
   protocol reserves the range of 0x00 to 0x7F and currently defines 
   0x00 to 0x03 for valid ROHCoWEM types.  ROHCoWEM also reserves the 
   ROHCoWEM type of 0x7F to be use for future extensions.
