Abstract

   This document forms a certificate profile for Qualified Certificates,
   based on RFC 2459, for use in the Internet. The term Qualified
   Certificate is used to describe a certificate with a certain
   qualified status within applicable governing law. Further, Qualified
   Certificates are issued exclusively to physical persons.

   The goal of this document is to define a general syntax independent
   of local legal requirements. The profile is however designed to allow
   further profiling in order to meet specific local needs.

   It is important to note that the profile does not define any legal
   requirements for Qualified Certificates.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


1  Introduction

   This specification is one part of a family of standards for the X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. It is based on RFC
   2459, which defines underlying certificate formats and semantics
   needed for a full implementation of this standard.

   The standard profiles the format for a specific type of certificates
   named Qualified Certificates. The term Qualified Certificates and the
   assumptions that affects the scope of this document are discussed in
   Section 2.

   Section 3 defines requirements on information content in Qualified
   Certificates.  This profile addresses two fields in the basic
   certificate as well as five certificate extensions.  The certificate
   fields are the subject and issuer fields.  The certificate extensions
   are subject directory attributes, certificate policies, key usage, a
   private extension for storage of biometric data and a private
   extension for storage of statements related to Qualified
   Certificates.

   In Section 4, some security considerations are discussed in order to
   clarify the security context in which Qualified Certificates are
   assumed to be utilized. Section 5 contains the references.

   Appendix A contains all relevant ASN.1 [X.680] structures that are
   not already defined in RFC 2459. Appendix B contains a note on
   attributes. Appendix C contains an example certificate.  Appendix D
   contains authors' addresses and Appendix E contains the IETF
   Copyright Statement.

   It should be noted that this specification does not define the
   specific semantics of Qualified Certificates, and does not define the
   policies that should be used with them. That is, this document
   defines what information should go into Qualified Certificates, but
   not what that information means.  A system that uses Qualified
   Certificates must define its own semantics for the information in
   Qualified Certificates. It is expected that laws and corporate
   policies will make these definitions.

2  Requirements and Assumptions

   The term "Qualified Certificate" has been used by the European
   Commission to describe a certain type of certificates with specific
   relevance for European legislation.  This specification is intended
   to support this class of certificates, but its scope is not limited
   to this application.

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


   Within this standard the term "Qualified Certificate" is used more
   generally, describing the format for a certificate whose primary
   purpose is identifying a person with high level of assurance in
   public non-repudiation services. The actual mechanisms that will
   decide whether a certificate should or should not be considered to be
   a "Qualified Certificate" in regard to any legislation are outside
   the scope of this standard.

   Harmonization in the field of Qualified Certificates is essential
   within several aspects that fall outside the scope of RFC 2459. The
   most important aspects that affect the scope of this specification
   are:

    - Definition of names and identity information in order to identify
      the associated subject in a uniform way.

    - Definition of information which identifies the CA and the
      jurisdiction under which the CA operates when issuing a
      particular certificate.

    - Definition of key usage extension usage for Qualified
      Certificates.

    - Definition of information structure for storage of biometric
      information.

    - Definition of a standardized way to store predefined statements
      with relevance for Qualified Certificates.

    - Requirements for critical extensions.

 2.1  Properties

   A Qualified Certificate as defined in this standard is assumed to
   have the following properties:

   - The certificate is issued by a CA that makes a public statement
     that the certificate serves the purpose of a Qualified
     Certificate, as discussed in Section 2.2

   - The certificate indicates a certificate policy consistent with
     liabilities, practices and procedures undertaken by the CA, as
     discussed in 2.3

   - The certificate is issued to a natural person (living human being).

   - The certificate contains an identity based on a pseudonym or a
     real name of the subject.

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


 2.2  Statement of Purpose

   For a certificate to serve the purpose of being a Qualified
   Certificate, this profile assumes that the CA will have to include in
   the certificate a public statement that explicitly defines this
   intent.

   The function of this statement is thus to assist any concerned entity
   in evaluating the risk associated with creating or accepting
   signatures that are based on a Qualified Certificate.

 2.3  Policy Issues

   Certain policy aspects define the context in which this profile is to
   be understood and used. It is however outside the scope of this
   profile to specify any policies or legal aspects that will govern
   services that issue or utilize certificates according to this
   profile.

   It is however assumed that the issuing CA will undertake to follow a
   publicly available certificate policy that is consistent with its
   liabilities, practices and procedures.

 2.4  Uniqueness of names

   Distinguished name is originally defined in X.501 [X.501] as a
   representation of a directory name, defined as a construct that
   identifies a particular object from among the set of all objects. An
   object can be assigned a distinguished name without being represented
   by an entry in the Directory, but this name is then the name its
   object entry could have had if it were represented in the Directory.
   In the context of qualified certificates, a distinguished name
   denotes a set of attribute values [X.501] which forms a name that is
   unambiguous within a certain domain that forms either a real or a
   virtual DIT (Directory Information Tree)[X.501].  In the case of
   subject names the domain is assumed to be at least the issuing domain
   of the CA. The distinguished name MUST be unique for each subject
   entity certified by the one CA as defined by the issuer name field,
   during the whole life time of the CA.

3  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile

   This section defines a profile for Qualified Certificates. The
   profile is based on the Internet certificate profile RFC 2459 which
   in turn is based on the X.509 version 3 format. For full
   implementation of this section implementers are REQUIRED to consult
   the underlying formats and semantics defined in RFC 2459.

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


   ASN.1 definitions relevant for this section that are not supplied by
   RFC 2459 are supplied in Appendix A.

 3.1  Basic Certificate Fields

   This specification provides additional details regarding the contents
   of two fields in the basic certificate.  These fields are the issuer
   and subject fields.

  3.1.1  Issuer

   The issuer field SHALL identify the organization responsible for
   issuing the certificate, and SHALL include a registered name of the
   organization.

   The identity of the issuer SHALL be specified using an appropriate
   subset of the following attributes:

         domainComponent;
         countryName;
         stateOrProvinceName;
         organizationName;
         localityName; and
         serialNumber.

   Additional attributes MAY be present but they SHOULD NOT be necessary
   to identify the issuing organization.

   The legal jurisdiction for the issuing CA SHOULD be consistent with
   the issuer name.

   It should be noted, however, that a relying party MAY have to consult
   associated certificate policies and/or the issuer's CPS, in order to
   determine the semantics of name fields and legal jurisdiction.

  3.1.2  Subject

   The subject field of a certificate compliant with this profile SHALL
   contain a distinguished name of the subject (see 2.4 for definition
   of distinguished name).

   The subject field SHALL contain an appropriate subset of the
   following attributes:

      countryName;
      commonName;
      surname;
      givenName;



Santesson, et. al.       Expires: January 2001                  [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


      pseudonym;
      serialNumber;
      organizationName;
      organizationalUnitName;
      stateOrProvinceName
      localityName and
      postalAddress.

   Other attributes may be present but MUST NOT be necessary to
   distinguish the subject name from other subject names within the
   issuer domain.

   Of these attributes, the subject field SHALL include at least one of
   the following:

      Choice   I:  commonName
      Choice  II:  givenName
      Choice III:  pseudonym

   The countryName attribute value specifies a general context in which
   other attributes are to be understood. The country attribute does not
   necessarily indicate the subject's country of citizenship or country
   of residence, nor does it have to indicate the country of issuance.

   Note: Many X.500 implementations require the presence of countryName
   in the DIT.  In cases where the subject name, as specified in the
   subject field, specifies a public X.500 directory entry, the
   countryName attribute SHOULD always be present.

   The commonName attribute value SHALL, when present, contain a name of
   the subject. This MAY be in the subject's preferred presentation
   format, or a format preferred by the CA, or some other format.
   Pseudonyms, nicknames and names with spelling other than defined by
   the registered name MAY be used. To understand the nature of the name
   presented in commonName, complying applications MAY have to examine
   present values of the givenName and surname attributes, or the
   pseudonym attribute.

   Note: Many client implementations presuppose the presence of the
   commonName attribute value in the subject field and use this value to
   display the subject's name regardless of present givenName, surname
   or pseudonym attribute values.

   The surname and givenName attribute types SHALL, if present, contain
   the registered name of the subject, depending on the laws under which
   the CA prepares the certificate. These attributes SHALL be used in
   the subject field if the commonName attribute is not present. In
   cases where the subject only has a single name registered, the

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


   givenName attribute SHALL be used and the surname attribute SHALL be
   omitted.

   The pseudonym attribute type SHALL, if present, contain a pseudonym
   of the subject. Use of the pseudonym attribute MUST NOT be combined
   with use of any of the attributes surname and/or givenName.

   The serialNumber attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to
   differentiate between names where the subject field would otherwise
   be identical.  This attribute has no defined semantics beyond
   ensuring uniqueness of subject names.  It MAY contain a number or
   code assigned by the CA or an identifier assigned by a government or
   civil authority.  It is the CA's responsibility to ensure that the
   serialNumber is sufficient to resolve any subject name collisions.

   The organizationName and the organizationalUnitName attribute types
   SHALL, when present, be used to store the name and relevant
   information of an organization with which the subject is associated.
   The type of association between the organization and the subject is
   beyond the scope of this document.

   The postalAddress, the stateOrProvinceName and the localityName
   attribute types SHALL, when present, be used to store address and
   geographical information with which the subject is associated. If an
   organizationName value also is present then the postalAddress,
   stateOrProvinceName and localityName attribute values SHALL be
   associated with the specified organization. The type of association
   between the postalAddress, stateOrProvinceName and the localityName
   and either the subject or the organizationName is beyond the scope of
   this document.

   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the attributes
   named in this section.

 3.2  Certificate Extensions

   This specification provides additional details regarding the contents
   of five certificate extensions.  These extensions are the subject
   directory attributes, certificate policies, key usage, private
   extension for biometric information and private extension for
   Qualified Certificate statements.

  3.2.1  Subject Directory Attributes

   The subjectDirectoryAttributes extension MAY contain additional
   attributes, associated with the subject, as complement to present
   information in the subject field and the subject alternative name
   extension.



Santesson, et. al.       Expires: January 2001                  [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


   Attributes suitable for storage in this extension are attributes,
   which are not part of the subject's distinguished name, but which MAY
   still be useful for other purposes (e.g. authorization).

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the following
   attributes:

      title;
      dateOfBirth;
      placeOfBirth;
      gender;
      countryOfCitizenship; and
      countryOfResidence.

   Other attributes MAY be included according to local definitions.

   The title attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to store a
   designated position or function of the subject within the
   organization specified by present organizational attributes in the
   subject field. The association between the title, the subject and the
   organization is beyond the scope of this document.

   The dateOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
   the date of birth of the subject. The manner in which the date of
   birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The placeOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
   the place of birth of the subject. The manner in which the place of
   birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The gender attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of the
   gender of the subject. For females the value "F" and for males the
   value "M" have to be used. The manner in which the gender is
   associated with the subject is outside the scope of this document.

   The countryOfCitizenship attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
   identifier of at least one of the subject's claimed country of
   citizenship at the time that the certificate was issued. If the
   subject is a citizen of more than one country, more than one country
   MAY be present. Determination of citizenship is a matter of law and
   is outside the scope of this document.

   The countryOfResidence attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
   value of at least one country in which the subject is resident. If

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


   the subject is a resident of more than one country, more than one
   country MAY be present.  Determination of residence is a matter of
   law and is outside the scope of this document.

  3.2.2 Certificate Policies

   The certificate policies extension SHALL contain the identifier of at
   least one certificate policy which reflects the practices and
   procedures undertaken by the CA. The certificate policy extension MAY
   be marked critical.

   A statement by the issuer stating the purpose of the certificate as
   discussed in Section 2.2 SHOULD be evident through indicated
   policies.

   In order to enhance path validation based on policy object
   identifiers any statement related to Qualified Certificates, as
   defined in 3.2.5, SHOULD also be defined by included certificate
   policies.

   Certificate policies MAY be combined with any qualifier defined in
   RFC 2459.

  3.2.3  Key Usage

   The key usage extension SHALL be present. If the key usage
   nonRepudiation bit is asserted then it SHOULD NOT be combined with
   any other key usage , i.e. if set, the key usage non-repudiation
   SHOULD be set exclusively.

   The key usage extension MAY be marked critical.

  3.2.4  Biometric Information

   This section defines an extension for storage of biometric
   information. Biometric information is stored in the form of a hash of
   a biometric template.

   The purpose of this extension is to provide means for authentication
   of biometric information. The biometric information that corresponds
   to the stored hash is not stored in this extension, but the extension
   MAY include an URI pointing to a location where this information can
   be obtained. If included, this URI does not imply that this is the
   only way to access this information.

   It is RECOMMENDED that biometric information in this extension are
   limited to information types suitable for human verification, i.e.,
   where the decision of whether the information is an accurate



Santesson, et. al.       Expires: January 2001                 [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


   representation of the subject is naturally performed by a person.
   This implies a usage where the biometric information is represented
   by, for example, a graphical image displayed to the relying party,
   which MAY be used by the relying party to enhance identification of
   the subject.

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

      biometricInfo  EXTENSION ::= {
          SYNTAX             BiometricSyntax
          IDENTIFIED BY      id-pe-biometricInfo }

      id-pe-biometricInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= {id-pe 2}

      BiometricSyntax ::= SEQUENCE OF BiometricData

      BiometricData ::= SEQUENCE {

          biometricDataHash    OCTET STRING,
          sourceDataUri        IA5String OPTIONAL }

      TypeOfBiometricData ::= CHOICE {
          predefinedBiometricType    PredefinedBiometricType,
          biometricDataID            OBJECT IDENTIFIER }

      PredefinedBiometricType ::= INTEGER { picture(0),
          handwritten-signature(1)} (picture|handwritten-signature,...)

   The predefined biometric type picture, when present, SHALL identify
   that the source picture is in the form of a displayable graphical
   image of the subject. The hash of the graphical image SHALL only be
   calculated over the image data excluding any labels defining the
   image type.

   The predefined biometric type handwritten-signature, when present,
   SHALL identify that the source data is in the form of a displayable
   graphical image of the subject's handwritten signature. The hash of
   the graphical image SHALL only be calculated over the image data
   excluding any labels defining the image type.

  3.2.5  Qualified Certificate Statements

   This section defines an extension for inclusion of defined statements
   related to Qualified Certificates.

   A typical statement suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be a
   statement by the issuer that the certificate is issued as a Qualified



Santesson, et. al.       Expires: January 2001                 [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2000


   Certificate in accordance with a particular legal system (as
   discussed in Section 2.2).

   Other statements suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be
   statements related to the applicable legal jurisdiction within which
   the certificate is issued. As an example this MAY include a maximum
   reliance limit for the certificate indicating restrictions on CA's
   liability.

   Each statement SHALL include an object identifier for the statement
   and MAY also include optional qualifying data contained in the
   statementInfo parameter.

   If the statementInfo parameter is included then the object identifier
   of the statement SHALL define the syntax and SHOULD define the
   semantics of this parameter.  If the object identifier does not
   define the semantics, a relying party may have to consult a relevant
   certificate policy or CPS to determine the exact semantics.

   This extension may be critical or non-critical.

      qcStatements  EXTENSION ::= {
          SYNTAX             QCStatements
          IDENTIFIED BY      id-pe-qcStatements }

      id-pe-qcStatements     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 3 }

      QCStatements ::= SEQUENCE OF QCStatement

      QCStatement ::= SEQUENCE {

      SupportedStatements QC-STATEMENT ::= { qcStatement-1,...}

   3.2.5.1 Predefined Statements

   This profile includes one predefined object identifier (id-qcs-
   pkixQCSyntax-v1), identifying conformance with syntax and semantics
   defined in this profile. This Qualified Certificate profile is
   referred to as version 1.

      qcStatement-1 QC-STATEMENT ::= { SemanticsInformation IDENTIFIED

   one or more name registration authorities.

   The semanticsIdentifier component, if present, SHALL contain an OID,
   defining semantics for attributes and names in basic certificate
   fields and certificate extensions. The OID may define semantics for
   all, or for a subgroup of all present attributes and/or names.

   The NameRegistrationAuthorities component, if present, SHALL contain
   a name of one or more name registration authorities, responsible for
   registration of attributes or names associated with the subject. The
   association between an identified name registration authority and
   present attributes MAY be defined by a semantics identifier OID, by a
   certificate policy (or CPS) or some other implicit factors.

   If a value of type SemanticsInformation is present in a QCStatement
   then at least one of the fields semanticsIdentifier and
   nameRegistrationAuthorities must be present, as indicated.

4  Security Considerations

   The legal value of a digital signature that is validated with a
   Qualified Certificate will be highly dependent upon the policy
   governing the use of the associated private key. Both the private key
   holder as well as the relying party should make sure that the private
   key is used only with the consent of the legitimate key holder.

   Since the public keys are for public use with legal implications for
   involved parties, certain conditions should exist before CAs issues
   certificates as Qualified Certificates. The associated private keys
   must be unique for the subject, and must be maintained under the
   subject's sole control.  That is, a CA should not issue a qualified
   certificate if the private key is shared among entities, or the means
   to use the private key is not protected against unintended usage.
   This implies that the CA must perform proof-of-possession of the

   private key. In addition, it implies that the CA have some knowledge
   about the subject's cryptographic module.

   CAs should not issue CA certificates with policy mapping extensions
   indicating acceptance of another CA's policy unless these conditions
   are met.

   Combining the nonRepudiation bit in the keyUsage certificate
   extension with other keyUsage bits may have security implications and
   this specification therefore recommends against such practices.

   Comparing two qualified certificates to determine if they represent
   the same physical entity may provide misleading results and should be
   performed with care.

   This specification is a profile of RFC 2459.  The security
   considerations section of that document applies to this specification
   as well.

APPENDICES

A. ASN.1 definitions

   As in RFC 2459, ASN.1 modules are supplied in two different variants
   of the ASN.1 syntax.

   Appendix A.1 is in the 1988 syntax, and does not use macros. However,
   since the module imports type definitions from modules in RFC 2459
   which are not completely in the 1988 syntax, the same comments as in
   RFC 2459 regarding its use applies here as well; i.e. Appendix A.1
   may be parsed by an 1988 ASN.1-parser by removing the definitions for
   the UNIVERSAL types and all references to them in RFC 2459's 1988
   modules.

   Appendix A.2 is in the 1993 syntax. However, since the module imports
   type definitions from modules in RFC 2459 which are not completely in
   the 1993 syntax, the same comments as in RFC 2459 regarding its use
   applies here as well; i.e. Appendix A.2 may be parsed by an 1993
   ASN.1-parser by removing the UTF8String choice from the definition of
   DirectoryString in the module PKIX1Explicit93 in RFC 2459. Appendix
   A.2 may be parsed "as is" by an 1997 ASN.1 parser, however.

B. A Note on Attributes

   This document defines several new attributes, both for use in the
   subject field of issued certificates and in the
   subjectDirectoryAttributes extension. In the interest of conformity,
   they have been defined here using the ASN.1 ATTRIBUTE definition from
   RFC 2459, which is sufficient for the purposes of this document, but
   greatly simplified in comparison with ISO/ITU's definition. A
   complete definition of these new attributes (including matching
   rules), along with object classes to support them in LDAP-accessible
   directories, can be found in [PKCS 9].

C. Example Certificate

   This section contains the ASN.1 structure, an ASN.1 dump, and the
   DER-encoding of a certificate issued in conformance with this
   profile. The example has been developed with the help of the OSS
   ASN.1 compiler. The certificate has the following characteristics:

      1.  The certificate is signed with RSA and the SHA-1 hash algo-
          rithm
      2.  The issuer's distinguished name is O=GMD - Forschungszentrum
          Informationstechnik GmbH; C=DE
      3.  The subject's distinguished name is CN=Petra M. Barzin,
          O=GMD - Forschungszentrum Informationstechnik GmbH, C=DE
      5.  The certificate was issued on May 1, 2000 and will expire on
          November 1, 2000
      6.  The certificate contains a 1024 bit RSA key
      7.  The certificate includes a critical key usage extension
          exclusively indicating non-repudiation
      8.  The certificate includes a certificate policy identifier
          extension indicating the practices and procedures undertaken
          by the issuing CA (object identifier 1.3.36.8.1.1). The
          certificate policy object identifier is defined by TeleTrust,
          Germany. It is required to be set in a certificate conformant
          to the German digital signature law.
      9.  The certificate includes a subject directory attributes
          extension containing the following attributes:

          surname:               Barzin
          given name:            Petra
          date of birth:         October, 14th 1971

 C.1 ASN.1 Structure

   C.1.1 Extensions

   Since extensions are DER-encoded already when placed in the structure
   to be signed, they are for clarity shown here in the value notation
   defined in [X.680].

   C.1.1.1 The subjectDirectoryAttributes extension

   petrasSubjDirAttrs AttributesSyntax ::= {
       {
           type id-pda-countryOfCitizenship,
           values {
               PrintableString : "DE"
           }
       },
       {
           type id-pda-gender,
           values {
               PrintableString : "F"
           }
       },
       {
           type id-pda-dateOfBirth,
           values {
               GeneralizedTime : "197110140000Z"
           }
       },
       {
           type id-pda-placeOfBirth,
           values {
               UTF8String : "Darmstadt"
           }
       }
   }

   C.1.1.2 The keyUsage extension

   petrasKeyUsage KeyUsage ::= {nonRepudiation}

   C.1.1.3 The certificatePolicies extension

   petrasCertificatePolicies CertificatePoliciesSyntax ::= {

       {
           policyIdentifier {1 3 36 8 1 1}
       }
   }

   C.1.1.4 The qcStatements extension

   petrasQCStatement QCStatements ::= {
       {
           statementId   id-qcs-pkixQCSyntax-v1,
           statementInfo SemanticsInformation : {

               }
          }
       }
   }

   C.1.1.5 The authorityKeyIdentifier extension

   petrasAKI AuthorityKeyIdentifier ::= {
       keyIdentifier '000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0FFEDCBA98'H
   }

   C.1.2 The certificate

   The signed portion of the certificate is shown here in the value
   notation defined in [X.680]. Note that extension values are already
   DER encoded in this structure. Some values has been truncated for
   readability purposes.
