                  PCE support for Maximizing Diversity
                     draft-dhody-pce-of-diverse-07

Abstract

   The computation of one or a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched
   Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks is subject to a set of one or more
   specific optimization criteria, referred to as objective functions.

   In the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture, a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may want a set of services that are required
   to be diverse (disjointed) from each other.  In case when full
   diversity could not be achieved, it is helpful to maximize diversity
   as much as possible (or in other words, minimize the common shared
   resources).

   This document defines objective function code types for three new
   objective functions for this purpose to be applied to a set of
   synchronized path computation requests.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the specifications for the Path Computation
   Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP specifies the
   communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path

   Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on the PCE
   architecture [RFC4655].

   Further [RFC5440] describes dependent path computation requests in
   which case computations cannot be performed independently of each
   other, and usually used for diverse path computation.  [RFC5440] and
   [RFC6006] describe the use of Synchronization VECtor (SVEC)
   dependency flags (i.e., Node, Link, or Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)
   diverse flags).

   In some scenario it may be noted that full diversity cannot be
   achieved because of topology considerations, deployment
   considerations, transient network issues etc.  In this case it would
   be helpful to maximize diversity as much as possible (or in other
   words minimize the common shared resources (Node, Link or SRLG)
   between a set of paths during path computation).

   It is interesting to note that for non synchronized diverse path
   computation the X bit in Exclude Route Object (XRO) or Explicit
   Exclusion Route subobject (EXRS) [RFC5521] can be used, where X bit
   set as 1 indicates that the resource specified SHOULD be excluded
   from the path computed by the PCE, but MAY be included subject to PCE
   policy and the absence of a viable path that meets the other
   constraints and excludes the resource.  Thus X bit can be used in a
   way to maximize diversity (or minimize common shared resources) when
   full diversity cannot be achieved.

   This document defines objective function code types for three new
   objective functions for this purpose to be applied to a set of
   synchronized path computation requests.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The terminology is as per [RFC5440].

3.  Extension to PCEP

   [RFC5541] describes and define Objective function (OF) used in PCEP
   protocol.

Internet-Draft                 OF-DIVERSE                       May 2017


   To minimize the common shared resources (Node, Link or SRLG) between
   a set of paths during path computation three new OF codes are
   proposed:

   MSL

   *  Name:  Minimize the number of shared (common) Links.

   *  Objective Function Code:  TBD1

   *  Description:  Find a set of paths such that it passes through the
      least number of shared (common) links.

   MSN

   *  Name:  Minimize the number of shared (common) Nodes.

   *  Objective Function Code:  TBD2

   *  Description:  Find a set of paths such that it passes through the
      least number of shared (common) nodes.

   MSS

   *  Name:  Minimize the number of shared (common) SRLG.

   *  Objective Function Code:  TBD3

   *  Description:  Find a set of paths such that it share least number
      of common SRLGs.

4.  Other Considerations

4.1.  Relationship between SVEC Diversity Flags and OF

   [RFC5440] uses SVEC diversity flag for node, link or SRLG to describe
   the potential disjointness between the set of path computation
   requests used in PCEP protocol.  [I-D.dwpz-pce-domain-diverse]
   further extends by adding domain-diverse O-bit in SVEC object and a
   new OF Code for minimizing the number of shared transit domain.

   This document defines three new OF codes to maximize diversity as
   much as possible, in other words, minimize the common shared
   resources (Node,Link or SRLG) between a set of paths.

   It may be interesting to note that the diversity flags in the SVEC
   object and OF for diversity can be used together.  Some example of
   usage are listed below -

Internet-Draft                 OF-DIVERSE                       May 2017


   o  SVEC object with node-diverse bit=1 - ensure full node-diversity.

   o  SVEC object with node-diverse bit=1 and OF=MSS - full node diverse
      with as much as SRLG-diversity as possible.

   o  SVEC object with domain-diverse bit=1;link diverse bit=1 and
      OF=MSS - full domain and node diverse path with as much as SRLG-
      diversity as possible.

   o  SVEC object with node-diverse bit=1 and OF=MSN - ensure full node-
      diversity.

4.2.  Inter-Domain Considerations

   The mechanics for synchronous end to end path computations using
   Backward-Recursive PCE-Based Computation (BRPC) procedure [RFC5441]
   described in [RFC6006].

   In H-PCE [RFC6805] architecture, the parent PCE is used to compute a
   multi-domain path based on the domain connectivity information.  The
   parent PCE may be requested to provide a end to end path or only the
   sequence of domains.  Child PCE should be able to request
   synchronized diverse end to end paths from its parent PCE.

   The new objective function described in this document can be used to
   maximize diversity when full diverse paths cannot be found.

4.3.  Domain Diversity

   As per [I-D.dwpz-pce-domain-diverse].

4.4.  Diversity v/s Optimality

   In case of non-synchronized path computation, PCE may be requested to
   provide an optimal primary path first and then PCC requests for a
   backup path with exclusion.  Note that this approach does not
   guarantee diversity comparing to disjoint path computations for
   primary and backup path in a synchronized manner.

   A synchronized path computation with diversity flags and/or objective
   function is used to make sure that both the primary path and the
   backup path can be computed simultaneously with full diversity or
   optimized to be as diverse as possible.  In the latter case we may
   sacrifice optimal path for diversity, thus there is a trade-off
   between the two.

   An implementation may further choose to analyze the trade-off i.e. it
   may send multiple request to PCE asking to optimize based on

   diversity as well as say, cost and make an intelligent choice between
   them.

5.  Security Considerations

   PCEP security mechanisms are described in [RFC5440] and are used to
   secure entire PCEP messages.  Nothing in this document changes the
   message flows or introduces any new messages, so the security
   mechanisms set out in [RFC5440] continue to be applicable.

   This document add new OF codes that may optionally be carried on PCEP
   messages with OF object [RFC5541] and will be automatically secured
   using the mechanisms described in [RFC5440].

   If a PCEP message is vulnerable to attack (for example, because the
   security mechanisms are not used), then the OF object could be used
   as part of an attack; however, it is likely that other objects will
   provide far more significant ways of attacking a PCE or PCC in this
   case.

6.  Manageability Considerations

6.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to [RFC5440], the PCC should construct the SVECs to
   identify and associate diverse SVEC relationships.  Considerations
   for use of objective functions are mentioned in [RFC5541].

6.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP MIB Module defined in [RFC7420], there are no additional
   parameters identified in this document.

6.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   [RFC5440] provides a sufficient description for this document.  There
   are no additional considerations.

6.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   [RFC5440] provides a sufficient description for this document.  There
   are no additional considerations.

6.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   [RFC5440] provides a sufficient description for this document.  There
   are no additional considerations.

6.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440] and
   [RFC5541].

7.  IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 3, three new Objective Functions have been
   defined.  IANA has made the following allocations from the PCEP
   "Objective Function" sub-registry:

   Value      Description                        Reference
   (TBD1)     MSL                                [This I.D.]
   (TBD2)     MSN                                [This I.D.]
   (TBD3)     MSS                                [This I.D.]

Appendix B.  Example

   This section illustrate an example based on SRLG.

   Node A is Ingress, Node D is Egress.  A synchronized path computation
   requests for SRLG disjoint path may be issued using the SVEC object
   as described in [RFC5440].  In above topology a full SRLG disjoint
   paths are not possible because of some topology considerations.

   In such scenario, an OF MSS maybe used instead to minimize the number
   of shared (common) SRLG to get maximum diversity when full diversity
   may not be possible.

   In case of sequential non-synchronized path computation, primary path
   will be computed first, say the path is (A--B--C--D) with SRLG list
   (1,2,3).  A backup path computation using XRO and SRLG sub-object
   with X bit (loose) set as 1, can be used to achieve a similar result.
