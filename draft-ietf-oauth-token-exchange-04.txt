          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange: An STS for the REST of Us
                   draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange-04

Abstract

   This specification defines a protocol for a lightweight HTTP- and
   JSON- based Security Token Service (STS) by defining how to request
   and obtain security tokens from OAuth 2.0 authorization servers,
   including security tokens employing impersonation and delegation.

1.  Introduction

   A security token is a set of information that facilitates the sharing
   of identity and security information in heterogeneous environments or
   across security domains.  Examples of security tokens include JSON
   Web Tokens (JWTs) [JWT] and SAML Assertions [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os].
   Security tokens are typically signed to achieve integrity and
   sometimes also encrypted to achieve confidentiality.  Security tokens
   are also sometimes described as Assertions, such as in [RFC7521].

   A Security Token Service (STS) is a service capable of validating and
   issuing security tokens, which enables clients to obtain appropriate
   access credentials for resources in heterogeneous environments or
   across security domains.  Web Service clients have used WS-Trust
   [WS-Trust] as the protocol to interact with an STS for token
   exchange, however WS-Trust is a fairly heavyweight protocol, which
   uses XML, SOAP, etc.  Whereas, the trend in modern Web development
   has been towards lightweight services utilizing RESTful patterns and
   JSON.  The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749] and OAuth 2.0
   Bearer Tokens [RFC6750] have emerged as popular standards for
   authorizing and securing access to HTTP and RESTful resources but do
   not provide everything necessary to facilitate token exchange
   interactions.

   This specification defines a lightweight protocol extending OAuth 2.0
   that enables clients to request and obtain security tokens from
   authorization servers acting in the role of an STS.  Similar to OAuth
   2.0, this specification focuses on client developer simplicity and
   requires only an HTTP client and JSON parser, which are nearly
   universally available in modern development environments.  The STS
   protocol defined in this specification is not itself RESTful (an STS
   doesn't lend itself particularly well to a REST approach) but does
   utilize communication patterns and data formats that should be
   familiar to developers accustomed to working with RESTful systems.

   A new grant type for a token exchange request and the associated
   specific parameters for such a request to the token endpoint are
   defined by this specification.  A token exchange response is a normal
   OAuth 2.0 response from the token endpoint with a few additional
   parameters defined herein to provide information to the client.

   The entity that makes the request to exchange tokens is considered
   the client in the context of the token exchange interaction.
   However, that does not restrict usage of this profile to traditional

   OAuth clients.  An OAuth resource server, for example, might assume
   the role of the client during token exchange in order to trade an
   access token, which it received in a protected resource request, for
   a new token that is appropriate to include in a call to a backend
   service.  The new token might be an access token that is more
   narrowly scoped for the downstream service or it could be an entirely
   different kind of token.

   The scope of this specification is limited to the definition of a
   basic request and response protocol for an STS-style token exchange
   utilizing OAuth 2.0.  Although a few new JWT claims are defined that
   enable delegation semantics to be expressed, the specific syntax,
   semantics and security characteristics of the tokens themselves (both
   those presented to the AS and those obtained by the client) are
   explicitly out of scope and no requirements are placed on the trust
   model in which an implementation might be deployed.  Additional
   profiles may provide more detailed requirements around the specific
   nature of the parties and trust involved, such as whether signing
   and/or encryption of tokens is required; however, such details will
   often be policy decisions made with respect to the specific needs of
   individual deployments and will be configured or implemented
   accordingly.

   The security tokens obtained could be used in a number of contexts,
   the specifics of which are also beyond the scope of this
   specification.

1.1.  Delegation vs. Impersonation Semantics

   When principal A impersonates principal B, A is given all the rights
   that B has within some defined rights context and is
   indistinguishable from B in that context.  Thus, when principal A
   impersonates principal B, then in so far as any entity receiving such
   a token is concerned, they are actually dealing with B.  It is true
   that some members of the identity system might have awareness that
   impersonation is going on, but it is not a requirement.  For all
   intents and purposes, when A is impersonating B, A is B.

   Delegation semantics are different than impersonation semantics,
   though the two are closely related.  With delegation semantics,
   principal A still has its own identity separate from B and it is
   explicitly understood that while B may have delegated some of its
   rights to A, any actions taken are being taken by A representing B.
   In a sense, A is an agent for B.

   Delegation and impersonation are not inclusive of all situations.
   When a principal is acting directly on its own behalf, for example,
   neither delegation nor impersonation are in play.  They are, however,

Internet-Draft          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange              March 2016


   the more common semantics operating for token exchange and, as such,
   are given more direct treatment in this specification.

   Delegation semantics are typically expressed in a token by including
   information about both the primary subject of the token as well as
   the actor to whom that subject has delegated some of its rights.
   Such a token is sometimes referred to as a composite token because it
   is composed of information about multiple subjects.  A client can
   indicate the desire for a composite token by including a
   "want_composite" parameter in the request with the value "true".
   Typically, in the request, the "subject_token" represents the
   identity of the party on behalf of whom the token is being requested
   while the "actor_token" represents the identity of the party to whom
   the access rights of the issued token are being delegated.  A
   composite token issued by the authorization server will contain
   information about both parties.

   The specifics of representing a composite token and even whether or
   not such a token will be issued depend on the details of the
   implementation and the kind of token.  The representations of
   composite tokens that are not JWTs are beyond the scope of this
   specification.  The Section 4.1 request parameter, however, does
   provide a means for providing information about the desired actor
   though the representation of a chain of delegation using the JWT
   "act" claim.

1.2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "access token type", "authorization
   server", "client", "client identifier", "resource server", "token
   endpoint", "token request", and "token response" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749], and the terms "Claim" and "JWT Claims Set" defined by JSON
   Web Token (JWT) [JWT].

2.  Token Exchange Request and Response

2.1.  Request

   A client requests a security token by making a token request to the
   authorization server's token endpoint using the extension grant type
   mechanism defined in Section 4.5 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

Internet-Draft          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange              March 2016


   Client authentication to the authorization server is done using the
   normal mechanisms provided by OAuth 2.0.  Section 2.3.1 of The OAuth
   2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749] defines password-based
   authentication of the client, however, client authentication is
   extensible and other mechanisms are possible.  For example, [RFC7523]
   defines client authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [JWT].
   The supported methods of client authentication and whether or not to
   allow unauthenticated or unidentified clients are deployment
   decisions that are at the discretion of the authorization server.

   The client makes a token exchange request to the token endpoint with
   an extension grant type by including the following parameters using
   the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format with a character
   encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-body:

   grant_type
      REQUIRED.  The value "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-
      exchange" indicates that a token exchange is being performed.

   resource
      OPTIONAL.  Indicates the physical location of the target service
      or resource where the client intends to use the requested security
      token.  This enables the authorization server to apply policy as
      appropriate for the target, such as determining the type and
      content of the token to be issued or if and how the token is to be
      encrypted.  In many cases, a client will not have knowledge of the
      logical organization of the systems with which it interacts and
      will only know the location of the service where it intends to use
      the token.  The "resource" parameter allows the client to indicate
      to the authorization server where it intends to use the issued
      token by providing the location, typically as an https URL, in the
      token exchange request in the same form that will be used to
      access that resource.  The authorization server will typically
      have the capability to map from a resource URI value to an
      appropriate policy.  The value of the "resource" parameter MUST be
      an absolute URI, as specified by Section 4.3 of [RFC3986], which
      MAY include a query component and MUST NOT include a fragment
      component.  Multiple "resource" parameters may be used to indicate
      that the issued token is intended to be used at the multiple
      resources listed.

   audience
      OPTIONAL.  The logical name of the target service where the client
      intends to use the requested security token.  This serves a
      purpose similar to the "resource" parameter, but with the client
      providing a logical name rather than a physical location.
      Interpretation of the name requires that the value be something
      that both the client and the authorization server understand.  An

      OAuth client identifier, a SAML entity identifier
      [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os], an OpenID Connect Issuer Identifier
      [OpenID.Core], or a URI are examples of things that might be used
      as "audience" parameter values.  Multiple "audience" parameters
      may be used to indicate that the issued token is intended to be
      used at the multiple audiences listed.  The "audience" and
      "resource" parameters may be used together to indicate multiple
      target services with a mix of logical names and physical
      locations.

   scope
      OPTIONAL.  A list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings that
      allow the client to specify the desired scope of the requested
      security token in the context of the service or resource where the
      token will be used.

   requested_token_type
      OPTIONAL.  An identifier, as described in Section 3, for the type
      of the requested security token.  For example, a JWT can be
      requested with the identifier "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-
      type:jwt".  If the requested type is unspecified, the issued token
      type is at the discretion of the authorization server and may be
      dictated by knowledge of the requirements of the service or
      resource indicated by the "resource" or "audience" parameter.

   subject_token
      REQUIRED.  A security token that represents the identity of the
      party on behalf of whom the request is being made.  Typically, the
      subject of this token will be the subject of the security token
      issued in response to this request.

   subject_token_type
      REQUIRED.  An identifier, as described in Section 3, that
      indicates the type of the security token in the "subject_token"
      parameter.  For example, a value of "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-
      type:jwt", would indicate that the token is a JWT and a value of
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token" would indicate
      that the token is an OAuth access token.

   actor_token
      OPTIONAL.  A security token that represents the identity of the
      party that is authorized to use the requested security token and
      act on behalf of the subject.

   actor_token_type
      An identifier, as described in Section 3, that indicates the type
      of the security token in the "actor_token" parameter.  This is

Internet-Draft          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange              March 2016


      REQUIRED when the "actor_token" parameter is present in the
      request but MUST NOT be included otherwise.

   want_composite
      OPTIONAL.  When the value of this parameter is "true", it
      indicates the client's desire for a composite security token to be
      issued, which contains claims about both the main subject of the
      token as well as about the party who is authorized to act on
      behalf of that subject.  Note that this parameter only provides a
      means for the client to indicate its preference.  The
      authorization server is not required to honor the stated
      preference and the nature of the tokens it issues are ultimately
      at its discretion.

   In the absence of one-time-use or other semantics specific to the
   token type, the act of performing a token exchange has no impact on
   the validity of the subject token or actor token.

2.2.  Response

   The authorization server responds to a token exchange request with a
   normal OAuth 2.0 response from the token endpoint, as specified in
   Section 5 of [RFC6749].  Additional details and explanation are
   provided in the following subsections.

2.2.1.  Successful Response

   If the request is valid and meets all policy and other criteria of
   the authorization server, a successful token response is constructed
   by adding the following parameters to the entity-body of the HTTP
   response using the "application/json" media type, as specified by
   [RFC7159], and an HTTP 200 status code.  The parameters are
   serialized into a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) structure by
   adding each parameter at the top level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.  Numerical values are included
   as JSON numbers.  The order of parameters does not matter and can
   vary.

   access_token
      REQUIRED.  The security token issued by the authorization server
      in response to the token exchange request.  The "access_token"
      parameter from Section 5.1 of [RFC6749] is used here to carry the
      requested token, which allows this token exchange protocol to use
      the existing OAuth 2.0 request and response constructs defined for
      the token endpoint.  The identifier "access_token" is used for
      historical reasons and the issued token need not be an OAuth
      access token.

Internet-Draft          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange              March 2016


   issued_token_type
      REQUIRED.  An identifier, as described in Section 3, for the
      representation of the issued security token.  For example, a value
      of "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token" indicates that
      the issued token is an access token and a value of
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt" indicates that it is a JWT.

   token_type
      REQUIRED.  A case-insensitive value specifying the method of using
      of the access token issued, as specified in Section 7.1 of
      [RFC6749].  It provides the client with information about how to
      utilize the access token to access protected resources.  For
      example, a value of "Bearer", as specified in [RFC6750], indicates
      that the security token is a bearer token and the client can
      simply present it as is without any additional proof of
      eligibility beyond the contents of the token itself.  Note that
      the meaning of this parameter is different from the meaning of the
      "issued_token_type" parameter, which declares the representation
      of the issued security token; the term "token type" is typically
      used with this meaning, as it is in all "*_token_type" parameters
      in this specification.  If the issued token is not an access token
      or usable as an access token, then the "token_type" value "N_A" is
      used to indicate that an OAuth 2.0 "token_type" identifier is not
      applicable in that context.

   expires_in
      RECOMMENDED.  The validity lifetime, in seconds, of the token
      issued by the authorization server.  Oftentimes the client will
      not have the inclination or capability to inspect the content of
      the token and this parameter provides a consistent and token type
      agnostic indication of how long the token can be expected to be
      valid.  For example, the value 1800 denotes that the token will
      expire in thirty minutes from the time the response was generated.

   scope
      OPTIONAL, if the scope of the issued security token is identical
      to the scope requested by the client; otherwise, REQUIRED.

   refresh_token
      NOT RECOMMENDED.  Refresh tokens will typically not be issued in
      response to "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange"
      grant type requests.  Typically, a token exchange is done to
      exchange one temporary credential (the subject_token sent in the
      request) for a different temporary credential (the issued token)
      that can be used in some other context.  Issuing a refresh token
      would add an additional credential that likely has a much longer
      lifetime, which undermines the typical model of swapping temporary
      credentials.  Profiles or deployments of this specification that

      do issue refresh tokens SHOULD clearly document the conditions and
      reasons for doing so.

2.2.2.  Error Response

   If either the "subject_token" or "actor_token" are invalid for any
   reason, or are unacceptable based on policy, the authorization server
   MUST construct an error response, as specified in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC6749].  The value of the "error" parameter MUST be the
   "invalid_request" error code.  The authorization server MAY include
   additional information regarding the reasons for the error using the
   "error_description" and/or "error_uri" parameters.  Other error codes
   may also be used, as appropriate.

2.3.  Example Token Exchange

   The following example demonstrates a hypothetical token exchange in
   which an OAuth resource server assumes the role of the client during
   token exchange in order to trade an access token that it received in
   a request for a token that it will use to call to a backend service
   (extra line breaks and indentation in the examples are for display
   purposes only).

   The resource server receives the following request containing an
   OAuth access token in the Authorization request header, as specified
   in Section 2.1 of [RFC6750].

    GET /resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: frontend.example.com
    Authorization: Bearer accVkjcJyb4BWCxGsndESCJQbdFMogUC5PbRDqceLTC

                   Figure 1: Protected Resource Request

   The resource server assumes the role of the client for the token
   exchange and the access token from the request above is sent to the
   authorization server using a request as specified in Section 2.1.
   The value of the "subject_token" parameter carries the access token
   and the value of the "subject_token_type" parameter indicates that it
   is an OAuth 2.0 access token.  The resource server, acting as the
   client, uses its identifier and secret to authenticate to the
   authorization server using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme.  The
   "resource" parameter indicates the location of the backend service,
   https://backend.example.com/api, where the issued token will be used.

                     Figure 2: Token Exchange Request

   The authorization server validates the client credentials and the
   "subject_token" presented in the token exchange request.  From the
   "resource" parameter, the authorization server is able to determine
   the appropriate policy to apply to the request and issues a token
   suitable for use at https://backend.example.com.  The "access_token"
   parameter of the response contains the new token, which is itself a
   bearer OAuth access token that is valid for one minute.  The token
   happens to be a JWT; however, its structure and format are opaque to
   the client so the "issued_token_type" indicates only that it is an
   access token.

3.  Token Type Identifiers

   Several parameters in this specification utilize an identifier as the
   value to describe the type of token in question.  Specifically, they
   are the "requested_token_type", "subject_token_type",
   "actor_token_type" parameters of the request and the
   "issued_token_type" member of the response.  Token type identifiers
   are URIs.

   This specification defines the token type identifiers
   "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token" and
   "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token" to indicate that the
   token is an OAuth 2.0 access token or refresh token, respectively.
   The value "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt" defined in Section 9
   of [JWT] indicates that the token is a JWT.  This specification also
   defines the token type identifier "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-
   type:id_token" to indicate that the token is an ID Token, as defined
   in Section 2 of [OpenID.Core].  Other URIs to indicate other token
   types MAY be used.

4.  JSON Web Token Claims

   It is useful to have defined mechanisms to express delegation within
   a token as well as to express authorization to delegate or
   impersonate.  Although the token exchange protocol described herein
   can be used with any type of token, this section defines claims to
   express such semantics specifically for JWTs.  Similar definitions
   for other types of tokens are possible but beyond the scope of this
   specification.

4.1.  "act" (Actor) Claim

   The "act" (actor) claim provides a means within a JWT to express that
   delegation has occurred and identify the acting party to whom
   authority has been delegated.  The "act" claim value is a JSON object



Jones, et al.           Expires September 5, 2016              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange              March 2016


   and members in the JSON object are claims that identify the actor.
   The claims that make up the "act" claim identify and possibly provide
   additional information about the actor.  For example, the combination
   of the two claims "iss" and "sub" might be necessary to uniquely
   identify an actor.

   However, claims within the "act" claim pertain only to the identity
   of the actor and are not relevant to the validity of the containing
   JWT in the same manner as the top-level claims.  Consequently, claims
   such as "exp", "nbf", and "aud" are not meaningful when used within
   an "act" claim, and therefore should not be used.

   The following example illustrates the "act" (actor) claim within a
   JWT Claims Set.  The claims of the token itself are about
   user@example.com while the "act" claim indicates that
   admin@example.com is the current actor.

    {
      "aud":"https://consumer.example.com",
      "iss":"https://issuer.example.com",
      "exp":1443904177,
      "nbf":1443904077,
      "sub":"user@example.com",
      "act":
      {
        "sub":"admin@example.com"
      }
    }

                           Figure 5: Actor Claim

   A chain of delegation can be expressed by nesting one "act" claim
   within another.  The outermost "act" claim represents the current
   actor while nested "act" claims represent prior actors.  The least
   recent actor is the most deeply nested.

Internet-Draft          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange              March 2016


   The following example illustrates nested "act" (actor) claims within
   a JWT Claims Set.  The claims of the token itself are about
   user@example.com while the "act" claim indicates that the system
   consumer.example.com-web-application is the current actor and
   admin@example.com was a prior actor.  Such a token might come about
   as the result of the web application receiving a token like the one
   in the previous example and exchanging it for a new token that lists
   it as the current actor and that can be used at
   https://backend.example.com.

    {
      "aud":"https://backend.example.com",
      "iss":"https://issuer.example.com",
      "exp":1443904100,
      "nbf":1443904000,
      "sub":"user@example.com",
      "act":
      {
        "sub":"consumer.example.com-web-application",
        "iss":"https://issuer.example.net",
        "act":
        {
          "sub":"admin@example.com"
        }
      }
    }

                       Figure 6: Nested Actor Claim

4.2.  "scp" (Scopes) Claim

   The "scp" claim is an array of strings, each of which represents an
   OAuth scope granted for the issued security token.  Each array entry
   of the claim value is a scope-token, as defined in Section 3.3 of
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   The following example illustrates the "scp" claim within a JWT Claims
   Set with four scope-tokens.

    {
      "aud":"https://consumer.example.com",
      "iss":"https://issuer.example.com",
      "exp":1443904177,
      "nbf":1443904077,
      "sub":"dgaf4mvfs75Fci_FL3heQA",
      "scp":["email","address","profile","phone"]
    }

                          Figure 7: Scopes Claim

4.3.  "may_act" (May Act For) Claim

   The "may_act" claim makes a statement that one party is authorized to
   become the actor and act on behalf of another party.  The claim value
   is a JSON object and members in the JSON object are claims that
   identify the party that is asserted as being eligible to act for the
   party identified by the JWT containing the claim.  The claims that
   make up the "may_act" claim identify and possibly provide additional
   information about the authorized actor.  For example, the combination
   of the two claims "iss" and "sub" are sometimes necessary to uniquely
   identify an authorized actor, while the "email" claim might be used
   to provide additional useful information about that party.

   However, claims within the "may_act" claim pertain only to the
   identity of that party and are not relevant to the validity of the
   containing JWT in the same manner as top level claims.  Consequently,
   claims such as "exp", "nbf", and "aud" are not meaningful when used
   within a "may_act" claim, and therefore should not be used.

   user@example.com while the "may_act" claim indicates that
   admin@example.com is authorized to act on behalf of user@example.com.

   All of the normal security issues that are discussed in [JWT],
   especially in relationship to comparing URIs and dealing with
   unrecognized values, also apply here.

   In addition, both delegation and impersonation introduce unique
   security issues.  Any time one principal is delegated the rights of
   another principal, the potential for abuse is a concern.  The use of
   the "scp" claim is suggested to mitigate potential for such abuse, as
   it restricts the contexts in which the delegated rights can be
   exercised.

Appendix A.  Additional Token Exchange Examples

   Two example token exchanges are provided in the following sections
   illustrating impersonation and delegation, respectively (with extra
   line breaks and indentation for display purposes only).

A.1.  Impersonation Token Exchange Example

A.1.1.  Token Exchange Request

   In the following token exchange request, an anonymous client is
   requesting a token with impersonation semantics.  The client tells
   the authorization server that it needs a token for use at the target
   service with the logical name "urn:example:cooperation-context".

A.1.2.  Subject Token Claims

   The "subject_token" in the prior request is a JWT and the decoded JWT
   Claims Set is shown here.  The JWT is intended for consumption by the
   authorization server within a specific time window.  The subject of
   the JWT ("bc@example.net") is the party on behalf of whom the new
   token is being requested.

A.1.3.  Token Exchange Response

   The "access_token" parameter of the token exchange response shown
   below contains the new token that the client requested.  The other
   parameters of the response indicate that the token is a bearer access
   token that expires in an hour.

A.1.4.  Issued Token Claims

   The decoded JWT Claims Set of the issued token is shown below.  The
   new JWT is issued by the authorization server and intended for
   consumption by a system entity known by the logical name
   "urn:example:cooperation-context" any time before its expiration.
   The subject ("sub") of the JWT is the same as the subject the token
   used to make the request, which effectively enables the client to
   impersonate that subject at the system entity known by the logical
   name of "urn:example:cooperation-context" by using the token.

A.2.3.  Actor Token Claims

   The "actor_token" in the prior request is a JWT and the decoded JWT
   Claims Set is shown here.  This JWT is also intended for consumption
   by the authorization server before a specific expiration time.  The
   subject of the JWT ("admin@example.net") is the actor that will wield
   the security token being requested.

   "urn:example:cooperation-context" any time before its expiration.
   The subject ("sub") of the JWT is the same as the subject of the
   "subject_token" used to make the request.  The actor ("act") of the
   JWT is the same as the subject of the "actor_token" used to make the
   request.  This indicates delegation and identifies
   "admin@example.net" as the current actor to whom authority has been
   delegated to act on behalf of "user@example.net".

Appendix B.  Acknowledgements

   This specification was developed within the OAuth Working Group,
   which includes dozens of active and dedicated participants.  It was
   produced under the chairmanship of Hannes Tschofenig and Derek Atkins
   with Kathleen Moriarty and Stephen Farrell serving as Security Area
   Directors.  The following individuals contributed ideas, feedback,
   and wording to this specification:

   Caleb Baker, William Denniss, Vladimir Dzhuvinov, Phil Hunt, Jason
   Keglovitz, Nov Matake, Matt Miller, Matthew Perry, Justin Richer,
   Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, Scott Tomilson, and Hannes Tschofenig.

Appendix C.  Open Issues

   The following decisions need to be made and updates to this spec
   performed:

   o  Should there be a way to use short names for some common token
      type identifiers?  URIs are necessary in the general case for
      extensibility and vendor/deployment specific types.  But short
      names like "access_token" and "jwt" are aesthetically appealing
      and slightly more efficient in terms of bytes on the wire and url-
      encoding.  There seemed to be rough consensus in Prague ('No
      objection to use the proposed mechanism for a default prefix' from
      https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-oauth) for



Jones, et al.           Expires September 5, 2016              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft          OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange              March 2016


      supporting a shorthand for commonly used types - i.e. when the
      value does not contain a ":" character, the value would be treated
      as though "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:" were prepended to
      it.  So, for example, the value "jwt" for "requested_token_type"
      would be semantically equivalent to "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-
      type:jwt" and the value "access_token" would be equivalent to
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token".  However, it was
      a fairly brief discussion in Prague and it has since been
      suggested that making participants handle both syntaxes will
      unnecessarily complicate the supporting code.

   o  Provide a way to include supplementary claims or information in
      the request that would/could potentially be included in the issued
      token.  There are real use cases for this but we would need to
      work through what it would look like.

   o  Understand and define exactly how the presentation of PoP/non-
      bearer tokens works.  Of course, the specifications defining these
      kinds of tokens need to do so first before there is much we can do
      in this specification in this regard.

   o  It seems there may be cases in which it would be desirable for the
      authenticated client to be somehow represented in the issued
      token, sometimes in addition to the actor, which can already be
      represented using the "act" claim.  Perhaps with a "client_id"
      claim?

   o  Clarified that the "resource" and "audience" request parameters
      can be used at the same time (via http://www.ietf.org/mail-
      archive/web/oauth/current/msg15335.html).
   o  Clarified subject/actor token validity after token exchange and
      explained a bit more about the recommendation to not issue refresh
      tokens (via http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/
      msg15318.html).
   o  Updated the examples appendix to use an issuer value that doesn't
      imply that the client issued and signed the tokens and used
      "Bearer" and "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token" in
      one of the responses (via http://www.ietf.org/mail-
      archive/web/oauth/current/msg15335.html).
   o  Defined and registered urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token,
      since some use cases perform token exchanges for ID Tokens and no

      defined.

   -03

   o  Updated the document editors (adding Campbell, Bradley, and
      Mortimore).
   o  Added to the title.
   o  Added to the abstract and introduction.
   o  Updated the format of the request to use application/x-www-form-
      urlencoded request parameters and the response to use the existing
      token endpoint JSON parameters defined in OAuth 2.0.
   o  Changed the grant type identifier to urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-
      type:token-exchange.
   o  Added RFC 6755 registration requests for
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token,
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token, and
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange.
   o  Added RFC 6749 registration requests for request/response
      parameters.
   o  Removed the Implementation Considerations and the requirement to
      support JWTs.
   o  Clarified many aspects of the text.
   o  Changed "on_behalf_of" to "subject_token",
      "on_behalf_of_token_type" to "subject_token_type", "act_as" to
      "actor_token", and "act_as_token_type" to "actor_token_type".
   o  Added an "audience" request parameter used to indicate the logical
      names of the target services at which the client intends to use
      the requested security token.
   o  Added a "want_composite" request parameter used to indicate the
      desire for a composite token rather than trying to infer it from
      the presence/absence of token(s) in the request.
   o  Added a "resource" request parameter used to indicate the URLs of
      resources at which the client intends to use the requested
      security token.
   o  Specified that multiple "audience" and "resource" request
      parameter values may be used.
   o  Defined the JWT claim "act" (actor) to express the current actor
      or delegation principal.
   o  Defined the JWT claim "may_act" to express that one party is
      authorized to act on behalf of another party.
   o  Defined the JWT claim "scp" (scopes) to express OAuth 2.0 scope-
      token values.
   o  Added the "N_A" (not applicable) OAuth Access Token Type
      definition for use in contexts in which the token exchange syntax
      requires a "token_type" value, but in which the token being issued
      is not an access token.
   o  Added examples.
