   PCEP Procedures and Protocol Extensions for Using PCE as a Central
                       Controller (PCECC) of LSPs
          draft-ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller-14

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.

   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the LSP can be
   calculated/set up/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also
   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device
   along the path, while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as
   much as possible.

   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions for using
   the PCE as the central controller for provisioning labels along the
   path of the static LSP.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] was developed to offload
   the path computation function from routers in an MPLS traffic-
   engineered network.  It can compute optimal paths for traffic across
   a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the
   network or traffic demands.  Since then, the role and function of the
   PCE has grown to cover a number of other uses (such as GMPLS
   [RFC7025]) and to allow delegated control [RFC8231] and PCE-initiated
   use of network resources [RFC8281].

   According to [RFC7399], Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a
   separation between the control elements and the forwarding components
   so that software running in a centralized system, called a
   controller, can act to program the devices in the network to behave
   in specific ways.  A required element in an SDN architecture is a
   component that plans how the network resources will be used and how
   the devices will be programmed.  It is possible to view this
   component as performing specific computations to place traffic flows
   within the network given knowledge of the availability of network
   resources, how other forwarding devices are programmed, and the way

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2021


   that other flows are routed.  This is the function and purpose of a
   PCE, and the way that a PCE integrates into a wider network control
   system (including an SDN system) is presented in [RFC7491].

   In early PCE implementations, where the PCE was used to derive paths
   for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), paths were requested by network
   elements (known as Path Computation Clients (PCCs)), and the results
   of the path computations were supplied to network elements using the
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].
   This protocol was later extended to allow a PCE to send unsolicited
   requests to the network for LSP establishment [RFC8281].

   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  But SDN has a
   broader applicability than signaled MPLS and GMPLS traffic-engineered
   (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range
   of use cases.  PCEP has been proposed as a control protocol for use
   in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a
   central controller.

   [RFC8283] introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller
   as an extension of the architecture described in [RFC4655] and
   assumes the continued use of PCEP as the protocol used between PCE
   and PCC.  [RFC8283] further examines the motivations and
   applicability for PCEP as a Southbound Interface (SBI), and
   introduces the implications for the protocol.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases] describes the use cases for the PCECC
   architecture.

   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the LSP can be
   calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also
   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device
   along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much
   as possible.

   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions for using
   the PCE as the central controller for static LSPs, where LSPs can be
   provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-
   end path.  Each router along the path must be told what label-
   forwarding instructions to program and what resources to reserve.
   The PCE-based controller keeps a view of the network and determines
   the paths of the end-to-end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to
   communicate with each router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

   While this document is focused on the procedures for the static LSPs
   (referred to as basic PCECC mode in Section 3), the mechanisms and
   protocol encodings are specified in such a way that extensions for
   other use cases are easy to achieve.  For example, the extensions for
   PCECC for Segment Routing (SR) are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] and
   [I-D.dhody-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-srv6].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is the same as that described
   in the [RFC8283].

3.  Basic PCECC Mode

   In this mode, LSPs are provisioned as explicit label instructions at
   each hop on the end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be
   told what label forwarding instructions to program and what resources
   to reserve.  The controller uses PCEP to communicate with each router
   along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

   [RFC8283] examines the motivations and applicability for PCECC and
   use of PCEP as an SBI.  Section 3.1.2. of [RFC8283] highlights the
   use of PCECC for label allocation along the static LSPs and it
   simplifies the processing of a distributed control plane by blending
   it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing
   it.  This allows the operator to introduce the advantages of SDN
   (such as programmability) into the network.  Further Section 3.3. of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases] describes some of the scenarios where
   the PCECC technique could be useful.  Section 4 of [RFC8283] also
   describe the implications on the protocol when used as an SDN SBI.
   The operator needs to evaluate the advantages offered by PCECC
   against the operational and scalability needs of the PCECC.

   As per Section 3.1.2. of [RFC8283], the PCE-based controller will
   take responsibility for managing some part of the MPLS label space
   for each of the routers that it controls, and may take wider
   responsibility for partitioning the label space for each router and
   allocating different parts for different uses.  The PCC MUST NOT make
   allocations from the label space set aside for the PCE to avoid

   overlap and collisions of label allocations.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   PCE makes allocations (from the label space set aside for the PCE)
   for all nodes along the path.  For the purpose of this document, it
   is assumed that the exclusive label range to be used by a PCE is
   known and set on both PCEP peers.  A future extension could add the
   capability to advertise this range via a possible PCEP extension as
   well (see [I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space]).  The rest of the
   processing is similar to the existing stateful PCE mechanism.

   This document also allows a case where the label space is maintained
   by the PCC and the labels are allocated by it.  In this case, the PCE
   should request the allocation from PCC as described in Section 5.5.8.

4.  PCEP Requirements

   The following key requirements should be considered when designing
   the PCECC-based solution:

   1.  A PCEP speaker supporting this document needs to have the
       capability to advertise its PCECC capability to its peers.

   2.  A PCEP speaker need means to identify PCECC-based LSP in the PCEP
       messages.

   3.  PCEP procedures need to allow for PCC-based label allocations.

   4.  PCEP procedures need to provide a means to update (or clean up)
       label entries downloaded to the PCC.

   5.  PCEP procedures need to provide a means to synchronize the labels
       between the PCE and the PCC via PCEP messages.

5.  Procedures for Using the PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC)

5.1.  Stateful PCE Model

   Active stateful PCE is described in [RFC8231].  PCE as a central
   controller (PCECC) reuses the existing active stateful PCE mechanism
   as much as possible to control LSPs.

5.2.  New LSP Functions

   Several new functions are required in PCEP to support PCECC.  This
   document extends the existing messages to support the new functions
   required by PCECC:

   PCInitiate:  a PCEP message described in [RFC8281].  PCInitiate
      message is used to set up PCE-Initiated LSP based on PCECC

      mechanism.  It is also extended for Central Controller
      Instructions (CCI) (download or clean up the Label forwarding
      instructions in the context of this document) on all nodes along
      the path as described in Section 6.1.

   PCRpt:  a PCEP message described in [RFC8231].  PCRpt message is used
      to send PCECC LSP Reports.  It is also extended to report the set
      of Central Controller Instructions (CCI) (label forwarding
      instructions in the context of this document) received from the
      PCE as described in Section 6.2.  Section 5.5.6 describes the use
      of PCRpt message during synchronization.

   PCUpd:  a PCEP message described in [RFC8231].  PCUpd message is used
      to send PCECC LSP Updates.

   The new functions defined in this document are mapped onto the PCEP
   messages as shown in Table 1.

              Table 1: Functions mapped to the PCEP messages

5.3.  New PCEP Object

   This document defines a new PCEP object called CCI (Section 7.3) to
   specify the central controller instructions.  In the scope of this
   document, this is limited to Label forwarding instructions.  Future
   documents can create new CCI object-types for other types of central
   controller instructions.  The CC-ID is the unique identifier for the
   central controller instructions in PCEP.  The PCEP messages are
   extended in this document to handle the PCECC operations.

5.4.  PCECC Capability Advertisement

   During the PCEP Initialization Phase, PCEP Speakers (PCE or PCC)
   advertise their support of and willingness to use PCEP extensions for
   PCECC using these elements in the OPEN message:

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2021


   o  A new Path Setup Type (PST) (Section 7.2) in the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
      CAPABILITY TLV to indicate support for PCEP extensions for PCECC -
      TBD1 (Path is set up via PCECC mode)

   o  A new PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV (Section 7.1.1) with the L bit set
      to 1 inside the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV to indicate a
      willingness to use PCEP extensions for PCECC based central
      controller instructions for label download

   o  The STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV ([RFC8231]) (with the I flag set
      [RFC8281])

   The new Path Setup Type is to be listed in the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV by all PCEP speakers which support the PCEP extensions
   for PCECC in this document.

   The new PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is included in PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN object to indicate a willingness to use
   the PCEP extensions for PCECC during the established PCEP session.
   Using the L bit in this TLV, the PCE shows the intention to function
   as a PCECC server, and the PCC shows a willingness to act as a PCECC
   client for label download instructions (see Section 7.1.1).

   If the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is advertised and the STATEFUL-PCE-
   CAPABILITY TLV is not advertised, or is advertised without the I flag
   set, in the OPEN Object, the receiver MUST:

   o  Send a PCErr message with Error-Type=19 (Invalid Operation) and
      Error-value=TBD4 (stateful PCE capability was not advertised)

   o  Terminate the session

   If a PCEP speaker receives the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV with
   the PCECC Path Setup Type but without the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV,
   it MUST:

   o  Send a PCErr message with Error-Type 10 (Reception of an invalid
      object) and Error-Value TBD2 (Missing PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV)

   o  Terminate the PCEP session

   The PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV MUST NOT be used without the
   corresponding Path Setup Type being listed in the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV.  If it is present without the corresponding Path
   Setup Type listed in the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV, it MUST be

   If one or both speakers (PCE and PCC) have not indicated support and
   willingness to use the PCEP extensions for PCECC, the PCEP extensions
   for PCECC MUST NOT be used.  If a PCECC operation is attempted when
   both speakers have not agreed in the OPEN messages, the receiver of
   the message MUST:

   o  Send a PCErr message with Error-Type=19 (Invalid Operation) and
      Error-Value=TBD3 (Attempted PCECC operations when PCECC capability
      was not advertised)

   o  Terminate the PCEP session

   A legacy PCEP speaker (that does not recognize the PCECC Capability
   sub-TLV) will ignore the sub-TLV in accordance with [RFC8408] and
   [RFC5440].  As per [RFC8408], the legacy PCEP speaker on receipt of
   an unsupported PST in RP (Request Parameter) /SRP (Stateful PCE
   Request Parameters) Object will:

   o  Send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 21 (Invalid traffic
      engineering path setup type) and Error-value = 1 (Unsupported path
      setup type)

   o  Terminate the PCEP session

5.5.  LSP Operations

   The PCEP messages pertaining to a PCECC MUST include PATH-SETUP-TYPE
   TLV [RFC8408] in the SRP object [RFC8231] with PST set to TBD1 to
   clearly identify that PCECC LSP is intended.

5.5.1.  PCE-Initiated PCECC LSP

   The LSP Instantiation operation is defined in [RFC8281].  In order to
   set up a PCE-Initiated LSP based on the PCECC mechanism, a PCE sends
   PCInitiate message with PST set to TBD1 for PCECC (see Section 7.2)
   to the ingress PCC.

   The label forwarding instructions (see Section 5.5.3) from PCECC are
   sent after the initial PCInitiate and PCRpt message exchange with the
   ingress PCC as per [RFC8281] (see Figure 1).  This is done so that
   the PLSP-ID and other LSP identifiers can be obtained from the
   ingress and can be included in the label forwarding instruction in
   the next set of PCInitiate messages along the path as described
   below.

   An LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV [RFC8231] MUST be included for PCECC LSPs, it
   uniquely identifies the LSP in the network.  Note that the fields in
   the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV are described for the RSVP-signaled LSPs but

   are applicable to the PCECC LSP as well.  The LSP object is included
   in the central controller instructions (label download Section 7.3)
   to identify the PCECC LSP for this instruction.  The PLSP-ID is the
   original identifier used by the ingress PCC, so a transit/egress LSR
   could have multiple central controller instructions that have the
   same PLSP-ID.  The PLSP-ID in combination with the source (in LSP-
   IDENTIFIERS TLV) MUST be unique.  The PLSP-ID is included for
   maintainability reasons to ease debugging.  As per [RFC8281], the LSP
   object could also include the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV to identify the
   PCE that initiated these instructions.  Also, the CC-ID is unique in
   each PCEP session as described in Section 7.3.

   On receipt of PCInitiate message for the PCECC LSP, the PCC responds
   with a PCRpt message with the status set to "GOING-UP" and carrying
   the assigned PLSP-ID (see Figure 1).  The ingress PCC also sets the D
   (Delegate) flag (see [RFC8231]) and C (Create) flag (see [RFC8281])
   in the LSP object.  When the PCE receives this PCRpt message with the
   PLSP-ID, it assigns labels along the path; and sets up the path by
   sending a PCInitiate message to each node along the path of the LSP
   as per the PCECC technique.  The CC-ID uniquely identifies the
   central controller instruction within a PCEP session.  Each node
   along the path (PCC) responds with a PCRpt message to acknowledge the
   central controller instruction with the PCRpt messages including the
   central controller instruction (CCI) and the LSP objects.

   The ingress node would receive one CCI object with O bit (out-label)
   set.  The transit node(s) would receive two CCI objects with the in-
   label CCI without an O bit set and the out-label CCI with O bit set.
   The egress node would receive one CCI object without O bit set (see
   Figure 1).  A node can determine its role based on the setting of the
   O bit in the CCI object(s) and the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV in the LSP
   object.

   The LSP deletion operation for PCE-Initiated PCECC LSP is the same as
   defined in [RFC8281].  The PCE should further perform Label entry
   clean up operation as described in Section 5.5.3.2 for the
   corresponding LSP.

   The PCE-Initiated PCECC LSP setup sequence is shown in Figure 1.

   Once the label operations are completed, the PCE MUST send a PCUpd
   message to the ingress PCC.  The PCUpd message is as per [RFC8231]
   with D flag set.

   The PCECC LSPs are considered to be 'up' by default (on receipt of
   PCUpd message from PCE).  The ingress could further choose to deploy
   a data plane check mechanism and report the status back to the PCE
   via a PCRpt message to make sure that the correct label instructions
   are made along the path of the PCECC LSP (and it is ready to carry
   traffic).  The exact mechanism is out of scope of this document.

   In the case where the label allocations are made by the PCC itself
   (see Section 5.5.8), the PCE could request an allocation to be made
   by the PCC, and then the PCC would send a PCRpt with the allocated
   label encoded in the CC-ID object as shown in Figure 2 in the
   configuration sequence from the egress towards the ingress along the
   path.

   It should be noted that in this example, the request is made to the
   egress node with the C bit set in the CCI object to indicate that the
   label allocation needs to be done by the egress and the egress
   responds with the allocated label to the PCE.  The PCE further inform
   the transit PCC without setting the C bit to 1 in the CCI object for
   out-label but the C bit is set to 1 for in-label so the transit node
   make the label allocation (for the in-label) and report to the PCE.
   Similarly, the C bit is unset towards the ingress to complete all the
   label allocation for the PCECC LSP.

5.5.2.  PCC-Initiated PCECC LSP

   In order to set up an LSP based on the PCECC mechanism where the LSP
   is configured at the PCC, a PCC MUST delegate the LSP by sending a

   PCRpt message with PST set for PCECC (see Section 7.2) and D
   (Delegate) flag (see [RFC8231]) set in the LSP object (see Figure 3).

   When a PCE receives the initial PCRpt message with D flag and PST
   Type set to TBD1, it SHOULD calculate the path and assigns labels
   along the path; and sets up the path by sending a PCInitiate message
   to each node along the path of the LSP as per the PCECC technique
   (see Figure 3).  The CC-ID uniquely identifies the central controller
   instruction within a PCEP session.  Each PCC further responds with
   the PCRpt messages including the central controller instruction (CCI)
   and the LSP objects.

   Once the central controller instructions (label operations) are
   completed, the PCE MUST send the PCUpd message to the ingress PCC.
   As per [RFC8231], this PCUpd message should include the path
   information calculated by the PCE.

   Note that the PCECC LSPs MUST be delegated to a PCE at all times.

   The LSP deletion operation for PCECC LSPs is the same as defined in
   [RFC8231].  If the PCE receives a PCRpt message for LSP deletion then
   it does label clean up operation as described in Section 5.5.3.2 for
   the corresponding LSP.

   The Basic PCECC LSP setup sequence is as shown in Figure 3.

            Figure 4: PCC-Initiated PCECC LSP (PCC allocation)

   In the case where the label allocations are made by the PCC itself
   (see Section 5.5.8), the procedure remains the same, with just an
   additional constraint on the configuration sequence.

   The rest of the PCC-Initiated PCECC LSP setup operations are the same
   as those described in Section 5.5.1.

5.5.3.  Central Controller Instructions

   The new central controller instructions (CCI) for the label
   operations in PCEP are done via the PCInitiate message (Section 6.1),
   by defining a new PCEP Object for CCI operations.  The local label
   range of each PCC is assumed to be known by both the PCC and the PCE.

5.5.3.1.  Label Download CCI

   In order to set up an LSP based on PCECC, the PCE sends a PCInitiate
   message to each node along the path to download the Label instruction
   as described in Section 5.5.1 and Section 5.5.2.

   The CCI object MUST be included, along with the LSP object in the
   PCInitiate message.  The LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV MUST be included in the
   LSP object.  The SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV SHOULD be included in the LSP
   object.

   If a node (PCC) receives a PCInitiate message which includes a Label
   to download, as part of CCI, that is out of the range set aside for
   the PCE, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=TBD5 (PCECC
   failure) and Error-value=TBD6 (Label out of range) and MUST include
   the SRP object to specify the error is for the corresponding label
   update via PCInitiate message.  If a PCC receives a PCInitiate
   message but fails to download the Label entry, it MUST send a PCErr
   message with Error-type=TBD5 (PCECC failure) and Error-value=TBD7
   (instruction failed) and MUST include the SRP object to specify the
   error is for the corresponding label update via PCInitiate message.

   A new PCEP object for central controller instructions (CCI) is
   defined in Section 7.3.

5.5.3.2.  Label Clean up CCI

   In order to delete an LSP based on PCECC, the PCE sends a central
   controller instructions via a PCInitiate message to each node along
   the path of the LSP to clean up the Label forwarding instruction.

   If the PCC receives a PCInitiate message but does not recognize the
   label in the CCI, the PCC MUST generate a PCErr message with Error-
   Type 19(Invalid operation) and Error-Value=TBD8, "Unknown Label" and
   MUST include the SRP object to specify the error is for the
   corresponding label clean up (via PCInitiate message).

   The R flag in the SRP object defined in [RFC8281] specifies the
   deletion of Label Entry in the PCInitiate message.

                          Figure 5: Label Cleanup

   As per [RFC8281], following the removal of the Label forwarding
   instruction, the PCC MUST send a PCRpt message.  The SRP object in
   the PCRpt MUST include the SRP-ID-number from the PCInitiate message
   that triggered the removal.  The R flag in the SRP object MUST be
   set.

   In the case where the label allocation is made by the PCC itself (see
   Section 5.5.8), the removal procedure remains the same, adding the
   sequence constraint.

5.5.4.  PCECC LSP Update

   The update is done as per the make-before-break procedures, i.e. the
   PCECC first updates new label instructions based on the updated path
   and then informs the ingress to switch traffic, before cleaning up
   the former instructions.  New CC-IDs are used to identify the updated
   instructions; the identifiers in the LSP object uniquely identify the
   existing LSP.  Once new instructions are downloaded, the PCE further
   updates the new path at the ingress which triggers the traffic switch

   on the updated path.  The ingress PCC acknowledges with a PCRpt
   message, on receipt of the PCRpt message, the PCE does clean up
   operation for the former LSP as described in Section 5.5.3.2.

   The PCECC LSP Update sequence is shown in Figure 6.

   The modified PCECC LSPs are considered to be 'up' by default.  The
   ingress could further choose to deploy a data plane check mechanism

   and report the status back to the PCE via a PCRpt message.  The exact
   mechanism is out of scope of this document.

   In the case where the label allocations are made by the PCC itself
   (see Section 5.5.8), the procedure remains the same.

5.5.5.  Re-Delegation and Clean up

   As described in [RFC8281], a new PCE can gain control over an
   orphaned LSP.  In the case of a PCECC LSP, the new PCE MUST also gain
   control over the central controller instructions in the same way by
   sending a PCInitiate message that includes the SRP, LSP, and CCI
   objects and carries the CC-ID and PLSP-ID identifying the instruction
   that it wants to take control of.

   Further, as described in [RFC8281], the State Timeout Interval timer
   ensures that a PCE crash does not result in automatic and immediate
   disruption for the services using PCE-initiated LSPs.  Similarly the
   central controller instructions are not removed immediately upon PCE
   failure.  Instead, they are cleaned up on the expiration of this
   timer.  This allows for network clean up without manual intervention.
   The PCC MUST support the removal of CCI as one of the behaviors
   applied on expiration of the State Timeout Interval timer.

   In case of PCC-initiated PCECC LSP, the control over the orphaned LSP
   at the ingress PCC is taken over by the mechanism specified in
   [RFC8741] to request delegation.  The control over the central
   controller instructions is described above using [RFC8281].

5.5.6.  Synchronization of Central Controllers Instructions

   The purpose of Central Controllers Instructions synchronization
   (labels in the context of this document) is to make sure that the
   PCE's view of CCI (Labels) matches with the PCC's Label allocation.
   This synchronization is performed as part of the LSP state
   synchronization as described in [RFC8231] and [RFC8232].

   As per LSP State Synchronization [RFC8231], a PCC reports the state
   of its LSPs to the PCE using PCRpt messages and as per [RFC8281], PCE
   would initiate any missing LSPs and/or remove any LSPs that are not
   wanted.  The same PCEP messages and procedures are also used for the
   Central Controllers Instructions synchronization.  The PCRpt message
   includes the CCI and the LSP object to report the label forwarding
   instructions.  The PCE would further remove any unwanted instructions
   or initiate any missing instructions.

5.5.7.  PCECC LSP State Report

   As mentioned before, an ingress PCC MAY choose to apply any OAM
   mechanism to check the status of LSP in the Data plane and MAY
   further send its status in a PCRpt message to the PCE.

5.5.8.  PCC-Based Allocations

   The PCE can request the PCC to allocate the label using the
   PCInitiate message.  The C flag in the CCI object is set to 1 to
   indicate that the allocation needs to be done by the PCC.  The PCC
   MUST try to allocate the Label and MUST report to the PCE via PCRpt
   or PCErr message.

   If the value of the Label is 0 and the C flag is set to 1, it
   indicates that the PCE is requesting the allocation to be done by the
   PCC.  If the Label is 'n' and the C flag is set to 1 in the CCI
   object, it indicates that the PCE requests a specific value 'n' for
   the Label.  If the allocation is successful, the PCC MUST report via
   the PCRpt message with the CCI object.  If the value of the Label in
   the CCI object is invalid, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type = TBD5 ("PCECC failure") and Error Value = TBD9 ("Invalid CCI").
   If it is valid but the PCC is unable to allocate it, it MUST send a
   PCErr message with Error-Type = TBD5 ("PCECC failure") and Error
   Value = TBD10 ("Unable to allocate the specified CCI").

   If the PCC wishes to withdraw or modify the previously assigned
   label, it MUST send a PCRpt message without any Label or with the
   Label containing the new value respectively in the CCI object.  The
   PCE would further trigger the Label cleanup of older label as per
   Section 5.5.3.2.

6.  PCEP Messages

   As defined in [RFC5440], a PCEP message consists of a common header
   followed by a variable-length body made of a set of objects that can
   be either mandatory or optional.  An object is said to be mandatory
   in a PCEP message when the object must be included for the message to
   be considered valid.  For each PCEP message type, a set of rules is
   defined that specify the set of objects that the message can carry.
   An implementation MUST form the PCEP messages using the object
   ordering specified in this document.

   LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV MUST be included in the LSP object for PCECC LSP.

   The message formats in this document are specified using Routing
   Backus-Naur Form (RBNF) encoding as specified in [RFC5511].

6.1.  The PCInitiate Message

   The PCInitiate message [RFC8281] can be used to download or remove
   the labels, this document extends the message as shown below -


        <PCInitiate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                                 <PCE-initiated-lsp-list>
     Where:

                                <PCE-initiated-lsp-central-control>)

        <PCE-initiated-lsp-central-control> ::= <SRP>

        <cci-list> ::=  <CCI>
                        [<cci-list>]

     Where:
        <PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation> and
        <PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion> are as per
         [RFC8281].

        The LSP and SRP object is defined in [RFC8231].


   When PCInitiate message is used for the central controller
   instructions (labels), the SRP, LSP, and CCI objects MUST be present.
   The SRP object is defined in [RFC8231] and if the SRP object is
   missing, the receiving PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   type=6 (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value=10 (SRP object
   missing).  The LSP object is defined in [RFC8231] and if the LSP
   object is missing, the receiving PCC MUST send a PCErr message with
   Error-type=6 (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value=8 (LSP object
   missing).  The CCI object is defined in Section 7.3 and if the CCI
   object is missing, the receiving PCC MUST send a PCErr message with
   Error-type=6 (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value=TBD11 (CCI
   object missing).  More than one CCI object MAY be included in the
   PCInitiate message for a transit LSR.

   To clean up entries, the R (remove) bit MUST be set in the SRP object
   to be encoded along with the LSP and the CCI object.

   The CCI object received at the ingress node MUST have the O bit (out-
   label) set.  The CCI Object received at the egress MUST have the O
   bit unset.  If this is not the case, PCC MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = TBD5 ("PCECC failure") and Error Value = TBD9
   ("Invalid CCI").  Other instances of the CCI object if present, MUST
   be ignored.

   For the P2P LSP setup via PCECC technique, at the transit LSR two CCI
   objects are expected for in-coming and outgoing label associated with
   the LSP object.  If any other CCI object is included in the
   PCInitiate message, it MUST be ignored.  If the transit LSR did not
   receive two CCI object with one of them having the O bit set and
   another with O bit unset, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type = TBD5 ("PCECC failure") and Error Value = TBD9 ("Invalid CCI").

   Note that, on receipt of the PCInitiate message with CCI object, the
   ingress, egress, or transit role of the PCC is identified via the
   ingress and egress IP address encoded in the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV.

6.2.  The PCRpt Message

   The PCRpt message can be used to report the labels that were
   allocated by the PCE, to be used during the state synchronization
   phase or as an acknowledgment to PCInitiate message.

       Where:
         <path> is as per [RFC8231] and the LSP and SRP object are
         also defined in [RFC8231].

   When PCRpt message is used to report the central controller
   instructions (labels), the LSP and CCI objects MUST be present.  The
   LSP object is defined in [RFC8231] and if the LSP object is missing,
   the receiving PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=6
   (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value=8 (LSP object missing).
   The CCI object is defined in Section 7.3 and if the CCI object is
   missing, the receiving PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   type=6 (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value=TBD11 (CCI object
   missing).  Two CCI objects can be included in the PCRpt message for a
   transit LSR.

7.  PCEP Objects

   The PCEP objects defined in this document are compliant with the PCEP
   object format defined in [RFC5440].

7.1.  OPEN Object

   This document defines a new PST (TBD1) to be included in the PATH-
   SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN Object.  Further, a new sub-TLV
   for PCECC capability exchange is also defined.

7.1.1.  PCECC Capability sub-TLV

   The PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   Object in the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV, when the Path Setup
   Type list includes the PCECC Path Setup Type TBD1.  A PCECC-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV MUST be ignored if the PST list does not contain
   PST=TBD1.

   Its format is shown in Figure 7.

                    Figure 7: PCECC Capability sub-TLV

   The type of the TLV is TBD12 and it has a fixed length of 4 octets.

   The value comprises a single field - Flags (32 bits).  Currently, the
   following flag bit is defined:

   o  L bit (Label): if set to 1 by a PCEP speaker, the L flag indicates
      that the PCEP speaker support and is willing to handle the PCECC
      based central controller instructions for label download.  The bit
      MUST be set to 1 by both a PCC and a PCE for the PCECC label
      download/report on a PCEP session.

   o  Unassigned bits MUST be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be
      ignored on receipt.

7.2.  PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV

   The PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV is defined in [RFC8408]; this document
   defines a new PST value:

   o  PST = TBD1: Path is set up via PCECC mode.

   On a PCRpt/PCUpd/PCInitiate message, the PST=TBD1 in the PATH-SETUP-
   TYPE TLV in the SRP object MUST be included for a LSP set up via the
   PCECC-based mechanism.

   The Central Controller Instructions (CCI) Object is used by the PCE
   to specify the forwarding instructions (Label information in the
   context of this document) to the PCC, and MAY be carried within
   PCInitiate or PCRpt message for label download/report.

   CCI Object-Class is TBD13.

                           Figure 8: CCI Object

   The fields in the CCI object are as follows:

   CC-ID:  A PCEP-specific identifier for the CCI information.  A PCE
      creates a CC-ID for each instruction, the value is unique within
      the scope of the PCE and is constant for the lifetime of a PCEP
      session.  The values 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF are reserved and MUST NOT be
      used.  Note that [I-D.gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations] gives
      advice on assigning transient numeric identifiers such as the CC-
      ID so as to minimize security risks.

   Reserved1 (16 bit):  Set to zero while sending, ignored on receive.

   Flags (16 bit):  A field used to carry any additional information
      pertaining to the CCI.  Currently, the following flag bits are
      defined:

      *  O bit(Out-label) : If the bit is set to 1, it specifies the
         label is the OUT label and it is mandatory to encode the next-
         hop information (via Address TLVs Section 7.3.1 in the CCI

         object).  If the bit is not set, it specifies the label is the
         IN label and it is optional to encode the local interface
         information (via Address TLVs in the CCI object).

      *  C Bit (PCC Allocation): If the bit is set to 1, it indicates
         that the label allocation needs to be done by the PCC for this
         central controller instruction.  A PCE sets this bit to request
         the PCC to make an allocation from its label space.  A PCC
         would set this bit to indicate that it has allocated the label
         and report it to the PCE.

      *  All unassigned bits MUST be set to zero at transmission and
         ignored at receipt.

   Label (20-bit):  The Label information.

   Reserved2 (12 bit):  Set to zero while sending, ignored on receive.

7.3.1.  Address TLVs

   [RFC8779] defines IPV4-ADDRESS, IPV6-ADDRESS, and UNNUMBERED-ENDPOINT
   TLVs for the use of Generalized Endpoint.  The same TLVs can also be
   used in the CCI object to associate the next-hop information in the
   case of an outgoing label and local interface information in the case
   of an incoming label.  The next-hop information encoded in these TLVs
   needs to be a directly connected IP address/interface information.
   If the PCC is not able to resolve the next-hop information, it MUST
   reject the CCI and respond with a PCErr message with Error-Type =
   TBD5 ("PCECC failure") and Error Value = TBD15 ("Invalid next-hop
   information").

8.  Implementation Status

   [Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

9.  Security Considerations

   As per [RFC8283], the security considerations for a PCE-based
   controller is a little different from those for any other PCE system.
   That is, the operation relies heavily on the use and security of
   PCEP, so consideration should be given to the security features
   discussed in [RFC5440] and the additional mechanisms described in
   [RFC8253].  It further lists the vulnerability of a central
   controller architecture, such as a central point of failure, denial-
   of-service, and a focus for interception and modification of messages
   sent to individual NEs.

   In PCECC operations, the PCEP sessions are also required to the
   internal routers and thus increasing the resources required for the
   session management at the PCE.

   The PCECC extension builds on the existing PCEP messages and thus the
   security considerations described in [RFC5440], [RFC8231] and
   [RFC8281] continue to apply.  [RFC8253] specify the support of
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) in PCEP, as it provides support for
   peer authentication, message encryption, and integrity.  It further



Li, et al.              Expires September 5, 2021              [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2021


   provide mechanisms for associating peer identities with different
   levels of access and/or authoritativeness via an attribute in X.509
   certificates or a local policy with a specific accept-list of X.509
   certificate.  This can be used to check the authority for the PCECC
   operations.  Additional considerations are discussed in following
   sections.

9.1.  Malicious PCE

   In this extension, the PCE has complete control over the PCC to
   download/remove the labels and can cause the LSP's to behave
   inappropriately and cause a major impact to the network.  As a
   general precaution, it is RECOMMENDED that this PCEP extension be
   activated on mutually-authenticated and encrypted sessions across
   PCEs and PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority, using
   TLS [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best current practices
   in BCP 195 [RFC7525].

   Further, an attacker may flood the PCC with PCECC related messages at
   a rate that exceeds either the PCC's ability to process them or the
   network's ability to send them, by either spoofing messages or
   compromising the PCE itself.  [RFC8281] provides a mechanism to
   protect the PCC by imposing a limit.  The same can be used for the
   PCECC operations as well.

   As specified in Section 5.5.3.1, a PCC needs to check if the label in
   the CCI object is in the range set aside for the PCE, otherwise it
   MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=TBD5 (PCECC failure) and
   Error-value=TBD6 (Label out of range).

9.2.  Malicious PCC

   The PCECC mechanism described in this document requires the PCE to
   keep labels (CCI) that it downloads and relies on the PCC responding
   (with either an acknowledgment or an error message) to requests for
   LSP instantiation.  This is an additional attack surface by placing a
   requirement for the PCE to keep a CCI/label replica for each PCC.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that PCE implementations provide a limit on resources
   (in this case the CCI) a single PCC can occupy.  [RFC8231] provides a
   notification mechanism when such threshold is reached.

10.  Manageability Considerations

10.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCE or PCC implementation SHOULD allow the PCECC capability to be
   enabled/disabled as part of the global configuration.  Section 6.1 of
   [RFC8664] list various controlling factors regarding path setup type.

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2021


   They are also applicable to the PCECC path setup types.  Further,
   Section 6.2 of [RFC8664] describe the migration steps when path setup
   type of an existing LSP is changed.

10.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB, this MIB can be extended to get the
   PCECC capability status.

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] could be extended to
   enable/disable PCECC capability.

10.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

10.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   The operator needs the following information to verify that PCEP is
   operating correctly with respect to the PCECC path setup type.

   o  An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view whether the
      PCEP speaker sent the PCECC PST capability to its peer.

   o  An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view whether the
      peer sent the PCECC PST capability.

   o  An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view whether the
      PCECC PST is enabled on a PCEP session.

   o  If one PCEP speaker advertises the PCECC PST capability, but the
      other does not, then the implementation SHOULD create a log to
      inform the operator of the capability mismatch.

   o  If a PCEP speaker rejects a CCI, then it SHOULD create a log to
      inform the operator, giving the reason for the decision (local
      policy, Label issues, etc.).

10.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   PCEP extensions defined in this document do not put new requirements
   on other protocols.
