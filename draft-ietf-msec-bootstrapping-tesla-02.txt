Abstract

   TESLA, the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication
   protocol is a protocol for providing source authentication in
   multicast scenarios.  TESLA is an efficient protocol with low
   communication and computation overhead, which scales to large numbers
   of receivers, and also tolerates packet loss.  TESLA is based on
   loose time synchronization between the sender and the receivers.
   Source authentication is realized in TESLA by using MAC chaining.
   The use of TESLA within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol

   (SRTP) has been published targeting multicast authentication in
   scenarios, where SRTP is applied to protect the multimedia data.
   This solution assumes that TESLA parameters are made available by
   out-of-band mechanisms.

   This document specifies MIKEY payloads for bootstrapping TESLA for
   source authentication of secure group communications using SRTP.
   TESLA may be bootstrapped using one of the MIKEY key management
   approaches, e.g., by using a digitally signed MIKEY message sent via
   unicast, multicast or broadcast.

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


1.  Introduction

   In many multicast, broadcast, and also unicast communication
   scenarios it is necessary to guarantee that a recieved message has
   been sent from a dedicated source and has not been altered while in
   transfer.  In unicast communication commonly a pairwise security
   association exists, which enables the validation of message integrity
   and data origin.  The approach in group based communication is
   different as here a key is normally shared between the members of a
   group and thus this key may not be used for data origin
   authentication.  As in some applications a dedicated identification
   of a sender is required, there exists the requirement to support data
   origin authentication also in multicast scenarios.  One of the
   methods supporting this is TESLA [RFC4082].  TESLA provides source
   authentication in multicast scenarios by using MAC chaining.  It is
   based on loose time synchronization between the sender and the
   receivers.

   [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] describes extensions for SRTP [RFC3711] in
   order to support TESLA [RFC4082] for source authentication in
   multicast scenarios.  SRTP needs dedicated cryptographic context
   describing the security paramter and security policy per multimedia
   session to be protected.  This cryptographic context needs to be
   enhanced with a set of TESLA parameters.  It is necessary to provide
   these parameters before the actual multicast session starts.
   [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] does not address the bootstrapping for
   these parameters.

   This document details bootstrapping of TESLA parameters in terms of
   parameter distribution for TESLA policy as well as the initial key,
   using the Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) [RFC3830] protocol.
   MIKEY defines an authentication and key management framework that can
   be used for real-time applications (both for peer-to-peer
   communication and group communication).  In particular, [RFC3830] is
   defined in a way to support SRTP in the first place but is open to
   enhancements to be used for other purposes too.  Following the
   description in RFC 3830 [RFC3830] MIKEY is targeted for point-to-
   point as well as for group communication.  In the context of group
   communication an administrator entity can distribute session keys to
   the associated entities participating in the communication session.
   This scenario is also applicable for TESLA where one entity may
   provide information to many others in a way that the integrity of the
   communicated information can be assured.  The combination of MIKEY
   and TESLA supports this group-based approach by utilizing the MIKEY
   framework to distribute TESLA parameter information to all involved
   entities.  Note that this document does only focus on the
   distribution of the parameters, not on the generation.

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


   MIKEY [RFC3830] itself describes three authentication and key
   exchange protocols (symmetric key enryption, public key encryption,
   and signed Diffie Hellman) Extensions to the MIKEY key exchange
   methods have been defined.  A fourth key distribution method is
   provided by [I-D.ietf-msec-mikey-dhhmac] and describes a symetrically
   protected Diffie Hellman key agreement.  Recently a further option
   has been proposed in [I-D.ietf-msec-mikey-rsa-r] describing an
   enhanced asymmetric exchange variant, supporting also inband
   certificate exchange.  All of the different key management schemens
   mentioned above may be used to provide the TESLA parameters.  The
   required TESLA parameters to be exchanged are already described in
   [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla], while this document describes their
   transport within MIKEY.

   The following security requirements have to be placed on the exchange
   of TESLA parameters:
   o  Authentication and Integrity MUST be provided when sending the
      TESLA parameters, especially for the initial key.
   o  Confidentiality MAY be provided for the TESLA parameters
   These security requirements apply to the TESLA bootstrapping
   procedure only.  Security requirements for applications using TESLA
   are beyond the scope of this document.  Security aspects that relate
   to TESLA itself are described in [RFC4082] and security issues for
   TESLA usage for SRTP is covered in [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla].

   It is important to note that this document is one piece of a complete
   solution.  Assuming that media traffic is to be secured using TESLA
   as described in [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] then (a) keying material
   is required and (b) parameters for TESLA.  This document contributes
   the parameters and the authentication methods used in MIKEY to
   provide the keying material.  The parameter exchange for TESLA also
   needs to be secured against tampering.  This protection is provided
   also by MIKEY.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  TESLA Parameter Overview

   According to [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] the following transform
   dependent parameters need to be provided for proper TESLA operation
   (the information in brackets provides the default values specified in
   section 6.2 of [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla]:

   1.   An identifier for the PRF, implementing the one-way function
        F(x) in TESLA (F(x) is used to calculate keys using a hash
        chain), e.g. to indicate a keyed hashing function (dafault HMAC-
        SHA1).

   2.   A non-negative integer, determining the length of the F output,
        i.e. the length of the keys in the chain (that is also the key
        disclosed in an SRTP packet if TESLA is used in the SRTP
        context) (dafault 160 bit).

   3.   An identifier for the PRF, implementing the one-way function
        F'(x) in TESLA (to derive the keys for the TESLA MAC, from the
        keys in the chain), e.g. to indicate a keyed hashing function
        (default HMAC-SHA1).

   4.   A non-negative integer, determining the length of the output of
        F', i.e. the length of the key for the TESLA MAC (default 160
        bit).

   5.   An identifier for the TESLA MAC, that accepts the output of
        F'(x) as its key, e.g. to indicate a keyed hashing function
        (default HMAC-SHA1).

   6.   A non-negative integer, determining the length of the output of
        the TESLA MAC (default 80 bit).

   7.   The beginning of the session for which a key will be applied.

   8.   The interval duration (in milliseconds), for which a dedicated
        key will be used.

   9.   The key disclosure delay (in number of intervals), characterizes
        the period after which the key will be sent to the involved
        entities (e.g., as part of SRTP packets).

   10.  Non-negative integer, determining the length of the key chain,
        which is determined based up the expected duration of the
        stream.

   11.  The initial key of the chain to which the sender has committed
        himself.

   Section 6.2 in [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] provides more information
   about the default value for the above-listed parameters.


4.  Parameter encoding within MIKEY

   As mentioned in Section 3, TESLA parameters need to be transported
   before actually starting a session.  MIKEY currently only defines a
   payload for transporting the SRTP policy (see Section 6.10 of
   [RFC3830]).  This section describes the enhancement of MIKEY to allow
   the transport of a TESLA policy and additionally the initial TESLA
   key.

4.1.  Security Policy payload (SP)

   The Security Policy payload defines a set of policies that apply to a
   specific security protocol.  The definition here relies on the
   security policy payload definition in [RFC3830].


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   ! Next payload  ! Policy no     ! Prot type     ! Policy param  ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   ~ length (cont) ! Policy param                                  ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


      *  Next payload (8 bits):
         Identifies the payload that is added after
         this payload. See Section 6.1 of [RFC3830] for
         more details.


      *  Policy no (8 bits):
         Each security policy payload must be given a
         distinct number for the current MIKEY session by the
         local peer. This number is used to map a cryptographic session
         to a specific policy (see also Section 6.1.1 of [RFC3830]).


      *  Prot type (8 bits):
         This value defines the security protocol.
         A second value needs to be defined as shown below:
         (MIKEY already defines the value 0.)

         Prot type     | Value |
         ---------------------------
         SRTP          |     0 |
         TESLA         |     1 |

      *  Policy param length (16 bits):
         This field defines the total length of the
         policy parameters for the selected security protocol.


      *  Policy param (variable length):
         This field defines the policy for the specific
         security protocol.

   The Policy param part is built up by a set of Type/Length/Value (TLV)
   payloads.  For each security protocol, a set of possible type/value
   pairs can be negotiated as defined.


    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      *  Type (8 bits):
         Specifies the type of the parameter.

      *  Length (8 bits):
         Specifies the length of the Value field (in bytes).

      *  Value (variable length):
         Specifies the value of the parameter.

4.2.  TESLA policy

   This policy specifies the parameters for TESLA.  The types/values
   that can be negotiated are defined by the following table.  The
   concrete default values are taken from [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla],
   but other values may also be used:

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


      Type | Meaning                                | Possible values
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
         1 | PRF identifier for f, realising F(x)   | see below
         2 | Length of PRF f output                 | 160
         3 | PRF identifier for f', realising F'(x) | see below
         4 | Length of PRF f' output                | 160
         5 | Identifier for the TESLA MAC           | see below
         6 | Length of TESLA MAC output             | 80 (truncated)
         7 | Start of session                       | in bytes
         8 | Interval duration (in msec)            | in bytes
         9 | Key disclosure delay                   | in bytes
         10| Key chain length (numer of intervals)  | in bytes
         11| local timestamp media receiver         | see below


      For the PRF realising F(x), a one byte length is sufficient.
      The currently defined possible values are:

        TESLA PRF F(x)  | Value
        -----------------------
        HMAC-SHA1       |  0


      For the PRF realising F'(x), a one byte length is enough.
      The currently defined possible values are:

        TESLA PRF F'(x) | Value
        -----------------------
        HMAC-SHA1       |  0


      For the TESLA MAC, a one byte length is enough.
      The currently defined possible values are:

        TESLA MAC       | Value
        -----------------------
        HMAC-SHA1       |  0

4.3.  Time synchronization

   MIKEY as well as TESLA require the time synchronization of the
   communicating peers.  MIKEY requires time sychronization to provide
   timestamp-based replay protection for the one-roundtrip
   authentication and key exchange protocols.  TESLA, on the other hand,
   needs this information to determine the clock drift between the
   senders and the receivers in order to appropriately release the
   disclosed key.  Two alternatives are available for time
   synchronization:

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


   1.  Usage of out-of-band synchronization using NTP [RFC1305].  This
       approach is already recommended within [RFC3830].  The advantage
       of this approach is the option to use the MIKEY key management
       variants that perform within a half-roundtrip.  The disadvantage
       is the required time synchronization via an additional protocol.
   2.  [RFC4082] also sketches a possible inband synchronization in
       Section 3.3.1.  This approach is shortly repeated here in the
       context of MIKEY.  Note, that here the actual TESLA policy
       payload is transmitted as part of the MIKEY responder message.
       *  The data receiver, which would be the MIKEY initiator sets the
          local time parameter t_r and sends it as part of the timestamp
          payload as described in [RFC3830].  This value t_r needs to be
          stored locally.
       *  Upon receipt of the MIKEY initiator message the data sender
          replies with the MIKEY responder message, setting the local
          time stamp at data receiver (parameter 11) to the value t_r
          received in the MIKEY initiator message and sets his local
          time as 64 bit UTC value t_s in the timestamp payload as
          described in [RFC3830].

           MIKEY initiator message
           [MIKEY parameter incl. local timestamp (t_r)]
           ------------------>

           MIKEY responder message
           [MIKEY parameter incl. local timestamp (t_s), TESLA policy
            payload, received local time stamp t_r]
           <------------------

       *  Upon receiving the MIKEY responder message the data receiver
          sets D_t = t_s - t_r + S, where S is an estimated bound on the
          clock drift throughout the duration of the session.
       This approach has the advantage that it does not require an
       additional time synchronization protocol.  The disadvantage is
       the necessity to perform a full MIKEY handshake, to enable
       correct parameter transport.  Moreover this approach is direction
       dependent, as it may only be applied if the media receiver is
       also the MIKEY initiator.

       Therefore, in scenarios, where the media receiver is also the
       MIKEY initiator, alternative 2, piggybacking timestamp
       information in MIKEY, MAY be chosen, while in any other case NTP
       SHOULD be used (alternative 1).

4.4.  Key data transport within MIKEY's General Extension Payload

   The General Extensions Payload was defined to allow possible
   extensions to MIKEY without the need for defining a completely new

5.  Security Considerations

   The security properties of multi-media data in a multicast
   environment depends on a number of building blocks.

   SRTP-TESLA [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] describes extensions for SRTP
   [RFC3711] in order to support TESLA [RFC4082] for source
   authentication in multicast scenarios.  As such, security
   considerations described with TESLA (see [PCST] and [RFC4082]), the
   TESLA SRTP mapping [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] and SRTP [RFC3711]
   itself are relevant in this context.

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


   Furthermore, since this document details bootstrapping of TESLA using
   the Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) [RFC3830] protocol the
   security considerations of MIKEY are applicable to this document.

   As a summary, in order for a multi-media application to support TESLA
   the following protocol interactions (in relationship to this document
   are necessary):
   o  MIKEY [RFC3830] is executed between the desired entities to
      perform authentication and a secure distribution of keying
      material.  In order to subsequently use TESLA the parameters
      described in this document are distributed using MIKEY.  MIKEY
      itself uses another protocol for parameter transport, namely SDP,
      that might again be used within SIP to setup a session between the
      desired entities.
   o  After the algorithms, parameters and the session keys are
      available at the respective communication entities data traffic
      protection via SRTP-TESLA [I-D.ietf-msec-srtp-tesla] can be used.
      SRTP-TESLA itself applies TESLA to the SRTP protocol and as such
      the processing guidelines of TESLA need to be followed.

5.1.  MitM Attack

   Threat:

      The exchange of security related parameters and algorithms without
      proper authentication can allow an adversary to perform a man-in-
      the-middle attack.  The mechanisms described in this document do
      not itself provide such an authentication and integrity
      protection.

   Countermeasures:

      Throughout the document it is assumed that the parameter exchange
      is secured using another protocol, i.e., the exchange parameters
      and algorithms are part of a authentication and key exchange
      protocol, namely MIKEY.  Source authentication of group and
      multicast communication cannot be provided for the data traffic if
      the prior signaling exchange did not provide facilities to
      authenticate the source.  Using an authentication protocol that
      does not provide session keys as part of a successful protocol run
      it is not possible to derive the necessary parameters required by
      TESLA.  MIKEY provides session key establishment.  Additionally,
      the exchange of parameters and algorithms MUST be authenticated
      and integrity protected.  The security protection of the parameter
      exchange needs to provide the same level or a higher level of
      security.

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


5.2.  Downgrading Attack

   Threat:

      The exchange of security-related parameters and algorithms is
      always subject to downgrading whereby an adversary modifies some
      (or all) of the provided parameters.  For example, a few
      parameters require that a supported hash algorithm is listed.  To
      mount an attack the adversary has to modify the list of provided
      algorithms and to select the weakest one.

   Countermeasures:

      The parameter exchange provided in this document MUST be integrity
      protected to prevent modification of fields and their values.
      Moreover, since unmodified parameters from an unknown source are
      not useful, authentication MUST be provided.  This functionality
      is not provided by mechanisms described in this document.  Instead
      the capabilities of the underlying authentication and key exchange
      protocol (MIKEY) are reused for this purpose.

5.3.  Denial of Service Attack

   Threat:

      An adversary might want to modify parameters exchange between the
      communicating entities in order to establish different state
      information at the respective communication entities.  For
      example, an adversary might want to modify the key disclosure
      delay or the interval duration in order to discurpt the
      communication at a later state since the TESLA algorithm assumes
      that the participating communication entities know the same
      parameter set.

   Countermeasures:

      The exchanged parameters and the parameters and algorithms MUST be
      integrity protected to allow the recipient to detect whether an
      adversary attempted to modify the exchanged information.
      Authentication and key exchange algorithms provided by MIKEY offer
      this protection.

5.4.  Replay Attack

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


   Threat:

      An adversary who is able to eavesdrop one or multiple protocol
      exchanges (MIKEY exchanges with the parameters described in this
      document) might be able to replay the payloads in a later protocol
      exchange.  If the recipients accept the parameters and algorithms
      (or even the messages that carry these payloads as well then a
      Denial of Service, downgrading or a man-in-the-middle attack might
      be the consequence (depending on the entire set of replayed
      attributes and messages).

   Countermeasures:

      In order to prevent replay attacks a freshness guarantee MUST be
      provided.  As such, the TESLA bootstrapping message exchange MUST
      be unique and fresh and the corresponding authentication and key
      exchange protocol MUST provide the same properties.  In fact, it
      is essential to derive a unique and fresh session key as part of
      the authentication and key exchange protocol run that MUST be
      bound to the protocol session.  This includes the exchanged
      parameters.

5.5.  Traffic Analysis

   Threat:

      An adversary might be able to learn parameters and algorithms, if
      located along the signaling path.  This information can then later
      be used to mount attacks against the end-to-end multi-media
      communication.  In some high-security and military environments it
      might even be desireable not to reveal information about the used
      parameters to make it more difficult to launch an attack.

   Countermeasures:

      Confidentity protection can be provided by a subset of the
      available MIKEY authentication and key exchange protocols, namely
      those providing public key encryption and symmetric key
      encryption.  The initial hash key, which is also one of the TESLA
      bootstrapping parameters, does not require confidentiality
      protection due to the properties of a hash chain.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires an IANA registration for the following
   attributes:

Internet-Draft             Bootstrapping TESLA              October 2005


   Prot Type:

      This attribute specifies the protocol type for the security
      protocol as described in Section 4.1.

   Pseudo-random Function (PRF) used in the TESLA policy:

      This attribute specifies values for pseudo-random functions used
      in the the TESLA policy (see Section 4.2).

   MAC Function used in TESLA:

      This attribute specifies values for pseudo-random functions used
      in the the TESLA policy (see Section 4.2).

   Type:

      Identifies the type of the general payload.  The General
      Extensions Payload was defined to allow possible extensions to
      MIKEY without the need for defining a completely new payload each
      time.  Section 4.4 describes this attribute in more detail.


   Following the policies outline in [RFC2434] the values in the range
   up to 240 (including 240) for the above attributes are assigned after
   Expert Review by the MSEC working group or its designated successor.
   The values in the range from 241 to 255 are reserved for Private Use.

   IANA needs to register the following attributes and their respective
   values:

   Prot Type:


         Prot Type     | Value | Description
         -----------------------------------------------------
         TESLA         |     1 | TESLA as a security protocol
