1.  Introduction

   RFC 4291 [RFC4291] defines "scop is a 4-bit multicast scope value
   used to limit the scope of the multicast group." scop 3 is defined as
   "reserved" in RFC 4291.  The multicast protocol specification in
   draft-ietf-roll-trickle-mcast [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast] desires
   to use multicast scop 3 for transport of multicast traffic scoped to
   a network of nodes connected in a mesh.  The use of this scop value
   is to accommodate a multicast scope that is greater than Link-Local
   but is also automatically determined by the network architecture.

2.  Definition of IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes (Updates RFC 4291)

   The following table updates the definitions in RFC 4291:

   OLD:

         Admin-Local scope is the smallest scope that must be
         administratively configured, i.e., not automatically derived
         from physical connectivity or other, non-multicast-related
         configuration.

   NEW:

         Interface-Local, Link-Local, and Realm-Local scope
         boundaries are automatically derived from physical
         connectivity or other, non-multicast related configuration.
         Global scope has no boundary.  The boundaries of all other
         non-reserved scopes of Admin-Local or larger are
         administratively configured.  For reserved scopes, the way
         of configuring their boundaries will be defined when the
         semantics of the scope is defined.

         According to RFC 4007 [RFC4007], the zone of a Realm-Local
         scope must fall within zones of larger scope.  Because the
         zone of a Realm-Local scope is configured automatically,
         while the zones of larger scopes are configured manually,
         care must be taken in the definition of those larger scopes
         to ensure that inclusion constraint is met.

         Realm-Local scopes created by different network technologies
         are considered to be independent and will have different zone
         indices (see RFC 4007, section 6).  A router with interfaces
         on links using different network technologies does not forward
         traffic between the Realm-Local multicast scopes defined by
         those technologies.




3.  Definition of Realm-Local scopes

   The definition of any Realm-Local scope for a particular network
   technology should be published in an RFC.  For example, such a scope
   definition would be appropriate for publication in an "IPv6-over-foo"
   RFC.

   Any RFCs that include the definition of a Realm-Local scope will be
   added to the IANA 'IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes' registry under the
   Realm-Local scope entry, and those specifications must include such a
   request in their IANA Considerations.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes            June 2014


   Section 5 of this document gives the definition of scop 3 for IEEE
   802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] networks.

4.  Definition of automatic and administratively configured scopes
    (updates RFC 4007)

   Section 5 of RFC 4007 [RFC4007] and section 2.7 of RFC 4291 disagree
   about the way in which multicast scope 3 is configured.  To resolve
   that disagreement, change the last bullet in the list in section 5 of
   RFC 4007 as follows:



   OLD:

     o  The boundaries of zones of a scope other than interface-local,
        link-local, and global must be defined and configured by network
        administrators.

   NEW:

     o  The boundaries of zones of a scope are defined by the IPv6
        addressing architecture [RFC4291] and updated by [RFC-to-be].


5.  Definition of Realm-Local Scope for IEEE 802.15.4

   When used in an IP-over-IEEE802.15.4 network, "scop 3" is defined to
   include all interfaces sharing a PAN ID.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish a sub-registry titled "IPv6 Multicast
   Address Scopes" in the existing "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
   Multicast Address Allocations" registry.  The new registry is to be
   populated with the scope values given in Section 2.  New definitions
   for scop values will be made with "IETF Review" policy.

   IANA is requested to add a reference to the Realm-Local scope entry
   (scop 3) in the "IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes" registry for each
   future RFC that defines a Realm-Local scope for new network
   technologies.  Such RFCs are expected to make an explicit request to
   IANA for inclusion in the registry.

   IANA is requested to include a note to the top of the "IPv6 Multicast
   Address Scopes" registry:

        The definition of any Realm-Local scope for a particular network
        technology should be published in an RFC.  For example, such a
        scope definition would be appropriate for publication in an
        'IPv6-over-foo' RFC.

        Any RFCs that define a Realm-Local scope will be listed in this
        registry as an additional reference in the Realm-Local scope
        entry.  Such RFCs are expected to make an explicit request to
        IANA for inclusion in this registry.
