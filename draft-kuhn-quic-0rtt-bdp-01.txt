   This memo discusses a solution where a fundamental characteristic of
   the path is learned during the 1-RTT phase and shared with the 0-RTT
   phase to accelerate the initial throughput during subsequent 0-RTT
   connections.

1.  Introduction

   0-RTT is designed to accelerate the throughput at the establishment
   of a connection.  There are cases where 0-RTT alone does not improve
   the time-to-service.

   As shown in [IJSCN19], the usage of a congestion control and
   transport initialization not adapted to satellite communication
   results in higher page loading time for heavy pages in a SATCOM
   context.  QUIC's congestion control is based on TCP NewReno
   [I-D.ietf-quic-recovery] and the recommended initial window is
   defined by [RFC6928].  This may not be suitable for good quality of
   experience for users in high Bandwidth Delay-Product (BDP) networks.

   This memo discusses a solution where a fundamental characteristic of
   the path is learned during the 1-RTT phase and shared with the 0-RTT
   phase to accelerate the initial throughput during subsequent 0-RTT
   connections.

2.  QUIC connection establishment

   This section recalls how 1-RTT and 0-RTT work.

   QUIC leverages the 2 handshakes of TLS1.3 [I-D.ietf-quic-tls].  The
   1-RTT handshake initiates a first set of credentials.  When a
   handshake achieves successfully, the server pushes information
   learned about the session to the client in an opaque session ticket
   (see section 4.6.1 of [RFC8446]).  The pieces of information of the
   ticket are meaningless to the client.  A client willing to establish
   a fast re-opening of the session pushes back this opaque 'ticket' in
   a 0-RTT handshake and sends early application data.

   In practice, the server sends the 'ticket' in a NewSessionTicket
   record [I-D.ietf-quic-tls].  The structure of the NewSessionTicket
   includes the opaque 'ticket' and an 'extensions' field.  The
   NewSessionTicket carries an additional field named 'early_data' which
   indicates to the client the maximal size of application data to
   insert in the 0-RTT message.

3.  Large BDP connections

   GEO-satellite based systems characteristics differ from terrestrial
   networks with:

   o  A large propagation delay of at least 250ms one-way delay;

   o  A high bit-rate in case of mobile users or when a user connects
      behind a box using Wi-Fi;

   o  Highly asymmetric links.

   These characteristics have an impact on end-to-end congestion
   controls:

   o  Transport initialization: the 3-way handshake takes a long time
      reducing the time at which actual data can be transmitted;

   o  Maximum windows sizing: to fully exploit the bottleneck capacity,
      the high BDP may induce an important number of in-flights packets;

   o  Reliability: packet losses detection and correction is slow and
      the time needed for the end server to react to a congestion event
      may not be relevant;

   o  Getting up to speed: the exponential increase of the data rate
      transmission for a channel capacity probing is slowed down when
      the RTT is high.

4.  TCP split solution

   High BDP networks commonly break the TCP end-to-end paradigm to adapt
   the transport protocol.  Splitting TCP allows adaptations to this
   specific use-case and assessing the issues discussed in section
   Section 3.  PEP [RFC3135] are commonly deployed in SATCOM
   infrastructure for that purpose and their deployment can result in
   50% page load time reduction in a SATCOM use-case [ICCRG100].

   [NCT13] and [RFC3135] describe the main functionalities of SATCOM TCP
   split solutions.  Shortly, for traffic going from a gateway to an end
   user behind a terminal, the TCP split intercepts TCP SYN to act as
   the end user and adapt the data rate transmission to the SATCOM
   scenario.  The TCP split specifically tune the TCP parameters to the
   context (latency, available capacity) that is measured.

   One important advantage of a TCP split solution is that it does not
   require any end-to-end modifications and is independent for both
   client and server sides.  That being said, this comes with a
   drawback: TCP splitters can hardly embed the most recent end-to-end
   improvements (e.g.  ECN or TCP Fast Open support).

5.  End-to-end solution

   This section proposes an improvement of the initialization of 0-RTT
   connections over satellite communication where the client recalls the
   BDP previously measured by the server during the 1-RTT handshake.
   The approach follows the tuning of the initial window described in
   [I-D.irtf-iccrg-sallantin-initial-spreading] which has been shown to
   improve performance both for high BDP and more common BDP
   [CONEXT15][ICC16].

5.1.  Description of the extension in the NewSessionTicket

   A new extension named "BDP_data" is defined for NewSessionTicket.  It
   contains the following value: BDP_value, that is the value in bits
   (same unit as [RFC6349]).  The reception of the field BDP_data
   provides the client with 3 indications:

   o  The path with this server has a large BDP;

   o  The server added the path characteristics in the opaque 'ticket'
      field;

   o  The server will optimize the reopening of the session upon
      reception of this opaque ticket.

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT                March 2019


5.2.  Usage of the extension in the NewSessionTicket

   A server measures a connection BDP far larger than usual.  It
   includes the path characteristics in the opaque ticket it sends to
   the client in a NewSessionTicket message.  The message includes an
   additional 'extensions' field named 'BDP_data'.  The client stores
   the session ticket and the 'BDP_data' field.

   When the client reconnects to this server in 0-RTT mode, it pushes
   back this session ticket in the ClientHello and prepares itself to
   receive data in the context given by the 'BDP_data' field (The client
   does not send the 'BDP_data' field back to the server).  The server
   receives the session ticket and extracts the BDP context.  It uses
   this information to provide a throughput closer to the capacity of
   the path.

   As the validity of the path characteristics may change over the time
   the server sets the age of the ticket (see section 4.2.11.1 of
   [RFC8446]) to a short duration or updates the ticket when the path
   characteristics of the current connection changes.

6.  Best current practice

   This section provides examples of data that could be added in the
   opaque ticket field by the server.  The details added by the server
   in the session ticket do not need to be standardized for
   interoperability between QUIC clients and servers because it is
   opaque to the client.  The presence of the "BDP_data" extension field
   in the NewSessionTicket informs the client that the server will
   actively take action to improve its throughput when the session will
   restart.

   Here are examples of information elements set by the server in the
   session ticket to accompany the signaling of field.  These examples
   are illustrated in Figure 1 and their purpose is detailed in this
   section.

   o  client aware of the high BDP: The section 7.3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] indicates that the "A client that
      attempts to send 0-RTT data MUST remember the transport parameters
      used by the server".  On top of other transport parameters used by
      the server, knowing that the BDP is high let the client adapt
      parameters specifically.  As example, the client could adapt the
      ACK ratio following the discussion in Issue 1978 of the GITHUB
      repository.

   o  PMTU: The knowledge of the MTU of the previous path improves the
      time to service because it reduces the duration of the path

      validation process described in section 8.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   o  connection RTT: The knowledge of the characteristics of the
      previous connection RTT improves the throughput because the server
      can safely improve the slow start: e.g. using pacing models of
      [I-D.irtf-iccrg-sallantin-initial-spreading] can result in high IW
      for high RTT paths and a common IW for paths with smaller RTT.
      The results presented in [ICC16] show that for both files of 15 kB
      and 750 kB, the proposed solution reduces the time to download by
      approximatively 2 seconds whether the RTT is 50ms or 500ms.

   o  ticket_lifetime: The server sets a shorter validity duration to
      avoid receiving obsolete path characteristics later; as an example
      it reduces the validity to one day.

7.  Discussion

   The proposal made in this draft follows the approach of the extension
   field 'early_data' of the NewSessionTicket of TLS1.3.  While
   'early_data' improves the egress traffic of a client, the 'BDP_data'
   proposal aims at improving its ingress traffic.  Improving the
   ingress traffic of an end user can result in drastic quality-of-
   experience improvements.  As example, this contribution enables the
   exploitation of the RTT, PMTU and BDP to adapt the initial data
   transmission of a 0-RTT connection to halve the page load time of a
   web page download.

10.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: text is required to register the extension BDP_data field.

11.  Security Considerations

   The security is provided by the 1-RTT phase.  The measure of BDP is
   made during a previous connection.  The exchange and the information
   are protected both by the TLS encryption and the NewSessionTicket
   (see section 4.6.1 of [RFC8446]).

   The BDP information the server will received is protected in the
   opaque session ticket.  The 'BDP_data' field is visible by the client
   only.  An client which does not trust the server transport adaptation
   ignores any session ticket associated to a 'BDP_data' field.
