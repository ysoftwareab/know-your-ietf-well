                   Game State over Real Time Protocol
             draft-jennings-dispatch-game-state-over-rtp-00

Abstract

   This specification defines an Real Time Protocol (RTP) payload to
   send game moves and the state of game objects over RTP.  This is
   useful for games as well collaboration systems that use augment or
   virtual reality.

   RTP provide a way to synchronize game state between players with
   robust technique for recovery from network packet loss while still
   having low latency.

Internet-Draft             Game State over RTP                March 2022


1.  Overview

   Many real time applications, such as games, want to to share state
   about 3D objects across the network.  This specification allows an
   application to define objects with state, and the current values of
   that state over RTP.

   The conceptual model is each RTP sender has a small number of objects
   with state that needs to be synchronized to the other side.  The
   current values are periodically sent over RTP.  They MAY be sent when
   the values change, but they MUST also be sent periodically so that
   any lost updates are eventually received and state is consistent
   between the sender and receiver.

   The state sent can include a time stamp and rate change estimates
   that allow the receiver to estimate the current state values even at
   a point in the future.  An application that receives a state update
   can apply it immediately (often called immediate based), wait a fixed
   delay and then apply state changes (often called delay based), or
   apply a predicted value based on overwriting any previous predictions
   (often called rollback based).

   In many cases the state does not have any units but if does, SI units
   SHOULD be used.  Unless otherwise defined by the application, the
   default coordinate system SHOULD be a left handed coordinate system
   where Y points up and X points to the right.

   Applications can define their own objects or use some of the
   predefined common objects.  Each object is identified by a type and
   identifier number to uniquely identify the object within the scope of
   that sender's RTP stream.  Multiple updates and objects can be
   combined in a single RTP packet so that they are guaranteed to be
   fate shared and either atomically delivered at the same time or not
   delivered at all to the receiver.

   The objects are defined as a series of primitives that define common
   types.  The objects and updates to state are encoded with Tag Length
   Value (TLV) style encoding so that receivers can skip objects they do
   not understand.  The Objects in an single RTP packet MUST be
   processed in order.  This allows a sender to write state in an old
   format followed by a new format, allowing the new format to override
   values in the old format.  This allows for easy upgrade of the
   protocol with backwards compatibility.

2.  Goals:

   *  Support 2D and 3D
   *  Support delay and rollback based synchronization

   *  Relatively compact, simple encoding
   *  Extensible for applications to send custom data
   *  Support for forward and backwards compatibility

3.  Primitives

   This section defines primitives that are useful in defining objects.
   The definition are in W3C style EBNF [https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-
   xquery-20101214/#EBNFNotation (https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xquery-
   20101214/#EBNFNotation)].

3.1.  Location

   Loc1 ::=
    Float32 /* x */
    Float32 /* y */
    Float32 /* z */

   Loc1 is simply a 3D location of a point stored in Float32;

   Loc2 ::=
    Float32 /* x */
    Float32 /* y */
    Float32 /* z */
    Float16 /* vx */
    Float16 /* vy */
    Float16 /* vz */

   Loc2 has a location as Float32 followed by the rate of change in
   location per second as Float16.

3.2.  Scale

   Scale1 ::=
   Float16 /* all dimensions */

   Scale1 will scale the object in all dimensions equally.

   Scale2 ::=
    Float32 /* x */
    Float32 /* y */
    Float32 /* z */
    Float16 /* vx */
    Float16 /* vy */
    Float16 /* vz */

   Scale2 has a scale in each axis as Float32 followed by the rate of
   change in the scale per second as Float16.

3.3.  Normal

   Norm1 ::=
    Float16 /* nx */
    Float16 /* ny */
    Float16 /* nz */

   Normal vector for a point.

3.4.  TextureUV

   TextureUV1 ::=
    VarUInt /* u */
    VarUInt /* v */

   Location in texture map for a point.

3.5.  Rotation

   Rot1 ::=
    Float16 /* i */
    Float16 /* j */
    Float16 /* k */

   The non-real parts of a normalized rotation quaternion.  The real
   part can be computed based on how it is normalized.

   Rot2 ::=
    Float16 /* s.i */
    Float16 /* s.j */
    Float16 /* s.k */
    Float16 /* e.i */
    Float16 /* e.j */
    Float16 /* e.k */

   Rot2 defines the s, the current rotation, and e, an estimated value
   of the rotation in one second.  The rotation e is chosen such that
   rotation of the object will follow a rotation along the great circle
   path from s to e with an constant angular rotation rate such that it
   would reach e in 1 second.

   This representation of rate of change of the rotation allows the
   receiver to use an algorithm such as SLERP
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   Slerp)] to estimate the current rotation for the object for short
   periods of time into the future.  The representation cannot represent
   something that is rotating faster than one revolution ever 2 seconds.

   Open Issue: Would there be a better way to represent angular
   velocity?

3.6.  Child Transform

   Transform1 ::=
    Float16 /* tx */
    Float16 /* ty */
    Float16 /* tz */

   Defines a linear translation of a child object from a base object.

3.7.  Texture URL

   TextureUrl1 ::= String

   URL of image with texture map.  JPEG images SHOULD be supported.

3.8.  Mesh URL

   MeshUrl1 ::= String

   URL of external mesh.

   Open Issue: Any mandatory to implements mesh formats?

3.9.  Texture Stream

   In some cases it is desirable to provide a separate RTP video stream
   which might have the texture used be the frame from the video stream
   with the corresponding time to the game object that uses the texture
   map.  To do this there needs to be a way to identity the other RTP
   video stream.  One way to do that is use the "Payload Type" value
   used for the RTP packets for that video stream.

   TextureRtpPT1 ::= UInt8 /* pt */

   RTP "Payload Type" value of RTP video stream to use as a texture map.

   Open Issue: Is there a better way to identity video stream?

3.10.  Timestamp

   Time1 ::= UInt16 /* time in ms */

   Lower 16 bits of number in milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1
   January 1970, not counting leap seconds.  The assumption is these
   timestamps are accurate to about the level of an NTP synchronized
   clock.  In C++20 this can be found with:

   duration_cast<milliseconds>(
         system_clock::now().time_since_epoch()
       ).count() % 65536

4.  Objects

   All objects must start with a unique tag that defines the object
   type, a VarUInt length, a VarUInt objectID, and the data for object.
   Applications can reserve tags for objects in the registry defined in
   the IANA section.  Objects can be made extensible by adding a section
   that contains optional tag, length, value tuples.

4.1.  Common Objects

4.1.1.  Generic Game Object

   It is common to need to describe the location, rotation, scale, and
   parent for objects in a scene.

   Object1 ::= tagObject1 Length ObjectID Time1
    Loc1
    Rot1
    Scale1
     ( tagParent1 Length ObjectID )? /* Optional Parent */

   Object1 contains a simple 3D location, rotation, scale and an
   optional ID of a parent object.

   Object2 ::= tagObject2 Length ObjectID Time1
    Loc2
    Rot2
    Scale2
    ( tagParent1 Length ObjectID )? /* Optional Parent */

   Object2 has the same information but with the ability to scale
   differently in each dimension and derivatives that describe how all
   the parameters change over time.

4.1.2.  Player Head

   Head1 ::= tagHead1 Length ObjectID Time1
     Loc2 Rot2
     ( tagHeadIpd Length Float16 /* IPD */ )?

Internet-Draft             Game State over RTP                March 2022


   Defines location and rotation of head with optional interpupillary
   distance (IPD).

4.1.3.  Mesh

   Object with the following variable length arrays:

   Mesh1 ::= tagMesh1 Length ObjectID
    ( TextureUrl1 | TextureRtpPT1 )
    VarUInt /* num Vertexes */
    Loc1+ /* vertexes */
    VarUInt /* numNormals */
    Norm1* /* normals */
    VarUInt /*  numTextureCoord */
    TextureUV1* /*  textureCoord */
    VarUInt /* numTrianglesIndex */
    VarUInt+ /* trianglesIndex */

   The vertex is an array of at least 3 locations that defines the
   vertex of a triangle mesh.  The normals array can either be empty or
   the same size as the vertex and defines the normal for each vertex.
   The uv array must be empty or the same size as vertex array and have
   the u,v coordinate in the texture map for the vertex.

   The texture can be defined by a URL that may refer to some local
   resource or a resource retrieved over the network.  Alternatively,
   the texture can reference a local RTP video stream, in which case the
   most recently received frame of video is used as the texture and
   texture updates with new frames of video.

   The triangles array can be of a different size from the vertex array.
   Each entry defines one triangle in the mesh and contains the index of
   the three vertexes in the vertexes array.  Vertexes MUST be in
   counter clockwise order.

   An important limitation to note is that objects cannot span RTP
   packets so the Mesh needs to be small enough that it size is less
   that the MTU.  A typical limit might be as low as 50 triangles.

4.1.4.  External Mesh

   The Mesh2 object allows a mesh to be loaded from an external URL and
   then moved, rotated, and scaled.  An optional texture map may be
   used.

   Mesh2::= tagMesh2 Length ObjectID
     Loc2 Rot2 Scale2
     MeshUrl1
     ( TextureUrl1 | TextureRtpPT1 )? /* Optional Texture Map */
     ( tagParent1 Length ObjectID )? /* Optional Parent */

4.1.5.  Player Hand

   Hand1 ::= tagHand1 Length ObjectID Time1
    Boolean /* left */
    Loc2 Rot2

   The Hand1 identifies a location and rotation of a hand.  The left is
   true for the left hand, false for a right hand.

   Hand2 ::= tagHand2 Length ObjectID Time1
    Boolean /* left */
    Loc2 Rot2
    Transform1 /* wrist */
    Transform1 /* thumbTip */
    Transform1 /* thumbIP */
    Transform1 /* thumbMCP */
    Transform1 /* thumbCMC */
    Transform1 /* indexTip */
    Transform1 /* indexDIP */
    Transform1 /* indexPIP */
    Transform1 /* indexMCP */
    Transform1 /* indexCMC */
    Transform1 /* middleTip */
    Transform1 /* middleDIP */
    Transform1 /* middlePIP */
    Transform1 /* middleMCP */
    Transform1 /* middleCMC */
    Transform1 /* ringTip */
    Transform1 /* ringDIP */
    Transform1 /* ringPIP */
    Transform1 /* ringMCP */
    Transform1 /* ringCMC */
    Transform1 /* pinkyTip */
    Transform1 /* pinkyDIP */
    Transform1 /* pinkyPIP */
    Transform1 /* pinkyMCP */
    Transform1 /* pinkyCMC */

   Hand2 represents a wired skeletal hand.  The boolean is true for the
   left hand.  The location should represent the location of the palm
   and rotation is from the palm facing the x axis.

   The transform points represent the relative location to the main
   joints in the fingers from the hand location.  The location of the
   wrist is followed by finger joints.  The fingers are ordered by
   thumb, index, middle, ring, then pinky.  The joints are ordered by
   tip of finger (TIP), distal interphalangeal joint (DIP), proximal
   interphalangeal joint (PIP), metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP), then
   carpometacarpal joint (CMC).  Note the thumb has no middle phalange
   so the PIP and DIP joint just become the interphalangeal joint (IP).

   Note: The Microsoft documentation calls the MCP "knuckle" for the
   fingers and PIP "middle joint" and the CMC is called "Metacarpal",
   which is very confusing since this is not the metacarpophalangeal
   joint.  The MCP for the thumb gets called "proximal", not knuckle,
   and the IP is "middle".

   Names of the joints are explained in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   Interphalangeal_joints_of_the_hand (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   Interphalangeal_joints_of_the_hand)]

   This is about 175 bytes, so at a 5Hz update rate this will be around
   10 Kbps.  [TODO: Check.]

5.  Encoding

   Each RTP payload will contain one or more objects.  An object cannot
   be split across two RTP packets.  The general design is that if the
   decoder has not been coded to understand a given object type, the
   decode can skip over the object to the next object but will not be
   able to provide any information and the internal format of the data.

   The objects are defined such that they always start with a tag that
   indicates the type followed by a length of the object (so it can be
   skipped).  Any optional or variable parts of the object also use tags
   so that the decoder can always be implemented as a LL(1) parser.

   In general, network byte order encoding is used on the wire.

   A length field is encoded to represent the number of bytes following
   the length field and does not include the size of the length field or
   information before it.

5.1.  Tag

   Constant values of tags can be found in the IANA section.  They are
   encoded as VarUInt.

5.2.  Float

   Float16, Float32, and Float64 are encoded as IEEE 754 half, single,
   and double precisions respectively.

   The half precision are often useful for things where only a few
   significant digits are needed such as normals.  The internal
   representation of them will often be single precession (four bytes)
   in memory but they can be reduced to two bytes when encoded on the
   wire.

   Note there is an example decode for a single precision float at
   [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7049#appendix-D
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7049#appendix-D)]

5.3.  Boolean

   Encoded as byte with 0 for false or 1 for true.

5.4.  Integer

   UInt8, Int8, UInt16, Int16, UInt32, Int32, UInt16, Int64 encoded as
   1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes.

   VarInt is encoded as:

   *  Top bits of first byte is 0, then 7 bit signed integer (-64 to 63)

   *  Top bits of first byte is 10, then 6+8 bit signed integer (-8192
      to 8191)

   *  Top bits of first byte is 110, then 5+16 bit signed integer
      (1,048,576 to 1,048,575)

   *  Top bits of first byte is 1110,0001 then next 4 bytes 32 bit
      signed integer

   *  Top bits of first byte is 1110,0010 then next 8 bytes 64 bit
      signed integer

   VarUInt is encoded as:

   *  Top bits of first byte is 0, then 7 bit unsigned integer

   *  Top bits of first byte is 10, then 6+8 bit unsigned integer

   *  Top bits of first byte is 110, then 5+16 bit unsigned integer

      unsigned integer

5.5.  String

   Strings are encoded as a VarUInt length in bytes (not characters)
   followed by a UTF-8 representation of the string.

5.6.  Blob

   Blobs are encoded as a VarUInt length in bytes followed by the binary
   data that goes in the blob.

6.  Full Intra Request

   RTP supports a Full Intra Request (FIR) Feedback Control feedback
   messages.  When an RTP sender receives a FIR, it SHOULD send a copy
   of all the relevant game state.

7.  IANA

8.  RTP

   This section can be split out a separate payload draft we need some
   extra work.

   The media type is application/gamestate.  There are no optional or
   required parameters.  The RTP marker bit is not used.  The RTP clock
   MUST be 90 kHz.

   Multiple Objects as defined in this specification can be concatenated
   into one RTP payload.

   TODO: The SDP MAY include an objectTags type that indicates the tag
   values of all the supported objects types.

   TODO: define storage format as well as RTP payload format details.

8.1.  Game State Tag Registry

   The specification defines a new IANA registry for tag values.  All
   values MUST be greater than zero.

   Values 1-127 are assigned by "IETF Review" as defined in [RFC8126],
   and should only be used when size is critical, the object is small,
   and will be used frequently.

   Values 127-16383 are assigned by "Specification Required" as defined
   in [RFC8126].

   Values 16384 to 2,097,151 are "First Come First Served" as defined in
   [RFC8126].

   Initial assignments are:

9.  Security

   Like most things in RTP, the data can be personal identifying
   information.  For example, the Hand2 type of data when generated by
   tracking a persons hand might identify that user.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments
