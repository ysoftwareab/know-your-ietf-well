Abstract



     GRE specifies a protocol  for encapsulation of an arbitrary
   protocol over another arbitrary network layer protocol. This document
   describes extensions  by which  two  fields,  Key and  Sequence
   Number, can  be optionally carried  in the GRE (Generic  Routing
   Encapsulation) Header [1].

Internet Draft   Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE    June, 2000


  


1. Introduction



      The current specification of Generic Routing Encapsulation [1]
   specifies a protocol for encapsulation of an arbitrary protocol over
   another arbitrary network layer protocol. This document describes
   enhancements by which two fields, Key and Sequence Number, can be
   optionally carried in The GRE Header [1]. Key field is intended to be
   used for identifying an individual traffic flow within a tunnel.
   Sequence Number field is used to maintain sequence of packets within
   The GRE Tunnel.

1.1. Specification Language


      The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
      this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

      In addition, the following words are used to signify the
      requirements of the specification.

      Silently discard
                 The implementation discards the datagram without
                 further processing, and without indicating an error
                 to the sender.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
                 capability of logging the error, including the contents
                 of the discarded datagram, and SHOULD record the event
                 in a statistics counter.

2. Extensions to GRE Header



      The GRE packet header[1] has the following format:

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

Internet Draft   Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE    June, 2000


       The proposed GRE header will have the following format:

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       |                         Key (optional)                        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                 Sequence Number (Optional)                    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


         Key Present (bit 2)

         If the Key Present bit is set to 1, then it indicates that the
         Key field is present in the GRE header.  Otherwise, the Key
         field is not present in the GRE header.

         Sequence Number Present (bit 3)

         If the Sequence Number Present bit is set to 1, then it
         indicates that the Sequence Number field is present.
         Otherwise,  the Sequence Number field is not present in 
         the GRE header.

         The Key and Sequence Present bits are chosen to be compatible
         with RFC 1701 [2].


2.1. Key Field (4 octets)


        The Key field contains a  four octet number which was inserted
   by the encapsulator. The  actual method by which this  Key is
   obtained is beyond the scope of The document. Key field is intended
   to be used for identifying an  individual traffic flow within a
   tunnel. For example, packets may need to be routed based on context
   information not present in the  encapsulated data.   The Key field
   provides this  context and defines a logical traffic  flow between
   encapsulator and decapsulator.  Packets belonging to  a traffic flow
   are encapsulated  using the same Key  value and  the decapsulating
   tunnel endpoint  identifies packets belonging to a traffic flow based
   on the Key Field value.

2.2. Sequence Number (4 octets)




Dommety                                                         [Page 3]





Internet   Draft Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE    June, 2000


       The Sequence Number field is a four byte field and is inserted by
   the encapsulator when Sequence Number Present Bit is set. The
   Sequence Number MUST be used by the receiver to establish the order
   in which packets have been transmitted from the encapsulator to the
   receiver.  The intended use of the Sequence Field is to provide
   unreliable but in-order delivery.  If the Key present bit (bit 2) is
   set, the sequence number is specific to the traffic flow identified
   by the Key field. Note that packets without the sequence bit set can
   be interleaved with packets with the sequence bit set.

       The sequence number value ranges from 1 to 2**32-1.  The first
   datagram is sent with a sequence number of 1. The sequence number is
   thus a free running counter represented modulo 2**32, with the
   exception that 1 is used when modulo 2**32 results in 0 (i.e., roll-
   over to 1 instead of 0).

       When the decapsulator receives an out-of sequence packet it
   SHOULD be silently discarded. A packet is considered an out-of-
   sequence packet if the sequence number of the received packet is
   lesser than or equal to the sequence number of last successfully
   decapsulated packet. The sequence number of a received message is
   considered less than or equal to the last successfully received
   sequence number if its value lies in the range of the last received
   sequence number and the preceding 2**31-1 values, inclusive.

       If the received packet is an in-sequence packet, it is
   successfully decapsulated.  Note that the sequence number is used to
   detect lost packets and/or restore the original sequence of packets
   (with buffering) that may have been reordered during transport.  Use
   of the sequence number option should be used appropriately; in
   particular, it is a good idea a avoid using when tunneling protocols
   that have higher layer in-order delivery mechanisms or are tolerant
   to out-of-order delivery. If only at certain instances the protocol
   being carried in the GRE tunnel requires in-sequence delivery, only
   the corresponding packets encapsulated in a GRE header can be sent
   with the sequence bit set.  Mechanisms to determine which packets
   need to be sent in-sequence and the signaling mechanisms are outside
   the scope of this document.

2.2.1 Re-ordering of Out-of-Sequence packets



       Sequence Number field is used to maintain sequence of packets
   within a GRE Tunnel and the intended use of the Sequence Field is to
   provide unreliable and in-order delivery. The sequence number MAY be
   used to restore the original sequence of packets that may have been
   reordered during transport.



Dommety                                                         [Page 4]





Internet Draft   Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE    June, 2000


       Reordering of out-of sequence packets MAY be performed by the
   decapsulator for improved performance and tolerance to reordering in
   the network.  A small amount of reordering buffer may help in
   improving performance when the higher layer employs stateful
   compression or encryption.  Since the state of the stateful
   compression or encryption is reset by packet loss, it might help the
   performance to tolerate some small amount of packet reordering in the
   network by buffering.  When a specific implementation intends to
   perform reordering, care should be taken to implement buffering
   schemes with caution, as some implementations could lead to
   degradation in performance of the tunnel endpoint and also to buffer
   over flows.  Exact buffering schemes and methods to determine when a
   packet with a certain sequence number is considered lost are outside
   the scope of this document.

       A possible method to determine when a packet with a certain
   sequence number is considered lost is by implementing a timer-based
   mechanism (i.e, implementing an OUTOFORDER_TIMER) along with
   maintaince of a per-flow buffer of a limited size
   (MAX_PERFLOW_BUFFER).  With a timer-based mechanism, when an out-of-
   order packet arrives, the tunnel endpoint starts a timer with a value
   of OUTOFORDER_TIMER. For example a packet with a sequence number N+M
   (value of M is greater than 0) while waiting for the packet with the
   sequence number N the OUTOFORDER_TIMER is started.  If the packet
   with the sequence number N does not arrive prior to the expiry of
   this timer, the packet with the sequence number N is considered lost.
   Note that this method could lead to buffer overflow depending of the
   value of the OUTOFORDER_TIMER. In order to avoid buffer overflows, a
   per-flow buffer (MAX_PERFLOW_BUFFER) is maintained. When there are
   MAX_PERFLOW_BUFFER number of packets to be dequeued (i.e., the buffer
   is full), if a new packet arrives prior to the arrival of the packet
   with a sequence number value of N and prior to the expiry of the
   OUTOFORDER_TIMER, the packet with sequence number of N is considered
   lost and the next packet with the smallest valid sequence number
   (sequence number of N+K, where K is the smallest possible among the
   packets waiting to be decapsulated) is decapsulated.


3. Security Considerations


       This document  describes extensions by  which two fields,  Key
   and Sequence Number, can be optionally carried in the GRE (Generic
   Routing Encapsulation) Header  [1].  When using the Sequence  number
   field, it is possible  to inject packets  with an arbitrary Sequence
   number and launch a Denial  of Service attack.  In order  to protect
   against such attacks, IP  security protocols  [4] MUST be  used to
   protect  the GRE header and  the tunneled payload.  Either  ESP

Internet Draft   Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE    June, 2000


   (Encapsulating Security Payload) [5] or AH (Authentication
   Header)[6] MUST be used to protect the  GRE header.  If ESP  is  used
   it  protects the  IP payload  which includes the  GRE header. If AH
   is used, the entire  packet other than the  mutable fields  are
   authenticated.  Note  that Key  field is  not involved in any sort or
   security (despite its name).


4. IANA Considerations


      This document does not require any allocations by the IANA and
   therefore does not have any new IANA considerations.
