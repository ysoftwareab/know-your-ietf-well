         Advertising L2 Bundle Member Link Attributes in IS-IS
                    draft-ietf-isis-l2bundles-07.txt

Abstract

   There are deployments where the Layer 3 interface on which IS-IS
   operates is a Layer 2 interface bundle.  Existing IS-IS
   advertisements only support advertising link attributes of the Layer
   3 interface.  If entities external to IS-IS wish to control traffic
   flows on the individual physical links which comprise the Layer 2
   interface bundle link attribute information about the bundle members
   is required.

   This document introduces the ability for IS-IS to advertise the link
   attributes of layer 2 (L2) bundle members.

1.  Introduction

   There are deployments where the Layer 3 interface on which an IS-IS
   adjacency is established is a Layer 2 interface bundle, for instance
   a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX].  This reduces the
   number of adjacencies which need to be maintained by the routing
   protocol in cases where there are parallel links between the
   neighbors.  Entities external to IS-IS such as Path Computation
   Elements (PCE) [RFC4655] may wish to control traffic flows on
   individual members of the underlying Layer 2 bundle.  In order to do
   so link attribute information about individual bundle members is

   required.  The protocol extensions defined in this document provide
   the means to advertise this information.

   This document introduces a new TLV to advertise link attribute
   information for each of the L2 bundle members which comprise the
   Layer 3 interface on which IS-IS operates.

   [SR-ISIS] introduces a new link attribute - adjacency segment
   identifier (Adj-SID) - which can be used as an instruction to
   forwarding to send traffic over a specific link.  This document
   introduces additional sub-TLVs to advertise Adj-SIDs for L2 Bundle
   members.

   Note that the new advertisements defined in this document are
   intended to be provided to external (to IS-IS) entities.  The
   following items are intentionally not defined and/or are outside the
   scope of this document:

   o  What link attributes will be advertised.  This is determined by
      the needs of the external entities.

   o  A minimum or default set of link attributes.

   o  How these attributes are configured

   o  How the advertisements are used

   o  What impact the use of these advertisements may have on traffic
      flow in the network

   o  How the advertisements are passed to external entities

2.  L2 Bundle Member Attributes TLV

   A new TLV is introduced to advertise L2 Bundle member attributes.
   Although much of the information is identical to and uses the same
   sub-TLVs included in Extended IS-Neighbor advertisements (TLVs 22 and
   222), a new TLV is used so that changes to the advertisement of the
   L2 Bundle member link attributes does not trigger unnecessary action
   by the [ISO10589] Decision process.

   Advertisement of this information implies that the identified link is
   a member of the L2 Bundle associated with the identified Parent L3
   Neighbor and that the member link is operationally up.  Therefore
   advertisements MUST be withdrawn if the link becomes operationally
   down or it is no longer a member of the identified L2 Bundle.

Internet-Draft               isis-l2bundles                     May 2017


   This new TLV utilizes the sub-TLV space defined for TLVs 22, 23, 141,
   222, and 223.

   The following new TLV is introduced:

       L2 Bundle Member Attributes
       Type: 25 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
       Length: Number of octets to follow

       Parent L3 Neighbor Descriptor
        L3 Neighbor System ID + pseudonode ID (7 octets)
        Flags: 1 octet field of following flags:

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |P|             |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

           where:

           P-flag: When set to 1 one of the sub-TLVs described
           in Section 2.1 immediately follows the flags field.
           If the P-flag is set to 0, then none of the sub-TLVs
           described in Section 2.1 are present.

           Other bits: MUST be zero when originated and ignored when
            received.

      One or more of the following:
       L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptors
         Length of L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptor (1 octet)
           NOTE: This includes all fields described below.

         Number of L2 Bundle Member Descriptors (1 octet)
         L2 Bundle Member Link Local Identifiers
           (4 * Number of L2 Bundle Member Descriptors octets)

           NOTE: An L2 Bundle Member Descriptor is a Link Local
           Identifier as defined in [RFC4202].

         sub-TLV(s)

         A sub-TLV may define an attribute common to all of
         the bundle members listed or a sub-TLV may define an
         attribute unique to each bundle member. Use of these
         two classes of sub-TLVs is described in the following
         sections.




Ginsberg, et al.        Expires November 26, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               isis-l2bundles                     May 2017


   NOTE: Only one Parent L3 Neighbor Descriptor is present in a given
   TLV.  Multiple L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptors may be present in a
   single TLV.

2.1.  Parallel L3 Adjacencies

   When there exist multiple L3 adjacencies to the same neighbor
   additional information is required to uniquely identify the L3
   Neighbor.  One and only one of the following three sub-TLVs is used
   to uniquely identify the L3 adjacency:

   o  IPv4 Interface Address (sub-TLV 6 defined in [RFC5305])

   o  IPv6 Interface Address (sub-TLV 12 defined in [RFC6119])

   o  Link Local/Remote Identifiers (sub-TLV 4 defined in [RFC5307])

   When the P-bit is set in the flags field in the Parent L3 Neighbor
   Descriptor one and only one of the above sub-TLVs MUST be present.
   The chosen sub-TLV MUST immediately follow the flags field described
   in Section 2.

   These sub-TLVs MAY be omitted if no parallel adjacencies to the
   neighbor exist.

2.2.  Shared Attribute sub-TLVs

   These sub-TLVs advertise a single copy of an attribute (e.g. link
   bandwidth).  The attribute applies to all of the L2 Bundle Members in
   the set advertised under the preceding  L2 Bundle Member Attribute
   Descriptor.  No more than one copy of a given sub-TLV in this
   category may appear in the set of sub-TLVs under the preceding L2
   Bundle Member Attribute Descriptor.  If multiple copies of a given
   sub-TLV are present all copies MUST be ignored.

   The set of L2 Bundle Member Descriptors which may be advertised under
   a single L2 Bundle Member Attribute Descriptor is therefore limited
   to bundle members which share the set of attributes advertised in the
   shared attribute sub-TLVs.

   All existing sub-TLVs defined in the IANA Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23,
   141, 222, and 223 registry are in the category of shared attribute
   sub-TLVs unless otherwise specified in this document.

3.  Advertising L2 Bundle Member Adj-SIDs

   [SR-ISIS] defines sub-TLVs to advertise Adj-SIDs for L3 adjacencies.
   However these sub-TLVs only support a advertisement of a single Adj-
   SID.  As it is expected that each L2 Bundle member will have unique
   Adj-SIDs in many deployments it is desirable to define a new sub-TLV
   which allows more efficient encoding of a set of Adj-SIDs in a single
   sub-TLV.  Two new sub-TLVs are therefore introduced to support
   advertising Adj-SIDs for L2 Bundle members.  The format of the new
   sub-TLVs is similar to that used for L3 adjacencies, but is optimized
   to allow advertisement of a set of Adj-SIDs (one per L2 Bundle
   Member) in a single sub-TLV.

   The two new sub-TLVs defined in the following sections do not fall
   into the category of shared attribute sub-TLVs.

3.1.  L2 Bundle Member Adjacency Segment Identifier sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV is used to advertise Adj-SIDs for L2 Bundle Members
   associated with a parent L3 adjacency which is Point-to-Point.  The
   following format is defined for this sub-TLV:

     Type: 41 (suggested value to be assigned by IANA) (1 octet)
     Length: variable (1 octet)


     Flags: 1 octet field of following flags:

          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |F|*|V|L|S|P|   |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        where:

         NOTE: The flags are deliberately kept congruent to the flags
         in the L3 ADJ-SID defined in [SR-ISIS].
         * indicates a flag used in the L3 Adj-SID sub-TLV but which is
         NOT used in this sub-TLV. These bits SHOULD be sent as 0 and
         MUST be ignored on receipt.

         F-Flag: Address-Family flag.  If unset, then the Adj-SID refers
         to an L2 Bundle Member with outgoing IPv4 encapsulation. If set
         then the Adj-SID refers to an L2 Bundle Member with outgoing
         IPv6 encapsulation.

         V-Flag: Value flag.  If set, then the Adj-SID carries a value.
         By default the flag is SET.

Internet-Draft               isis-l2bundles                     May 2017


         L-Flag: Local Flag.  If set, then the value/index carried by
         the Adj-SID has local significance.  By default the flag is
         SET.

         S-Flag.  Set Flag.  When set, the S-Flag indicates that the
         Adj-SID refers to a set of L2 Bundle Members (and therefore
         MAY be assigned to other L2 Bundle Members as well).

         P-Flag.  Persistent flag.  When set, the P-Flag indicates that
         the Adj-SID is persistently allocated, i.e., the Adj-SID value
         remains consistent across router restart and/or interface flap.

         Other bits: MUST be zero when originated and ignored when
         received.

    Weight: 1 octet.  The value represents the weight of the Adj-SID
        for the purpose of load balancing.  The use of the weight is
        defined in [SR-ARCH].

    NOTE: Flags and weight are shared by all L2 Bundle Members
    listed in the L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptor.

    L2 Bundle Member Adj-SID Descriptors. There MUST be one descriptor
     for each of the L2 Bundle Members advertised under the preceding
     L2 Bundle Member Attribute Descriptor. Each descriptor consists
     of one of the following fields:

      SID/Index/Label: according to the V and L flags, it contains
        either:

        *  A 3 octet local label where the 20 rightmost bits are used
           for encoding the label value.  In this case the V and L
           flags MUST be set.

        *  A 4 octet index defining the offset in the SID/Label space
           advertised by this router. See [SR-ISIS].
           In this case V and L flags MUST be unset.



3.2.  L2 Bundle Member LAN Adjacency Segment Identifier sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV is used to advertise Adj-SIDs for L2 Bundle Members
   associated with a parent L3 adjacency which is a LAN adjacency.  In
   LAN subnetworks, the Designated Intermediate System (DIS) is elected
   and originates the Pseudonode-LSP (PN-LSP) including all neighbors of
   the DIS.  When Segment Routing is used, each router in the LAN MAY
   advertise the Adj-SID of each of its neighbors on the LAN.

Internet-Draft               isis-l2bundles                     May 2017


   Similarly, for each L2 Bundle Member a router MAY advertise an Adj-
   SID to each neighbor on the LAN.

   The following format is defined for this sub-TLV:

     Type: 42 (suggested value to be assigned by IANA) (1 octet)
     Length: variable (1 octet)
     Neighbor System ID: 6 octets


     Flags: 1 octet field of following flags:

          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |F|*|V|L|S|P|   |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        where:

         NOTE: The flags are deliberately kept congruent to the flags
         in the L3 LAN_ADJ-SID defined in [SR-ISIS].
         * indicates a flag used in the L3 Adj-SID sub-TLV but which is
         NOT used in this sub-TLV. These bits SHOULD be sent as 0 and
         MUST be ignored on receipt.

         F-Flag: Address-Family flag.  If unset, then the Adj-SID refers
         to an L2 Bundle Member with outgoing IPv4 encapsulation. If set
         then the Adj-SID refers to an L2 Bundle Member with outgoing
         IPv6 encapsulation.

         V-Flag: Value flag.  If set, then the Adj-SID carries a value.
         By default the flag is SET.

         L-Flag: Local Flag.  If set, then the value/index carried by
         the Adj-SID has local significance.  By default the flag is
         SET.

         S-Flag.  Set Flag.  When set, the S-Flag indicates that the
         Adj-SID refers to a set of L2 Bundle Members (and therefore
         MAY be assigned to other L2 Bundle Members as well).

         P-Flag.  Persistent flag.  When set, the P-Flag indicates that
         the Adj-SID is persistently allocated, i.e., the Adj-SID value
         remains consistent across router restart and/or interface flap.

         Other bits: MUST be zero when originated and ignored when
         received.

    Weight: 1 octet.  The value represents the weight of the Adj-SID
    for the purpose of load balancing.  The use of the weight is
    defined in [SR-ARCH].

    NOTE: Flags and weight are shared by all L2 Bundle Members

    L2 Bundle Member LAN Adj-SID Descriptors. There MUST be one
    descriptor for each of the L2 Bundle Members advertised
    under the preceding L2 Bundle Member Attribute Descriptor.
    Each descriptor consists of one of the following fields:

      SID/Index/Label: according to the V and L flags, it contains
        either:

        *  A 3 octet local label where the 20 rightmost bits are used
           for encoding the label value.  In this case the V and L
           flags MUST be set.

        *  A 4 octet index defining the offset in the SID/Label space
           advertised by this router. See [SR-ISIS].
           In this case V and L flags MUST be unset.



4.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds the following new TLV to the IS-IS TLV Codepoints
   registry.

   Value: 25 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: L2 Bundle Member Attributes

   The name of the Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222, and 223 registry
   needs to be changed to Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 25, 141, 222, and
   223 registry.  An additional column needs to be added to the registry
   to indicate which sub-TLVs may appear in the new L2 Bundle Member
   Attributes TLV.  The column for TLV 25 has one of the following three
   values:

   y - sub-TLV may appear in TLV 25 but MUST NOT be shared by multiple
       L2 Bundle Members
   y(s) - sub-TLV may appear in TLV 25 and MAY be shared by multiple
       L2 Bundle Members
   n - sub-TLV MUST NOT appear in TLV 25

5.  Security Considerations

   The IS-IS protocol has supported the advertisement of link attribute
   information, including link identifiers, for many years.  The
   advertisements defined in this document are identical to existing
   advertisements defined in [RFC4202], [RFC5305], [RFC7810], and [SR-
   ISIS] - but are associated with L2 links which are part of a bundle
   interface on which the IS-IS protocol operates.  There are therefore
   no new security issues introduced by the extensions in this document.

   As always, if the protocol is used in an environment where
   unauthorized access to the physical links on which IS-IS PDUs are
   sent occurs then attacks are possible.  The use of authentication as
   defined in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310] is recommended to prevent such
   attacks.

Appendix A.  Example Encoding

   Below is an example encoding of L2 Bundle advertisements in a case
   where we have two parallel adjacencies to the same neighbor whose
   system-id is 1234.1234.1234.00.  The two L2 bundles have the
   following sets of attributes:

   L3 Adjacency #1
   L3 IPv4 local link address: 192.0.2.1
   Four bundle members with the following attributes:

   --------------------------------------------------

   L3 Adjacency #2
   L3 IPv4 local link address: 192.0.2.2
   Three bundle members with the following attributes:

   --------------------------------------------------
   Num | Link Local ID | Bandwidth | Adj-SID/Weight |
   --------------------------------------------------
   1   | 0x22221111    | 10G       | 22221/1        |
