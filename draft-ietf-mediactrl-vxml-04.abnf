   Parameters of the Request-URI in subsequent re-INVITEs are ignored.
   One consequence of this is that the VoiceXML Media Server cannot be
   instructed by the Application Server to change the executing VoiceXML
   Application after a VoiceXML Session has been started.

   Special characters contained in the dialog-param, postbody-param,
   ccxml-param, and aai-param values must be URL-encoded ("escaped") as
   required by the SIP URI syntax, for example '?' (%3f), '=' (%3d), and
   ';' (%3b).  The VoiceXML Media Server MUST therefore unescape these
   parameter values before making use of them or exposing them to
   running VoiceXML applications.  It is important that the VoiceXML
   Media Server only unescape the parameter values once since the
   desired VoiceXML URI value could itself be URL encoded, for example.

   Since some applications may choose to transfer confidential
   information, the VoiceXML Media Server MUST support the sip: scheme
   as discussed in Section 9.

   Informative note: With respect to the postbody-param value, since the
   application/x-www-form-urlencoded content itself escapes non-
   alphanumeric characters by inserting %HH replacements, the escaping
   rules above will result in the '%' characters being further escaped
   in addition to the '&' and '=' name/value separators.

   As an example, the following SIP Request-URI identifies the use of
   VoiceXML media services, with
   'http://appserver.example.com/promptcollect.vxml' as the initial
   VoiceXML document, to be fetched with max-age/max-stale values of
   3600s/0s respectively:

       sip:dialog@mediaserver.example.com; \
voicexml=http://appserver.example.com/promptcollect.vxml; \
maxage=3600;maxstale=0

voicexml=http://as1.example.com/da.vxml
