1.  Introduction

   The US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is rolling out 
   their Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architecture at this 
   time.  This network will require more Resource-Priority 
   namespaces than were defined, and IANA registered, in RFC 4412 
   [RFC4412].  The purpose of this document is to define these 
   additional namespaces.  Each will be preemption in nature, as 
   defined in RFC 4412, and will have the same 9 priority-values.  

   DISA has a requirement to be able to assign different 
   Resource-Priority namespaces to different units of differing sizes 
   throughout their networks.  Examples of this may be

   - as large as each branch of service (army, navy, air force, 
     marines, coast guard)

   - some departments within the government (Homeland Security, 
     Commerce, Treasury) 

   - plus have temporary assignments to individual units of varying 
     sizes (from battle groups to patrol groups or platoons)

   These temporary assignments might be combinations of smaller units 
   involving several branches of service operating as one unit (say, 
   one task force, which is separate than the branch of service), or a 
   single commando unit requiring special treatment for a short period 
   of time, making it appear separate from the branch of service they 
   are from.

   Providing DISA with a pool of namespaces for fine grained 
   assignment(s) allows them the flexibility they need for their 
   mission requirements.  One can imagine due to their sheer size and 
   separation of purpose, they can easily utilize a significant number 
   of namespaces within their networks.  This is the reason for the 
   assignment of so many new namespaces, which seems to deviate from

   guidance in RFC 4412 to have a few namespaces as possible.  

   This document makes no changes to SIP, just adds IANA registered 
   namespaces for its use.


1.1  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in [RFC2119].


2.  New SIP Resource-Priority Namespaces Created

   The following 50 SIP namespaces are created by this document:

      dsn-000000      drsn-000010      rts-000020      crts-000000   
      dsn-000001      drsn-000011      rts-000021      crts-000001   
      dsn-000002      drsn-000012      rts-000022      crts-000002
      dsn-000003      drsn-000013      rts-000023      crts-000003
      dsn-000004      drsn-000014      rts-000024      crts-000004
      dsn-000005      drsn-000015      rts-000025      crts-000005
      dsn-000006      drsn-000016      rts-000026      crts-000006
      dsn-000007      drsn-000017      rts-000027      crts-000007
      dsn-000008      drsn-000018      rts-000028      crts-000008
      dsn-000009      drsn-000019      rts-000029      crts-000009

   Each namespace listed above is wholly different. However, according 
   to the rules of section 8 within RFC 4412, one or more sets can be 
   treated as if the same when configured as an aggregated grouping of 
   namespaces.  

   These aggregates of two or more namespaces, that are to be 
   considered equivalent during treatment, can be a set of any IANA 
   registered namespaces, not just adjacent namespaces.

   Each namespace listed above will have the same 9 priority-levels:

      .0 (lowest priority)
      .1 
      .2 
      .3 
      .4 
      .5 
      .6 
      .7 
      .8 
      .9 (highest priority)

   According to the rules established in RFC 4412 [RFC4412], 


Polk                     Expires Sept 10, 2008                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft       New SIP RPH Namespaces for DISA           Mar 2008

   priority-values have a relative order for preferential treatment, 
   unless one or more consecutive groups of priority-values are to be 
   considered equivalent (i.e., first-received, first treated).

   Thus, a message (or a call) with the following Resource-Priority 
   header value: 

      dsn-000001.8

   for example, MUST NOT ever receive preferential treatment over a 
   message, for example, with this Resource-Priority header value:

      dsn-000010.0

   because they are two difference namespaces, unless the namespaces 

      dsn-000001 and dsn-000010

   are configured as equivalent namespaces (according to section 8 of 
   RFC 4412).

   The dash '-' character is just like any other character, and is not 
   to be considered a delimiter in any official way within any 
   namespace here.  Other namespace definitions in the future could 
   change this.

   As stated in Section 9 of RFC 4412 [RFC4412], an IANA registered 
   namespace SHOULD NOT change the number, and MUST NOT change the 
   relative priority order, of its assigned priority-values.


3.  IANA Considerations

   Abiding by the rules established within RFC 4412 [RFC4412], this is 
   a Standards-Track document registering new namespaces, their 
   associated priority-values and intended algorithms.


3.1 IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration 

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" registry in the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the following table lists the new 
   namespaces registered by this document (NOTE: 'RFCXXXX' is to be 
   replaced by this document's RFC number if this document is published
   by the RFC-Editor):
