                                  ABSTRACT 
    
   This memo introduces a low latency and low loss handover protocol 
   that enhances the performance of forwarding from previous care-of 
   address for Mobile IPv6, namely eFWD. The eFWD allows a mobile node 
   to control and initiate creation of a bi-directional tunnel between 
   the old and the new access routers subsequent to link layer 
   handover. The eFWD handover reduces IP handover latency by 
   eliminating new care-of address acquisition time and by identifying 
   new access router information in advance utilizing Candidate Access 
   Router Information Discovery (CARID) process detailed in this memo. 
   The eFWD protocol removes extra burden on link layer by eliminating 
   any requirement on pre-triggers.

   1. Introduction 
    
   The Mobile IP Working Group has considered low latency and low loss 
   handover protocols for Mobile IPv6 that can seamlessly support real-
   time applications. The standard Mobile IPv6 [1] handover process 
   reveals numerous problems manifested by time-consuming network 
   layer-based movement detection, non-optimized time sequencing of 
   handover procedures, and latency of configuring a new care-of 
   address. The Fast Mobile IPv6 Handover Protocol is designed to solve 
   these problems. The current proposal of the fast handover protocol 
   [2] is based on having link layer information available prior to the 
   actual handover so that the mobile node and the access routers 
   should prepare/anticipate for IP handover. In general, the fast 
   handover protocol tends to impose extra set of functions and 
   requirements over the link layer known as link layer triggers (L2 
   triggers) [3]. 
    
   In this memo, an extension of the fast Mobile IPv6 protocol is 
   proposed that allows a mobile node to control and initiate the 
   creation of a bi-directional tunnel between the old and new access 
   routers immediately after link layer handover has been completed, 
   namely Enhanced Forwarding from Previous Care-of Address (eFWD). The 
   eFWD optimizes IP handover latency by eliminating new care-of 
   address acquisition and by identifying new access router information 
   in advance. It should be noted that eFWD is free from link layer 
   pre-triggers.  
    
   2. Terminology 
    
   Mobile Node (MN) 
        A Mobile Node is a Mobile IPv6 host capable of moving its point 
        of attachment to the Internet.

   Access Router (AR) 
        An Access Router is the last router between the network and the    
        mobile node, i.e., the MN has link Layer connectivity to the 
        Access Router. 
    
   Access Point (AP) 
        A first-hop link layer device between the access router and the 
        mobile node. 
      
   Old Access Router (oAR) 
        The access router involved in handling a MN's traffic prior to 
        an L2 Handover.  
       
   New Access Router (nAR)  
        The access router anticipated to be handling a MN's traffic 
        after completion of an L2 handover.  
    
   Old Care-of Address (oCoA)     
        The care-of address prior to the MN's first movement. In this   
        memo, it may be reused until the MN determines an appropriate 
        time to change it, even if the MN changes subnet.  
    
   New Care-of Address (nCoA)  
        The care-of address in the new subnet. In this memo, 
        configuration with a nCoA does not have to take place 
        immediately after L2 handover. 
    
   Bi-directional tunnel (BT)  
        A bi-directional tunnel placed between the ARs where the MN 
        first established its current CoA and a new AR to which the MN 
        is attached where the CoA would be topologically incorrect if 
        used. The new AR tunnels packets from the MN and having the 
        source address as the MN's old CoA to the old AR. The old AR 
        tunnels packets to the MN and having the destination address as 
        the MN's old CoA to new AR. The new AR detunnels the MN-
        directed packets and sends them over the radio link to the MN 
        (and hence there is no tunnel overhead on the air link). The 
        old AR detunnels correspondent node-directed packets and sends 
        them into the subnet where the old CoA is topologically 
        correct. BTs allow use of the old CoA without running the risk 
        of ingress or egress filtering. 
          
   Link-layer Handover (L2 Handover) 
        Movement of a MN's point of layer 2 (L2) connection from one 
        wireless access point to another. Depending on the L2, an L2 
        handover may traverse both a wireless and a wired link, or just 
        a wired link. 
         
   IP Handover (L3 handover) 
        The process by which a MN obtains a new CoA from the AR, thus 
        updating its routing reachability. L3 handover may occur

        partially before and partially after L2 handover, or it may 
        occur entirely after L2 handover.    
    
   Link-layer Trigger (L2 Trigger) 
        Information from L2 that informs L3 of the detailed events 
        involved in handover sequencing at L2. L2 triggers are not 
        specific to any particular L2, but rather represent 
        generalizations of L2 information available from a wide variety 
        of L2 protocols. 
         
   3. Problem Statement and Solution 
    
   The process of Mobile IP network layer handover incurs certain 
   protocol exchanges. These protocol actions are needed to establish 
   on-link connectivity at the new network where a mobile node has 
   moved to, and also to update the remote home agent(s) and end-points 
   for end-to-end connectivity. 
    
   When the standard Mobile IPv6 is used for network layer handovers, 
   the mobile node first needs to detect the network layer movement. 
   This can be accomplished via observing network prefixes, or relying 
   on L2 triggers. The latter provides much quicker detection wherever 
   such link layer support is available. Secondly, the mobile node 
   needs to discover the IPv6 subnet prefix, if it is going to use 
   stateless address auto-configuration. If movement detection were 
   based on listening to router advertisements, this step is already 
   covered. Otherwise, the mobile node needs to send a router 
   solicitation and receive router advertisements from access routers 
   to learn the IPv6 prefixes available on the link. Third step is 
   configuring a new care-of address. Mobile node can auto-configure a 
   new care-of address based on one of the prefixes and has to go 
   through a duplicate address detection [4] to make sure this address 
   is unique. Finally, the mobile node has to send binding updates to 
   its home agent and correspondent nodes to inform them about its new 
   location. 
    
   Mobile node is unreachable from the Internet until its new binding  
   Update is received by the home agent and the correspondent nodes. 
   Each of these steps takes time. Therefore, we are motivated to 
   optimize or eliminate some of these steps to minimize the length of 
   service disruption. 
    
   The L2 triggers are utilized to optimize movement detection process.  
   This saves waiting time to receive few subsequent router 
   advertisements. Binding update process is already optimized by the 
   standard Mobile IPv6 protocol. Binding updates are sent to the old 
   access router instead of home agent when forwarding from the 
   previous care-of address is applied. This optimization saves a round 
   trip time across the Internet. What is left can be summarized as 
   configuring a new care-of address, which relies on prefix discovery 
   and duplicate address detection. Depending on the implementation and 
   configuration, this can be the costliest step among others.

   Latency of configuring a new care-of address can be eliminated if IP 
   address of the new access router (where mobile node has just moved 
   to) is used as the new care-of address momentarily. If the mobile 
   node can send a binding update to the old access router, informing 
   the old care-of address as the home address and IP address of the 
   new access router as the care-of address, forwarding from the 
   previous care-of address is established through a tunnel between the 
   old access router and the new access router. Since the new access 
   router is the tunnel end-point for forwarded packets, it will have 
   to play a role to decapsulate the packets for this method. In 
   standard Mobile IPv6, the new access router does not have this 
   special role and it simply forwards packets for on-link IP addresses 
   without being aware of mobile node's mobility. Once forwarding from 
   the previous care-of address is established, the old access router 
   intercepts packets sent to the old care-of address and tunnels them 
   to the new access router. The new access router decapsulates 
   tunneled packets and forwards them to the mobile node via one of its 
   interfaces. Similarly, packets sent by the mobile node must be 
   intercepted by the new router and tunneled back to the old access 
   router. By doing so, the packets can be forwarded to the mobile node 
   even before the mobile node has to configure a new care-of address 
   using the new prefix. This approach provides an optimized solution 
   for Mobile IPv6 fast handover when accompanied with link-up trigger 
   [3] for movement detection. 
    
   This is a mobile-controlled protocol in which mobile node is in 
   charge of IP handovers. It only relies on the link-up trigger and 
   requires no pre-triggers that are based on movement anticipation. In 
   other words, benefits of this approach are reliability that only a 
   successful link layer handover triggers subsequent IP handovers and 
   independence of complexity in pre-signaling before the actual 
   handover. 
    
   4. The Protocol 
    
   4.1 Overview 
    
   Figure 1 illustrates Enhanced Forwarding from Previous Care-of 
   Address (eFWD) handover. eFWD is initiated by mobile node when it 
   receives a link-up trigger immediately after arriving at the new 
   access point (nAP). The mobile node must send eFWD BU informing the 
   old access router (oAR) about the new care-of address, therefore new 
   access router (nAR) information, so that the oAR can send HI message 
   to the nAR. We describe a method of doing so via Candidate Access 
   Router Information Discovery (CARID) procedure in detail in 4.2.2 of 
   this memo. The CARID allows the mobile node to learn handover 
   candidate access router information at some sufficient time prior to 
   the actual handover. The list of access routers obtained via CARID 
   includes all possible next routers a host might handover to. After a 
   successful link layer handover, mobile node learns the L2 ID of the

   new access point (nAP) and maps it to the link layer and network 
   layer IDs of the corresponding nAR.

   Once MN identifies the information about the nAR, it constructs a BU 
   and sends it to the oAR via nAR. In this BU, home address field is 
   set to the old care-of address, and the care-of address field is set 
   to the IP address of nAR. When this BU reaches at the oAR, HI and 
   HACK messages are exchanged between the oAR and nAR to set up a bi-
   directional tunnel. With BU being acknowledged (i.e. BAck tunneled 
   to the nAR and forwarded to the MN), incoming packets destined to 
   the mobile node's old care-of address are tunneled by the oAR and 
   the nAR decapsulates and forwards them to the mobile node. Finally, 
   the mobile node may decide to acquire a new care-of address at 
   sometime later and update this information with its home agent and 
   all nodes of interest such as correspondent nodes. It can also 
   choose to terminate the forwarding from previous care-of address by 
   sending a de-registration BU to the oAR.

   4.2.2 Candidate Access Router Information Discovery (CARID) 
    
   Fast handover domain is defined by a set of access routers and their 
   associated access points. An access router must maintain either a 
   complete list of all access routers in the domain, or a partial list 
   of access routers that are in the same geographic neighborhood, 
   known as geographically adjacent access routers (GAAR). Subset of 
   the GAARs becomes potential handover candidate access routers for 
   visiting mobile nodes. Each entry in the table must contain IP 
   address of the access router, along with link layer address of the 
   access router and link layer address of the associated access 
   points. When a mobile node associates with an access point, all it 
   can figure out is the link-layer address of the access point. Mobile 
   node can identify the associated access router by doing a look up on 
   this table. If such a look up fails, that means fast handover to 
   this network is not supported and the mobile node has to resort to 
   regular Mobile IPv6 handover. 
    
   Creation and maintenance of this table on the access routers is 
   outside the scope of this memo. It can be done manually or by some 
   dynamic means. 
    
   Mobile node should be able to request this table from its current 
   access router anytime, not necessarily right before a handover.

   [Page 13]                     eFWD                    December 2002 
                                    
   A CARID response carries a list of access routers in its payload.  
   Information related to each access router must begin with Sub-type 1 
   field (i.e. access router's IPv6 address). This data must be 
   followed by the link-layer address(es) of this access router. And 
   each link-layer address of the access router must be followed by 
   link-layer address(es) of the associated access points. All Sub-type 
   2 and Sub-type 3 data before the next sub-type 1 data are associated 
   with the access router identified by the leading sub-type 1 data 
   (IPv6 address). All sub-type 3 data before the next sub-type 1 or 
   sub-type 2 data is associated with the access point identified by 
   the leading sub-type 2 data. 
    
   Data field of a CARID Response must follow an order, such that sub-
   type 1 is always followed by sub-type 2, and sub-type 2 is always 
   followed by sub-type 3. 
    
   5. Security Considerations 
    
   The protocol exchanges defined in this memo cause routing changes. 
   After a successful protocol signaling, access routers create bi-
   directional tunnels and install host-based routes to direct a given 
   mobile node's traffic differently than what they would normally do 
   based on the prefix information. Any protocol signaling that can 
   cause such changes in routing needs to be secured in order to 
   prevent malicious nodes taking advantage of them. 
    
   It is assumed that access routers in a fast handover domain have 
   pre-established security associations among themselves. Therefore, 
   they can use IPSec [5] [6] to secure HI/HAck messages. 
    
   We cannot assume that a similar pre-established security association 
   will be available between the mobile node and every possible access 
   router. Therefore, this security association needs to be created 
   dynamically. Since mobile node has been receiving IP service from 
   the access router even before the signaling of this protocol, it is 
   assumed that they can establish such a security association based on 
   link layer or network layer methods [3] [7]. Specifics of these 
   methods are outside the scope of this work. Once such an association 
   is established, the mobile node and the access routers can use IPSec 
   to secure BU/BAck and the CARID Request/Response messaging.
