                YANG Data Model for DHCPv6 Configuration
                      draft-cui-dhc-dhcpv6-yang-02

Abstract

   There has no unified method to configure DHCPv6 server ,relay and
   client itself, always pre-configured manually by operators.

   IETF netmod WG has developed a general data model for NETCONF
   protocol, YANG data model [RFC6020].

   This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and
   management of DHCPv6 server, DHCPv6 relay and DHCPv6 client.  With
   this model, the operators can configure and manage the devices by
   using NETCONF.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and
   management of DHCPv6 server, DHCPv6 relay and DHCPv6 client.  With
   this model, the operators can configure and manage the devices by
   using NETCONF.

   Model include three sub-modules:

   o  DHCPv6 server

   o  DHCPv6 relay

   o  DHCPv6 client

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] and relevant documents.

   DHCPv6 tree diagrams provide a concise representation of a YANG
   module to help readers understand the module structure.  The meaning
   if the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Braces "{" and "}" enclose feature content.

   o  Parentheses "(" and ")" enclose choice and case nodes, and case
      nodes are also marked with a colon (":").

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, and "*"
      denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

2.  Objectives

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage DHCPv6 server, DHCPv6 relay and DHCPv6 client.

2.1.  DHCPv6 server

   DHCPv6 server parameters.

2.2.  DHCPv6 relay

   DHCPv6 relay parameters.

2.3.  DHCPv6 client

                   Figure 1: DHCPv6 Data Model Structure

   Introduction of important nodes:

   o  serv-attributes: This container contains basic attributes of a
      DHCPv6 server such as DUID, server name and so on.  Some optional
      functions that can be provided by the server is also included.

   o  duid: Each server and client has only one DUID (DHCP Unique
      Identifier).  The DUID here identifies a unique DHCPv6 server for
      clients.

   o  pd-function: Whether the server can act as a delegating router to
      perform prefix delegation ([RFC3633]).

   o  two-step-interaction : A boolean value specifies whether the
      server support client-server exchanges involving two messages
      defined in ([RFC3315]).

   o  rapid-commit: Setting the value to '1' represents the server
      support the Solicit-Reply message exchange. '0' means the server
      will simply ignore the Rapid Commit option in Solicit message.

   o  address-pools: A container describes the DHCPv6 server's address
      pools.

   o  address-pool: A DHCPv6 server can be configured with several
      address pools.  This list defines such address pools which are
      distinguish by the key called "pool-name".

   o  binding-info: A list records a binding information for each DHCPv6
      client that has already been allocated IPv6 addresses.

   o  prefix-pools: If a server supports prefix delegation function,
      this container will be used to define the delegating router's
      prefix pools.

   o  prefix-pool: Similar to server's address pools, a delegating
      router can also be configured with multiple prefix pools specified
      by a list called "prefix-pool".

   o  binding-info: A list records a binding information for each DHCPv6
      requesting router that has already been configured IPv6 prefixes.

   o  other-paras: This container defines extra configuration parameters
      provided by the DHCPv6 server apart from the address and prefix
      information.  Such parameters may include DNS servers, SIP
      servers, SNTP servers, etc.

   o  relay-opaque-paras: This container contains some opaque values in
      Relay Agent options that need to be configured on the server side
      only for value match.  Such Relay Agent options include Interface-
      Id option, Remote-Id option and Subscriber-Id option.

   o  packet-stats: A container presents the packet statistics related
      to the DHCPv6 server.

   Introduction of important nodes:

   o  relay-attributes: A container describes some basic attributes of
      the relay agent including some relay agent specific options data
      that need to be configured previously.  Such options include
      Remote-Id option and Subscriber-Id option.

   o  dest-addrs: Each DHCPv6 relay agent may be configured with a list
      of destination addresses.  This node defines such a list of IPv6
      addresses that may include unicast addresses, multicast addresses
      or other addresses.

   o  relay-interfaces: It is a sub-container of "relayAttributes" that
      defines common configuration and state parameters in the
      interfaces of a DHCPv6 relay agent.

   o  relay-if: A list describes a specific interface and its
      corresponding parameters.  Here we use a string called "ifName" as
      the key of list.

   o  next-entity: This node defines a list that is used to describe the
      next hop entity of this relay agent.  Different entities are
      distinguished by their addresses.

   o  packet-stats: A container shows packet state information of a
      specific data communication.

   o  relay-stats: The "relayStats" container records and presents the
      overall packet statistics of the relay agent.

   Introduction of important nodes:

   o  client-interfaces: A client may have several interfaces, it is
      more reasonable to configure and manage parameters on the
      interface-level.  This container includes configuration and state
      data of a DHCPv6 client in a per-interface manner.

   o  client-if: The list defines a specific client interface and its
      data.  Different interfaces are distinguished by the "ifName" key
      which is a configurable string value.

   o  duid: Each server and client has only one DUID (DHCP Unique
      Identifier).  The DUID here will be carried in the Client ID
      option to identify a specific DHCPv6 client.

   o  cli-fqdn: A DHCPv6 server needs to know the Fully Qualified Domain
      Name (FQDN) of the client to achieve the DNS update.

   o  pd-function: Whether the client can act as a requesting router to
      request prefixes using prefix delegation ([RFC3633]).

   o  rapid-commit: '1' indicates a client can initiate a Solicit-Reply
      message exchange by adding a Rapid Commit option in Solicit
      message. '0' means the client is not allowed to add a Rapid Commit
      option to request addresses in a two-message exchange pattern.

   o  mo-tab: The management tab label indicates the operation mode of
      the DHCPv6 client. 'm'=1 and 'o'=1 indicate the client will use

      DHCPv6 to obtain all the configuration data. 'm'=1 and 'o'=0 are a
      meaningless combination.  'm'=0 and 'o'=1 indicate the client will
      use stateless DHCPv6 to obtain configuration data apart from
      addresses/prefixes data. 'm'=0 and 'o'=0 represent the client will
      not use DHCPv6 but use SLAAC to achieve configuration.

   o  identity-association: IA is a construct through which a server and
      a client can identify, group, and manage a set of related IPv6
      addresses.  The key of the "identity-association" list is a 4-byte
      number IAID defined in [RFC3315] .

   o  if-other-paras: A client can obtain extra configuration data other
      than address and prefix information through DHCPv6.  This
      container describes such data the client was configured.  The
      potential configuration data may include DNS server addresses, SIP
      server domain names, etc.

   o  packet-stats: A container records all the packet status
      information of a specific interface.

      addresses.

   o  prefix-used-up: raised when the prefix pool has run out all it
      prefixes.

   o  invalid-client-detected: raised when the server has found a client
      which can be regarded as a potential attacker.  Some description
      could also be included.

   o  topo-changed: raised when the topology of the relay agent is
      changed.

   o  invalid-ia-detected: raised when the identity association of the
      client can be proved to be invalid.  Possible condition includes
      duplicated address, illegal address, etc.

   o  retransmission-failed: raised when the retransmission mechanism
      defined in [RFC3315] is failed.

   o  failed-status-turn-up: raised when the client receives a message
      includes an unsuccessful Status Code option.
