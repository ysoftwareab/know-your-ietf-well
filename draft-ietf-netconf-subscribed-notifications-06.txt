                  Custom Subscription to Event Streams
             draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications-06

Abstract

   This document defines capabilities and operations for the customized
   establishment of subscriptions upon a publisher's event streams.
   Also defined are delivery mechanisms for instances of the resulting
   notification messages.  Effectively this allows a subscriber to
   request and receive a continuous, custom feed of publisher generated
   information.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines capabilities and operations for the customized
   establishment of subscriptions upon system generated event streams.
   Effectively this enables a "Subscribe then Publish" capability where
   the customized information needs of each target receiver are
   understood by the publisher before subscribed event records are
   marshalled and pushed.  The receiver then gets a continuous, custom
   feed of publisher generated information.

   While the functionality defined in this document is transport-
   agnostic, protocols like NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] can
   be used to configure or dynamically signal subscriptions, and there
   are bindings defined for subscribed event record delivery for NETCONF
   within [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notifications], and for
   HTTP2 or HTTP1.1 within [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-notif].

1.1.  Motivation

   There are various [RFC5277] limitations, many of which have been
   exposed in [RFC7923] which needed to be solved.  Key capabilities
   supported by this document include:

   o  multiple subscriptions on a single transport session

   o  support for dynamic and statically configured subscriptions

   o  modification of an existing subscription

   o  operational counters and instrumentation

   o  negotiation of subscription parameters (through the use of hints
      returned as part of declined subscription requests)

   o  state change notifications (e.g., publisher driven suspension,
      parameter modification)

   o  independence from transport protocol

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Configured subscription: A subscription installed via a configuration
   interface which persists across reboots.

   Dynamic subscription: A subscription agreed between subscriber and
   publisher created via RPC subscription state signaling messages.

   Event: An occurrence of something that may be of interest. (e.g., a
   configuration change, a fault, a change in status, crossing a
   threshold, or an external input to the system.)

   Event record: A set of information detailing an event.

   NACM: NETCONF Access Control Model.

   Notification message: A set of transport encapsulated information
   intended for a receiver indicating that one or more event(s) have
   occurred.  A notification message may include event records.

   Publisher: An entity responsible for streaming notification messages
   per the terms of a Subscription.

   Receiver: A target to which a publisher pushes subscribed event
   records.  For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber are
   the same entity.

   Stream (also referred to as "event stream"): A continuous ordered set
   of events aggregated under some context.

   Stream filter: Evaluation criteria which may be applied against a
   event records within a stream.  Event records pass the filter when
   specified criteria are met.

   Subscribed event records: Event records which have met the terms of
   the subscription.  This include terms (such as security checks)
   enforced by the publisher.

   Subscriber: An entity able to request and negotiate a contract for
   the generation and push of event records from a publisher.

   Subscription: A contract with a publisher, stipulating which
   information one or more receivers wish to have pushed from the
   publisher without the need for further solicitation.

1.3.  Solution Overview

   This document describes a transport agnostic mechanism for
   subscribing to and receiving content from a stream instantiated
   within a publisher.  This mechanism is through the use of a
   subscription.

   Two types of subscriptions are supported:

   1.  Dynamic subscriptions, where a subscriber initiates a
       subscription negotiation with a publisher via RPC.  If the
       publisher wants to serve this request, it accepts it, and then
       starts pushing notification messages.  If the publisher does not
       wish to serve it as requested, then an error response is
       returned.  This response MAY include hints at subscription
       parameters which would have been accepted.

   2.  Configured subscriptions, which allow the management of
       subscriptions via a configuration interface so that a publisher
       can send notification messages to configured receiver(s).
       Support for this capability is optional.

   Additional characteristics differentiating configured from dynamic
   subscriptions include:

   o  The lifetime of a dynamic subscription is bounded by the transport
      session used to establish it.  For connection-oriented stateful
      transport like NETCONF, the loss of the transport session will
      result in the immediate termination of associated dynamic
      subscriptions.  For connectionless or stateless transports like
      HTTP, it is the lack of receipt acknowledgement of a sequential
      set of notification messages and/or keep-alives which will
      terminate dynamic subscriptions.  The lifetime of a configured
      subscription is driven by relevant configuration being present on
      the running configuration.  This implies configured subscriptions
      persist across reboots, and persist even when transport is
      unavailable.

   o  Configured subscriptions can be modified by any configuration
      client with write permission on the configuration of the
      subscription.  Dynamic subscriptions can only be modified via an
      RPC request made upon the original subscribing transport session.

   Note that there is no mixing-and-matching of dynamic and configured
   subscriptions.  Specifically, a configured subscription cannot be
   modified or deleted using RPC.  Similarly, a subscription established
   via RPC cannot be modified through configuration operations (if
   needed, an operator may use a kill RPC however).

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications            October 2017


   The publisher MAY decide to terminate a dynamic subscription at any
   time.  Similarly, it MAY decide to temporarily suspend the sending of
   notification messages for either configured or dynamic subscriptions.
   Such termination or suspension MAY be driven by the publisher running
   out of resources to serve the subscription, or by internal errors on
   the publisher.

1.4.  Relationship to RFC-5277

   This document is intended to provide a superset of the subscription
   capabilities initially defined within [RFC5277].  Especially when
   extending an existing [RFC5277] implementation, it is important to
   understand what has been reused and what has been replaced.  Key
   realtionships between these two documents include:

   o  the data model in this document replaces the data model in
      [RFC5277].

   o  the RPC operations in this draft replaces the symetrical
      operations of [RFC5277], section 4.

   o  the one way operation of [RFC5277] is still used.  However this
      operation will no longer be required with the availability of
      [I.D.draft-ietf-netconf-notification-messages].

   o  the definition and contents of the NETCONF stream are identical
      between this document and [RFC5277].

   o  a publisher MAY implement both the data model and RPCs defined in
      [RFC5277] and this new document concurrently, in order to support
      old clients.  However the use of both alternatives on a single
      transport session is prohibited.

2.  Solution

2.1.  Event Streams

   An event stream is a named entity on a publisher which exposes a
   continuously updating set of events.  Each event stream is available
   for subscription.  It is out of the scope of this document to
   identify a) how streams are defined, b) how events are defined/
   generated, and c) how events are assigned to streams.

   There is only one reserved event stream within this document:
   NETCONF.  The NETCONF event stream contains all NETCONF XML event
   record information supported by the publisher, except for where it
   has been explicitly indicated that this the event record MUST be

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications            October 2017


   excluded from the NETCONF stream.  Beyond NETCONF, implementations
   are free to add additional event streams.

   As events are raised by a system, they may be assigned to one or more
   streams.  The event record is distributed to receivers where: (1) a
   subscription includes the identified stream, and (2) subscription
   filtering does not exclude the event record from that receiver.

   If access control permissions are in use to secure publisher content,
   then for notification messages to be sent to a receiver, that
   receiver MUST be allowed access to all the event records on the
   stream.  If subscriber permissions change during the lifecycle of a
   subscription, then the subscription MUST be continued or terminated
   accordingly.

2.2.  Event Stream Filters

   This document defines an extensible filtering mechanism.  Two
   optional stream filtering syntaxes supported are [XPATH] and subtree
   [RFC6241].  The subsets of these filtering syntaxes supported are
   left to each implementation.  A subset of information is never
   stripped from within the event record.

   If no stream filter is provided, all event records on a stream are to
   be sent.

2.3.  Subscription State Model at the Publisher

   Below is the state machine of a subscription for the publisher for a
   dynamic subscription.  It is important to note that such a
   subscription doesn't exist at the publisher until it is accepted and
   made active.  The mere request by a subscriber to establish a
   subscription is insufficient for that asserted subscription to be
   externally visible via this state machine.

                   Figure 1: Dynamic subscription states

   Of interest in this state machine are the following:

   o  Successful establish or modify RPCs put the subscription into an
      active state.

   o  Failed modify RPCs will leave the subscription in its previous
      state, with no visible change to any streaming updates.

   o  A delete or kill RPC will end the subscription.

   o  Suspend and resume state changes are driven by internal process
      and prioritization.  There are no external controls over suspend
      and resume.

   As shown below, a very similar state machine exists for configured
   subscriptions.  Creation, modification, and deletion is via
   configuration operations rather than via RPC.  When a subscription is
   created, the operational status of each receiver is initially set to
   intializing.  Individual are receivers are moved to an active status
   when a subscription-started state change notification is successfully
   delivered.  From there, the status of each receiver is managed
   internally within the publisher.  Individual receivers are provided
   no information about other receivers from the publisher.

   The interaction model described in this section is mirrored in the
   RPCs and Notifications later in the document.  It should be noted
   that these RPCs and Notifications have been designed to be extensible
   and allow subscriptions into targets other than event streams.
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] provides an example of such an
   extension.

   The top-level decompositions of data model are as follows:

   o  "Streams" contains a list of event streams that are supported by
      the publisher and against which subscription is allowed.

   o  "Filters" contains a configurable list of filters that can be
      applied to a subscription.  This allows users to reference an
      existing filter definition as an alternative to defining a filter
      inline for each subscription.

   o  "Subscription-config" contains the configuration of configured
      subscriptions.  The parameters of each configured subscription are
      a superset of the parameters of a dynamic subscription and use the
      same groupings.  In addition, the configured subscriptions MUST
      also specify intended receivers and MAY specify the push source
      from which to send the stream of notification messages.

   o  "Subscriptions" contains a list of all subscriptions on a
      publisher, both configured and dynamic.  It can be used to
      retrieve information about the subscriptions which a publisher is
      serving.

   The data model also contains a number of YANG Notifications that
   allow a publisher to signal information about a subscription.
   Finally, the data model contains a number of RPC definitions that are
   used to manage dynamic subscriptions.

4.  Dynamic Subscriptions

   Dynamic subscriptions are managed via RPC, and are made against
   targets located within the publisher.  These RPCs have been designed
   extensibly so that they may be augmented for targets beyond event
   streams.

4.1.  Establishing a Subscription

   The "establish-subscription" operation allows a subscriber to request
   the creation of a subscription via RPC.  Multiple establish
   subscription RPC requests can be made within the same transport
   session.

   The input parameters of the operation are:

   o  A stream name which identifies the continuous feed of events
      against which the subscription is applied.

   o  A filter which may reduce the set of event records pushed.

   o  The desired encoding for the notification message.

   o  An optional stop time for the subscription.

   o  An optional start time which indicates that this subscription is
      requesting a replay of previously generated information from the
      event stream.

   If the publisher cannot satisfy the "establish-subscription" request,
   it sends a negative "subscription-result" element.  If the subscriber
   has no authorization to establish the subscription, the
   "subscription-result" indicates an authorization error.  Optionally,
   the "subscription-result" MAY include one or more hints on
   alternative input parameters and value which would have resulted in
   an accepted subscription.

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications            October 2017


   Subscription requests MUST fail if a filter with invalid syntax is
   provided or if a non-existent stream is referenced.

4.1.1.  Replay Subscription

   Replay provides the ability to establish an subscription which is
   also capable of passing along recently generated event records.  In
   other words, as the subscription initializes itself, it sends any
   previously generated content from within target event stream which
   meet the filter and timeframe criteria.  These historical event
   records would then be followed by event records generated after the
   subscription has been established.  All event records will be
   delivered in the order generated.  Replay is only viable for dynamic
   subscriptions.  Replay is an optional feature.  Replay is dependent
   on an event stream supporting some form of logging, although it puts
   no restrictions on the size or form of the log, or where it resides
   within the device.

   The inclusion of a replay-start-time within an "establish-
   subscription" RPC indicates a replay request.  If the "replay-start-
   time" contains a value that is earlier than content stored within the
   publisher's replay buffer, then the subscription MUST be rejected,
   and the leaf "replay-start-time-hint" MUST be set in the reply.

   An end time MAY be specified using the optional stop-time parameter,
   which only in the case of replay MAY also be earlier than the current
   time.  If no stop-time is present, notification messages will
   continue to be sent until the subscription is terminated.  The
   publisher MUST NOT accept a replay-start-time for a future time.

   If the replay-start-time is later than any information stored in the
   replay buffer, then the publisher MUST send a "replay-completed"
   notification immediately after the "subscription-started"
   notification.

   Not all streams will support replay.  Those that do MUST include they
   do via the "replay-support" object.  In addition, a event stream that
   does support replay is not expected to have an unlimited supply of
   saved notifications available to accommodate any given replay
   request.  Subscribers MAY do a get on "replay-log-creation-time" and
   "replay-log-aged-time" to assess the availability of replay.  The
   actual size of the replay log at any given time is a publisher
   specific matter.  Control parameters for this aspect of the feature
   are outside the scope of this document.

4.2.  Modifying a Subscription

   The "modify-subscription" operation permits changing the terms of an
   existing dynamic subscription previously established on that
   transport session.  Subscriptions created by configuration operations
   cannot be modified via this RPC.  Dynamic subscriptions can be
   modified one or multiple times.  If the publisher accepts the
   requested modifications, it replies that this change has been made,
   then immediately starts sending event records based on the new terms.
   If the publisher rejects the request, the subscription remains as
   prior to the request.  That is, the request has no impact whatsoever.
   The contents of a such a rejected modification MAY include one or
   more hints on alternative input parameters and value which would have
   resulted in a successfully modified subscription.

   Dynamic subscriptions established via RPC can only be modified via
   RPC using the same transport session used to establish that
   subscription.

4.3.  Deleting a Subscription

   The "delete-subscription" operation permits canceling an existing
   subscription previously established on that transport session.  If
   the publisher accepts the request, and the publisher has indicated
   this successful reply has been sent, the publisher MUST NOT send any
   more notification messages for this subscription.  If the publisher
   rejects the request, all subscriptions remain as prior to the
   request.  That is, the request has no impact whatsoever.

   Subscriptions established via RPC can only be deleted via RPC using
   the same transport session used for subscription establishment.
   Configured subscriptions cannot be deleted using RPCs.

4.4.  Killing a Subscription

   The "kill-subscription" operation permits an operator to end a
   dynamic subscription which is not associated the transport session
   used for the RPC.  This operation MUST be secured so that only
   connections with sufficiently privileged access rights are able to
   invoke this RPC.  A publisher MUST terminate any dynamic subscription
   identified by RPC request.  An operator may find subscription
   identifiers which may be used with "kill-subscription" by searching
   for the ip address of a receiver within the yang tree.

   Configured subscriptions cannot be killed using this RPC.  Instead,
   configured subscriptions are deleted as part of regular configuration
   operations.  Publishers MUST reject any RPC attempt to kill a
   configured subscription.

5.  Configured Subscriptions

   A configured subscription is a subscription installed via a
   configuration interface.

   Configured subscriptions persist across reboots, and persist even
   when transport is unavailable.

   Configured subscriptions can be modified by any configuration client
   with write permissions for the configuration of the subscription.
   Subscriptions can be modified or terminated via the configuration
   interface at any point of their lifetime.

   Configured subscriptions are considered active as long event records
   are not being dropped due to buffer overflow.  A configured
   subscription MUST be moved to a suspended state if a buffer is
   overflowing and notification messages are being lost.  A configured
   subscription SHOULD be returned to an active state as soon as
   transport connectivity is re-established, and a receiver acknowledges
   receipt of a "subscription-resumed".

   Supporting configured subscriptions is optional and advertised using
   the "configured-subscriptions" feature.

   In addition to subscription parameters that apply to dynamic
   subscriptions, the following additional parameters apply to
   configured subscriptions:

   o  One or more receiver IP addresses (and corresponding ports)
      intended as the destination for notification messages for each
      subscription.  In addition, the transport for each destination MAY
      be defined.

   o  Optional parameters to identify an egress interface, a host IP
      address, a VRF, or an IP address plus VRF out of which
      notification messages should be pushed from the publisher.  Where
      any of this info is not explicitly included, or where just the VRF
      is provided, notification messages MUST egress the publisher's
      default interface towards that receiver.

5.1.  Creating a Configured Subscription

   Configured subscriptions are established using configuration
   operations against the top-level subtree subscription-config.  There
   are two key differences between RPCs and configuration operations for
   subscription creation.  Firstly, configuration operations install a
   subscription without question, while RPCs are designed to the support
   negotiation and rejection of requests.  Secondly, while RPCs mandate

   that the subscriber establishing the subscription is the only
   receiver of the notification messages, configuration operations
   permit specifying receivers independent of any tracked subscriber.
   Because there is no explicit association with an existing transport
   session, configuration operations require additional parameters
   beyond those of dynamic subscriptions to indicate receivers, and
   possibly whether the notification messages need to come from a
   specific egress interface on the publisher.

   After a subscription is successfully created, the publisher
   immediately sends a subscription-started state change notification to
   each receiver.  It is quite possible that upon configuration, reboot,
   or even steady-state operations, a transport session may not be
   currently available to the receiver.  In this case, when there is
   something to transport for an active subscription, transport specific
   call-home operations will be used to establish the connection.  When
   transport connectivity is available, as successful receipt of the
   subscription start change notification by a particular receiver
   indicated, notification messages may then be pushed.

   To see an example at subscription creation using configuration
   operations over NETCONF, see Appendix A of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notifications].

   Note that is possible to configure replay on a configured
   subscription.  This is to allows a configured subscription to exist
   on a system so that event records generated during boot can be
   buffered and pushed as soon as the transport session is established.

5.2.  Modifying a Configured Subscription

   Configured subscriptions can be modified using configuration
   operations against the top-level subtree subscription-config.

   Immediately after a subscription is successfully modified, the
   publisher sends to the existing receivers a state change notification
   stating the subscription has been modified (i.e., subscription-
   modified).

   If the modification involved adding and/or removing receivers, those
   modified receivers are sent state change notifications, indicating
   they have been added (i.e, subscription-started to a specific
   receiver) or removed (i.e., subscription-terminated to a specific
   receiver.)

5.3.  Deleting a Configured Subscription

   Subscriptions can be deleted using configuration operations against
   the top-level subtree subscription-config.  For example, in RESTCONF:

   DELETE /subscription-config/subscription=1922 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   Date: Sun, 24 Jul 2016 11:23:40 GMT
   Server: example-server

               Figure 3: Deleting a configured subscription

   Immediately after a subscription is successfully deleted, the
   publisher sends to all receivers of that subscription a state change
   notification stating the subscription has been terminated (i.e.,
   subscription-terminated).

6.  Deleting a Configured Subscription

   Configured subscriptions can be deleted using configuration
   operations against the top-level subtree subscription-config.

   Immediately after a subscription is successfully deleted, the
   publisher sends to the existing receivers a state change notification
   stating the subscription has been terminated (i.e., subscription-
   terminated).

7.  Asynchronous Subscribed Event Delivery

   Once a subscription has been set up, the publisher streams subscribed
   event records via notification messages per the terms of the
   subscription.  For dynamic subscriptions set up via RPC operations,
   notification messages are sent over the session used to establish the
   subscription.  For configured subscriptions, notification messages
   are sent over the specified connections.

   A notification message is sent to a receiver when something of
   interest occurs which is able to traverse all specified filtering and
   access control criteria.

   This notification message MUST be encoded as one-way notification
   element of [RFC5277], Section 4.  The following example within
   [RFC7950] section 7.16.3 is an example of a compliant message:

          <link-failure xmlns="http://acme.example.com/system">

              <if-oper-status>down</if-oper-status>
          </link-failure>
      </notification>

                 Figure 4: subscribed notification message

   This [RFC5277] section 4 one-way operation has the drawback of not
   including useful header information such as a subscription
   identifier.  When using this mechanism, it is left up to
   implementations or augmentations to this document to determine which
   event records belong to which subscription.

   These drawbacks, along with other useful common headers and the
   ability to bundle multiple event records together is being explored
   within [I.D.draft-ietf-netconf-notification-messages].  When the
   notification-messages is supported, this document will be updated to
   indicate support.

8.  Subscription State Notifications

   In addition to subscribed event records, a publisher will send
   subscription state notifications to indicate to receivers that an
   event related to the subscription management has occurred.

   Subscription state notifications are unlike other notifications which
   might be found in the event stream.  They cannot be filtered out, and
   they are delivered only to directly impacted receiver(s) of a
   subscription.  The definition of subscription state notifications is
   distinct from other notification messages by making use of a YANG
   extension tagging them as subscription state notification.

   Subscription state notifications include indications that a replay of
   event records has been completed, that a subscription is done because
   an end time has been reached, and that a subscription has started,
   been modified, been terminated, or been suspended.  They are
   described in the following subsections.

8.1.  subscription-started

   This indicates that a configured subscription has started and data
   updates are beginning to be sent.  This state change notification
   includes the parameters of the subscription, except for the

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications            October 2017


   receiver(s) addressing information and origin information indicating
   where notification messages will egress the publisher.  Note that for
   RPC-based subscriptions, no "subscription-started" notifications are
   sent.

8.2.  subscription-modified

   This indicates that a configured subscription has been modified
   successfully.  This state change notification includes the parameters
   of the subscription, except for the receiver(s) addressing
   information and origin information indicating where notification
   messages will egress the publisher.  Note that for RPC-based
   subscriptions, no "subscription-modified" state change notifications
   are sent.

8.3.  subscription-terminated

   This indicates that a subscription has been terminated by the
   publisher.  The state change notification includes the reason for the
   termination.  The publisher MAY decide to terminate a subscription
   when it is running out of resources for serving it, an internal error
   occurs, etc.  Publisher-driven terminations are notified to all
   receivers.  Northbound systems MAY also terminate configured
   subscriptions using configuration operations.

   Subscribers can terminate via RPC subscriptions established via a
   delete-subscription RPC.  In such cases, no subscription-terminated
   state change notifications are sent.  However if a kill-subscription
   RPC is sent, or some other event other than reaching the
   subscription's stop time results in the end of a subscription, then
   there MUST be this state change notification that the subscription
   has been ended.

8.4.  subscription-suspended

   This indicates that a publisher has suspended a subscription.  The
   state change notification includes the reason for the suspension.  A
   possible reason is the lack of resources to serve it.  No further
   subscribed event records will be sent until the subscription resumes.
   Suspensions are notified to the subscriber (in the case of dynamic
   subscriptions) and all receivers (in the case of configured
   subscriptions).

8.5.  subscription-resumed

   This indicates that a previously suspended subscription has been
   resumed.  Subscribed event records generated after the generation of
   this state change notification will be sent.  These state change

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications            October 2017


   notifications go to the subscriber (in the case of dynamic
   subscriptions) and all receivers (in the case of configured
   subscriptions).

8.6.  subscription-completed

   This indicates that a subscription, which includes a stop time, has
   successfully finished passing event records upon the reaching of that
   stop time.

8.7.  replay-completed

   This indicates that all of the event records prior to the current
   time have been sent.  This includes new event records generated since
   the start of the subscription.  This notification MUST NOT be sent
   for any other reason.

   If subscription contains no stop time, or has a stop time which has
   not been reached, then after the replay-completed notification has
   been sent event records will be sent in sequence as they arise
   naturally within the system.

9.  Administrative Functions

9.1.  Subscription Monitoring

   Container "subscriptions" in the YANG module below contains the state
   of all known subscriptions.  This includes subscriptions that were
   established (and have not yet been deleted) using RPCs, as well as
   subscriptions that have been configured as part of configuration.
   Using the "get" operation with NETCONF, or subscribing to this
   information via [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] allows the status of
   subscriptions to be monitored.

   Each subscription is represented as a list element.  The associated
   information includes an identifier for the subscription, receiver
   counter information, the status of the subscription, as well as the
   various subscription parameters that are in effect.  The subscription
   status indicates the subscription's state with each receiver (e.g.,
   is currently active or suspended).  Leaf "configured-subscription"
   indicates whether the subscription came into being via configuration
   or via RPC.

   Subscriptions that were established by RPC are removed from the list
   once they expire (reaching stop-time) or when they are terminated.
   Subscriptions that were established by configuration need to be
   deleted from the configuration by a configuration editing operation
   even if the stop time has been passed.

9.2.  Advertisement

   Publishers supporting this document MUST indicate support the yang
   model "ietf-subscribed-notifications" within the YANG library of the
   publisher.  In addition support for optional features: encode-xml,
   encode-json, configured-subscriptions, and replay MUST also be
   indicated if supported.

   If a publisher supports this specification but not subscriptions via
   [RFC5277], the publisher MUST NOT advertise
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0".  Even without
   this advertisement however, the publisher MUST support the one-way
   notification element of [RFC5277] Section 4.

9.3.  Event Stream Discovery

   A publisher maintains a list of available event streams as
   operational data.  This list contains both standardized and vendor-
   specific event streams.  A client can retrieve this list like any
   other YANG-defined data.

11.  Considerations

11.1.  Implementation Considerations

   For a deployment including both configured and dynamic subscriptions,
   split subscription identifiers into static and dynamic halves.  That
   way it is unlikely there will be collisions if the configured
   subscriptions attempt to set a subscription-id which might have
   already been dynamically allocated.  The lower half SHOULD be used
   for subscriptions which will have subscription identifiers provided
   from outside the publisher, and upper half for subscription
   identifiers assigned by the publisher.

   No state change notification or nor subscribed event records within
   notification messages may be sent before the transport layer,
   including any requried capabilities exchange, has been established.

   An implementation may choose to transition between active and
   suspended subscription states more frequently than required by this
   specification.  However if a subscription is unable to marshal all
   intended updates into a transmittable message in multiple successive
   intervals, the subscription SHOULD be suspended with the reason
   "unsupportable-volume".

   For configured subscriptions, operations are against the set of
   receivers using the subscription identifier as a handle for that set.
   But for streaming up dates, state change notifications are local to a
   receiver.  In this specification it is the case that receivers get no
   information from the publisher about the existence of other
   receivers.  But if an operator wants to let the receivers correlate
   results, it is useful to use the subscription identifier handle
   across the receivers to allow that correlation.

11.2.  Security Considerations

   For dynamic subscriptions the publisher MUST authenticate and
   authorize all RPC requests.

   Subscriptions could overload a publisher's CPU.  For this reason, the
   publisher MUST have the ability to decline a dynamic subscription
   request, and provide the appropriate RPC error response to a
   subscriber should the proposed subscription overly deplete the
   publisher's resources.

   A publisher needs to be able to suspend an existing dynamic or
   configured subscription based on capacity constraints.  When this
   occurs, the subscription status MUST be updated accordingly and the
   receivers notified with subscription state notifications.

   If a malicious or buggy subscriber sends an unexpectedly large number
   of RPCs, the result might be an excessive use of system resources.
   In such a situation, subscription interactions MAY be terminated by
   terminating the transport session.

   For both configured and dynamic subscriptions the publisher MUST
   authenticate and authorize a receiver via some transport level
   mechanism before sending any updates.

   A secure transport is highly recommended and the publisher MUST
   ensure that the user has sufficient authorization to perform the
   function they are requesting against the specific subset of content
   involved.

   A publisher MUST NOT include any content in a notification message
   for which the user has not been authorized.

   With configured subscriptions, one or more publishers could be used
   to overwhelm a receiver.  No notification messages SHOULD be sent to
   any receiver which doesn't even support subscriptions.  Subscribers
   that do not want notification messages need only terminate or refuse
   any transport sessions from the publisher.

   The NETCONF Authorization Control Model [RFC6536bis] SHOULD be used
   to control and restrict authorization of subscription configuration.
   This control models permits specifying per-user permissions to
   receive event records from specific streams.

   Where NACM is available, the NACM "very-secure" tag MUST be placed on
   the "kill-subscription" RPC so that only administrators have access
   to use this.

   One subscription id can be used for two or more receivers of the same
   configured subscription.  But due to the possibility of different
   access control permissions per receiver, it SHOULD NOT be assumed
   that each receiver is getting identical updates.

Appendix A.  Changes between revisions

   (To be removed by RFC editor prior to publication)

   v05 - v06

   o  Made changes proposed by Martin, Kent, and others on the list.
      Most significant of these are Stream returned to string (with the
      SYSLOG identity removed), intro section on 5277 relationship, an
      identity set moved to an enumeration, clean up of definitions/
      terminology, state machine proposed for configured subscriptions
      with a clean-up of susbcription state options.

   o  JSON and XML become features.  Also Xpath and subtree filtering
      become features

   o  Terminology updates with event records, and refinement of filters
      to just stream filters.

   o  Encoding refined in establish-subscription so it takes the RPC's
      encoding as the default.

   o  Namespaces in examples fixed.
