2. Abstract 

This is a draft of the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Certificate Management Messages Formats (CMMF).  It establishes 
harmonized message formats to be used in conjunction with security 
protocol implementations that require interaction with a Public Key 
Infrastructure (PKI).

This draft is being discussed on the "ietf-pkix" mailing list. To 
subscribe, send a message to ietf-pkix-request@tandem.com with the 
single word "subscribe" in the body of the message.

3. Introduction

This document defines message formats to be used between a PKI client 
and a PKI server or service(where a PKI is defined to encompass the 
roles of Registration Authority and Certification Authority).  Using 
these message formats, a PKI client may:
- Request public key certification
     - Responses may include CA-generated key pairs
- Request revocation of a certificate
- Receive announcements directly from a PKI on:
     - CA Key Update
     - Renewed Certificates
     - Subscriber Revocation notices
     - CRL refresh



Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 1]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

- Request data of a PKI, including:
     - OneÆs own or othersÆ certificate
     - CRL download

The specification of a transaction protocol using these message formats 
is beyond the scope of this document. It is expected that such protocols 
will be defined with a view towards localized interoperability needs.  
Where requirements exist to exchange information which is substantially 
aligned with the message content in this document, such protocols should 
reference these message formats.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase, 
as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4. Common Data Structures

Several structures are common to more than one message format.  These 
are:

- Status information
- Failure information
- Certificate identification
- Encrypted values

4.1 Status Information

Responses may include status information pertaining to a prior request.  
The following values are defined:
   
  PKIStatus ::= INTEGER { 
      granted                (0), 
      -- you got exactly what you asked for 
      grantedWithMods        (1), 
      -- you got something like what you asked for; the 
      -- requester is responsible for ascertaining the differences 
      rejection              (2), 
      -- you don't get it, more information elsewhere in the message
      waiting                (3), 
      -- the request body part has not yet been processed, 
      -- expect to hear more later 
      revocationWarning      (4), 
      -- this message contains a warning that a revocation is 
      -- imminent 
      revocationNotification (5), 
      -- notification that a revocation has occurred 
      keyUpdateWarning       (6)
      -- update already done for the oldCertId specified in 
      -- FullCertTemplate
  }





Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 2]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

4.2 Failure Information

The following values may be used to provide more information about 
failure cases. 

  PKIFailureInfo ::= BIT STRING { 
  -- since we can fail in more than one way! 
  -- More codes may be added in the future if/when required.
      badAlg           (0), 
      -- unrecognized or unsupported Algorithm Identifier
      badMessageCheck  (1), 
      -- integrity check failed (e.g., signature did not verify)
      badRequest       (2),	
      -- transaction not permitted or supported
      badTime          (3),	
      -- messageTime was not sufficiently close to the system time,
      -- as defined by local policy
      badCertId        (4), 
      -- no certificate could be found matching the provided criteria
      badDataFormat    (5),
      -- the data submitted has the wrong format
      wrongAuthority   (6),
      -- the authority indicated in the request is different from the 
      -- one creating the response token
      incorrectData    (7),
      -- the requester's data is incorrect (used for notary services)
      missingTimeStamp (8)
      -- when the timestamp is missing but should be there (by policy)
  }

  PKIStatusInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
      status        PKIStatus, 
      statusString  PKIFreeText     OPTIONAL,
      failInfo      PKIFailureInfo  OPTIONAL }

  PKIFreeText ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF UTF8String 
      -- text encoded as UTF-8 String (note:  each UTF8String SHOULD
      -- include an RFC 1766 language tag to indicate the language 
      -- of the contained text)

4.3 Certificate Identification

In order to identify particular certificates the following data 
structure is used. 

CertId ::= SEQUENCE { 
      issuer           GeneralName, 
      serialNumber     INTEGER }

4.4 Encrypted Values 

Certain values in responses may require encryption beyond that that 
which may be performed in a PKI protocol.  For example, a CA may 

Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

generate key pairs for subscribers but deliver them via an RA.As a 
general rule RAs should be prohibited from unnecessary or inadvertent 
contact with a subscriberÆs private keys.

EncryptedData ::= CHOICE {
      encryptedValue      [0] EncryptedValue,
      cMSEnveloped        [1] EnvelopedData }

The syntax of encryptedValue is defined in [CRMF].  For reference, this 
syntax is:

EncryptedValue ::= SEQUENCE { 
      intendedAlg   [0] AlgorithmIdentifier  OPTIONAL,
      -- the intended algorithm for which the value will be used
      symmAlg       [1] AlgorithmIdentifier  OPTIONAL, 
      -- the symmetric algorithm used to encrypt the value 
      encSymmKey    [2] BIT STRING           OPTIONAL,
      -- the (encrypted) symmetric key used to encrypt the value
      keyAlg        [3] AlgorithmIdentifier  OPTIONAL, 
      -- algorithm used to encrypt the symmetric key 
      valueHint     [4] OCTET STRING         OPTIONAL,
      -- a brief description or identifier of the encValue content 
      -- (may be meaningful only to the sending entity, and used only
      -- if EncryptedValue might be re-examined by the sending entity
      -- in the future)
	encValue       BIT STRING }

Use of this data structure requires that the creator and intended  
recipient respectively be able to encrypt and decrypt. Typically, this 
will mean that the sender and recipient have, or are able to generate, a 
shared secret key.

For key agreement algorithms (such as Diffie-Hellman), the encSymmKey 
field of EncryptedValue is not included.  For key exchange algorithms 
(such as RSA), the encSymmKey is a symmetric key encrypted under the 
subscriber's public key.

If the recipient of the PKIMessage already possesses a private key 
usable for decryption, then the encSymmKey field MAY contain a session
key encrypted using the recipientÆs public key.

5. Message Formats

5.1 Certification Request 

[CRMF] defines the preferred structure for production of certification 
requests.  It is a flexible mechanism designed to enable mandatory and 
optional cryptographic algorithms, centralized key generation, a variety 
of proof-of-possession options and several other control features useful 
to a robust PKI client enrollment capability.

Current industry practice can be supported for clients through use of 
the following structure.

Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

PKCSReq ::= SEQUENCE { 
    endEntityInfo    EndEntityInfo,
    regInfo          OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
    certReqId        INTEGER OPTIONAL } 

The endEntityInfo field is used to carry a public key, to prove 
possession of the public key and to provide additional ASN.1 attributes 
useful to production of the resulting certificate.

The certReqId field can be used to identify individual certification 
requests in the event multiple PKCSReqs are sent to a CA.

The regInfo field contains supplementary information related to the 
context of the certification request when such information is required 
to fulfill a certification request.  This information could include 
subscriber contact information, billing information or other
ancillary information useful to fulfillment of the certification 
request.

Current industry practice has established two structures for producing a 
signed public key. The use of explicit tagging below allows 
disambiguation among these options while maintaining bits on the wire 
compatibility with prior implementations: 

endEntityInfo :: CHOICE { 
pKCS10         CertificationRequest, 
signedKey  [0] SignedPublicKeyAndChallenge } 

SignedPublicKeyAndChallenge :: SEQUENCE { 
publicKeyAndChallenge PublicKeyAndChallenge, 
signatureAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier, 
signature BIT STRING } 

PublicKeyAndChallenge :: SEQUENCE { 
spki SubjectPublicKeyInfo, 
challenge IA5String }

CertificationRequest ::=         SEQUENCE {
  certificationRequestInfo         SEQUENCE {
    version                          INTEGER,
    subject                          Name,
    subjectPublicKeyInfo             SEQUENCE {
      algorithm                        AlgorithmIdentifier,
      subjectPublicKey                 BIT STRING }
    attributes                     [0] IMPLICIT SET OF Attribute }
  signatureAlgorithm               AlgorithmIdentifier, 
  signature                        BIT STRING }

The client MAY incorporate one or more standard X.509 v3 extensions in 
the request as an ExtensionReq attribute:

ExtensionReq ::= SEQUENCE OF Extension


Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

where Extension is imported from PKIX Part 1 and ExtensionReq is 
identified by the OID value {pkcs-9 14}.

5.2 Certification Response 

Two options are established for the response to a certification request: 
a simple form that enables basic interoperability and a form that 
enables generation of subscriber private keys by the CA.

5.2.1 Use of SignedData

[CMS] supports a degenerate case of the SignedData content type where 
there are no signers on the content. This degenerate case is used to 
convey certificate and CRL information. Certification Authorities MAY 
use this format for returning certificate information resulting from the 
successful fulfillment of a certification request. The certificate 
response MUST include the actual subject certificate corresponding to 
the information in the certification request. The response SHOULD 
include other certificates which link the issuer to higher level 
certification authorities and corresponding CRLs.

CertRep  ::= SEQUENCE {
    response    SignedData, OPTIONAL
    rspInfo     OCTET STRING }

Successful requests would include the resulting certificate(s) in the 
response field along with any additional {name, value} information 
useful to client-side processing of a successful request.  In the event 
of an unsuccessful request, the rspInfo field contains information 
regarding the failure which may be useful to the requesting entity.

RspInfo content MAY include state information the PKI client needs such 
as the contents of the regInfo in the CRMF ( see [CRMF]). Other 
additional data could include detailed error information that uniquely 
identifies an information field supplied in the original regInfo; e.g. 
the Zip Code was incorrect for the specified address or locale or 
billing failed because credit card information was in error.

5.2.2 CertRepContent

A CertRepContent data structure contains a CA public key, a status value 
and optionally failure information, a subject certificate, and an 
encrypted private key.

  CertRepContent ::= SEQUENCE {
      caPubs    [1] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Certificate OPTIONAL,
      response  SEQUENCE of CertResponse }

  CertResponse ::= SEQUENCE { 
      certReqId           INTEGER,
      -- to match this response with corresponding request (a value
      -- of -1 is to be used if certReqId is not specified in the
      -- corresponding request)

Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

      status              PKIStatusInfo, 
      certifiedKeyPair    CertifiedKeyPair,   OPTIONAL }

  CertifiedKeyPair ::= SEQUENCE { 
      certOrEncCert       CertOrEncCert,
      privateKey      [0] EncryptedValue      OPTIONAL,
      publicationInfo [1] PKIPublicationInfo  OPTIONAL }

  CertOrEncCert ::= CHOICE {
      certificate     [0] Certificate,
      encryptedCert   [1] EncryptedValue }

Given an EncryptedCert and the relevant decryption key the certificate 
may be obtained. The purpose of this is to allow a CA to return the 
value of a certificate, but with the constraint that only the intended 
recipient can obtain the actual certificate. The benefit of this 
approach is that a CA may reply with a certificate even in the absence 
of a proof that the requester is the end entity which can use the 
relevant private key (note that the proof is not obtained until 
confirmation of receipt is received by the CA). Thus the CA will not 
have to revoke that certificate in the event that something goes wrong 
with the proof of possession.

5.3 GetCertInitial

The GetCertInitial message is used to poll for the certificate 
associated with prior request if the response to that prior request was 
a CertRep message with a status of PENDING.

Certificates are normally referenced using the CA DN and the certificate 
serial number.  In this case however a certificate has not yet been 
issued.  Thus the CA and Subject DNs are present in the message as a 
means to identify the requested certification.  The certReqId field, if 
used, contains a value that matches a corresponding value in a prior 
certification request in the event multiple requests have been sent to a 
CA and those requests contained a certReqId value.

IssuerAndSubject ::= SEQUENCE {
   issuer      Name,
   subject     Name,
   certReqId   INTEGER OPTIONAL }

5.4 GetCRL

This operation is used to retrieve CRLs from a certificate server or 
serviceÆs repository. This message is useful in circumstances where a 
fully-deployed Directory is either infeasible or undesired.

The GetCRL message body consists of the following syntax:





Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

GetCRL ::= SEQUENCE {
    issuerName	Name,
    cRLName       GeneralName, OPTIONAL
    time          GeneralizedTime, OPTIONAL
    reasons       ReasonFlags OPTIONAL }

The Name component is the value of the Issuer DN in the subject certifi-
cate. The cRLName component may be the value of CRLDistributionPoints in 
the subject certificate or equivalent value in the event the certificate 
does not contain such a value.  The time component is used by the client 
to specify from among potentially several issues of CRL that one whose 
thisUpdate value is less than but nearest to the specified time.  In the 
absence of a time component, the CA always returns with the most recent 
CRL.  The reasonFlags field can be used to specify from among CRLs 
partitioned by revocation reason.  Implementors should bear in mind that 
while a specific revocation request has a single CRLReason code--and 
consequently entries in the CRL would have a single CRLReason code 
value--a single CRL can aggregate information for one or more 
reasonFlags.

5.5 Revocation Request

Two options are established to enable programmatic submission of a 
revocation request.

5.5.1 RevRequest

RevRequests ::= SEQUENCE OF RevRequest

RevRequest ::= SEQUENCE {
    issuerName	Name,
    serialNumber  INTEGER,
    reason        CRLReason,
    passphrase    OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
    comment       UTF8string OPTIONAL }

For a revocation request to become a reliable object in the event of a 
dispute, a strong proof of originator authenticity is required. A 
Registration AuthorityÆs digital signature on the request can provide 
this proof for certificates within the scope of the RAÆs revocation 
authority. However, in the instance when an end-entity has lost use of 
their signature private key, it is impossible to produce a reliable 
digital signature. [CRMF] provides for the use specification of a 
passphrase during enrollment which may be used as an alternative 
authenticator in the instance of loss of use. The acceptability of this 
practice is a matter of local security policy.

5.5.2 RevReqContent

When requesting revocation of a certificate (or several certificates) 
the following data structure is used.



Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

RevReqContent ::= SEQUENCE OF RevDetails

  RevDetails ::= SEQUENCE { 
      certDetails         CertTemplate, 
      -- allows requester to specify as much as they can about 
      -- the cert. for which revocation is requested 
      -- (e.g., for cases in which serialNumber is not available)
      revocationReason    ReasonFlags, 
      -- from the Draft Amendment (DAM), so CA knows what to use in 
      -- Distribution point
      badSinceDate        GeneralizedTime  OPTIONAL, 
      -- indicates best knowledge of sender 
      crlEntryDetails     Extensions 
      -- requested crlEntryExtensions }

5.6 Revocation Response

The response to the RevReqContent message. If produced, this is sent to 
the  requester of the revocation. (A separate revocation announcement 
message  MAY be sent to the subject of the certificate for which 
revocation was requested.) 

  RevRepContent ::= SEQUENCE { 
      status        SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF PKIStatusInfo, 
      -- in same order as was sent in RevReqContent
      revCerts  [0] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF CertId OPTIONAL, 
      -- IDs for which revocation was requested (same order as status)
      crls      [1] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF CertificateList  OPTIONAL 
      -- the resulting CRLs (there may be more than one) }

5.7 Challenge-Response Proof Of Possession

[CRMF] establishes the basis for a challenge-response proof of 
possession technique.  The challenge-response messages for proof of 
possession of a private decryption key are specified as follows (see 
[MvOV97, p.404], for  details).

  POPODecKeyChallContent ::= SEQUENCE OF Challenge
  -- One Challenge per encryption key certification request (in the 
  -- same order as these requests appear in FullCertTemplates). 

  Challenge ::= SEQUENCE {
      owf                 AlgorithmIdentifier  OPTIONAL,
      -- MUST be present in the first Challenge; MAY be omitted in any 
      -- subsequent Challenge in POPODecKeyChallContent (if omitted, 
      -- then the owf used in the immediately preceding Challenge is 
      -- to be used).
      witness             OCTET STRING,
      -- the result of applying the one-way function (owf) to a 
      -- randomly-generated INTEGER, A.  [Note that a different
      -- INTEGER MUST be used for each Challenge.]



Myers, Adams                                                    [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

challenge           OCTET STRING
      -- the encryption (under the public key for which the cert. 
      -- request is being made) of Rand, where Rand is specified as 
      --   Rand ::= SEQUENCE { 
      --      int      INTEGER, 
      --       - the randomly-generated INTEGER A (above)
      --      sender   GeneralName 
      --       - the sender's name 
      --   }
  }

  POPODecKeyRespContent ::= SEQUENCE OF INTEGER
  -- One INTEGER per encryption key certification request (in the 
  -- same order as these requests appear in CertReqMessages).  The
  -- retrieved INTEGER A (above) is returned to the sender of the
  -- corresponding Challenge.

It is recognized that, in general, there is a security risk associated 
with the decryption of arbitrary data (that is, it is typically not 
recommended that an entity decrypts arbitrary received ciphertext and 
returns the corresponding, random-looking plaintext).  This is because 
obtaining the plaintext for carefully-chosen "ciphertexts" may in some 
cases leak information or provide the challenger with signatures on 
documents that the receiver had no intention of signing.

The witness parameter in the above challenge precludes such attacks 
because it convincingly demonstrates to the receiver that the challenger 
knew the plaintext that corresponds to each of the ciphertext challenges 
prior to the exchange.  Therefore, in a strict information-theoretic
sense, the challenger learns no information whatsoever other than the 
fact that the receiver is in possession of the private key corresponding 
to the public key for which certification is requested (which is what 
this protocol is explicitly designed to show).  Furthermore, the 
challenger is not in possession of any data (e.g., a signature on a 
document) after the exchange that it did not already possess prior to 
the exchange.

5.8 PKI Confirmation content 

This data structure is used in three-way protocols as the final 
PKIMessage. Its content is the same in all cases - actually there is no 
content since the PKIHeader carries all the required information. 

  PKIConfirmContent ::= NULL

5.9 Announcements

>From time to time a PKI may need to distribute information to its 
clients or subscribers.  These messages are generally unsolicited and 
and may be received by end entities at random times.  Implementers of 
protocols that use these message formats should take this effect into 
account.


Myers, Adams                                                   [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

5.9.1 CA Key Update Announcement content 

When a CA updates its own key pair the following data structure MAY be 
used to announce this event.

  CAKeyUpdAnnContent ::= SEQUENCE { 
      oldWithNew          Certificate, -- old pub signed with new priv 
      newWithOld          Certificate, -- new pub signed with old priv 
      newWithNew          Certificate  -- new pub signed with new priv 
  }

To change the key of the CA, the CA does the following: 


  1.Generate a new key pair; 

  2.Create a certificate containing the old CA public key signed with 
    the new private key (the "old with new" certificate); 

  3.Create a certificate containing the new CA public key signed with 
    the old private key (the "new with old" certificate); 

  4.Create a certificate containing the new CA public key signed with 
    the new private key (the "new with new" certificate); 

  5.Publish these new certificates via the directory and/or other means 

  6.Export the new CA public key so that end entities may acquire it 
    using the "out-of-band" mechanism (if required). 

The old CA private key is then no longer required. The old CA public key 
will however remain in use for some time. The time when the old CA 
public key is no longer required (other than for non-repudiation) will 
be when all end entities of this CA have securely acquired the new CA  
public key. 

The "old with new" certificate must have a validity period starting at 
the generation time of the old key pair and ending at the expiry date of 
the old public key. 

The "new with old" certificate must have a validity period starting at 
the generation time of the new key pair and ending at the time by which 
all end entities of this CA will securely possess the new CA public key
(at the latest, the expiry date of the old public key). 

The "new with new" certificate must have a validity period starting at 
the generation time of the new key pair and ending at the time by which 
the CA will next update its key pair. 

5.9.2 Certificate Announcement

This structure MAY be used to announce the existence of certificates. 


Myers, Adams                                                   [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

Note that this message is intended to be used for those cases (if any)
where there is no pre-existing method for publication of certificates; 
it is not intended to be used where, for example, X.500 is the 
method for publication of certificates. 

  CertAnnContent ::= Certificate

5.9.3 CRL Announcement

When a CA issues a new CRL (or set of CRLs) the following data structure 
MAY be used to announce this event. 

  CRLAnnContent ::= SEQUENCE OF CertificateList 

5.9.4 Revocation Announcement

When a CA has revoked, or is about to revoke, a particular certificate 
it MAY issue an announcement of this (possibly upcoming) event. 

  RevAnnContent ::= SEQUENCE { 
      status              PKIStatus, 
      certId              CertId, 
      willBeRevokedAt     GeneralizedTime, 
      badSinceDate        GeneralizedTime, 
      crlDetails          Extensions  OPTIONAL 
      -- extra CRL details(e.g., crl number, reason, location, etc.) 
  }

A CA MAY use such an announcement to warn (or notify) a subject that its 
certificate is about to be (or has been) revoked. This would typically 
be used where the request for revocation did not come from the subject 
concerned.

The willBeRevokedAt field contains the time at which a new entry will be 
added to the relevant CRLs.

5.10 Key recovery Response

For key recovery responses the following syntax is used.  For some 
status values (e.g., waiting) none of the optional fields will be 
present.

  KeyRecRepContent ::= SEQUENCE { 
      status          PKIStatusInfo,
      newSigCert  [0] Certificate                   OPTIONAL, 
      caCerts     [1] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF 
                                   Certificate      OPTIONAL,
      keyPairHist [2] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF 
                                   CertifiedKeyPair OPTIONAL
  }

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

5.11 PKI General Message content

>From time to time a PKI MAY announce other information not explicitly 
called out in this specification.  In such cases the following structure 
MAY be used to unambiguously identify this information when transmitted 
as a PKI message.

InfoTypeAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      infoType               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
      infoValue              ANY DEFINED BY infoType  OPTIONAL
  }
   -- This construct MAY also be used to define new PKIX Certificate
  -- Management Protocol request and response messages, or general-
  -- purpose (e.g., announcement) messages for future needs or for 
  -- specific environments.
  GenMsgContent ::= SEQUENCE OF InfoTypeAndValue
  -- May be sent by EE, RA, or CA (depending on message content).
  -- The OPTIONAL infoValue parameter of InfoTypeAndValue will typically
  -- be omitted for some of the examples given above.  The receiver is 
  -- free to ignore any contained OBJ. IDs that it does not recognize.
  -- If sent from EE to CA, the empty set indicates that the CA may send 
  -- any/all information that it wishes.

5.12 PKI General Response content

GenRepContent ::= SEQUENCE OF InfoTypeAndValue
  -- The receiver is free to ignore any contained OBJ. IDs that it does 
  -- not recognize.

5.13 Error Message

  ErrorMsgContent ::= SEQUENCE {
      pKIStatusInfo          PKIStatusInfo,
      errorCode              INTEGER           OPTIONAL,
      -- implementation-specific error codes
      errorDetails           PKIFreeText       OPTIONAL
      -- implementation-specific error details
  }

6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 

This entire memo is about security mechanisms. 

One cryptographic consideration is worth explicitly spelling out. In 
the protocols specified above, when an end entity is required to 
prove possession of a decryption key, it is effectively challenged 
to decrypt something (its own certificate). This scheme (and many 
others!) could be vulnerable to an attack if the possessor of the 
decryption key in question could be fooled into decrypting an 
arbitrary challenge and returning the cleartext to an attacker. 
Although in this specification a number of other failures in 
security are required in order for this attack to succeed, it is 
conceivable that some future services (e.g., notary, trusted time) 

Myers, Adams                                                   [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             February 1998

could potentially be vulnerable to such attacks. For this reason we 
re-iterate the general rule that implementations should be very 
careful about decrypting arbitrary "ciphertext" and revealing 
recovered "plaintext" since such a practice can lead to serious 
security vulnerabilities.
