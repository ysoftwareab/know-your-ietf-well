1.  Introduction

Within the Architecture for describing Internet Management Frameworks
[RFC3411], the User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] for SNMPv3 is
defined as a Security Subsystem within an SNMP engine. RFC 3414
describes the use of HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96 as the initial
authentication protocols and the use of CBC-DES as the initial privacy
protocol. The User-based Security Model, however, allows for other such
protocols to be used instead of or concurrently with these protocols.

This memo describes the use of CFB128-AES-128 as an alternative privacy
protocol for the User-based Security Model.  The key words "MUST", "MUST
NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  Goals and Constraints

The main goal of this memo is to provide a new privacy protocol for the
USM based on the Advanced Encryption Standard.

The major constraint is to maintain a complete interchangeability of the
new protocol defined in this memo with existing authentication and
privacy protocols already defined in USM.

For a given user, the AES-based privacy protocol MUST be used with one
of the authentication protocols defined in RFC 3414 or an
algorithm/protocol providing equivalent functionality.

1.2.  Key Localization

As defined in [RFC3414], a localized key is a secret key shared between
a user U and one authoritative SNMP engine E. Even though a user may
have only one pair of authentication and privacy passwords (and
consequently only one pair of keys) for the whole network, the actual
secrets shared between the user and each authoritative SNMP engine will
be different. This is achieved by key localization.

If the authentication protocol defined for a user U at the authoritative
SNMP engine E is one of the authentication protocols defined in
[RFC3414], the key localization is performed according to the two-step
process described in section 2.6 of [RFC3414].

1.3.  Password Entropy and Storage

The security of various cryptographic functions lies both in the
strength of the functions themselves against various forms of attack,
and also, perhaps more importantly, in the keying material that is used
with them.  While theoretical attacks against the cryptographic
functions specified by this document are possible, it is vastly more
probable that key guessing is the main threat.

The following can be suggested with regard to the user password:

   - Passwords length SHOULD be at least 12 octets.
   - Password sharing SHOULD be prohibited so that passwords aren't
     shared among multiple SNMP users.
   - Implementations SHOULD support the use of randomly generated
     passwords as a stronger form of security.

It is worth remembering that, as specified in [RFC3414], if a user's
password or a non-localized key is disclosed, then key localization will
not help and network security may be compromised. Therefore a user's
password or non-localized key MUST NOT be stored on a managed
device/node. Instead the localized key SHALL be stored (if at all), so
that, in case a device does get compromised, no other managed or
managing devices get compromised.

3.  CFB128-AES-128 Symmetric Encryption Protocol

This section describes a Symmetric Encryption Protocol based on the AES
cipher algorithm [FIPS-AES], used in Cipher Feedback Mode as described
in [AES-MODE], using encryption keys with a size of 128 bits.

This protocol is identified by usmAesCfb128PrivProtocol.

The protocol usmAesCfb128PrivProtocol is an alternative to the privacy
protocol defined in [RFC3414].

3.1.  Mechanisms

- In support of data confidentiality, an encryption algorithm is
required. An appropriate portion of the message is encrypted prior to
being transmitted. The User-based Security Model specifies that the
scopedPDU is the portion of the message that needs to be encrypted.

- A secret value is shared by all SNMP engines which can legitimately
originate messages on behalf of the appropriate user.  This secret value
in combination with a timeliness value and a 64-bit integer is used to
create the (localized) en/decryption key and the initialization vector.

3.1.1.  The AES-based Symmetric Encryption Protocol

The Symmetric Encryption Protocol defined in this memo provides support
for data confidentiality. The designated portion of an SNMP message is
encrypted and included as part of the message sent to the recipient.

The AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the symmetric cipher algorithm
that the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) has
selected in a four-year competitive process as Replacement for DES (Data
Encryption Standard).

The AES homepage, http://www.nist.gov/aes, contains a wealth of
information on AES including the Federal Information Processing Standard
[FIPS-AES] that fully specifies the Advanced Encryption Standard.

The following subsections contain descriptions of the relevant
characteristics of the AES ciphers used in the symmetric encryption
protocol described in this memo.

3.1.1.1.  Mode of operation

The NIST Special Publication 800-38A [AES-MODE] recommends five
confidentiality modes of operation for use with AES: Electronic Codebook
(ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output
Feedback (OFB), and Counter (CTR).

The symmetric encryption protocol described in this memo uses AES in CFB
mode with the parameter S (number of bits fed back) set to 128 according
to the definition of CFB mode given in [AES-MODE]. This mode requires an
Initialization Vector (IV) that is the same size as the block size of
the cipher algorithm.

3.1.1.2.  Key Size

In the encryption protocol described by this memo AES is used with a key
size of 128 bits, as recommended in [AES-MODE].

3.1.1.3.  Block Size and Padding

The block size of the AES cipher algorithms used in the encryption
protocol described by this memo is 128 bits, as recommended in [AES-
MODE].

3.1.1.4.  Rounds

This parameter determines how many times a block is encrypted. The
encryption protocol described in this memo uses 10 rounds, as
recommended in [AES-MODE].

3.1.2.  Localized Key, AES Encryption Key and Initialization Vector

The size of the Localized Key (Kul) of an SNMP user, as described in
[RFC3414], depends on the authentication protocol defined for that user
U at the authoritative SNMP engine E.

The encryption protocol defined in this memo MUST be used with an
authentication protocol that generates a localized key with at least 128
bits. The authentication protocols described in [RFC3414] satisfy this
requirement.

3.1.2.1.  AES Encryption Key and IV

The first 128 bits of the localized key Kul are used as the AES
encryption key.  The 128-bit IV is obtained as the concatenation of the

authoritative SNMP engine's 32-bit snmpEngineBoots, the SNMP engine's
32-bit snmpEngineTime, and a local 64-bit integer. The 64-bit integer is
initialized to a pseudo-random value at boot time.

The IV is concatenated as follows: the 32-bit snmpEngineBoots is
converted to the first 4 octets (Most Significant Byte first), the
32-bit snmpEngineTime is converted to the subsequent 4 octets (Most
Significant Byte first), and the 64-bit integer is then converted to the
last 8 octets (Most Significant Byte first).  The 64-bit integer is then
put into the msgPrivacyParameters field encoded as an OCTET STRING of
length 8 octets. The integer is then modified for the subsequent
message. We recommend that it is incremented by one until it reaches its
maximum value at which time it is wrapped.

An implementation can use any method to vary the value of the local
64-bit integer providing the chosen method never generates a duplicate
IV for the same key.

A duplicated IV can result in the very unlikely event that multiple
managers, communicating with a single authoritative engine, both
accidentally select the same 64-bit integer within a second. The
probability of such an event is very low, and doesn't affect
significantly the robustness of the mechanisms proposed.

The 64-bit integer must be placed in the privParameters field to enable
the receiving entity to compute the correct IV and to decrypt the
message. This 64-bit value is called the "salt" in this document.

Note that the sender and receiver must use the same IV value, i.e., they
must both use the same values of the individual components used to
create the IV.  In particular, both sender and receiver must use the
values of snmpEngineBoots, snmpEngineTime and the 64-bit integer which
are contained in the relevant message (in the
msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots, msgAuthoritativeEngineTime and
privParameters fields respectively).

3.1.3.  Data Encryption

The data to be encrypted is treated as a sequence of octets.

The data is encrypted in Cipher Feedback mode with the parameter s set
to 128 according to the definition of CFB mode given in Section 6.3 of
[AES-MODE]. A clear diagram of the encryption and decryption process is
given in Figure 3 of [AES-MODE].

Internet Draft             AES for SNMP's USM             September 2003


The plaintext is divided into 128-bit blocks. The last block may have
fewer than 128 bits, and no padding is required.

The first input block is the IV, and the forward cipher operation is
applied to the IV to produce the first output block. The first
ciphertext block is produced by exclusive-ORing the first plaintext
block with the first output block. The ciphertext block is also used as
the input block for the subsequent forward cipher operation.

The process is repeated with the successive input blocks until a
ciphertext segment is produced from every plaintext segment.

The last ciphertext block is produced by exclusive-ORing the last
plaintext segment of r bits (r is less than or equal to 128) with the
segment of the r most significant bits of the last output block.

3.1.4.  Data Decryption

In CFB decryption, the IV is the first input block, the first ciphertext
is used for the second input block, the second ciphertext is used for
the third input block, etc. The forward cipher function is applied to
each input block to produce the output blocks. The output blocks are
exclusive-ORed with the corresponding ciphertext blocks to recover the
plaintext blocks.

The last ciphertext block (whose size r is less than or equal to 128) is
exclusive-ORed with the segment of the r most significant bits of the
last output block to recover the last plaintext block of r bits.

3.2.  Elements of the AES Privacy Protocol

This section contains definitions required to realize the privacy
modules defined by this memo.

3.2.1.  Users

Data en/decryption using this Symmetric Encryption Protocol makes use of
a defined set of userNames. For any user on whose behalf a message must
be en/decrypted at a particular SNMP engine, that SNMP engine must have
knowledge of that user.  An SNMP engine that needs to communicate with
another SNMP engine must also have knowledge of a user known to that
SNMP engine, including knowledge of the applicable attributes of that
user.

Internet Draft             AES for SNMP's USM             September 2003


A user and its attributes are defined as follows:

   <userName>
     An octet string representing the name of the user.

   <privAlg>
     The algorithm used to protect messages generated on behalf of the
     user from disclosure.

   <privKey>
     The user's secret key to be used as input to the generation of the
     localized key for encrypting/decrypting messages generated on
     behalf of the user.  The length of this key MUST be greater than or
     equal to 128 bits (16 octets).

   <authAlg>
     The algorithm used to authenticate messages generated on behalf of
     the user, which is also used to generate the localized version of
     the secret key.

3.2.2.  msgAuthoritativeEngineID

The msgAuthoritativeEngineID value contained in an authenticated message
specifies the authoritative SNMP engine for that particular message (see
the definition of SnmpEngineID in the SNMP Architecture document
[RFC3411]).

The user's (private) privacy key is different at each authoritative SNMP
engine and so the snmpEngineID is used to select the proper key for the
en/decryption process.

3.2.3.  SNMP Messages Using this Privacy Protocol

Messages using this privacy protocol carry a msgPrivacyParameters field
as part of the msgSecurityParameters. For this protocol, the
privParameters field is the serialized OCTET STRING representing the
"salt" that was used to create the IV.

3.2.4.  Services provided by the AES Privacy Modules

This section describes the inputs and outputs that the AES Privacy
module expects and produces when the User-based Security module invokes
one of the AES Privacy modules for services.

3.2.4.1.  Services for Encrypting Outgoing Data

The AES privacy protocol assumes that the selection of the privKey is
done by the caller, and that the caller passes the localized secret key
to be used.

Upon completion the privacy module returns statusInformation and, if the
encryption process was successful, the encryptedPDU and the
msgPrivacyParameters encoded as an OCTET STRING.  The abstract service
primitive is:

statusInformation =              -- success or failure
  encryptData(
  IN    encryptKey               -- secret key for encryption
  IN    dataToEncrypt            -- data to encrypt (scopedPDU)
  OUT   encryptedData            -- encrypted data (encryptedPDU)
  OUT   privParameters           -- filled in by service provider
        )

The abstract data elements are:

  statusInformation
    An indication of the success or failure of the encryption
    process. In case of failure, it is an indication of the error.
  encryptKey
    The secret key to be used by the encryption algorithm.
    The length of this key MUST be 16 octets.
  dataToEncrypt
    The data that must be encrypted.
  encryptedData
    The encrypted data upon successful completion.
  privParameters
    The privParameters encoded as an OCTET STRING.

3.2.4.2.  Services for Decrypting Incoming Data

This AES privacy protocol assumes that the selection of the privKey is
done by the caller and that the caller passes the localized secret key
to be used.

Upon completion the privacy module returns statusInformation and, if the
decryption process was successful, the scopedPDU in plain text. The
abstract service primitive is:

3.3.  Elements of Procedure

This section describes the procedures for the AES privacy protocol for
SNMP's User-based Security Model.

3.3.1.  Processing an Outgoing Message

This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine whenever
it must encrypt part of an outgoing message using the
usmAesCfb128PrivProtocol.

  1) The secret encryptKey is used to construct the AES encryption key,
     as described in section 3.1.2.1.

  2) The privParameters field is set to the serialization according to
     the rules in [RFC3417] of an OCTET STRING representing the 64-bit
     integer that will be used in the IV as described in section
     3.1.2.1.

  3) The scopedPDU is encrypted (as described in section 3.1.3) and the
     encrypted data is serialized according to the rules in [RFC3417] as
     an OCTET STRING.

  4) The serialized OCTET STRING representing the encrypted scopedPDU
     together with the privParameters and statusInformation indicating
     success is returned to the calling module.

3.3.2.  Processing an Incoming Message

This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine whenever
it must decrypt part of an incoming message using the
usmAesCfb128PrivProtocol.

  1) If the privParameters field is not an 8-octet OCTET STRING, then an
     error indication (decryptionError) is returned to the calling
     module.

  2) The 64-bit integer is extracted from the privParameters field.

  3) The secret decryptKey and the 64-bit integer are then used to
     construct the AES decryption key and the IV that is computed as
     described in section 3.1.2.1.

  4) The encryptedPDU is then decrypted (as described in section 3.1.4).

  5) If the encryptedPDU cannot be decrypted, then an error indication
     (decryptionError) is returned to the calling module.

  6) The decrypted scopedPDU and statusInformation indicating success
     are returned to the calling module.

4.  Security Considerations

The security of the cryptographic functions defined in this document
lies both in the strength of the functions themselves against various
forms of attack, and also, perhaps more importantly, in the keying
material that is used with them.  The recommendations done in Section
1.3 MUST be followed to ensure maximum entropy to the selected
passwords, and to protect the passwords while stored.

For information regarding the necessary use of random IV values, see
[CRYPTO-B].

This algorithm MUST be used with one of the authentication protocols
defined in RFC 3414  or an algorithm/protocol providing equivalent
functionality (including integrity), because CFB encryption mode does
not detect ciphertext modifications.

For further security considerations, the reader is encouraged to read
[RFC3414], and the documents that describe the actual cipher algorithms.

5.  Intellectual Property Rights Statement

The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain
to the implementation or use of the technology described in this
document or the extent to which any license under such rights might or
might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any
effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the IETF's
procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and standards
related documentation can be found in BCP-11. Copies of claims of rights
made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made
available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license
or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or
users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary rights,
which may cover technology that may be required to practice this
standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
Director.

6.  IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to assign an OID for the snmpUsmAesMIB module under
the snmpModules subtree, maintained in the registry at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers. The suggested value is 20.
IANA is requested to assign an OID for the usmAesCfb128Protocol under
the snmpPrivProtocols registration point, as defined in RFC 3411
[RFC3411]. The suggested value is 4.

7.  Acknowledgements
