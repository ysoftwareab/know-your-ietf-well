Abstract

   This document defines a bidirectional protocol mapping for the
   exchange of instant messages in the context of a one-to-one chat
   session between a user of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and a
   user of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).
   Specifically for SIP text chat, this document specifies a mapping to
   the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP).

1.  Introduction

   Both the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] and the
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120] can be
   used for the purpose of one-to-one text chat over the Internet.  To
   ensure interworking between these technologies, it is important to
   define bidirectional protocol mappings.

   The architectural assumptions underlying such protocol mappings are
   provided in [RFC7247], including mapping of addresses and error
   conditions.  This document specifies mappings for one-to-one text
   chat sessions (sometimes called "session-mode" messaging); in
   particular, this document specifies mappings between XMPP messages of
   type "chat" and the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975],
   which is commonly used in SIP-based systems for chat functionality
   (although note that MSRP is not conjoined to SIP, and can be used by
   non-SIP technologies).  Mappings for single instant messages and
   groupchat are provided in separate documents.

   The approach taken here is to directly map syntax and semantics from
   one protocol to another.  The mapping described herein depends on the
   protocols defined in the following specifications:

   o  XMPP chat sessions using message stanzas of type "chat" are
      specified in [RFC6121].

   o  MSRP chat sessions using the SIP INVITE and SEND request types are
      specified in [RFC4975].

   In SIP-based systems that use MSRP, a chat session is formally
   negotiated (just as any other session type is negotiated when using
   SIP).  By contrast, a one-to-one chat "session" in XMPP is an
   informal construct and is not formally negotiated: a user simply
   sends a message of type "chat" to a contact, the contact then replies
   to the message, and the sum total of such messages exchanged during a
   defined period of time is considered to be a chat session (ideally
   tied together using an XMPP <thread/> element as described in
   Section 5.1 of [RFC6121]).  To overcome the disparity between these
   approaches, a gateway that wishes to map between SIP/MSRP and XMPP
   for one-to-one chat sessions needs to maintain some additional state,
   as described below.

2.  Intended Audience

   The documents in this series are intended for use by software
   developers who have an existing system based on one of these
   technologies (e.g., SIP), and would like to enable communication from
   that existing system to systems based on the other technology (e.g.,
   XMPP).  We assume that readers are familiar with the core
   specifications for both SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP [RFC6120], with the
   base document for this series [RFC7247], and with the following chat-
   related specifications:

   o  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975]

   o  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol: Instant Messaging and
      Presence [RFC6121]

   o  Indication of Message Composition for Instant Messaging [RFC3994]

   o  Chat State Notifications [XEP-0085]

   Note well that not all protocol-compliant messages are shown (such as
   SIP 100 TRYING messages), in order to focus the reader on the
   essential aspects of the protocol flows.

3.  Terminology

   A number of terms used here are explained in [RFC3261], [RFC4975],
   [RFC6120], and [RFC6121].

   In flow diagrams, SIP/MSRP traffic is shown using arrows such as
   "***>" whereas XMPP traffic is shown using arrows such as "...>".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  XMPP to MSRP

   In XMPP, the "informal session" approach is to simply send someone a
   <message/> of type "chat" without starting any session negotiation
   ahead of time (as described in [RFC6121]).  The XMPP "informal
   session" approach maps very well into a SIP MESSAGE request, as
   described in [RFC7247].  However, the XMPP informal session approach
   can also be mapped to MSRP if the XMPP-to-SIP gateway maintains
   additional state.  The order of events is as follows.

   XMPP            XMPP        XMPP-to-MSRP        SIP             SIP

                  Figure 1: XMPP to MSRP Order of Events

   The mapping of XMPP syntax to SIP syntax MUST be as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-stox-im].

   First the XMPP user would generate an XMPP chat message.

   Example 1: Juliet sends XMPP message (F1)

   | <message from='juliet@example.com/yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym'
   |          to='romeo@example.net'
   |          id='a786hjs2'
   |          type='chat'>
   |   <thread>29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50</thread>
   |   <body>Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</body>
   | </message>

   Upon receiving such a message stanza, the XMPP server needs to
   determine the identity of the domainpart in the 'to' address, which
   it does by following the procedures explained in Section 5 of
   [RFC7247].  If the domain is a SIP domain, the XMPP server will hand
   off the message stanza to an XMPP-to-SIP gateway or connection
   manager that natively communicates with MSRP-aware SIP servers.

   The XMPP-to-SIP gateway at the XMPP server would then initiate an
   MSRP session with Romeo on Juliet's behalf (since there is no
   reliable way for the gateway to determine whether Romeo's client
   supports MSRP, if that is not the case then MSRP session initiation
   might result in an error).

Internet-Draft         SIP-XMPP Interworking: Chat            March 2015


   Example 2: Gateway starts SIP session on behalf of Juliet (F3)

   | INVITE sip:romeo@example.net SIP/2.0
   | To: <sip:romeo@example.net>
   | From: <sip:juliet@example.com>
   | Contact: <sip:juliet@example.com>;gr=yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym
   | Subject: Open chat with Juliet?
   | Call-ID: 29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50
   | CSeq: 1 INVITE
   | Content-Type: application/sdp
   |
   | c=IN IP4 x2s.example.com
   | m=message 7654 TCP/MSRP *
   | a=accept-types:text/plain
   | a=path:msrp://x2s.example.com:7654/jshA7weztas;tcp

   Here we assume that Romeo's client supports MSRP and that Romeo
   accepts the MSRP session request.

   Example 3: Romeo accepts session request (F5)

   | SIP/2.0 200 OK
   | From: <sip:juliet@example.com>
   | To: <sip:romeo@example.net>
   | Contact: <sip:romeo@example.net>;gr=dr4hcr0st3lup4c
   | Call-ID: 29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50
   | CSeq: 1 INVITE
   | Content-Type: application/sdp
   |
   | c=IN IP4 s2x.example.net
   | m=message 12763 TCP/MSRP *
   | a=accept-types:text/plain
   | a=path:msrp://s2x.example.net:12763/kjhd37s2s20w2a;tcp

   The XMPP-to-SIP gateway then acknowledges the session acceptance on
   behalf of Juliet.

   Example 4: Gateway sends ACK to Romeo (F7)

   | ACK sip:juliet@example.com SIP/2.0
   | To: <sip:romeo@example.net>;gr=dr4hcr0st3lup4c
   | From: <sip:juliet@example.com>
   | Contact: <sip:juliet@example.com>;gr=yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym
   | Call-ID: 29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50
   | CSeq: 2 ACK

   The XMPP-to-SIP gateway then transforms the original XMPP chat
   message into MSRP.

Internet-Draft         SIP-XMPP Interworking: Chat            March 2015


   Example 5: Gateway maps XMPP message to MSRP (F9)

   | MSRP a786hjs2 SEND
   | From-Path: msrp://x2s.example.com:7654/jshA7weztas;tcp
   | To-Path: msrp://s2x.example.net:12763/kjhd37s2s20w2a;tcp
   | Message-ID: 54C6F4F1-A39C-47D6-8718-FA65B3D0414A
   | Byte-Range: 1-25/25
   | Content-Type: text/plain
   |
   | Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
   | -------a786hjs2$

   Romeo can then send a reply using his MSRP client.

   Example 6: Romeo sends reply (F10)

   | MSRP di2fs53v SEND
   | To-Path: msrp://x2s.example.com:7654/jshA7weztas;tcp
   | From-Path: msrp://s2x.example.net:12763/kjhd37s2s20w2a;tcp
   | Message-ID: 6480C096-937A-46E7-BF9D-1353706B60AA
   | Byte-Range: 1-25/25
   | Failure-Report: no
   | Content-Type: text/plain
   |
   | Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
   | -------di2fs53v$

   The SIP-to-XMPP gateway would then transform that message into
   appropriate XMPP syntax for routing to the intended recipient.

   Example 7: Gateway maps MSRP message to XMPP (F11)

   | <message from='romeo@example.net/dr4hcr0st3lup4c'
   |          to='juliet@example.com/yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym'
   |          id='di2fs53v'
   |          type='chat'>
   |   <thread>29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50</thread>
   |   <body>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</body>
   | </message>

   When the MSRP user wishes to end the chat session, the user's MSRP
   client sends a SIP BYE.

   Example 8: Romeo terminates chat session (F13)

   | CSeq: 3 BYE

   The BYE is then acknowledged by the XMPP-to-SIP gateway.

   Example 9: Gateway acknowledges termination (F15)

   Because there is no formal session on the XMPP side, there is no
   corresponding communication from the gateway to the XMPP user.
   However, it is reasonable for the gateway to send a "gone" chat state
   notification [XEP-0085], as described under Section 6.1.

   In addition, there is no explicit method defined in [RFC6121] for an
   XMPP user to formally terminate a chat session, so a gateway would
   need to listen for a "gone" chat state notification from the XMPP
   user or institute a timer that considers the XMPP informal chat
   session to be ended after some amount of time has elapsed ([XEP-0085]
   suggests generating a "gone" chat state if a user has not interacted
   with the chat session interface, system, or device for a relatively
   long period of time, e.g., 10 minutes).

5.  MSRP to XMPP

   When an MSRP client sends messages through a gateway to an XMPP
   client, the order of events is as follows.

   SIP             SIP         MSRP-to-XMPP       XMPP            XMPP

   The protocol flow begins when Romeo starts a chat session with
   Juliet.

   Example 10: Romeo starts chat session (F17)

   | INVITE sip:juliet@example.com SIP/2.0
   | From: <sip:romeo@example.net>
   | To: <sip:juliet@example.com>
   | Contact: <sip:romeo@example.net>;gr=dr4hcr0st3lup4c
   | Subject: Open chat with Romeo?

   | m=message 7313 TCP/MSRP *
   | a=accept-types:text/plain
   | a=path:msrp://s2x.example.net:7313/ansp71weztas;tcp

   Upon receiving the INVITE, the SIP (MSRP) server needs to determine
   the identity of the domain portion of the Request-URI or To header,
   which it does by following the procedures explained in Section 5 of
   [RFC7247].  If the domain is an XMPP domain, the SIP server will hand
   off the INVITE to an associated MSRP-to-XMPP gateway or connection
   manager that natively communicates with XMPP servers.

   Example 11: Gateway accepts session on Juliet's behalf (F19)

6.  Composing Events

   Both XMPP and MSRP enable a client to receive notifications when a
   person's conversation partner is composing an instant message within
   the context of a chat session.

   For XMPP, the Chat State Notifications specification [XEP-0085]
   defines five states: active, inactive, gone, composing, and paused.
   Some of these states are related to the act of message composition
   (composing, paused), whereas others are related to the sender's
   involvement with the chat session (active, inactive, gone).  Note
   that the "gone" chat state is not to be confused with the <gone/>
   stanza error condition defined in [RFC6120].

Internet-Draft         SIP-XMPP Interworking: Chat            March 2015


   For MSRP (and SIP/SIMPLE in general), the Indication of Message
   Composition for Instant Messaging specification [RFC3994] defines two
   states: idle and active.  Here the idle state indicates that the
   sender is not actively composing a message, and the active state
   indicates that the sender is indeed actively composing a message (the
   sending client simply toggles between the two states).

   Because the XEP-0085 states can represent information that is not
   captured in RFC 3994, gateways can either (a) map only the composing-
   related states or (b) map all the XEP-0085 states.

   The following mappings are suggested.

   Table 3: Mapping of SIP/SIMPLE isComposing events to XMPP chat states

   +-------------------+--------------------+
   | isComposing Event |  Chat State        |
   +-------------------+--------------------+
   | active            |  composing         |
   | idle              |  active            |
   +-------------------+--------------------+

   Table 4: Mapping of XMPP chat states to SIP/SIMPLE isComposing events

   +-------------------+--------------------+
   | Chat State        | isComposing Event  |
   +-------------------+--------------------+
   | active            |  idle              |
   | inactive          |  idle              |
   | gone              |  [none, see S.6.1]  |
   | composing         |  active            |
   | paused            |  idle              |
   +-------------------+--------------------+

   The XMPP Chat State Notifications specification [XEP-0085] allows the
   sending of "standalone notifications" outside the context of a
   message, theoretically even before any messages are exchanged;
   although a gateway could thus send an <active/> notification to the
   XMPP user when the SIP user accepts or initiates a chat session
   (i.e., after F6 in Section 4 or after F22 in Section 5), this usage
   might be unexpected by XMPP clients as a way to signal the beginning
   of an informal chat session.

6.1.  Use of the Gone Chat State

   Although there is no direct mapping for the "gone" chat state to an
   isComposing event, receipt of the "gone" state at an XMPP-to-MSRP
   gateway can serve as a trigger for terminating the formal chat

   session within MSRP, i.e., for sending a SIP BYE for the session from
   the XMPP-to-MSRP gateway to the SIP user.  The following examples
   illustrate this indirect mapping (which would occur after step F14 in
   Figure 1).

   Example 19: Juliet sends gone chat state

   | <message from='juliet@example.com'
   |          id='nx62f197'
   |          to='romeo@example.net'
   |          type='chat'>
   |   <thread>29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50</thread>
   |   <gone xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/chatstates'/>
   | </message>

   Example 20: XMPP-to-MSRP gateway maps gone chat state to SIP BYE

   | BYE romeo@example.net sip: SIP/2.0
   | From: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=786
   | To: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=087js
   | Call-ID: 29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50
   | CSeq: 3 BYE
   | Content-Length: 0

   Similarly, receipt of a SIP BYE message at an MSRP-to-XMPP gateway
   can serve as a trigger for sending a "gone" chat state notification
   to the XMPP user.  The following examples illustrate this indirect
   mapping (which would occur after step F30 in Figure 2).

   Example 21: Romeo terminates chat session

   | BYE juliet@example.com sip: SIP/2.0
   | To: <sip:juliet@example.com>;gr=yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym
   | From: <sip:romeo@example.net>

   | CSeq: 3 BYE
   | Content-Length: 0

   Example 22: MSRP-to-XMPP gateway generates gone chat state

   | <message from='romeo@example.net'
   |          id='hs61v397'
   |          to='juliet@example.com'
   |          type='chat'>
   |   <thread>F6989A8C-DE8A-4E21-8E07-F0898304796F</thread>
   |   <gone xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/chatstates'/>

   To enable these uses, gateways that support chat state notifications
   MUST support the "gone" state (which is merely recommended, not
   required, by [XEP-0085]).

   It is also reasonable for gateways to implement timers that
   automatically trigger a "gone" chat state if the XMPP user has not
   sent a message within the "session" for a given amount of time
   ([XEP-0085] suggests generating a "gone" chat state if a user has not
   interacted with the chat session interface, system, or device for a
   relatively long period of time, e.g., 10 minutes).

7.  Delivery Reports

   Both XMPP and MSRP enable a client to receive notifications when a
   message has been received by the intended recipient.

   For XMPP, the Message Receipts specification [XEP-0184] defines a
   method and XML namespace for requesting and returning indications
   that a message has been received by a client controlled by the
   intended recipient.

   For MSRP, a native reporting feature is included, in the form of
   REPORT chunks (see Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 of [RFC4975]).

   An XMPP Message Receipts element of <request
   xmlns='urn:xmpp:receipts'/> is to be mapped to an MSRP Success-Report
   header field with a value of "yes", and an XMPP Message Receipts
   element of <received xmlns='urn:xmpp:receipts'/> is to be mapped to
   an MSRP REPORT request.

   A Success-Report header field with a value of "yes" in an MSRP SEND
   request is to be mapped to an XMPP Message Receipts element of
   <request xmlns='urn:xmpp:receipts'/>, and an MSRP REPORT request is
   to be mapped to an XMPP message containing only a Message Receipts
   element of <received xmlns='urn:xmpp:receipts'/>.

   Because the XMPP Message Receipts specification does not support
   failure reports, there is no mapping for the MSRP Failure-Report
   header field and gateways SHOULD set that header field to "no".

   Examples follow.

   First, the XMPP user sends a message containing a request for
   delivery notification.

Internet-Draft         SIP-XMPP Interworking: Chat            March 2015


   Example 23: Juliet sends XMPP message with receipt request

   | <message from='juliet@example.com'
   |          id='bf9m36d5'
   |          to='romeo@example.net'
   |          type='chat'>
   |   <thread>29377446-0CBB-4296-8958-590D79094C50</thread>
   |   <body>What man art thou ...?</body>
   |   <request xmlns='urn:xmpp:receipts'/>
   | </message>

   Example 24: Gateway maps XMPP message to MSRP

   | MSRP bf9m36d5 SEND
   | To-Path: msrp://s2x.example.net:7313/jshA7weztas;tcp
   | From-Path: msrp://x2s.example.com:8763/lkjh37s2s20w2a;tcp
   | Message-ID: 6187CF9B-317A-41DA-BB6A-5E48A9C794EF
   | Byte-Range: 1-25/25
   | Success-Report: yes
   | Failure-Report: no
   | Content-Type: text/plain
   |
   | What man art thou ...?
   | -------bf9m36d5$

   Next, the recipient returns a report.

   Example 25: Romeo returns MSRP receipt

   | MSRP hx74g336 REPORT
   | To-Path: msrp://x2s.example.com:8763/lkjh37s2s20w2a;tcp
   | From-Path: msrp://s2x.example.net:7313/jshA7weztas;tcp
   | Message-ID: 6187CF9B-317A-41DA-BB6A-5E48A9C794EF
   | Byte-Range: 1-106/106
   | Status: 000 200 OK
   | -------hx74g336$

   Example 26: MSRP-to-XMPP gateway maps receipt to XMPP

   | <message from='romeo@example.net'
   |          id='hx74g336'
   |          to='juliet@example.com'>
   |   <received xmlns='urn:xmpp:receipts' id='87652491'/>
   | </message>

8.  Message Size

   Unlike page-mode messaging [RFC3428] (which specifies that the size
   of a MESSAGE request is not allowed to exceed 1300 bytes), session-
   mode messaging [RFC4975] can be used to send larger messages.  MSRP
   includes a chunking mechanism such that larger messages can be broken
   up into multiple MSRP SEND requests.  Because the MSRP gateway at an
   XMPP service acts as an MSRP endpoint, it is responsible for
   receiving chunked messages and reconstructing them into a single
   message for delivery toward the XMPP recipient.  (Naturally,
   implementations need to be careful about accepting very large
   messages; see Section 14.5 of [RFC4975].)

   Although there is no hard limit on the size of an XMPP stanza, in
   practice most XMPP services (at least on the public Internet) are
   configured with a maximum stanza size in order to help prevent denial
   of service attacks.  As specified in Section 13.12 of [RFC6120], this
   maximum is not allowed to be less than 10,000 bytes.

   The administrators of an XMPP service need to ensure that the
   associated MSRP gateway is configured with the same or smaller
   maximum MSRP message size as the maximum XMPP stanza size; this
   enables the gateway to return an appropriate value for the SDP "max-
   size" attribute (see Section 8.6 of [RFC4975]) and to properly handle
   incoming messages larger than the configured limits.

   If an MSRP-to-XMPP gateway implementation receives an MSRP message
   that exceeds its configured limit as just described, it MUST return
   an MSRP 413 error (e.g., in response to the first SEND request whose
   Byte-Range header field indicates a byte total exceeding the limit).

9.  Internationalization Considerations

   Relevant discussion of internationalized text in messages can be
   found in [I-D.ietf-stox-im].

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no actions of IANA.

11.  Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for instant messaging protocols are
   given in [RFC2779], for MSRP chat in [RFC4975] (see also [RFC3261]
   when SIP is used to negotiate MSRP sessions), and for XMPP-based
   instant messaging in [RFC6121] (see also [RFC6120]).  The security
   considerations provided in [RFC7247] also apply.
