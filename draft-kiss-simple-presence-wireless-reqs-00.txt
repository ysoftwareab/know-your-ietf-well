  1. Abstract 
      
     This Internet-Draft defines requirements for Presence Service based 
     on 3GPP specifications and wireless environment characteristics. The 
     requirements presented in this document are proposed to be evaluated 
     by the SIMPLE Working Group. The result of this evaluation process 
     could help to determine the work expected to be done in IETF and 
     identify the work which might be done in other standardization

  Krisztian Kiss          3GPP Presence Requirements          June 2002 
   
      
     This Internet-Draft defines requirements for Presence Service based 
     on  3GPP specifications [6][7] and other needs rising from 
     mobile/wireless environment characteristics. Presence Service is 
     referenced as defined in IMPP Working Group in documents [10] and 
     [11].  
      
     The document assumes the usage of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
     [8] for subscriptions and notifications of user presence [12] as  
     defined in the SIMPLE Working Group. Additionally, some other 
     existing Working Group and/or individual drafts are used as a 
     baseline. These include the SIP Event Template-Package for Watcher 
     Information documents [16][17], the SIMPLE components draft [15], 
     the SIP buddylist event package [14] and the content indirection 
     requirements draft [18]. 
      
     The document also assumes the usage of the Common Presence and 
     Instant Messaging (CPIM) Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) 
     defined in [13] as the default presence document data format, 
     however some of the requirements presented here might require 
     extensions to PIDF.  
      
     The requirements presented in this document are proposed to be 
     evaluated by the SIMPLE Working Group. The result of this evaluation 
     process would help to determine the work expected to be done in IETF 
     and identify the work which might be done in other standardization 
     bodies, such as 3GPP. Thus, a more precise work-share between 
     standardization bodies could be worked out. The overall goal of 
     these requirements is to allow the development of a fully 
     standardized presence application for wireless terminals, utilizing 
     existing IETF and 3GPP specifications.   
      
      
  5. General wireless requirements 
      
     The radio interface is a scarce resource. As such, the number and 
     size of the messages exchanged over the radio interface between the 
     UA and the network should be minimized. All the mechanisms developed 
     should make an efficient use of the radio interface. 
      
     As terminals could be rather small devices, memory requirements, 
     power consumption, processing power, etc. should be kept to a 
     minimum. Mandating support for additional protocols and mechanisms 
     in the terminal must meet this requirement. 
      
      
  6. Publishing requirements 
      
  6.1 Standardized mechanism to update (publish) presence information 
      


                                                                          
  Internet-Draft           Expires: December 6, 2002              Page 3 
  Krisztian Kiss          3GPP Presence Requirements          June 2002 
   
     There must be a standardized mechanism to update (publish) the 
     presence information. The mechanism must allow publishing from 
     multiple Presence User Agents (PUAs) of a single presentity. 
      
     There must be rules and mechanisms to merge the information from 
     multiple sources and resolve possible conflicts, and to keep all the 
     publishing PUAs aware of each other's published information. 
      
  6.2 Publishing efficiency 
      
     The preferred mechanism for updating the presence information would 
     allow the Presence User Agent to update only parts of the presence 
     information. For example if a piece of presence information changes, 
     only that part needs to be updated, as opposed to always sending the 
     full state within each publish transaction. This would allow more 
     efficient utilization of the network resources. 
      
     See also the related requirements in section 5. 
      
      
  7. Subscription and notification requirements 
      
  7.1 Filtering 
      
     It must be possible for a subscriber to request what presence 
     information he wants to receive in future notifications.  
      
     EXAMPLE: the subscriber may only want to be notified when the 
     presentity becomes available for conferencing. 
      
     The Presence Agent must be able to construct presence information 
     that is delivered to subscriber according to authorization rules and 
     subscriber∆s filtering request. 
   
  7.2 Anonymous subscription 
      
     It must be possible for the subscriber to request an anonymous 
     subscription (i.e. the subscriber∆s identifier will not be revealed 
     to the presentity).  
      
     This anonymous request may be accepted or rejected, depending on the 
     presentity∆s access control settings, as described in Chapter 9.  
      
     NOTE: This requirement may be met with the overall privacy solution 
     for SIP. 
      
  7.3 Efficient subscription and notification 
      
     The preferred mechanism would allow the Presence Agent to generate 
     partial notifications containing only those attributes, which have 
     changed value compared to the previous notification.

  Krisztian Kiss          3GPP Presence Requirements          June 2002 
   
     The mechanism would also allow the subscriber to indicate support 
     for partial notification when subscribing to the presentity∆s 
     presence information. 
      
     Another identified way to decrease the number of SUBSCRIBE and 
     NOTIFY messages is to use a solution similar to the SIP event 
     package for buddylist subscriptions described in [19]. 
      
     A third identified solution is to use some dynamic compression 
     mechanisms to compress the presence information. 
      
     See the related requirements in section 5. 
      
  7.4 Content indirection 
      
     Content indirection is described in [18]. In connection to presence 
     the following requirements have been identified: 
      
     The Presence Agent must be able to perform content indirection. 
     Subscribers must have the capability to indicate the support of 
     content indirection. The Presence Agent must honor subscriber∆s 
     preferences whether to perform content indirection or not when it 
     detects a situation where content indirection should be performed. 
      
      
  8. Requirements for the content of the Presence Document 
      
     It must be possible for the Presence Document to contain multiple 
     types of presence attributes. As an example, one type could be user 
     specific attribute, another type device specific attribute and a 
     third type network specific attribute.  
      
  8.1 Presence attributes 
      
     It must be possible for the Presence Document to identify the type 
     of presence attribute and must provide unique identity for all 
     presence attributes. 
      
     It must be possible to have multiple instances of the semantically 
     same attributes for different purposes/subscribers. 
      
     EXAMPLE: One group of subscribers is shown a different value for the 
     status of presentity than the other. 
      
  8.2 Location information 
      
     There must be a standardized mechanism to express location 
     information and related privacy restrictions within the Presence 
     Document. This location information may be transported either in a 
     standardized way or by a 3GPP specific extension to the standardized 
     Presence Document.

  9. Authorization requirements 
      
     This chapter defines the requirements for how presentity is able to 
     authorize the presence subscriptions. 
      
  9.1 Standardized setting of authorization policy 
      
     There must be a standardized mechanism for the presentity (Presence 
     User Agent) to set the authorization policy related to his own 
     presence information. 
      
     This means that the authorization policy document format and a set 
     of manipulation operations upon that format must be standardized. 
     Such manipulation operations should be aligned with the ones used 
     for other similar purposes. 
      
     It should be possible for network operators to extend the format of 
     the authorization policy document and the operations upon that 
     format based on local policy. 
   
  9.2 Expressiveness of authorization rules 
      
     It must be possible to define different "access rights" or "views" 
     for different subscribers or groups of subscribers. The access 
     rights determine what parts of the presence information are provided 
     to a particular subscriber.  
      
     EXAMPLE: Only subscribers belonging to a particular group are 
     allowed to receive information related to presentity's location. 
      
     It must be possible for the presentity to grant access rights 
     separately for all elements of the presence information. 
      
     It must be possible for the presentity to grant access rights 
     separately on the level of detail of the presence information.  
      
     It must be possible to grant access rights with an expiry time to a 
     particular subscriber or group. 
      
     As groups are seen as an important concept in the authorization 
     policy definition, it is expected that the standardized mechanisms 
     related to authorization policy management include operations for 
     management of groups. The solution should be aligned with the group 
     management operations used for other purposes.  
      
      
  10. Watcher information requirements 
      
  10.1 Watcher information filtering

  Krisztian Kiss          3GPP Presence Requirements          June 2002 
   
     It should be possible for the presentity to monitor the watcher 
     status of certain subscribers.  
      
     This requirement may be fulfilled if the watcher information 
     subpackage defined in [16] could be extended with filtering 
     mechanisms. 
      
  10.2 Watcher history 
      
     It must be possible for the presentity to fetch the list of the 
     subscribers who have accessed (by subscription or fetch) his 
     presence information during a well-defined time-period (e.g. last 7 
     days). 
      
     Additionally to the list of subscribers, the details of the presence 
     information provided to different subscribers should be available 
     for the presentity when fetching the watcher history. 
      
      
  11. Evaluation against the SIMPLE charter items 
   
     SIMPLE Working Group charter may contain solution space for some of 
     the requirements presented in this document. This chapter will 
     present a proposal how these requirements could be mapped into 
     SIMPLE Working Group work items. 
      
  11.1 Publishing requirements 
   
     New SIMPLE charter has a work item for user∆s buddylist management 
     and authorization operations. This work item could be used to define 
     generic approach how user∆s presence service related information 
     could be managed. 
      
  11.2 Subscription and notification requirements 
   
     The most appropriate place to implement all subscription and 
     notification related requirements is the SIMPLE Working Group, as 
     SIP based presence extensions have been specified in this Working 
     Group. At the moment there is no appropriate work item for these 
     requirements.   
      
  11.3 Presence Document requirements 
   
     New SIMPLE charter has a work item for SIMPLE PIDF profile. Scope of 
     this work item could be defined to include presence document 
     requirements presented in this document. 
      
  11.4 Authorization requirements 
   
     New SIPMLE charter has a work item for user∆s buddylist management 
     and authorization operations. This work item could be used to 
     implement authorization requirements presented in this document.

  11.5 Watcher information requirements 
   
     Watcher information format and event-template has been specified in 
     SIMPLE Working Group. It would be beneficial if this group∆s 
     expertise could be utilized to generate required extensions to 
     support watcher information filtering and history information.  
   
   
  12. Proposed next steps 
      
     It is proposed that SIMPLE Working Group should evaluate these 
     requirements. The requirements for which a consensus is found within 
     the Working Group should be incorporated into the presence 
     requirements Working Group draft. It is also expected for the 
     Working Group to point out any requirements that fall out of its 
     scope, so that other standardization bodies, such as 3GPP are able 
     to start working on those without the risk of overlapping work. The 
     results of such work can be brought back to IETF as Informational 
     documents.
