Abstract

  This document describes how an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
  session is mapped onto a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  connection.  This mapping requires use of the Transport Layer Security
  (TLS) protocol to protect information exchanged between an EPP client
  and an EPP server.

1. Introduction

  This document describes how the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
  is mapped onto a single client-server TCP connection.  Security
  services beyond those defined in EPP are provided by the Transport
  Layer Security (TLS) Protocol [RFC2246].  EPP is described in [EPP].
  TCP is described in [RFC793].

  This document is being discussed on the "ietf-provreg" mailing list.
  To join the list, send a message to <majordomo@cafax.se> with the
  words "subscribe ietf-provreg" in the body of the message.  There is a
  web site for the list archives at http://www.cafax.se/ietf-provreg.

2. Session Management

  Mapping EPP session management facilities onto the TCP service is
  straight forward.  An EPP session first requires creation of a TCP
  connection between two peers, one that initiates the connection
  request and one that responds to the connection request.  The
  initiating peer is called the "client", and the responding peer is
  called the "server".  An EPP server MUST listen for TCP connection
  requests on a standard TCP port assigned by IANA.

  The client MUST issue an active OPEN call, specifying the TCP port
  number on which the server is listening for EPP connection attempts.
  The server MUST respond with a passive OPEN call, which the client
  MUST acknowledge to establish the connection.  The EPP server MUST
  return an EPP <greeting> to the client after the TCP session has been
  established.

  An EPP session is normally ended by the client issuing an EPP <logout>
  command.  A server receiving an EPP <logout> command MUST end the EPP
  session and close the TCP connection through an active CLOSE call.
  The client MUST respond with a passive CLOSE call.

  A client MAY end an EPP session by issuing an active CLOSE call.  A
  server SHOULD respond with a passive CLOSE call.

  A server MAY limit the life span of an established TCP connection.
  EPP sessions that are inactive for more than a server-defined period
  MAY be ended by a server issuing an active CLOSE call.  A server MAY
  also close TCP connections that have been open and active for longer
  than a server-defined period.

  Peers SHOULD respond to an active CLOSE call with a passive CLOSE
  call.  The closing peer MAY issue an ABORT call if the responding peer
  does not respond to the active CLOSE call.

3. Message Exchange

  With the exception of the EPP server greeting, EPP messages are
  initiated by the EPP client in the form of EPP commands.  An EPP
  server MUST return an EPP response to an EPP command on the same TCP
  connection that carried the command.  If the TCP connection is closed
  after a server receives and successfully processes a command but
  before the response can be returned to the client, the server MAY
  attempt to undo the effects of the command to ensure a consistent
  state between the client and the server.  EPP commands are idempotent,
  so processing a command more than once produces the same net effect on
  the repository as successfully processing the command once.

  An EPP client streams EPP commands to an EPP server on an established
  TCP connection.  A client MAY establish multiple TCP connections to
  create multiple command exchange channels.  A server MAY limit a
  client to a maximum number of TCP connections based on server
  capabilities and operational load.

  EPP describes client-server interaction as a command-response exchange
  where the client sends one command to the server and the server
  returns one response to the client.  A client might be able to realize
  a slight performance gain by pipelining (sending more than one command
  before a response for the first command is received) commands with TCP
  transport, but this feature does not change the basic single command,
  single response operating mode of the core protocol.  The amount of
  data that can be outstanding is limited to the current TCP window
  size.

  Each EPP data unit MUST contain a single EPP message.  Commands MUST
  be processed independently and in the same order as sent from the
  client.

  A server SHOULD impose a limit on the amount of time required for a
  client to issue a well-formed EPP command.  A server SHOULD end an EPP
  session and close an open TCP connection if a well-formed command is
  not received within the time limit.

  A general state machine for an EPP server is described in section 2 of
  [EPP].  General client-server message exchange using TCP transport is
  illustrated in Figure 1.

4. Data Unit Format

  The data field of the TCP header MUST contain an EPP data unit.  The
  EPP data unit contains two fields: a 32-bit header that describes the
  total length of the data unit, and the EPP XML instance.

  EPP Data Unit Format (one tick mark represents one bit position):

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                           Total Length                        |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                         EPP XML Instance                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+//-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  Total Length (32 bits): The total length of the EPP data unit measured
  in octets in network (big endian) byte order.  The octets contained in
  this field MUST be included in the total length calculation.

  EPP XML Instance (variable length): The EPP XML instance carried in
  the data unit.

5. Transport Considerations

  Section 2.1 of the EPP core protocol specification [EPP] describes
  considerations to be addressed by protocol transport mappings.  This
  mapping addresses each of the considerations using a combination of
  features described in this document and features provided by TCP as
  follows:

  - TCP includes features to provide reliability, flow control, ordered
  delivery, and congestion control.  Section 1.5 of RFC 793 [RFC793]
  describes these features in detail.  TCP is a connection-oriented
  protocol, and Section 2 of this mapping describes how EPP sessions are
  mapped to TCP connections.

  - Sections 2 and 3 of this mapping describe how the stateful nature of
  EPP is preserved through managed sessions and controlled message
  exchanges.

  - Section 3 of this mapping notes that command pipelining is possible
  with TCP, though batch-oriented processing (combining multiple EPP
  commands in a single data unit) is not permitted.

  - Section 4 of this mapping describes features to frame data units by
  explicitly specifying the number of octets used to represent a data
  unit.

6. Internationalization Considerations

  This mapping does not introduce or present any internationalization or
  localization issues.

7. IANA Considerations

  Mapping EPP onto TCP requires a TCP port assignment from IANA for
  public operation.  TCP port 3121 (a port number in the user port
  range) has been assigned by IANA for development and test purposes.  A
  system port will need to be assigned, and this user port assignment
  will need to be reclaimed, if this document advances to RFC status.

  System Port number XXX - TBA by IANA.

8. Security Considerations

  EPP as-is provides only simple client authentication services using
  identifiers and plain text passwords.  A passive attack is sufficient
  to recover client identifiers and passwords, allowing trivial command
  forgery.  Protection against most other common attacks MUST be
  provided by other layered protocols.

  EPP provides protection against replay attacks through command
  idempotency.  A replayed or repeated command will not change the state
  of any object in any way, though denial of service through consumption
  of connection resources is a possibility.

  When layered over TCP, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol
  described in [RFC2246] MUST be used to prevent eavesdropping,
  tampering, and command forgery attacks.  Implementations of TLS often
  contain a US-exportable cryptographic mode that SHOULD NOT be used to
  protect EPP.  Clients and servers desiring high security SHOULD
  instead use TLS with cryptographic algorithms that are less
  susceptible to compromise.

  Mutual client and server authentication using the TLS Handshake
  Protocol is REQUIRED.  EPP service MUST NOT be granted until
  successful completion of a TLS handshake, ensuring that both client
  and server have been authenticated and cryptographic protections are
  in place.

  EPP TCP servers are vulnerable to common TCP denial of service attacks
  including TCP SYN flooding.  Servers SHOULD take steps to minimize the
  impact of a denial of service attack using combinations of easily
  implemented solutions, such as deployment of firewall technology and
  border router filters to restrict inbound server access to known,
  trusted clients.

  Replaced "nominal" with "normal" in the text.

  Reword section 3 to eliminate confusing description of "asynchronous"
  operation and added client-server message exchange diagram.

  Changed use of "datagram" to "header" or "data unit" as appropriate.

  Added text to note that the length field octets in the EPP data unit
  are carried in network byte order.

  Added new section 5 and renumbered.
