     Location Source Parameter for the SIP Geolocation Header Field
                     draft-ietf-sipcore-locparam-06

Abstract

   There are some circumstances where a Geolocation header field may
   contain more than one locationValue.  Knowing the identity of the
   node adding the locationValue allows the recipient more freedom in
   selecting the value to look at first rather than relying solely on
   the order of the locationValues.  This document defines the "loc-src"
   parameter so that the entity adding the locationValue to Geolocation
   header field can identify itself using its hostname.  This document
   updates RFC 6442.

Internet-Draft             Location Parameter              February 2020


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Geolocation specification [RFC6442] describes the
   "Geolocation" SIP header field which is used to indicate that the SIP
   message is conveying location information.  [RFC6442] specifies that
   SIP intermediaries should not add locationValues to a SIP request
   that already contains locationValue.  [RFC6442] also states that if a
   SIP intermediary adds location it is fully responsible for addressing
   the concerns of any 424 (Bad Location Information) SIP response it
   receives.  However, some communications architectures, such as 3GPP
   [TS23-167] and ETSI [M493], prefer to use information provided by
   edge proxies or acquired through the use of core-network nodes,
   before using information provided solely by user equipment (UE).
   These solutions don't preclude the use of UE-provided location but
   require a means of being able to distinguish the identity of the node
   adding the locationValue to the SIP message from that provided by the
   UE.

   [RFC6442] stipulates that the order of locationValues in the
   Geolocation header field is the same as the order in which they were
   added to the header field.  Whilst this order provides guidance to
   the recipient as to which values were added to the message earlier in
   the communication chain, it does not identify which node added the
   locationValue.  Knowing the identity of the entity that added the
   location to the message allows the recipient to choose which location
   to consider first rather than relying solely on the order of the
   locationValues in the Geolocation header field.

   This document extends the Geolocation header field of [RFC6442], by
   allowing an entity adding the locationValue to identify itself using
   a hostname.  This is done by defining a new geoloc-param header field
   parameter, "loc-src".  How the entity adding the locationValue to the
   header field obtains the location information is out of scope of this
   document.  Please note that the "loc-src" parameter field does not
   alter the subject of the locationValue.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Rationale

   The primary intent of the "loc-src" parameter in this specification
   is for use in emergency calling.  There are various architectures
   defined for providing emergency calling using SIP-based messaging.
   Each has its own characteristics with corresponding pros and cons.
   All of them allow the UE to provide location information; however,
   many also attach other sources of location information to support
   veracity checks, provide backup information, or to be used as the
   primary location.

   This document does not comment on these various architectures or on
   the rationale for including multiple locationValues.  It does
   recognize that these architectures exist and that there is a need to
   identify the entity adding the location information.

   The "loc-src" parameter adds the location source generating the
   locationValue to allow recipients to make informed decisions about
   which of multiple values to use.

   The "loc-src" parameter is applicable within a single private
   administrative domain or between different administrative domains
   where there is a trust relationship between the domains.  Thus it is
   intended to use this parameter only in trust domains where Spec(T) as
   described in [RFC3325] exists.

   The "loc-src" parameter is not included in a SIP message sent to
   another network if there is no trust relationship.  The "loc-src"
   parameter is not applicable if the administrative domain manages
   emergency calls in a way that does not require any generation of the
   location.

   The functional architecture to support emergency caller location
   described within ETSI [M493] is an example of an architecture where
   it makes sense to use this parameter.

4.  Mechanism

   The mechanism adds a geoloc-param parameter to the locationValue
   defined in [RFC6442] that identifies the hostname of the entity
   adding the locationValue to the Geolocation header field.  The
   Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234] for this parameter is shown in
   Figure 1.

Internet-Draft             Location Parameter              February 2020


          location-source = "loc-src" EQUAL hostname
          hostname = <defined in RFC3261>




                         Figure 1: Location Source

   Only a fully qualified host name is valid.  The syntax does not
   support IP addresses, and if an entity conforming to this
   specification receives a Geolocation header field with a "loc-src"
   parameter containing an IP address, it MUST remove the parameter.

   A SIP intermediary conformant to this specification adding a
   locationValue to a Geolocation header field SHOULD also add a "loc-
   src" header field parameter so that it is clearly identified as the
   node adding the location.  A User Agent (UA) MUST NOT insert a "loc-
   src" header field parameter.  If a SIP intermediary receives a
   message from an untrusted source with the "loc-src" parameter set
   then it MUST remove the "loc-src" parameter before passing the
   message into a trusted network.

5.  Example

   The following example shows a SIP INVITE message containing a
   Geolocation header field with two locationValues.  The first
   locationValue points to a PIDF-LO in the SIP body using a content-
   indirection (cid:) URI per [RFC4483] and this is provided by the UE.
   The second locationValue is an https URI provided by a SIP
   intermediary which identifies itself using the "loc-src" parameter.

      INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TLS pc33.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK74bf9

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document doesn't change any of the privacy considerations
   described in [RFC6442].  While the addition of the "loc-src"
   parameter identifies the entity that added the location in the
   signaling path, this addition provides little more exposure than
   adding a proxy identity to the Record-Route header field (privacy
   defined in [RFC3323]).

7.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces the ability of a SIP intermediary to insert
   a host name indicating that they added the specific locationValue to
   the Geolocation header field.  The intent is for this field to be
   used by the location recipient in the event that the SIP message
   contains multiple locationValues.  As a consequence this parameter
   should only be used by the location recipient in a trusted network.
   Adding this parameter in an untrusted network serves solely to give
   location information to untrusted parties, and is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   As already stated in [RFC6442], securing the location hop-by-hop,
   using TLS, protects the message from eavesdropping and modification
   in transit, but exposes the information to all SIP intermediaries on
   the path as well as the endpoint.  The "loc-src" parameter is
   applicable within a single private administrative domain or between
   different administrative domains where there is a relationship
   between the domains.  If such trust relationship is not given, it is
   strongly recommended to delete the location information.

   The use of this parameter is not restricted to a specific
   architecture but using multiple locations and loc-src may end in
   compatibility issues.  [RFC6442] already addresses the issue of
   multiple locations.  To avoid problems of a possible corruption of
   the location information including the "loc-src" parameter when using
   a untrusted relationship, it is strongly recommended to delete
   location information when passed to another domain out of the trust
   domain.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of loc-src parameter for Geolocation header field

   The IANA is asked to add a new SIP header field parameter for the
   Geolocation header field in the "Header Field Parameters and
   Parameter Values" subregistry (created by [RFC3968]) of the "Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters" registry found at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/.
