INTERNET-DRAFT                              Additional XML Security URIs


1. Introduction

   XML Digital Signatures, Canonicalization, and Encryption have been
   standardized by the W3C and by the joint IETF/W3C XMLDSIG working
   group [W3C]. All of these are now W3C Recommendations and IETF
   Informational or Standards Track documents.  They are available as
   follows:

   IETF level           W3C REC     Topic
   -----------          -------     -----
   [RFC 3275] Draft Std [XMLDSIG]   XML Digital Signatures
   [RFC 3076] Info      [CANON]     Canonical XML
    - - - - - -         [XMLENC]    XML Encryption
   [RFC 3741] Info      [EXCANON]   Exclusive XML Canonicalization

   All of these standards and recommendations use URIs [RFC 2396] to
   identify algorithms and keying information types.  This document is a
   convenient reference list of URIs and descriptions for algorithms in
   which there is substantial interest but which can not or have not
   been included in the main documents for some reason.  Note in
   particular that raising XML digital signature to Draft Standard in
   the IETF required remove of any algorithms for which there was not
   demonstrated interoperability from the main standards document.  This
   required removal of the Minimal Canonicalization algorithm, in which
   there appears to be continued interest, to be dropped from the
   standards track specification. It is included here.

INTERNET-DRAFT                              Additional XML Security URIs


2. Algorithms

   The URI [RFC 2396] being dropped from the standard due to the
   transition from Proposed Standard to Draft Standard is included in
   Section 2.4 below with its original

        http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#

   prefix so as to avoid changing the XMLDSIG standard‚ÇÖs namespace.

   Additional algorithms are given URIs that start with

        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#

   An "xmldsig-more" URI does not imply any official W3C status for
   these algorithms or identifiers nor does it imply that they are only
   useful in digital signatures.  Currently, dereferencing such URIs may
   or may not produce a temporary placeholder document. Permission to
   use these this URI prefix has been given by the W3C.



2.1 DigestMethod Algorithms

   These algorithms are usable wherever a DigestMethod element occurs.



2.1.1 MD5

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#md5

   The MD5 algorithm [RFC 1321] takes no explicit parameters. An example
   of an MD5 DigestAlgorithm element is:

   <DigestAlgorithm
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#md5"/>

   An MD5 digest is a 128-bit string. The content of the DigestValue
   element shall be the base64 [RFC 2045] encoding of this bit string
   viewed as a 16-octet octet stream.



2.1.2 SHA-224

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha224



D. Eastlake 3rd                                                 [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT                              Additional XML Security URIs


   The SHA-224 algorithm [FIPS 180-2change, RFC 3874] takes no explicit
   parameters.  An example of a SHA-224 DigestAlgorithm element is:

   <DigestAlgorithm
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha224" />

   A SHA-224 digest is a 224 bit string. The content of the DigestValue
   element shall be the base64 [RFC2045] encoding of this string viewed
   as a 28-octet stream. Because it takes roughly the same amount of
   effort to compute a SHA-224 message digest as a SHA-256 digest and
   terseness is usually not a criteria in XML application, consideration
   should be given to the use of SHA-256 as an alternative.



2.1.3 SHA-384

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha384

   The SHA-384 algorithm [FIPS 180-2] takes no explicit parameters.  An
   example of a SHA-384 DigestAlgorithm element is:

   <DigestAlgorithm
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha384" />

   A SHA-384 digest is a 384 bit string. The content of the DigestValue
   element shall be the base64 [RFC2045] encoding of this string viewed
   as a 48-octet stream. Because it takes roughly the same amount of
   effort to compute a SHA-384 message digest as a SHA-512 digest and
   terseness is usually not a criteria in XML application, consideration
   should be given to the use of SHA-512 as an alternative.



2.2 SignatureMethod Message Authentication Code Algorithms

   Note: Some text in this section is duplicated from [RFC 3275] for the
   convenience of the reader. 3275 is normative in case of conflict.



2.2.1 HMAC-MD5

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-md5

   The HMAC algorithm [RFC 2104] takes the truncation length in bits as
   a parameter; if the parameter is not specified then all the bits of
   the hash are output. An example of an HMAC-MD5 SignatureMethod


D. Eastlake 3rd                                                 [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT                              Additional XML Security URIs


   element is as follows:

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-md5">
      <HMACOutputLength>112</HMACOutputLength>
   </SignatureMethod>

   The output of the HMAC algorithm is ultimately the output (possibly
   truncated) of the chosen digest algorithm. This value shall be base64
   [RFC 2405] encoded in the same straightforward fashion as the output
   of the digest algorithms. Example: the SignatureValue element for the
   HMAC-MD5 digest

        9294727A 3638BB1C 13F48EF8 158BFC9D

   from the test vectors in [RFC 2104] would be

        kpRyejY4uxwT9I74FYv8nQ==

   Schema Definition:

        <simpleType name="HMACOutputLength">
           <restriction base="integer">
        </simpleType>

   DTD:

        <!ELEMENT HMACOutputLength (#PCDATA) >

   The Schema Definition and DTD immediately above are copied from [RFC
   3275].

   Although some cryptographic suspicions have recently been cast on MD5
   for use in signatures such as RSA-MD5 below, this does not effect use
   of MD5 in HMAC.



2.2.2 HMAC SHA Variations

   Identifiers:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha224
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha256

        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha512

   SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 [FIPS 180-2, FIPS 180-2change,
   RFC 3874] can also be used in HMAC as described in section 2.2.1
   above for HMAC-MD5.

2.2.3 HMAC-RIPEMD160

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-ripemd160

   RIPEMD-160 [RIPEMD-160] can also be used in HMAC as described in
   section 2.2.1 above for HMAC-MD5.



2.3 SignatureMethod Public Key Signature Algorithms

   These algorithms are distinguished from those in Section 2.2 above in
   that they use public key methods. That is to say, the verification
   key is different from and not feasibly derivable from the signing
   key.



2.3.1 RSA-MD5

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-md5

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm described in [RFC
   2437]. An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-md5"
   />

   The SignatureValue content for an RSA-MD5 signature is the base64
   [RFC 2405] encoding of the octet string computed as per [RFC 2437],
   section 8.1.1, signature generation for the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5
   signature scheme. As specified in the EMSA-PKCS1-V1_5-ENCODE function
   in [RFC 2437, section 9.2.1], the value input to the signature
   function MUST contain a pre-pended algorithm object identifier for
   the hash function, but the availability of an ASN.1 parser and
   recognition of OIDs is not required of a signature verifier. The
   PKCS#1 v1.5 representation appears as:

        CRYPT (PAD (ASN.1 (OID, DIGEST (data))))

   Note that the padded ASN.1 will be of the following form:

        01 | FF* | 00 | prefix | hash

   Vertical bar ("|") represents concatenation. "01", "FF", and "00" are
   fixed octets of the corresponding hexadecimal value and the asterisk
   ("*") after "FF" indicates repetition. "hash" is the MD5 digest of


D. Eastlake 3rd                                                 [Page 7]


INTERNET-DRAFT                              Additional XML Security URIs


   the data. "prefix" is the ASN.1 BER MD5 algorithm designator prefix
   required in PKCS #1 [RFC 2437], that is,

        hex 30 20 30 0c 06 08 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 02 05 05 00 04 10

   This prefix is included to make it easier to use standard
   cryptographic libraries. The FF octet MUST be repeated enough times
   that the value of the quantity being CRYPTed is exactly one octet
   shorter than the RSA modulus.

   Due to increases in computer processor power and advances in
   cryptography, use of RSA-MD5 is NOT RECOMMENDED.



2.3.2 RSA-SHA256

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC 2437] as
   described in section 2.3.1 but with the ASN.1 BER SHA-256 algorithm
   designator prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256" />



2.3.3 RSA-SHA384

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha384

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC 2437] as
   described in section 2.3.1 but with the ASN.1 BER SHA-384 algorithm
   designator prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha384"
   />

   Because it takes about the same effort to calculate a SHA-384 message
   digest as it does a SHA-512 message digest, it is suggested that RSA-
   SHA512 be used in preference to RSA-SHA384 where possible.

2.3.4 RSA-SHA512

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha512

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC 2437] as
   described in section 2.3.1 but with the ASN.1 BER SHA-512 algorithm
   designator prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha512"
   />



2.3.5 RSA-RIPEMD160

   Identifier:
       http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more/rsa-ripemd160

   This implies the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding algorithm [RFC 2437] as
   described in section 2.3.1 but with the ASN.1 BER RIPEMD160 algorithm
   designator prefix.  An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more/rsa-ripemd160"

   is the elliptic curve analogue of the DSA (DSS) signature method. For
   a detailed specifications of how to use it with SHA hash functions
   and XML Digital Signature, please see [X9.62] and [ECDSA].



2.3.7 ESIGN-SHA1

   Identifier

        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#esign-sha512

   The ESIGN algorithm specified in [IEEE P1363a] is a signature scheme
   based on the integer factorization problem. It is much faster than
   previous digital signature schemes so ESIGN can be implemented on
   smart cards without special co-processors.

   An example of use is

   <SignatureMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#esign-sha1"
   />



2.4 Minimal Canonicalization

   Thus far two independent interoperable implementations of Minimal
   Canonicalization have not been announced.  Therefore, when XML
   Digital Signature was advanced from Proposed Standard [RFC 3075] to
   Draft Standard [RFC 3275], Minimal Canonicalization was dropped from
   the standard track documents.  However, there is still interest and
   indicates of possible future use for Minimal Canonicalization.  For
   its definition, see [RFC 3075], Section 6.5.1.

   For reference, it‚ÇÖs identifier remains:
        http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#minimal



2.5 Transform Algorithms

   Note that all CanonicalizationMethod algorithms can also be used as
   Transform algorithms.



2.5.1 XPointer

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more/xptr

   This transform algorithm takes an [XPointer] as an explicit
   parameter.  An example of use is:

   <Transform
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more/xptr">

            xpointer(id("foo")) xmlns(bar=http://foobar.example)
            xpointer(//bar:Zab[@Id="foo"])
      </XPointer>
   </Transform>

   Schema Definition:

        <element name="XPointer" type="string">

   DTD:

        <!ELEMENT XPointer (#PCDATA) >

   Input to this transform is an octet stream (which is then parsed into
   XML).

   Output from this transform is a node set; the results of the XPointer
   are processed as defined in the XMLDSIG specification [RFC 3275] for
   a same-document XPointer.



2.6 EncryptionMethod Algorithms

   This subsection gives identifiers and information for several
   EncryptionMethod Algorithms.



2.6.1 ARCFOUR Encryption Algorithm

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#arcfour

   ARCFOUR is a fast, simple stream encryption algorithm that is
   compatible with RSA Security‚ÇÖs RC4 algorithm. An example
   EncryptionMethod element using ARCFOUR is

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#arcfour">
      <KeySize>40<KeySize>
   </EncryptionMethod>

   Note that Arcfour makes use of the generic KeySize parameter
   specified and defined in [XMLENC].

2.6.2 Camellia Block Encryption

   Identifiers:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia128-cbc
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia192-cbc
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia256-cbc

   Camellia is an efficient and secure block cipher with the same
   interface as the AES [Camellia, RFC 3713], that is 128-bit block size
   and 128, 192, and 256 bit key sizes. In XML Encryption Camellia is
   used in the same way as the AES: It is used in the Cipher Block
   Chaining (CBC) mode with a 128-bit initialization vector (IV). The
   resulting cipher text is prefixed by the IV. If included in XML
   output, it is then base64 encoded. An example Camellia
   EncryptionMethod is as follows:

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm=
      "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#camellia128-cbc"
   />



2.6.3 Camellia Key Wrap

   Identifiers:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia128
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia192
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia256

   Camellia [Camellia, RFC 3713] key wrap is identical to the AES key
   wrap algorithm [RFC 3394] specified in the XML Encryption standard
   with "AES" replaced by "Camellia". As with AES key wrap, the check
   value is 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6.

   The algorithm is the same whatever the size of the Camellia key used
   in wrapping, called the key encrypting key or KEK. The implementation
   of Camellia is OPTIONAL. However, if it is supported, the same
   implementation guidelines as to which combinations of KEK size and
   wrapped key size should be required to be supported and which are
   optional to be supported should be followed. That is to say, if
   Camellia key wrap is supported, they wrapping 128-bit keys with a
   128-bit KEK and wrapping 256-bit keys with a 256-bit KEK are REQUIRED
   and all other combinations are OPTIONAL.

   An example of use is:

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm=
      "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#kw-camellia128"

2.6.4 PSEC-KEM

   Identifier:
        http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#psec-kem

   The PSEC-KEM algorithm, specified in [ISO/IEC 18033-2], is a key
   encapsulation mechanism using elliptic curve encryption.

   An example of use is:

   <EncryptionMethod
      Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#psec-kem">
      <ECParameters>
         <Version>version</Version>
         <FieldID>id</FieldID>
         <Curve>curve</Curve>
         <Base>base</Base>
         <Order>order</Order>
         <Cofactor>cofactor</Cofactor>
      </ECParameters>
   </EncryptionMethod>

   See [ISO/IEC 18033-2] for information on the parameters above.



3. KeyInfo

   In section 3.1 below a new KeyInfo element child is specified while
   in section 3.2 additional KeyInfo Type values for use in
   RetrievalMethod are specified.



3.1 PKCS #7 Bag of Certificates and CRLs

   A PKCS #7 [RFC 2315] "signedData" can also be used as a bag of
   certificates and/or certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  The
   PKCS7signedData element is defined to accommodate such structures
   within KeyInfo.  The binary PKCS #7 structure is base64 [RFC 2405]
   encoded.  Any signer information present is ignored.  The following
   is a example, eliding the base64 data:

   <foo:PKCS7signedData
      xmlns:foo="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more">
      ...
   </foo:PKCS7signedData>



3.2 Additional RetrievalMethod Type Values

   The Type attribute of RetrievalMethod is an optional identifier for
   the type of data to be retrieved. The result of de-referencing a
   RetrievalMethod reference for all KeyInfo types with an XML structure
   is an XML element or document with that element as the root. The
   various "raw" key information types return a binary value. Thus they
   require a Type attribute because they are not unambiguously
   parseable.

4. IANA Considerations

   None.

   As it is easy for people to construct their own unique URIs [RFC
   2396] and, possible, if appropriate, to obtain a URI from the W3C, it
   is not intended that any additional
   "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#" URIs be created beyond
   those enumerated in this document. (W3C Namespace stability rules
   prohibit the creation of new URIs under
   "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#".)



5. Security Considerations

   Due to computer speed and cryptographic advances, the use of MD5 as a
   DigestMethod or in the RSA-MD5 SignatureMethod is NOT RECOMMENDED.
   The cryptographic advances concerned do not effect the security of
   HMAC-MD5; however, there is little reason not to go for one of the
   SHA series of algorithms.
