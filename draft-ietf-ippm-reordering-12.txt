Abstract 
    
   This memo defines metrics to evaluate if a network has maintained 
   packet order on a packet-by-packet basis. It provides motivations 
   for the new metrics and discusses the measurement issues, including 
   the context information required for all metrics. The memo first 
   defines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for 
   sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several 
   useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design. 
   Additional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the

   distance between separate occurrences. We then define a metric 
   oriented toward assessing reordering effects on TCP. Several 
   examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are 
   included. An Appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating 
   order with packet fragmentation.

2. Introduction 
    
   Ordered arrival is a property found in packets that transit their 
   path, where the packet sequence number increases with each new 
   arrival and there are no backward steps. The Internet Protocol 
   [RFC791] has no mechanisms to assure either packet delivery or 
   sequencing, and higher layer protocols (above IP) should be prepared 
   to deal with both loss and reordering. This memo defines reordering 
   metrics. 
    
   A unique sequence identifier carried in each packet, such as an 
   incrementing consecutive integer message number, establishes the 
   Source Sequence.  
    
   The detection of reordering at the Destination is based on packet 
   arrival order in comparison with a non-reversing reference value.  
    
   This metric is consistent with [RFC2330], and classifies arriving 
   packets with sequence numbers smaller than their predecessors as 
   out-of-order, or reordered. For example, if sequentially numbered 
   packets arrive 1,2,4,5,3, then packet 3 is reordered. This is 
   equivalent to Paxon's reordering definition in [Pax98], where "late" 
   packets were declared reordered. The alternative is to emphasize 
   "premature" packets instead (4 and 5 in the example), but only the 
   arrival of packet 3 distinguishes this circumstance from packet 
   loss. Focusing attention on late packets allows us to maintain 
   orthogonality with the packet loss metric. The metric's construction 
   is very similar to the sequence space validation for received 
   segments in [RFC793]. Earlier work to define ordered delivery 
   includes [Cia00], [Ben99], [Lou01], [Bel02], [Jai02] and [Cia03]. 
    
2.1 Motivation 
    
   A reordering metric is relevant for most applications, especially 
   when assessing network support for Real-Time media streams. The 
   extent of reordering may be sufficient to cause a received packet to 
   be discarded by functions above the IP layer. 
    
   Packet order may change during transfer, and several specific path 
   characteristics can make reordering more likely.   
    
   Examples are: 
   * When two (or more) paths with slightly differing transfer times 
     support a single packet stream or flow, then packets traversing 
     the longer path(s) may arrive out-of-order. Multiple paths may be 
     used to achieve load balancing, or may arise from route 
     instability.  
   * To increase capacity, a network device designed with multiple 
     processors serving a single port (or parallel links) may reorder 
     as a byproduct. 
   * A layer 2 retransmission protocol that compensates for an error-
     prone link may cause packet reordering. 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006            Page 4 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   * If for any reason, the packets in a buffer are not serviced in the 
     order of their arrival, their order will change. 
   * If packets in a flow are assigned to multiple buffers (following 
     evaluation of traffic characteristics, for example), and the 
     buffers have different occupations and/or service rates, then 
     order will likely change. 
    
   When one or more of the above path characteristics are present 
   continuously, then reordering may be present on a steady-state 
   basis. The steady-state reordering condition typically causes an 
   appreciable fraction of packets to be reordered. This form of 
   reordering is most easily detected by minimizing the spacing between 
   test packets.  Transient reordering may occur in response to network 
   instability; temporary routing loops can cause periods of extreme 
   reordering. This condition is characterized by long in-order streams 
   with occasional instances of reordering, sometimes with extreme 
   correlation. However, we do not expect packet delivery in a 
   completely random order, where for example, the last packet or the 
   first packet in a sample is equally likely to arrive first at the 
   destination. Thus we expect at least a minimal degree of order in 
   the packet arrivals, as exhibited in real networks. 
    
   The ability to restore order at the destination will likely have 
   finite limits.  Practical hosts have receiver buffers with finite 
   size in terms of packets, bytes, or time (such as de-jitter 
   buffers). Once the initial determination of reordering is made, it 
   is useful to quantify the extent of reordering, or lateness, in all 
   meaningful dimensions.  
    
2.2 Goals and Objectives 
    
   The definitions below intend to satisfy the goals of: 
    
     1. Determining whether or not packet reordering has occurred. 
     2. Quantifying the degree of reordering. (We define a number of 
        metrics to meet this goal, because receiving procedures differ 
        by protocol or application. Since the effects of packet 
        reordering vary with these procedures, a metric that quantifies 
        a key aspect of one receiver's behavior could be irrelevant to 
        a different receiver. If all the metrics defined below are 
        reported, they give a wide-ranging view of reordering 
        conditions.)  
    
   Reordering Metrics MUST: 
    
   +  have one or more applications, such as receiver design or network 
      characterization, and a compelling relevance in the view of the 
      interested community. 
   +  be computable "on the fly" 
   +  work even if the stream has duplicate or lost packets 
    

  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006            Page 5 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   It is desirable for Reordering Metrics to have one or more of the 
   following attributes: 
    
   +  ability to concatenate results for segments measured separately 
      to estimate the reordering of an entire path 
   +  simplicity for easy consumption and understanding 
   +  relevance to TCP design 
   +  relevance to Real-time application performance 
    
   The current set of metrics meets all the requirements above and 
   provides all but the concatenation attribute (except in the case 
   where measurements of path segments exhibit no reordering, and one 
   may estimate that the complete path composed of these segments would 
   also exhibit no reordering). However, satisfying these goals 
   restricts the set of metrics to those that provide some clear 
   insight into network characterization or receiver design. They are 
   not likely to be exhaustive in their coverage of reordering effects 
   on applications, and additional measurements may be possible. 
    
2.3 Required Context for All Reordering Metrics 
    
   A critical aspect of all reordering metrics is their inseparable 
   bond with the measurement conditions. Packet reordering is not well 
   defined unless the full measurement context is reported. Therefore, 
   all reordering metric definitions include the following parameters: 
    
   1. The "Packet of Type-P" [RFC2330] identifiers for the packet 
   stream, including the transport addresses for source and 
   destination, and any other information which may result in different 
   packet treatments. 
    
   2. The stream parameter set for the sending discipline, such as the 
   parameters unique to Periodic Streams (as in [RFC3432]), TCP-like 
   Streams (as in [RFC3148]), or Poisson Streams (as in [RFC2330]). The 
   stream parameters include the packet size, either specified as a 
   fixed value or as a pattern of sizes (as applicable). 
    
   Whenever a metric is reported, it MUST include a description of 
   these parameters to provide a context for the results. 
    
3. A Reordered Packet Singleton Metric 
    
   The IPPM framework [RFC2330] describes the notions of singletons, 
   samples, and statistics. For easy reference: 
    
        By a 'singleton' metric, we refer to metrics that are,  
        in a sense, atomic.  For example, a single instance of "bulk 
        throughput capacity" from one host to another might be defined 
        as a singleton metric, even though the instance involves 
        measuring the timing of a number of Internet packets. 
    

  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006            Page 6 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   The evaluation of packet order requires several supporting concepts. 
   The first is an algorithm (function) that produces a series of 
   monotonically increasing identifiers applied to packets at the 
   source to uniquely establish the order of packet transmission.  The 
   unique sequence identifier may simply be an incrementing consecutive 
   integer message number, or sequence number as used below. The 
   prospect of sequence number roll-over is discussed in Section 6. 
    
   The second supporting concept is a stored value which is the "next 
   expected" packet number. Under normal conditions, the value of Next 
   Expected (NextExp) is the sequence number of the previous packet 
   plus 1 for message numbering (in general, the receiver reproduces 
   the sender's algorithm and the sequence of identifiers so that the 
   "next expected" can be determined). 
    
   Each packet within a packet stream can be evaluated with this order 
   singleton metric. 
    
3.1 Metric Name 
    
   Type-P-Reordered 
    
3.2 Metric Parameters 
    
   +  Src, the IP address of a host 
    
   +  Dst, the IP address of a host 
    
   +  SrcTime, the time of packet emission from the Source (or wire 
      time) 
    
   +  s, the unique packet sequence number applied at the Source, in 
      units of messages. 
    
   +  NextExp, the Next Expected Sequence number at the Destination, in 
      units of messages. The stored value in NextExp is determined from 
      a previously arriving packet. 
    
   And optionally:

      field and referred to when the SrcByte sequence is based on bytes 
      transfered.

      units of payload bytes. 
    
    
3.3 Definition 
    


  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006            Page 7 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   If a packet s, (sent at time, SrcTime) is found to be reordered by 
   comparison with the Next Expected value, its Type-P-Reordered = 
   TRUE; otherwise Type-P-Reordered = FALSE, as defined below: 
    
   The value of Type-P-Reordered is defined as TRUE if s < NextExp (the 
   packet is reordered). In this case, the NextExp value does not 
   change. 
    
   The value of Type-P-Reordered is defined as FALSE if s >= NextExp 
   (the packet is in-order). In this case, NextExp is set to s+1 for 
   comparison with the next packet to arrive. 
    
   Since the Next Expected value cannot decrease, it provides a non-
   reversing order criterion to identify reordered packets. 
    
   This definition can also be specified in pseudo-code. 
     
   On successful arrival of a packet with sequence number s: 
        if s >= NextExp then /* s is in-order */ 
                NextExp = s + 1; 
                Type-P-Reordered = False;  
        else     /* when s < NextExp */ 
                Type-P-Reordered = True  
    
3.4 Sequence Discontinuity Definition 
    
   Packets with s > NextExp are a special case of in-order delivery. 
   This condition indicates a sequence discontinuity, either because of 
   packet loss or reordering. Reordered packets must arrive for the 
   sequence discontinuity to be defined as a reordering discontinuity 
   (see section 4).  
    
   We define two different states for in-order packets.  
    
   When s = NextExp, the original sequence has been maintained, and 
   there is no discontinuity present. 
    
   When s > NextExp, some packets in the original sequence have not yet 
   arrived, and there is a sequence discontinuity associated with 
   packet s.  The size of the discontinuity is s - NextExp, equal to 
   the number of packets presently missing, either reordered or lost. 
    
   In pseudo-code: 
     
   On successful arrival of a packet with sequence number s: 
        if s >= NextExp, then /* s is in-order */ 
                if s > NextExp then 
                          SequenceDiscontinuty = True; 
                          SeqDiscontinutySize = s - NextExp; 
                else 
                          SequenceDiscontinuty = False; 
                NextExp = s + 1; 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006            Page 8 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
                Type-P-Reordered = False; 
    
        else /* when s < NextExp */ 
                Type-P-Reordered = True; 
                SequenceDiscontinuty = False; 
    
   Whether any Sequence Discontinuities occur (and their size) is 
   determined by the conditions causing loss and/or reordering along 
   the measurement path. Note that a packet could be reordered at one 
   point, and subsequently lost elsewhere on the path, but this cannot 
   be known from observations at the Destination. 
    
3.5 Evaluation of Reordering in Dimensions of Time or Bytes 
    
   It is possible to use alternate dimensions of time or payload bytes 
   to test for reordering in the definition of section 3.3, as long as 
   the SrcTimes and SrcBytes are unique and reliable. Sequence 
   Discontinuities are easily defined and detected with message 
   numbering, however, this is not so simple in the dimensions of time 
   or bytes. This is a detractor for the alternate dimensions because 
   the Sequence Discontinuity definition plays a key role in the sample 
   metrics that follow.  
    
   It is possible to detect Sequence Discontinuities with payload byte 
   numbering, but only when the complete pattern of payload sizes is 
   stored at the Destination, or when payload size is constant and then 
   the byte numbering adds needless complexity over message numbering. 
    
   It may be possible to detect Sequence Discontinuities with Periodic 
   Streams and Source Time numbering, but there are practical pitfalls 
   with sending exactly on-schedule and with clock reliability. 
    
   The dimensions of time and bytes remain an important basis for 
   characterizing the extent of reordering, as described in sections 
   4.3 and 4.4. 
    
    
3.6 Discussion 
    
   Any arriving packet bearing a sequence number from the sequence that 
   establishes the Next Expected value can be evaluated to determine 
   whether it is in-order or reordered, based on a previous packet's 
   arrival. In the case where Next Expected is Undefined (because the 
   arriving packet is the first successful transfer), the packet is 
   designated in-order (Type-P-Reordered=FALSE). 
    
   This metric assumes re-assembly of packet fragments before 
   evaluation. In principle, it is possible to use the Type-P-Reordered 
   metric to evaluate reordering among packet fragments, but each 
   fragment must contain source sequence information. 
   See the Appendix on fragment order evaluation for more detail.

Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   If duplicate packets (multiple non-corrupt copies) arrive at the 
   destination, they MUST be noted and only the first to arrive is 
   considered for further analysis (copies would be declared reordered 
   according to the definition above). This requirement has the same 
   storage implications as earlier IPPM metrics, and follows the 
   precedent of RFC 2679. We provide a suggestion to minimize storage 
   size needed in Section 6 on Measurement and Implementation Issues. 
    
    
4. Sample Metrics 
    
   In this section, we define metrics applicable to a sample of packets 
   from a single Source sequence number system. When reordering occurs, 
   it is highly desirable to assert the degree to which a packet is 
   out-of-order, or reordered with respect other packets. This section 
   defines several metrics that quantify the extent of reordering in 
   various units of measure. Each metric highlights a relevant use. 
    
   The metrics in the sub-sections below have a network 
   characterization orientation, but also have relevance to receiver 
   design where reordering compensation is of interest. We begin with a 
   simple ratio metric indicating the reordered portion of the sample. 
    
    
4.1 Reordered Packet Ratio 
    
4.1.1 Metric Name 
    
   Type-P-Reordered-Ratio-Stream 
    
4.1.2 Metric Parameters 
    
   The parameter set includes Type-P-Reordered singleton parameters, 
   the parameters unique to Poisson Streams (as in [RFC2330], Periodic 
   Streams (as in [RFC3432]), or TCP-like Streams (as in [RFC3148]), 
   packet size or size patterns, and the following: 
    
   + T0, a start time 
    
   + Tf, an end time 
    
   + dT, a waiting time for each packet to arrive 
    
   + K,  the total number of packets in the stream sent from Source to 
     Destination  
    
   + L,  the total number of packets received (arriving between T0 and 
     Tf+dT) out of the K packets sent. Recall that identical copies 
     (duplicates) have been removed, so L <= K. 
    
4.1.3 Definition

Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   Given a stream of packets sent from a Source to a Destination, the 
   ratio of reordered packets in the sample is 
    
   (Count of packets with Type-P-Reordered=TRUE) / ( L ) 
    
   This fraction may be expressed as a percentage (multiply by 100). 
   Note that in the case of duplicate packets, only the first copy is 
   used. 
    
4.1.4 Discussion 
    
   When the Type-P-Reordered-Ratio-Stream is zero, no further 
   reordering metrics need be examined for that sample. Therefore, the 
   value of this metric is its simple ability to summarize the results 
   for a reordering-free sample. 
    
     
4.2 Reordering Extent 
    
   This section defines the extent to which packets are reordered, and 
   associates a specific Sequence Discontinuity with each reordered 
   packet. This section inherits the Parameters defined above. 
    
4.2.1 Metric Name 
    
   Type-P-Packet-Reordering-Extent-Stream 
    
4.2.2 Notation and Metric Parameters  
    
   Recall that K is the number of packets in the stream at the Source 
   and L is the number of packets received at the Destination. 
    
   Each packet has been assigned a sequence number, s, a consecutive 
   integer from 1 to K in the order of packet transmission (at the 
   source). 
    
   Let s[1], s[2], ..., s[L], represent the original sequence numbers 
   associated with the packets in order of arrival.  
    
   s[i] can be thought of as a vector, where the index i is the arrival 
   position of the packet with sequence number s.  In theory, any 
   Source sequence number could appear in any arrival position, but 
   this is unlikely in reality. 
    
   Consider a reordered packet (Type-P-Reordered=TRUE) with arrival 
   index i and source sequence number s[i]. There exists a set of 
   indexes j (1 <= j < i) such that s[j] > s[i]. 
    
   The new parameters are: 
    
   + i,     the index for arrival position, where i-1 represents an 
     arrival earlier than i. 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 11 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
   + j,     a set of one or more arrival indexes,  where 1 <= j < i. 
    
   + s[i],  the original sequence numbers, s, in order of arrival. 
    
   + e,     the Reordering Extent, defined below. 
    
    
4.2.3 Definition  
    
   The reordering extent, e, of packet s[i] is defined to be i-j for 
   the smallest value of j where s[j] > s[i]. 
    
   Informally, the reordering extent is the maximum distance, in 
   packets, from a reordered packet to the earliest packet received 
   that has a larger sequence number.  If a packet is in-order, its 
   reordering extent is undefined. The first packet to arrive is in-
   order by definition, and has undefined reordering extent. 
    
   Comment on the definition of extent:  For some arrival orders, the 
   assignment of a simple position/distance as the reordering extent 
   tends to overestimate the receiver storage needed to restore order.  
   A more accurate and complex procedure to calculate packet storage 
   would be to subtract any earlier reordered packets that the receiver 
   could pass on to the upper layers (see the Byte Offset metric). With 
   the bias understood, this definition is deemed sufficient, 
   especially for those who demand "on the fly" calculations. 
    
4.2.4 Discussion 
    
   The packet with index j (s[j], identified in the Definition above) 
   is the reordering discontinuity associated with packet s at index i 
   (s[i]). This definition is formalized below. 
    
   Note that the K packets in the stream could be some subset of a 
   larger stream, but L is still the total number of packets received 
   out of the K packets sent in that subset. 
    
   If a receiver intends to restore order, then its buffer capacity 
   determines its ability to handle packets that are reordered. For 
   cases with single reordered packets, the extent e gives the number 
   of packets that must be held in the receiver's buffer while waiting 
   for the reordered packet to complete the sequence. For more complex 
   scenarios, the extent may be an overestimate of required storage 
   (see section 4.4 on Reordering Byte Offset and the Examples 
   section).  
    
   Although reordering extent primarily quantifies the offset in terms 
   of arrival position, it may also be useful for determining the 
   portion of reordered packets that can or cannot be restored to order 
   in a typical receiver buffer based on their arrival order alone (and 
   without the aid of retransmission).

Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
   A sample's reordering extents may be expressed as a histogram, to 
   easily summarize the frequency of various extents.  
    
    
4.3 Reordering Late Time Offset 
    
   Reordered packets can be assigned offset values indicating their 
   lateness in terms of buffer time that a receiver must possess to 
   accommodate them. Offset metrics are calculated only on reordered 
   packets, as identified by the reordered packet singleton metric in 
   Section 3. 
    
4.3.1 Metric Name  
    
   Type-P-Packet-Late-Time-Stream 
    
4.3.2 Metric Parameters  
    
   In addition to the parameters defined for Type-P-Reordered-Ratio-
   Stream, we specify: 
    
   +  DstTime, the time that each packet in the stream arrives at the 
     destination, and may be associated with index i, or packet s[i] 
    
   +  LateTime(s[i]), the offset of packet s[i] in time, defined below 
    
4.3.3 Definition  
    
   Lateness in time is calculated using destination times. When 
   received packet s[i] is reordered, and has a reordering extent e, 
   then: 
    
   LateTime(s[i]) = DstTime(i)-DstTime(i-e) 
    
   Alternatively, using similar notation to that of section 4.2, an 
   equivalent definition is: 
    
   LateTime(s[i]) = DstTime(i)-DstTime(j), for min{j|1<=j<i} that 
   satisfies s[j]>s[i]. 
    
4.3.4 Discussion  
    
   The offset metrics can help predict whether reordered packets will 
   be useful in a general receiver buffer system with finite limits.  
   The limit may be the time of storage prior to a cyclic play-out 
   instant (as with de-jitter buffers). 
    
   Note that the One-way IPDV [RFC3393] gives the delay variation for a 
   packet w.r.t. the preceding packet in the source sequence. Lateness 
   and IPDV give an indication of whether a buffer at the destination 
   has sufficient storage to accommodate the network's behavior and 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 13 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   restore order. When an earlier packet in the Source sequence is 
   lost, IPDV will necessarily be undefined for adjacent packets, and 
   LateTime may provide the only way to evaluate the usefulness of a 
   packet. 
    
   In the case of de-jitter buffers, there are circumstances where the 
   receiver employs loss concealment at the intended play-out time of a 
   late packet. However, if this packet arrives out of order, the Late 
   Time determines whether the packet is still useful. IPDV no longer 
   applies, because the receiver establishes a new play-out schedule 
   with additional buffer delay to accommodate similar events in the 
   future (this requires very minimal processing). 
    
   The combination of loss and reordering influences the LateTime 
   metric. If presented with the arrival sequence 1, 10, 5 (where 
   packets 2, 3, 4, and 6 through 9 are lost), LateTime would not 
   indicate exactly how "late" packet 5 is from its intended arrival 
   position. IPDV [RFC3393] would not capture this either, because of 
   the lack of adjacent packet pairs.  Assuming a Periodic Stream 
   [RFC3432], an expected arrival time could be defined for all 
   packets, but this is essentially a single-point delay variation 
   metric (as defined in ITU-T Recommendations [I.356] and [Y.1540]), 
   and not a reordering metric. 
    
   A sample's LateTime results may be expressed as a histogram, to  
   summarize the frequency of buffer times needed to accommodate 
   reordered packets and permit buffer tuning on that basis. A CDF with 
   buffer time vs. percent of reordered packets accommodated may be 
   informative. 
    
4.4 Reordering Byte Offset 
    
   Reordered packets can be assigned offset values indicating the 
   storage in bytes that a receiver must possess to accommodate them. 
   Offset metrics are calculated only on reordered packets, as 
   identified by the reordered packet singleton metric in Section 3. 
    
4.4.1 Metric Name  
    
   Type-P-Packet-Byte-Offset-Stream 
    
4.4.2 Metric Parameters 
    
   We use the same parameters defined earlier, including the optional 
   parameters of SrcByte and PayloadSize, and define: 
    
   +  ByteOffset(s[i]), the offset of packet s[i] in bytes 
    
4.4.3 Definition  
    
   The Byte stream offset for reordered packet s[i] is the sum of the 
   payload sizes of packets qualified by the following criteria: 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 14 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
   * Arrival prior to the reordered packet, s[i], and  
    
   * The send sequence number, s, is greater than s[i].  
    
   Packets that meet both these criteria are normally buffered until 
   the sequence beneath them is complete. Note that these criteria 
   apply to both in-order and reordered packets. 
    
   For reordered packet s[i] with a reordering extent e: 
   ByteOffset(s[i]) = Sum[qualified packets] 
                    = Sum[PayloadSize(packet at i-1 if qualified), 
                        PayloadSize(packet at i-2 if qualified), ... 
                        PayloadSize(packet at i-e always qualified)] 
    
   Using our earlier notation:  
   ByteOffset(s[i]) =  
               Sum[payloads of s[j] where s[j]>s[i] and i > j >= i-e] 
    
    
4.4.4 Discussion 
    
   We note that estimates of buffer size due to reordering depend  
   greatly on the test stream, in terms of the spacing between test 
   packets and their size, especially when packet size is variable. In 
   these and other circumstances, it may be most useful to characterize 
   offset in terms of the payload size(s) of stored packets, using the 
   Type-P-packet-Byte-Offset-Stream metric. 
    
   The byte offset metric can help predict whether reordered packets 
   will be useful in a general receiver buffer system with finite 
   limits.  The limit is expressed as the number of bytes the buffer 
   can store. 
    
   A sample's ByteOffset results may be expressed as a histogram, to  
   summarize the frequency of buffer lengths needed to accommodate 
   reordered packets and permit buffer tuning on that basis. A CDF with 
   buffer size vs. percent of reordered packets accommodated may be 
   informative. 
    
    
4.5 Gaps between multiple Reordering Discontinuities 
    
4.5.1 Metric Name 
    
   Type-P-Packet-Reordering-Gap-Stream 
    
4.5.2 Parameters  
    
   We use the same parameters defined earlier, but add the convention 
   that index i' is greater than i, likewise j' > j, and define: 
    
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 15 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   +  Gap(s[j']), the Reordering Gap of packet s[j'] in units of 
      integer messages 
    
   +  GapTime(s[j']), the Reordering Gap of packet s[j'] in units of 
      time 
    
4.5.3 Definition of Reordering Discontinuity   
    
   All reordered packets are associated with a packet at a reordering 
   discontinuity, defined as the in-order packet s[j] that arrived at 
   the minimum value of j (1<=j<i) for which s[j]> s[i]. 
    
   Note that s[j] will have been found to cause a sequence 
   discontinuity, where s > NextExp when evaluated with the reordered 
   singleton metric as described in section 3.4. 
    
   Recall that i - e = min(j). Subsequent reordered packets may be 
   associated with the same s[j], or with a different discontinuity. 
   This fact is used in the definition of the Reordering Gap, below. 
    
4.5.4 Definition of Reordering Gap  
    
   A reordering gap is the distance between successive reordering 
   discontinuities. Type-P-packet-Reordering-Gap-Stream assigns a value 
   to (all) packets in a stream. 
    
   If:  
    
      The packet s[j'] is found to be a reordering discontinuity, based 
      on the arrival of reordered packet s[i'] with extent e', and  
       
      an earlier reordering discontinuity s[j], based on the arrival of 
      reordered packet s[i] with extent e was already detected, and 
       
      i' > i, and  
       
      there are no reordering discontinuities between j and j', 
         
   then the Reordering Gap for packet s[j'] is the difference between 
   the arrival positions the reordering discontinuities, as shown 
   below: 
    
   Gap(s[j'])    =   (j')  -  (j) 
    
   Otherwise: 
    
   The Type-P-packet-Reordering-Gap-Stream for the packet is 0. 
    
   Gaps may also be expressed in time: 
    
   GapTime(s[j']) = DstTime(j') - DstTime(j) 
    
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 16 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
4.5.5 Discussion  
    
   When separate reordering discontinuities can be distinguished, then 
   a count may also be reported (along with the discontinuity 
   description, such as the number of reordered packets associated with 
   that discontinuity and their extents and offsets). The Gaps between 
   a sample's reordering discontinuities may be expressed as a 
   histogram, to easily summarize the frequency of various gaps. 
   Reporting the mode, average, range, etc. may also summarize the 
   distributions. 
    
   The Gap metric may help to correlate the frequency of reordering 
   discontinuities with their cause. Gap lengths are also informative 
   to receiver designers, revealing the period of reordering 
   discontinuities. The combination of reordering gaps and extent 
   reveals whether receivers will be required to handle cases of 
   overlapping reordered packets. 
    
4.6 Reordering-free Runs 
    
   This section defines a metric based on a count of consecutive in-
   order packets between reordered packets. 
    
4.6.1 Metric Name 
    
   Type-P-Packet-Reordering-Free-Run-Stream 
    
4.6.2 Parameters  
    
   We use the same parameters defined earlier, and define the 
   following: 
    
   + r, the run counter 
    
   + x, the number of runs, also the number of reordered packets 
    
   + a, the accumulator of in-order packets 
    
   + p, the number of packets (when the stream is complete, p=(x+a)=L) 
    
   + q, the sum of the squares of the runs counted 
    
4.6.3 Definition 
    
   As packets in a sample arrive at the Destination, the count of in-
   order packets between reordered packets is a Reordering-Free run. 
   Note that the minimum run-length is zero according to this 
   definition. A pseudo code example follows: 
 
   r = 0; /* r is the run counter */ 
   x = 0; /* x is the number of runs */ 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 17 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   a = 0; /* a is the accumulator of in-order packets */ 
   p = 0; /* p is the number of packets */ 
   q = 0; /* q is the sum of the squares of the runs counted */ 
 
   while(packets arrive with sequence number s) 
   { 
        p++; 
        if (s >= NextExp) /* s is in-order */ 
                then r++; 
                a++; 
        else    /* s is reordered */ 
                q+= r*r; 
                r = 0; 
                x++; 
   } 
    
   Each in-order arrival increments the run counter and the accumulator 
   of in-order packets, each reordered packet resets the run counter 
   after adding it to the sum of the squared lengths. 
    
   Each arrival of a reordered packet yields a new run count.  Long 
   runs accompany periods where order was maintained, while short runs 
   indicate frequent, or multi-packet reordering. 
    
   The percent of packets in-order is 100*a/p 
 
   The average Reordering-Free run length is a/x 
 
   The q counter gives an indication of variation of the Reordering-
   Free runs from the average by comparing q/a to a/x  ((q/a)/(a/x)) 
 
4.6.4 Discussion and Illustration 
    
   Type-P-packet-Reordering-Free-Run-Stream parameters give a brief 
   summary of the stream's reordering characteristics including the 
   average reordering-free run length, and the variation of run 
   lengths, therefore a key application of this metric is network 
   evaluation. 
 
   For 36 packets with 3 runs of 11 in-order packets we have: 
      p = 36 
      x = 3 
      a = 33 
      q = 3 * (11*11) = 363 
      ave reordering-free run = 11 
      q/a = 11 
      (q/a)/(a/x) = 1.0 
 
   For 36 packets with 3 runs, 2 runs of length 1 and one of length 31 
      p = 36 
      x = 3 
      a = 33

Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
      q = 1 + 1 + 961 = 963 
      ave reordering-free run = 11 
      q/a = 29.18 
      (q/a)/(a/x) = 2.65 
    
   The variability in run length is prominent in the difference between 
   the q values (sum of the squared run lengths) and comparing average 
   run length to the (q/a)/(a/x) ratios (equals 1 when all runs are the 
   same length). 
    
5. Metrics Focused on Receiver Assessment: A TCP-Relevant Metric 
    
   This section describes a metric that conveys information associated 
   with the effect of reordering on TCP.  However, in order to infer 
   anything about TCP performance, the test stream MUST bear a close 
   resemblance to the TCP sender of interest. [RFC3148] lists the 
   specific aspects of congestion control algorithms that must be 
   specified. Further, RFC 3148 recommends that Bulk Transfer Capacity 
   metrics SHOULD have instruments to distinguish three cases of packet 
   reordering (in section 3.3). The sample metrics defined above 
   satisfy the requirements to classify packets that are slightly or 
   grossly out-of-order. The metric in this section adds the capability 
   to estimate whether reordering might cause the DUP-ACK threshold to 
   be exceeded causing the Fast Retransmit algorithm to be invoked. 
   Additional TCP Kernel Instruments are summarized in [Mat03]. 
    
5.1 Metric Name 
    
   Type-P-Packet-n-Reordering-Stream 
    
5.2 Parameter Notation 
    
   Let n be a positive integer (a parameter).  Let k be a positive 
   integer equal to the number of packets sent (sample size).  Let l be 
   a non-negative integer representing the number of packets that were 
   received out of the k packets sent.  (Note that there is no 
   relationship between k and l: on one hand, losses can make l less 
   than k; on the other hand, duplicates can make l greater than k.)  
   Assign each sent packet a sequence number, 1 to k, in order of 
   packet emission.   
    
   Let s[1], s[2], ..., s[l] be the original sequence numbers of the 
   received packets, in the order of arrival. 
    
5.3 Definitions  
    
   Definition 1: Received packet number i (n < i <= l), with source 
   sequence number s[i], is n-reordered if and only if for all j such 
   that i-n <= j < i, s[j] > s[i]. 
    
   Claim: If by this definition, a packet's reordering is n and 0 < n' 
   < n, then the packet is also reordered to the n' extent. 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 19 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
   Note: This definition is illustrated by C code in Appendix A.  It 
   determines the n-reordering for a value of n=3 (when actually 
   writing applications that would report the metric, one would 
   probably report it for several values of n, such as 1, 2, 3, 4 -- 
   and maybe a few more consecutive values).  
    
   This definition does not assign an n to all reordered packets as 
   defined by the singleton metric, in particular when blocks of 
   successive packets are reordered. (In the arrival sequence 
   s={1,2,3,7,8,9,4,5,6}, packets 4, 5, and 6 are reordered, but only 
   packet 4 is n-reordered, with n=3.)  
    
   Definition 2: The degree of n-reordering of the sample is m/l, where 
   m is the number of n-reordered packets in the sample. 
    
   Definition 3: The degree of "monotonic reordering" of the sample is 
   its degree of 1-reordering. 
    
   Definition 4: A sample is said to have no reordering if its degree 
   of n-reordering is 0. 
    
5.4 Discussion 
    
   The degree of n-reordering may be expressed as a percentage, in 
   which case the number from Definition 2 is multiplied by 100. 
    
   The n-reordering metric is helpful for matching the duplicate ACK 
   threshold setting to a given path.  For example, if a path exhibits 
   no more than 5-reordering, a DUP-ACK threshold of 6 may avoid 
   unnecessary retransmissions. 
    
   Important special cases are n=1 and n=3:  
    
   - For n=1, absence of 1-reordering means the sequence numbers that 
   the receiver sees are monotonically increasing with respect to the 
   previous arriving packet. 
    
   - For n=3, a NewReno TCP sender would retransmit 1 packet in 
   response to an instance of 3-reordering and therefore consider this 
   packet lost for the purposes of congestion control (the sender will 
   halve its congestion window, see [RFC2581]). Three is default 
   threshold for Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) [RFC2960], 
   and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340] when 
   used with Congestion Control ID 2: TCP-like Congestion Control 
   [RFC4341]. 
    
   A sample's n-reordering may be expressed as a histogram, to 
   summarize the frequency for each value of n.  
    
   We note that the definition of n-reordering cannot predict the exact 
   number of packets unnecessarily retransmitted by a TCP sender under

   some circumstances, such as cases with closely-spaced reordered 
   singletons. Both time and position influence the sender's behavior.  
    
   A packet's n-reordering designation is sometimes equal to its 
   reordering extent, e. n-reordering is different in the following 
   ways: 
    
   1. n is a count of early packets with consecutive arrival positions 
   at the receiver. 
    
   2. Reordered packets (Type-P-Reordered=TRUE) may not be n-reordered, 
   but will have an extent, e (see the examples). 
    
    
6. Measurement and Implementation Issues 
    
   The results of tests will be dependent on the time interval between 
   measurement packets (both at the Source, and during transport where 
   spacing may change).  Clearly, packets launched infrequently (e.g., 
   1 per 10 seconds) are unlikely to be reordered.  
    
   In order to gauge the reordering for an application according to the 
   metrics defined in this memo, it is RECOMMENDED to use the same 
   sending pattern as the application of interest. In any case, the 
   exact method of packet generation MUST be reported with the 
   measurement results, including all stream parameters. 
    
   +  To make inferences about applications that use TCP, it is 
      REQUIRED to use TCP-like Streams as in [RFC3148] 
    
   +  For real-time applications, it is RECOMMENDED to use Periodic 
      Streams as in [RFC3432] 
    
   It is acceptable to report the metrics of Sections 3 and 4 with 
   other IPPM metrics using Poisson Streams [RFC2330]. Poisson streams 
   represent an "unbiased sample" of network performance for packet 
   loss and delay metrics. However, it would be incorrect to make 
   inferences about the application categories above using reordering 
   metrics measured with Poisson streams. 
    
   Test stream designers may prefer to use a periodic sending interval 
   so that a known temporal bias is maintained, also bringing 
   simplified results analysis (as described in [RFC3432]). In this 
   case, it is RECOMMENDED that the periodic sending interval should be 
   chosen to reproduce the closest Source packet spacing expected. 
   Testers must recognize that streams sent at the link speed 
   serialization limit MUST have limited duration and MUST consider 
   packet loss as an indication that the stream has caused congestion, 
   and suspend further testing.

Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   When intending to compare independent measurements of reordering, it 
   is RECOMMENDED to use the same test stream parameters in each 
   measurement system. 
    
   Packet lengths might also be varied to attempt to detect instances 
   of parallel processing (they may cause steady state reordering). For 
   example, a line-speed burst of the longest (MTU-length) packets 
   followed by a burst of the shortest possible packets may be an 
   effective detecting pattern.  Other size patterns are possible. 
    
   The non-reversing order criterion and all metrics described above 
   remain valid and useful when a stream of packets experiences packet 
   loss, or both loss and reordering. In other words, losses alone do 
   not cause subsequent packets to be declared reordered. 
    
   Assuming that the necessary sequence information (message number) is 
   included in the packet payload (possibly in application headers such 
   as RTP), reordering metrics may be evaluated in a passive 
   measurement arrangement.  Also, it is possible to evaluate order at 
   any point along a Source-Destination path, recognizing that 
   intermediate measurements may differ from those made at the 
   Destination (where the reordering effect on applications can be 
   inferred). 
    
   It is possible to apply these metrics to evaluate reordering in a 
   TCP sender's stream. In this case, the Source sequence numbers would 
   be based on byte stream, or segment numbering. Since the stream may 
   include retransmissions due to loss or reordering, care must be 
   taken to avoid declaring retransmitted packets reordered. The 
   additional sequence reference of s or SrcTime helps to avoid this 
   ambiguity, or the optional TCP timestamp field [RFC1323]. 
    
   Since this metric definition may use sequence numbers with finite 
   range, it is possible that the sequence numbers could reach end-of-
   range and roll over to zero during a measurement.  By definition, 
   the Next Expected value cannot decrease, and all packets received 
   after a roll-over would be declared reordered.  Sequence number 
   roll-over can be avoided by using combinations of counter size and 
   test duration where roll-over is impossible (and sequence is reset 
   to zero at the start). Also, message-based numbering results in 
   slower sequence consumption.  There may still be cases where 
   methodological mitigation of this problem is desirable (e.g., long-
   term testing).  The elements of mitigation are: 
    
   1. There must be a test to detect if a roll-over has occurred.  It 
   would be nearly impossible for the sequence numbers of successive 
   packets to jump by more than half the total range, so these large 
   discontinuities are designated as roll-over. 
    
   2. All sequence numbers used in computations are represented in a 
   sufficiently large precision.  The numbers have a correction applied 

  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 22 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   (equivalent to adding a significant digit) whenever roll-over is 
   detected.  
    
   3. Reordered packets coincident with sequence numbers reaching end-
   of-range must also be detected for proper application of correction 
   factor. 
    
   Ideally, the test instrument would have the ability to use all 
   earlier packets at any point in the test stream. In practice there 
   will be limited ability to determine reordering extent, due to the 
   storage requirements for previous packets. Saving only packets that 
   indicate discontinuities (and their arrival positions) will reduce 
   storage volume. 
    
   Another solution is to use a sliding history window of packets, 
   where the window size would be determined by an upper bound on the 
   useful reordering extent. This bound could be several packets or 
   several seconds worth of packets, depending on the intended 
   analysis. When discarding all stream information beyond the window, 
   the reordering extent or degree of n-reordering may need to be 
   expressed as greater than the window length if the reordering 
   discontinuity information has been discarded, and Gap calculations 
   would not be possible. 
    
   The requirement to ignore duplicate packets also mandates storage. 
   Here, tracking the sequence numbers of missing packets may minimize 
   storage size. Missing packets may eventually be declared lost, or 
   reordered if they arrive. The missing packet list and the largest 
   sequence number received thus far (NextExp - 1) are sufficient 
   information to determine if a packet is a duplicate (assuming a 
   manageable storage size for packets that are missing due to loss). 
    
   It is important to note that practical IP networks also have limited 
   ability to "store" packets, even when routing loops appear 
   temporarily. Therefore, the maximum storage for reordering metrics 
   (and their complexity) would only approach the number packets in the 
   sample, K, when the sending time for K packets is small with respect 
   to the network's largest possible transfer time. Another possible 
   limitation on storage is the maximum length of the sequence number 
   field, assuming that most test streams do not exhaust this length in 
   practice. 
    
   Last, we note that determining reordering extents and gaps is tricky 
   when there are overlapped or nested events. Test instrument 
   complexity and reordering complexity are directly correlated.

7. Examples of Arrival Order Evaluation 
    
   This section provides some examples to illustrate how the non-
   reversing order criterion works, how n-reordering works in 
   comparison, and the value of quantifying reordering in all the 
   dimensions of time, bytes, and position.  
     
   Throughout this section, we will refer to packets by their source 
   sequence number, except where noted.  So "Packet 4" refers to the 
   packet with source sequence number 4, and the reader should refer to 
   the tables in each example to determine packet 4's arrival index 
   number, if needed. 
    
7.1 Example with a Single Packet Reordered 
    
   Table 1 gives a simple case of reordering, where one packet is 
   reordered, Packet 4. Packets are listed according to their arrival, 
   and message numbering is used. All packets contain PayloadSize=100 
   bytes, with SrcByte=(s x 100)-99 for s=1,2,3,4,...

    2     2      20      88      68       0      2

    5     4      80     148      68     -82      4               
    6     6     100     168      68       0      5               
    7     7     120     188      68       0      6               
    8     8     140     208      68       0      7               
    4     9      60     210     150      82      8      400     62 
    9     9     160     228      68       0      9               
   10    10     180     248      68       0     10               
    
   Each column gives the following information: 
 
   s        Packet sequence number at the Source. 
   NextExp  The value of NextExp when the packet arrived(before 
   update). 
   SrcTime  Packet time stamp at the Source, ms. 
   DstTime  Packet time stamp at the Destination, ms. 
   Delay    1-way delay of the packet, ms. 
   IPDV     IP Packet Delay Variation, ms  
            IPDV = Delay(SrcNum)-Delay(SrcNum-1) 
   DstOrder Order in which the packet arrived at the Destination. 
   Byte Offset  The Byte Offset of a reordered packet, in bytes. 
   LateTime The lateness of a reordered packet, in ms. 
 
   We can see that when Packet 4 arrives, NextExp=9, and it is declared 
   reordered. We compute the extent of reordering as follows: 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 24 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
   Using the notation <s[1], ..., s[i], ..., s[L]>, the received 
   packets are represented as: 
    
                            \/ 
   s = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 9, 10 
   i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 
                            /\ 
    
   Applying the definition of Type-P-packet-Reordering-Extent-Stream: 
   when j=7, 8 > 4, so the reordering extent is 1 or more. 
   when j=6, 7 > 4, so the reordering extent is 2 or more. 
   when j=5, 6 > 4, so the reordering extent is 3 or more. 
   when j=4, 5 > 4, so the reordering extent is 4 or more. 
   when j=3, but 3 < 4, and 4 is the maximum extent, e=4 (assuming 
   there are no earlier sequence discontinuities, as in this example). 
    
   Further, we can compute the Late Time (210-148=62ms using DstTime) 
   compared to Packet 5's arrival.  If the receiver has a de-jitter 
   buffer that holds more than 4 packets, or at least 62 ms storage, 
   Packet 4 may be useful. Note that 1-way delay and IPDV indicate 
   unusual behavior for Packet 4. Also, if Packet 4 had arrived at 
   least 62ms earlier, it would have been in-order in this example. 
    
   If all packets contained 100 byte payloads, then Byte Offset is 
   equal to 400 bytes. 
    
   Following the definitions of section 5.1, Packet 4 is designated 4-
   reordered.

   Table 2 shows a case where Packets 5 and 6 arrive just behind Packet 
   7, so both 5 and 6 are reordered. The Late times (189-188=1, 190-
   188=2) are small.

   Using the notation <s[1], ..., s[i], ..., s[l]>, the received 
   packets are represented as: 
    
                      \/ \/ 
   s = 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 
   i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 
                      /\ /\ 
    
   Considering Packet 5 first: 
   when j=5, 7 > 5, so the reordering extent is 1 or more. 
   when j=4, we have 4 < 5, so 1 is its maximum extent, and e=1. 
    
    
   Considering Packet 6 next: 
   when j=6, 5 < 6, the extent is not yet defined. 
   when j=5, 7 > 6, so the reordering extent is i-j=2 or more. 
   when j=4, 4 < 6, and we find 2 is its maximum extent, and e=2. 
    
   We can also associate each of these reordered packets with a 
   reordering discontinuity. We find the minimum j=5 (for both packets) 
   according to Section 4.2.3. So Packet 6 is associated with the same 
   reordering discontinuity as Packet 5, the Reordering Discontinuity 
   at Packet 7.  
    
   This is a case where reordering extent e would over-estimate the 
   packet storage required to restore order. Only one packet storage is 
   required (to hold Packet 7), but e=2 for Packet 6.  
    
   Following the definitions of section 5, Packet 5 is designated 1-
   reordered, but Packet 6 is not designated n-reordered. 
    
   A hypothetical sender/receiver pair may retransmit Packet 5 
   unnecessarily, since it is 1-reordered (in agreement with the 
   singleton metric). Though Packet 6 may not be unnecessarily 
   retransmitted, the receiver cannot advance Packet 7 to the higher 
   layers until after Packet 6 arrives. Therefore, the singleton metric 
   correctly determined that Packet 6 is reordered.

   The case in Table 3 is where three packets in sequence have long 
   transit times (Packets with s = 4,5,and 6). Delay, Late time, and 
   Byte Offset capture this very well, and indicate variation in 
   reordering extent, while IPDV indicates that the spacing between 
   packets 4,5,and 6 has changed. 
    
   The histogram of Reordering extents (e) would be: 
    
   Bin         1  2  3  4  5  6  7

   Using the notation <s[1], ..., s[i], ..., s[l]>, the received

   i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11 
    
    
   We first calculate the n-reordering. Considering Packet 4 first: 
   when n=1, 7<=j<8, and 10> 4, so the packet is 1-reordered. 
   when n=2, 6<=j<8, and 9 > 4, so the packet is 2-reordered. 
   when n=3, 5<=j<8, and 8 > 4, so the packet is 3-reordered. 
   when n=4, 4<=j<8, and 7 > 4, so the packet is 4-reordered. 
   when n=5, 3<=j<8, but 3 < 4, and 4 is the maximum n-reordering. 
 
   Considering packet 5[9] next: 
   when n=1, 8<=j<9, but 4 < 5, so the packet at i=9 is not designated 
   as n-reordered. We find the same to for Packet 6.  
    
   We now consider whether reordered Packets 5 and 6 are associated 
   with the same reordering discontinuity as Packet 4.  Using the test 
   of Section 4.2.3, we find that the minimum j=4 for all three 
   packets. They are all associated with the reordering discontinuity 
   at Packet 7.

   This example shows again that the n-reordering definition identifies 
   a single Packet (4) with a sufficient degree of n-reordering that 
   might cause one unnecessary packet retransmission by the New Reno 
   TCP sender (with DUP-ACK threshold=3 or 4). Also, the reordered 
   arrival of Packets 5 and 6 will allow the receiver process to pass 
   Packets 7 through 10 up the protocol stack (the singleton Type-P-
   Reordered = TRUE for Packets 5 and 6, and they are all associated 
   with a single reordering discontinuity).  
    
7.4 Example with Multiple Packet Reordering Discontinuities 
    
   Table 4 Example with Multiple Packet Reordering Discontinuities  
   Sending order(s @Src): 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 
    
          Discontinuity         Discontinuity 
                |---------Gap---------| 
   s = 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 11, 14, 15, 16 
   i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 
    
   r = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 1, 2,  3,  4,  5,  0,  1,  2,  3, ... 
   number of runs,n = 1  2                     3 
   end r counts =     5  0                     5     
   (these values are computed after the packet arrives) 
    
   Packet 4 has extent e=2, Packet 5 has extent e=3, and Packet 11 has 
   e=2. There are two different reordering discontinuities, one at 
   Packet 6 (where j=4) and one at Packet 12 (where j'=11). 
    
   According to the definition of Reordering Gap 
   Gap(s[j']) = (j') - (j)  
   Gap(Packet 12) = (11) - (4) = 7 
    
   We also have three reordering-free runs of lengths 5, 0, and 5. 
    
   The differences between these two multiple-event metrics are evident 
   here.  Gaps are the distance between sequence discontinuities that 
   are subsequently defined as reordering discontinuities, while 
   reordering-free runs capture the distance between reordered packets. 
    
    
8. Security Considerations  
 
8.1 Denial of Service Attacks  
 
   This metric requires a stream of packets sent from one host (source) 
   to another host (destination) through intervening networks.  This 
   method could be abused for denial of service attacks directed at 
   destination and/or the intervening network(s).  
    
   Administrators of source, destination, and the intervening 
   network(s) should establish bilateral or multi-lateral agreements 
  
Morton, et al.    Standards Track exp. October 2006           Page 28 
 
Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
   regarding the timing, size, and frequency of collection of sample 
   metrics.  Use of this method in excess of the terms agreed between 
   the participants may be cause for immediate rejection or discard of 
   packets or other escalation procedures defined between the affected 
   parties.  
    
8.2 User Data Confidentiality  
 
   Active use of this method generates packets for a sample, rather 
   than taking samples based on user data, and does not threaten user 
   data confidentiality. Passive measurement must restrict attention to 
   the headers of interest. Since user payloads may be temporarily 
   stored for length analysis, suitable precautions MUST be taken to 
   keep this information safe and confidential. In most cases, a 
   hashing function will produce a value suitable for payload 
   comparisons. 
    
8.3 Interference with the Metric  
 
   It may be possible to identify that a certain packet or stream of 
   packets is part of a sample. With that knowledge at the destination 
   and/or the intervening networks, it is possible to change the 
   processing of the packets (e.g. increasing or decreasing delay) that 
   may distort the measured performance.  It may also be possible to 
   generate additional packets that appear to be part of the sample 
   metric. These additional packets are likely to perturb the results 
   of the sample measurement.  
    
   To discourage the kind of interference mentioned above, packet 
   interference checks, such as cryptographic hash, may be used.  
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   Metrics defined in this memo SHOULD be registered in the IANA IPPM 
   METRICS REGISTRY as described in initial version of the registry 
   [RFC4148]. 
    
   IANA is asked to register the following metrics in the IANA-IPPM-
   METRICS-REGISTRY-MIB (where RFC xxxx is replaced with the number of 
   this memo):

14. Appendix B Fragment Order Evaluation (Informative) 
    
   Section 3 stated that fragment re-assembly is assumed prior to order 
   evaluation, but that similar procedures could be applied prior to 
   re-assembly.  This appendix gives definitions and procedures to 
   identify reordering in a packet stream that includes fragmentation.

Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
14.1 Metric Name 
    
   The Metric retains the same name, Type-P-Reordered, but additional 
   parameters are required.  
    
   This Appendix assumes that the device that divides a packet into 
   fragments send them according to ascending fragment offset. Early 
   Linux OS sent fragments in reverse order, so this possibility is 
   worth checking.  
    
14.2 Additional Metric Parameters 
    
   +  MoreFrag, the state of the More Fragments Flag in the IP header 
    
   +  FragOffset, the offset from the beginning of a fragmented packet, 
      in 8 octet units (also from the IP header). 
       
   +  FragSeq#, the sequence number from the IP header of a fragmented 
      packet currently under evaluation for reordering. When set to 
      zero, fragment evaluation is not in progress. 
    
   +  NextExpFrag, the Next Expected Fragment Offset at the 
      Destination, in 8 octet units. Set to zero when fragment 
      evaluation is not in progress. 
    
   The packet sequence number, s, is assumed to be the same as the IP 
   header sequence number. Also, the value of NextExp does not change   
   with the in-order arrival of fragments. NextExp is only updated when 
   a last fragment or a complete packet arrives. 
    
   Note that packets with missing fragments MUST be declared lost, and 
   the Reordering status of any fragments that do arrive MUST be 
   excluded from sample metrics. 
    
14.3 Definition 
    
   The value of Type-P-Reordered is typically false (the packet is in-
   order) when 
    
   * the sequence number s >= NextExp, 
    
   * AND the fragment offset FragOffset >= NextExpFrag 
    
   However, it more efficient to define reordered conditions exactly, 
   and designate Type-P-Reordered as False otherwise. 
    
   The value of Type-P-Reordered is defined as True (the packet is 
   reordered) under the conditions below. In these cases, the NextExp 
   value does not change. 
    
   Case 1: if s < NextExp

Packet Reordering Metric for IPPM                           April 2006 
 
 
    
   Case 2: if s < FragSeq#  
    
   Case 3: if s>= NextExp AND s = FragSeq# AND FragOffset < NextExpFrag 
    
   This definition can also be illustrated in pseudo-code. A version of 
   the code follows, and some simplification may be possible. A 
   challenging aspect surrounds the housekeeping for the new 
   parameters. 
    
   NextExp=0; 
   NextExpFrag=0; 
   FragSeq#=0; 
    
   while(packets arrive with s, MoreFrag, FragOffset) 
   { 
   if (s>=NextExp AND MoreFrag==0 AND s>=FragSeq#){ 
        /* a normal packet or last frag of an in-order packet arrived 
   */ 
        NextExp = s+1; 
        FragSeq# = 0; 
        NextExpFrag = 0; 
        Reordering = False; 
        } 
   if (s>=NextExp AND MoreFrag==1 AND s>FragSeq#>=0){ 
        /* a fragment of a new packet arrived, possibly with a 
        higher sequence number than the current fragmented packet */ 
        FragSeq# = s; 
        NextExpFrag = FragOffset+1; 
        Reordering = False; 
        } 
   if (s>=NextExp AND MoreFrag==1 AND s==FragSeq#){ 
        /* a fragment of the "current packet s" arrived */ 
        if (FragOffset >= NextExpFrag){ 
                NextExpFrag = FragOffset+1; 
                Reordering = False; 
                } 
        else{   
                Reordering = True; /* fragment reordered  */ 
                } 
        } 
   if (s>=NextExp AND MoreFrag==1 AND s < FragSeq#){ 
        /* case where a late fragment arrived,  
           for illustration only, redundant with else below */ 
        Reordering = True; 
        } 
   else { /* when s < NextExp, or MoreFrag==0 AND s < FragSeq# */ 
        Reordering = True; 
        } 
   }

   A working version of the code would include a check to ensure that 
   all fragments of a packet arrive before using the Reordered status 
   further, such as in sample metrics. 
    
14.4 Discussion: Notes on Sample Metrics when Evaluating Fragments 
    
   All fragments with the same Source Sequence Number are assigned the 
   same Source Time. 
    
   Evaluation with byte stream numbering may be simplified if the 
   fragment offset is simply added to the SourceByte of the first 
   packet (with fragment offset = 0), keeping the 8 octet units of the 
   offset in mind.
