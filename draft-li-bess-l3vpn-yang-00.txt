1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data definition language that was introduced to
   define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows networked
   devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is proving
   relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other interfaces
   (e.g.  ReST) and encodings other than XML (e.g.  JSON) are being
   defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the basis of
   implementation for other interfaces, such as CLI and programmatic
   APIs.

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage L3VPN (BGP/MPLS IP VPN) [RFC4364].

3.  Design of the L3VPN Model

3.1.  Overview

   The L3VPN Yang module is to augment the routing instance Yang models
   proposed by the draft [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].  It introduced
   the "l3vpn"container to define augmented parameters which can be
   applied for VRF Routing Instance and support both the IPv4 and IPv6
   address families.  The overview of the "l3vpn" container is shown in
   the following figure:

   module: ietf-l3vpn
   augment /rt:routing/rt:routing-instance:
      +--rw l3vpn
         +--rw ipv4-family
         |  +--rw bgp-parameters
         |  |  +--rw common
         |  |     +--rw route-distinguisher?   string
         |  |     +--rw vpn-targets* [rt-value]
         |  |        +--rw rt-value    string
         |  |        +--rw rt-type     bgp-rt-type
         |  ......
         +--rw ipv6-family
            +--rw bgp-parameters
            |  +--rw common
            |     +--rw route-distinguisher?   string
            |     +--rw vpn-targets* [rt-value]
            |        +--rw rt-value    string
            |        +--rw rt-type     bgp-rt-type
            ......

   L3VPN inteface parameters can reuse those parameters defined by
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].

   BGP Protocols parameters for L3VPN is defined by the draft
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].  The augment may be defined in the future
   version if necessary.

3.2.  VPN Instance Configuration

   An instance is created to comprise the VPN forwarding information for
   each VPN in a BGP/MPLS IP VPN.  This instance is called a VPN
   instance or a VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) table.  It is also
   called a per-site forwarding table in [RFC4364].  VPN instances must
   be created in all BGP/MPLS IP VPN solutions.  VPN instances support
   both the IPv4 and IPv6 address families.

   VPN instance configuration consists of the following components :

   o Per-Instance Configuration : that contains the common writable
   configuration objects for VPN instance IPv4 and IPv6 address family.

   o Address Family Configuration of L3VPN Instance: that contains the
   address family specific writable configuration objects.

3.2.1.  Per-Instance Configuration

   Per-instance parameters is defined by [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg]
   including instance name, description, etc.

3.2.2.  Address Family Configuration of L3VPN Instance

   l3vpn container contains the address family specific writable
   configuration objects, such as route-distinguisher, vpn-targets,
   apply-label-mode, etc.  The parameters should be consistent between
   IPv4 family and IPv6 family.
