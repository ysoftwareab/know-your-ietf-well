                  draft-veillette-core-yang-library-00

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG library that provides information
   about all the YANG modules used by a constrained network management
   server (e.g., a CoAP Management Interface (CoMI) server).  Simple
   caching mechanisms are provided to allow clients to minimize
   retrieval of this information.

1.  Introduction

   The YANG library specified in this document is available to clients
   of a given server to discover the YANG modules supported by this
   constrained network management server.  A CoMI server provides a link
   to this library in the /c/mod.uri resource.  The following YANG
   module information is provided to client applications to fully
   utilize the YANG data modeling language:

   o  module list: The list of YANG modules implemented by a server,
      each module is identified by its assigned YANG Schema Item
      iDentifier (SID) and revision.

   o  submodule list: The list of YANG submodules included by each
      module, each submodule is identified by its assigned SID and
      revision.

   o  feature list: The list of features supported by the server, each
      feature is identified by its assigned SID.

   o  deviation list: The list of YANG modules used for deviation
      statements associated with each YANG module, each module is
      identified by its assigned SID and revision.

Internet-Draft       Constrained YANG Module Library        January 2017


1.1.  Major differences between ietf-constrained-yang-library and ietf-
      yang-library

   YANG module ietf-constrained-yang-library targets the same
   functionality and shares the same approach as YANG module ietf-yang-
   library.  The following changes with respect to ietf-yang-library are
   specified to make ietf-constrained-yang-library compatible with SID
   [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] used by CoMI [I-D.vanderstok-core-comi] and
   to improve its applicability to constrained devices and networks.

   o  YANG module ietf-constrained-yang-library extends the caching
      mechanism supported by ietf-yang-library to multiple servers.
      This is accomplished by supporting the identityref datatype for
      "module-set-id".  This enables the use of a managed identifier
      (i.e. a SID) to identify a specific assembly of YANG modules,
      deviations and features implemented by a group of constrained
      servers.

   o  Modules, sub-modules, deviations and features are identified using
      a numerical value (SID) instead of a string (yang-identifier).

   o  The "namespace" leaf, not required for SIDs, but mandatory in
      ietf-yang-library is not included in ietf-constrained-yang-
      library.

   o  Schemas can be located using the already available module or sub-
      module identifier (SID) and revision.  For this reason, support of
      module and sub-module schema URIs have been removed.

   o To minimize their size, each revision date is encoded in binary.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950]:

   o  module

   o  submodule

   o  feature

   o  deviation

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor]:

Internet-Draft       Constrained YANG Module Library        January 2017


   o  YANG Schema Item iDentifier (SID)

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.vanderstok-core-comi]:

   o  client

   o  server

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  library: a collection of YANG modules used by a server.

3.  Overview

   The "ietf-constrained-yang-library" module provides information about
   the YANG library used by a given server.  This module is defined
   using YANG version 1 as defined by [RFC7950], but it supports the
   description of YANG modules written in any revision of YANG.

3.1.  Tree diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the YANG module specified in
   this document (ietf-constrained-yang-library) is provided below.  The
   meaning of the symbols in this diagram is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

3.2.  Description

3.2.1.  modules-state

   This mandatory container specifies the module set identifier and the
   list of modules supported by the server.

3.2.2.  modules-state/module-set-id

   This mandatory leaf contains an identifier representing the current
   set of modules and submodules used by a server.  This identifier is
   server-specific when implemented as unit32 or can be used by multiple
   servers when implemented as identityref.  The value of this leaf MUST
   change whenever the set of modules and submodules in the library
   changes.  There is no requirement that the same set always results in
   the same module-set-id value.

   This leaf allows a client to fetch the module list once, cache it,
   and only re-fetch it if the value of this leaf has been changed.

   If the value of this leaf changes, the server also generates a "yang-
   library-change" notification, with the new value of "module-set-id".

3.2.3.  modules-state/module

   This mandatory list contains one entry for each YANG module supported
   by the server.  There MUST be an entry in this list for each revision
   of each YANG module that is used by the server.  It is possible for
   multiple revisions of the same module to be imported, in addition to
   an entry for the revision that is implemented by the server.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  YANG Module Registry

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC7950].

   name: ietf-constrained-yang-library

   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-constrained-yang-library

   prefix: lib

   reference: RFC XXXX

   // RFC Ed.: replace XXXX with RFC number and remove this note

6.  Security Considerations

   This YANG module is designed to be accessed via the CoMI protocol
   [I-D.vanderstok-core-comi].  Some of the readable data nodes in this
   YANG module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  It is thus important to control read access to these
   data nodes.

   Specifically, the 'module' list may help an attacker to identify the
   server capabilities and server implementations with known bugs.
   Server vulnerabilities may be specific to particular modules, module
   revisions, module features, or even module deviations.  This
   information is included in each module entry.  For example, if a
   particular operation on a particular data node is known to cause a
   server to crash or significantly degrade device performance, then the
   module list information will help an attacker identify server
   implementations with such a defect, in order to launch a denial of
   service attack on the device.

7.  Acknowledgments

   The YANG module defined by this memo have been derived from an
   already existing YANG module, ietf-yang-library [RFC7895], we will
   like to thanks to the authors of this YANG module.  A special thank
   Andy Bierman for his initial recommendations for the creation of this
   YANG module.
