1.  Introduction

   This document defines an architecture, i.e., "XMPP-Grid", as a method
   for using the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
   [RFC6120] to collect and distribute security incident reports and
   other security-relevant information among network platforms,
   endpoints, and any other network-connected device, primarily for the
   purpose of communication among Computer Security Incident Response
   Teams and associated entities.  In effect, this document specifies an
   Applicability Statement ([RFC2026], Section 3.2) that defines how to
   use XMPP for the exchange of security notifications on a controlled-
   access network among authorized entities.

   Among other things, XMPP provides a publish-subscribe service
   [XEP-0060] that acts as a broker, enabling control-plane functions by
   which entities can discover available information to be published or
   consumed.  Although such information can take the form of any
   structured data (XML, JSON, etc.), this document illustrates the
   principles of XMPP-Grid with examples that use the Incident Object
   Description Exchange Format (IODEF) [RFC7970].  That is, while other

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   security information formats can be shared using XMPP, this document
   uses IODEF as one such example format that can be published and
   consumed using XMPP.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses XMPP terminology defined in [RFC6120] and
   [XEP-0060].  Because the intended audience for this document is those
   who implement and deploy security reporting systems, mappings are
   provided for the benefit of XMPP developers and operators.

   Broker:  A specific type of controller containing control plane
      functions; as used here, the term refers to an XMPP publish-
      subscribe service.

   Broker Flow:  A method by which security incident reports and other
      security-relevant information is published and consumed in a
      mediated fashion through a Broker.  In this flow, the Broker
      handles authorization of Consumers and Providers to Topics,
      receives messages from Providers, and delivers published messages
      to Consumers.

   Consumer:  An entity that contains functions to receive information
      from other components; as used here, the term refers to an XMPP
      publish-subscribe Subscriber.

   Controller:  A "component containing control plane functions that
      manage and facilitate information sharing or execute on security
      functions"; as used here, the term refers to an XMPP server, which
      provides core message delivery [RFC6120] used by publish-subscribe
      entities.

   Node:  The XMPP term for a Topic.

   Platform:  Any entity that connects to the XMPP-Grid in order to
      publish or consume security-relevant information.

   Provider:  An entity that contains functions to provide information
      to other components; as used here, the term refers to an XMPP
      publish-subscribe Publisher.

   Topic:  A contextual information channel created on a Broker at which
      messages generated by a Provider are propagated in real time to
      one or more Consumers.  Each Topic is limited to a specific type
      and format of security data (e.g.  IODEF namespace) and provides
      an XMPP interface by which the data can be obtained.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

   Platforms connect to the Controller (XMPP server) to authenticate and
   then establish appropriate authorizations to be a Provider or
   Consumer of topics of interest at the Broker.  The control plane
   messaging is established through XMPP and shown as "A" (control plane
   interface) in Figure 1.  Authorized Platforms can then share data
   either through the Broker (shown as "B" in Figure 1) or in some cases
   directly (shown as "C" in Figure 1).  This document focuses primarily
   on the Broker Flow for information sharing ("direct flow"
   interactions can be used for specialized purposes such as bulk data
   transfer, but methods for doing so are outside the scope of this
   document).

4.  Workflow

   Implementations of XMPP-Grid workflow adhere to the following
   workflow:

   a.  A Platform with a source of security data requests connection to
       the XMPP-Grid via a Controller.

   b.  The Controller authenticates the Platform.

   c.  The Platform establishes authorized privileges (e.g. privilege to
       publish and/or subscribe to one or more Topics) with a Broker.

   d.  The Platform can publish security incident reports and other
       security-relevant information to a Topic, subscribe to a Topic,
       query a Topic, or any combination of these operations.

   e.  A Provider unicasts its Topic updates to the Grid in real time
       through a Broker.  The Broker handles replication and
       distribution of the Topic to Consumers.  A Provider can publish
       the same or different data to multiple Topics.

   f.  Any Platform on the Grid can subscribe to any Topics published to
       the Grid (as permitted by authorization policy), and (as
       Consumers) will then receive a continual, real-time stream of
       updates from the Topics to which it is subscribed.

   The general workflow is summarized in the figure below:

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   XMPP-Grid implementations MUST adhere to the mandatory-to-implement
   and mandatory-to-negotiate features as defined in [RFC6120].
   Similarly, implementations MUST implement [XEP-0060] to facilitate
   the asynchronous sharing for information.  Implementations SHOULD
   implement Service Discovery as defined in [XEP-0030] to facilitate
   the means to dynamically discover the available information and
   namespaces (Topics) to be published or consumed.  Implementations
   should take caution if their deployments allow for a large number of
   topics.  The Result Set Management as defined in [XEP-0059], SHOULD
   be used to allow the requesting entity to explicitly request Service
   Discovery result sets to be returned in pages or limited size, if the
   discovery results are larger in size.  Note that the control plane
   may optionally also implement [XEP-0203] to facilitate delayed
   delivery of messages to the connected consumer as described in
   [XEP-0060].  Since information may be timely and sensitive,
   capability providers should communicate to the controller whether its
   messages can be cached for delayed delivery during configuration;
   such function is out of scope for this document.

   The following sections provide protocol examples for the service
   discovery and publish-subscribe parts of the workflow.

5.  Service Discovery

   Using the XMPP service discovery extension [XEP-0030], a Controller
   enables Platforms to discover what information can be consumed
   through the Broker, and at which Topics.  Platforms could use
   [XEP-0059] to restrict the size of the result sets the Controller
   returns in Service Discovery response.  As an example, the Controller
   at 'security-grid.example' might provide a Broker at
   'broker.security-grid.example' hosting a number of Topics.  A
   Platform at 'xmpp-grid-client@mile-host.example' would query the
   Broker about its available Topics by sending an XMPP "disco#items"
   request to the Broker:

   <iq type='get'

             name='MILE Host Data'
             jid='broker.security-grid.example'/>
     </query>
   </iq>

   In order to determine the exact nature of each Topic (i.e., in order
   to find topics that publish incidents in the IODEF format), a
   Platform would send an XMPP "disco#info" request to each Topic:

   <iq type='get'
       from='xmpp-grid-client@mile-host.example/2EBE702A97D6'
       to='broker.security-grid.example'

     <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'
            node='MILEHost'/>
   </iq>

   The Broker responds with the "disco#info" description, which MUST
   include an XMPP Data Form [XEP-0004] including a 'pubsub#type' field
   that specifies the supported namespace (in this example, the IODEF
   namespace defined in [RFC7970]):

    </query>
  </iq>

   The Platform discovers the topics by obtaining the Broker's response
   and obtaining the namespaces returned in the "pubsub#type" field (in
   the foregoing example, IODEF 2.0).

6.  Publish-Subscribe

   Using the XMPP publish-subscribe extension [XEP-0060], a Consumer
   subscribes to a Topic and a Provider publishes information to that
   Topic, which the Broker then distributes to all subscribed Consumers.

   First, a Provider would create a Topic as follows:

   <iq type='set'
       from='datasource@provider.example/F12C2EFC9BB0'
       to='broker.security-grid.example'
       id='A67507DF-2F22-4937-8D30-88D2F7DBA279'>
     <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
       <create node='MILEHost'/>
     </pubsub>
   </iq>

   Note: The foregoing example is the minimal protocol needed to create
   a Topic with the default node configuration on the XMPP publish-
   subscribe service specified in the 'to' address of the creation
   request stanza.  Depending on security requirements, the Provider
   might need to request a non-default configuration for the node; see
   [XEP-0060] for detailed examples.  To also help with the Topic
   configuration, the Provider may also optionally include
   configurations parameters such as:



Cam-Winget, et al.     Expires September 28, 2019               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


  <configure>
    <x xmlns='jabber:x:data' type='submit'>
      <field var='FORM_TYPE' type='hidden'>
        <value>http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#node_config</value>
      </field>
      <field var='pubsub#access_model'><value>authorize</value></field>
      <field var='pubsub#persist_items'><value>1</value></field>
      <field var='pubsub#send_last_published_item'><value>never</value></field>
    </x>
  </configure>

   The above configuration indicates the Topic is configured to enable
   the XMPP-Controller to manage the subscriptions, be in persistent
   mode and disables the Broker from cacheing the last item published.
   Please refer to [XEP-0060] a more detailed description of these
   configuration and other available configuration options.

   Unless an error occurs (see [XEP-0060] for various error flows), the
   Broker responds with success:

   <iq type='result'
       from='broker.security-grid.example'
       to='datasource@provider.example/F12C2EFC9BB0'
       id='A67507DF-2F22-4937-8D30-88D2F7DBA279'/>

   Second, a Consumer would subscribe as follows:

   <iq type='set'
       from='xmpp-grid-client@mile-host.example/2EBE702A97D6'
       to='broker.security-grid.example'
       id='9C6EEE9E-F09A-4418-8D68-3BA6AF852522'>
     <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
       <subscribe node='MILEHost'
                  jid='xmpp-grid-client@mile-host.example'/>
     </pubsub>
   </iq>

   Unless an error occurs (see [XEP-0060] for various error flows), the
   Broker responds with success:

           jid='xmpp-grid-client@mile-host.example'
           subscription='subscribed'/>
     </pubsub>
   </iq>

   Third, a Provider would publish an incident to the broker using the
   MILEHost topic as follows:

  <iq type='set'
      from='datasource@provider.example/F12C2EFC9BB0'
      to='broker.security-grid.example'
      id='2A17D283-0DAE-4A6C-85A9-C10B1B40928C'>
    <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
      <publish node='MILEHost'>
        <item id='8bh1g27skbga47fh9wk7'>

            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation=
              "http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/
               schema/iodef-2.0.xsd">
            <Incident purpose="reporting" restriction="private">
              <IncidentID name="csirt.example.com">492382</IncidentID>
              <GenerationTime>2015-07-18T09:00:00-05:00</GenerationTime>
              <Contact type="organization" role="creator">
                <Email>
                  <EmailTo>contact@csirt.example.com</EmailTo>
                </Email>
              </Contact>
            </Incident>
          </IODEF-Document>
        </item>
      </publish>
    </pubsub>
  </iq>

   (The payload in the foregoing example is from [RFC7970]; payloads for
   additional use cases can be found in [RFC8274].)

   The Broker would then deliver that incident report to all Consumers
   who are subscribed to the Topic:

   Note that [XEP-0060] uses the XMPP "<message />" stanza for delivery
   of content.  To ensure that messages are delivered to the Consumer
   even if the Consumer is not online at the same time that the
   Publisher generates the message, an XMPP-Grid Controller MUST support
   "offline messaging" delivery semantics as specified in [RFC6121],
   best practices for which are further explained in [XEP-0160].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   An XMPP-Grid Controller serves as an controlling broker for XMPP-Grid
   Platforms such as Enforcement Points, Policy Servers, CMDBs, and
   Sensors, using a publish-subscribe-search model of information
   exchange and lookup.  By increasing the ability of XMPP-Grid
   Platforms to learn about and respond to security incident reports and
   other security-relevant information, XMPP-Grid can improve the
   timeliness and utility of the security system.  However, this



Cam-Winget, et al.     Expires September 28, 2019              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   integrated security system can also be exploited by attackers if they
   can compromise it.  Therefore, strong security protections for XMPP-
   Grid are essential.

   As XMPP is the core of this document, the security considerations of
   [RFC6120] applies.  In addition, as XMPP-Grid defines a specific
   instance, this section provides a security analysis of the XMPP-Grid
   data transfer protocol and the architectural elements that employ it,
   specifically with respect to their use of this protocol.  Three
   subsections define the trust model (which elements are trusted to do
   what), the threat model (attacks that can be mounted on the system),
   and the countermeasures (ways to address or mitigate the threats
   previously identified).

8.1.  Trust Model

   The first step in analyzing the security of the XMPP-Grid transport
   protocol is to describe the trust model, listing what each
   architectural element is trusted to do.  The items listed here are
   assumptions, but provisions are made in the Threat Model and
   Countermeasures sections for elements that fail to perform as they
   were trusted to do.

8.1.1.  Network

   The network used to carry XMPP-Grid messages (i.e., the underlying
   network transport layer over which XMPP runs) is trusted to:

   o  Perform best effort delivery of network traffic

   The network used to carry XMPP-Grid messages is not expected
   (trusted) to:

   o  Provide confidentiality or integrity protection for messages sent
      over it

   o  Provide timely or reliable service

8.1.2.  XMPP-Grid Platforms

   Authorized XMPP-Grid Platforms are trusted to:

   o  Preserve the confidentiality of sensitive data retrieved via the
      XMPP-Grid Controller

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


8.1.3.  XMPP-Grid Controller

   The XMPP-Grid Controller (including its associated Broker) is trusted
   to:

   o  Broker requests for data and enforce authorization of access to
      this data throughout its lifecycle

   o  Perform service requests in a timely and accurate manner

   o  Create and maintain accurate operational attributes

   o  Only reveal data to and accept service requests from authorized
      parties

   o  Preserve the integrity (and confidentiality against unauthorized
      parties) of the data flowing through it.

   The XMPP-Grid Controller is not expected (trusted) to:

   o  Verify the truth (correctness) of data

8.1.4.  Certification Authority

   To allow XMPP-Grid Platforms to mutually authenticate with XMPP-Grid
   Controllers, it is expected that a Certification Authority (CA) is
   employed to issue certificates.  Such a CA (or each CA, if there are
   several) is trusted to:

   o  Ensure that only proper certificates are issued and that all
      certificates are issued in accordance with the CA's policies

   o  Revoke certificates previously issued when necessary

   o  Regularly and securely distribute certificate revocation
      information

   o  Promptly detect and report any violations of this trust so that
      they can be handled

   The CA is not expected (trusted) to:

   o  Issue certificates that go beyond the XMPP-Grid needs or other
      constraints imposed by a relying party.

8.2.  Threat Model

   To secure the XMPP-Grid data transfer protocol and the architectural
   elements that implement it, this section identifies the attacks that
   can be mounted against the protocol and elements.

8.2.1.  Network Attacks

   A variety of attacks can be mounted using the network.  For the
   purposes of this subsection the phrase "network traffic" can be taken
   to mean messages and/or parts of messages.  Any of these attacks can
   be mounted by network elements, by parties who control network
   elements, and (in many cases) by parties who control network-attached
   devices.

   o  Network traffic can be passively monitored to glean information
      from any unencrypted traffic

   o  Even if all traffic is encrypted, valuable information can be
      gained by traffic analysis (volume, timing, source and destination
      addresses, etc.)

   o  Network traffic can be modified in transit

   o  Previously transmitted network traffic can be replayed

   o  New network traffic can be added

   o  Network traffic can be blocked, perhaps selectively

   o  A "Man In The Middle" (MITM) attack can be mounted where an
      attacker interposes itself between two communicating parties and
      poses as the other end to either party or impersonates the other
      end to either or both parties

   o  Undesired network traffic can be sent in an effort to overload an
      architectural component, thus mounting a denial of service attack

8.2.2.  XMPP-Grid Platforms

   An unauthorized XMPP-Grid Platform (one which is not recognized by
   the XMPP-Grid Controller or is recognized but not authorized to
   perform any actions) cannot mount any attacks other than those listed
   in the Network Attacks section above.

   An authorized XMPP-Grid Platform, on the other hand, can mount many
   attacks.  These attacks might occur because the XMPP-Grid Platform is
   controlled by a malicious, careless, or incompetent party (whether



Cam-Winget, et al.     Expires September 28, 2019              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   because its owner is malicious, careless, or incompetent or because
   the XMPP-Grid Platform has been compromised and is now controlled by
   a party other than its owner).  They might also occur because the
   XMPP-Grid Platform is running malicious software; because the XMPP-
   Grid Platform is running buggy software (which can fail in a state
   that floods the network with traffic); or because the XMPP-Grid
   Platform has been configured improperly.  From a security standpoint,
   it generally makes no difference why an attack is initiated.  The
   same countermeasures can be employed in any case.

   Here is a list of attacks that can be mounted by an authorized XMPP-
   Grid Platform:

   o  Cause many false alarms or otherwise overload the XMPP-Grid
      Controller or other elements in the network security system
      (including human administrators) leading to a denial of service or
      disabling parts of the network security system

   o  Omit important actions (such as posting incriminating data),
      resulting in incorrect access

   o  Use confidential information obtained from the XMPP-Grid
      Controller to enable further attacks (such as using endpoint
      health check results to exploit vulnerable endpoints)

   o  Advertise data crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the XMPP-Grid
      Controller or in other XMPP-Grid Platforms, with a goal of
      compromising those systems

   o  Issue a search request or set up a subscription that matches an
      enormous result, leading to resource exhaustion on the XMPP-Grid
      Controller, the publishing XMPP-Grid Platform, and/or the network

   o  Establish a communication channel using another XMPP-Grid
      Platform's session-id

   o  Advertise false data that leads to incorrect (e.g., potentially
      attacker-controlled or -induced) behavior of XMPP-Grid Platforms,
      by virtue of applying correct procdeures to the falsified input.

   Dependencies of or vulnerabilities of authorized XMPP-Grid Platforms
   can be exploited to effect these attacks.  Another way to effect
   these attacks is to gain the ability to impersonate an XMPP-Grid
   Platform (through theft of the XMPP-Grid Platform's identity
   credentials or through other means).  Even a clock skew between the
   XMPP-Grid Platform and XMPP-Grid Controller can cause problems if the
   XMPP-Grid Platform assumes that old XMPP-Grid Platform data should be
   ignored.

8.2.3.  XMPP-Grid Controllers

   An unauthorized XMPP-Grid Controller (one which is not trusted by
   XMPP-Grid Platforms) cannot mount any attacks other than those listed
   in the Network Attacks section above.

   An authorized XMPP-Grid Controller can mount many attacks.  Similar
   to the XMPP-Grid Platform case described above, these attacks might
   occur because the XMPP-Grid Controller is controlled by a malicious,
   careless, or incompetent party (either an XMPP-Grid Controller
   administrator or an attacker who has seized control of the XMPP-Grid
   Controller).  They might also occur because the XMPP-Grid Controller
   is running malicious software, because the XMPP-Grid Controller is
   running buggy software (which can fail in a state that corrupts data
   or floods the network with traffic), or because the XMPP-Grid
   Controller has been configured improperly.

   All of the attacks listed for XMPP-Grid Platform above can be mounted
   by the XMPP-Grid Controller.  Detection of these attacks will be more
   difficult since the XMPP-Grid Controller can create false operational
   attributes and/or logs that imply some other party created any bad
   data.

   Additional XMPP-Grid Controller attacks can include:

   o  Expose different data to different XMPP-Grid Platforms to mislead
      investigators or cause inconsistent behavior

   o  Mount an even more effective denial of service attack than a
      single XMPP-Grid Platform could; some mechanisms include inducing
      the many platforms to perform the same operation in an
      amplification-style attack, completely refusing to pass any
      traffic at all, or sending floods of traffic to (certain)
      platforms or other targets.

   o  Obtain and cache XMPP-Grid Platform credentials so they can be
      used to impersonate XMPP-Grid Platforms even after a breach of the
      XMPP-Grid Controller is repaired.  Some SASL mechanisms (including
      the mandatory-to-implement SCRAM and EXTERNAL with TLS mutual
      certificate-based authentication) do not admit this class of
      attack, but others (such as PLAIN) are susceptible.

   o  Obtain and cache XMPP-Grid Controller administrator credentials so
      they can be used to regain control of the XMPP-Grid Controller
      after the breach of the XMPP-Grid Controller is repaired.

   o  Eavesdrop, inject or modify the data being transferred between
      provider and consumer

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   Dependencies of or vulnerabilities of the XMPP-Grid Controller can be
   exploited to obtain control of the XMPP-Grid Controller and effect
   these attacks.

8.2.4.  Certification Authority

   A Certification Authority trusted to issue certificates for the XMPP-
   Grid Controller and/or XMPP-Grid Platforms can mount several attacks:

   o  Issue certificates for unauthorized parties, enabling them to
      impersonate authorized parties such as the XMPP-Grid Controller or
      an XMPP-Grid Platform.  This can lead to all the threats that can
      be mounted by the certificate's subject.

   o  Issue certificates without following all of the CA's policies.
      Because this can result in issuing certificates that can be used
      to impersonate authorized parties, this can lead to all the
      threats that can be mounted by the certificate's subject.

   o  Fail to revoke previously issued certificates that need to be
      revoked.  This can lead to undetected impersonation of the
      certificate's subject or failure to revoke authorization of the
      subject, and therefore can lead to all of the threats that can be
      mounted by that subject.

   o  Fail to regularly and securely distribute certificate revocation
      information.  This can cause a relying party to accept a revoked
      certificate, leading to undetected impersonation of the
      certificate's subject or failure to revoke authorization of the
      subject, and therefore can lead to all of the threats that can be
      mounted by that subject.  It can also cause a relying party to
      refuse to proceed with a transaction because timely revocation
      information is not available, even though the transaction should
      be permitted to proceed.

   o  Allow the CA's private key to be revealed to an unauthorized
      party.  This can lead to all the threats above.  Even worse, the
      actions taken with the private key will not be known to the CA.

   o  Fail to promptly detect and report errors and violations of trust
      so that relying parties can be promptly notified.  This can cause
      the threats listed earlier in this section to persist longer than
      necessary, leading to many knock-on effects.

8.3.  Countermeasures

   Below are countermeasures for specific attack scenarios to the XMPP-
   Grid infrastructure.

8.3.1.  Securing the XMPP-Grid Data Transfer Protocol

   To address network attacks, the XMPP-Grid data transfer protocol
   described in this document requires that the XMPP-Grid messages MUST
   be carried over TLS (minimally TLS 1.2 and preferrably TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446]) as described in [RFC6120] and updated by [RFC7590].  The
   XMPP-Grid Controller and XMPP-Grid Platforms SHOULD mutually
   authenticate.  The XMPP-Grid Platform MUST verify the XMPP-Grid
   Controller's certificate and determine whether the XMPP-Grid
   Controller is trusted by this XMPP-Grid Platform before completing
   the TLS handshake.  To ensure interoperability, implementations MUST
   implement at least one of either the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism
   [RFC4422] or the SASL SCRAM mechanism.  When using the SASL SCRAM
   mechanism, the SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS variant SHOULD be preferred over
   the SCRAM-SHA-256 variant; and SHA-256 variants [RFC7677] SHOULD be
   preferred over SHA-1 variants [RFC5802]).  XMPP-Grid Platforms and
   XMPP-Grid Controllers using certificate-based authentication SHOULD
   each verify the revocation status of the other party's certificate.
   The selection of which XMPP-Grid Platform authentication technique to
   use in any particular deployment is left to the administrator.

   These protocol security measures provide protection against all the
   network attacks listed in the above document section except denial of
   service attacks.  If protection against these denial of service
   attacks is desired, ingress filtering, rate limiting per source IP
   address, and other denial of service mitigation measures can be
   employed.  In addition, an XMPP-Grid Controller MAY automatically
   disable a misbehaving XMPP-Grid Platform.

8.3.2.  Securing XMPP-Grid Platforms

   XMPP-Grid Platforms can be deployed in locations that are susceptible
   to physical attacks.  Physical security measures can be taken to
   avoid compromise of XMPP-Grid Platforms, but these are not always
   practical or completely effective.  An alternative measure is to
   configure the XMPP-Grid Controller to provide read-only access for
   such systems.  The XMPP-Grid Controller SHOULD also include a full
   authorization model so that individual XMPP-Grid Platforms can be
   configured to have only the privileges that they need.  The XMPP-Grid
   Controller MAY provide functional templates so that the administrator
   can configure a specific XMPP-Grid Platform as a DHCP [RFC2131]
   server and authorize only the operations and metadata types needed by
   a DHCP server to be permitted for that XMPP-Grid Platform.  These



Cam-Winget, et al.     Expires September 28, 2019              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   techniques can reduce the negative impacts of a compromised XMPP-Grid
   Platform without diminishing the utility of the overall system.

   To handle attacks within the bounds of this authorization model, the
   XMPP-Grid Controller MAY also include rate limits and alerts for
   unusual XMPP-Grid Platform behavior.  XMPP-Grid Controllers SHOULD
   make it easy to revoke an XMPP-Grid Platform's authorization when
   necessary.  The XMPP-Grid Controller SHOULD include auditable logs of
   XMPP-Grid Platform activities.

   To avoid compromise of XMPP-Grid Platform, XMPP-Grid Platform SHOULD
   be hardened against attack and minimized to reduce their attack
   surface.  They should be well managed to minimize vulnerabilities in
   the underlying platform and in systems upon which the XMPP-Grid
   Platform depends.  Personnel with administrative access should be
   carefully screened and monitored to detect problems as soon as
   possible.

8.3.3.  Securing XMPP-Grid Controllers

   Because of the serious consequences of XMPP-Grid Controller
   compromise, XMPP-Grid Controllers need to be especially well hardened
   against attack and minimized to reduce their attack surface.  They
   need to be well managed to minimize vulnerabilities in the underlying
   platform and in systems upon which the XMPP-Grid Controller depends.
   Network security measures such as firewalls or intrusion detection
   systems can be used to monitor and limit traffic to and from the
   XMPP-Grid Controller.  Personnel with administrative access ought to
   be carefully screened and monitored to detect problems as soon as
   possible.  Administrators SHOULD NOT use password-based
   authentication but SHOULD instead use non-reusable credentials and
   multi-factor authentication (where available).  Physical security
   measures ought to be employed to prevent physical attacks on XMPP-
   Grid Controllers.

   To ease detection of XMPP-Grid Controller compromise should it occur,
   XMPP-Grid Controller behavior should be monitored to detect unusual
   behavior (such as a reboot, a large increase in traffic, or different
   views of an information repository for similar XMPP-Grid Platforms).
   It is a matter of local policy whether XMPP-Grid Platforms log and/or
   notify administrators when peculiar XMPP-Grid Controller behavior is
   detected, and whether read-only audit logs of security-relevant
   information (especially administrative actions) are maintained;
   however, such behavior is encouraged to aid in forensic analysis.
   Furthermore, if compromise of an XMPP-Grid Controller is detected, a
   careful analysis should be performed and any reusable credentials
   that can have been compromised should be reissued.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   To address the potential for the XMPP-Grid controller to eavesdrop,
   modify or inject data, it would be desirable to deploy end-to-end
   encryption between the provider and the consumer(s).  Unfortunately,
   because there is no standardized method for encryption of one-to-many
   messages within XMPP, techniques for enforcing end-to-end encryption
   are out of scope for this specification.

8.3.4.  Broker Access Models for Topics

   The XMPP publish-subscribe specification [XEP-0060] defines five
   access models for subscribing to Topics at a Broker: open, presence,
   roster, authorize, and whitelist.  The first model allows
   uncontrolled access and the next two models are appropriate only in
   instant-messaging applications.  Therefore, a Broker SHOULD support
   only the authorize model (under which the Topic owner needs to
   approve all subscription requests and only subscribers can retrieve
   data items) and the whitelist model (under which only preconfigured
   Platforms can subscribe or retrieve data items).  In order to ease
   the deployment burden, subscription approvals and whitelist
   management can be automated (e.g, the Topic "owner" can be a policy
   server).  The choice between "authorize" and "whitelist" as the
   default access model is a matter for local service policy.

8.3.5.  Limit on Search Result Size

   While XMPP-Grid is designed for high scalability to 100,000s of
   Platforms, an XMPP-Grid Controller MAY establish a limit to the
   amount of data it is willing to return in search or subscription
   results.  Platforms could use [XEP-0059] to restrict the size of the
   result sets the Controller returns in search or subscription results
   or topics' service discovery.  This mitigates the threat of an XMPP-
   Grid Platform causing resource exhaustion by issuing a search or
   subscription that leads to an enormous result.

8.3.6.  Securing the Certification Authority

   As noted above, compromise of a Certification Authority (CA) trusted
   to issue certificates for the XMPP-Grid Controller and/or XMPP-Grid
   Platforms is a major security breach.  Many guidelines for proper CA
   security have been developed: the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline
   Requirements, the AICPA/CICA Trust Service Principles, the IETF's
   Certificate Transparency [RFC6962] etc.  The CA operator and relying
   parties should agree on an appropriately rigorous security practices
   to be used.

   Even with the most rigorous security practices, a CA can be
   compromised.  If this compromise is detected quickly, relying parties
   can remove the CA from their list of trusted CAs, and other CAs can



Cam-Winget, et al.     Expires September 28, 2019              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   revoke any certificates issued to the CA.  However, CA compromise may
   go undetected for some time, and there's always the possibility that
   a CA is being operated improperly or in a manner that is not in the
   interests of the relying parties.  For this reason, relying parties
   may wish to "pin" a small number of particularly critical
   certificates (such as the certificate for the XMPP-Grid Controller).
   Once a certificate has been pinned, the relying party will not accept
   another certificate in its place unless the Administrator explicitly
   commands it to do so.  This does not mean that the relying party will
   not check the revocation status of pinned certificates.  However, the
   Administrator can still be consulted if a pinned certificate is
   revoked, since the CA and revocation process are not completely
   trusted.  By "pinning" one or a small set of certificates, the
   relying party has the effective XMPP-Grid Controller(s) authorized to
   connect to.

8.3.7.  End-to-End Encryption of Messages

   Because it is expected that there will be a relatively large number
   of Consumers for every Topic, for purposes of content discovery and
   scaling this document specifies a "one-to-many" communications
   pattern using the XMPP Publish-Subscribe extension.  Unfortunately,
   there is no standardized technology for end-to-end encryption of one-
   to-many messages in XMPP.  This implies that messages can be subject
   to eavesdropping, data injection, and data modification attacks
   within a Broker or Controller.  If it is necessary to mitigate
   against such attacks, implementers would need to select a messaging
   pattern other than [XEP-0060], most likely the basic "instant
   messaging" pattern specified in [RFC6121] with a suitable XMPP
   extension for end-to-end encryption (such as [RFC3923] or a more
   modern method such as [XEP-0384]).  The description of such an
   approach is out of scope for this document.

8.4.  Summary

   XMPP-Grid's considerable value as a broker for security-sensitive
   data exchange distribution also makes the protocol and the network
   security elements that implement it a target for attack.  Therefore,
   strong security has been included as a basic design principle within
   the XMPP-Grid design process.

   The XMPP-Grid data transfer protocol provides strong protection
   against a variety of different attacks.  In the event that an XMPP-
   Grid Platform or XMPP-Grid Controller is compromised, the effects of
   this compromise have been reduced and limited with the recommended
   role-based authorization model and other provisions, and best
   practices for managing and protecting XMPP-Grid systems have been
   described.  Taken together, these measures should provide protection

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


   commensurate with the threat to XMPP-Grid systems, thus ensuring that
   they fulfill their promise as a network security clearing-house.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   XMPP-Grid Platforms can publish information about endpoint health,
   network access, events (which can include information about what
   services an endpoint is accessing), roles and capabilities, and the
   identity of the end user operating the endpoint.  Any of this
   published information can be queried by other XMPP-Grid Platforms and
   could potentially be used to correlate network activity to a
   particular end user.

   Dynamic and static information brokered by an XMPP-Grid Controller,
   ostensibly for purposes of correlation by XMPP-Grid Platforms for
   intrusion detection, could be misused by a broader set of XMPP-Grid
   Platforms which hitherto have been performing specific roles with
   strict well-defined separation of duties.

   Care needs to be taken by deployers of XMPP-Grid to ensure that the
   information published by XMPP-Grid Platforms does not violate
   agreements with end users or local and regional laws and regulations.
   This can be accomplished either by configuring XMPP-Grid Platforms to
   not publish certain information or by restricting access to sensitive
   data to trusted XMPP-Grid Platforms.  That is, the easiest means to
   ensure privacy or protect sensitive data, is to omit or not share it
   at all.

   Similarly, care must be taken by deployers and XMPP-Grid Controller
   implementations as they implement the appropriate auditing tools.  In
   particular, any information, such as logs must be sensitive to the
   type of information stored to ensure that the information does not
   violate privacy and agreements with end users or local and regional
   laws and regulations.

   Another consideration for deployers is to enable end-to-end
   encryption to ensure the data is protected from the data layer to
   data layer and thus protect it from the transport layer.  The means
   to achieve end-to-end encrpytion is beyond the scope of this
   document.

10.  Operations and Management Considerations

   In order to facilitate the management of Providers and the onboarding
   of Consumers, it is helpful to generate the following ahead of time:

   o  Agreement between the operators of Provider services and the
      implementers of Consumer software regarding identifiers for common



Cam-Winget, et al.     Expires September 28, 2019              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP Grid                     March 2019


      Topics (e.g., these could be registered with the XMPP Software
      Foundation's registry of well-known nodes for service discovery
      and publish-subscribe located at <https://xmpp.org/registrar/
      nodes.html>).

   o  Security certificates (including appropriate certificate chains)
      for Controllers, including identification of any Providers
      associated with the Controllers (which might be located at
      subdomains).

   o  Consistent and secure access control policies for publishing and
      subscribing to Topics.

   These matters are out of scope for this document but ought to be
   addressed by the XMPP-Grid community.
