Abstract

   In large multicast groups, the size of the group membership table
   maintained by RTP (Real Time Transport Protocol) participants may
   become unwieldy, particularly for embedded devices with limited
   memory and processing power. This document discusses mechanisms for
   sampling of this group membership table in order to reduce the memory
   requirements. Several mechanisms are proposed, and the performance of
   each is considered.


1 Introduction



J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne                                  [Page 1]


Internet Draft                RTP Sampling                 July 20, 1999


   RTP, the Real Time Transport protocol [1], mandates that RTCP packets
   be transmitted from each participant with a period roughly
   proportional to the group size. The group size is obtained by storing
   a table, containing an entry for each unique SSRC seen in RTP and
   RTCP packets. As members leave or time out, entries are deleted, and
   as new members join, entries are added. The table is thus highly
   dynamic.

   For large multicast sessions, such as an mbone broadcast or IP based
   TV distribution, group sizes can be extremely large, on the order of
   hundreds of thousands to millions of participants. In these
   environments, RTCP may not always be used, and thus the group
   membership table isn't needed. However, it is highly desirable for
   RTP to scale well for groups with one member to groups with one
   million members, without human intervention to "turn off" RTCP when
   its no longer appropriate. This means that the same tools and systems
   can be used for both small conferences and TV broadcasts in a smooth,
   scalable fashion.

   Previous work [2] has identified three major scalability problems
   with RTP. These are:

        1.   Congestion due to floods of RTCP packets in highly dynamic
             groups

        2.   Large delays between receipt of RTCP packets from a single
             user

        3.   Large size of the group membership table

   The reconsideration algorithm [2] helps to alleviate the first of
   these. This document addresses the third, that of large group size
   tables.

   Storage of an SSRC table with one million members, for example,
   requires at least four megabytes. As a result, embedded devices with
   small memory footprints may have difficulty under these conditions.
   To solve this problem, SSRC sampling has been proposed. SSRC sampling
   uses statistical sampling to obtain a stochastic estimate of the
   group membership. There are many issues that arise when this is done.
   This document reviews these issues and discusses the mechanisms which
   can be applied by implementors.

2 Basic Operation

   The basic idea behind SSRC sampling is simple. Each participant
   maintains a key K of 32 bits, and a mask M of 32 bits. Assume that m
   of the bits in the mask are 1, and the remainder are zero. When an



J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne                                  [Page 2]


Internet Draft                RTP Sampling                 July 20, 1999


   RTCP packet arrives with some SSRC S, rather than placing it in the
   table, it is first sampled. The sampling is performed by ANDing the
   key and the mask, and also ANDing the SSRC and the mask. The
   resulting values are compared. If equal, the SSRC is stored in the
   table. If not equal, the SSRC is rejected, and the packet is treated
   as if it were never received.

   The key can be anything, but is usually chosen to be the SSRC of the
   user who is performing the sampling.

   This sampling process can be described mathematically as:

   D = (K*M == S*M)


   Where the * operator denotes AND and the == operator denotes a test
   for equality. D represents the sampling decision.

   According to the RTP specification, the SSRC's used by session
   participants are chosen randomly. If the distribution is also
   uniform, it is easy to see that the above filtering will cause 1 out
   of 2**m SSRC's to be placed in the table, where m is the number of
   bits in the mask, M, which are one. Thus, the sampling probability p
   is 2**-m.

   Then, to obtain an actual group size estimate, L, the number of
   entries in the table N is multiplied by 2**m:


   L = N * 2**m



   Care must be taken when choosing which bits to set to 1 in the mask.
   Although the RTP specification mandates randomly chosen SSRC, there
   are many known implementations which do not conform to this. In
   particular, the ITU H.323 [3] series of recommendations allows the
   central control element, the gatekeeper, to assign the least
   significant 8 bits of the SSRC, while the most significant are
   randomly chosen by RTP participants.

   The safest way to handle this problem is to first hash the SSRC using
   a cryptographically secure hash, such as MD5 [4], and then choose 32
   of the bits in the result as the SSRC used in the above computation.
   This provides much better randomness, and doesn't require detailed
   knowledge about how various implementations actually set the SSRC.

2.1 Performance



J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne                                  [Page 3]


Internet Draft                RTP Sampling                 July 20, 1999


   The estimate is more accurate as the value of m decreases, less
   accurate as it increases. This can be demonstrated analytically. If
   the actual group size is G, the standard deviation to mean of the
   estimate L (coefficient of variation) is:


   sqrt((2**m - 1)/G)



   This equation can be used as a guide for selecting the thresholds for
   when to change the sampling factor, as discussed below. For example,
   if the target is a 1% standard deviation to mean, the sampling
   probability p=2**-m should be no smaller than .5 when there are ten
   thousand group members. More generally, to achieve a desired standard
   deviation to mean ration of T, the sampling probability should be no
   less than:


   p > 1 / (1 + G*(T**2))



3 Increasing the Sampling Probability

   The above simple sampling procedure would work fine if the group size
   was static. However, it is not. A participant joining an RTP session
   will initially see just one participant (themselves). As packets are
   received, the group size as seen by that participant will increase.
   To handle this, the sampling probability must be made dynamic, and
   will need to increase and decrease as group sizes vary.

   The procedure for increasing the sampling probability is easy. A
   participant starts with a mask with m=0. Under these conditions,
   every received SSRC will be stored in the table, so there is
   effectively no sampling. At some point, the value of m is increased.
   This implies that approximately half of the SSRC already in the table
   will no longer match the key under the masking operation. In order to
   maintain a correct estimate, these SSRC must be discarded from the
   table. New SSRC are only added if they match the key under the new
   mask.

   The decision about when to increase the number of bits in the mask is
   also simple. Lets say an RTP participant has a memory with enough
   capacity to store C entries in the table. The best estimate of the
   group is obtained by the largest sampling probability. This also
   means that the best estimate is obtained the fuller the table is. A
   reasonable approach is therefore to increase the number of bits in



J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne                                  [Page 4]


Internet Draft                RTP Sampling                 July 20, 1999


   the mask just as the table fills to C. This will generally cause its
   contents to be reduced by half. Once the table fills again, the
   number of bits in the mask is further increased.

4 Reducing the Sampling Probability

   If the group size begins to decrease, it may be necessary to reduce
   the number of bits in the mask. Not doing so will result in extremely
   poor estimates of the group size. Unfortunately, reducing the number
   of bits in the mask is more difficult than increasing them.

   When the number of bits in the mask increases, the user compensates
   by removing those SSRC which no longer match. When the number of bits
   decreases, the user should theoretically add back those users whose
   SSRC now match. However, these SSRC are not known, since the whole
   point of sampling was to not have to remember them. Therefore, if the
   number of bits in the mask is just reduced without any changes in the
   membership table, the group estimate will instantly drop by exactly
   half.

   To compensate for this, some kind of algorithm is needed. Two
   approaches are presented here: a corrective-factor solution, and a
   binning solution.

4.1 Corrective Factors

   The idea with the corrective factors is to add in or multiply the
   group size estimate by some corrective factor to compensate for the
   change in sample mask. The corrective factors should decay as the
   "fudged" members are eventually learned about and actually placed in
   the membership list.

   The multiplicative corrective factor starts at 2, and gradually
   decays to one. The additive factor starts at the difference between
   the group size estimate before and after the number of bits in the
   mask is reduced, and decays to 0 (this is not always half the group
   size estimate, as the corrective factors can be compounded, see
   below). Both factors decay over a time of cL(ts-), where c is the
   average RTCP packet size divided by the RTCP bandwidth for receivers,
   and L(ts-) is the group size estimate just before the change in the
   number of bits in the mask at time ts. The reason for this constant
   is as follows. In the case where the actual group membership has not
   changed, those members which were forgotten will still be sending
   RTCP packets. The amount of time it will take to hear an RTCP packet
   from each of them is the average RTCP interval, which is cL(ts-).
   Therefore, by cL(ts-) seconds after the change in the mask, those
   users who were fudged by the corrective factor should have sent a
   packet and thus appear in the table. We chose to decay both functions



J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne                                  [Page 5]


Internet Draft                RTP Sampling                 July 20, 1999


   linearly. This is because the rate of arrival of RTCP packets is
   linear.

   What happens if the number of bits in the mask is reduced once again
   before the previous corrective factor has expired? In that case, we
   compound the factors by using yet another one. Let fi() represent the
   ith correction function. If ts is the time when the number of bits in
   the mask is reduced, we can describe the additive correction factor
   as:



             / 0                                  ,   t < ts
             |                   ts + cL(ts-) - t
   fi(t)  =  |( L(ts-) - L(ts+)) ---------------- ,   ts < t < ts+cL(ts-)
             |                        cL(ts-)
             | 0                                  ,   t > ts + cL(ts-)
             \



   and the multiplicative factor as:


             /  1                      , t < ts
             |
             |  ts + 2cL(ts-) - t
   fi(t)  =  |  -----------------      , ts < t < ts + cL(ts-)
             |       cL(ts-)
             |
              \ 1                      , t > ts + cL(ts-)



   Note that in these equations, L(t) denotes the group size estimate
   obtained including the corrective factors except for the new factor.
   ts- is the time right before the reduction in the number of bits, and
   ts+ the time after. As a result, L(ts-) represents the group size
   estimate before the reduction, and L(ts+) the estimate right after,
   but not including the new factor.

   Finally, the actual group size estimate L(t) is given by:


          -----
          \
   L(t) = /      fi(t) + N*(2**m)
          -----
            i

Internet Draft                RTP Sampling                 July 20, 1999





   for the additive factor, and:


          ------
           |  |
           |  |
   L(t)=   |  |  N*(2**m)*fi(t)



   for the multiplicative factor.

   Simulations showed that both algorithms performed equally well, but
   both tended to seriously underestimate the group size when the group
   membership was rapidly declining. This is demonstrated in the
   performance data below.

4.2 Binning Algorithm

   In order to more correctly estimate the group size even when it was
   rapidly decreasing, a binning algorithm can be used. The algorithm
   works as follows. There are 32 bins, same as the number of bits in
   the sample mask. When an RTCP packet from a new user arrives whose
   SSRC matches the key under the masking operation, it is placed in the
   mth bin (where m is the number of ones in the mask) otherwise it is
   discarded.

   When the number of bits in the mask is to be increased, those members
   in the bin who still match after the new mask are moved into the next
   higher bin. Those who don't match are discarded. When the number of
   bits in the mask is to be decreased, nothing is done. Users in the
   various bins stay where they are. However, when an RTCP packet for a
   user shows up, and the user is in a bin with a higher value than the
   current number of bits in the mask, it is moved into the bin
   corresponding to the current number of bits in the mask. Finally, the
   group size estimate L(t) is obtained by:


           31
          ----
          \
   L(t) = /    B(i) * 2**i
          ----
           i=0



J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne                                  [Page 7]


Internet Draft                RTP Sampling                 July 20, 1999


   Where B(i) are the number of users in the ith bin.

   The algorithm works by basically keeping the old estimate when the
   number of bits in the mask drops. As users arrive, they are gradually
   moved into the lower bin, reducing the amount that the higher bin
   contributes to the total estimate. However, the old estimate is still
   updated in the sense that users which timeout are removed from the
   higher bin, and users who send BYE packets are also removed from the
   higher bin. This allows the older estimate to still adapt, while
   gradually phasing it out. It is this adaptation which makes it
   perform much better than the corrective algorithms. The algorithm is
   also extremely simple.

4.3 Comparison

   The algorithms are all compared via simulation in Table 1. In the
   simulation, 10,001 users join a group at t=0. At t=10,000, 5000 of
   them leave. At t=20,000, another 5000 leave. All implement an SSRC
   sampling algorithm, unconditional forward reconsideration and BYE
   reconsideration. The table depicts the group size estimate from time
   20,000 to time 25,000 as seen by the single user present throughout
   the entire session. In the simulation, a memory size of 1000 SSRC was
   assumed. The performance without sampling, and with sampling with the
   additive, multiplicative, and bin-based correction are depicted.

   As the table shows, the bin based algorithm performs particularly
   well at capturing the group size estimate towards the tail end of the
   simulation.

4.4 Sender Sampling

   Care must be taken in handling senders when using SSRC sampling.
   Since the number of senders is generally small, and they contribute
   significantly to the computation of the RTCP interval, sampling
   should not be applied to them. However, they must be kept in a
   separate table, and not be "counted" as part of the general group
   membership. If this is done, the group size estimate will be inflated
   to overemphasize the senders.

   This is easily demonstrated analytically. Let Ns be the number of
   senders, and Nr be the number of receivers. The membership table will
   contain all Ns senders and (1/2)**m of the receivers. The total group
   size estimate in the current draft is obtained by 2**m times the
   number of entries in the table. Therefore, the group size estimate
   becomes:


   L(t) = (2**m) Ns + Nr



   which exponentially weights the senders.

   This is easily compensated for in the binning algorithm. A sender is
   always placed in the 0th bin. When a sender becomes a receiver, it is
   moved into the bin corresponding to the current value of m, if its
   SSRC matches the key under the masked comparison operation.

5 Security Considerations

   The mechanisms described here introduce no additional security
   considerations beyond those described in [1].
