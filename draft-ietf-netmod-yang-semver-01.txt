1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] puts forth a number of
   concepts relating to modified rules for updating modules, a means to
   signal when a new revision of a module has non-backwards-compatible
   (NBC) changes compared to its previous revision, and a versioning
   scheme that uses the revision history as a lineage for determining
   from where a specific revision of a YANG module is derived.
   Additionally, section 3.3 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning]
   defines a revision label which can be used as an overlay or alias to
   provide additional context or an additional way to refer to a
   specific revision.

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


   This document defines a revision-label scheme that uses modified
   [semver] rules for YANG artifacts (i.e., YANG modules and YANG
   packages [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages]) as well as the revision
   label definition for using this scheme.  The goal of this is to add a
   human readable version label that provides compatibility information
   for the YANG artifact without one needing to compare or parse its
   body.  The label and rules defined herein represent the RECOMMENDED
   revision label scheme for IETF YANG artifacts.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology:

   o  YANG artifact: YANG modules, YANG packages
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages], and YANG schema elements are
      examples of YANG artifacts for the purposes of this document.

3.  YANG Semantic Versioning

   This section defines YANG Semantic Versioning, explains how it is
   used with YANG artifacts, and the rules associated with changing an
   artifact's semantic version number when its contents are updated.

3.1.  YANG Semantic Versioning Pattern

   YANG artifacts that employ semantic versioning as defined in this
   document MUST use a version string (e.g., in revision-label or as a
   package version) that corresponds to the following pattern:
   X.Y.Z_COMPAT.  Where:

   o  X, Y and Z are mandatory non-negative integers that are each less
      than 2147483647 (i.e., the maximum signed 32-bit integer value)
      and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes

   o  The '.' is a literal period (ASCII character 0x2e)

   o  The '_' is an optional single literal underscore (ASCII character
      0x5f) and MUST only present if the following COMPAT element is
      included

   o  COMPAT, if it is specified, MUST be either the literal string
      "compatible" or the literal string "non_compatible"

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


   Additionally, [semver] defines two specific types of metadata that
   may be appended to a semantic version string.  Pre-release metadata
   MAY be appended to a semver string after a trailing '-' character.
   Build metadata MAY be appended after a trailing '+' character.  If
   both pre-release and build metadata are present, then build metadata
   MUST follow pre-release metadata.  While build metadata MUST be
   ignored by YANG semver parsers, pre-release metadata MUST be used
   during module development and MUST be considered base on Section 5.
   Both pre-release and build metadata are allowed in order to support
   all of the [semver] rules.  Thus, a version lineage that follows
   strict [semver] rules is allowed for a YANG artifact.

   To signal the use of this versioning scheme, modules MUST set the
   revision-label-scheme extension as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] to the identity "yang-
   semver".  That identity value is defined in the ietf-yang-semver
   module below.

   Additionally, this ietf-yang-semver module defines a typedef that
   formally specifies the syntax of the YANG semver version string.

3.2.  Semantic Versioning Scheme for YANG Artifacts

   This document defines the YANG semantic versioning scheme that is
   used for YANG artifacts that employ the YANG semver label.  The
   versioning scheme has the following properties:

      The YANG semantic versioning scheme is extended from version 2.0.0
      of the semantic versioning scheme defined at semver.org [semver]
      to cover the additional requirements for the management of YANG
      artifact lifecyles that cannot be addressed using the semver.org
      2.0.0 versioning scheme alone.

      Unlike the [semver] versioning scheme, the YANG semantic
      versioning scheme supports limited updates to older versions of
      YANG artifacts, to allow for bug fixes and enhancements to
      artifact versions that are not the latest.  However, it does not
      provide for the unlimited branching and updating of older
      revisions which are documented by the general rules in
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].

      YANG artifacts that follow the [semver] versioning scheme are
      fully compatible with implementations that understand the YANG
      semantic versioning scheme defined in this document.

      If updates are always restricted to the latest revision of the
      artifact only, then the version numbers used by the YANG semantic

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


      versioning scheme are exactly the same as those defined by the
      [semver] versioning scheme.

   Every YANG module versioned using the YANG semantic versioning scheme
   specifies the module's semantic version number as the argument to the
   'rev:revision-label' statement.

   Because the rules put forth in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] are designed to work well
   with existing versions of YANG and allow for artifact authors to
   migrate to this scheme, it is not expected that all revisions of a
   given YANG artifact will have a semantic version label.  For example,
   the first revision of a module may have been produced before this
   scheme was available.

   YANG packages that make use of this semantic versioning scheme will
   have their semantic version as the value of the "revision_label"
   property.

   As stated above, the YANG semver version number is expressed as a
   string of the form: 'X.Y.Z_COMPAT'; where X, Y, and Z each represent
   non-negative integers smaller than 2147483647 without leading zeroes,
   and _COMPAT represents an optional suffix of either "_compatible" or
   "_non_compatible".

   o  'X' is the MAJOR version.  Changes in the major version number
      indicate changes that are non-backwards-compatible to versions
      with a lower major version number.

   o  'Y' is the MINOR version.  Changes in the minor version number
      indicate changes that are backwards-compatible to versions with
      the same major version number, but a lower minor version number
      and no patch "_compatible" or "_non_compatible" modifier.

   o  'Z_COMPAT' is the PATCH version and modifier.  Changes in the
      patch version number can indicate editorial, backwards-compatible,
      or non-backwards-compatible changes relative to versions with the
      same major and minor version numbers, but lower patch version
      number, depending on what form modifier "_COMPAT" takes:

      *  If the modifier string is absent, the change represents an
         editorial change.  An editorial change is defined to be a
         change in the YANG artifact's content that does not affect the
         semantic meaning or functionality provided by the artifact in
         any way.  An example is correcting a spelling mistake in the
         description of a leaf within a YANG module.  Note:
         restructuring how a module uses, or does not use, submodules is
         treated as an editorial level change on the condition that

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


         there is no change in the module's semantic behavior due to the
         restructuring.

      *  If, however, the modifier string is present, the meaning is
         described below:

      *  "_compatible" - the change represents a backwards-compatible
         change

      *  "_non_compatible" - the change represents a non-backwards-
         compatible change

   The YANG artifact name and YANG semantic version number uniquely
   identify a revision of said artifact.  There MUST NOT be multiple
   instances of a YANG artifact definition with the same name and YANG
   semantic version number but different content (and in the case of
   modules, different revision dates).

   There MUST NOT be multiple versions of a YANG artifact that have the
   same MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH version numbers, but different patch
   modifier strings.  E.g., artifact version "1.2.3_non_compatible" MUST
   NOT be defined if artifact version "1.2.3" has already been defined.

3.2.1.  Examples for YANG semantic version numbers

   The following diagram and explanation illustrates how YANG semantic
   version numbers work.

   Example YANG semantic version numbers for an example artifact:

           0.1.0
             |
           0.2.0
             |
           1.0.0
             |  \
             |   1.1.0 -> 1.1.1_compatible -> 1.1.2_non_compatible
             |    |
             |   1.2.0 -> 1.2.1_non_compatible -> 1.2.2_non_compatible
             |    |
             |   1.3.0 -> 1.3.1
             |
           2.0.0
             |
           3.0.0
                \
                 3.1.0

   Assume the tree diagram above illustrates how an example YANG
   module's version history might evolve.  For example, the tree might
   represent the following changes, listed in chronological order from
   oldest revision to newest:

      0.1.0 - first beta module version

      0.2.0 - second beta module version (with NBC changes)

      1.0.0 - first release (may have NBC changes from 0.2.0)

      1.1.0 - added new functionality, leaf "foo" (BC)

      1.2.0 - added new functionality, leaf "baz" (BC)

      1.3.0 - improve existing functionality, added leaf "foo-64" (BC)

      1.3.1 - improve description wording for "foo-64" (Editorial)

      1.1.1_compatible - backport "foo-64" leaf to 1.1.x to avoid
      implementing "baz" from 1.2.0 (BC)

      2.0.0 - change existing model for performance reasons, e.g. re-key
      list (NBC)

      1.1.2_non_compatible - NBC point bug fix, not required in 2.0.0
      due to model changes (NBC)

      3.0.0 - NBC bugfix, rename "baz" to "bar"; also add new BC leaf
      "wibble"; (NBC)

      1.2.1_non_compatible - backport NBC fix, changing "baz" to "bar"

      1.2.2_non_compatible - backport "wibble".  This is a BC change but
      "non_compatible" modifier is sticky.

      3.1.0 - introduce new leaf "wobble" (BC)

   The partial ordering relationships based on the semantic versioning
   numbers can be defined as follows:

      1.0.0 < 1.1.0 < 1.2.0 < 1.3.0 < 2.0.0 < 3.0.0 < 3.1.0

      1.0.0 < 1.1.0 < 1.1.1_compatible < 1.1.2_non_compatible

      1.0.0 < 1.1.0 < 1.2.0 < 1.2.1_non_compatible <
      1.2.2_non_compatible

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


   There is no ordering relationship between 1.1.1_non_compatible and
   either 1.2.0 or 1.2.1_non_compatible, except that they share the
   common ancestor of 1.1.0.

   Looking at the version number alone, the module definition in 2.0.0
   does not necessarily contain the contents of 1.3.0.  However, the
   module revision history in 2.0.0 may well indicate that it was edited
   from module version 1.3.0.

3.3.  YANG Semantic Version Update Rules

   When a new revision of an artifact is produced, then the following
   rules define how the YANG semantic version number for the new
   artifact revision is calculated, based on the changes between the two
   artifact revisions, and the YANG semantic version number of the base
   artifact revision from which the changes are derived:

   1.  If an artifact is being updated in a non-backwards-compatible
       way, then the artifact version
       "X.Y.Z[_compatible|_non_compatible]" MUST be updated to "X+1.0.0"
       unless that artifact version has already been defined with
       different content, in which case the artifact version
       "X.Y.Z+1_non_compatible" MUST be used instead.

   2.  Under some circumstances (e.g., to avoid adding a "_compatible"
       modifier) an artifact author MAY also update the MAJOR version
       when the only changes are backwards-compatible.  This is where
       tooling is important to highlight all changes.  Because, while
       avoiding the "_compatible" and "_non_compatible" modifiers have a
       clear advantage, bumping a MAJOR version when changes are
       entirely backwards-compatible may confuse end users.

   3.  If an artifact is being updated in a backwards-compatible way,
       then the next version number depends on the format of the current
       version number:

       i     "X.Y.Z" - the artifact version MUST be updated to
             "X.Y+1.0", unless that artifact version has already been
             defined with different content, when the artifact version
             MUST be updated to "X.Y.Z+1_compatible"" instead.

       ii    "X.Y.Z_compatible" - the artifact version MUST be updated
             to "X.Y.Z+1_compatible".

       iii   "X.Y.Z_non_compatible" - the artifact version MUST be
             updated to "X.Y.Z+1_non_compatible".

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


   4.  If an artifact is being updated in an editorial way, then the
       next version number depends on the format of the current version
       number:

       i     "X.Y.Z" - the artifact version MUST be updated to "X.Y.Z+1"

       ii    "X.Y.Z_compatible" - the artifact version MUST be updated
             to "X.Y.Z+1_compatible".

       iii   "X.Y.Z_non_compatible" - the artifact version MUST be
             updated to "X.Y.Z+1_non_compatible".

   5.  YANG artifact semantic version numbers beginning with 0, i.e
       "0.X.Y" are regarded as beta definitions and need not follow the
       rules above.  Either the MINOR or PATCH version numbers may be
       updated, regardless of whether the changes are non-backwards-
       compatible, backwards-compatible, or editorial.  See Section 5
       for more details on using this notation during module
       development.

3.4.2.  Example of Package Using YANG Semver

   Below is an example YANG package that uses the semver revision label
   based on the rules defined in this document.

      {
        "ietf-yang-instance-data:instance-data-set": {
          "name": "example-yang-pkg",
          "target-ptr": "TBD",
          "timestamp": "2018-09-06T17:00:00Z",
          "description": "Example IETF package definition",
          "content-data": {
            "ietf-yang-package:yang-package": {
              "name": "example-yang-pkg",
              "version": "1.3.1",
              ...
     }

4.  Import Module by Semantic Version

   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] allows for imports to be
   done based on a module or a derived revision of a module.  The
   rev:revision-or-derived statement can specify either a revision date
   or a revision label.  When importing by semver, the YANG semver
   revision label value MAY be used as an argument to rev:revision-or-
   derived.  In so, any module which has that semver label as its latest
   revision label or has that label in its revision history can be used
   to satisfy the import requirement.  For example:

           import example-module {
             rev:revision-or-derived "3.0.0";
           }

   Note: the import lookup does not stop when a non-backward-compatible
   change is encountered.  That is, if module B imports a module A at or
   derived from version 2.0.0, resolving that import will pass through a
   revision of module A with version 2.1.0_non_compatible in order to
   determine if the present instance of module A derives from 2.0.0.

5.  Guidelines for Using Semver During Module Development

   This section and the IETF-specific sub-section below provides YANG
   semver-specific guidelines to consider when developing new YANG
   modules.  As such this section updates [RFC8407].

   Development of a brand new YANG module outside of the IETF that uses
   YANG semver as its revision-label scheme SHOULD begin with a 0 for
   the MAJOR version component.  This allows the module to disregard



Claise, et al.          Expires January 14, 2021               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


   strict semver rules with respect to non-backwards-compatible changes
   during its initial development.  However, module developers MAY
   choose to use the semver pre-release syntax instead with a 1 for the
   MAJOR version component.  For example, an initial module revision-
   label might be either 0.0.1 or 1.0.0-alpha.1.  If the authors choose
   to use the 0 MAJOR version component scheme, they MAY switch to the
   pre-release scheme with a MAJOR version component of 1 when the
   module is nearing initial release (e.g., a module's revision label
   may transition from 0.3.0 to 1.0.0-beta.1 to indicate it is more
   mature and ready for testing).

   When using pre-release notation, the format MUST include at least one
   alphabetic component and MUST end with a '.' and then one or more
   digits.  These alphanumeric components will be used when deciding
   pre-release precedence.  The following are examples of valid pre-
   release versions

      1.0.0-alpha.1

      1.0.0-alpha.3

      2.1.0-beta.42

      3.0.0-202007.rc.1

   When developing a new revision of an existing module using the YANG
   semver revision-label scheme, the intended target semver version MUST
   be used along with pre-release notation.  For example, if a released
   module which has a current revision-label of 1.0.0 is being modified
   with the intent to make non-backwards-compatible changes, the first
   development MAJOR version component must be 2 with some pre-release
   notation such as -alpha.1, making the version 2.0.0-alpha.1.  That
   said, every publicly available release of a module MUST have a unique
   YANG semver revision-label (where a publicly available release is one
   that could be implemented by a vendor or consumed by an end user).
   Therefore, it may be prudent to include the year or year and month
   development began (e.g., 2.0.0-201907-alpha.1).  As a module
   undergoes development, it is possible that the original intent
   changes.  For example, a 1.0.0 version of a module that was destined
   to become 2.0.0 after a development cycle may have had a scope change
   such that the final version has no non-backwards-compatible changes
   and becomes 1.1.0 instead.  This change is acceptable to make during
   the development phase so long as pre-release notation is present in
   both versions (e.g., 2.0.0-alpha.3 becomes 1.1.0-alpha.4).  However,
   on the next development cycle (after 1.1.0 is released), if again the
   new target release is 2.0.0, new pre-release components must be used
   such that every revision-label for a given module MUST be unique
   throughout its entire lifecycle (e.g., the first pre-release version



Claise, et al.          Expires January 14, 2021               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


   might be 2.0.0-202005-alpha.1 if keeping the same year and month
   notation mentioned above).

5.1.  Pre-release Version Precedence

   [TODO: Describe precedence considering there could be changes during
   development and parallel development tracks.]

5.2.  YANG Semver in IETF Modules

   Net new module development within the IETF SHOULD begin with the 0
   MAJOR number scheme as described above.  When revising an existing
   IETF module, the revision-label MUST use the target (i.e., intended)
   MAJOR and MINOR version components with a 0 patch version component.
   If the intended ratified release will be non-backward-compatible with
   the current ratified release, the MINOR version component MUST be 0.

   All IETF modules in development MUST use the whole document name as a
   pre-release version string, including the current document revision.
   For example, if a module which is currently released at version 1.0.0
   is being revised to include non-backwards-compatible changes in
   draft-user-netmod-foo, its development revision-labels MUST include
   2.0.0-draft-user-netmod-foo followed by the document's revision
   (e.g., 2.0.0-draft-user-netmod-foo-02).  This will ensure each pre-
   release version is unique across the lifecycle of the module.  Even
   when using the 0 MAJOR version for initial module development (where
   MINOR and PATCH can change), appending the draft name as a pre-
   release component helps to ensure uniqueness when there are perhaps
   multiple, parallel efforts creating the same module.

   If a module is being revised and the original module never had a
   revision-label (i.e., you wish to start using YANG semver in future
   module revisions), choose a semver value that makes the most sense
   based on the module's history.  For example, if a module started out
   in the pre-NMDA ([RFC8342]) world, and then had NMDA support added
   without removing any legacy "state" branches -- and you are looking
   to add additional new features -- a sensible choice for the target
   YANG semver would be 1.2.0 (since 1.0.0 would have been the initial,
   pre-NMDA release, and 1.1.0 would have been the NMDA revision).

   See Appendix A for a detailed example of IETF pre-release versions.

Appendix A.  Example IETF Module Development

   Assume a new YANG module is being developed in the netmod working
   group in the IETF.  Initially, this module is being developed in an
   individual internet draft, draft-jdoe-netmod-example-module.  The
   following represents the initial version tree (i.e., value of
   revision-label) of the module as it's being initially developed.

Internet-Draft                 YANG Semver                     July 2020


   Version lineage for initial module development:

         0.0.1-draft-jdoe-netmod-example-module-00
           |
         0.1.0-draft-jdoe-netmod-example-module-01
           |
         0.2.0-draft-jdoe-netmod-example-module-02
           |
         0.2.1-draft-jdoe-netmod-example-module-03

   At this point, development stabilizes, and the workgroup adopts the
   draft.  Thus now the draft becomes draft-ietf-netmod-example-module.
   The initial pre-release lineage continues as follows.

   Continued version lineage after adoption:

       1.0.0-draft-ietf-netmod-example-module-00
         |
       1.0.0-draft-ietf-netmod-example-module-01
         |
       1.0.0-draft-ietf-netmod-example-module-02

   At this point, the draft is ratified and becomes RFC12345 and the
   YANG module version number becomes 1.0.0.

   A time later, the module needs to be revised to add additional
   capabilities.  Development will be done in a backwards-compatible
   way.  Two new individual drafts are proposed to go about adding the
   capabilities in different ways: draft-jdoe-netmod-exmod-enhancements
   and draft-jadoe-netmod-exmod-changes.  These are initially developed
   in parallel with the following versions.

   Parallel development for next module revision:

      1.1.0-draft-jdoe-netmod-exmod-enhancements-00 || 1.1.0-draft-jadoe-netmod-exmod-changes-00
        |                                                |
      1.1.0-draft-jdoe-netmod-exmod-enhancements-01 || 1.1.0-draft-jadoe-netmod-exmod-changes-01

   At this point, the WG decides to merge some aspects of both and adopt
   the work in jadoe's draft as draft-ietf-netmod-exmod-changes.  A
   single version lineage continues.
