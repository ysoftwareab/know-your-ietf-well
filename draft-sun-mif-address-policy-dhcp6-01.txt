Internet-Draft   Address Policy Configured by DHCPv6        March 2009 
    

   For hosts with multiple interfaces, the problem is how to make it run 
   several applications simultaneously on variant interfaces such as 
   GPRS, Wifi etc. To achieve this, one way is to select appropriate IP 
   address so that the packets can be sent to the corresponding 
   interface for forwarding. RFC 3484 defines a ''policy table'' for 
   default IP address selection. This document extends the DHCPv6 option 
   message so that the policy table can be dynamically updated.

1. Introduction 

   A host such as a laptop or a smart-phone may have multiple interfaces 
   for connections, e.g., a wired Ethernet LAN, a 802.11 LAN, a 3G cell 
   network, one or multiple VPNs or tunnels. In view of more and more 
   versatile applications, users may expect a host to utilize several 
   interfaces at the same time.   

   If the source IP address is selected and bind by an application, then 
   the application can use certain interface in this way. However, 
   source IP addresses are generally added by sockets in IP layer. 
   According to [RFC 1122], all the packets whose destination IP 
   addresses is not specified in the route table will be send to a 
   default gateway for forwarding. Accordingly, the IP address 
   corresponding to the default gateway is chosen as the source IP 
   address. 

   To avoid all packets passing through the same interface corresponding 
   to the default gateway, the approach in this document configures the 
   IP address ''policy table'' defined in [RFC 3484]

Internet-Draft   Address Policy Configured by DHCPv6        March 2009 
    

   To address multi-homed problems in a flexible way, [I-D-hui-mif-
   dhcpv4-routing-00] extends DHCPv4 through introducing TOS and 
   specific routes into DHCP options. This document considers IPv6 
   situations. The approach presented in [I-D. sun-mif-route-config-
   dhcp6-00] is an approach which extends DHCP option for sending route 
   information. The route table and the address selection policy table 
   can be used jointly to let multiple interfaces work simultaneously.  

2. Solution of Multiple Interface Usage 

   The procedures of configuring policy table of address selection are 
   depicted in Figure 1. 

   The policy table configure procedures are shown as steps a1 to a3. 

   o a1) An interface sends Information-requirement when the connection 
      is established or when an existing connection receives 
      reconfiguration message from the server. 

   o a2) The server sends policy rults through DHCPv6 option as to be 
      defined in Section 3.2. 

   o a3) The policy rules received from the interface is used to 
      configure the policy table of the host. 

   The procedures that an application employs an interface for network 
   access are depicted in Figure 1 as steps b1 to b4. 

   o b1) An application calls sockets to build IP packets. 

   o b2) The socket determines the destination and selects source 
      address based on the policy table. 

   o b3) The socket sends packets to the corresponding interface. 

   o b4) The interface will forward the packets to the next hop (the 
      corresponding gateway).

                       interface for an application. 

   Notice that the approach proposed in this document is feasible under 
   the strong ES model as defined in RFC1122.  

3. DHCPv6 Option Extensions 

3.1. Host and Server Behavior 

   The host must include ''Option Request'' option to let the server know 
   the option the host interested. The request option code is set as the 
   ''Address Policy'' defined in 3.2. 

   The server constructs a Reply message to provide IP address policy 
   rules to the host.  Also, a server may send a Reconfigure Message to 
   a host. The host may initiate a request when receiving the 
   Reconfigure message for the host. 

3.2. Address Policy Option 

   The DHCPv6 option is extended to contain multiple pieces of default 
   address selection policy rules. Each piece of rules contains address, 
   preference and label which are properties defined in [RFC3484]. The 
   ADDRESS_POLICY option is depicted in Figure 2.

   interfaces.

3.3. Some Considerations of the DHCPv6 Option 

3.3.1. Conflict of A Policy Table 

   For the situations where the rule in the policy table conflicts with 
   one previous policy table, the latter one will override the previous 
   rule. 

3.3.2. Application Situations 

   There are two situations when DHCPv6 is applied, i.e., with or 
   without stateless autoconfiguration.  For the stateless case, since 
   the address has been configured based on the link-local/site-local 
   address, the DHCPv6 is used to obtain options. 

3.3.3. Not Limited to DHCP Servers 

   The solution presented in this document is with the context of DHCP 
   message. It should be pointed out that similar message may not be 
   conveyed by certain node in the network instead of a DHCP server. 
   Router solicitation and advertisement are also potential approach to 
   convey the  

4. IANA Considerations 

   The option code of ADDRESS_POLICY will be defined by IANA. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security issues in this document are similar with those that have 
   been met when using DHCPv6 options. 

   The interface selection is affected by the routing and address 
   selection rules sent from servers. Therefore, incorrect information 
   received by hosts will cause improper interface selection leading to 
   bad user experiences. Attacks such as deny of services (DoS) or man-
   in-the-middle may redirect host's solicitation, change the 
   information or flood the host with invalidate messages. Approaches to 
   guarantee the communication securities between hosts and servers 
   should be applied based on the network access types of the interfaces.
