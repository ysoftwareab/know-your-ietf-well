1.  Introduction

   This document defines the use of the ARIA [RFC5794] block cipher
   algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]
   for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
   [RFC3550] traffic.

1.1.  ARIA

   ARIA is a general-purpose block cipher algorithm developed by Korean
   cryptographers in 2003.  It is an iterated block cipher with 128-,
   192-, and 256-bit keys and encrypts 128-bit blocks in 12, 14, and 16

   rounds, depending on the key size.  It is secure and suitable for
   most software and hardware implementations on 32-bit and 8-bit
   processors.  It was established as a Korean standard block cipher
   algorithm in 2004 [ARIAKS] and has been widely used in Korea,
   especially for government-to-public services.  It was included in
   PKCS #11 in 2007 [ARIAPKCS].  The algorithm specification and object
   identifiers are described in [RFC5794].

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Cryptographic Transforms

   Block ciphers ARIA and AES share common characteristics including
   mode, key size, and block size.  ARIA does not have any restrictions
   for modes of operation that are used with this block cipher.  We
   define two modes of running ARIA within the SRTP protocol, (1) ARIA
   in Counter Mode (ARIA-CTR) and (2) ARIA in Galois/Counter Mode (ARIA-
   GCM).

2.1.  ARIA-CTR

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES-128 counter mode encryption,
   which it refers to as "AES_CM".  Section 2 of [RFC6188] defines
   "AES_256_CM" in SRTP.  ARIA counter modes are defined in the same
   manner except that each invocation of AES is replaced by that of ARIA
   [RFC5794], and are denoted by ARIA_128_CTR and ARIA_256_CTR,
   respectively, according to the key lengths.  The plaintext inputs to
   the block cipher are formed as in AES-CTR(AES_CM, AES_256_CM) and the
   block cipher outputs are processed as in AES-CTR.  Note that, ARIA-
   CTR MUST be used only in conjunction with an authentication
   transform.

   Section 3.2 of [RFC6904] defines AES-CTR for SRTP header extension
   keystream generation.  When ARIA-CTR is used, the header extension
   keystream SHALL be generated in the same manner except that each
   invocation of AES is replaced by that of ARIA [RFC5794].

2.2.  ARIA-GCM

   GCM (Galois Counter Mode) [GCM][RFC5116] is an AEAD (Authenticated
   Encryption with Associated Data) block cipher mode.  A detailed
   description of ARIA-GCM is defined similarly as AES-GCM found in
   [RFC5116][RFC5282].

Internet-Draft           ARIA Algorithm for SRTP             August 2017


   The document [RFC7714] describes the use of AES-GCM with SRTP
   [RFC3711][RFC6904].  The use of ARIA-GCM with SRTP is defined the
   same as that of AES-GCM except that each invocation of AES is
   replaced by ARIA [RFC5794].  When encryption of header extensions
   [RFC6904] is in use, a separate keystream to encrypt selected RTP
   header extension elements MUST be generated in the same manner
   defined in [RFC7714] except that AES-CTR is replaced by ARIA-CTR.

3.  Key Derivation Functions

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines the AES-128 counter mode key
   derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF".  Section 3
   of [RFC6188] defines the AES-256 counter mode key derivation
   function, which it refers to as "AES_256_CM_PRF".  The ARIA-CTR PRF
   is defined in a same manner except that each invocation of AES is
   replaced by that of ARIA.  According to the key lengths of underlying
   encryption algorithm, ARIA-CTR PRFs are denoted by "ARIA_128_CTR_PRF"
   and "ARIA_256_CTR_PRF".  The usage requirements of [RFC6188][RFC7714]
   regarding the AES-CM PRF apply to the ARIA-CTR PRF as well.

4.  Protection Profiles

   This section defines SRTP Protection Profiles that use the ARIA
   transforms and key derivation functions defined in this document.
   The following list indicates the SRTP transform parameters for each
   protection profile.  Those are described for use with DTLS-SRTP
   [RFC5764].

   The parameters cipher_key_length, cipher_salt_length,
   auth_key_length, and auth_tag_length express the number of bits in
   the values to which they refer.  The maximum_lifetime parameter
   indicates the maximum number of packets that can be protected with
   each single set of keys when the parameter profile is in use.  All of
   these parameters apply to both RTP and RTCP, unless the RTCP
   parameters are separately specified.

   The ARIA-CTR protection profiles use the same authentication
   transform that is mandatory to implement in SRTP, HMAC-SHA1 with a
   160-bit key.

   Note that SRTP Protection Profiles that use AEAD algorithms do not
   specify an auth_function, auth_key_length, or auth_tag_length, since
   they do not use a separate auth_function, auth_key, or auth_tag.  The
   term aead_auth_tag_length is used to emphasize that this refers to
   the authentication tag provided by the AEAD algorithm and that this
   tag is not located in the authentication tag field provided by SRTP/
   SRTCP.

   The PRFs for ARIA protection profiles are defined by ARIA-CTR PRF of
   the equal key length with the encryption algorithm (see Section 2).
   SRTP_ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC and SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_GCM MUST use the
   ARIA_128_CTR_PRF Key Derivation Function.  And SRTP_ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC
   and SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_GCM MUST use the ARIA_256_CTR_PRF Key
   Derivation Function.

   MIKEY specifies the SRTP protection profile definition separately
   from the key length (which is specified by the Session Encryption key
   length) and the authentication tag length.  The DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764]
   protection profiles are mapped to MIKEY parameter sets as shown
   below.

5.  Security Considerations

   At the time of publication of this document no security problem has
   been found on ARIA.  Previous security analysis results are
   summarized in [ATY].

   The security considerations in [GCM] [RFC3711] [RFC5116] [RFC6188]
   [RFC6904] [RFC7714] apply to this document as well.  This document
   includes crypto suites with authentication tags of length less than
   80 bits.  These suites MAY be used for certain application contexts
   where longer authentication tags may be undesirable, for example,
   those mentioned in [RFC3711] section 7.5.  Otherwise, short
   authentication tags SHOULD NOT be used, since may reduce
   authentication strength.  See [RFC3711] section 9.5 for a discussion
   of risks related to weak authentication in SRTP.

   At the time of publication of this document, SRTP recommends HMAC-
   SHA1 as the default and mandatory-to-implement MAC algorithm.  All
   currently registered SRTP crypto suites except the GCM based ones use
   HMAC-SHA1 as their HMAC algorithm to provide message authentication.
   Due to security concerns with SHA-1 [RFC6194], the IETF is gradually
   moving away from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash algorithms such as
   SHA-2 or SHA-3 families.  For SRTP, however, SHA-1 is only used in
   the calculation of an HMAC, and no security issue is known for this
   usage at the time of this publication.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  DTLS-SRTP

   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] defines a DTLS-SRTP "SRTP Protection Profile".
   In order to allow the use of the algorithms defined in this document
   in DTLS-SRTP, IANA is requested to add the protection profiles below
   to the "DTLS-SRTP Protection Profiles" created by [RFC5764], located
   on the following IANA page at time of writing:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/srtp-protection/.

      SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_GCM = {TBD,TBD}
      SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_GCM = {TBD,TBD}

6.2.  MIKEY

   [RFC3830] and [RFC5748] define encryption algorithms and PRFs for the

A.3.  Key Derivation Test Vector

   This section provides test vectors for the default key derivation
   function that uses ARIA in Counter Mode.  In the following, we walk
   through the initial key derivation for the ARIA Counter Mode cipher
   that requires a 16/24/32 octet session encryption key according to
   the session encryption key length and a 14 octet session salt, and an
   authentication function that requires a 94 octet session
   authentication key.  These values are called the cipher key, the
   cipher salt, and the auth key in the following.  The test vectors are
   generated in the same way with the test vectors of key derivation
   functions in [RFC3711] and [RFC6188] but with each invocation of AES
   replaced with an invocation of ARIA.

A.3.1.  ARIA_128_CTR_PRF

   The inputs to the key derivation function are the 16 octet master key
   and the 14 octet master salt:
