                      draft-ietf-cbor-tags-oid-06

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   The present document defines CBOR tags for object identifiers (OIDs).
   It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of
   the CBOR tags so defined.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, [RFC8949]) provides
   for the interchange of structured data without a requirement for a
   pre-agreed schema.  [RFC8949] defines a basic set of data types, as
   well as a tagging mechanism that enables extending the set of data
   types supported via an IANA registry.

   The present document defines CBOR tags for object identifiers (OIDs,
   [X.660]), which many IETF protocols carry.  The ASN.1 Basic Encoding
   Rules (BER, [X.690]) specify binary encodings of both (absolute)
   object identifiers and relative object identifiers.  The contents of
   these encodings (the "value" part of BER's type-length-value
   structure) can be carried in a CBOR byte string.  This document
   defines two CBOR tags that cover the two kinds of ASN.1 object
   identifiers encoded in this way.  The tags can also be applied to
   arrays and maps to efficiently tag all elements of an array or all
   keys of a map.  It is intended as the reference document for the IANA
   registration of the tags so defined.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology of [RFC8949] applies; in particular the term "byte"
   is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for "octet".  The
   term "SDNV" is used as defined in [RFC6256].

2.  Object Identifiers

   The International Object Identifier tree [X.660] is a hierarchically
   managed space of identifiers, each of which is uniquely represented
   as a sequence of unsigned integer values [X.680].  (These integer
   values are called "primary integer values" in X.660 because they can
   be accompanied by (not necessarily unambiguous) secondary
   identifiers.  We ignore the latter and simply use the term "integer
   values" here, occasionally calling out their unsignedness.  We also
   use the term "arc" when the focus is on the edge of the tree labeled
   by such an integer value, as well as in the sense of a "long arc",
   i.e. a (sub)sequence of such integer values.)

   While these sequences can easily be represented in CBOR arrays of
   unsigned integers, a more compact representation can often be
   achieved by adopting the widely used representation of object
   identifiers defined in BER; this representation may also be more
   amenable to processing by other software that makes use of object
   identifiers.

   BER represents the sequence of unsigned integers by concatenating
   self-delimiting [RFC6256] representations of each of the integer
   values in sequence.

   ASN.1 distinguishes absolute object identifiers (ASN.1 Type "OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER"), which begin at a root arc ([X.660] Clause 3.5.21), from
   relative object identifiers (ASN.1 Type "RELATIVE-OID"), which begin
   relative to some object identifier known from context ([X.680] Clause
   3.8.63).  As a special optimization, BER combines the first two
   integers in an absolute object identifier into one numeric identifier
   by making use of the property of the hierarchy that the first arc has
   only three integer values (0, 1, and 2), and the second arcs under 0
   and 1 are limited to the integer values between 0 and 39.  (The root
   arc "joint-iso-itu-t(2)" has no such limitations on its second arc.)
   If X and Y are the first two integer values, the single integer value
   actually encoded is computed as:

      X * 40 + Y

   The inverse transformation (again making use of the known ranges of X
   and Y) is applied when decoding the object identifier.

   Since the semantics of absolute and relative object identifiers
   differ, this specification defines two tags, collectively called the
   "OID tags" here:

   Tag TBD111: tags a byte string as the [X.690] encoding of an absolute
   object identifier (simply "object identifier" or "OID").

   Tag TBD110: tags a byte string as the [X.690] encoding of a relative
   object identifier (also "relative OID").  Since the encoding of each
   number is the same as for [RFC6256] Self-Delimiting Numeric Values
   (SDNVs), this tag can also be used for tagging a byte string that
   contains a sequence of zero or more SDNVs.

   Tag TBD112: structurally like TBD110, but understood to be relative
   to "1.3.6.1.4.1" (IANA Private Enterprise Number OID,
   [IANA.enterprise-numbers]).  Hence, the semantics of the result are
   that of an absolute object identifier.

2.1.  Requirements on the byte string being tagged

   To form a valid tag, a byte string tagged by TBD111, TBD110, or
   TBD112 MUST be syntactically valid contents (the value part) for a
   BER representation of an object identifier (Sections 8.19, 8.20, and
   8.20 of [X.690], respectively): A concatenation of zero or more SDNV
   values, where each SDNV value is a sequence of one or more bytes that
   all have their most significant bit set, except for the last byte,
   where it is unset.  Also, the first byte of each SDNV cannot be a
   leading zero in SDNV's base-128 arithmetic, so it cannot take the
   value 0x80 (bullet (c) in Section 8.1.2.4.2 of [X.690]).

   In other words:

   *  the byte string's first byte, and any byte that follows a byte
      that has the most significant bit unset, MUST NOT be 0x80 (this
      requirement requires expressing the integer values in their
      shortest form, with no leading zeroes)

   *  the byte string's last byte MUST NOT have the most significant bit
      set (this requirement excludes an incomplete final integer value)

   If either of these invalid conditions are encountered, the tag is
   invalid.

Internet-Draft             CBOR Tags for OIDs                 March 2021


   [X.680] restricts RELATIVE-OID values to have at least one arc, i.e.,
   their encoding would have at least one SDNV.  This specification
   permits empty relative object identifiers; they may still be excluded
   by application semantics.

   To facilitate the search for specific object ID values, it is
   RECOMMENDED that definite length encoding (see Section 3.2.3 of
   [RFC8949]) is used for the byte strings used as tag content for these
   tags.

   The valid set of byte strings can also be expressed using regular
   expressions on bytes, using no specific notation but resembling
   [PCRE].  Unlike typical regular expressions that operate on character
   sequences, the following regular expressions take bytes as their
   domain, so they can be applied directly to CBOR byte strings.

   For byte strings with tag TBD111:

      "/^(([\x81-\xFF][\x80-\xFF]*)?[\x00-\x7F])+$/"

   For byte strings with tag TBD110 or TBD112:

      "/^(([\x81-\xFF][\x80-\xFF]*)?[\x00-\x7F])*$/"

   A tag with tagged content that does not conform to the applicable
   regexp is invalid.

2.2.  Discussion

   Staying close to the way object identifiers are encoded in ASN.1 BER
   makes back-and-forth translation easy; otherwise we would choose a
   more efficient encoding.  Object identifiers in IETF protocols are
   serialized in dotted decimal form or BER form, so there is an
   advantage in not inventing a third form.  Also, expectations of the
   cost of encoding object identifiers are based on BER; using a
   different encoding might not be aligned with these expectations.  If
   additional information about an OID is desired, lookup services such
   as the OID Resolution Service (ORS) [X.672] and the OID Repository
   [OID-INFO] are available.

3.  Basic Examples

   This section gives simple examples of an absolute and a relative
   object identifier, represented via tag number TBD111 and TBD110,
   respectively.

   This relative OID saves seven bytes compared to the full OID
   encoding.

4.  Tag Factoring with Arrays and Maps

   OID tags can tag byte strings (as discussed above), but also CBOR
   arrays and maps.  The idea in the latter case is that the tag is
   factored out from each individual item in the container; the tag is
   placed on the array or map instead.

   When an OID tag is applied to an array, it means that the respective
   tag is imputed to all elements of the array that are byte strings,
   arrays, or maps.  (There is no effect on other elements, including
   text strings or tags.)  For example, when an array is tagged with
   TBD111, every array element that is a byte string is an OID, and
   every element that is an array or map is in turn treated as discussed
   here.

   When an OID tag is applied to a map, it means that the respective tag
   is imputed to all keys in the map that are byte strings, arrays, or
   maps; again, there is no effect on keys of other major types.  Note
   that there is also no effect on the values in the map.

   As a result of these rules, tag factoring in nested arrays and maps
   is supported.  For example, a 3-dimensional array of OIDs can be
   composed by using a single TBD111 tag containing an array of arrays
   of arrays of byte strings.  All such byte strings are then considered
   OIDs.

4.1.  Tag Factoring Example: X.500 Distinguished Name

   Consider the X.500 distinguished name:

   Table 1 has four "relative distinguished names" (RDNs).  The country
   and street RDNs are single-valued.  The second and fourth RDNs are
   multi-valued.

   The equivalent representations in CBOR diagnostic notation (Section 8
   of [RFC8949]) and CBOR are:

   111([{ h'550406': "US" },
        { h'550407': "Los Angeles", h'550408': "CA",
          h'550411': "90013" },

   (This example encoding assumes that all attribute values are UTF-8
   strings, or can be represented as UTF-8 strings with no loss of
   information.)

5.  CDDL Control Operators

   CDDL specifications may want to specify the use of SDNVs or SDNV
   sequences (as defined for the tag content for TBD110).  This document
   introduces two new control operators that can be applied to a target
   value that is a byte string:

   *  ".sdnv", with a control type that contains unsigned integers.  The
      byte string is specified to be encoded as an [RFC6256] SDNV (BER
      encoding) for the matching values of the control type.

Internet-Draft             CBOR Tags for OIDs                 March 2021


   *  ".sdnvseq", with a control type that contains arrays of unsigned
      integers.  The byte string is specified to be encoded as a
      sequence of [RFC6256] SDNVs (BER encoding) that decodes to an
      array of unsigned integers matching the control type.

   *  ".oid", like ".sdnvseq", except that the X*40+Y translation for
      absolute OIDs is included (see Figure 8).

   Figure 7 shows an example for the use of ".sdnvseq" for a part of a
   structure using OIDs that could be used in Figure 6; Figure 8 shows
   the same with the ".oid" operator.

   country-rdn = {country-oid => country-value}
   country-oid = bytes .sdnvseq [85, 4, 6]
   country-value = text .size 2

                          Figure 7: Using .sdnvseq

   country-rdn = {country-oid => country-value}
   country-oid = bytes .oid [2, 5, 4, 6]
   country-value = text .size 2

                            Figure 8: Using .oid

   Note that the control type need not be a literal; e.g., "bytes .oid
   [2, 5, 4, *uint]" matches all OIDs inside OID arc 2.5.4,
   "attributeType".

6.  CDDL typenames

   For the use with CDDL [RFC8610], the typenames defined in Figure 9
   are recommended:

   oid = #6.111(bstr)
   roid = #6.110(bstr)
   pen = #6.112(bstr)

   IANA is requested to assign the CBOR tags in Table 2, with the
   present document as the specification reference.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8949] apply.

   The encodings in Clauses 8.19 and 8.20 of [X.690] are quite compact
   and unambiguous, but MUST be followed precisely to avoid security
   pitfalls.  In particular, the requirements set out in Section 2.1 of
   this document need to be followed; otherwise, an attacker may be able
   to subvert a checking process by submitting alternative
   representations that are later taken as the original (or even
   something else entirely) by another decoder supposed to be protected
   by the checking process.

   OIDs and relative OIDs can always be treated as opaque byte strings.
   Actually understanding the structure that was used for generating
   them is not necessary, and, except for checking the structure
   requirements, it is strongly NOT RECOMMENDED to perform any
   processing of this kind (e.g., converting into dotted notation and
   back) unless absolutely necessary.  If the OIDs are translated into
   other representations, the usual security considerations for non-
   trivial representation conversions apply; the integer values are
   unlimited in range.
