Abstract

   It is generally known that the binding acquisition for symmetric NATs
   with STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) protocol will not
   yield a usable address for traversing symmetric NAT. The use of
   symmetric RTP allows you to accompolish symmetric NAT traversal only
   in situations where the other end is open to the Internet, or has a
   full-cone or a restricted-cone NAT.  This document proposes an
   analytical method for symmetric NATs to obtain more detailed
   characteristics of the symmetric NAT using STUN, and describes how we
   can establish a peer-to-peer UDP connection even in situations where
   NATs (including symmetric NATs) are present at both ends.

1 Introduction

   STUN is a useful tool to discover the presence and characteristics of
   Network Address Translators (NATs). (It does not support 'traversal'
   by itself.)  It is generally known that the binding acquisition for
   symmetric NATs, with STUN, will not yield a usable address, and in
   cases that the other end also has a port restricted-cone NAT or
   symmetric NAT, there is no possible way to traverse these NATs.

   We have discovered in our NAT characteristics research, that the
   number of symmetric NATs deployed in the market is significant even
   in the residential market. This is a significant issue, especially
   for service providers or manufacturers who are seriously looking for
   a solution to the actual NAT issues they have.

   TURN (Traversal Using Relay NAT)[2] has been proposed to complement
   the limitation of STUN, however, this type of solution requires a
   relay server somewhere on the public network, which is an additional
   cost for service providers. It is important that service providers
   reduce the amount of server deployments as much as possible.

   This document proposes an analytical method for symmetric NATs to
   obtain more detailed characteristics of symmetric NATs using STUN,
   and describes how we can establish a peer-to-peer UDP connection even
   in situations where the NATs (including symmetric NATs) are present
   at both ends. The operation is based upon a prediction of a set of IP
   address and port that a symmetric NAT will allocate.  However, the
   discovery processes proposed in this document, using STUN, produce a
   fairly good success rate of symmetric NAT traversal. As a result, it
   will significantly reduce the requirement for relay servers.

   This document does not provide any specific protocol, nor a proposal
   for any modifications to current STUN protocol. In order to
   incorporate the method described in this document into existing
   protocols (e.g. SDP), those protocols will need to be modified.  It
   is expected that this method be appropriately examined in this public
   community to yield improvements and as motivation for applying it to
   both old and new protocols.

3 Network Configuration

   The assumption in this document is based upon what is shown in Figure
   3.1, in that there are one or more NATs at both endpoints(EP-a and
   EP-b) that wish to communicate to each other directly through the
   NATs. In order to get information about the NATs, each endpoint uses
   a STUN server located on the public network.

4 NAT Behavior Analogy

   An analogy is provided here to aid in the explanation of how the
   various NATs operate. It is assumed that readers of this document are
   familiar with STUN protocol[1] and have a good understanding of NAT
   behaviors.

   The analogy is presented in terms of a doorman to a building
   (corresponding to a private network) in which a tenant (an endpoint
   device) is present.  A NAT acts just like a wall of the building.
   Until the tenant sends a packet to the outside, there are no doors on
   the wall of the building.  When the tenant in the building sends a
   packet, a door on the wall will be created with a doorman.  The NAT
   behavior can be characterized in different ways depending on the
   doorman's role and the rules that created the door.

   Full-cone NAT:

        A door will be created when a tenant(endpoint) in a building



Takeda                                                          [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Symmetric NAT Traversal using STUN          June 2003


        sends a packet for the first time. In the case of a full-cone
        NAT, the doorman standing at the door checks if each packet
        trying to come in is visiting the tenant who created this door.
        The doorman, however, does not check where each packet
        originates.

   Restricted-cone NAT:

        A door will be created when a tenant(endpoint) in a building
        sends an invitation letter (a packet) for the first time to
        another building. In this case, the doorman will check if each
        person (packet) trying to come in is visiting the tenant who
        created this door. The doorman also checks if visitors came from
        the building that received the invitation letter from the
        tenant.

   Port restricted-cone NAT:

        A door will be created when a tenant(endpoint) in a building
        sends an invitation letter (a packet) for the first time to a
        tenant in another building. The doorman will check if each
        person trying to enter is visiting the tenant who created the
        door.  The doorman also checks if they have received the
        invitation letter from the tenant.

   Symmetric NAT:

        A door will be created every time when a tenant(endpoint) in a
        building sends an invitation letter (a packet) to a new tenant
        in another building. The doorman will check if each one trying
        to come in is visiting the tenant who created the door. The
        doorman also checks if they have received the invitation letter
        sent from him through this door.

        What makes NAT traversal difficult with symmetric NAT is the
        door creation rule.  In other (non-symmetric) cases, the same
        door will be used whenever the same tenant in a building sends
        an invitation packet to a different destination. In symmetric
        NAT , a new door will be always created every time the tenant in
        the building sends an invitation packet. Therefore, when you
        want to talk to Mr.A and Mr.B at the same time, for example, the
        door to let Mr.A enter is always different from the one to let
        Mr.B enter. With STUN, the tenant sends an invitation packet to
        the STUN server (binding request) and the STUN server sends back
        a reply with the location of the door (MAPPED-ADDRESS) used to
        send the invitation, so that the tenant will know which door on
        the NAT can be used for other parties to enter.  However, if the
        NAT is symmetric, the door obtained from the STUN server is not



Takeda                                                          [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Symmetric NAT Traversal using STUN          June 2003


        the same as the door that will be used for other parties to
        enter.

   In this analogy, a 'tenant' is used to represent a local UDP port.
   It should be noted that several tenants comprise a 'company'. The IP
   address represents a company in the 'building'. To recap, each
   building (LAN behind a NAT) has multiple companies (IP addresses)
   made up of many tentants (UDP ports).  The trick to traverse NAT with
   UDP is to utilize the 'invitation letter (packet)".  This will create
   a door for visitors outside the building to come in.  The invitation
   packet is not necessarily a 'special' invitation packet.  The first
   part of data transmission works as an invitation because it creates a
   door and a doorman as a result.  STUN protocol provides us with a way
   to ascertain the doorman's role and the door creation rule.

   The following chart shows combinations of NATs at each endpoint with
   the current NAT type definitions in STUN. The combinations are
   classified into 4 groups: Class I, II, III and IV.

           SYM : Symmetric NAT

                    Figure 5.1 NAT Combination Classification

   Class I is a case in which the receiver does not have a NAT. There is
   no actual NAT issue here because receiver side has no NAT and has a
   routable IP address to receive packets.

   Class II is a case in which the receiver has a non-symmetric NAT and
   the sender has no NAT or any type of NATs except the case in which
   the receiver has a port restricted symmetric NAT and sender has a
   symmetric NAT.  In order to traverse the NAT in this case, the
   receiver sends an invitation packet to the sender so that the doorman
   will not block any packets sent from the receiver of the invitation
   packet.

   Class III involves a symmetric NAT at the receiver. There is a full-
   cone or restricted-cone NAT at the sender side. The problem in this
   case is that STUN is not able to provide a valid MAPPED-ADDRESS of
   the symmetric NAT for EP-S to send packet. EP-S can send an
   invitation packet to the MAPPED-ADDRESS on EP-R side NAT. This will
   cause an existing allocated port on EP-S side NAT to accept incoming
   packets sent from the MAPPED-ADDRESS on the EP-R side NAT.  EP-R will
   also send an invitation packet to EP-S and the EP-S can record the
   source IP address and port number of the received packet to send
   packets back to the recorded address/port. This source address
   recording technique is known as "symmetric RTP"[3],[4].

   Class IV is the case that this document addresses. The problem here
   is that STUN is not able to provide a valid MAPPED-ADDRESS for the
   symmetric NAT.  Therefore, the other endpoint cannot send an
   invitation packet to the symmetric NAT. As a result, the symmetric
   RTP solution is not applicable here either.  A key solution to this
   class IV traversal is to do further analysis on the symmetric NAT and
   make the invalid MAPPED-ADDRESS useful.  The details are described in
   the following sections.




6 More About Symmetric NAT Behavior

6.1 Port Allocation Behavior

   A symmetric NAT allocates different mapping (MAPPED-ADDRESS) when a
   new request is sent to a different destination, although it is sent
   from the same internal IP address and port. In the non-symmetric
   case, the same MAPPED-ADDRESS is always used.  The following is a



Takeda                                                          [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Symmetric NAT Traversal using STUN          June 2003


   typical example of the port assignment behavior of the symmetric NAT.
   In this example, 4 packets (TRY-1 thru -4) are sent to a different
   destination from the same internal IP address and port. TRY-1 and 2
   send a packet to different port numbers of the same IP address. TRY-3
   and -4 do so but to a different IP address from the one in TRY-1 and
   -2.

   [TRY] [FROM]           [TO]             [MAPPED-ADDRESS]

   The symmetric NAT allocates a new MAPPED-ADDRESS, however the
   increment size of its port number, called 'delta p', is, in most
   cases constant.  In the example above, the delta p value is '+1'. It
   is known that delta p takes on another value other than '+1', as in
   the example below.

   [TRY] [FROM]           [TO]             [MAPPED-ADDRESS]

   2     192.168.1.2:4136 65.12.66.10:3479 67.105.12.10:49154 (49152+2)

   With regard to port allocation behavior, since the symmetric NAT
   shown above allocates a new MAPPED-ADDRESS every time a packet is
   sent to a different IP address or port, this allocation behavior is
   called 'port sensitive' allocation.

   It is also known that there is another type of port allocation
   behavior as follows.

   [TRY] [FROM]           [TO]             [MAPPED-ADDRESS]

   This symmetric NAT behaves, in terms of port allocation rule, like a
   cone (non-symmetric) NAT when packets are sent to different ports of
   the same IP address. But when the packets are sent to the different
   IP addresses for the first time, it will assign a new MAPPED-ADDRESS.



Takeda                                                          [Page 7]

   This port allocation rule is called 'address sensitive' allocation.
   Even in this case the port increment size, delta p, is likely to be
   constant.

   The consistency of delta p is very important in order to traverse
   symmetric NAT.  If an IP device behind a symmetric NAT knows the
   value of delta p and its consistency, the IP device can predict the
   next port number to be assigned by the symmetric NAT from the MAPPED-
   ADDRESS. The prediction, however, can fail.

   One of the scenarios for prediction failure would be that another PC
   behind the same symmetric NAT created a new binding during the
   prediction process.  Specifically, if there are multiple network
   applications running behind the same symmetric NAT, ap1 and ap2 shown
   in Figure 6.1 for example, ap1 first obtains a MAPPED-ADDRESS from
   STUN server (t0). Right after, ap2 starts talking to a remote host
   with UDP that causes another binding creation on the NAT (t1). The
   ap1 makes a prediction from the obtained MAPPED-ADDRESS but the
   predicted port number has just been taken by ap2. Eventually, ap1
   sends a packet to a remote host (at t2) but the allocated port by the
   NAT for this transmission is not the one that the ap1 has predicted.

                   Figure 6.1 Prediction Failure Case A

   The critical time period for the correct prediction is between t0 and
   t2.  Prediction failure rate is determined by binding occurrence
   probability by another application behind the same NAT during the
   time period. Success rate can be maximized by minimizing the length
   of the time period.

   Typically, a symmetric NAT allocates a port for a new binding from a
   specific range of ports. (e.g. 0xC000 - 0xCFFF) In most cases, the
   allocation starts from the beginning of the port range and when it



Takeda                                                          [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Symmetric NAT Traversal using STUN          June 2003


   hits the bottom of the range, it will start over from the beginning.

   This port assignment method of NAT is called "incremental
   allocation".  With the incremental allocation, there usually is a
   table that keeps the status of each port in the NAT. The table has a
   status flag that shows whether or not the associated port is in use.
   The symmetric NAT, when a new binding is being created, looks for the
   next available port number by looking at the status flag. If it is in
   use, it will skip the port and look at the next port.  If the
   prediction is made right before the skip occurs, the prediction will
   fail. This may happen if there are a number of IP devices connected
   behind the same NAT and noticeable amounts of UDP transactions are
   being made.

   In contrast to the incremental allocation, there is another
   allocation method, called "queued resource allocation". In this
   method, a predetermined range of port numbers are stored in a queue
   (FIFO) in an orderly fashion at the initial phase.  When a binding
   occurs, a port number will be read from the queue to be allocated for
   the binding. After the binding is released, the port number will be
   returned back into the queue. Since the length of the binding life-
   time varies, the order of the returned port numbers will not be
   continuous. That means, the order of the port numbers in the queue
   will be shuffled gradually and start losing continuity, which makes
   port prediction very difficult.

   Here is a summary for possible reasons for port prediction failure:

   (a) Another binding occurrence between t0 and t2.
   (b) Hit the bottom of the port range. (incremental allocation)
   (c) High UDP usage in the local network.
   (d) Random port allocation (typically with queued resource allocation)

   In order to prevent port prediction failure, the following solutions
   can be taken:

   - Minimize the time length between t0 and t1. - for (a)
   - Implement a retry process. - for (a), (b), (c)
   - Multiple port prediction. (see 8.4) - for (a), (b), (c)

   There is no practical solution for (d) at this moment. There might be
   a way to recover the port number continuity in the queue by
   manipulating allocation and release timings of the bindings of the
   NAT, however, it might have other disruptive factors caused by the
   non-norm NAT world.


6.2 Incoming Packet Filtering

   Another factor that characterizes symmetric NAT behavior is the
   incoming packet filter type. Once a MAPPED-ADDRESS is allocated on
   the symmetric NAT for an internal device, the allocated port will
   accept incoming packets sent from an IP address and port to where the
   device has previously sent packets. There can be a symmetric NAT that
   accepts incoming packets sent from other external endpoints, just
   like a full-cone NAT or a restricted-cone NAT, in terms of incoming
   packet filtering.

   The current STUN discovery process assumes that a symmetric NAT does
   not route incoming packets sent from other IP addresses and/or ports
   other than one to which an internal device previously sent a packet.
   In fact, with the STUN discovery process, a symmetric NAT that
   accepts packets from other IP addresses will result in a full-cone
   NAT.

   The sensitivity, in terms of the incoming packet filter, to a source
   IP address and port number of the incoming packet needs to be
   evaluated as well as the port allocation rule. If the incoming
   packets are examined by the sender's IP address and port number, this
   is called 'port sensitive' filtering.  If the packets are examined by
   the sender's IP address only, it is called, 'address sensitive'
   filtering.


6.3 NAT Characteristics Classification

   As discussed in section 6.1 and 6.2, symmetric behavior can be
   characterized with two parameters as follows:

   (1) Port Allocation Rule (door creation rule)
   (2) Incoming Packet Filter (doorman's role)

   These parameters can be applied to non-symmetric NATs, as well.  The
   following chart shows all the possible NAT characteristics evaluated
   with the two parameters mentioned above.

   All the non-symmetric NATs are categorized as 'cone' NAT. There are
   three types of cone NATs corresponding to the three incoming packet
   filter types.

   The other six NAT types are members of a symmetric NAT defined in
   STUN except Symmetric (a) and symmetric (d). These symmetric types
   are classified as a full-cone NAT. It is assumed in the current STUN
   process that if a packet is received in Test II, it determines that
   the NAT is full-cone without evaluating its port allocation rule. The
   details of this issue are discussed in section 6.5.

   In order to detect the six types of symmetric NATs shown in this
   table, current STUN message definition and its server can be used as
   is.  This symmetric NAT discovery process is described in section 7.


6.4 Exceptional Behavior

   A symmetric NAT has exceptional behavior on port allocation that
   might help NAT traversal. The symmetric NAT allocates a port as well
   as typical symmetric NAT behaviors but this symmetric NAT allocates
   the same port number as its local port number.

   If a device behind this type of NAT knows its behavior, the device
   will be able to detect that the port number to be allocated by this
   symmetric NAT will have the same port number as the local port bound
   in a UDP socket of the device.  In this case, once the device detects
   the type of NAT, it will not perform the binding request to the STUN
   server and use the local port as a global one with a previously
   obtained global IP address from the STUN server.


6.5 Symmetric (a) and (d) and Full-cone NAT

   Symmetric (a) and (d) are types of symmetric NAT, but they behave
   like a full-cone NAT in terms of the incoming packet filtering. STUN
   discovery process with these types of NAT results in full-cone, which
   is fine but it might have a problem if the device (e.g. EP-a) behind
   the NAT needs to send a packet to the other endpoint (EP-b).

   After obtaining a MAPPED-ADDRESS, EP-a tells EP-b the MAPPED-ADDRESS
   so that EP-b can send packets to EP-a via the MAPPED-ADDRESS. If EP-a
   wants to send a packet to EP-b, the packet transmission will cause a
   new port allocation on the NAT because the NAT is actually a
   symmetric NAT. Then EP-b will receive a packet from the new port. EP-
   b believes that it is sending packets to the MAPPED-ADDRESS to talk
   to EP-a, but the packet is coming from a different port than the
   MAPPED-ADDRESS.  This might cause some confusion in EP-b.




7 NAT Characteristics Discovery using STUN

   Current STUN message format and test definitions are used as is in
   order to detect the NAT types defined in Table 6.3.1.

   Test I:   The client sends a STUN Binding Request to a server,
   without any flags set in the CHANGE-REQUEST attribute, and without
   the RESPONSE-ADDRESS attribute.  This causes the server to send the
   response back to the address and port that the request came from.

   Test II:  The client sends a Binding Request with both the "change
   IP" and "change port" flags from the CHANGE-REQUEST attribute set.

   Test III: The client sends a Binding Request with only the "change
   port" flag set.

   It does not require any modification to STUN server, either. The only



Takeda                                                         [Page 12]

   difference is the discovery process flow as described in the
   following sections.


7.1 Incoming Packet Filter Type Discovery

   The client begins by initiating Test I.  If this test yields no
   response, the client knows right away that it is not capable of UDP
   connectivity.  If the test produces a response, the client examines
   the MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute.  If this address and port are the same
   as the local IP address and port of the socket used to send the
   request, the client knows that it is not "natted". The client then
   executes Test II.

   If a response is received during the Test II, the client knows that
   it has open access to the Internet (or, at least, its behind a
   firewall that behaves like a full-cone NAT, but without the
   translation). If no response is received, the client knows its behind
   a symmetric UDP firewall.

   In the event that the IP address and port of the socket did not match
   the MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute in the response to Test I, the client
   knows that it is behind a NAT.

   Specifically, the process up until this point is considered the NAT
   presence discovery process. The following process covers the incoming
   packet filter type discovery that is performed only in situations
   where the client is behind one or more NATs.

   The client performs Test II.  If a response is received, the client
   knows that the NAT that the client is behind has no port filter.  If
   no response is received, the client performs Test III. If a response
   is received, the client is behind a NAT that has an address sensitive
   filter.  If no response is received, the NAT has a port sensitive
   filter.

   situations where the device is found "natted" with a previous NAT
   presence discovery process.  The port allocation rule discovery
   process uses only Test I, but applies it to different combinations of
   IP addresses and ports in order to figure out the port allocation
   characteristics of the NAT.  A STUN server uses 2 different IP
   addresses (Da and Ca) as shown in Table 7.1 and 2 different ports (Dp
   and Cp). This is the minimal set required to discover the allocation
   rule.

   |-------+------------+------------|
   | TRY-4 |     Ca     |     Cp     |
   +---------------------------------+

   Test I is performed 4 times (TRY-1 through TRY-4) per local port.
   Destinations to which the TRY-1 through TRY-4 are performed are shown
   in Table 7.1. This process can be done with the same local port that
   is used in the previous NAT discovery process.  Since TRY-1 has
   already been done in Test I, it can be skipped and testing can begin
   from TRY-2. The client will obtain 4 MAPPED-ADDRESSes from the
   responses. The 4 MAPPED-ADDRESSes are analyzed to determine the port
   allocation rule, the delta p value, and to evaluate consistency.

   To look for consistency, the process can be performed multiple times,
   however, each test should be done from a different local port which
   does not have a NAT binding associated with it.

   The port allocation rule will be determined by looking at the port
   numbers obtained from MAPPED-ADDRESSes. If all port numbers are
   incremented at each test, the port allocation rule is 'Port
   Sensitive'.

   If the port increment size from TRY-1 and TRY-2, and the ones from
   TRY-3 and TRY-4 are always 0, but the incremental size between the
   ones from TRY-2 and TRY-3 are not 0, the port allocation rule is
   'Address Sensitive'.

   The delta p value will be determined as follows:



Takeda                                                         [Page 15]

   Cone NAT:

     If all port numbers of the obtained MAPPED-ADDRESSes are the same,
     the NAT is a 'Cone NAT'.

   Address sensitive allocation:

     The delta p is equal to a port increment size between TRY-2 and
     TRY-3.  If the process is re-done one more time from another local
     port (TRY-5 to TRY-8 as shown in Figure 7.2), delta p should also
     equal to the port increment sizes between TRY-4 and TRY-5 and
     between TRY-6 and TRY-7.

   Port sensitive allocation:

     The delta p is the difference between adjoining port numbers of
     MAPPED-ADDRESSes obatained from testing (TRY-[N+1] and TRY-[N]).

         Figure 7.2 Allocation Discovery Result: Address Sensitive

   Figure 7.2 shows the result of the allocation discovery process with
   a NAT that has an address sensitive allocation rule.  TRY-5 through
   TRY-8 are performed from a different local port than the one used in
   TRY-1 through TRY-4.

   In situations that the internal device could not find the consistency
   with the port increment size for delta p determination, the
   application needs to have an algorithm to determine the delta p value
   based on statistical observation, or to decide to give up obtaining a
   valid delta p.  The device should be able to determine whether or not
   it is address sensitive or port sensitive. The device still has a
   chance to traverse the NAT if the NAT combination class is III as
   described in section 5.

8 Traversing Symmetric NAT

   This section describes how the symmetric NAT traversal (specifically,
   class IV traversal) is accomplished.  To aid in this explanation, the
   following network configuration is used.

   There are two endpoints EP-S and EP-R, for example, that are located
   behind different NATs (NAT-S and NAT-R, respectively) and EP-R wants
   to receive UDP packets from EP-S.

   Both EP-S and EP-R have performed NAT discovery processes and know
   the following attributes of the NAT obtained from the discovery
   processes described in the previous sections.

   o Incoming Packet Filter Type
   o Port Allocation Rule
   o Delta p


8.1 Information To Be Exchanged

   Incoming packet filter type attribute is used to determine whether or
   not an endpoint device needs to send an invitation packet. This
   attribute is not necessary for the other endpoint and need not be
   exchanged.

   When it comes to sending packets (including invitation packets), the
   endpoint needs to know the destination address for the packets. If
   the port allocation rule of the other endpoint is a symmetric type,
   the endpoint needs either to record the source port number of an
   incoming packet or to predict a port number that the symmetric NAT
   will assign, with a MAPPED-ADDRESS obtained from the other endpoint.

   The following items are the required information to be exchanged

   o Port Allocation Rule
   o Delta p (required if port allocation rule is either address
     sensitive or port sensitive)


8.2 EP-R Behavior

   Soon after the information exchange is complete EP-R decides, using
   the obtained information, the following items with regard to an
   invitation packet transmission.

     (1) If an invitation packet needs to be sent.
     (2) Requirement for its repetition.

   (1) is to be decided with port allocation rule of EP-S and incoming
   packet filter type of EP-R as shown in Table 8.1.

   (*1) in Table 8.1 is the case that EP-R mentioned in Figure 8.1 has a
   NAT that has an address sensitive filter.  Although NAT-S is a
   symmetric NAT (the port shown in MAPPED-ADDRESS is invalid), EP-R can
   send a packet to any port of the IP address in the MAPPED-ADDRESS.
   This can be done because the NAT-R's incoming packet filter is not
   sensitive to its source port.

   (*2) If NAT-R has a port sensitive filter and NAT-S is a symmetric
   NAT, EP-R needs to predict a specific port that will be allocated by
   NAT-S later on so that EP-R can send the invitation packet to the
   port.

   The invitation packet is required to be sent repeatedly in case the
   other endpoint (EP-S shown in Figure 8.1) needs to capture the
   invitation packet to record its source port to which EP-S can send
   packets afterwards.

   The reason for the repetition is that when the first invitation
   packet is sent from EP-R, NAT-S might not be ready to route the
   packet to EP-S because EP-S hasn't sent an invitation packet yet.
   Since EP-S needs to capture the packet to record its source port
   number, EP-R has to make sure that EP-S receives the invitation
   packet.

   The condition that EP-R is required to send invitation packets
   repeatedly is when NAT-R follows either address sensitive allocation
   rule or port sensitive allocation rule.

   The retransmission should stop when EP-R starts to receive packets
   from EP-S successfully, or a time-out event set up for error handling
   occurred.

   NOTE: Even if NAT-R has no filter, EP-R has to send the invitation
   packets repeatedly because the purpose of the invitation packet in
   this case is not only for opening the filter on NAT-R for the
   destination but also for informing EP-S of the source port number
   allocated by NAT-R.


8.3 EP-S Behavior

   Soon after the information exchange is complete, EP-S decides, with
   the obtained information, the following items with regard to
   invitation packet transmission:

     (1) If an invitation packet needs to be sent.
     (2) If source port recording is required.

   EP-S only needs to send an invitation packet to EP-R when source port
   recording is required and NAT-S has either address sensitive filter
   or port sensitive filter (Table 8.2).  By sending an invitation
   packet, it opens up the filter (door) at NAT-S to NAT-R so that the
   invitation packet coming from EP-R will be received at EP-S.

   Source port recording is required if and only if NAT-S has either
   address sensitive allocation rule or port sensitive allocation rule.

   (*3) in Table 8.2 is the case in which EP-S mentioned in Figure 8.1
   has a NAT that has an address sensitive filter.  Although NAT-R is a
   symmetric NAT (the port shown in MAPPED-ADDRESS is invalid), EP-S can
   send a packet to any port of the IP address in the MAPPED-ADDRESS.
   This can be done because the incoming packet filter for NAT-S is not
   sensitive to its source port.

   (*4) If NAT-S has a port sensitive filter and NAT-R is a symmetric
   NAT, EP-S needs to predict a specific port that will be allocated by
   NAT-R later on so that EP-S can send the invitation packet to the
   port.


8.4 Increasing Prediction Success Rate

   In order to increase success rate of the port prediction for
   symmetric NATs, invitation packets can be sent to multiple
   destinations that are possible next ports to be allocated by
   symmetric NATs.

   For example, NAT-R has a port sensitive filter and a port sensitive
   allocation rule.  NAT-S has a port sensitive filter and an address
   allocation rule.  In this case, source port recording is required. In
   order for EP-S to capture an invitation packet from EP-R, EP-S sends
   an invitation packet to a predicted port on NAT-R. The prediction is
   typically made by adding delta p to the port number of the MAPPED-
   ADDRESS obtained from EP-R earlier.

   As mentioned in section 6.1, a symmetric NAT might not allocate the
   predicted port number because the port might be in use and skipped to

   the next one (+2 * delta p). For that reason, EP-S can send
   invitation packets not only to +delta p, but also to the next
   possible ports such as +2*delta p, +3*delta p,...as shown below.

        - delta p = 1                 - delta p = 2

         Figure 8.2 Invitation Packets To Multiple Predicted Ports

   Sending invitation packets to multiple predicted ports is possible
   because NAT-S will not create a new port each time it sends an
   invitation packet to NAT-R. This means that if NAT-S is a port
   restricted-cone NAT, the method will still work.

   If NAT-S has a port sensitive allocation rule and a port sensitive
   filter, this additional invitation packet does not help increase the
   success rate.  Each time EP-S sends an invitation packet to a
   different port, EP-S allocates another port. The whole purpose of
   sending invitation packets to multiple ports on NAT-R is to have one
   specific port accept incoming packets from the multiple ports on NAT-
   R.  New allocations on NAT-S defeat this purpose.

   In Figure 8.3, EP-S is sending an invitation packet to multiple ports
   on NAT-R, assuming that when EP-R sends an invitation packet to NAT-
   S, NAT-R will allocate one of these ports (6000 through 6008) for the
   packet. If NAT-R allocated 6004 when EP-R sends an invitation packet
   to 4001 on NAT-S, for example, as NAT-S has port sensitive filter and
   4001 never sent a packet to 6004, it blocks the incoming packet.

   The benefit of knowing which allocation rule (address sensitive or
   port sensitive) a symmetric NAT has is that the discovery of the
   address sensitive allocation rule will increase the success rate of
   the port prediction.
