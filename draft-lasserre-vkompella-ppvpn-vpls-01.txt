   2.  Abstract 
    
   This document describes a  virtual private LAN service (VPLS) 
   solution over MPLS, also known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). 
   VPLS simulates an Ethernet virtual 802.1D bridge [802.1D-ORIG] 
   [802.1D-REV] for a given set of users.  It delivers a layer 2 
   broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding on 
   Ethernet MAC addresses that is closed to a given set of users.  Many 
   VLS services can be supported from a single PE node.

   4.  Overview 
    
   Ethernet has become a predominant technology initially for Local 
   Area Networks (LANs) and now as an access technology, specifically 
   in metropolitan networks. Ethernet ports or IEEE VLANs are dedicated 
   to customers on Provider Edge (PE) routers acting as LERs. Customer 
   traffic gets mapped to a specific MPLS L2 VPN by configuring L2 FECs 
   based upon the input port and/or VLAN.

   Broadcast and multicast services are available over traditional 
   LANs. MPLS does not support such services currently. Sites that 
   belong to the same broadcast domain and that are connected via an 
   MPLS network expect broadcast, multicast and unicast traffic to be 
   forwarded to the proper location(s). This requires MAC address 
   learning/aging on a per LSP basis, packet replication across LSPs 
   for multicast/broadcast traffic and for flooding of unknown unicast 
   destination traffic. 
    
   [MARTINI-ENCAP] defines how to carry L2 PDUs over point-to-point 
   MPLS LSPs, called VC LSPs. Such VC LSPs can be carried across MPLS 
   or GRE tunnels. This document describes extensions to [MARTINI-
   ENCAP] for transporting Ethernet/802.3 and VLAN [802.1Q] traffic 
   across multiple sites that belong to the same L2 broadcast domain. 
   Note that the same model can be applied to other 802.1 technologies. 
   It describes a simple and scalable way to offer Virtual LAN 
   services, including the appropriate flooding of Broadcast, Multicast 
   and unknown unicast destination traffic over MPLS, without the need 
   for address resolution servers or other external servers, as 
   discussed in [VPLS-REQ]. 
    
   The following discussion applies to devices that serve as Label Edge 
   Routers (LERs) on an MPLS network that is VPLS capable. It will not 
   discuss the behavior of transit Label Switch Routers (LSRs) that are 
   considered a part of MPLS network. The MPLS network provides a 
   number of Label Switch Paths (LSPs) that form the basis for 
   connections between LERs attached to the same MPLS network. The 
   resulting set of interconnected LERs forms a private MPLS VPN where 
   each LSP is uniquely identified at each MPLS interface by a label. 
    
   5.  Bridging Model for MPLS 
    
   An MPLS interface acting as a bridge must be able to flood, forward, 
   and filter bridged frames.

   The set of PE devices interconnected via transport tunnels appears 
   as a single 802.1D bridge/switch to customer C1. Each PE device will 
   learn remote MAC addresses on LSPs (and keeps learning directly 
   attached MAC addresses on customer facing ports).  We note here that 
   while this document shows specific examples using MPLS transport 
   tunnels, other tunnels that can be used by pseudo-wires, e.g., GRE, 
   L2TP, IPSEC, etc., can also be used, as long as the sender PE can be 
   identified, since this is used in the learning algorithm. 
    
   The scope of the VPLS lies within the PEs in the service provider 
   network, highlighting the fact that apart from customer service 
   delineation, the form of access to a customer site is not relevant 
   to the VPLS [VPLS-REQ]. 
    
   The PE device is typically an edge router capable of running a 
   signaling protocol and/or routing protocols to exchange VC label 
   information.  In addition, it is capable of setting up transport 
   tunnels to other PEs to deliver VC LSP traffic. 
    
    
   5.1.  Flooding and Forwarding 
    
   Flooding within the service provider network is performed by sending 
   unknown unicast and multicast frames to all relevant PE nodes 
   participating in the VPLS. In the MPLS environment this means 
   sending the PDU through each relevant VC LSP.  
    
   Note that multicast frames do not necessarily have to be sent to all 
   VPN members. For simplicity, the default approach of broadcasting 
   multicast frames can be used. Extensions explaining how to interact 
   with 802.1 GMRP protocol, IGMP snooping and static MAC multicast 
   filters will be discussed in a future revision. 
    
   To forward a frame, a bridge must be able to associate a destination 
   MAC address with a VC LSP. It is unreasonable and perhaps impossible 
   to require bridges to statically configure an association of every 
   possible destination MAC address with a VC LSP. Therefore, VPLS 
   bridges must provide enough information to allow an MPLS interface 
   to dynamically learn about foreign destinations beyond the set of 
   LSRs. To accomplish dynamic learning, a bridged PDU MUST conform to 
   the encapsulation described within [MARTINI-ENCAP]. 
 
    
   5.2.  Address Learning 
    
   Unlike BGP VPNs [BGP-VPN], reachability information does not need to 
   be advertised and distributed via a control plane.  Reachability is 
   obtained by standard learning bridge functions in the data plane.  
    
   Since VC LSPs are uni-directional, two LSPs of opposite directions 
   are required to form a logical bi-directional link. When a new MAC 
    
     
   Lasserre, Kompella et al.                                  [Page 5] 
    
   Internet Draft draft-lasserre-vkompella-ppvpn-vpls-01.txt  Sep 2002 
    
    
   address is learned on an inbound LSP, it needs to be associated with 
   the outbound LSP that is part of the same pair. The state of this 
   logical link can be considered as up as soon as both incoming and 
   outgoing LSPs are established. Similarly, it can be considered as 
   down as soon as one of these two LSPs is torn down. 
   Standard learning, filtering and forwarding actions, as defined in 
   [802.1D-ORIG], [802.1D-REV] and [802.1Q], are required when a 
   logical link state changes. 
    
    
   5.3.  LSP Topology 
    
   PE routers typically run an IGP between them, and are assumed to 
   have the capability to establish MPLS tunnels.  Tunnel LSPs are set 
   up between PEs to aggregate traffic.  VC LSPs are signaled to 
   demultiplex the L2 encapsulated packets that traverse the tunnel 
   LSPs. 
    
   In this Ethernet L2VPN, it becomes the responsibility of the service 
   provider to create the loop free topology, since the PEs have to 
   examine the Layer 2 fields of the packets, unlike Frame Relay or 
   ATM, where the termination point becomes the CE node.  Therefore, 
   for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the topology of a VPLS is 
   a full mesh of tunnel and VC LSPs. 
    
    
   5.4.  Loop free L2 VPN 
    
   For simplicity, a full mesh of LSPs is established between PEs.  
    
   Each PE MUST create a rooted tree to every other PE router that 
   serve the same L2 VPN. Each PE MUST support a "split-horizon" scheme 
   in order to prevent loops, that is, a PE MUST NOT forward traffic 
   from one VC LSP to another in the same VPN (since each PE has direct 
   connectivity to all other PEs in the same VPN). 
    
   Note that customers are allowed to run STP such as when a customer 
   has a back door link used for backup. In such a case STP BPDUs are 
   simply tunneled through the MPLS cloud. 
    
   5.5.  LDP Based Signaling 
    
   In order to establish a full mesh of VC LSPs, all PEs in a VPLS must 
   have a full mesh of LDP sessions. 
    
   Once an LDP session has been formed between two PEs, all VC LSPs are 
   signaled over this session. 
    
   In [MARTINI-SIG], the L2 VPN information is carried in a Label 
   Mapping message sent in downstream unsolicited mode, which contains

   This document defines a new VC type value in addition to the 
   following values already defined in [MARTINI-SIG]:

   0x000A   ATM VPC cell transport 
   0x000B   Ethernet VPLS 
    
   VC types 0x0004 and 0x0005 identify VC LSPs that carry VLAN tagged 
   and untagged Ethernet traffic respectively, for point-to-point 
   connectivity. 
    
   We define a new VC type, Ethernet VPLS, with codepoint 0x000B to 
   identify VC LSPs that carry Ethernet traffic for multipoint 
   connectivity.  The Ethernet VC Type is described below. 
    
   For VC types 0x0001 to 0x000A, The VC ID identifies a particular VC. 
   For the VPLS VC type, the VC ID is a VPN identifier globally unique 
   within a service provider domain.

   identifier, identifying a service emulating a point-to-point virtual

   identifying an emulated LAN segment. 
    
    
   5.6.  Ethernet VPLS VC Type 
   5.6.1.  VPLS Encapsulation actions 
    
   In a VPLS, a customer Ethernet packet without preamble is 
   encapsulated with a header as defined in [MARTINI-ENCAP].  A 
   customer Ethernet packet is defined as follows: 
         
      - If the packet, as it arrives at the PE, has an encapsulation 
        that is used by the local PE as a service delimiter, then that 
        encapsulation is stripped before the packet is sent into the 
        VPLS.  As the packet exits the VPLS, the packet may have a 
        service-delimiting encapsulation inserted. 
         
      - If the packet, as it arrives at the PE, has an encapsulation 
        that is not service delimiting, then it is a customer packet 
        whose encapsulation should not be modified by the VPLS.  This 
        covers, for example, a packet that carries customer specific 
        VLAN-Ids that the service provider neither knows about nor 
        wants to modify. 
 
   By following the above rules, the Ethernet packet that traverses a 
   VPLS is always a customer Ethernet packet.  Note that the two 
   actions, at ingress and egress, of dealing with service delimiters 
   are local actions that neither PE has to signal to the other.  They 
   allow, for example, a mix-and-match of VLAN tagged and untagged 
   services at either end, and do not carry across a VPLS a VLAN tag 
   that may have only local significance.  The service delimiter may be 
   a VC label also, whereby an Ethernet VC given by [MARTINI-ENCAP] can 
   serve as the access side connection into a PE.  An RFC1483 PVC 
   encapsulation could be another service delimiter.  By limiting the 
   scope of locally significant encapsulations to the edge, 
   hierarchical VPLS models can be developed that provide the 
   capability to network-engineer VPLS deployments, as described below. 
 
 
   5.6.2.  VPLS Learning actions 
    
   Learning is done based on the customer Ethernet packet, as defined 
   above.  The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) keeps track of the 
   mapping of customer Ethernet packet addressing and the appropriate 
   VC label to use.  We define two modes of learning: qualified and 
   unqualified learning. 
 
   In qualified learning, the learning decisions at the PE are based on 
   the customer Ethernet packet's MAC address and VLAN tag, if one 
   exists.  If no VLAN tag exists, the default VLAN is assumed.

   Internet Draft draft-lasserre-vkompella-ppvpn-vpls-01.txt  Sep 2002 
    
    
   Effectively, within one VPLS, there are multiple logical FIBs, one 
   for each customer VLAN tag identified in a customer packet. 
 
   In unqualified learning, learning is based on a customer Ethernet 
   packet's MAC address only.  In other words, at any PE, there is only 
   one FIB per VPLS, which maps the MAC address in a customer Ethernet 
   packet to a VC label. 
 
   5.6.3.  VPLS Forwarding actions 
    
   The forwarding decisions taken at a PE couple with the learning 
   mode.  When using unqualified learning, unknown destination packets 
   are flooded to the entire VPLS.  When using qualified learning, the 
   scope of the flooding domain may be reduced (to the scope of the 
   customer VLAN).  How this may be achieved is outside the scope of 
   this draft. 
 
   It is important to ensure that the above learning and forwarding 
   modes are used consistently across the VPLS.  For example, when the 
   intention is to use qualified learning, duplicate MAC addresses with 
   different VLAN tags should not trigger re-learn events, which will 
   lead to incorrect forwarding decisions.  We propose that signaling 
   an optional parameter in the VC FEC will provide an adequate guard 
   against such misconfigurations.  By default, the behavior is 
   unqualified learning. 
    
   In order to signal the learning mode, we introduce a new interface 
   parameter [MARTINI-SIG]. 
    
   Optional Interface Parameter 
        0x06     VPLS Learning Mode 
                 Length: 1 byte. 
                 Value: 0 - unqualified learning 
                        1 - qualified learning 
 
   6.  MAC Address Withdrawal 

   It MAY be desirable to remove MAC addresses that have been 
   dynamically learned for faster convergence. 
    
   We introduce an optional MAC TLV that is used to specify a list of 
   MAC addresses that can be removed using the Address Withdraw 
   Message. 

   The Address Withdraw message with MAC TLVs MAY be supported in order 
   to uninstall learned MAC addresses that have moved or gone away more 
   quickly.  Once a MAC address is unlearned, re-learning occurs 
   through flooding.

   6.1.  MAC TLV 

   MAC addresses to be unlearned can be signaled using an LDP Address 
   Withdraw Message.  We define a new TLV, the MAC TLV.  Its format is 
   described below.  The encoding of a MAC TLV address is a 2-byte 
   802.1Q tag, followed by the 6-byte MAC address encoding specified by 
   IEEE 802 documents [g-ORIG] [802.1D-REV].  The 802.1Q tag and the 
   MAC address MUST appear in pairs.  If no tag is required, the value 
   of the tag field MUST be zero.

        Unknown bit.  This bit MUST be set to 0.  If the MAC address

   be ignored.

        Forward bit.  This bit MUST be set to 0.  Since the LDP 
   mechanism used here is Targeted, the TLV MUST NOT be forwarded.

        The 802.1Q Tag.  The value MUST be zero if the Ethernet VLAN 
   encapsulation is used.  If the Ethernet encapsulation is used, and

   the VLAN tag.  If the Ethernet encapsulation is used, and the MAC

   address is not associated with a VLAN, it MUST be set to zero.  
   Since an 802.1Q tag is 12-bits, the high 4 bits of the field MUST be 
   set to zero. 
    
   MAC Address 
        The MAC address being removed. 

   The LDP Address Withdraw Message contains a FEC TLV (to identify the 
   VPLS in consideration), a MAC Address TLV and optional parameters.  
   No optional parameters have been defined for the MAC Address 
   Withdraw signaling. 

   6.2.  Address Withdraw Message Containing MAC TLV 

   When MAC addresses are being removed explicitly, e.g., an adjacent 
   CE router has been disconnected, an Address Withdraw Message can be 
   sent with the list of MAC addresses to be withdrawn. 

   The processing for MAC TLVs received in an Address Withdraw Message 
   is: 
     For each (VLAN tag, MAC address) pair in the TLV: 
     - Remove the association between the (VLAN tag, MAC address) pair 
        and VC label.  It does not matter whether the MAC address was 
        installed as a static or dynamic address. 

   The scope of a MAC TLV is the VPLS specified in the FEC TLV in the 
   Address Withdraw Message. 
    
   The number of MAC addresses can be deduced from the length field in 
   the TLV.  The address list MAY be empty.  This tells the receiving 
   LSR to delete any MAC addresses learned from the sending LSR for the 
   VPLS specified by the FEC TLV. 
 
   7.  Operation of a VPLS 
    
   We show here an example of how a VPLS works.  The following 
   discussion uses the figure below, where a VPLS has been set up 
   between PE1, PE2 and PE3. 
    
   Initially, the VPLS is set up so that PE1, PE2 and PE3 have a full-
   mesh of tunnels between them for carrying tunneled traffic.  The 
   VPLS service is assigned a VCID (a 32-bit quantity that is unique 
   across the provider network across all VPLSs). (Allocation of 
   domain-wide unique VCIDs is outside the scope of this draft.) 
    
   For the above example, say PE1 signals VC Label 102 to PE2 and 103 
   to PE3, and PE2 signals VC Label 201 to PE1 and 203 to PE3.

   Assume a packet from A1 is bound for A2.  When it leaves CE1, say it 
   has a source MAC address of M1 and a destination MAC of M2.  If PE1 
   does not know where M2 is, it will multicast the packet to PE2 and 
   PE3.  When PE2 receives the packet, it will have an inner label of 
   201.  PE2 can conclude that the source MAC address M1 is behind PE1, 
   since it distributed the label 201 to PE1.  It can therefore 
   associate MAC address M1 with VC Label 102.

   7.1.  MAC Address Aging 
    
   PEs that learn remote MAC addresses need to have an aging mechanism 
   to remove unused entries associated with a VC Label.  This is 
   important both for conservation of memory as well as for 
   administrative purposes.  For example, if a customer site A is shut 
   down, eventually, the other PEs should unlearn A's MAC address.   
    
   As packets arrive, MAC addresses are remembered.  The aging timer 
   for MAC address M SHOULD be reset when a packet is received with 
   source MAC address M. 
    
    
   8.  A Hierarchical VPLS Model 
    
   The solution described above requires a full mesh of tunnel LSPs 
   between all the PE routers that participate in the VPLS service.  
   For each VPLS service, n*(n-1) VCs must be setup between the PE 
   routers.  While this creates signaling overhead, the real detriment 
   to large scale deployment is the packet replication requirements for 
   each provisioned VCs on a PE router.  Hierarchical connectivity, 
   described in this document reduces signaling and replication 
   overhead to allow large scale deployment.

   In many cases, service providers place smaller edge devices in 
   multi-tenant buildings and aggregate them into a PE device in a 
   large Central Office (CO) facility. In some instances, standard IEEE 
   802.1q (Dot 1Q) tagging techniques may be used to facilitate mapping 
   CE interfaces to PE VPLS access points.  When this is done, a 
   hierarchical architecture is created outside the context of VPLS; no 
   service level signaling is present between the PE router and the MTU 
   bridge. 
    
   It is often beneficial to extend the VPLS service tunneling 
   techniques into the MTU domain.  This can be accomplished by 
   treating the MTU device as a PE device and provisioning VCs between 
   it and every other edge, as an basic VPLS.  An alternative is to 
   utilize [MARTINI-ENCAP] VCs between the MTU and selected VPLS 
   enabled PE routers.  This section focuses on this alternative 
   approach.  The [VPLS] mesh core tier VCs (Hub) are augmented with 
   access tier VCs (Spoke) to form a two tier hierarchical VPLS (H-
   VPLS). 
    
   Spoke VCs may be expanded to include any L2 tunneling mechanism, 
   expanding the scope of the first tier to include non-bridging VPLS 
   PE routers. The non-bridging PE router would extend a Spoke VC from 
   a Layer-2 switch that connects to it, through the service core 
   network, to a bridging VPLS PE router supporting Hub VCs.  We also 
   describe how VPLS-challenged nodes and low-end CEs without MPLS 
   capabilities may participate in a hierarchical VPLS. 
    
    
   8.1.  Hierarchical connectivity 
    
   This section describes the hub and spoke connectivity model and 
   describes the requirements of the bridging capable and non-bridging 
   MTU devices for supporting the spoke connections. 
    
   For rest of this discussion we will refer to a bridging capable MTU 
   device as MTU-s and a non-bridging capable PE device as PE-r.  A 
   routing and bridging capable device will be referred to as PE-rs.   
    
    
   8.1.1.  Spoke connectivity for bridging-capable devices 
    
   As shown in the figure below, consider the case where an MTU-s 
   device has a single connection to the PE-rs device placed in the CO.  
   The PE-rs devices are connected in a basic VPLS full mesh.   To 
   participate in the VPLS service, MTU-s device creates a single 
   point-to-point tunnel LSP to the PE-rs device in the CO.  We will 
   call this the spoke connection.  For each VPLS service, a single 
   spoke VC is setup between the MTU-s and the PE-rs based on [MARTINI-
   SIG] and [MARTINI-ENCAP].  Unlike traditional [MARTINI-ENCAP] VCs 
   that terminate on a physical (or a VLAN-tagged logical) port at each 
   end, the spoke VC terminates on a virtual bridge instance on the

   MTU-s and the PE-rs devices.  The MTU-s device and the PE-rs device 
   treat each spoke connection like an access port of the VPLS service. 
   On access ports, the combination of the physical port and the VLAN 
   tag is used to associate the traffic to a VPLS instance while the VC 
   label is used to associate the traffic from the virtual spoke port 
   with a VPLS instance, followed by a standard L2 lookup to identify 
   which customer port the frame needs to be sent to. 
    
   The signaling and association of the spoke connection to the VPLS 
   service may be done by introducing extensions to the LDP signaling 
   as specified in [SHAH-PECE].

   8.1.1.1.  MTU-s Operation 
    
   MTU-s device is defined as a device that supports layer-2 switching 
   functionality and does all the normal bridging functions of learning 
   and replication on all its ports, including the virtual spoke port.  
   Packets to unknown destination are replicated to all ports in the 
   service including the virtual spoke port.  Once the MAC address is

   learned, traffic between CE1 and CE2 will be switched locally by the 
   MTU-s device saving the link capacity of the connection to the PE-
   rs.  Similarly traffic between CE1 or CE2 and any remote destination 
   is switched directly on to the spoke connection and sent to the PE-
   rs over the point-to-point VC LSP.   
    
   Since the MTU-s is bridging capable, only a single VC is required 
   per VPLS instance for any number of access connections in the same 
   VPLS service.  This further reduces the signaling overhead between 
   the MTU-s and PE-rs.   
    
    
   8.1.1.2.  PE-rs Operation 
    
   The PE-rs device is a device that supports all the bridging 
   functions for VPLS service and supports the routing and MPLS 
   encapsulation, i.e. it supports all the functions described in 
   [VPLS].   The operation on the PE-rs node is identical to that 
   described in [VPLS] with one addition.  A point-to-point VC 
   associated with the VPLS is regarded as a virtual port (see 
   discussion in Section 5.6.1 on service delimiting).  The operation 
   on the virtual spoke port is identical to the operation on an access 
   port as described in the earlier section.  As shown in the figure 
   above, each PE-rs device switches traffic between aggregated 
   [MARTINI-ENCAP] VCs that look like virtual ports and the network 
   side VPLS VCs. 
    
    
   8.1.2.  Advantages of spoke connectivity  
    
   Spoke connectivity offers several scaling and operational advantages 
   for creating large scale VPLS implementations, while retaining the 
   ability to offer all the functionality of the VPLS service.  
    
  - Eliminates the need for a full mesh of tunnels and full mesh of 
     VCs per service between all devices participating in the VPLS 
     service. 
  - Minimizes signaling overhead since fewer VC-LSPs are required for 
     the VPLS service. 
  - Segments VPLS nodal discovery.  MTU-s needs to be aware of only 
     the PE-rs node although it is participating in the VPLS service 
     that spans multiple devices.  On the other hand, every VPLS PE-rs 
     must be aware of every other VPLS PE-rs device and all of it’s 
     locally connected MTU-s and PE-r.  
  - Addition of other sites requires configuration of the new MTU-s 
     device but does not require any provisioning of the existing MTU-s 
     devices on that service. 
  - Hierarchical connections can be used to create VPLS service that 
     spans multiple service provider domains. This is explained in a 
     later section.

   8.1.3.  Spoke connectivity for non-bridging devices 
    
   In some cases, a bridging PE-rs device may not be deployed in some 
   CO while a PE-r might already be deployed.  If there is a need to 
   provide VPLS service from the CO where the PE-rs device is not 
   available, the service provider may prefer to use the PE-r device in 
   the interim.  In this section, we explain how a PE-r device that 
   does not support any of the bridging functionality as described in 
   [VPLS] can participate in the VPLS service.

   As shown in this figure, the PE-r device creates a point-to-point 
   tunnel LSP to a PE-rs device.  Then for every access port that needs 
   to participate in a VPLS service, the PE-r device creates a point-
   to-point [MARTINI-ENCAP] VC that terminates on the physical port at 
   the PE-r and terminates on the virtual bridge instance of the VPLS 
   service at the PE-rs.

   8.1.3.1.  PE-r Operation 
    
   The PE-r device is defined as a device that supports routing but 
   does not support any bridging functions.  However, it is capable of 
   setting up [Martini-Encap] VCs between itself and the PE-rs.  For 
   every port that is supported in the VPLS service, a [MARTINI-ENCAP] 
   VC is setup from the PE-r to the PE-rs.  Once the VCs are setup, 
   there is no learning or replication function required on part of the 
   PE-r.  All traffic received on any of the access ports is 
   transmitted on the VC.  Similarly all traffic received on a VC is 
   transmitted to the access port where the VC terminates.  Thus 
   traffic from CE1 destined for CE2 is switched at PE-rs and not at 
   PE-r.   
    
   This approach adds more overhead than the bridging capable (MTU-s) 
   spoke approach since a VC is required for every access port that 
   participates in the service versus a single VC required per service 
   (regardless of access ports) when a MTU-s type device is used.  
   However, this approach offers the advantage of offering a VPLS 
   service in conjunction with a routed internet service without 
   requiring the addition of new MTU device. 
    
    
   8.1.3.2.  PE-rs Operation 
    
   The operation of PE-rs is independent of the type of device at the 
   other end of the spoke connection.  Whether there is a bridging 
   capable device (MTU-s) at the other end of the spoke connection or 
   there is a non-bridging device (PE-r) at the other end of the spoke 
   connection, the operation of PE-rs is exactly the same.  Thus, the 
   spoke connection from the PE-r is treated as a virtual port and the 
   PE-rs device switches traffic between the virtual port, access ports 
   and the network side VPLS VCs once it has learned the MAC addresses. 
    
    
   8.2.  Redundant Spoke Connections 
    
   An obvious weakness of the hub and spoke approach described thus far 
   is that the MTU device has a single connection to the PE-rs device.  
   In case of failure of the connection or the PE-rs device, the MTU 
   device suffers total loss of connectivity.  
    
   In this section we describe how the redundant connections can be 
   provided to avoid total loss of connectivity from the MTU device.  
   The mechanism described is identical for both, MTU-s and PE-r type 
   of devices 
    
   8.2.1.  Dual-homed MTU device 
    
   To protect from connection failure of the VC or the failure of the 
   PE-rs device, the MTU-s device or the PE-r is dual-homed into two

   PE-rs devices, as shown in figure-3.  The PE-rs devices must be part 
   of the same VPLS service instance.    
    
   An MTU-s device will setup two [MARTINI-ENCAP] VCs (one each to PE-
   rs1 and PE-rs2) for each VPLS instances. One of the two VC is 
   designated as primary and is the one that is actively used under 
   normal conditions, while the second VC is designated as secondary 
   and is held in a standby state.  The MTU device negotiates the VC-
   labels for both the primary and secondary VC, but does not use the 
   secondary VC unless the primary VC fails.  Since only one link is 
   active at a given time, a loop does not exist and hence 802.1D 
   spanning tree is not required.

   8.2.2.   Failure detection and recovery 
    
   The MTU-s device controls the usage of the VC links to the PE-rs 
   nodes.  Since LDP signaling is used to negotiate the VC-labels, the 
   hello messages used for the LDP session are used to detect failure 
   of the primary VC.  
    
     
   Lasserre, Kompella et al.                                 [Page 18] 
    
   Internet Draft draft-lasserre-vkompella-ppvpn-vpls-01.txt  Sep 2002 
    
    
    
   Upon failure of the primary VC, MTU-s device immediately switches to 
   the secondary VC.  At this point the PE3-rs device that terminates 
   the secondary VC starts learning MAC addresses on the spoke VC.  All 
   other PE-rs nodes in the network think that CE-1 and CE-2 are behind 
   PE1-rs and may continue to send traffic to PE1-rs until they learn 
   that the devices are now behind PE3-rs.  The relearning process can 
   take a long time and may adversely affect the connectivity of higher 
   level protocols from CE1 and CE2.  To enable faster convergence, the 
   PE1-rs device where the primary VC failed sends out a flush message, 
   using the MAC TLV as defined in Section 6, to all other PE-rs 
   devices participating in the VPLS service.  Upon receiving the 
   message, all PE-rs flush the MAC addresses learned from PE1-rs. 
   8.3.  Multi-domain VPLS service 
    
   Hierarchy can also be used to create a large scale VPLS service 
   within a single domain or a service that spans multiple domains 
   without requiring full mesh connectivity between all VPLS capable 
   devices.   Two fully meshed VPLS networks are connected together 
   using a single LSP tunnel between the VPLS gateway devices.  A 
   single VC is setup per VPLS service to connect the two domains 
   together.  The VPLS gateway device joins two VPLS services together 
   to form a single multi-domain VPLS service.

   10.  Security Considerations 
    
   Security issues resulting from this draft will be discussed in 
   greater depth at a later point.  It is recommended in [RFC3036] that 
   LDP security (authentication) methods be applied.  This would 
   prevent unauthorized participation by a PE in a VPLS.  Traffic 
   separation for a VPLS is effected by using VC labels.  However, for 
   additional levels of security, the customer MAY deploy end-to-end 
   security, which is out of the scope of this draft.
