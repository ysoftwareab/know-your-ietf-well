 Security Considerations for Transient Numeric Identifiers Employed in
                           Network Protocols
              draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations-07

Abstract

   Poor selection of transient numerical identifiers in protocols such
   as the TCP/IP suite has historically led to a number of attacks on
   implementations, ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) to data
   injection and information leakage that can be exploited by pervasive
   monitoring.  To prevent such flaws in future protocols and
   implementations, this document updates RFC 3552, requiring future
   RFCs to contain a vulnerability assessment of their transient numeric
   identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   Network protocols employ a variety of transient numeric identifiers
   for different protocol entities, ranging from DNS Transaction IDs
   (TxIDs) to transport protocol numbers (e.g.  TCP ports) or IPv6
   Interface Identifiers (IIDs).  These identifiers usually have
   specific properties that must be satisfied such that they do not
   result in negative interoperability implications (e.g., uniqueness
   during a specified period of time), and an associated failure
   severity when such properties not met.

   The TCP/IP protocol suite alone has been subject to variety of
   attacks on its transient numeric identifiers over the past 30 years
   or more, with effects ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) or data
   injection, to information leakage that could be exploited for
   pervasive monitoring [RFC7258].  The root of these issues has been,
   in many cases, the poor selection of identifiers in such protocols,
   usually as a result of insufficient or misleading specifications.
   While it is generally trivial to identify an algorithm that can
   satisfy the interoperability requirements for a given identifier,
   there exists practical evidence [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-history]
   that doing so without negatively affecting the security and/or
   privacy properties of the aforementioned protocols is prone to error.

   For example, implementations have been subject to security and/or
   privacy issues resulting from:

   *  Predictable TCP sequence numbers (see e.g.  [Morris1985],
      [Bellovin1989], and [RFC6528])

   *  Predictable transport protocol numbers (see e.g.  [Silbersack2005]
      and [RFC6056])

   *  Predictable IPv4 or IPv6 Fragment Identifiers (see e.g.
      [Sanfilippo1998a], [RFC6274], and [RFC7739])

   *  Predictable IPv6 IIDs (see e.g.  [RFC7217], [RFC7707], and
      [RFC7721])

   *  Predictable DNS TxIDs (see e.g.  [Schuba1993] and [Klein2007])

   Recent history indicates that when new protocols are standardized or
   new protocol implementations are produced, the security and privacy
   properties of the associated identifiers tend to be overlooked and
   inappropriate algorithms to generate such identifiers are either
   suggested in the specification or selected by implementers.  As a
   result, advice in this area is warranted.

   We note that the use of cryptographic techniques for confidentiality
   and authentication may readily mitigate some of the issues arising
   from predictable transient numeric identifiers.  For example,
   cryptographic authentication can readily mitigate data injection
   attacks even in the presence of predictable transient numeric
   identifiers (such as "sequence numbers").  However, use of flawed
   algorithms (such as global counters) for generating transient numeric
   identifiers could still result in information leakages even when
   cryptographic techniques are employed.

   Section 3 provides an overview of common flaws in the specification
   of transient numeric identifiers.  Section 4 provides an overview of
   the implications of predictable transient numeric identifiers.
   Finally, Section 5 provides key guidelines for protocol designers.

2.  Terminology

   Transient Numeric Identifier:
      A data object in a protocol specification that can be used to
      definitely distinguish a protocol object (a datagram, network
      interface, transport protocol endpoint, session, etc) from all
      other objects of the same type, in a given context.  Transient
      numeric identifiers are usually defined as a series of bits, and
      represented using integer values.  These identifiers are typically



Gont & Arce               Expires 5 August 2022                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Security Considerations for IDs       February 2022


      dynamically selected, as opposed to statically-assigned numeric
      identifiers (see e.g.  [IANA-PROT]).  We note that different
      identifiers may have additional requirements or properties
      depending on their specific use in a protocol.  We use the term
      "transient numeric identifier" (or simply "numeric identifier" or
      "identifier" as short forms) as a generic term to refer to any
      data object in a protocol specification that satisfies the
      identification property stated above.

   Failure Severity:
      The consequences of a failure to comply with the interoperability
      requirements of a given identifier.  Severity considers the worst
      potential consequence of a failure, determined by the system
      damage and/or time lost to repair the failure.  In this document
      we define two types of failure severity: "soft" and "hard".

   Hard Failure:
      A hard failure is a non-recoverable condition in which a protocol
      does not operate in the prescribed manner or it operates with
      excessive degradation of service.  For example, an established TCP
      connection that is aborted due to an error condition constitutes,
      from the point of view of the transport protocol, a hard failure,
      since it enters a state from which normal operation cannot be
      recovered.

   Soft Failure:
      A soft failure is a recoverable condition in which a protocol does
      not operate in the prescribed manner but normal operation can be
      resumed automatically in a short period of time.  For example, a
      simple packet-loss event that is subsequently recovered with a
      retransmission can be considered a soft failure.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Issues with the Specification of Transient Numeric Identifiers

   A recent survey of transient numeric identifier usage in protocol
   specifications and implementations
   [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-history] revealed that most of the issues
   discussed in this document arise as a result of one of the following
   conditions:

   *  Protocol specifications that under-specify the requirements for
      their identifiers



Gont & Arce               Expires 5 August 2022                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Security Considerations for IDs       February 2022


   *  Protocol specifications that over-specify their identifiers

   *  Protocol implementations that simply fail to comply with the
      specified requirements

   Both under-specifying and over-specifying identifier contents is
   hazardous.  TCP port numbers and sequence numbers [RFC0793] and DNS
   TxID [RFC1035] were under-specified, leading to implementations that
   used predictable values and thus were vulnerable to numerous off-path
   attacks.  Over-specification, as for IPv6 Interface Identifiers
   (IIDs) [RFC4291] and Fragment Identification values [RFC2460], leaves
   implementations unable to respond to security and privacy issues
   stemming from the mandated algorithm -- IPv6 IIDs need not expose
   privacy-sensitive link-layer addresses, and predictable Fragment
   Identifiers invite the same off-path attacks that plague TCP.

   Finally, there are protocol implementations that simply fail to
   comply with existing protocol specifications.  That is, appropriate
   guidance is provided by the protocol specification (whether the core
   specification or or an update to it), but an implementation simply
   fails to follow such guidance.  For example, some popular operating
   systems (notably Microsoft Windows) still fail to implement
   transport-protocol port randomization, as specified in [RFC6056].

   Clear specification of the interoperability requirements for the
   transient numeric identifiers will help identify possible algorithms
   that could be employed to generate them, and also make evident if
   such identifiers are being over-specified.  A protocol specification
   will usually also benefit from a vulnerability assessment of the
   transient numeric identifiers they specify, to prevent the
   corresponding considerations from being overlooked.

4.  Common Flaws in the Generation of Transient Numeric Identifiers

   This section briefly notes common flaws associated with the
   generation of transient numeric identifiers.  Such common flaws
   include, but are not limited to:

   *  Employing trivial algorithms (e.g. global counters) that result in
      predictable identifiers

   *  Employing the same identifier across contexts in which constancy
      is not required

   *  Re-using identifiers across different protocols or layers of the
      protocol stack





Gont & Arce               Expires 5 August 2022                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Security Considerations for IDs       February 2022


   *  Initializing counters or timers to constant values, when such
      initialization is not required

   *  Employing the same increment space across different contexts

   *  Use of flawed pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).

   Employing trivial algorithms for generating the identifiers means
   that any node that is able to sample such identifiers can easily
   predict future identifiers employed by the victim node.

   When one identifier is employed across contexts where such constancy
   is not needed, activity correlation is made made possible.  For
   example, employing an identifier that is constant across networks
   allows for node tracking across networks.

   Re-using identifiers across different layers or protocols ties the
   security and privacy properties of the protocol re-using the
   identifier to the security and privacy properties of the original
   identifier (over which the protocol re-using the identifier may have
   no control regarding its generation).  Besides, when re-using an
   identifier across protocols from different layers, the goal of of
   isolating the properties of a layer from that of another layer is
   broken, and the vulnerability assessment may be harder to perform,
   since the combined system, rather than each protocol in isolation
   will have to be assessed.

   At times, a protocol needs to convey order information (whether
   sequence, timing, etc.).  In many cases, there is no reason for the
   corresponding counter or timer to be initialized to any specific
   value e.g. at system bootstrap.  Similarly, there may not be a need
   for the difference between successive counted values to be a
   predictable.

   A node that implements a per-context linear function may share the
   increment space among different contexts (please see the "Simple
   Hash-Based Algorithm" in [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation]).
   Sharing the same increment space allows an attacker that can sample
   identifiers in other context to e.g. learn how many identifiers have
   been generated between two sampled values.

   Finally, some implementations have been found to employ flawed PRNGs
   (see e.g.  [Klein2007]).

5.  Vulnerability Assessment Requirements for Transient Numeric
    Identifiers

   Protocol specifications that employ transient numeric identifiers
   SHOULD:

   1.  Clearly specify the interoperability requirements for the
       aforementioned transient numeric identifiers (e.g., required
       properties such as uniqueness, along with the failure severity if
       such properties are not met).

   2.  Provide a vulnerability assessment of the aforementioned
       identifiers.

          Note: Section 8 and Section 9 of
          [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation] provide a general
          vulnerability assessment of transient numeric identifiers,
          along with a vulnerability assessment of common algorithms for
          generating transient numeric identifiers.

   3.  Recommend an algorithm for generating the aforementioned
       transient numeric identifiers that mitigates the vulnerabilities
       identified in the previous step, such as those discussed in
       [I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation].

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document formally updates [RFC3552] such that a vulnerability
   assessment of transient numeric identifiers is performed when writing
   the "Security Considerations" section of future RFCs.
