Abstract
      
    This memo suggests a pragmatic specification for defining the 20-bit
    Flow Label field using a hybrid approach that includes options to
    provide IntServ as well as DiffServ based support for IPv6 Quality of
    Service. It also compares various suggested approaches for defining
    the 20-bit Flow Label field in IPv6 Base Header based on RFC 2460
    (December 1998) and few other drafts. Addressing the IPv6-Multicast-
    QoS issues also becomes possible as a consequence. This draft clearly
    specifies exactly when and how various options are to be used; and in
    case of the MFC, exactly how a specific action might be taken by the
    suggested implementation. Thus the resultant mechanism is fully
    implementable and unambiguous as even the lower-level details have been
    worked out as may be required for actual implementations. The draft
    also has a pointer to an experimental QoS scheme called MultServ.

Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


1. Introduction

    This draft addresses the design and implementation-specific issues 
    pertaining to the Quality of Service (QoS) support in the Flow Label
    field of the IPv6 Base Header. It provides support for IntServ and 
    DiffServ Quality-of-Service. Though the IPv6 Base Header has a 20-bit 
    Flow Label field for QoS implementation purposes, it has not yet been 
    exploited. Very few Internet Drafts address these long-standing issues 
    and attempt to present solutions in the form of a clear specification
    of the 20-bit Flow Label in IPv6. This work attempts to provide an 
    analysis of these definitions and subsequently suggests a modified 
    IPv6 Flow Label specification, which in view of the authors can provide
    an efficient Quality-of-Service.


2. IPv6 Flow Labels

    The IPv6 Flow Label [RFC 2460] is defined as a 20-bit field in the
    IPv6 header which may be used by a source to label sequences of
    packets for which it requests special handling by the IPv6 routers,
    such as non-default quality of service or "real-time" service.
    The nature of that special handling might be conveyed to the routers
    by a control protocol, such as RSVP, or by information within the
    flow's packets themselves, e.g., in a hop-by-hop option.

    The characteristics of IPv6 flows and Flow Labels are given in the 
    Appendix A.1


3. Issues related with IPv6 Flow Label

    According to RFC 1809, the IPv6 specification originally left open a
    number of issues, of which the following are important.

3.1 What should a router do with Flow Labels for which it has no state?

    [RFC 1809] and the author's view suggest that the default rule should
    be that if a router receives a datagram with an unknown Flow Label, it
    treats the datagram as if the Flow Label is zero. Unknown flow labels 
    may also occur if a router crashes and loses its state. As part of
    forwarding, the router will examine any hop-by-hop options and learn
    if the datagram requires special handling.  The options could include
    simply the information that the datagram is to be dropped if the Flow
    Label is unknown or could contain the flow state the router should have.

3.2 How does an internetwork flush old Flow Labels?

    Stale Flow Labels can occur in a number of ways, even if we assume



Rahul Banerjee                                                 [Page 3]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    that the source always sends a message deleting a Flow Label when   
    the source finishes using a Flow.   

    1. The deletion message may be lost before reaching all routers.    

    2. Furthermore, the source may crash before it can send out a Flow
       Label deletion message.    

    The authors of the document suggest the following approach as a
    solution to this problem:

    1. The MRU (Most Recently Used) algorithm should be used for
       maintaining the Flow Labels. At any point of time, the most   
       recently used Labels alone will be kept and the remaining should   
       be flushed.   

    2. Before flushing a label, the router should send an ICMP message
       to the source saying that the particular label is going to be
       flushed. So the source should send a KEEPALIVE Message to the
       router saying not to flush the Flow Label in case the source
       requires the Flow Label to be used again. On the other hand, if
       the source agrees with the router to delete the Flow Label, it
       should send a GOAHEAD Message to the router. On receiving the
       GOAHEAD Message, the router immediately deletes the label for
       that particular source. These messages are also sent to all the
       intermediate routers, so that, those routers can as well flush
       the Flow Labels for that particular source.   

    3. In case, the router does not receive any consent from the
       source, it will re-send the ICMP message for at most two or
       three times. If the router does not receive any reply from the
       source, it can flush the particular Label assuming that the
       Flow Label was not important for the source or any other
       intermediate router. The intermediate routers will also delete
       that Flow Label as they didn't receive any message from the
       source. The policy of sending the ICMP message to the source
       two or three times ensures the proper behavior of the method
       of flushing Flow Labels in case of packet loss. This method
       assumes that the ICMP message would not be lost all the three
       times. Hence, if the router doesn't receive any reply from the
       source even after sending the ICMP message three times, it
       deletes the label.

3.3 Which datagrams should carry non-zero Flow Labels?

    According to RFC 1809, following were some points of basic agreement.

    1. Small exchanges of data should have a zero Flow Label since it
       is not worth creating a flow for a few datagrams.


Rahul Banerjee                                                 [Page 4]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    2. Real-time flows must always have a Flow Label.

    One option specified in [RFC 1809] is to use Flow Labels for all
    long-term TCP connections. The option is not feasible in the view
    of the authors as it will force all the applications on that   
    particular connection to use the Flow Labels which in turn will   
    force routing vendors to deal with cache explosion issue.

3.4 Mutable/Non-mutable IPv6 Flow Label

    The Flow Labels should be non-mutable because of the following
    reasons:

    1. Using mutable Flow Labels would require certain negotiation
    mechanism between neighboring routers, or a certain setup through
    router management or configuration, to make sure that the values or
    the changes made to the Flow Label are known to all the routers on
    the path of the packets, in which the Flow Label changes. On the
    other hand, the non-mutable Flow Labels certainly have the advantage
    of the simplicity implied by such a characteristic.

    2. A mutable Flow Label characteristic goes against the IPv6   
    specification of the Flow Label explained in section 2 and the IPv6
    Flow Label characteristics explained in the coming sections.

3.5 Filtering using Flow Label
     
    If, at all, any filtering has to be done based on the Flow Label
    field in the IPv6 header, the expectation is that the IPv6 Flow
    Label field carries a predictable or well-determined value. This is
    not the case if the Flow Label has randomly chosen values.

    Supporting the arguments given in [draft-conta-ipv6-flow-label-02.txt],
    the authors of this document suggest that the problem of not being able
    to configure load-filtering rules, which are based or are including the
    Flow Label, can be resolved by relaxing IPv6 specification of having a 
    random number in the Flow Label field. Exactly how can it be done has
    been suggested later.


4. A modified specification for the IPv6 Flow Label and related
   implementation mechanism: A hybrid approach suggested by this work

4.1 Overview

    Appendix A.2 gives a comparison on various approaches suggested in
    [draft-conta-ipv6-flow-label-02.txt] on defining the 20-bit Flow Label. 
    This section specifies a modified Flow Label for IPv6 for providing
    efficient Quality of Service that utilizes the results of some of


Rahul Banerjee                                                 [Page 5]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    the works referred in Appendix A.2, extends some of these suggested
    mechanisms and finally presents an integrated hybrid approach.

4.2 Definition of first three bits of the Flow Label

    The hybrid approach suggested in this section includes various  
    approaches which are mentioned in Appendix A.2. The 20-bits of the
    Flow Label should be defined in an appropriate manner so that various
    approaches can be included to produce a more efficient hybrid solution. 
    Hence, for this purpose, the first three bits of the IPv6 Flow Label 
    are used to define the approach used and the next 17 bits are used to
    define the format used in a particular approach.

    Following is the bit pattern for the first 3 bits of Flow Label
    that defines the type of the approach used:

    0 0 0       Default.

    0 0 1       A random number is used to define the Flow Label.

    0 1 0       The value given in the Hop-by-Hop extension header is   
                used instead of the Flow Label.

    0 1 1       PHB ID.

    1 0 0       A format that includes the port number and the protocol   
                in the Flow Label is used.

    1 0 1       A new definition explained later in this section is used.

    1 1 0       Reserved for future use.

    1 1 1       Reserved for future use.


    This definition of Flow Label includes IntServ, DiffServ and other
    approaches for defining the Flow Label. A further explanation of these
    options is provided in the remaining part of this section. The default
    value specifies that the datagram does not need any special Quality of 
    Service.

4.3 Defining the remaining 17 bits of the IPv6 Flow Label

    The remaining 17 bits of the IPv6 Flow Label are defined based on
    the approach defined in the first three bits of the Flow Label.

4.3.1 Random Number

    As specified in IPv6 specification, a random number can be used to


Rahul Banerjee                                                 [Page 6]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    define the Flow Label. Here a 17-bit random number can be used. The
    random numbers can be generated in the range from 1 to 1FFFF. Keeping
    the IPv6 specifications in mind, the authors of this document believe
    that the random number can be used as one of the approaches. As other
    approaches are defined in the Flow Label, this random number approach
    may not be used whenever not feasible or efficient to do so.

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |0 0 1|     Pseudo - Random value       |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.3.2 Using Hop-by-Hop extension header

    As defined in [draft-banerjee-ipv6-quality-service-02.txt], Hop-by-
    Hop extension header can be used for defining the Flow Label in case   
    IntServ is used. In this case the value in the 20-bit Flow Label is
    ignored. The modified Hop-by-Hop extension has been suggested and
    defined in the reference [draft-banerjee-ipv6-quality-service-02.txt].
    In that draft, the Hop-by-Hop extension header has been defined to
    be used with IntServ. This mechanism applies to define for DiffServ as
    well.
     
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |0 1 0|         Don't care              |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.3.3 Using PHB ID

    This defines the DiffServ with MF classifier. In that case the format
    of the Flow Label will be as shown below:
      
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |0 1 1|     DiffServ IPv6 Flow Label    |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    As suggested in [draft-conta-ipv6-flow-label-02.txt], this Flow Label
    can be a PHB ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code). In this case,
    16-bit PHB ID will be used and the remaining 1 bit is reserved for   
    future use.

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |0 1 1|  Per Hop Behavior Ident. Code |R|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      
    'R' is reserved.

    Packets coming into the provider network can be policed based on the
    Flow Label. The provider, based on the SLAs, SLSs, TCAs, TCSs agreed
    with the client, configures MF classifiers. This draft specifies the
    classifier which is little different from the one suggested in the           
    [draft-conta-ipv6-flow-label-02.txt]. The classifier looks like:

    C  = (SA/SAPrefix, DA/DAPrefix, Flow-Label).
    Or   
    C` = (SA/SAPrefix, DA/DAPrefix, Flow-Label-Min: Range).

    The range here specifies the difference between the maximum and the
    minimum Flow Label. The significance of using the range instead of   
    Maximum Flow Label is the reduced number of bits. Definitely the
    difference between the two values can be specified in a lesser number
    of bits as compared to the value itself.

    Flow-Label-Classifier:

    IPv6SourceAddressValue/Prefix:  10:11:12:13:14:15:16:17:18::1/128
    IPv6DestAddressValue/Prefix:    1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8::2/128
    IPv6 Flow Label:                50

    Or

    IPv6SourceAddressValue/Prefix:  10:11:12:13:14:15:16:17:18::1/128
    IPv6DestAddressValue/Prefix:    1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8::2/128
    IPv6 Flow Label:Range:          10:20                       


    Incoming Packet header (SA, DA, Flow Label) is matched against
    classification rules table entry (C or C`).

4.3.4 Using the Port Number and the Protocol

    This approach defines Flow Label by including the server port number and
    the host-to-host protocol. The "Server Port Number" is the port number
    assigned to the server side of the client/server applications. As   
    specified in [draft-conta-ipv6-flow-label-02.txt], this approach   
    reserves 16 bits for the port number and 1 bit for the protocol with   
    the remaining bits reserved for the future use.   

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |1 0 0|    TCP Server port number     |0|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |1 0 0|     UDP Server port number    |1|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    But this approach puts the restriction on the protocol to be used by
    any application.   

    As most of the application seeking Real-time service use TCP or UDP
    as the transport layer protocol, this approach would work fine in most
    of the cases. In case the application requires to use any other host-
    to-host protocol, the other methods for specifying the Flow Label,
    discussed in this section can be used. Anyhow, this method for  
    specifying the port number and the protocol can be exploited further  
    in the future to remove any limitations.

4.3.5 A new structure and mechanism for the use of the Flow Label

    This section describes an innovative approach to define the 20-bit
    Flow Label field in IPv6 header. By the optimal use of the bits in
    the Flow Label, this approach includes various Quality of Service
    parameters in the IPv6 Flow Label that may be requested by any   
    application. The various Quality of Service parameters are:

    1. Bandwidth
    2. Delay or Latency
    3. Jitter
    4. Packet Loss
    5. Buffer Requirements

    As packet loss and the jitter are often desired to be of minimum value   
    by any application, these two parameters may not be defined in the Flow
    Label field itself. Instead, if needed, the Hop-by-Hop EH space can be
    effectively used to specify these parameters. Bits thus saved in the Flow
    Label can be effectively used for more demanding purposes. The Quality
    of Service parameters that are to be included in the Flow Label are:

    1. Bandwidth (to be expressed in multiples of kbps).
    2. Delay     (to be expressed in nanoseconds).
    3. Buffer requirements (to be expressed in bytes).

    As there are only 17 bits left, the optimal use of the bits is very
    important so as to obtain the maximum information out of those 17 bits.
    The first bit out of these 17 bits is used to differentiate between the
    hard real time and soft real time applications. This bit is set to 0 for
    soft real time applications and it is set to 1 for hard real time   
    applications.

    Soft Real time applications:

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |1 0 1|0|      Flow Label               |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    This service is meant for RTT (Real Time Tolerant) or soft real time
    applications, which have an average bandwidth requirement and an
    intermediate end-to-end delay for an arbitrary packet. Even if the
    minimum or maximum values specified in the Flow Label are not exactly
    met, the application can afford to manage with the QoS provided.   

    Hard Real time applications:

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |1 0 1|1|      Flow Label               |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    This service is meant for RTI (Real Time Intolerant) or hard real rime
    applications, which demand minimal latency and jitter. For example, a 
    multicast real time application (videoconferencing). Delay is
    unacceptable and ends should be brought as close as possible.  

    For this videoconference (DTVC) case, the required resource reservations
    are
      a. Constant bandwidth for the application traffic.
      b. Deterministic Minimum delay that can be tolerated.

    These types of applications can decrease delay by increasing demands
    for bandwidth. The minimum or maximum values specified in the Flow   
    Label have to be exactly met for these kind of applications.

    After keeping one bit for Hard/Soft real time applications, we are   
    left with 16 bits for defining the Flow Label. The remaining part   
    of this section discusses how to represent the values of bandwidth,
    delay and buffer requirements.

    1. Bandwidth

    This definition specifies 6 bits out of the 16 bits to be used for
    specifying the bandwidth value. 

    Each value in these six bits corresponds to a pre-defined value for 
    bandwidth. Further explanation about this is given at the end of this 
    section.

    2. Buffer Requirements

    This definition specifies next 5 bits out of the 16 bits to be used for
    specifying the buffer value.

    Each value in these six bits corresponds to a pre-defined value for 
    buffer requirement. Further explanation about this is given at the end
    of this section.

                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    3. Delay

    This definition specifies last 5 bits out of the 16 bits to be used for
    specifying the delay value. 

    Each value in these six bits corresponds to a pre-defined value for 
    delay.

    The approach described here is a DiffServ based mechanism for providing
    the QoS as any packet received by any router is classified based on the
    MF Classifier which is a triplet consisting of the source address,
    destination address and (bandwidth, buffer and delay). The packet that 
    arrives at the router is examined for the values specified in bandwidth, 
    buffer and delay fields and is matched with the classifiers corresponding
    to which the packet is provided with the QoS. The classifier looks like:

    C = (src address, dest address, flow label);
    
    Where flow label = (bandwidth, buffer, delay)
    

    MF Classifier        Bandwidth    Buffer      Delay

5. A possible mechanism for the implementation of the above design.
  
    This section describes one possible mechanism that will allow immediate 
    and practicable implementation of the above design.

5.1 Data structures required (at the router).

    The data structures are specific to the implementations. Different 
    implementations can choose their own data structures that will be
    required to implement the above design.

    Any router that tries to implement QoS maintains a QoS routing table
    and keeps track of the QoS available to each destination through the
    required number of hops [RFC 2676]. Apart from this table, the
    router needs to keep track of the allotted QoS to each and every flow.
    This table is the ALLOTTED_QOS_TABLE.

Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    1. Defining the different approaches.
      
       enum MODEL_ID {
         RANDNUM=1,       // the random number method
         HOPBYHOP=2,      // the hop-by-hop extension header method
         PHB_ID=3,        // the multi-field classifier
         PORT_PROT=4,     // port/protocol method
         HYBRID=5         // the hybrid approach
       };

    2. Defining the different Resource Identifiers.

       enum RES_ID {
         BANDWIDTH=0,     // bandwidth requirement
         DELAY=1,         // delay requirement
         BUFFER=2,        // buffer requirement
       };
  
    3. Defining the value of the resource.

       typedef unsigned int RES_VAL;

       struct RESOURCE {
         RES_ID res_identifier; // identifier of the resource
         RES_VAL res_value;     // 32-bit value of the resource
       };

    4. Defining the Quality of Service.

       struct QOS_INFO {
         MODEL model_id;  
         RESOURCE resource;
       };

    5. Defining the port/protocol and the flow label.

       struct port_protocol {
         unsigned port;      // port number
         unsigned protocol;  // protocol 
       };
     
       union format {
           unsigned flowlabel;             // 20-bit Flow Label value
           struct port_protocol port_prot;
       };

    6.  Defining the packet information.
  
        struct PACKET_INFO {
           struct sockaddr_in6 src_addr;

Rahul Banerjee                                                [Page 12]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


           struct sockaddr_in6 dest_addr;
           union format format_value;
         };

    7. Defining the Alloted QoS table.

       struct ALLOTED_QOS_TABLE {
         struct PACKET_INFO packet;
         struct QOS_INFO qos;
       };

5.2 Function of the Source

    The application specifies the desired QoS and the Flow Label field in
    the IPv6 header is filled based on the QoS asked by the application.
    The application has the flexibility of specifying which format it
    wants to use for getting the desired QoS. It can specify any of the
    formats described in this document. The packet is then put on the
    network and it reaches the intermediate routers

5.3 Function of each relevant intermediate router

5.3.1 Initial Processing (Checks for default service)

    It gets the format used by the packet by reading the first three
    bits of the Flow Label. In case the first three bits are 000 or 110
    or 111, it represents the default service. No specific treatment is 
    required for this particular packet. In this case, no further processing
    of the packet is required and the default QoS is provided to the packet.
    If the value given in the first three bits is 010, no further processing  
    is done and the router knows that the required QoS is specified in the  
    hop-by-hop extension header.

5.3.2 Searching for the entry (In case of non-default service)

    1. The ALLOTTED_QOS_TABLE table is searched based on the source address.
    2. If an entry is found, then for that particular source, a search
       is made based on the PACKET_INFO structure defined above. If all  
       the information stored exactly matches with the information contained
       in the incoming packet, the IPv6 packet is processed so that the  
       reserved QoS is met.
     
5.3.3 New Entry
        
1.	If an entry is not found, a new entry is made in the 
       ALLOTTED_QOS_TABLE table for the source and further processing
       of this new entry is done as follows.
    2. All the relevant structures defined above are filled based on the  
       information contained in the packet. Information about the packet  
       is stored in the PACKET_INFO structure.

Rahul Banerjee                                                [Page 13]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    3. It reads the desired QoS from the packet's header. If the format  
       specifies that a random number is used in the Flow Label field, it  
       reads the RANDOM_NUMBER table. It reads the specified QoS from the 
       table and maintains that in the QOS_INFO structure after updating 
       the RESOURCE structure. It then moves onto step 7.
    4. If the format specifies that PHB ID is used in the Flow Label field,
       it reads the Flow Label and the packet is classified based on the MF 
       classifier described in the previous section and it moves on to the 
       step 7.
    5. If the value in the Flow Label field specifies that the PORT/PROTOCOL
       field is used in defining the QoS required by the packet, it fills the  
       RESOURCE structure and the QOS_INFO structure and moves onto step 7.
    6. If the value in the Flow Label field specifies that the hybrid approach
       is used where the packet specifies the values of the bandwidth, delay
       and buffer requirement. The packet is classified based on the MF 
       classifier described in the previous section and it moves on to the 
       step 7.
    7. It then checks with the QoS Routing table, to find out if the desired
       QoS is possible to be provided to the packet. If yes, it updates the
       new entry in the ALLOTTED_QOS_TABLE table in the memory or else this
       entry is removed.
    8. If any relevant router en-route is not able to guarantee the
       requested QoS, an ICMPv6 message is sent to the source and the
       other routers (that had guaranteed the QoS) are also notified of
       the same so that they delete the corresponding entry from their
       QoS tables.

    This process executes at all the intermediate routers between the
    source and the destination.


6. When to use which approach?

    1. Random Number: This approach supports the pure IntServ based model.
       So if the network uses only IntServ model for QoS, using random 
       numbers in Flow Label is a valid option. But in some conditions
       it is not desirable to use random numbers in Flow Label. If the
       network is required to have a deterministic behavior, using random
       numbers is not a good option as it increases the unpredictability.
       Again, if any load filtering rules have to be designed based on or
       using the Flow Label, random numbers should not be used as the value
       in the Flow Label can not be predicted.

    2. PHB ID: This approach supports the pure DiffServ based model. So
       if the network is designed so as to support DiffServ model for
       QoS, using PHB ID in flow label and using MF classifier as described
       in the previous sections is a valid option.

    3. Hybrid: Again, if the network supports DiffServ model for QoS, using
       this approach is a valid option. Here the application should be 

Rahul Banerjee                                                [Page 14]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


       capable of providing the exact values of bandwidth, delay and buffer
       requirement it needs.

    4. Hop-by-Hop: For using this approach, the application should be capable 
       of specifying the values of QoS parameters. So if the application has 
       these details and the values asked by the application are not supported
       by the hybrid approach, this approach should be used.

    5. Port-Protocol method: If the network is designed so as to perform some
       load filtering based on the port number or the protocol, this approach
       is a valid option.


7. Where other approaches differ in defining the Flow Label from the proposed
   approach


   Few internet drafts have differentiated between the control and forwarding
   plane. [draft-ietf-ipv6-flow-label-00.txt] defines the Control plane as
   part of an IP node taking care of control functions, such as routing
   protocols and flow establishment protocols and Forwarding plane as part
   of an IP node receiving and forwarding IP packets; also known as the 
   "datapath". Having a separation of control plane and forwarding plane does
   have an advantage as explained in that draft. But it may not be completely
   beneficial as the TCP/IP architecture itself is not fully layered. Moreover
   this approach might require some changes in the existing architecture as
   opposed to the proposed solution given in this draft.
   

8. Security Considerations
     
    The specifications of this draft do not raise any new security issues.
    The Flow Label field in the IPv6 header cannot be encrypted because
    of the known reasons. If encrypted, each in between router has to
    decrypt the header for providing the required QoS to the packet. As  
    the QoS specification requires minimum delay for the packet, decrypting
    each packet's header at each router will not be a good idea because of
    the time required in processing the packet.

9. Conclusion

    This report has dealt extensively with all the suggested formats for
    defining the 20-bit IPv6 Flow Label and finally has suggested a
    hybrid approach for efficiently defining the 20-bit IPv6 Flow Label.
    
    One of the major reasons why the current solution proposed in this draft
    provides choice for IntServ/DiffServ based quality of service is the fact
    that a few representative research experiments in many places including
    those in Europe ( www.bits-pilani.ac.in/ngni) have shown that while

                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    DiffServ is definitely an attractive solution due to its scalability, 
    IntServ has been found to be fair and reasonably efficient under a real
    life situation constraints that were stimulated in these experiments.
  
    In the meanwhile, yet another Quality of Service approach is gradually
    evolving (Appendix A.3) that aims to provide a seamless application
    transparency based solution to provide end-to-end quality of service
    support. Inspired from the initiative in the distributed operating system
    research and policy-based QoS mechanisms,this approach is still evolving 
    and refined. It is hoped that once this approach becomes verifiable and   
    viable, an alternate protocol independent quality of service strategy shall 
    be possible to be implemented in the near future.
    
    The emphasis of this work is to result into a practically acceptable  
    specification that could be effectively used for a reasonably long
    period of time for implementing IPv6 Quality of Service that so far
    has been elusive in absence of a clear, verifiable and complete  
    specification. A separate ID is under preparation specifically building  
    upon these specifications so as to explicitly address the scalability
    issues related to the IPv6-Multicast-QoS.

Appendix

A.1. Characteristics of IPv6 flows and Flow Labels

    The characteristics of IPv6 flows and Flow Labels as given in RFC 2460
    are rearranged as follows:

    (a) A flow is uniquely identified by the combination of a source
        address and a non-zero Flow Label.

    (b) Packets that do not belong to a flow carry a Flow Label of zero.

    (c) A Flow Label is assigned to a flow by the Flow's source node.

    (d) New Flow Labels must be chosen (pseudo) randomly and uniformly
        from the range 1 to FFFFF hex. The purpose of the random
        allocation is to make any set of bits within the Flow Label
        field suitable for use as a hash key by routers, for looking
        up the state associated with the flow.

    (e) All packets belonging to the same flow must be sent with the  
        same source address, destination address, and Flow Label.

    (f) If packets of flow include a Hop-by-Hop options header, then
        they all must be originated with the same Hop-by-Hop options

    (g) If packets of a flow include a routing header, then they all
        must be originated with the same contents in all extension
        headers up to and including the routing header.
        header contents.

    (h) The maximum's lifetime of any flow-handling state established   
        along a flow's path must be specified as part of the description
        of the state-establishment mechanism, e.g., the resource  
        reservation protocol or the flow-setup hop-by-hop option.

    (i) The source must not reuse a Flow Label for a new flow within the
        maximum lifetime of any flow-handling state that might have been
        established for the prior use of that Flow Label.


A.2. Comparison of already suggested approaches in defining the IPv6 Flow
     Label format

    This section discusses the already suggested approaches in [draft-conta-
    ipv6-flow-label-02.txt] for defining the 20-bit Flow Label. It discusses
    the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. Finally it tells
    about accepting or not preferring these approaches and includes the

Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    accepted approaches (with modifications wherever required) in the final
    definition of the Flow Label discussed in the next section.

A.2.1 First approach

    Following format can be used for the Flow Label:

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        | 0 |   Pseudo - Random value               |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        | 1 |   DiffServ IPv6 Flow Label            |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    The DiffServ IPv6 Flow Label is a number that is constructed based
    on the Differentiated services "Per Hop Behavior Identification
    Code".
   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        | 1 |   Per Hop Behavior Ident. Code|  Res. |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   

    The "Res" bits are reserved.
      
    The PHB ID is either directly derived from a standard differentiated  
    services code point, or it is an "IANA Assigned Value".   

    Advantages:

    Preserves compatibility with the random number method of selecting
    a Flow Label value defined in IPv6 specification.

    Captures the differentiated services treatment intended to be   
    applied to the packet.

    Unlike the value of the traffic class field, it is not locally
    mapped and hence suitable for use in an end-to-end header field.

    Disadvantages:

    It captures less information than the port number and protocol
    number normally used in multi field classifier.

A.2.2 Second Approach

    DiffServ with multi field classifier can be used in a more efficient
    and practical manner as an alternative to IntServ and RSVP. The Flow



Rahul Banerjee                                                [Page 18]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    Label classifier is basically a 3-element tuple - source and
    destination address and IPv6 Flow Label.

    The classifier can be defined in any of the following two ways:

    C = (SA, SAPrefix, DA, DAPrefix, Flow Label).

    C` = (SA, SAPrefix, DA, DAPrefix, Flow Label min: Flow Label max).

    Incoming packet header (SA, DA, Flow Label) is matched with
    classification rules table entry C or C`.

    Advantages:

    Helps the IPv6 Flow Label to achieve, as it is supposed, in a more
    efficient processing of packets in QoS engines in IPv6 forwarding
    devices.

    Disadvantages:

    When packets are transmitted, the end nodes have to force the
    correct Flow Label in the IPv6 headers of outgoing packets or the
    first hop routers have to do this job. To accomplish these rules,   
    these routers will be configured with MF classifiers. This puts
    extra computations to be done by the routers.

A.2.3 Third approach

    Includes the algorithmic mapping of the port numbers and protocol
    into the Flow Label. It reserves 12 bits for the port number and 8
    bits for the protocol.

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        | Server port number   | H-to-H protocol|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Advantages:

    Classification rule is 5 or 6 element tuple format of a DiffServ MF
    classifier, containing the source and the destination address, the
    source and the destination ports, the host-to-host protocol. So no
    new classification rule format is needed.

    Disadvantages:

    It cannot differentiate among multiple instances of the same
    application running on the same two communication end nodes.

    The reduced number of bits (12 out of 16) limits the value of ports.
    12 bits can represent only the "IANA well-known ports", that is from
    1 to 1023 and a subset of "IANA registered ports", that is from 1024
    to 4095. Registered ports have values between 1024 and 65535.

A.2.4 Fourth approach

    The field occupied by host-to-host protocol could be reduced to 1,
    as TCP and UDP are the only well known protocols.

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |    TCP Server port number      |Res |0|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |    UDP Server port number      |Res |1|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


    The "Res" bits are reserved.

    The "TCP Server Port Number" or "UDP Server Port Number" is the 16-
    bit port number assigned to the server side of the client/server
    application.

    Advantages:

    Again the classification field is a 5 or 6 element tuple. So no new
    classification rule is needed.

    This approach keeps 16 bits for the port number so that all the
    "IANA well-known ports" and "IANA registered ports" can be
    accommodated in these 16 bits.

    Disadvantages:

    This approach, too, cannot differentiate among multiple instances
    of the same application running on the same two communication end
    nodes.

    Reserving only 1 bit for the protocol field in the Flow Label
    restricts the use of any protocol other than TCP and UDP.

A.2.5 Fifth approach

    Header length format:

    Another possible solution is to store the length of IPv6 headers

Rahul Banerjee                                                [Page 20]
Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.


    length that is the length of the IPv6 Base Headers and IPv6   
    extension headers preceding the host-to-host or transport header.
    The length of IPv6 headers in the Flow Label value would provide   
    the information, which a DiffServ QoS engine classifier could use
    to locate and fetch the source and destination ports and apply   
    those along with the source and destination address and host-to-
    host protocol from the Flow Label, to match the source and   
    destination address, the source and destination ports and the
    protocol identifier elements of a DiffServ MF classifier.

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |Length of IPv6 headers| H-to-H protocol|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Advantages:

    "Length of IPv6 headers" allows skipping the IPv6 headers to access
    directly the host-by-host header for other purposes. This format is
    useful for classifying packets that are not TCP or UDP, and have no
    source and destination ports.

    Disadvantages:

    IPv6 header does not include "Total Headers Length" field. So
    introducing this new field in the Flow Label puts extra computation
    to be done that may result in the processing delays.

    Including "Length of IPv6 headers" in the Flow Label does not carry
    any significance in case ESP is used for IP Security.

    This approach is not preferred because of the reasons given above.
    Again, it does not carry any direct advantage in keeping the
    "Length of IPv6 headers" in the Flow Label.


A.3. Recent works in progress
    
    An emerging packet switched QoS approach for providing end-to-end 
    quality of service transparent to the application programs is in the
    verge of becoming a realistic solution for the IPv6 based WAN-QoS
    requirements. Known as MultServ, this approach finds its inspiration
    from the initiatives and the results of the distributed operating
    system research. Some fundamental initial work has been done by the
    IPv6-QoS research group at the Center for Software Development, BITS,
    Pilani (India).(http://ipv6.bits-pilani.ac.in/ngni/NGNI-MMI-QoS-D4-
    v1.3-secure.pdf). It is expected that an IETF document shall soon be
    submitted to the QoS community for their inputs and review of the 
    emergent approach.

A.4. QoS through policy based protocol implementation
    
    For quite sometime now , an interesting and promising approach that is
    generic in nature has been suggested and even implemented in parts in 
    terms of quality of service. This approach called policy based control
    protocol has already one standardized protocol known as Common Open
    Policy Service (COPS). COPS implementation has been available in
    several newer routers. Ths policy based quality of service framework
    permits the network administrators to define QoS Policies that 
    explicitly define rules pertaining to handling aggregated flows at a
    network node known as the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP). The policy
    servers known as the Policy Decision Point (PDP) computes or determine
    the exact QoS enforcement action to be taken on the policy-classified
    packets to be executed at the PEPs. Although very useful, this approach
    exhibits certain basic flaws. For instance, PDPs could be the point of
    failures and building redundancy by providing more PDPs may lead to
    network degradation (due to possible overheads and synchronisation
    issues) unless it is very carefully designed. [Qos_pol113]

    Acutally this policy based QoS solution augments the DiffServ approach,
    since in this case the PDPs are expected to map the flow information
    to specific DiffServ traffic conditioning action meta data which is
    communicated back to PEP; which thereafter uses this information for
    future processing. However this approach has one advantage that
    qualifies for an honourable slot in the QoS strategies and that is
    because such a mechanism does not require the application themselves
    to be QoS aware. This also happens to be the strong point of the 
    MultServ approach, but it does not operate on the client-server
    methodology. 

    The Quality of Service has one aspect called C&A (Charging and
    Accounting) which the commercial providers of the service require to
    support in case they have to charge their customers on the basis of
    QoS requirements. As of now, most of these service providers either
    do not provide QoS or provide certain flat tariff rates based on the
    explicit choices made by the customers that requires the customers to
    be QoS aware. All this is due to the fact that there is no C&A
    provision in the majority of the proposed mechanisms pertaining to QoS.

    The management of the QoS capable networks (QoS WANs) is yet another
    area that has not been adequately addressed by most of the existing
    proposed QoS mechanisms (with or without IPv6). The key problem here is
    that since the routers do offer a variety of packet handling mechanisms,
    the operator has to specifically select and combine the required traffic
    conditioning components at the Edge Routers and even at the Core Routers
    at the service provider's end. Although the aggregated end-to-end flow
    can be implemented in such cases, the task to define the exact router
    configuration remains an increasing complex job particularlyy in wide area
    heterogeneous networks. A related issue is scalability of management of
    such QoS-capable networks.

Internet Draft   A Modified Specification for use of the     April 2002
                 IPv6 Flow Label for providing efficient   
                 Quality of Service using hybrid approach.

    
    The abovementioned issues are the two areas that are specifically
    being attempted to be addressed as built-in features of the MultServ
    quality of service mechanism, which may eventually be implemented in
    IPv6 WANs and which will not require any major change in the basic
    protocol itself.
