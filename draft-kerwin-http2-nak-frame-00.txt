1.  Introduction

   Out of the box, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)
   [RFC7540] makes provision for extension frame types to be sent on a
   connection, with or without prior agreement from either or both
   peers, with the assertion that "implementations MUST discard frames
   that have unknown or unsupported types" ([RFC7540], Section 5.5).
   However it can be useful to explicitly notify the peer if such a
   frame is discarded.

   This document defines an extension to HTTP/2 that allows a peer to
   signal that a received frame was discarded, without altering the
   stream or connection state ([RFC7540], Section 5.1), and in
   particular without triggering an error condition.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Additions to HTTP/2

   This document introduces a new HTTP/2 frame type ([RFC7540],
   Section 11.2).

2.1.  DROPPED_FRAME

   DROPPED_FRAME frames (type code=0xTBA) can be sent on a connection at
   any time to indicate that a received frame was discarded without any
   action being taken.

     +---------------+
     |   Type (8)    |
     +---------------+

                        DROPPED_FRAME Frame Payload

   The DROPPED_FRAME frame contains a single 8-bit integer containing
   the value of the Type field from the discarded frame.

   The DROPPED_FRAME frame does not define any flags.

   An endpoint SHOULD send a DROPPED_FRAME frame for an unknown or
   unsupported frame type the first time it discards such a frame.

   An endpoint MAY send a DROPPED_FRAME frame for a particular incoming
   frame type only once, even if it discards multiple frames of that
   type.

   An endpoint that receives a DROPPED_FRAME frame ought to take it as
   an indication that the extension is not supported by the peer, and
   MAY subsequently choose to not send further frames of that type to or
   to enter into extension negotiations with the peer.

   DROPPED_FRAME frames are not associated with any individual stream.
   If a DROPPED_FRAME frame is received with a stream identifier field
   value other than 0x0, the recipient MUST respond with a connection
   error ([RFC7540], Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   Receipt of a DROPPED_FRAME frame with a length field value other than
   1 MUST be treated as a connection error ([RFC7540], Section 5.4.1) of
   type FRAME_SIZE_ERROR.

3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any new security
   considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the registriy for frame types in the "Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 2 Parameters" section.

4.1.  HTTP/2 Frame Type Registry Update

   This document updates the "HTTP/2 Frame Type" registry ([RFC7540],
   Section 11.2).  The entries in the following table are registered by
   this document.

                  +---------------+------+-------------+
                  | Frame Type    | Code | Section     |
                  +---------------+------+-------------+
                  | DROPPED_FRAME | TBD  | Section 2.1 |
                  +---------------+------+-------------+
