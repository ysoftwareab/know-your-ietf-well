1.  Introduction

   This document describes an IRIS registry schema for Internet domain
   registries using an XML Schema [4] derived from and using the IRIS
   [5] schema.  The query and result types outlined in this document are
   based on the functional requirements described in CRISP [17].

   The schema given is this document is specified using the Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as described in XML [1], XML Schema
   notation as described in XML_SD [3] and XML_SS [4], and XML
   Namespaces as described in XML_NS [2].

   Examples of client/server XML exchanges with this registry type are
   available in Appendix A.

2.  Document Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [10].

3.  Schema Description

   IRIS requires the derivation of both query and result elements by a
   registry schemas.  These descriptions follow.

   References to XML elements with no namespace qualifier are from the
   schema defined in Section 4.  References to elements and attributes
   with the "iris" XML namespace qualifier are from the schema defined
   in IRIS [5].

   The descriptions contained within this section refer to XML elements
   and attributes and their relation to the exchange of data within the
   protocol.  These descriptions also contain specifications outside the
   scope of the formal XML syntax.  Therefore, this section will use
   terms defined by RFC 2119 [10] to describe the specification outside
   the scope of the formal XML syntax.  While reading this section,
   please reference Section 4 for needed details on the formal XML
   syntax.

3.1  Query Derivatives

3.1.1  <findRegistrarsByName> Query

   <findRegistrarsByName> searches for a registration authority
   designated as a registrar for the registry of the server.

   If present, the <baseDomain> element MUST restrict the results of the
   search to only registrars capable of registering subdomains in the
   domain signified by the content of this element.

   The <namePart> element restricts the scope of the query with its
   child elements.  The <beginsWith> element specifies the beginning of
   the registrar's name.  The <endsWith> element specifies the end of
   the registrar's name.  The <exactMatch> element specifies an
   equivalence to the registrar's name.

   If the <namePart> element is not present, the query MUST return all
   registrars applicable (i.e.  in consideration of <baseDomain>).

   This query MUST return a result set of zero or more
   <registrationAuthority> elements.  See Section 3.2.5.

3.1.2  <findDomainsByContact> Query

   <findDomainsByContact> finds domains by searches on fields associated
   with a domain's contact.  A search constraint of <baseDomain> MUST
   restrict the results to domains only underneath the domain specified
   by its content if it is present.

Internet-Draft                 iris-dreg                       July 2004


   The allowable search fields are handled with either the
   <contactHandle> element or one of the elements in the
   "contactSearchGroup" (see Section 3.1.7).  The <contactHandle>
   element allows for the domains to be selected based on the contact
   having the specified contact handle.

   The query MAY also be constrained further using the optional <role>
   element.  The contents of this element signify the role the contact
   has with the domain.

   This query also provides optional <language> elements containing
   language tags.  Clients MAY use these elements to give a hint about
   the natural language(s) of the affected element.  Servers MAY use
   this information in processing the query, such as tailoring
   normalization routines to aid in more effective searches.

3.1.3  <findDomainsByName> Query

   The <findDomainsByName> query finds domains by the name of a domain
   as it is known in DNS.  The <namePart> element restricts the scope of
   the query with its child elements.  The <beginsWith> element
   specifies the beginning of the domain name.  The <endsWith> element
   specifies the end of the domain name.

3.1.4  <findDomainsByIDN> Query

   This query differs from the <findDomainsByName> query by allowing the
   scope of the query to take into consideration internationalized
   domain names.  This query will return the union of the desired domain
   and any associated variants, therefore differing from a lookup in the
   "idn" entity class (Section 3.4) (which is to only return the domain
   or no results).

   The <namePart> element restricts the scope of the query with its
   child element.  Its child, the <exactMatch> element, is designed to
   contain IDNs and not ACE labels, and thus MUST match only against
   equivalent IDNs, according to the notion of equivalence defined in
   RFC 3490 [14].

   This query also provides optional <language> elements containing
   language tags.  Clients MAY use these elements to give a hint about
   the natural language(s) of the affected element.  Servers MAY use
   this information in processing the query, such as tailoring
   normalization routines to aid in more effective searches.

3.1.5  <findContacts> Query

   <findContacts> searches for contacts given search constraints.

   The allowable search fields are handled by one of the elements in the
   "contactSearchGroup" (see Section 3.1.7).

   This query also provides optional <language> elements containing
   language tags.  Clients MAY use these elements to give a hint about
   the natural language(s) of the affected element.  Servers MAY use
   this information in processing the query, such as tailoring
   normalization routines to aid in more effective searches.

3.1.6  <findDomainsByHost> Query

   This query does a simple search for the domains being hosted by a
   name server.  The search is constrained using either the host name
   [12], host handle, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address of the name server.

3.1.7  Contact Search Group

   Some of the queries above have similar query constraints for
   searching on contacts.  This section describes those common
   parameters.

   <commonName> allows the query to be constrained based on the common
   name of the contact.  The constraint can either constrain the query
   by an exact match using the <exactMatch> element, or it may constrain
   the query by a subset of the common name using the <beginsWith> and
   <endsWith> elements.

   <organization> allows the query to be constrained based on the
   organization name of the contact.  It has the same semantics as the
   <commonName> element.

   <eMail> constrains the query based on the e-mail address of the
   contact.  This may be done by an exact e-mail address using the
   <exactMatch> element or by any e-mail address in a domain using the
   <inDomain> element.  The <inDomain> MUST only contain a valid domain
   name (i.e.  no '@' symbol), and the matching SHOULD take place only
   on the domain given (i.e.  no partial matches with respect to
   substrings or parent domains).  If either the contents of the
   <inDomain> element or domain part of the contents of the <exactMatch>
   element contain a name with non-ASCII characters, they MUST be
   normalized according to the processes of RFC 3491 [15].

   The <city>, <region>, and <postalCode> elements restrict the scope of
   the query based on the city, region, or postal code of the contact,
   respectively.  Each one must only contain an <exactMatch> element
   containing the exact city, region, or postal code (i.e.  no substring
   searches).

3.2  Result Derivatives

3.2.1  Privacy Labels

   Several of the results in this registry type have values that cannot
   be given but must be specified as present or must be flagged so that
   clients do not divulge them.  In order to achieve this, some of the
   results use the following element types:
   o  "dateTimePrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data type
      "dateTime".  The contents of this element MUST be specified using
      the 'Z' indicator for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
   o  "stringPrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data type
      "string".
   o  "normalizedStringPrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data
      type "normalizedString".
   o  "tokenPrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data type
      "token".
   o  "domainStatusType" - contains an optional element of <appliedDate>
      indicating the date and time the status was applied and an
      optional element of <description> with required attribute
      'language' indicating a description of the status.  This element
      also has an optional attribute of 'scope' to indicate the scope or
      origin of the status value.
   o  "contactTypeType" - contains an optional <description> child
      elements.  Each <description> child element requires a 'language'
      attribute.

   As specified, they are nillable and therefore may be present with
   empty content or present with their specified content.  The use of
   these elements is also optional.

   If present without content, each of these element types MUST have one
   or more of the following boolean attributes:
   o  'private' - if true, this specifies that the content is absent
      because it may never be published.
   o  'denied' - if true, this specifies that the content is absent
      because policy does not allow it to be given under the current
      level of access.

   If present with content, each of these element types MAY have one or
   more of the following boolean attributes:
   o  'doNotRedistribute' - if true, this specifies that the content is
      not to be redistributed.
   o  'specialAccess' - if true, this specifies that the content has
      been provided due to special access rights.

   These boolean attributes SHOULD be used in accordance with the level
   of access being granted the recepient of the data.  For example,

   marking data as 'private' or 'denied' is to be expected if the user
   is anonymous or has some other low level of access that does not
   warrant viewing of that particular data.  Likewise, data marked with
   'doNotRedistribute' or 'specialAccess' is to be expected if the user
   is authenticated and has a high level of access.

3.2.2  <domain> Result

   An example of a <domain> result:

   <domain
     authority="iana.org" registryType="dreg1"
     entityClass="domain-handle" entityName="example-com-1">
     <domainName>example.com</domainName>
     <domainHandle>tcs-com-1</domainHandle>
     <nameServer
       iris:referentType="host"
       authority="iana.org" registryType="dreg1"
       entityClass="host-handle" entityName="research7" />
     <nameServer
       iris:referentType="host"
       authority="iana.org" registryType="dreg1"
       entityClass="host-handle" entityName="nsol184" />
     <registry
       iris:referentType="registrationAuthority"
       authority="com"
       registryType="dreg1"
       entityClass="contact-handle"
       entityName="VGRS" />
     <registrar
       iris:referentType="registrationAuthority"
       authority="iana.org" registryType="dreg1"
       entityClass="contact-handle" entityName="dbarton" />
     <initialDelegationDateTime xsi:nil="true"/>
   </domain>

   The <domain> result represents an instance of a domain assignment.
   The children of the <domain> element are as follows:
   o  <domainName> - the full name of the domain as it is in DNS.  The
      contents of this element MUST be a domain name as specified by RFC
      1035 [9].
   o  <idn> - the name of the domain in nameprep form if applicable.
      See RFC 3491 [15].
   o  <domainHandle> - a registry unique assigned identifier to a
      domain.
   o  <nameServer> - MUST contain an entity reference to a referent of
      type <host> (Section 3.2.3).

Internet-Draft                 iris-dreg                       July 2004


   o  <registrant> - an element containing an entity reference to the
      registrant of this domain.  The referent MUST be a <contact>
      (Section 3.2.4) result.
   o  Domain contacts - the following elements contain an entity
      reference with a relationship to the domain.  The referent of each
      MUST be a <contact> (Section 3.2.4).
      *  <billingContacts>
      *  <technicalContacts>
      *  <administrativeContacts>
      *  <legalContacts>
      *  <zoneContacts>
      *  <abuseContacts>
      *  <securityContacts>
      *  <otherContacts>
   o  <status> - may contain at least one of the following elements of
      type 'domainStatusType' (see Section 3.2.1), but none of these
      elements may appear more than once.
      *  <reservedDelegation> - permanently inactive
      *  <assignedAndActive> - normal state
      *  <assignedAndInactive> - registration assigned but delegation
         inactive
      *  <assignedAndOnHold> - dispute
      *  <revoked> - database purge pending
      *  <transferPending> - change of authority pending
      *  <registryLock> - on hold by registry
      *  <registrarLock> - on hold by registrar
   o  <domainVariant> - contains an entity reference, the referent of
      which MUST be a <domain> (Section 3.2.2).
   o  <registrationReference> - an element containing an entity
      reference, the referent of which MUST be a <domain> (Section
      3.2.2).  The intention of this element is to point to the
      downstream registration reference.  Therefore, if this is a result
      given back by a domain registry, it should point to the domain in
      the domain registrar or registrant service.
   o  <registry> - contains an entity reference specifying the domain
      registry operator for this domain which MUST be a
      <registrationAuthority> (Section 3.2.5).  This element has an
      optional, boolean 'hosting' attribute.  When the value of this
      attribute is positive, it indicates that the registry is
      responsible for authoratively answering DNS queries for this
      domain.
   o  <registrar> - contains an entity reference specifying the domain
      registrar operator for this domain which MUST be a
      <registrationAuthority> (Section 3.2.5).  This element has an
      optional, boolean 'hosting' attribute.  When the value of this
      attribute is positive, it indicates that the registrar is
      responsible for authoratively answering DNS queries for this
      domain.

   o  <initialDelegationDateTime> - an element containing the date and
      time of the initial delegation of this domain.
   o  <lastRenewalDateTime> - an element containing the date and time of
      last renewal of this domain.
   o  <expirationDateTime> - an element containing the date and time of
      the expiration of this domain.
   o  <lastContactModificationDateTime> - specifies the last time a
      contact for the domain was added or removed.
   o  <lastContactModificationBy> - an element containing an entity
      reference.  The referent MUST be a <contact> (Section 3.2.4)
      responsible for the last addition or removal of a contact for this
      domain.
   o  <lastDelegationModificationDateTime> - an element containing the
      date and time of the last time one of the nameservers was added or
      removed for the delegation of this domain.
   o  <lastDelegationModificationBy> - an element containing an entity

   <registrationAuthority
     authority="iana.org" registryType="dreg1"
     entityClass="registration-authority" entityName="iana" >
     <serviceInstance
       iris:referentType="iris:serviceIdentification"
       authority="iana.org" registryType="dreg1"
       entityClass="iris" entityName="id" />
     <organizationName>
       Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
     </organizationName>
     <registrar />
   </registrationAuthority>

   The <registrationAuthority> result represents an entity capable of
   registering domains.

   The <serviceInstance> child element of <registrationAuthority>
   contains an entity reference pointing to the entity "id" in the
   entity class "iris".  The authority areas found in the referent MUST
   be domains for which a given registration authority has control.

   The <organizationName> child element contains the name of the
   registration authority.

   The registration authority type child elements, <registry>,
   <registrar>, and <other>, determine the role in which this
   registration authority plays in the process of registering domains.
   The intent of this element is to explain the various roles a
   registration authority may have with regards to the authority areas
   pointed to by the <serviceInstance> element.  A client MAY understand
   the relationship of a registration authority with respect to a domain
   by the placement of the reference in the domain (e.g.  <registry> or
   <registrar>).

   The <domain> child elements each contain one domain name signifying
   the domains for which this registration authority may register
   sub-domains.

3.3  Generic Code Derivatives

3.3.1  <searchTooWide>

   Servers MAY use the <searchTooWide> error code when a query must be
   narrowed to yield a result set acceptable to the policies of the
   server operator.

3.3.2  <languageNotSupported>

   The queries <findDomainsByRegistrant>, <findDomainsByIDNName>, and
   <findContacts> support optional language tags that allow a client to
   suggest to a server the languages in which to scope the queries.  If
   a client passes to the server a language which the server does not
   support, the server MAY use this error code to indicate that one of
   the languages is not supported.

   This element contains child elements named <unsupportedLanguage>.
   Each of these child elements specify a language not supported by the
   server.  When a server returns this error, it MUST give the languages
   from the query which are not supported.

3.4  Support for <iris:lookupEntity>

   The following types of entity classes are recognized by the
   <lookupEntity> query of IRIS for this registry:
   o  host-name - the fully qualified domain name of a nameserver.
      Yields a <host> (Section 3.2.3) in the response.
   o  host-handle - the registry unique identifier given a nameserver.
      Yields a <host> (Section 3.2.3) in the response.
   o  domain-name - the fully qualified name of a domain.  This a domain
      name as specified by RFC 1035 [9].  Yields a <domain> (Section
      3.2.2) in the response.
   o  idn - the fully qualified name of a domain in nameprep form (see
      RFC 3491 [15]).  Yields a <domain> (Section 3.2.2) in the
      response.
   o  domain-handle - the registry unique identifier given a domain.
      Yields a <domain> (Section 3.2.2) in the response.
   o  contact-handle - the registry unique identifier given a contact.
      Yields a <contact> (Section 3.2.4) in the response.
   o  ipv4-address - the IPv4 address of a nameserver.  Yields a <host>
      (Section 3.2.3) in the response.
   o  ipv6-address - the IPv6 address of a nameserver.  Yields a <host>
      (Section 3.2.3) in the response.
   o  registration-authority - the name of a registration authority.
      Yields a <registrationAuthority> (Section 3.2.5) in the response.
   o  All names in these entity classes are case insensitive.

5.  BEEP Transport Compliance

   IRIS allows several extensions of the core capabilities.  This
   section outlines those extensions allowable by IRIS-BEEP [6].

5.1  Message Pattern

   This registry type uses the default message pattern as described in
   IRIS-BEEP [6].

5.2  Server Authentication

   This registry type only uses the basic TLS server authentication
   method as described in IRIS-BEEP [6].

6.  URI Resolution

6.1  Application Service Label

   The application service label associated with this registry type MUST
   be "DREG1".  This is the abbreviated form of the URN for this
   registry type, urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dreg1.

6.2  Bottom-Up Resolution

   The bottom-up alternative resolution method MUST be identified as
   'bottom' in IRIS URI's.

   The process for this resolution method differs from the
   direct-resolution method if the authority is only a domain name (i.e.
   without the port number).  The process for this condition is as
   follows:
   1.  The IRIS [5] direct resolution process is tried on the domain
       name (e.g.  "example.com" ).
   2.  If the direct resolution process yields no server for which a
       connection can be made, then the leftmost label of the domain
       name is removed, and the first step is repeated again (e.g.
       "com" ).
   3.  If all the labels of the domain name are removed and no server
       connections have been made, then the DNS is queried for the
       address records corresponding to the original domain name and the
       port used is the well-known port for the default protocol of
       IRIS.

6.3  Top-Down Resolution

   The top-down alternative resolution method MUST be identified as
   'top' in IRIS URI's.

   The process for this resolution method differs from the
   direct-resolution method if the authority is only a domain name (i.e.
   without the port number).  The process for this condition is as
   follows:
   1.  The domain name is reduced to its rightmost label.  This is
       always '.'.
   2.  The IRIS [5] direct resolution process is tried on the domain
       name.
   3.  If the direct resolution process yields no server for which a
       connection can be made, then the original label to the left of
       the rightmost label of the domain name is prepended, and the
       second step is repeated again (e.g.  if "." then "com", if "com"
       then "example.com").

   4.  If all the labels of the original domain are present and no
       server connections have been made, then the DNS is queried for
       the address records corresponding to the original domain name and
       the port used is the well-known port for the default protocol of
       IRIS.

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   Implementers should be aware of considerations for
   internationalization in IRIS [5].

   This document specifies the lookup of domain names, both the
   traditional ASCII form and the IDN form.  In addition, the social
   data associated with contacts may also be non-ASCII, and could
   contain virtually any Unicode character.  The <language> element is
   provided in queries that have potential to traverse such data.
   Clients should use these elements to indicate to the server of the
   target languages desired, and servers should use these elements to
   better enable normalization and search processes (see [18]).

   Clients needing to localize the data tags in this protocol should
   take note that localization is only needed on the names of XML
   elements and attributes with the exception of elements containing
   date and time information.  The schema for this registry has been
   designed so that clients need not interpret the content of elements
   or attributes for localization, other than those elements containing
   date and time information.

   Clients should also make use of the <language> elements provided in
   many of the results.  Results containing data that may be in Unicode
   are accompanied by these elements in order to aid better presentation
   of the data to the user.

   The "dateTimePrivacyType" element type contains the XML Schema [3]
   data type "dateTime".  The contents of this element MUST be specified
   using the 'Z' indicator for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1  XML Namespace URN Registration

   This document makes use of a proposed XML namespace and schema
   registry specified in XML_URN [16].  Accordingly, the following
   registration information is provided for the IANA:
   o  URN/URI:
      *  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dreg1
   o  Contact:
      *  Andrew Newton <andy@hxr.us>
      *  Marcos Sanz <sanz@denic.de>
   o  XML:
      *  The XML Schema specified in Section 4

8.2  S-NAPTR Registration

   The following S-NAPTR application service label will need to be
   registered with IANA according to the IANA considerations defined in
   IRIS [5]:
      DREG1

8.3  BEEP Registration

   The following BEEP Profile URI is to be registeried with IANA, in
   addition to the registration provided in IRIS-BEEP [6].

   This document lays out no new considerations for security precautions
   beyond that specified in IRIS [5].

Appendix B.  An Example Database Serialization

   The following is an example of serializing domain data.

   This example shows the serialization of a domain, a host, and a
   referral.

Appendix C.  Acknowledgements

   Many of the concepts concerning the use of SRV records for step-wise
   refinement towards finding authoritative servers and many of the
   details of result objects in this draft were originally created by
   Eric A.  Hall in his memos regarding the use of LDAP to satisfy the
   CRISP requirements.  These concepts have contributed significantly to
   the development of this protocol.

   David Blacka gave many technical contributions due to work on his
   IRIS implementation and experienced judgement.  He also contributed
   many editorial clarifications.
