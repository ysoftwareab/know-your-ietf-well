 Abstract
    
    Some implementations of IP Security (IPsec) may want to use a
    pseudo-random function derived from the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES).  This memo describes such an algorithm, called AES-CMAC-
    PRF-128.

 1. Introduction
 
    [AES-CMAC] describes a method to use the Advanced Encryption 
    Standard (AES) as a message authentication code (MAC) whose output
    is 128 bits long.  128 bits output is useful as a long-lived pseudo-
    random function (PRF) in either IKE version 1 or version 2.  This 
    document specifies PRF that support fixed and variable key sizes for
    IKEv2 [IKEv2] Key Derivation Function (KDF) and authentication.
 
 2. Basic definitions
 
   VK                Variable length key for AES-CMAC-PRF-128, Denoted
                     by VK.
 
   0^n               The string that consists of n zero-bits.
                     0^3 means that 000 in binary format.
                     10^4 means that 10000 in binary format.
                     10^i means that 1 followed by i-times repeated 
                     zero's.
 
   AES-CMAC          AES-CMAC algorithm with 128 bits long key described
                     in section 2.4 of [AES-CMAC].
 
 3. The AES-CMAC-PRF-128 Algorithm
 
    The AES-CMAC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical to AES-CMAC defined 
    in [AES-CMAC] except that the 128 bits key length restriction is
    removed.
 
    IKEv2 [IKEv2] uses PRFs for multiple purposes, most notably for
    generating keying material and authentication of the the IKE_SA. 
    The IKEv2 specification differentiates between PRFs with fixed key
    sizes and those with variable key sizes
 
    When using the PRF described in this document with IKEv2, the PRF is
    considered to be fixed-length for generating keying material but
    variable-length for authentication.

    In step 1, the key for AES-CMAC-PRF-128 is created as follows:
 
    o If the key is exactly 128 bits long, use it as-is.
 
    o If the key is longer or shorter than 128 bits long, then we derive
      new key K by performing AES-CMAC algorithm using 128 bits all
      zero key and VK as the message. This step is described in step 1b.
      
    In step 2, we perform AES-CMAC algorithm using K as the key and 
    M as the message. The output of this algorithm is returned.

 6.  Security Considerations
 
    The security provided by AES-CMAC-PRF-128 is based upon the strength
    of AES and AES-CMAC. At the time of this writing, there are no known
    practical cryptographic attacks against AES or AES-CMAC.
    However as is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its 
    strength lies in the secret key, 'K' and the correctness of the 
    implementation in all of the participating systems.
    Keys need to be chosen at random based on RFC 4086 [RFC4086]
    and should be kept in safe and periodically refreshed.
 
    Whenever keys larger than 128 bits are reduced to meet AES-128 key 
    input size, some entropy might be lost.  However, if using collision-
    resistant hash function such as AES-CMAC when generating new key for
    pseudo-random function, it preserves sufficient entropy as long as
    the pseudo-random function to be used requires 128 bits long input key.
 
 7. IANA Consideration
 
    IANA should allocate a value for IKEv2 Transform Type 2
    (Pseudo-Random Function) to the PRF_AES128_CMAC algorithm when this
    document is published.
