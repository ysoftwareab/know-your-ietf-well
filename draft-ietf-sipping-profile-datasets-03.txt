Abstract

   This document defines the requirements and a format for SIP user
   agent profile data.  An overall schema is specified for the
   definition of profile datasets.  The schema also provides for
   expressing constraints for how multiple sources of profile data are
   to be combined.  This document provides a guide to considerations,
   policies and syntax for defining datasets to be included in profile
   data.

1.  Introduction

   The SIP User Agent Profile Delivery Framework
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] and the Framework for SIP Session
   Policies [I-D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework] specify how SIP user
   agents locate and retrieve profile data specific to the user, the
   device, and the local network.  It is important for SIP User Agents
   to be able to obtain and use these multiple sources of profile data
   in order to support a wide range of applications without undue
   complexity.

   While these frameworks define the mechanisms for transmitting profile
   data, they do not define a format for the actual profile data.  This
   document defines the requirements, the default/mandatory to support
   content type for [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] , a high level
   schema for, and guide to how these datasets can be defined.  The goal
   is to enable any SIP user agent to obtain profile data and be
   functional in a new environment independent of the implementation or
   model of user agent.  The nature of having profile data from three
   potential sources requires the definition of policies on how to apply
   the data in an interoperable way across implementations which may
   have widely varying capabilities.

   The ultimate objective of the framework described here, together with
   the SIP User Agent Profile delivery framework, is to a start up
   experience requiring minimal user intervention.  One should be able
   to take a new SIP user agent out of the box, plug it in or install
   the software and have it get its profiles without human intervention
   other than security measures.  This is necessary for cost effective
   deployment of large numbers of user agents.


2.  Terminology

   "The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119."  [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terms "profile" and "device" as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework]:

   profile -  a set of configuration data intended to configure a
      specific device or devices and obtained from a specific source
      (e.g., user, device, local network or other).  Has a concrete
      representation as an XML document.

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   profile type -  a particular category of Profile data in regard to
      its source (e.g., user, device, local network or other).

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   profile schema -  a definition of a set of possible profiles that are
      seen as alternative configuration data for a set of UAs.  Has a
      specific XML namespace and a concrete representation in XML Schema
      Language and/or in Relax NG schema language.
   profile meta -  schema: the schema of the XML namespace
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:uaprof", from which are derived the
      various profile schemas
   user profile -  the profile that applies to a specific user.  The
      user profile is that set of profile data the user wants to
      associate with a given device (e.g. ringtones used when someone
      calls them, the user's shortcuts) and relate to the user's
      identity
   device profile -  data profile that applies to a specific device.
      This is the data that is bound to the device itself independent of
      the user that is bound to the device.  It relates to specific
      capabilities of the device and/or preferences of the owner of the
      device.
   local network profile -  data that applies to the user agent in the
      context of the local network.  This is best illustrated by roaming
      applications; a new device appears in the local network (or a
      device appears in a new network, depending on the point of view).
      The local network profile includes settings and perhaps policies
      that allow the user agent to function in the local network (e.g.
      how to traverse NAT or firewall, bandwidth constraints).
   merging -  the operation of resolving overlapping settings from
      multiple profiles.  Overlap occurs when the same property occurs
      in multiple profiles (e.g. device, user, local network).
   working profile -  the set of property values utilized in a SIP User
      Agent; logically constructed by merging the profiles from the
      relevant sources
   property -  a named configurable characteristic of a user agent; a
      named datum within a profile schema.  A given property has a well-
      defined range of possible values.  A given property may be defined
      to have a range of values, allow for simultaneous use of many
      values (as in a list of allowed possibilities), or a set of
      related values that collectively form a single profile information
      item.
   dataset -  a collection of properties.
   setting -  the binding of a specific value or set of values to a
      given property.

   Thus, a profile schema defines a dataset, and a profile is a set of
   settings that conforms to a particular profile schema.

3.  Overview

   In this document requirements are specified for containing and
   expressing profile data for use on SIP user agents.  Though much of
   this can be considered independent of SIP there is one primary
   requirement that is not well satisfied through more generic profile
   data mechanisms.  SIP User Agent set up requires the agent to merge
   settings, which may overlap, from potentially three different sources
   (see [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] ); each source must not only
   be able to provide profile information, but also express policies
   regarding how the profile settings may be combined with that from
   other sources.

   A schema and syntax is defined in this document to specify properties
   that may be aggregated to construct profiles.  The general design
   philosophy is that many small datasets provide flexibility to the
   implementer to support the aggregated set that best matches the
   capability of the user agent.  The actual properties are not defined
   in this document and will be the subject of derived drafts.  However,
   some examples are provided in Appendix B to illustrate the proposed
   mechanisms and to validate the requirements.

   This document defines a set of considerations, syntax and policies
   that must be specified when defining datasets.  These are to help
   authors of dataset specifications to define datasets that will work
   in the overall schema defined in this document.  The actual
   specification of these datasets is outside the scope of this
   document.


4.  Design Considerations

   The following section defines some of the design considerations that
   were taken into account when defining the schema, syntax and policies
   for generating and applying profile data.

4.1.  Requirement Descriptions

4.1.1.  Implementer Extensibility

   It does not serve user agent administrators to have to require a
   coordinated and orchestrated upgrade of every user agent and
   corresponding profile delivery servers for a new capability to be
   supported.  Datasets MUST be extensible without breaking the user
   agents that support that dataset.  This may require the user agents
   to ignore parts of the extended dataset that it does not support.  It
   may also be possible to tag the extensions with minimum version
   numbers to facilitate the user agents decision making.

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


4.1.2.  Flexible Capabilities

   Since user agents vary greatly in their capabilities, it MUST be
   possible for the implementer to tailor the datasets to the
   capabilities of the user agent device.  This implies that the profile
   is built up of a series of small datasets based upon the capabilities
   of the user agent.  The user agents MAY ignore datasets for
   capabilities they do not support.  This allows the profile delivery
   server to be agnostic of device capabilities.  It is however the
   implementer's choice to customize the delivered profile to the device
   capabilities.

4.1.3.  Access Control

   There are likely to be properties in various profile datasets that
   the Operators and Administrators do not want the users to sometimes
   not be able to modify or even see.  It MUST be possible to disallow
   the user from modifying a property.  It MUST be possible to obfuscate
   the user from seeing a property or its setting.  This access control
   information SHOULD be optional for a given property.This is supported
   by the admin value of the visibility attribute.

4.1.4.  Data Constraints and Range Definition

   Property values are likely to have an allowed set of values under
   most circumstances rather than completely unconstrained in their
   values.  It MUST be possible for the schema to specify constraints on
   a property value, viz, as a range or as a set of discrete values.
   These constraints SHOULD be optional to the dataset and SHOULD be
   expressible independent of the property itself.

4.1.5.  Support of User, Device, Local Network Sources

   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] specifies a mechanism where the
   user agent retrieves profile data from as many as three different
   sources.  The separation of the user profile facilitates a hotelling
   capability and the ability to easily re-assign a user to a different
   device.  The separation of the local network profile facilitates
   properties specific to operating in the local network in a roaming
   scenario (e.g. outbound proxy or NAT traversal properties).  The
   device profile facilitates device capability based properties as well
   as a means for the device owner or manager to impose policy.

   While increasing the complexity of the user agent in that it must
   aggregate and consolidate separate profiles into one working profile,
   constraining the properties of the various profiles to be mutually
   exclusive, or constraining even the merging rules would severely
   restrict functionality.



Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   Profile merging rules are associated with individual datasets or even
   associated with individual properties inside a dataset.  A profile
   MUST have a merging algorithm defined.  An individual property inside
   MAY contain a merging rule, in which case this merging rule is
   specific to the property.  If however, there is no merging rule
   associated with a property, but the profile dataset in its entirety
   has a merging rule, this merging rule MUST be applied to each of the
   properties that form part of the profile.

   A few of the more commonly used merging algorithms are defined in
   this document.  Most settings are likely to use the common set
   defined in this document.  However authors of profile datasets may
   define new algorithms for merging dataset properties (see
   Section 5.11 and Section 6.3 ).

4.1.6.  The Ability to Specify Policy

   Local Network Operators may wish to impose policy on users and
   devices on their network such as constraining codecs, media streams,
   outbound proxy or emergency services.  It MUST be possible to impose
   policy in any of the profile sources that constrains, overwrites or
   modifies properties provided in datasets from other sources.

4.1.7.  XML

   XML is perhaps not really a requirement, but a solution base upon
   requirements.  However it is hard to ignore the desire to utilize
   readily available tools to manage and manipulate profile data such as
   XSLT, XPATH and XCAP.  The requirement that should be considered when
   defining the schema and syntax is that many user agents have limited
   resources for supporting advanced XML operation.  The simplest XML
   construct possible should be used, that support the required
   functionality.  It is not a requirement that user agents validate the
   profile XML document.  This relieves the requirement that the Relax
   NG schema defined in this and other datasets documents be enforced on
   the user agent.  The Relax NG schema should not be used to strictly
   validate profile XML documents.  Unknown elements and attributes
   should be ignored to allow extensions to be supported.  Strict
   enforcement of the Relax NG schema would make it very difficult to
   deploy new user agents without lock step upgrades of the profile
   delivery server.  Guidelines for the Use of Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) within IETF Protocols [RFC3470] provides useful
   information in this regard.

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] SHOULD support the content-type:
   application/uaprofile+xml.  The Notifier SHOULD indicate all of the
   dataset schemas that is supports by listing all of the MIME types for
   the supported datasets in the SUBSCRIBE request header: Accept.  This
   document defines an Relax NG Schema for that content-type with the
   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:uaprof, for SIP Profile Datasets
   that provides:
   o  a base element type "setting" from which all settings in other
      schema definitions inherit (this allows other definitions to
      specify the content models for ways of combining settings; it is
      analogous to a C++ virtual base class).
   o  Attributes to the "setting" element that define constraints and
      other properties used to impose policy that apply to the element
      value.  These attributes are inherited by elements that are
      derived from the abstract settings element.
   o  A root element for all property sets (the outermost container).

   The full text of the schema is in Appendix A ; the following
   describes the usage of the schema in defining properties and
   combining them to construct the working profile of a User Agent.

5.1.  Data Primitives

   Each property in a profile data set is defined using XML Schema
   Datatypes [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2] and Relax NG Schema.  A property is
   modeled by an XML element derived from the "setting" element in the
   SIP Profile Data Set Schema.  The element content is the setting
   value.

   Properties consisting of one single value can be expressed using a
   single XML element.  Properties that may consist of multiple values
   require the use of container elements.  A container element is
   defined for such a property.  This container can contain multiple XML
   elements, which each defines a possible value for that property (see
   examples in Section 5.5.2 ).

   When constructing a property set, the creator of a profile may not be
   able to know all of the capabilities of the User Agent that will
   receive that property set.  The creator of profile constraints or
   policies should be aware that a user agent may ignore properties that
   are unsupported or do not apply to its capabilities.

5.2.  Use of Namespaces

   XML namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] provide a means to
   uniquely identify the elements and datatypes defined in a data set.
   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that each data set specifies its own
   namespace.  The namespace URIs SHOULD be URNs [RFC2141] , using the



Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [RFC2648] and extended by
   [RFC3688] .  The core schema defined in this document defines the
   namespace: "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:uaprof".  Profile datasets that
   extend this schema SHOULD define a new namespace by appending a ":"
   and a unique name to the "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:uaprof" namespace.
   These namespaces MUST be registered with IANA.

5.3.  The 'propertySet' Element

   The root element of a property set is "propertySet"; it is the
   container that is provided to the user agent.  The elements contained
   within a propertySet contain the specific properties which are to be
   applied to the user agent.  The properties may be simple types with a
   single value, complex types or container elements with a list of
   properties.

5.4.  The Abstract 'setting_container' Element

   The "setting_container" element is the abstract element in which a
   list of properties which allow multiple values may be contained.
   Elements derived from the "setting_container" element may contain
   zero or more elements derived from the "setting" element.  The
   "setting_container" element has an "excludedPolicy" attribute.

5.5.  The Abstract 'setting' Element

   The setting element is the abstract element from which all profile
   properties or settings shall inherit.

   The setting element has a number of attributes that provide
   functionalities, which are generally useful for many properties.
   These attributes are inherited by properties that are derived from
   the settings element.  This enables the re-use of common
   functionalities and ensures a common syntax for these elements across
   different data sets.  The following functionalities are provided by
   attributes of the settings element:

   o  Property Access Control: 'visibility' attribute
   o  Policies: 'policy' attribute

   Additional attributes are defined in the schema that may used in
   elements derived from "setting".  By default these attributes cannot
   be set.  These attribute must be explicitly added to elements derived
   from the "setting" element:

   o  Unidirectional Properties: 'direction' attribute

   o  Preferences: 'q' attribute

5.5.1.  The 'visibility' Attribute

   The attribute "visibility" is defined on the "setting" element to
   specify whether or not the user agent is permitted to display the
   property value to the user.  This is used to hide setting values that
   the profile administrator may not want the user to see or know.  The
   "visibility" attribute has two possible values:

   o  user: Specifies that display of the property value is not
      restricted to the user.  This is the default value of the
      attribute if it is not specified.
   o  admin: Specifies that the user agent SHOULD NOT display the
      property value.  Display of the property value may be allowed
      using special administrative interfaces, but is not appropriate to
      the ordinary user.

5.5.2.  The 'policy' Attributes

   The setting element has an optional 'policy' attribute.  The policy
   attribute is used to define the constraining properties of an
   element.  It defines how the element value is used by an endpoint
   (e.g. whether it can or can not be used in a session).  The following
   values are defined for the 'policy' attribute:

   o  allow: the value contained in the element is allowed and SHOULD be
      used in sessions.  This is the default value that is used if the
      'policy' attribute is omitted.
   o  disallow: the value contained in the element is forbidden and
      SHOULD NOT be used in sessions.

   The policy attribute can be omitted if the default policy 'allow'
   applies.

   The policy attribute is used only inside containers.

5.5.3.  The 'excludedPolicy' Attributes

   The "setting_container" element has an optional 'excludedPolicy'
   attribute.  This attribute specifies the default policy for all
   values that are not in the container.  Elements that are present in
   the container have their own 'policy' attribute, which defines the
   policy for that element.  The following values are defined for the
   'excludedPolicy' attribute:






Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   o  allow: values not listed in the container are allowed and MAY be
      used in sessions.  This is the default value that is used if the
      'excludedPolicy' attribute is omitted.
   o  disallow: values not listed in the container are forbidden and
      MUST NOT be used in sessions.

   The excludedPolicy attribute can be omitted if the default policy
   'allow' applies.  The following example shows a policy that allows
   the media type audio and disallows all other media types in sessions
   (effectively, this construct requires the use of audio):



   <media-types excludedPolicy="disallow">
     <media-type policy="allow">audio</media-type>
   </media-types>


5.5.4.  The 'direction' Attribute

   Some properties are unidirectional and only apply to messages or data
   streams transmitted into one direction.  For example, a property for
   media streams can be restricted to outgoing media streams only.
   Unidirectional properties can be expressed by adding a 'direction'
   attribute to the respective element.

   The 'direction' attribute can have the following values:

   o  recvonly: the property only applies to incoming messages/streams.
   o  sendonly: the property only applies to outgoing messages/streams.
   o  sendrecv: the property applies to messages/streams in both
      directions.  This is the default value that is used if the
      'direction' attribute is omitted.

5.5.5.  The 'q' Attribute

   It should be possible to express a preference for a certain value, if
   multiple values are allowed within a property.  For example, it
   should be possible to express that the codecs G.711 and G.729 are
   allowed, but G.711 is preferred.  Preferences can be expressed by
   adding a 'q' attribute to a property element.  Elements derived from
   the "setting" element for which multiple occurrences and values are
   allowed SHOULD have a "q" attribute if the order is significant.
   Typically these elements are contained in an element derived from the
   "setting_container" element.  The 'q' attribute is only meaningful if
   the 'policy' attribute set to 'allowed'.  It must be ignored in all
   other cases.

   An element with a higher 'q' value is preferred over one with a lower
   'q' value. 'q' attribute values range from 0 to 1.  The default value
   is 0.5.

5.6.  The 'profileUri' Element

   The <profileUri> element contains the URI of this profile on the
   profile server.  The value contained in the profileUri element may be
   different than the URI subscribe to when retrieving this profile.
   When the user agent retrieves a profile where the profileUri is
   different than the subscribe to URI, the user agent SHOULD
   unsubscribe to the current URI and then subscribe to the new URI.

   The <profileUri> element is optional and MAY occur only once inside a
   <propertySet> element.  The profileUri element is specific to the
   local-network, device or user profile in which it occurs.  It has no
   meaning outside of the profile in which it occurs and SHOULD NOT be
   merged.

5.7.  The 'profileCredential' Element

   The <profileCredential> element contains the digest authentication
   information that SHOULD be used for authentication for the profile
   subscription via SIP or profile retrieval via HTTP, HTTPS, etc.  The
   profileCredential element is optional and MAY occur only once inside
   a propertySet element.  The profileCredential element is specific to
   the local-network, device or user profile in which it occurs.  It has
   no meaning outside of the profile in which it occurs and SHOULD NOT
   be merged.  The profileCredential element MUST contain exactly one of
   each of the elements: realm, authUser and one of either a1Digest or
   password.

5.7.1.  realm Element

   The realm element contains the string that defines the realm to which
   this credential pertains.  The value of the realm element is the same
   as the realm parameter in the [RFC2617] headers: WWW-Authenticate,
   Authorization and the SIP [RFC3261] headers: Proxy-Authenticate and
   Proxy-Authorization.  If a match of the realm value is found, the
   user agent uses the values in the authUser and a1Digest elements
   contained in the profileCredential element.  Exactly one realm
   element MUST be contained in a profileCredential element.  A wildcard
   of "*" MAY be used as the realm value in which case the user agent
   MUST calculate the A1 DIGEST for the realm given in the
   authentication challenge.  If the wildcard is given for the realm,
   the clear text form of the password contained in the password element
   MUST also be used.

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


5.7.2.  authUser Element

   The authUser element contains the string value of the "username"
   parameter which SHOULD be used in Authorization and Proxy-
   Authorization request headers when retrying a request that was
   challenged for authentication.  Exactly one authUser element SHOULD
   be contained in a profileCredential element.

5.7.3.  a1Digest Element

   The a1Digest element contains a string with the value of the A1
   digest of the username, realm and password as defined in [RFC2617] .
   At most one a1Digest element MUST be contained in a profileCredential
   element.  The a1Digest element MUST NOT exist in a profileCredential
   element containing a password element.  The username and realm used
   to construct the value of the a1Digest element MUST match the values
   of the realm and authUser elements contained in the profileCredential
   element with the a1Digest element.

5.7.4.  password Element

   The password element contains the clear text password for use with
   DIGEST Authentication [RFC2617] .  At most one password MUST be
   contained in a profileCredential element.  The password element MUST
   NOT exist in a profileCredential element containing a a1Digest
   element.  The user agent uses this password along with the realm and
   authUser elements to calculate the A1 digest used for DIGEST
   Authentication.

5.8.  The 'profileContactUri' Element

   The <profileContactUri> element contains a contact URI (e.g. a SIP,
   HTTP URI or email address) under which the issuer of this profile can
   be reached.  The contact element may, for example, contain the
   address of a support hotline.

   The <profileContactUri> element is optional and MAY occur multiple
   times inside a <propertySet> element.  Multiple instances of the
   profileContactUri element allow multiple URI schemes to be provided
   for contact information.  The user agent MAY use the URI contained
   profile-contact-info element which has a URI scheme that the user
   agent supports and can make work to provide support help for the
   profile.  The user agent MAY provide the URIs to the user to contact
   the creator of the profile through other communication channels.  The
   profileContactUri element is specific to the local-network, device or
   user profile in which it occurs.  It has no meaning outside of the
   profile in which it occurs and SHOULD NOT be merged.

5.9.  The 'profileInfo' Element

   The <profileInfo> element provides a short textual description of the
   property that should be intelligible to the human user.  This element
   may, for example, contain information about the nature of this
   profile, such as "Access Network Profile".  The text in the
   <profileInfo> element is in particular be helpful when a user needs
   to decide whether or not to use a newly downloaded profile or when
   problems with a profile (e.g. a policy conflict) occur.  A user agent
   MAY display this information in these cases.

   The <profileInfo> element is optional and MAY occur only once inside
   a <propertySet> element.  The profileInfo element is specific to the
   local-network, device or user profile in which it occurs.  It has not
   meaning outside of the profile in which it occurs and SHOULD NOT be
   merged.

5.10.  Example Profile Dataset

   extension setting elements: ddd, foo, bar, boo, containerElement and
   setting container elements: myContainer, myContainer1, myContainer2
   and container3.

5.11.  Merging Property Sets

   A UA may receive property sets from multiple sources, which need to
   be merged into a single combined document the UA can work with.

   Properties that have a single value (e.g. the maximum bandwidth



Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   allowed) require that a common value is determined for this property
   during the merging process.  The merging rules for determining this
   value need to be defined individually for each element in the schema
   definition.  Properties that allow multiple values (i.e. property
   containers) need to be merged by combining the values from the
   different data sets.  The following sections describe recommended
   common merging algorithms.  A data set definition may refer to these
   algorithms.

5.11.1.  Single Numeric Value Merging Algorithm

   A general merging rule for elements with numeric values is to select
   the largest or the smallest value.  For example, a merging rule for a
   <max-bandwidth> element would be to select the smallest value from
   the values that are in the competing data sets.

5.11.2.  Multiple Enumerated Value Merging Algorithm

   Multiple values in property containers are merged by combining the
   values from each of the competing data sets.  This is accomplished by
   copying the elements from each property container into the merged
   container.  Elements with identical values are only copied once.  The
   'policy' attribute of two elements with the same value is adjusted
   during the merging process according to Table 1.  If an element
   exists only in one property container, then the default policy of the
   other container (i.e. the excludedPolicy) is used when accessing
   Table 1.  For example, if an element is disallowed in one data set
   and the element is not contained in the other data set but the
   default policy is allowed for that data set, then the values
   disallowed and allowed are used to access Table 1.  Consequently, the
   element will be disallowed in the merged data set.  Finally, the
   excludedPolicy attributes of the containers are also merged using
   Table 1.  In addition to these merging rules, each schema may define
   specific merging rules for each property container.



   set 1 \ set 2 |  allow   | disallow
   --------------+----------+----------
   allow         |  allow   | disallow
   disallow      | disallow | disallow

               Table 1: merging policies.


   The following example illustrates the merging process for two data
   sets.  All elements are merged into one container and the policy
   attributes are adjusted according to Table 1.  The merged container



Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   has the default policy disallow, which is determined using Table 1.
   The entry for PCMA in the merged data set is redundant since it has
   the default policy.



   Data set 1:
   <codecs excludedPolicy='allow'>
     <codec policy='disallow'>PCMA</codec>
   </codecs>

   Data set 2:
   <codecs excludedPolicy='disallow'>
     <codec policy='allow'>PCMA</codec>
     <codec policy='allow'>G729</codec>
   </codecs>

   Merged data set:
   <codecs excludedPolicy='disallow'>
     <codec policy='disallow'>PCMA</codec>
     <codec policy='allow'>G729</codec>
   </codecs>


   Some constellations of policy attributes result in an illegal merged
   data set.  They constitute a conflict that can not be resolved
   automatically.  For example, two data sets may define two non-
   overlapping sets of allowed audio codecs and both disallow all other
   codes.  The resulting merged set of codecs would be empty, which is
   illegal according to the schema definition of the codecs element.  If
   the use of these properties is enforced by both networks, the UA may
   experience difficulties or may not be able to set up a session at
   all.

   The combined property set MUST again be valid and well-formed
   according to the schema definitions.  A conflict occurs if the
   combined property set is not a well-formed document after the merging
   process is completed.

5.11.3.  Closest Value First Merging Algorithm

   Some properties require that the values from different data sets are
   ordered based on the origin of the data set during the merging
   process.  Property values that come from a domain close to the user
   agent take precedence over values that were in a data set delivered
   by a remote domain.  This order can be used, for example, to select
   the property value from the closest domain.  In many cases, this is
   the local domain of the user agent.  For example, the URI of an



Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   outbound proxy could be merged this way.  This order can also be used
   to generate an ordered list of property values during the merging
   process.  For example, multiple values for media intermediaries can
   be ordered so that the closest media intermediary is traversed before
   the second closest intermediary and so on.

   This merging algorithm requires that the source of a data set is
   considered.

   If property sets are delivered through the configuration framework
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] , the value received through a
   subscription using the "local-network" profile-type takes precedence
   over values received through other profile-type subscriptions,
   followed by device and then user profile-types.

   The session-specific policy mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework] provides an order among
   policy servers.  This order is based on the order, in which a SIP
   message traverses the network, starting with the closest domain.
   This order can directly be used to order property values as described
   above.

5.12.  Common Types

   The schema also defines a set of common types that are used in
   defining data sets (e.g.  DataIpPort).  [Need to document common
   types.]


6.  Defining Data Sets

   This section covers several issues that should be take into
   consideration when specifying new data set schemas.  This is intended
   to be a guide to authors writing specifications defining a new data
   set schema or extensions to existing ones.

6.1.  Namespace

   It is RECOMMENDED that a data set defines a new XML namespace
   [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] to scope all of the properties that are
   defined in the name space.

6.2.  Property Definitions

   The properties defined in a data set schema may be simple (i.e.
   having a single value) or they may be complex (i.e. a container with
   multiple values).  Each property in the data set SHOULD inherit from
   the "setting" element.  Complex properties and all of their child



Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


   elements each should inherit from "setting" as well.

   A data set specification should contain a section which defines the
   meaning of all of the properties contained in the data set.  The
   objective is to define the property such that implementers have a
   clear definition and semantics to interpret properties in a
   consistent way.  User agents not only need to use the same profile
   content, they need to apply the properties in a consistent way to
   achieve true interoperability.

   The following information should be defined for each property in a
   data set:
   o  description: describe the meaning and application of the property.
   o  cardinality: define how many instances of this property element
      may occur in a data set (e.g. zero, one or many) as well as its
      relationship to any other properties in this or other data sets.
   o  default value: define the default value of this property if it is
      not set.  Describe if the default is different if the property is
      present and not set vs. completely absent from the data set.
      Define if the default varies in relation to another property.

6.3.  Merging Data Sets

   User agents may receive data sets from multiple sources.  They need
   to merge these data sets in order to create an overall data set they
   can work with.  Collisions on data sets may occur if multiple sources
   provide different values for the same properties.  These collisions
   need to be resolved during the merging process.

   A data set schema MUST define rules for merging data sets from
   different sources for each property that is defined.  Recommendations
   for merging data sets are discussed in Section 5.11 .  A data set
   schema must define if and how these recommendations apply and MAY
   define alternative merging rules for specific settings.  A data set
   schema must also identify combinations of properties that constitute
   a conflict that can't resolved.  It may provide additional guidelines
   for the behavior of a user agent in these cases.


7.  Candidate Data Sets

   The following sections name some of the candidate data sets that are
   or may be defined.  These data sets can be aggregated to form
   profiles appropriate to the capabilities of a user agent
   implementation.

   o  SIP Protocol Data Set: the lowest common denominator set of
      properties common to all SIP user agents of any capability.  A
      schema covering the elements of this data set can be found in
      [I-D.petrie-sipping-sip-dataset] .
   o  Media Data Set: this data set contains media related policies.  A
      schema covering the elements of this data set can be found in
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-media-policy-dataset] .
   o  Identity Data Set: AORs and lines (see
      [I-D.petrie-sipping-identity-dataset] )
   o  HTTP Protocol Data Set: server settings.  Proxy for clients.
   o  NAT Traversal Data Set: settings for STUN, TURN etc.
   o  SIP Digit Maps Data Set:
      [I-D.petrie-sipping-voip-features-dataset]
   o  VoIP Features: [I-D.petrie-sipping-voip-features-dataset]


8.  Security Considerations

   Security is mostly a delivery problem.  The delivery framework SHOULD
   provide a secure means of delivering the profile data as it may
   contain sensitive data that would be undesirable if it were stolen or
   sniffed.  Storage of the profile on the profile delivery server and
   user agent is an implementation problem.  The profile delivery server
   and the user agent SHOULD provide protection that prevents
   unauthorized access of the profile data.  The profile delivery server
   and the user agent SHOULD enforce the access control policies defined
   in the profile data sets if present.
      The point of the access control construct on the data set is to
      provide some security policy on the visibility and ability to
      change sensitive properties.

   Some transport mechanisms for delivery of the profile data do not
   provide a secure means of delivery.  In addition some user agents may
   not have the resources to support the secure mechanism used for
   delivery (e.g.  TLS).


9.  IANA Considerations

      3023 [RFC3023], section 3.2.
   Security considerations:  This content type is designed to carry SIP
      user agent profile data, which may be considered private
      information.  Appropriate precautions should be adopted to limit
      disclosure of this information.
   Interoperability considerations:  This content type provides a common
      format for exchange of SIP user agent profile information.
   Published specification:  RFC XXXX (Note to RFC Editor: Please fill
      in XXXX with the RFC number of this specification)
   Applications which use this media type:  SIP user agents and profile
      delivery servers.
   Additional information:  Magic number(s): File extension(s):
      Macintosh File Type Code(s):
   Person & email address to contact for further information:  Sam
      Ganesan EMail: sam.ganesan@motorola.com com
   Intended usage:  LIMITED USE
   Author/Change controller:  This specification is a proposed work item
      of the IETF SIPPING working group, with mailing list address:
      sipping@ietf.org
   Other information:  This media type is a specialization of
      application/xml [RFC3023], and many of the considerations
      described there also apply to application/uaprof+xml.

Appendix B.  Use Cases

   In the following use case scenarios the device profile is provided by
   the device owner/manager.  The owner/manager may be a service
   provider, an enterprise or a user administering the device setup.
   The user is assumed to be the end user operating the user agent.  In
   the scenarios that the user profile is provided, the user profile
   contains user specific properties that the end user has set directly
   or indirectly through an administration process.  The local network
   profiles represent the suggested policy behavior that the local
   network operator would like user agents to adhere to
   [I-D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework] .  From a security
   perspective, the local network operator cannot trust the user agent
   to follow the local network profile policy.  The local network
   operator must use a means external to the user agent to enforce these
   policies.  The local network profile is intended to express to the
   user agent, the policies that the user agent should follow if the
   user agent wants to function properly in the local network.

   Two different use cases are developed and discussed below.  Similar
   use cases can be developed for individual datasets.  For example,
   analysis of Transport protocol settings for SIP can be carried out in
   exactly the same fashion as the codec use case described below and a
   set of derived requirements to drive the schema for the associated
   datset can be arrived at.

B.1.  Outbound Proxy Setting

   In the case of the outbound proxy, it is unlikely that the user would
   want to influence the outbound proxy for SIP signaling.  The device
   owner/manager or the local network operator are likely to want to set
   the outbound proxy property.  The device profile may define an
   outbound proxy so that the device owner/manager can monitor all
   signaling.  The local network operator also defines an outbound proxy
   because the proxy allows the SIP signaling to get through a NAT or
   firewall.

   Two possible solutions to this problem are listed.
   o  Define a policy where the local network profile overrides the
      device profile.  In this approach the local network profile wins.
   o  Aggregate the outbound proxies.  In this scenario SIP messages
      would be sent with a pre-populated route set that had two hops.
      First the outbound proxy set in the local network profile, then
      the outbound proxy set in the device profile.

   The aggregation approach is closest to solving the requirements to
   the use case above.  By aggregating the two outbound proxies, the
   local network provided outbound proxy allows the signaling to get out

   of the local network and the device profile provided outbound proxy
   is able to monitor all SIP signaling from the user agent.

B.2.  Codec Settings

   Use cases for the codec properties are likely one of the more
   complicated sets of properties with respect to merging and
   constraining across more than one profile.  There are reasonable
   scenarios where requirements can be rationalized that the device,
   user and local network profiles may each wish to express preferences
   and constraints on permitted codecs.  Without getting into details or
   syntax of the codec properties, it is assumed that codec properties
   will need to express a codec definition and a preference order.  This
   is the order that these codecs will be put in SDP for codec
   negotiation purposes.

   The following scenarios illustrate some possible combinations of
   sources of codec properties from the device, user and local network
   profiles.

B.2.1.  Codec Setting Not Set

   In the scenario where a device has no profiles or the profiles
   contain no codec properties, the device will enable a default set and
   preference order of codecs, which could be a subset of the codecs the
   device is capable of supporting.  The default set and preference
   order of codecs is a implemention specific.

B.2.2.  Codec Set in Device Profile

   This scenario assumes that the device profile is the only source of
   codec properties.

   The codecs in the device profile may differ from the set of codecs
   supported by the device, due to administrative constraints on codec
   usage.

   In this scenario the device profile data will dictate the ordered
   list of codecs to be applied.  The use agent will ignore codec types
   included in the profile that the user agent does not support.

B.2.3.  Set in Device and User Profiles

   This scenario covers the case where both the device profile and the
   user profile provide an ordered list of codecs.  The user may prefer
   a higher quality codec to be used, if available.  Thereby the user
   profile data may provide an ordered list of codecs to be applied.
   The device profile also specifies a list of codecs and a default

   preference order.

   The merging of the data sources is as follows:
   o  The ordering of the codecs will be determined from the user
      profile data, which overrides the codec preference ordering from
      the device profile data.
   o  The set of codecs that may be applied, are the codecs listed in
      the user data constrained by the list of codecs from the device
      profile data.

   The case in which none of the codecs in the resulting merged profile
   datasets are supported by the device, the profile data constitutes a
   misconfiguration between device and user profiles.  It may not be
   possible to successfully establish a session in this case.  It is
   suggested that the user agent provide feedback to the user indicating
   the misconfiguration.  The user agent may also attempt to function in
   the network by ignoring one or more of the profile constraints.

B.2.4.  Set in Device and Local Profiles

   In this scenario both the local network profile and the device
   profile each provide an ordered set of codecs.  Both the local
   network operator and the device provider may feel the need to
   constrain and order the set of codecs used.  This scenario is very
   much alike to the previous scenario and may be resolved using a
   similar method.  However, it likely that the local network codec
   preferences will override and constrain the device profile, given the
   caveat that in the circumstances where the resulting ordered set of
   codecs is an empty set.  In this case there is a misconfiguration/
   incompatibility between the device profile and the local network
   profile with regard to the codecs, which may render the device non
   functional.  The user agent may attempt to function in the network by
   ignoring one or more of the profile constraints.

B.2.5.  Set in Device, User and Local Profiles

   In this scenario all profiles namely, device, user and local network
   profiles, provide an ordered set of codecs as preferences.  For
   example, these may be the result of device capabilities, user's
   preference for higher quality media and the network providers desire
   to constrain bandwidth usage and or enforce uniformity of codec
   usage.  The data sources could be merged as follows:
   o  The ordering of the codecs will be determined from the user
      profile data, which overrides the ordering from the device profile
      data.
   o  The set of codecs that may be used are the codecs listed in the
      device profile data, constrained by the list of codecs from the
      user profile data and further constrained by the list of codecs



Dolly, et al.           Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 32]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Datasets                  March 2009


      from the local network profile data.

   A resulting null set of codecs would imply a misconfiguration and may
   prevent the device from functioning under these circumstances.  The
   user agent may also attempt to function in the network by ignoring
   one or more of the profile constraints.

B.2.6.  Example Derived Requirements

   An example set of derived requirements for the codec definition is
   presented here.  These requirements in turn would drive the profile
   definition for codec usage.
   1.  The list of codecs in the device profile data that get applied is
       the subset of the codecs supported by the device.  Codecs listed
       in profiles that are not supported by the device are ignored.
   2.  The device profile data will have a default ordered list of
       codecs, which implies a preference order to be used in the sdp
       offer.
   3.  The user profile data may provide an ordered list of user
       preferred codecs.  The ordering of the codecs in the user profile
       data will override the ordering of the codecs in the device
       profile data.  The user list of codecs may further constrain the
       list of codecs to be used.
   4.  The local network profile data may provide a list of codecs
       supported.  This list will further constrain the list of codecs
       that may be offered.
   5.  The application profile data containing codec data will be
       ignored.
   6.  The profiles need the ability to express codecs that may be used
       and codecs that should not be used.
