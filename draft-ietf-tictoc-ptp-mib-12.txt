Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using
   Precision Time Protocol (PTP), specified in IEEE Std. 1588(TM)-2008.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SMIv2, and semantically identical to the peer SMIv1
   definitions.

1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   module for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   Community. In particular, it describes managed objects used for
   managing PTP devices including the ordinary clock, transparent clock,
   boundary clocks.

   This MIB module is restricted to reading standard PTP data elements,
   as described in [IEEE 1588-2008].  This enables it to monitor the
   operation of PTP clocks within the network.  It is envisioned this
   MIB module will complement other managed objects to be defined that
   will provide more detailed information on the performance of PTP

   clocks supporting the Telecom Profile defined in [G.8265.1], and any
   future profiles that may be defined.  Those objects are considered
   out of scope for the current draft.

   Similarly, this MIB module is read-only and not intended to provide
   the ability to configure PTP clocks.  Since PTP clocks are often
   embedded in other network elements such as routers, switches and
   gateways, this ability is generally provided via the configuration
   interface for the network element.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

1.1. Relationship to other Profiles and MIBs

   This MIB module is intended to be used with the default PTP profile
   described in [IEEE 1588-2008] when running over the IP network layer.
   As stated above, it is envisioned this MIB module will complement
   other managed objects to be defined to monitor and measure the
   performance of PTP clocks supporting specific PTP profiles, e.g. the
   Telecom Profile defined in [G.8265.1].

   Some other PTP profiles have their own MIB modules defined as part of
   the profile, and this MIB module is not intended to replace those MIB
   modules.

1.2. Change Log

   This section tracks changes made to the revisions of the Internet
   Drafts of this document.  It will be *deleted* when the document is
   published as an RFC.

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o An overall architecture, described in STD62, [RFC 3411].

   o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
      STD 16: [RFC 1155], [RFC 1212] and [RFC 1215].
      The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58:
      [RFC 2578], [RFC 2579] and [RFC 2580].

   o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15 [RFC 1157].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in [RFC 1901] and
      [RFC 1906].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in STD62: [RFC 3417], [RFC 3412] and [RFC
      3414].

   o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15 [RFC 1157].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 62
      [RFC 3416].

   o A set of fundamental applications described in STD 62 [RFC 3413]

      and the view-based access control mechanism described in STD 62
      [RFC 3415].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB module conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the
   appropriate translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be
   semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted
   because no translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some
   machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB module.

3. Overview

   The objects defined in this MIB module are to be used when describing
   the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), as defined in [IEEE 1588-2008].

   Section 6 of [IEEE 1588-2008] provides an overview of synchronization
   networks using PTP.

   Terms used in this document have meanings as defined in section 3.1
   of [IEEE 1588-2008].

    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module for PTP version 2 (IEEE Std. 1588(TM)-2008)

        Overview of PTP version 2 (IEEE Std. 1588(TM)-2008)

        [IEEE 1588-2008] defines a protocol enabling precise
        synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems
        implemented with packet-based networks, the Precision Time
        Protocol Version 2 (PTPv2).  This MIB module does not address
        the earlier version IEEE Std. 1588(TM)-2002 (PTPv1).  The
        protocol is applicable to network elements communicating using
        IP.  The protocol enables heterogeneous systems that include
        clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability
        to synchronize to a grandmaster clock.

        The protocol supports system-wide synchronization accuracy in
        the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local clock
        computing resources. [IEEE 1588-2008] uses UDP/IP or
        Ethernet and can be adapted to other mappings. It includes
        formal mechanisms for message extensions, higher sampling rates,
        correction for asymmetry, a clock type to reduce error

        accumulation in large topologies, and specifications on how to
        incorporate the resulting additional data into the
        synchronization protocol. The [IEEE 1588-2008] defines
        conformance and management capability also.

        MIB description

        This MIB module supports the Precision Time Protocol version 2
        (PTPv2, hereafter designated as PTP) features of network element
        system devices, when using the default PTP profile described in
        [IEEE 1588-2008] when running over the IP network layer.

        It is envisioned this MIB module will complement other managed
        objects to be defined to monitor and measure the performance of
        the PTP devices and telecom clocks supporting specific PTP
        profiles.

        Some other PTP profiles have their own MIB modules defined as
        part of the profile, and this MIB module is not intended to
        replace those MIB modules.

        Technical terms used in this module are defined in [IEEE 1588-
2008].

        The MIB module refers to the sections of [IEEE 1588-2008].

5. Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   The following objects all have a MAX-ACCESS of read-only:

     ptpDomainClockPortsTotal,
     ptpbaseSystemDomainTotals,
     ptpbaseSystemProfile expose general information about the clock
     system.

     ptpbaseClockRunningState,
     ptpbaseClockRunningPacketsSent,
     ptpbaseClockRunningPacketsReceived expose a clock's current running
     status.

     ptpbaseClockTimePropertiesDSFreqTraceable,
     ptpbaseClockTimePropertiesDSPTPTimescale,
     ptpbaseClockTimePropertiesDSSource expose the values of a clock's
     time properties dataset (timePropertiesDS).

     ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSClockIdentity,
     ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSNumOfPorts,
     ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSDelay,
     ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSPrimaryDomain expose the values of a

     ptpbaseClockPortDSPortIdentity,
     ptpbaseClockPortDSlogAnnouncementInterval,
     ptpbaseClockPortDSAnnounceRctTimeout,

     ptpbaseClockPortDSPeerMeanPathDelay,
     ptpbaseClockPortDSGrantDuration,
     ptpbaseClockPortDSPTPVersion expose the values of a clock port's
     port dataset (portDS).

     ptpbaseClockPortTransDSPortIdentity,
     ptpbaseClockPortTransDSlogMinPdelayReqInt,
     ptpbaseClockPortTransDSFaultyFlag,
     ptpbaseClockPortTransDSPeerMeanPathDelay expose the values of a

     ptpbaseClockPortAssociatePacketsSent,
     ptpbaseClockPortAssociatePacketsReceived,
     ptpbaseClockPortAssociateInErrors,
     ptpbaseClockPortAssociateOutErrors expose information about a clock
     port's peer node.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC 3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC 3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC 3826]. Implementations

   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC 5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC 5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC 6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   recommended.  Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access them.

6. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module defined in this document uses the following IANA-
   assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers
   registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           ptpbaseMIB        { mib-2 xxx }

   [NOTE for IANA: Please allocate an object identifier at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers for object ptpbaseMIB.]
