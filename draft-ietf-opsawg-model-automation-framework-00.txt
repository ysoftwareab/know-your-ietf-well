  A Framework for Automating Service and Network Management with YANG
            draft-ietf-opsawg-model-automation-framework-00

Abstract

   Data models for service and network management provides a
   programmatic approach for representing (virtual) services or networks
   and deriving (1) configuration information that will be communicated
   to network and service components that are used to build and deliver
   the service and (2) state information that will be monitored and
   tracked.  Indeed, data models can be used during various phases of
   the service and network management life cycle, such as service
   instantiation, service provisioning, optimization, monitoring, and
   diagnostic.  Also, data models are instrumental in the automation of
   network management.  They also provide closed-loop control for the
   sake of adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and
   maintenance.

   This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an
   architecture for service and network management automation that takes
   advantage of YANG modeling technologies.  This framework is drawn
   from a network provider perspective irrespective of the origin of a
   data module; it can accommodate even modules that are developed
   outside the IETF.

   The document aims to exemplify an approach that specifies the journey
   from technology-agnostic services to technology-specific actions.

1.  Introduction

   The service management system usually comprises service activation/
   provision and service operation.  Current service delivery
   procedures, from the processing of customer's requirements and order
   to service delivery and operation, typically assume the manipulation
   of data sequentially into multiple OSS/BSS applications that may be
   managed by different departments within the service provider's
   organization (e.g., billing factory, design factory, network
   operation center, etc.).  In addition, many of these applications
   have been developed in-house over the years and operating in a silo
   mode:

   o  The lack of standard data input/output (i.e., data model) also
      raises many challenges in system integration and often results in
      manual configuration tasks.

   o  Secondly, many current service fulfillment system might have limit
      visibility to the network and therefore have slow response to the
      network changes.

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) becomes crucial to address these
   challenges.  SDN techniques [RFC7149] are meant to automate the
   overall service delivery procedures and typically rely upon
   (standard) data models that are used to not only reflect service
   providers'savoir-faire but also to dynamically instantiate and
   enforce a set of (service-inferred) policies that best accommodate
   what has been (contractually) defined (and possibly negotiated) with
   the customer.  [RFC7149] provides a first tentative to rationalize
   that service provider's view on the SDN space by identifying concrete
   technical domains that need to be considered and for which solutions
   can be provided:



Wu, et al.                Expires May 20, 2020                  [Page 3]

   o  Techniques for the dynamic discovery of topology, devices, and
      capabilities, along with relevant information and data models that
      are meant to precisely document such topology, devices, and their
      capabilities.

   o  Techniques for exposing network services [RFC8309] and their
      characteristics.

   o  Techniques used by service-requirement-derived dynamic resource
      allocation and policy enforcement schemes, so that networks can be
      programmed accordingly.

   o  Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
      efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
      service fulfillment and assurance perspective.

   Models are key for each of these technical items.  Service and
   network management automation is an important step to improve the
   agility of network operations and infrastructures.  Models are also
   important to ease integrating multi-vendor solutions.

   YANG module developers have taken both top-down and bottom-up
   approaches to develop modules [RFC8199], and also to establish a
   mapping between network technology and customer requirements on the
   top or abstracting common construct from various network technologies
   on the bottom.  At the time of writing this document (2019), there
   are many data models including configuration and service models that
   have been specified or are being specified by the IETF.  They cover
   many of the networking protocols and techniques.  However, how these
   models work together to configure a device, manage a set of devices
   involved in a service, or even provide a service is something that is
   not currently documented either within the IETF or other SDOs (e.g.,
   MEF).

   This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an
   architecture for service and network management automation that takes
   advantage of YANG modeling technologies and investigates how
   different layer YANG data models interact with each other (e.g.,
   service mapping, model composing) in the context of service delivery
   and fulfillment.

   This framework is drawn from a network provider perspective
   irrespective of the origin of a data module; it can accommodate even
   modules that are developed outside the IETF.

   The document also identifies a list of use cases to exemplify the
   proposed approach, but it does not claim to be exhaustive.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8309][RFC8199] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  Network Operator

   o  Customer

   o  Service

   o  Data Model

   o  Service Model

   o  Network Element Module

   The document makes use of the following terms:

   Network Model:  The Network Model describes network level abstraction
      or various aspects of a network infrastructure, including devices
      and their subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the link
      and network layers across multiple devices.  It can be used by a
      network operator to allocate the resource(e.g., tunnel resource,
      topology resource) for the service or schedule the resource to
      meet the service requirements define in the Service Model.

   Device Model:  Network Element YANG data module described in
      [RFC8199].

3.  Architectural Concepts & Goals

3.1.  Data Models: Layering and Representation

   As described in [RFC8199], layering of modules allows for better
   reusability of lower-layer modules by higher-level modules while
   limiting duplication of features across layers.

   The data modules developed by IETF can be classified into service
   level, network level and device level modules.  Different service
   module at service level may rely on the same set of network level or
   device level modules.

   Service level modules usually follow top down approach and are mostly
   customer-facing modules providing a common model construct for higher
   level network services (e.g., L3VPN), which can be further mapped to
   network technology-specific modules at lower layer (e.g., tunnel,
   routing, QoS, security).  For example, the service level can be used

   to characterise the network service(s) to be ensured between service
   nodes (ingress/egress) such as the communication scope (pipe, hose,
   funnel, ...), the directionality, the traffic performance guarantees
   (one-way delay (OWD), one-way loss, ...), etc.

   Network level modules are mainly network resource-facing modules and
   describe various aspects of a network infrastructure, including
   devices and their subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the
   link and network layers across multiple devices (e.g., Network
   topology and traffic- engineering Tunnel modules).

   Device (and function) level modules usually follow a bottom-up
   approach and are mostly technology-specific modules used to realize a
   service (e.g., BGP, NAT).

   Each level maintains a view of the supported YANG modules provided by
   low-levels (see for example, Appendix A).

   Figure 1 illustrates the overall layering model.

                        Layering and representation

3.2.  Automation of Service Delivery Procedures

   To dynamically offer and deliver service offerings, Service level
   modules can be used by an operator.  One or more monolithic Service
   modules can be used in the context of a composite service activation
   request (e.g., delivery of a caching infrastructure over a VPN).
   Such modules are used to feed a decision-making intelligence to
   adequately accommodate customer's needs.





Wu, et al.                Expires May 20, 2020                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation  November 2019


   Also, such modules may be used jointly with services that require
   dynamic invocation.  An example is provided by the service modules
   defined by the DOTS WG to dynamically trigger requests to handle DDoS
   attacks [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel][I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel].

   Network level modules can be derived from service level modules and
   used to provision, monitor, instantiate the service, and provide
   lifecycle management of network resources (e.g., expose network
   resources to customers or operators to provide service fulfillment
   and assurance and allow customers or operators to dynamically adjust
   the network resources based on service requirements as described in
   service level modules and the current network performance information
   described in the telemetry modules).

3.3.  Service Fullfillment Automation

   To operate the service, Device level modules derived from Service
   level modules or Network level modules can be used to provision each
   involved network function/device with the proper configuration
   information, and operate the network based on service requirements as
   described in the Service level module(s).

   In addition, the operational state including configuration that is in
   effect together with statistics should be exposed to upper layers to
   provide better network visibility (and assess to what extent the
   derived low level modules are consistent with the upper level
   inputs).

   Note that it is important to correlate telemetry data with
   configuration data to be used for closed loops at the different
   stages of service delivery, from resource allocation to service
   operation, in particular.

3.4.  YANG Modules Integration

   To support top-down service delivery, YANG modules at different level
   or at the same level need to be integrated together to enable
   function, feature in the network device and get network setup.  For
   example, the service parameters captured in service level modules
   need to be decomposed into a set of (configuration/notification)
   parameters that may be specific to one or more technologies; these
   technology-specific parameters are grouped together to define
   technology-specific device level models or network level models.

   In addition, these technology-specific device level models or network
   level models can be further integrated with each other using schema
   mount mechanism [RFC8528] to provision each involved network
   function/device or each involved administrative domain to support

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation  November 2019


   newly added module or features.  A collection of device models
   integrated together can be loaded and validated during implementation
   time.

   Policies provide a higher layer of abstraction.  Policy models can be
   defined at service level, network level, or device level to provide
   policy-based management and telemetry automation,e.g., telemetry data
   can trigger a new policy that captures new network service
   requirements.

   Performance measurement telemetry can be used to provide service
   assurance at service level or at the network level.  Performance
   measurement telemetry model can tie with network level model or
   service level model to monitor network performance or service level
   agreement.

4.1.  Service Lifecycle Management Procedure

   Service lifecycle management includes end to end service lifecycle
   management at the service level and specific network lifecycle
   management at the network level.  The end-to-end service lifecycle
   management is multi-domain or multi-layer service management while
   specific service lifecycle management is domain specific or layer
   specific service lifecycle management.

   o  Note: Clarify what is meant by "domain".

4.1.1.  Service Exposure

   A service in the context of this document (sometimes called a Network
   Service) is some form of connectivity between customer sites and the
   Internet or between customer sites across the network operator's
   network and across the Internet.

   Service exposure is used to capture services offered to customers
   (ordering and order handling).  One typical example is that a
   customer can use a L3SM service model to request L3VPN service by
   providing the abstract technical characterization of the intended
   service between cutsomer sites.

   Service model catalogs can be created along to expose the various
   services and the information needed to invoke/order a given service.

4.1.2.  Service Creation/Modification

   A customer is (usually) unaware of the technology that the network
   operator has available to deliver the service, so the customer does
   not make requests specific to the underlying technology but is
   limited to making requests specific to the service that is to be
   delivered.  This service request can be issued using the service
   model.

   The service orchestrator/management system maps such service request
   to its view.  This view can be described as a network model and this
   mapping may include a choice of which networks and technologies to
   use depending on which service features have been requested.

   In addition, a customer may require to change underlying network
   infrastructure to adapt to new customer's needs and service
   requirements.  This service modification can be issued in the same
   service model used by the service request.

4.1.3.  Service Optimization

   Service optimization is a technique that gets the configuration of
   the network updated due to network change, incident mitigation, or
   new service requirements.  One typical example is once the tunnel or
   the VPN is setup, Performance monitoring information or telemetry
   information per tunnel or per VPN can be collected and fed into the
   management system, if the network performance doesn't meet the
   service requirements, the management system can create new VPN
   policies capturing network service requirements and populate them
   into the network.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation  November 2019


   Both network performance information and policies can be modelled
   using YANG.  With Policy-based management, self-configuration and
   self-optimization behavior can be specified and implemented.

4.1.4.  Service Diagnosis

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions for service diagnosis that allow operators to:

   o  monitor network communications (i.e., reachability verification
      and Continuity Check)

   o  troubleshoot failures (i.e., fault verification and localization)

   o  monitor service-level agreements and performance (i.e.,
      performance management)

   When the network is down, service diagnosis should be in place to
   pinpoint the problem and provide recommendation (or instructions) for
   the network recovery.

   The service diagnosis information can be modelled as technology-
   independent RPC operations for OAM protocols and technology-
   independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for OAM protocols
   [RFC8531][RFC8533].  These models can provide consistent
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms
   used to manage the network.

4.1.5.  Service Decommission

   Service decommission allow the customer to stop the service and
   remove the service from active status and release the network
   resource that is allocated to the service.  Customer can also use the
   service model to withdraw the subscription to a service.

4.2.  Service Fullfillment Management Procedure

4.2.1.  Intended Configuration Provision

   Intended configuration at the device level is derived from network
   model at the network level or service model at the service level and
   represents the configuration that the system attempts to apply.  Take
   L3SM service model as an example, to deliver a L3VPN service, we need
   to map L3VPN service view defined in Service model into detailed
   intended configuration view defined by specific configuration models
   for network elements, configuration information includes:

   o  VRF definition, including VPN Policy expression



Wu, et al.                Expires May 20, 2020                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation  November 2019


   o  Physical Interface

   o  IP layer (IPv4, IPv6)

   o  QoS features such as classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Routing protocols: support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in the document, as well as routing policies associated
      with those protocols.

   o  Multicast Support

   o  NAT or address sharing

   o  Security function

   This specific configuration models can be used to configure PE and CE
   devices within the site, e.g., A BGP policy model can be used to
   establish VPN membership between sites and VPN Service Topology.

4.2.2.  Configuration Validation

   Configuration validation is used to validate intended configuration
   and ensure the configuration take effect.  For example, a customer
   creates an interface "et-0/0/0" but the interface does not physically
   exist at this point, then configuration data appears in the
   <intended> status but does not appear in <operational> datastore.

4.2.3.  Performance Monitoring

   When configuration is in effect in the device, <operational>
   datastore holds the complete operational state of the device
   including learned, system, default configuraton and system state.
   However the configurations and state of a particular device does not
   have the visibility to the whole network or information of the flow
   packets are going to take through the entire network.  Therefore it
   becomes more difficult to operate the network without understanding
   the current status of the network.

   The management system should subscribe to updates of a YANG datastore
   in all the network devices for performance monitoring purpose and
   build full topological visibility to the network by aggregating and
   filtering these operational state from different sources.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation  November 2019


4.2.4.  Fault Diagnostic

   When configuration is in effect in the device, some device may be
   misconfigured(e.g.,device links are not consistent on both sides of
   the network connection), network resources be misallocated and
   services may be negatively affected without knowing what is going on
   in the network.

   Technology-dependent nodes and remote procedure call (RPC) commands
   are defined in technology-specific YANG data models which can use and
   extend the base model described in Section 4.1.4can be used to deal
   with these challenges.

   These RPC command recieved in the technology dependent node can be
   used to trigger technology specific OAM message exchange for fault
   verification and fault isolation,e.g., TRILL Multicast Tree
   Verification (MTV) RPC command [I-D.ietf-trill-yang-oam] can be used
   to trigger Multi-Destination Tree Verification Message defined in
   [RFC7455] to verify TRILL distribution tree integrity.

4.3.  Multi-layer/Multi-domain Service Mapping

   Multi-layer/Multi-domain Service Mapping allow you map end to end
   abstract view of the service segmented at different layer or
   different administrative domain into domain specific view.  One
   example is to map service parameters in L3VPN service model into
   configuration parameters such as RD, RT, and VRF in L3VPN network
   model.  Another example is to map service parameters in L3VPN service
   model into TE tunnel parameter (e.g.,Tunnel ID) in TE model and VN
   parameters (e.g., AP list, VN member) in TEAS VN model [I-D.ietf-
   teas-actn-vn-yang].

4.4.  Service Decomposing

   Service Decomposing allows to decompose service model at the service
   level or network model at the network level into a set of device/
   function models at the device level.  These device models may be tied
   to specific device type or classified into a collection of related
   YANG modules based on service type and feature offered and load at
   the implementation time before configuration is loaded and validated.

                 Figure 2: L3VPN Service Delivery Example

   In reference to Figure 2, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the L3VPN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in this document:

   1.  Customer Requests to create two sites based on L3SM Service model
       with each having one network access connectivity:

          Site A: Network-Access A, Bandwidth=20M, for class "foo",
          guaranteed-bw-percent = 10, One-Way-Delay=70 msec

          Site B: Network-Access B, Bandwidth=30M, for class "foo1",
          guaranteed-bw-percent = 15, One-Way-Delay=60 msec

   2.  The Orchestrator extracts the service parameters from the L3SM
       model.  Then, it uses them as input to translate them into an
       orchestrated configuration of network elements (e.g., RD, RT,
       VRF, etc.) that is part of the L3NM network model.

   3.  The Controller takes orchestrated configuration parameters in the
       L3NM network model and translates them into orchestrated
       configuration of network elements that is part of BGP model, QoS
       model, Network Instance model, IP management model, interface
       model, etc.

                                 Figure 3

   In reference to Figure 3, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the VN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in this document:

   1.  Customer requests to create 'VN' based on Access point,
       association between VN and Access point, VN member defined in the
       VN YANG module.

   2.  The orchestrator creates the single abstract node topology based
       on the information captured in an VN YANG module.

   3.  The Customer exchanges connectivity-matrix on abstract node and
       explicit path using TE topology model with the orchestrator.
       This information can be used to instantiate VN and setup tunnels
       between source and destination endpoints.

   4.  The telemetry which augments the TEAS VN model and corresponding
       TE Tunnel model can be used to notify all the parameter changes
       and network performance change related to VN topology or Tunnel
       [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics].  This information
       can be further used as input to ECA engine in the orchestrator
       and generate ECA policy model to optimize the network.

Appendix A.  Layered YANG Modules Example Overview

   It is not the intent of this document to provide an inventory of
   tools and mechanisms used in specific network and service management
   domains; such inventory can be found in documents such as [RFC7276].

A.1.  Service Models: Definition and Samples

   As described in [RFC8309], the service is "some form of connectivity
   between customer sites and the Internet and/or between customer sites
   across the network operator's network and across the Internet".  More
   concretely, an IP connectivity service can be defined as the IP
   transfer capability characterized by a (Source Nets, Destination
   Nets, Guarantees, Scope) tuple where "Source Nets" is a group of

   unicast IP addresses, "Destination Nets" is a group of IP unicast
   and/or multicast addresses, and "Guarantees" reflects the guarantees
   (expressed in terms of Quality Of Service (QoS), performance, and
   availability, for example) to properly forward traffic to the said
   "Destination" [RFC7297].

   For example:

   o  L3SM model [RFC8299] defines the L3VPN service ordered by a
      customer from a network operator.

   o  L2SM model [RFC8466] defines the L2VPN service ordered by a
      customer from a network operator.

   o  VN model [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang]provides a YANG data model
      generally applicable to any mode of Virtual Network (VN)
      operation.

A.2.  Network Models: Definitions and Samples

   Figure 4 depicts a set of Network models such as topology models or
   tunnel models:

   o  Network Topology Models: [RFC8345] defines a base model for
      network topology and inventories.  Network topology data include
      link resource, node resource, and terminate-point resources.

   o  TE Topology Models: [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] defines a data
      model for representing and manipulating TE topologies.

      This module is extended from network topology model defined in
      [RFC8345] with TE topologies specifics.  This model contains
      technology-agnostic TE Topology building blocks that can be
      augmented and used by other technology-specific TE Topology
      models.

   o  L3 Topology Models

      [RFC8346] defines a data model for representing and manipulating
      L3 Topologies.  This model is extended from the network topology
      model defined in [RFC8345] with L3 topologies specifics.

   o  L2 Topology Models

      [I.D-ietf-i2rs-yang-l2-topology] defines a data model for
      representing and manipulating L2 Topologies.  This model is
      extended from the network topology model defined in [RFC8345] with
      L2 topologies specifics.

   Tunnel YANG module Examples:

   o  Tunnel identities [I-D.ietf-softwire-iftunnel] to ease
      manipulating extensions to specific tunnels.

   o  TE Tunnel Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] defines a YANG module for the
      configuration and management of TE interfaces, tunnels and LSPs.

   o  SR TE Tunnel Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for Segment Routing (SR) TE
      specific data.

   o  MPLS TE Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for MPLS TE configurations,
      state, RPC and notifications.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation  November 2019


   o  RSVP-TE MPLS Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-rsvp-te] augments the RSVP-TE generic module
      with parameters to configure and manage signaling of MPLS RSVP-TE
      LSPs.

   Other Network Models:

   o  Path Computation API Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-path-computation] YANG module for a stateless RPC
      which complements the stateful solution defined in [I.D-ietf-teas-
      yang-te].

   o  OAM Models (including Fault Management (FM) and Performance
      Monitoring)

      [RFC8532] defines a base YANG module for the management of OAM
      protocols that use Connectionless Communications.  [RFC8533]
      defines a retrieval method YANG module for connectionless OAM
      protocols.  [RFC8531] defines a base YANG module for connection
      oriented OAM protocols.  These three models are intended to
      provide consistent reporting, configuration and representation for
      connection-less OAM and Connection oriented OAM separately.

      Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
      Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the
      network services or necessarily point to the root cause.  [I.D-
      ietf-ccamp-alarm-module] defines a YANG module for alarm
      management.

   o  Generic Policy Model

      The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based
      management framework [RFC8328] defines base YANG modules
      [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-data-model]to encode policy.  These
      models point to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG
      modules developed elsewhere.  Policy rules within an operator's
      environment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-
      wide, policies to a network management function (within a
      controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).  The network
      management function can then control the configuration and/or
      monitoring of network elements and services.  This document
      describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements, and interfaces.

A.3.  Device Models: Definitions and Samples

   Network Element models (Figure 5) are used to describe how a service
   can be implemented by activating and tweaking a set of functions
   (enabled in one or multiple devices, or hosted in cloud
   infrastructures) that are involved in the service delivery.  The
   following figure uses IETF defined models as an example.

A.3.1.  Model Composition

   o  Device Model

      [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-device-model] presents an approach for organizing
      YANG modules in a comprehensive logical structure that may be used
      to configure and operate network devices.  The structure is itself
      represented as an example YANG module, with all of the related
      component models logically organized in a way that is
      operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be
      implemented.

   o  Logical Network Element Model

      [RFC8530] defines a logical network element module which can be
      used to manage the logical resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for logical resource partitioning are Logical Systems or Logical
      Routers.

   o  Network Instance Model

      [RFC8529] defines a network instance module.  This module can be
      used to manage the virtual resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for virtual resource partitioning are Virtual Routing and
      Forwarding (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs).

A.3.1.1.  Schema Mount

   Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design principles
   of the YANG data modeling language.  As a result, the same YANG
   module can be combined with various sets of other modules and thus
   form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
   specific use case.  [RFC8528] defines a mechanism, denoted schema
   mount, that allows for mounting one data model consisting of any
   number of YANG modules at a specified location of another (parent)
   schema.

   That capability does not cover design time.

A.3.2.  Device Models: Definitions and Samples

   BGP:       [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-yang-model] defines a YANG module for
              configuring and managing BGP, including protocol, policy,
              and operational aspects based on data center, carrier and
              content provider operational requirements.

   MPLS:      [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang] defines a base model for MPLS
              which serves as a base framework for configuring and
              managing an MPLS switching subsystem.  It is expected that
              other MPLS technology YANG modules (e.g.  MPLS LSP Static,
              LDP or RSVP-TE models) will augment the MPLS base YANG
              module.

   QoS:       [I-D.asechoud-netmod-diffserv-model] describes a YANG
              module of Differentiated Services for configuration and
              operations.

   ACL:       Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements
              used to configure device forwarding behavior.  It is used
              in many networking technologies such as Policy Based
              Routing, Firewalls, etc.  [RFC8519] describes a data model
              of Access Control List (ACL) basic building blocks.

   NAT:       For the sake of network automation and the need for
              programming Network Address Translation (NAT) function in
              particular, a data model for configuring and managing the
              NAT is essential.  [RFC8512] defines a YANG module for the
              NAT function covering a variety of NAT flavors such as
              Network Address Translation from IPv4 to IPv4 (NAT44),
              Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients
              to IPv4 Servers (NAT64), customer-side translator (CLAT),
              Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT), Explicit Address
              Mappings (EAM) for SIIT, IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix
              Translation (NPTv6), and Destination NAT.  [RFC8513]
              specifies a YANG module for the DS-Lite AFTR.

   Stateless Address Sharing:  [I-D.ietf-softwire-yang] specifies a YANG
              module for A+P address sharing, including Lightweight
              4over6, Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation
              (MAP-E), and Mapping of Address and Port using Translation
              (MAP-T) softwire mechanisms.

   Multicast: [I-D.ietf-pim-yang] defines a YANG module that can be used
              to configure and manage Protocol Independent Multicast
              (PIM) devices.  [I-D.ietf-pim-igmp-mld-yang] defines a
              YANG module that can be used to configure and manage
              Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast
              Listener Discovery (MLD) devices.  [I-D.ietf-pim-igmp-mld-
              snooping-yang] defines a YANG module that can be used to
              configure and manage Internet Group Management Protocol
              (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Snooping
              devices.

   EVPN:      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang] defines a YANG module for
              Ethernet VPN services.  The model is agnostic of the
              underlay.  It apply to MPLS as well as to VxLAN
              encapsulation.  The model is also agnostic of the services
              including E-LAN, E-LINE and E-TREE services.  This
              document mainly focuses on EVPN and Ethernet-Segment
              instance framework.

   L3VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l3vpn-yang] defines a YANG module that can
              be used to configure and manage BGP L3VPNs [RFC4364].  It
              contains VRF specific parameters as well as BGP specific
              parameters applicable for L3VPNs.

   L2VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] defines a YANG module for MPLS
              based Layer 2 VPN services (L2VPN) [RFC4664] and includes
              switching between the local attachment circuits.  The
              L2VPN model covers point-to-point VPWS and Multipoint VPLS
              services.  These services use signaling of Pseudowires
              across MPLS networks using LDP [RFC8077][RFC4762] or BGP
              [RFC4761].

   Routing Policy:  [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] defines a YANG module
              for configuring and managing routing policies in a vendor-
              neutral way and based on actual operational practice.  The
              model provides a generic policy framework which can be
              augmented with protocol-specific policy configuration.

   BFD:       [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang]defines a YANG module that can be used
              to configure and manage Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
              (BFD) [RFC5880].  BFD is a network protocol which is used
              for liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems.

   SR/SRv6:   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-yang] a YANG module for segment
              routing configuration and operation.  [I-D.raza-spring-
              srv6-yang] defines a YANG module for Segment Routing IPv6
              (SRv6) base.  The model serves as a base framework for
              configuring and managing an SRv6 subsystem and expected to
              be augmented by other SRv6 technology models accordingly.

   Core Routing:  [RFC8349] defines the core routing data model, which
              is intended as a basis for future data model development
              covering more-sophisticated routing systems.  It is
              expected that other Routing technology YANG modules (e.g.,
              VRRP, RIP, ISIS, OSPF models) will augment the Core
              Routing base YANG module.
