1. Abstract

   This memo describes the results of the first two interoperability
   tests of public key infrastructure (PKI) implementations based on
   RFC 2459, RFC 2510, and RFC 2511.  PKI implementations fall into
   three general classes: certification authorities (CAs), registration
   authorities (RAs), and PKI clients.  Interoperability testing
   focused on transactions to obtain and revoke certificates.

   Based on the anticipated (and observed) difficulty to get basic
   interoperability working, the testing scenarios used are very
   constrained.  Workshops for other IETF protocols have found that
   later workshops expand the testing scenarios until full
   functionality is met.

3. Introduction

   The PKI must be structured to be consistent with the types of
   individuals who must administer it.  Providing such administrators
   with unbounded choices not only complicates the software required
   but also increases the chances that a subtle mistake by an
   administrator or software developer will result in broader
   compromise.  Similarly, restricting administrators with cumbersome
   mechanisms will cause them not to use the PKI.

   Management protocols are REQUIRED to support on-line interactions
   between Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components.  For example, a
   management protocol might be used between a Certification Authority
   (CA) and a client system with which a key pair is associated, or
   between two CAs that issue cross-certificates for each other.

   More importantly, there MUST be proven interoperability of the
   management protocols between all of the PKI components.  The only
   way to ensure this is to start with interoperability workshops to
   prove out the protocols.  This report is the findings of the first
   two CMP/CMRF workshops.

   The workshop testing revolved around a set of scenarios that were
   thought would begin to exercise vendors code, and demonstrate the
   basics for a minimum PKI.  No attempt was made to match these
   scenarios against any published minimum PKI definitions.  Rather
   scenarios that would begin to exercise the protocol and highlight
   any issues in the protocol were selected.  Also some vendor
   viewpoints in the scenarios was inevitable at this initial phase, as
   that is the code available for testing.

   It is fully expected that the next round of workshops will build on
   these scenarios and move to convergence with other published works.

4. Background

   With the publishing of RFCs 2459, 2510 and 2511, the IETF has
   established the basic requirements to create and maintain a PKI.
   However, until there is joint implementer testing of the technology,
   the standards cannot advance in the IETF and there can be no user
   confidence in their ability to deploy a usable PKI.

   To this end, a series of workshops have been started to achieve
   product interoperability and to discover and resolve any issues with
   the RFCs.  This document presents the testing scenarios used in the
   workshops, sample results for the scenarios, and the issues revealed
   and proposed resolutions.

   Next steps is to expand the workshops to more participants and more
   scenarios and for the PKIX workgroup to address the issues revealed
   by the workshops.


5. Test Scenarios

   Four scenarios are proposed for initial interoperability testing.
   These scenarios:  Certificate bootstrap, Certificate Revocation,
   Additional Certificate request with the same Distinguished Name, and
   Additional Certificate request with a different Distinguished Name
   (i.e. a qualifying certificate) are sufficient to run a PKI.  For
   the purpose of the interoperability workshops, the qualifying
   certificate scenario was a stretch goal.

   Initial testing is done with the file protocol (RFC 2510, sec 5.1).
   This is followed with Direct TCP-Based (RFC 2510, sec 5.2, Port
   829).  Thus for Interoperability, these two protocols are considered
   a MUST to implement.


5.1 Scenario #1 Bootstrap (password based)

   The End Entity has an out of band (OOB) interaction or transaction
   with the CA/RA.  This transaction establishes the End Entities
   Distinguished Name (DN), a shared secret, and a CA/RA issued
   reference number.

   The EE will use the shared secret along with either the DN or
   reference number to send its certificate template in a CMP
   Initialization Request (IR) containing its public key and any other
   attributes to the CA.  This is done 'in band', that is using one of
   the 4 CMP transports.

   The CA will respond with a certificate that the EE either accepts or
   rejects.  Since the CMP transport can be asynchronous, or multiple
   transactions could be in process, the EE SHOULD use a transaction
   reference number to track the exchange.

   All clients SHOULD be able to support either IR identity method:

        Shared Secret and Reference #
        Shared Secret and DN

   Author∆s Question: After writing this, I see the model of only the
   Shared Secret is established.  The EE proposes its DN and the CA
   accepts or alters.  In this case, there would also not be a
   reference #.


   OOB
        CA/RA --> EE {shared secret information}
   IB
        EE --> CA/RA {ir}

        CA/RA --> EE {ip}

        EE --> CA/RA {conf}

5.3 Scenario #3  --  Additional Certificate request, Same DN

   An EE will need additional certificates throughout its 'life cycle'.
   Examples of this are: confidentiality certificates, special
   authenticating certificates, and attribute certificates.
   Additionally, certificates expire and need to be replaced, or an EE
   may simply wish to replace a valid certificate with a new key pair.
   All of these certificates can be obtained with a Certificate Request
   by the EE.  In some cases, the nature of the need for the additional
   request can be determined by the CA by examining the KeyUsage bits.

   Although there are other transactions in CMP for renewing keys,
   particularly kur, for existing certificates, the workshops have used
   this scenario to allow the use of certificate request for ALL
   additional certificates to allow for minimum interoperable
   implementations.  This MAY change by the time of the next workshop
   (if participants expand the scenarios in that direction).

   Additionally, this scenario was constrained to signature requests.
   The processing of requests for encryption [or confidentiality]
   certificates may introduce other considerations not addressed to
   date in the workshops.

5.4 Scenario #4   --  Additional Certificate request, Different DN
(qualifying cert)

   There are some important cases where the additional certificate
   needed by the EE must have a different DN than the EE's current
   signing certificate.  Examples of this are the OECD model for
   Qualifying Certificates, and some hardware vendor models to
   bootstrap one of their devices into a PKI by first getting a device
   ownership certificate from the hardware manufacturer and then using
   this to sign requests for usage certificates like IPsec or TLS.

6. Interoperability Agreements

6.1. DER encoding of PKIMessages

   Issue: RFC 2510 is ambiguous regarding the encoding of PKIMessage.
   The text requires DER-encoding the ProtectedPart (a SEQUENCE) before
   using it as the input to generate PKIProtection values, but does not
   require DER-encoding PKIMesaage (as opposed to BER-encoding).

Moskowitz                                                           15

         CMP Interoperability Testing: Results and Agreements June 1999



   However, the four protocols defined in section 5 all require DER-
   encoding of each PKIMessage.

   Resolution:  All messages must be DER-encoded.


6.2. Shared Secret

   Issue: The salt was handled differently by different participants.
   Which is the correct answer?

   Resolution:  The salt value is appended to the shared secret as
   specified in section 3.1.3 of RFC 2510.

6.3. Sender and Receiver Fields

   Issue: There is no consensus regarding whether sender and receiver
   fields in the PKIheader should be empty in ir messages.  Section
   3.1.1 of RFC 2510 explicitly allows an empty sender field, but is
   ambiguous about empty receiver fields.

   Resolution: Empty receiver and sender fields are appropriate when a
   requester appears at an RA in person.

   Where a client sends a request by another protocol, it must know an
   identity for itself and the receiver.  These may not be the "PKI
   names" (e.g., the DNs) but could instead be the IP address or email
   address used in the protocol.  In such a case, the sender and
   receiver should not be empty.

6.4  Proof of Possession

   Issue: The proof of possession for signing certificate requests is
   sometimes computed over the DER-encoded value of the certReq, and at
   other times computed over the popoSKInput field.

   According to RFC 2510, the proof of possession for signing
   certificate requests is computed over the DER-encoded value of the
   certReq message if the subject and subjectPublicKey values are
   present in the CertTemplate.  If either of these values/fields are
   not present, the popoSKInput field must be used.

   The popskInput field includes the public key and a choice of "an
   authenticated identity" or a "password-based MAC of the public key".
   However, this does not allow for several important scenarios: (1)
   Where an RA checks a requester∆s identity and modifies the
   CertTemplate, it cannot provide proof of possession to the CA, and
   (2) Where an entity has an "authenticated identity", but is
   requesting a different DN, it cannot supply all the required
   information.



Moskowitz                                                           16

         CMP Interoperability Testing: Results and Agreements June 1999


   Resolution: To clarify the situation, the following rules were
   proposed: (1) The public key must be present in the CertReq
   certTemplate. (2) If popskInput is present, the sender in the
   poposkInput must match the sender in the message header.  (3) If
   popskInput is present, the public key must be present in the
   poposkInput and must match the public key in the CertReq.  (4) If
   the poposkInput is present, it must be used as input to generate the
   signature for the proof of possession. If the poposkInput is
   omitted, the certReq must be used as the input to generate the
   signature for the proof of possession.

   [This does not entirely resolve the issue.  For a more complete
   solution, see 6.12.]

6.5  Nonces

   Issue:  Nonces are implemented by Entrust and Xeti; the NIST and IBM
   implementations do not.  The Baltimore Technologies implementation
   does not care/check for nonces.

   Nonces are required in B.8, B.9, and B.10 of RFC 2510.

   Although no realistic replay attack was identified it is not clear
   if nonces are required in rr and rp messages?

   Resolution:  For this testing, request messages may include the
   senderNonce, but they are not required.  Response messages must, at
   a minimum, include the recipNonce (with the request∆s senderNonce as
   the value) if the request included the senderNonce.

6.6  Handling subjectPublicKey Information

   Issue: There appears to be a problem with RFC 2511 regarding the
   handling of subjectPublicKey.  This field appears in CertTemplate
   and poposkInput, but it is not clear if it should appear in both
   places at the same time, either (and under what conditions), or in
   neither.

   Resolution:  For this testing, the subjectPublicKey should always be
   in the certTemplate, even if the popskInput field is present in the
   pop field

6.7  Revocation Details

   Issue: Is the crlEntryDetails field needed in the revDetails?  The
   contents of this field could be inconflict with other optional
   fields in revDetails (revocationReason and badSinceDate).

   According with RFC 2510 (Section 3.3.9), the reason for revocation
   and best guess of the time of loss or compromise should be
   represented in the revocationReason and badSinceDate fields, not
   crlEntryDetails.


Moskowitz                                                           17

         CMP Interoperability Testing: Results and Agreements June 1999


   This leaves only the instructionCode extension and certificateIssuer
   entry extensions.  The former is an "advanced" feature and propbably
   outisde our scope.  The latter is not information the requester
   should specify.

   Resolution: For this testing, crlEntryDetails, is not required.  If
   it appears in a revocation request it may ignored.

6.8  Extra Certificates Field

   Issue: Should the use of extraCerts field be required for
   interoperability?

   Resolution: Use of the extraCerts field is recommended, but is not
   required.  Implmenetations must be able to recieve and parse message
   with an extraCerts field.

6.9  Distinguished Name Encoding vs. String Representation

   Issue: The agreed convention for distinguished names is start with
   root and end with the leaf.  The agreed convention for the string
   representation is start with the leaf and end with the root.  The
   use of "@" as a delimiter is forbidden by the LDAP specs.

   Resolution:  DNs shall be encoded starting with the root and ending
   with the leaf.  String representations shall start with the leaf and
   end with the root. For the string representation, use commas as
   delimiters and not "@".

6.10 Shared Secret Length

   Issue: In the case of password-based message authentication codes,
   how long should the shared secret be?

   Resolution: TBD

6.11 Using PoPoSigningKey with PoPoskInput

   Issue: How is the input to the proof-of-possession computation
   formatted when it is based on poposkInput?

   Resolution:  According to Section 4.4, using poPoSigningKey when the
   poposkInput field is present, the value of the signature is
   generated using the complete DER-encoded structure. The outermost
   SEQUENCE tag must be included, rather than the explicit [0] that
   replaced it in the actual message.

6.12 Certificate Request and Proof of Possession

   Issue: The requester is required to provide proof of possession of
   the corresponding private key material when a signature certificate
   is requested.  It is useful to provide this proof to the CA, even
   where an RA verifies the requester∆s identity and modifies the

   certificate request.  The text describing the mechanisms for this
   purpose in RFC 2510 is somewhat contradictory.

   Interim Resolution: To clarify the situation, the following rules
   were proposed: (1) The sender in the poposkInput must match the
   sender in the message header.  (2) The public key must be present in
   the CertReq certTemplate.  (3) The public key must be present in the
   poposkInput and must match the public key in the CertReq.  (4) If
   the poposkInput is present, it must be used as input to generate the
   signature for the proof of possession. If the poposkInput is
   omitted, the certReq must be used as the input to generate the
   signature for the proof of possession.

   Long Range Resolution: The interim resolution is an improvement over
   the current text, but does not constitute a complete solution. The
   interim resolution also lacks elegance.  The following is proposed
   as a final resolution:

   PoposkInput ::= CHOICE {
                        Subject  name,
                        Sender  [0] generalName,
                        publicKeyMAC [1] PKMACValue
                                                }

   The pop is calculated upon the structure popInput, which is defined
   as follows:

   PopInput ::= SEQUENCE {
                        CHOICE {
                        otherinput   popskInput,
                        subject      name },
                        publicKey    subjectpublicKey
                        }

   If poposkInput is present in the pop field, popInput is constructed
   with otherinput.  If poposkInput is not present, subject is the name
   from CertTemplate.  Note that the encoding of PopInput is
   intentionally ambiguous.  If an RA

6.13 The PKIConfirm Message

   Issue: Some implementations expect to receive the "conf" message
   when issuing certificates, others do not.  (This applies to
   scenarios #1 and #3).  RFC 2510 requires the conf message in B.8 and
   B.9. This is straightforward for network-based protocols where the
   client and CA have a connection.  However, this is more problematic
   in file or electronic-mail based protocols.

   Resolution: For these trials, participants agreed to generate the
   conf message, but some CA implementations will not require it.

   Note: All participants agreed that the CA should not require a conf
   message for certificate revocation transactions.

6.14 OldCertID

   Issue: When is oldCertID control used?  Perhaps kur only?

   Resolution: Participants agreed that oldCertID will not be used in
   these trials.


6.15 Using senderKID and transactionID

   Issue: When establishing an initial relationship (i.e., scenario
   #1), the end entity obtains a shared secret and either a
   distinguished name OR a reference code.  The shared secret is
   associated with the end entity through the name or code.  Where the
   reference code is used, there are two "logical" places to insert it.
   It might be considered the sender∆s key identifier, and placed in
   the senderKID.  The reference code could also be considered a
   transactionID established by the RA.

   Both are compromises of sorts.  The former solution overloads the
   senderKID, requiring different processing in different contexts.
   (In other contexts, the senderKID would correspond to the subject
   key identifier in certificates.)  A transactionID is still required,
   as well.  The latter solution overloads the transactionID.

   Resolution:  TBD.  (Note: RFC 2510 supports using the senderKID for
   this purpose.)

6.16 SHA-1 HMAC

   Issue: This is really four related questions: (1) What is the
   correct MAC algorithm for the password-based MAC?  (2) Which one-way
   function should it be used with?  (3) How long should the password
   be? And (4) What iteration count should we use?

   Resolution: Use SHA1-HMAC, OID={1.3.6.1.5.5.8.12} as the MAC
   algorithm for IR-message protection. SHA-1 will be the one-way
   function.  The password and the salt should be at least 20-bytes.
   The iteration count shall be 1024.

6.16 Passphrase Encoding

   Issue: Because the passphrase for passphrase-based MAC may be
   entered through a keyboard, it is necessary to convert the user-
   provided string into an unambiguous string.  The purpose is to
   handle properly specific language nuances (e.g., accents and tildes
   in certain languages). The options are either encoding of passphrase
   as a binary (un-transformed) input to the function or performing a
   well defined transform on the input text.

   The former requires that the application be able to unambiguously
   determine the binary data (which may be difficult in the case of a

         CMP Interoperability Testing: Results and Agreements June 1999


   user selected passphrase). The latter requires the use of a possibly
   difficult to implement, probably not fully standards compliant
   transform.

   Resolution: The passphrase should be encoded as a Unicode input
   using UNICODE normalization rules (See DRAFT Unicode Technical
   Report #15: Unicode Normalization Forms, version 14, Normalization
   Form D - specification from sections 3.6, 3.9, and 3.10 of the
   Unicode Standard ISBN 0-201-48345-9)and encode as a UTF8 string
   (without tag or length).


6.17 Reason flags for revocation in revocation requests

   Issue: The use of a bit mask for reason codes may be inappropriate
   for all possible reasons and the interpretation of reason bit
   combinations may be ambiguous and inappropriate.

   Resolution: The reason codes should be placed in the relevant
   extension of the crlEntryDetails of RevDetails.


6.18 Use of badSinceDate for revocation in revocation requests

   Issue: Since the crlEntryDetails of RevDetails is going to be used
   for the reason flags (see 6.17) and badSinceDate is a different
   field in RevDetails, an optimization can be done by placing the
   badSinceDate information into the crlEntryDetails.

   Resolution: The bad since date of a revoked certificate should be
   placed in the relevant extension of the crlEntryDetails of
   RevDetails.


6.19 Certificate requests and key usage

   Issue: The certificate request messages may be used for requesting
   different types of certificates and there needs to be away to
   distinguish the request for different certificate types.

   Resolution: For each certificate requested in the certificate
   request message, there should be one key usage extension within the
   certTemplate.


6.20 Signing of messages with a key different from the certificate
     signing key

   Issue: A CA may sign a cp and rp messages using a key other than the
   key used to sign certificates. In order to support this, the CA/RA
   needs to pass the message signing certificate to the end entity.



Moskowitz                                                           21

         CMP Interoperability Testing: Results and Agreements June 1999


   Resolution: The CA/RA shall pass the message signing certificate,
   and if necessary all other certificates in the validation chain, in
   the extraCerts field of the PKIMessage. These certificates shall
   appear in starting with the message signing certificate followed by
   the necessary certificates for the chain in reverse order to the top
   of the chain. The "root" certificate may be omitted since its
   assumed to the be CA certificate used to sign certificates.


6.21 Use of TCP/IP as the transport protocol

   Issue: The use of TCP/IP as the transport protocol is under
   specified in RFC 2510. For example, the polling protocol is
   incomplete and ambiguous.

   Resolution: TBD


6.22 Purpose of publicKeyMac in POPOSigningKeyInput

   Issue: It is unclear what is the purpose of the publicKeyMac in
   POPOSigningKeyInput. When should it be checked? What attack(s) does
   it protect against? Should it always be there or is it used in lieu
   of other mechanisms.

   Resolution: TBD



7. Security Considerations

   In PasswordBasedMac, minimum values for the salt, the
   iterationCount, and the shared secret are not specified.  According
   to PKCS #5 [PKCS5], the salt should be at least 8 octets long.  The
   iterationCount should be at least 1000, and the salt concatenated
   with the shared secret should be at least as long as the hash value.
   For our default of SHA1, this is 20 octets; so for interoperability,
   the shared secret must be at least 12 octets.

   Since the CA/RA signs almost all responses, it SHOULD have a
   response signing certificate for this function, and not use its root
   certificate (see Interoperability Agreements, 6.n).  These response
   signing certificates can be short-lived and have relatively short
   keys.


8. IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations have emerged.
