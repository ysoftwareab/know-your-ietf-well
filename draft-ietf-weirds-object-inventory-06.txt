      Registration Data Access Protocol Object Inventory Analysis
                 draft-ietf-weirds-object-inventory-06

Abstract

   WHOIS output objects from registries (including both Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)) were
   collected and analyzed.  This document describes the statistical
   analysis process and results of the analysis of existing WHOIS
   information.  The purpose of this document is to build an object
   inventory to facilitate discussions of data objects included in
   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) responses.

Internet-Draft     Registration Data Object Inventory       October 2014


1.  Introduction

   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)
   have historically maintained a lookup service to permit public access
   to some portion of the registry database.  Most registries offer the
   service via the WHOIS protocol [RFC3912], with additional services
   being offered via world wide web pages, bulk downloads, and other
   services, such as Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)
   [RFC2622].

   Although the WHOIS protocol is widely adopted and supported, it has
   several shortcomings that limit its usefulness to the evolving needs
   of the Internet community.  Specifically,

   o  It has no query and response format.

   o  It does not support user authentication and access control for
      differentiated access.

   o  It has not been internationalized and thus does not consistently
      support Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs, described in
      [RFC5890]).

   This document records an inventory of registry data objects to
   facilitate discussions of registration data objects.  The
   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
   ([I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query], [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response],
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http] and [I-D.ietf-weirds-bootstrap]) was
   developed using this inventory as input.

   In the number space, there were altogether five RIRs.  Although all
   RIRs provided information about IP addresses, Autonomous System
   Numbers (ASNs) and contacts, the data model used was different for
   each RIR.  In the domain name space, there were over 200 country code
   Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs) and over 400 generic Top-Level Domains
   (gTLDs) when the document was published.  Different domain name
   registries may have different WHOIS response objects and formats.  A
   common understanding of all these data formats was critical to
   construct a single data model for each object.

   This document describes the WHOIS data collection procedures and
   gives a data object inventory analysis based on the collected data
   from five RIRs and 106 ccTLDs and 18 gTLDs from DNRs.  The RIR data
   objects are classified by the five RIRs into IP address, ASN, person
   or contact and the organization that held the resource.  According to
   the SPECIFICATION 4 (SPECIFICATION FOR REGISTRATION DATA PUBLICATION
   SERVICES) of new gTLD applicant guide book [ICANN.AGB-201206] and the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) ([RFC5730], [RFC5731],

   [RFC5732] and [RFC5733]), the DNR data objects are classified into
   domain, contact, nameserver and registrar related objects.  Other
   objects that do not belong to above categories are viewed as private
   designed objects.  In this document, there is no intent to analyze
   all the query and response types existed in RIRs and DNRs.  The most
   common query objects are discussed, but other objects such as RPSL
   data structures used by Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) can be
   documented later if the community feels it is necessary.

2.  Terminology

   o  Data element -- The name of specific response object.

   o  Label -- The name given to a particular data element, which may
      vary between registries.

   o  Most popular label -- The label which is most supported by the
      registries.

   o  Number of labels -- The number of different labels.

   o  Total count -- The number of registries that support a certain
      data element.

3.  Methodology

   WHOIS information, including port 43 response and web response data,
   was collected between July 9th, 2012 and July 20th, 2012 following
   the procedures described below.

   (1)  First, find the RIR WHOIS servers of five RIRs which are
        AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC and RIPE NCC.  All the RIRs provide
        information of IPs, ASNs and contacts.

   (2)  Query the corresponding IPs, ASNs, contacts and organizations
        registered in five RIRs and make a comparative analysis of the
        responses data.

   (3)  Data elements with the same meaning, but using different labels,
        were grouped together.

   DNR objects collections process:

   (1)  A programming script was applied to collect port 43 response
        data from 294 ccTLDs. "nic.ccTLD" is used as the query string,
        which is usually registered in a domain registry.  Responses for
        106 ccTLDs were received. 18 gTLDs' port 43 response data was

        collected from their contracts with ICANN.  Thus, the sample
        size of port 43 WHOIS response data is 124 registries in total.

   (2)  WHOIS data from web was collected manually from the 124
        registries that send port 43 WHOIS responses.

   (3)  Some of the responses which were collected by the program did
        not seem to be correct, so data of the top 10 ccTLD registries,
        like .de, .eu and .uk etc., was re-verified by querying domain
        names other than "nic.ccTLD".

   (4)  In accordance with the SPECIFICATION 4 of new gTLD applicant
        guide book [ICANN.AGB-201206] and the Extensible Provisioning
        Protocol (EPP) ([RFC5730], [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733]),
        the response data objects are classified into public and other
        data objects.  Public data objects are those which are defined
        in the above references.  Other objects are those which are
        privately specified data elements or objects in different
        registries.

   (5)  Data elements with the same meaning, but using different labels,
        were grouped together.  The numbers of registries that support
        the data elements are shown in the total count column.

4.3.  WHOIS data for IP Addresses

   The table 4 shows the IP address objects of five RIRs.

   Note: Because the length limit of each line is 72 characters, too
   long strings in some table unites are split into two or more parts,
   which are placed in order in different lines of the same table unit.
   A hyphen in the final position of a string indicates this string and
   the one in the next line of the same table unit are divided because
   of the length limit.

4.5.  Conclusion

   As it could be observed, some data elements were not supported by all
   RIRs and some ones were named as different labels by different RIRs.
   There were identical labels used for different data elements by
   different RIRs.  In order to construct a single data model for each
   object, a selection of the most common and useful fields was made.
   That initial selection was the starting point for
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].

5.  DNR Objects Analysis

5.1.  Overview

   WHOIS data was collected from 124 registries, including 106 ccTLDs
   and 18 gTLDs.  All the 124 registries support domain queries.  Among
   124 registries, eight ccTLDs and 15 gTLDs support queries for
   specific contact persons or roles. 10 ccTLDs and 18 gTLDs support
   queries by nameserver.  Four ccTLDs and 18 gTLDs support registrar
   queries.  Domain WHOIS data contain 68 data elements that use a total
   of 550 labels.  There is a total of 392 other objects for domain
   WHOIS data.  The raw data can be accessed at WHOIS Statistics Data
   File [Stat-Data-File].

5.2.  Public Objects

   As mentioned above, public objects are those data elements selected
   according to the new gTLD applicant guide book and EPP protocols.
   They are generally classified into four categories: domain, contact,
   nameserver and registrar related information.

5.2.1.  WHOIS Data for Domains

   WHOIS replies about domains include "Domain Name", "Creation Date",
   "Domain Status", "Expiration Date", "Updated Date", "Domain ID",
   "DNSSEC" and "Last Transferred Date".  The table 6 gives the element
   name, most popular label and corresponding numbers of TLDs and
   labels.

                     Table 6.  WHOIS Data for Domains

   Several statistical conclusion that obtained from above data include:

   o  About 95.16% of the 124 registries support a "Domain Name" data
      element.

   o  Nearly 85.48% of the 124 registries support a "Creation Date" data
      element.

   o  Almost 76.61% of the 124 registries support a "Domain Status" data
      element

   o  On the other hand, some elements such as "DNSSEC" and "Last
      Transferred Date" are only supported by 11.29% and 3.23% of all
      the registries seperately.

5.2.2.  WHOIS Data for Contacts

   In the domain name space, contacts are typically divided into
   registrant, administrative contact, technical contact and billing
   contact.

                    Table 13.  The Top 50 Other Objects

   Some registries returned things that looked like labels, but were
   not.  For example, in this reply:


         Registrant:
           Name:
           Email:
           ...


   "Name" and "Email" appeared to be data elements, but "Registrant" was
   not.  The inventory work proceeded on that assumption, i.e., there
   were two data elements to be recorded in this example.

   Some other data elements, like "Remarks", "anniversary" and "Customer
   service Contact" etc., are designed particularly for their own
   purpose by different registries.

5.4.  Conclusion

5.4.1.  Preliminary Statistics

   Some preliminary conclusions could be drawn from the raw data.

   o  All of the 124 domain registries have the object names in their
      responses although they are in various formats.

   o  Of the 118 WHOIS services contacted, 65 registries show their
      registrant contact.  About half of the registries (60 registries)
      support admin contact information.  There are 47 registries, which
      is about one third of the total number, have technical and billing

      contact information.  Only seven of all the 124 registries give
      their abuse email in a "remarks" section.  No explicit abuse
      contact information is provided.

   o  There are mainly two presentation formats.  One is key:value, the
      other is data block format.  Example of key-value format:

                    Table 14.  The Top 10 Data Elements

   Most of the domain related WHOIS information is included in the top
   10 data elements.  Other information like name server and registrar
   name are also supported by most registries.

   A cumulative distribution analysis of all the data elements was done.

   (1)  About 5% of the data elements discovered by the inventory work
        are supported by over 111 (90%) registries.

   (2)  About 30% of the data elements discovered by the inventory work
        are supported by over 44 (35%) registries.

   (3)  About 60% of the data elements discovered by the inventory work
        are supported by over 32 (26%) registries.

   (4)  About 90% of the data elements discovered by the inventory work
        are supported by over 14 (11%) registries.

   From the above result, it is clear that only a few registries support
   all the public objects, most of the registries support just some of
   all the objects.

   The top 10 labels of different data elements include:

                      |      Admin ID     |       16      |

                      +-------------------+---------------+

                       Table 15.  The Top 10 Labels

   As explained above, the "Name Server" label is a unique example that
   many registries define the name server elements from "nameserver 1"
   till "nameserver n".  Thus, the count of labels for name servers is
   much higher than other elements.  Data elements representing dates
   and street addresses were also common.

   A cumulative distribution analysis of label numbers was done.  About
   90% of data elements have more than two labels.  It is therefore
   necessary to specify a standard and unified format for object names
   in a WHOIS response.

5.4.4.  Other Objects Analysis

   The results indicate that there are 392 other data objects in total
   that are not easy to be classified or are privately defined by
   various registries.  The top 50 other objects are listed in the table
   in section 4.3.  It is clear that various different objects are
   designed for some particular purpose.  In order to ensure uniqueness

   of JSON names used in the RDAP service, establishment of an IANA
   registry is advised.

5.5.  Limitations

   This section enumerates limitations of the survey and some
   assumptions that were made in the execution of this work.

   o  The input "nic.ccTLD" maybe is not a good choice, for the term
      "nic" is often specially used by the corresponding ccTLD so the
      collected WHOIS data may be customized and different from the
      common data.

   o  Since the programming script queried the "nic.ccTLD" in an
      anonymous way, only the public WHOIS data from WHOIS servers
      having nic.ccTLD were collected.  So the private WHOIS data were
      not covered by this document.

   o  11 registries did not provide responses in English.  The
      classification of data elements within their responses may not be
      accurate.

   o  The extension data elements are used randomly by different
      registries.  It is difficult to do statistical analysis.

   o  Sample sizes of contact, name server and registrar queries are
      small.

      *  Only WHOIS queries for contact ID, nameserver and registrar
         were used.

      *  Some registries may not support contact, name server or
         registrar queries.

      *  Some may not support query contact by ID.

      *  Contact information of some registries may be protected.

6.  Reference Extension Objects

   There are some objects that are included in the existing WHOIS system
   but not mentioned in [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].  This document
   is intended to give a list of reference extension objects for
   discussion.

6.1.  RIR Reference Extension Objects

   o  company -- the company name registered by the registrant.

   o  maintainer -- authentication information that identifies who can
      modify the contents of this object.

   o  list of resources -- a list of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses and
      Autonomous System numbers.

   o  referral NOC contact -- the Network Operation Center contact.

6.2.  DNR Reference Extension Objects

   The following objects are selected from the top 50 other objects in
   section 5.3 that are supported by more than five registries.  These
   objects are considered as possible extension objects.

   o  zone-c -- The identifier of a 'role' object with authority over a
      zone.

   o  maintainer -- authentication information that identifies who can
      modify the contents of this object.

   o  Registration URL -- typically the website address of a registry.

   o  anonymous -- whether the registration information is anonymous or
      not.

   o  hold -- whether the domain is "on hold" or not.

   o  nsl-id -- nameserver list ID.

   o  obsoleted -- whether a domain is obsoleted or not.

   o  Customer Service Contact -- a kind of contact.
