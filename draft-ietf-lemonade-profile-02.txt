Abstract 
    
   This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions, 
   restrictions and usage modes) of mail protocols such as IMAP and 
   Submission. This profile allows clients (especially those that are 
   constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas) 
   to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail. 
   This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to 
   download and upload the mail, to schedule future delivery of a 
   message, to optimize submission and to efficiently reconnect in case 
   of loss of connectivity with the server.  
    
   The Lemonade profile relies upon extensions to various protocols; 
   specifically URLAUTH, CATENATE, Lemonade Command Extensions in the 
   IMAP protocol [RFC3501] and BURL in the SUBMIT protocol [RFC2476].

1.    Introduction 
    
   Lemonade provides enhancements to Internet email to support diverse 
   service environments.  
    
   This document describes the lemonade profile that includes: 
      - The Lemonade Pull Model that describes exchanges between 
        Lemonade Agents to allow clients to submit new email messages 
        incorporating content which resides on locations external to 
        the client and allow forward without download. 
      - Media conversion 
      - Quick reconnect   
    
   The organization of this document is as follows.  Section 2 describes 
   the Lemonade Pull Model. Section 3 Section 3 describes the Media 
   Conversion. Section 4 describes quick reconnect  
    
2.   Forward without download 
    
2.1.     Motivations 
    
   The advent of client/server email using the [RFC3501] and [RFC2821] 
   protocols has changed what formerly were local disk operations to 
   become excessive and repetitive network data transmissions.  
    
   The Lemonade Pull Model makes use of the [BURL] SUBMIT extension to 
   enable access to external sources during the submission of a message.  
   In combination with the IMAP [URLAUTH] extension, inclusion of 
   message parts or even entire messages from the IMAP mail store is 
   possible with a minimal trust relationship between the IMAP and SMTP 
   SUBMIT servers. 
    
   Pull has the advantage of maintaining one submission protocol, and 
   thus avoids the risk of having multiple parallel and possible 
   divergent mechanisms for submission.  Furthermore, by keeping the 
   details of message submission in the SMTP SUBMIT server, the Lemonade 
   Pull Model can work with other message retrieval protocols such as 
   POP, NNTP, or whatever else may be designed in the future. 
    
2.2.     Message Sending Overview 
    
   The act of sending an email message is best thought of as involving 
   multiple steps: initiation of a new draft, draft editing, message 
   assembly, and message submission. 
    
   Initiation of a new draft and draft editing takes place on the MUA. 
   Frequently, users choose to save more complex messages on an 
   [RFC3501] server (via the APPEND command with the \Draft flag) for 
   later recall by the MUA and resumption of the editing process.

   Message assembly is the process of producing a complete message from 
   the final revision of the draft and external sources.  At assembly 
   time, external data is retrieved and inserted in the message. 
    
   Message submission is the process of inserting the assembled message 
   into the [RFC2821] infrastructure, typically using the [RFC2476] 
   protocol. 
    
2.3.     Traditional Strategy 
    
   Traditionally, messages are initiated, edited, and assembled entirely 
   within an MUA, although drafts may be saved to an [RFC3501] server 
   and later retrieved from the server.  The completed text is then 
   transmitted to an MSA for delivery. 
    
   There is often no clear boundary between the editing and assembly 
   process.  If a message is forwarded, its content is often retrieved 
   immediately and inserted into the message text.  Similarly, once 
   external content is inserted or attached, the content is usually 
   retrieved immediately and made part of the draft. 
    
   As a consequence, each save of a draft and subsequent retrieve of the 
   draft transmits that entire (possibly large) content, as does message 
   submission. 
    
   In the past, this was not much of a problem, because drafts, external 
   data, and the message submission mechanism were typically located on 
   the same system as the MUA.  The most common problem was running out 
   of disk quota.

2.4.     Step by step description 
    
   The model distinguishes between a Messaging User Agent (MUA), an 
   IMAPv4Rev1 Server ([RFC3501]) and a SMTP submit server ([RFC2476]), 
   as illustrated in Figure 1.

                                             +--------------+ 
                     Figure 1: Lemonade Pull Model 
             
    
   The Lemonade Pull Model allows a Messaging User Agent to compose and 
   forward an e-mail combining fragments that are located in an IMAP 
   server, without having to download these fragments to the server. 
    
   In the [BURL]/[CATENATE] variant of the pull strategy, messages are 
   initially composed and edited within an MUA.  The [CATENATE] 
   extension to [RFC3501] is then used to upload the message to the IMAP 
   server and assemble it, and finally a [URLAUTH] format URL is given 
   to a [RFC2476] server with the [BURL] extension for submission. 
 
   The flow involved to support such a use case consists of: 
      M: {to I -- Optional} The client connectects to the IMAP server 
     and IMAP Fetch of body structures and UIDs (See [RFC3501]) 
      
     Example: 
           M: A0051 FETCH 161 (UID BODYSTRUCTURE)

2.5.     Normative statements related to forward without download 
    
   Lemonade compliant mail server MUST therefore respectively support 
   IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501], CATENATE [CATENATE] and URLAUTH [URLAUTH]. Its 
   support MUST be declared via CAPABILITY [RFC3501]. 
    
   Lemonade compliant SMTP submit servers MUST support BURL extensions 
   [BURL]. Its support MUST be declared via EHLO [RFC2821]. 
    
   A Lemonade client SHOULD support IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501], CATENATE 
   [CATENATE], BURL extensions [BURL] and URLAUTH [URLAUTH].  
    
   Additional normative statements are provided in other sections. 
 
2.6.     Additional Considerations 
    
   The so-called "pawn-ticket" authorization mechanism uses a URI which 
   contains its own authorization credentials using [URLAUTH].  The 
   advantage of this mechanism is that the SMTP submit [RFC2476] server 
   can not access any data on the [RFC3501] server without a "pawn-
   ticket" created by the client.  The "pawn-ticket" grants acces only 
   to the specific data that the SMTP submit [RFC2476] server is 
   authorized to access, can be revoked by the client, and can have a

2.7.     The fcc problem 
    
   The "fcc problem" refers to a frequent need to deliver a copy of the 
   message to a "file carbon copy" recipient.  By far, the most common 
   case of fcc is a client leaving a copy of outgoing mail in a "sent 
   messages" or "outbox" mailbox. 
    
   In the traditional strategy, the MUA duplicates the effort spent in 
   transmitting to the MSA by writing the message to the fcc destination 
   in a separate step.  This may be a write to a local disk file or an 
   APPEND to a mailbox on an IMAP server.  The latter is one of the 
   "excessive and repetitive network data transmissions" which 
   represents the "problem" aspect of the "fcc problem". 
    
   The [CATENATE] extension to [RFC3501] addresses the fcc problem.  It 
   requires making several simplifying assumptions: 
       (1a) there is one, and only one, fcc destination on a single 
   server 
       (2a) the server which holds the fcc is the same as the server 
   which stages the outgoing message for submission 
       (3a) it is desired that the fcc be a copy of the complete message 
   text with all external data inserted in the message 
    
   << EditorÆs note: [POSTADDRESS] can be used to address issues (1a) 
   and (2a). To be done later>> 
    
3.   Message Submission 
    
   LEMONADE compliant SMTP submission server are expected to implement a 
   set of SMTP extensions to make message submission efficient.  The 
   clients SHOULD take advantage of these features. 
    
 
3.1.     Future Delivery 
    
   Diverse devices may suffer from intermittent or unpredictable 
   connectivity.  Although this does not address the main issues of 
   intermittent connectivity, it may be of interest to email users to be 
   able to take advantage of future delivery by marking ahead of time a 
   message for future submission into the mail system.   
    
   For well-connected devices, the client can hold a message in the 
   conceptual "outbox" until an appointed time, and then release the 
   message.  Otherwise, the client may need to rely upon a well-
   connected server for this function.   
    
   LEMONADE compliant SMTP submission servers MUST declare via ELHO 
   [RFC2821] the support the SMTP service extension for future delivery.

                          <Lemonade Profile>               April 2005 
 
 
    
   If future delivery is not permitted by policy, the server MAY not 
   support (and declare) support for future delivery or the SMTP 
   submission server may advertise a future delivery interval of zero 
   seconds. 
    
   <<EditorÆs note: The latest version of FUTUREDELIVERY doesn't allow a 
   compliant server to advertise the interval of 0. This should be 
   addressed or remove here >> 
    
   LEMONADE clients requiring the ability to reliably send future 
   delivery messages can discover via EHLO if a lemonade SMTP submission 
   server supports the SMTP service extension for future deliver [Future 
   delivery].   
    
   When dealing with an device that support future delivery, such 
   clients may cache or otherwise remember the advertised future 
   delivery interval from a previous submission transaction to guide the 
   human user into the selection of a valid future delivery interval.   
    
 
3.2.     Pipelining 
    
   Mobile clients regularly use networks with a relatively high latency.  
   Avoidance of round-trips within a transaction has a great advantage 
   for the reduction in both bandwidth and total transaction time.  For 
   this reason Lemonade servers and clients should use SMTP command 
   pipelining for message submission. 
    
   LEMONADE compliant SMTP submission servers MUST support the SMTP 
   Service Extensions for Command Pipelining. [REF2197]   
    
   Clients SHOULD pipeline. 
    
3.3.     TLS 
    
   LEMONADE clients may use the BURL extension to SMTP Submission, a 
   protocol that requires sending a URLAUTH token to the SMTP submission 
   server.  Such a token should be protected from interception to avoid 
   a replay attack that will disclose the contents of the message to an 
   attacker.  TLS based encryption of the SMTP submission path will 
   provide protection against this attack. 
    
   LEMONADE Compliant SMTP submission servers MUST support SMTP Service 
   Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS [RFC2487] supporting at least SASL 
   PLAIN [RFC2595] authentication.

   LEMONADE clients SHOULD use TLS protected SMTP submission channels 
   when using BURL-based message submission to protect the URLAUTH token 
   from interception. 
    
    
3.4.     DSN Support 
    
   It is expected that a LEMONADE compliant SMTP submission servers 
   supports delivery status notifications.   
    
   LEMONADE compliant SMTP submission servers MUST support SMTP service 
   extensions for delivery status notifications [RFC3461] and enhanced 
   status codes.   
    
   <<EditorÆs note: Enhanced status code may lead to a separate 
   section>> 
    
    
3.5.     Message size declaration 
    
   LEMONADE compliant SMTP submission servers MUST support the SMTP 
   Service Extension for Message Size Declaration [RFC2927] 
    
    
4.   Quick Reconnect scheme 
    
   Mobile operators usually charge users for the time their mobile 
   client gets connected to the Internet and/or for the amount of 
   information sent/received. Thus a mobile client should minimize time 
   it stays connected to its mail server, which suggests that it should 
   disconnect and reconnect frequently. 
    
   Also, it is possible that the mobile client unexpectedly leaves area 
   of connectivity, which will require that the client reconnects when 
   connectivity returns. 
    
   << EditorÆs note: Discussion about voluntarily versa non-voluntarily 
   disconnects might go here>> 
    
   IMAP can be verbose. Usually, in order to synchronize a client with a 
   server after a disconnect, the client needs to issue at least the 
   following commands: LOGIN/AUTHENTICATE, SELECT and several FETCH 
   commands (see [IMAP-DISC] for more details). 
    
   Thus, there is a desire to have a quick reconnect facility in IMAP, 
   which will give a mobile client ability to resume a previously 
   abandoned session, without the need to perform the full 
   synchronization sequence as described above.

4.1.     Normative statements related to quick reconnect schemes 
    
   Lemonade compliant mail server MUST support the quick reconnect 
   scheme described above. 
    
   A Lemonade client SHOULD support the quick reconnect scheme described 
   above. 
 
5.   Future work 
    
   Future versions of the Lemonade profile are expected to address 
   issues related to access of email form mobile devices, possibly 
   including: 
      - Address editorÆs notes 
      - Recommendations in terms of support of Binary and 8-bit MIME 
        Transport 
      - Media conversion (static and streamed) 
      - transport optimization for low or costly bandwidth and less 
        reliable mobile networks 
      - server to client notifications outside of the traditional IMAP 
        band 
      - dealing with firewall and intermediaries 
      - compression

   throughout section 2. 
    
   << EditorÆs note: TBD (Reconnect, etc.)>> 
    
IANA Considerations 
    
   Lemonade profile extensions should be appropriately related to the 
   list of IMAP and SMTP parameters.
