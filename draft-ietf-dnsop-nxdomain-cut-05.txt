           NXDOMAIN really means there is nothing underneath
                    draft-ietf-dnsop-nxdomain-cut-05

Abstract

   This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a
   response with response code of NXDOMAIN, it means that the domain
   name which is thus denied AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist.

   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document should be discussed in the
   IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing list.  The
   source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is
   currently kept at Github [1].

   This documents clarifies RFC 1034 and modifies a portion of RFC 2308,
   so it updates both of them.

1.  Introduction and background

   The DNS protocol [RFC1035] defines response code 3 as "Name Error",
   or "NXDOMAIN" [RFC2308], which means that the queried domain name
   does not exist in the DNS.  Since domain names are represented as a
   tree of labels ([RFC1034], Section 3.1), non-existence of a node
   implies non-existence of the entire sub-tree rooted at this node.

   The DNS iterative resolution algorithm precisely interprets the
   NXDOMAIN signal in this manner.  If it encounters an NXDOMAIN
   response code from an authoritative server, it immediately stops
   iteration and returns the NXDOMAIN response to the querier.

   However, in most known existing resolvers today, a cached non-
   existence for a domain is not considered "proof" that there can be no
   child domains underneath.  This is due to an ambiguity in [RFC1034]

   that failed to distinguish Empty Non-Terminal names (ENT) ([RFC7719])
   from nonexistent names (Section 3.1).  The distinction became
   especially important for the development of DNSSEC, which provides
   proof of non-existence.  [RFC4035], section 3.1.3.2, describes how
   security-aware authoritative name servers make the distinction, but
   no existing RFCs describe the behavior for recursive name servers.

   This document specifies that an NXDOMAIN response for a domain name
   means that no child domains underneath the queried name exist either.
   And furthermore, that DNS resolvers should interpret cached non-
   existence in this manner.  Since the domain names are organized in a
   tree, it is a simple consequence of the tree structure: non-existence
   of a node implies non-existence of the entire sub-tree rooted at this
   node.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "Denied name": the domain name whose existence has been denied by a
   response of rcode NXDOMAIN.  In most cases, it is the QNAME but,
   because of [RFC6604], it is not always the case.

   Other terms are defined in [RFC1034] or [RFC1035] or (like NXDOMAIN
   itself) in the more recent [RFC7719].

   The domain name space is conceptually defined in terms of a tree
   structure.  The implementation of a DNS resolver/cache MAY use a tree
   or other data structures.  The cache being a subset of the data in
   the domain name space, it is much easier to reason about it in terms
   of that tree structure and to describe things in those terms (names
   under/above, descendent names, subtrees etc).  In fact, the DNS
   algorithm description in [RFC1034] even states an assumption that the
   cache is a tree structure, so the precedent is already well
   established: see its section 4.3.2 which says "The following
   algorithm assumes that the RRs are organized in several tree
   structures, one for each zone, and another for the cache..." So, in
   this document, each time we talk of a tree or tree operations, it
   refers to the model, not to the actual implementation.

2.  Rule

   When an iterative caching DNS resolver receives a response NXDOMAIN,
   it SHOULD store it in its cache and all names and RRsets at or below
   that node SHOULD then be considered to be unreachable.  Subsequent
   queries for such names SHOULD elicit an NXDOMAIN response.

Internet-Draft                NXDOMAIN cut                September 2016


   But if a resolver has cached data under the NXDOMAIN cut, it MAY
   continue to send it as a reply (until the TTL of this cached data
   expires), since this may avoid additional processing when a query is
   received.  Section 6 provides more information about this.

   Another exception is that a validating resolver MAY decide to
   implement the "NXDOMAIN cut" behaviour (described in the first
   paragraph of this section) only when the NXDOMAIN response has been
   validated with DNSSEC.  See Section 8 for the rationale.

   The fact that a subtree does not exist is not forever: [RFC2308],
   section 3, already describes the amount of time that an NXDOMAIN
   response may be cached (the "negative TTL").

   If the NXDOMAIN response due to a cached non-existence is from a
   DNSSEC signed zone, then it will have accompanying NSEC or NSEC3
   records that authenticate the non-existence of the name.  For a
   descendant name of the original NXDOMAIN name, the same set of NSEC
   or NSEC3 records proves the non-existence of the descendant name.
   The iterative, caching resolver MUST return these NSEC or NSEC3
   records in the response to the triggering query if the query had the
   DNSSEC OK (DO) bit set.

   Warning: if there is a chain of CNAME (or DNAME), the name which does
   not exist is the last of the chain ([RFC6604]) and not the QNAME.
   The NXDOMAIN stored in the cache is for the denied name, not always
   for the QNAME.

   As an example of the consequence of these rules, consider two
   successive queries to a resolver, with a non-existing domain
   'foo.example': the first is for 'foo.example' (which results in an
   NXDOMAIN) and the second for 'bar.foo.example' (which also results in
   an NXDOMAIN).  Many resolvers today will forward both queries, as
   noticed in Section 9.  However, following the rules in this document
   ("NXDOMAIN cut"), a resolver would cache the first NXDOMAIN response,
   as a sign of non-existence, and then immediately return an NXDOMAIN
   response for the second query, without transmitting it to an
   authoritative server.

   If the first request is for 'bar.foo.example' and the second for
   'baz.foo.example', the first NXDOMAIN response won't tell anything
   about 'baz.foo.example' and therefore the second query will be
   transmitted as it was before the use of "NXDOMAIN cut" optimisation
   (see Appendix A).

3.  Updates to RFCs

3.1.  Updates to RFC1034

   This document clarifies possible ambiguities in [RFC1034] that did
   not clearly distinguish Empty Non-Terminal names (ENT) ([RFC7719])
   from nonexistent names, and refers to subsequent documents that do.
   Empty Non-Terminals are nodes in the DNS that have no resource record
   sets associated with them, but have descendant nodes that do.  The
   correct response to Empty Non-Terminals is NODATA (i.e. a response
   code of NOERROR and an empty ANSWER section).  Additional clarifying
   language on these points is provided in section 7.16 of [RFC2136] and
   sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 of [RFC4592].

3.2.  Updates to RFC2308

   The second paragraph of section 5 of [RFC2308] states the following:
   "A negative answer that resulted from a name error (NXDOMAIN) should
   be cached such that it can be retrieved and returned in response to
   another query for the same <QNAME, QCLASS> that resulted in the
   cached negative response."

   This document revises that paragraph to the following: "A negative
   answer that resulted from a name error (NXDOMAIN) should be cached
   such that it can be retrieved and returned in response to another
   query for the same <QNAME, QCLASS> that resulted in the cached
   negative response, or where QNAME is a descendant of the original
   QNAME, and QCLASS is the same."

   The above section Section 2 elaborates on the revised rule and
   specifies when it may be reasonable to relax or ignore it.

4.  Benefits

   The main benefit is a better efficiency of the caches.  In the
   example above, the resolver sends only one query instead of two, the
   second one being answered from the cache.  This will benefit the
   entire DNS ecosystem, since the authoritative name servers will have
   less unnecessary traffic to process.

   The correct behavior (in [RFC1034] and made clearer in this document)
   is specially useful when combined with QNAME minimisation [RFC7816]
   since it will allow a resolver to stop searching as soon as an
   NXDOMAIN is encountered.

   "NXDOMAIN cut" may also help mitigate certain types of random QNAME
   attacks [joost-dnsterror] [balakrichenan-dafa888], where there is a
   fixed suffix which does not exist.  In these attacks against the



Bortzmeyer & Huque       Expires March 22, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                NXDOMAIN cut                September 2016


   authoritative name server, queries are sent to resolvers for a QNAME
   composed of a fixed suffix ("dafa888.wf" in one of the articles
   above), which is typically nonexistent, and a random prefix,
   different for each request.  A resolver receiving these requests have
   to forward them to the authoritative servers.  With "NXDOMAIN cut", a
   system administrator would just have to send to the resolver a query
   for the fixed suffix, the resolver would get a NXDOMAIN and then
   would stop forwarding the queries.  (It would be better if the SOA
   record in the NXDOMAIN response were sufficient to find the non-
   existing domain but it is not the case, see Appendix A.)

5.  Possible issues

   Let's assume the TLD example exists but foobar.example is not
   delegated (so the example's name servers will reply NXDOMAIN for a
   query about anything.foobar.example).  A system administrator decides
   to name the internal machines of his organization under
   office.foobar.example and uses a trick of his resolver to forward
   requests about this zone to his local authoritative name servers.
   "NXDOMAIN cut" would create problems here, since, depending on the
   order of requests to the resolver, it may have cached the non-
   existence from example and therefore "deleted" everything under.
   This document assumes that such setup is rare and does not need to be
   supported.

   Another issue that may happen: today, we see broken authoritative
   name servers which reply to ENT ([RFC7719], section 6) with NXDOMAIN
   instead of the normal NODATA ([RFC7719], section 3).

   RFC-EDITOR: REMOVE THE PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLICATION.  An example
   today is mta2._domainkey.cbs.nl (which exists) where querying
   _domainkey.cbs.nl yields NXDOMAIN.  Another example is www.upenn.edu,
   redirected to www.upenn.edu-dscg.edgesuite.net while a query for edu-
   dscg.edgesuite.net returns NXDOMAIN.

   Such name servers are definitely wrong and have always been.  Their
   behaviour is incompatible with DNSSEC.  Given the advantages of
   "NXDOMAIN cut", there is little reason to support this behavior.

6.  Implementation considerations

   This section is non-normative, and is composed only of various things
   which may be useful for implementors.  A recursive resolver may
   implement its cache in many ways.  The most obvious one is a tree
   data structure, because it fits the data model of domain names.  But,
   in practice, other implementations are possible, as well as various
   optimisations (such as a tree, augmented by an index of some common
   domain names).

Internet-Draft                NXDOMAIN cut                September 2016


   If a resolver implements its cache as a tree (without any
   optimisation), one way to follow the rules of Section 2 is, when
   receiving the NXDOMAIN, to prune the subtree of positive cache
   entries at that node, or to delete all individual cache entries for
   names below that node.  Then, when searching downward in its cache,
   this iterative caching DNS resolver will stop searching if it
   encounters a cached non-existence.

   Some resolver may have a cache which is NOT organized as a tree (but,
   for instance, as a dictionary) and therefore have a reason to ignore
   the rules of Section 2.  So these rules are a SHOULD and not a MUST.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   The technique described here may help against a denial-of-service
   attack named "random qnames" and described in Section 4.

   If a resolver does not validate the answers with DNSSEC, or if the
   zone is not signed, the resolver can of course be poisoned with a
   false NXDOMAIN, thus "deleting" a part of the domain name tree.  This
   denial-of-service attack is already possible without the rules of
   this document (but "NXDOMAIN cut" may increase its effects).  The
   only solution is to use DNSSEC.

9.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.

   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   As of today, practically all existing DNS resolvers are conservative
   by default: they consider a NXDOMAIN as only significant for the
   denied name itself, not for the names under.  Almost all the current
   recursive servers will send upstream a query for out-of-cache
   sub.example.com even if their cache contains an NXDOMAIN for
   example.com.

   There are a few exceptions.  The Unbound resolver has a configuration
   parameter called "harden-below-nxdomain" [2], which if set to "yes"
   turns on "NXDOMAIN cut" behavior ("only DNSSEC-secure nxdomains are
   used", see Section 8).  The PowerDNS recursor has optional partial
   support for "NXDOMAIN cut", for the root domain only, with its "root-
   nx-trust" setting, described as [3] "If set, an NXDOMAIN from the
   root-servers will serve as a blanket NXDOMAIN for the entire TLD the
   query belonged to.  The effect of this is far fewer queries to the
   root-servers.".

Appendix A.  Why can't we just use the owner name of the returned SOA?

   In this document, we deduce the non-existence of a domain only for
   NXDOMAIN answers where the denied name was the exact domain.  If a
   resolver sends a query to the name servers of the TLD example, asking
   for the MX record for www.foobar.example, and subsequently receives a
   NXDOMAIN, it can only register the fact that www.foobar.example (and
   everything underneath) does not exist.  This is true regardless if
   the accompanying SOA record is for the domain example only.  One
   cannot infer that foobar.example is nonexistent.  The accompanying
   SOA record indicates the apex of the zone, not the closest existing
   domain name.  So, using the owner name of the SOA record in the
   Authoritative section to deduce "NXDOMAIN cuts" is currently
   definitely not OK.

   RFC-EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: to use a real example today,
   ask the authoritative name servers of the TLD fr about
   anything.which.does.not.exist.gouv.fr.  The SOA will indicate fr (the
   apex) even while gouv.fr does exist (there is no zone cut between
   gouv.fr and fr).

   Deducing the non-existence of a node from the SOA in the NXDOMAIN
   reply may certainly help with random qnames attacks but this is out-
   of-scope for this document.  It would require to address the problems
   mentioned in the first paragraph of this section.  A possible
   solution would be, when receiving a NXDOMAIN with a SOA which is more
   than one label up in the tree, to send requests for the domains which
   are between the QNAME and the owner name of the SOA.  (A resolver

   which does DNSSEC validation or QNAME minimisation will need to do
   it, anyway.)

Appendix B.  Related approaches

   The document [I-D.ietf-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse] describes another
   way to address some of the same concerns (decreasing the traffic for
   non-existing domain names).  Unlike "NXDOMAIN cut", it requires
   DNSSEC but it is more powerful since it can synthesize NXDOMAINs for
   domains that were not queried.
