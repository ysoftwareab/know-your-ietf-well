                BGP Extended Community Registries Update
                 draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ext-com-registry-05

Abstract

   This document updates several BGP Extended Community registries in
   order to replace the "Experimental Use" registration procedure in
   some entries, since their use is clearly not experimental and thus
   misleading.

   This document updates RFC7153 and RFC8955.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7153] reorganizes the IANA registries for the type values and
   sub-type values of the BGP Extended Communities attribute.  As a
   result the IANA maintained registry entitled "BGP Transitive Extended
   Community Types" includes a range of Type Values (0x80-0x8F) reserved
   for Experimental Use. Out of this experimental range the types 0x80,
   0x81, 0x82 have been used in [RFC5575] and [RFC7674] (both documents
   rendered Obsolete by [RFC8955]).  The primary use for those types and
   sub-type registries is non experimental.

   Section 2 of this document requests the registry cleanup to reflect
   the actual use of those code-points (removing "Experimental Use" from
   the sub-type registry names) and changes the registration procedure
   of the types 0x80, 0x81, 0x82 to use the First Come First Served
   policy [RFC8126] and thus updates [RFC7153] and [RFC8955].

Internet-Draft       BGP Ext. Com. Registries Update       December 2021


2.1.  Registry: BGP Transitive Extended Community Types

   IANA maintains a registry entitled "BGP Transitive Extended Community
   Types".  IANA is requested to add [this document] to the Reference of
   this registry, update the Name of the Type Values according to
   Table 1 and append a reference to [this document] to the existing
   references.

   +=======+==============================================+===========+
   | Type  | Name                                         | Reference |
   | Value |                                              |           |
   +=======+==============================================+===========+
   | 0x80  | Generic Transitive Extended Community (Sub-  | [add this |
   |       | Types are defined in the "Generic Transitive | document] |
   |       | Extended Community Sub-Types" registry)      |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0x81  | Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 2 | [add this |
   |       | (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic       | document] |
   |       | Transitive Extended Community Part 2 Sub-    |           |
   |       | Types" registry)                             |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0x82  | Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 3 | [add this |
   |       | (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic       | document] |
   |       | Transitive Extended Community Part 3 Sub-    |           |
   |       | Types" registry)                             |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+

        Table 1: Registry: BGP Transitive Extended Community Types

   Furthermore IANA is requested to change the registration procedures
   of this registry of Type Values 0x80 thru 0x82 to First Come First
   Served [RFC8126].  The resulting Registration Procedures should read
   as in Table 2.

       +===========+===============================================+
       | Range     | Registration Procedures                       |
       +===========+===============================================+
       | 0x00-0x3f | First Come First Served                       |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x80-0x82 | First Come First Served (see [this document]) |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x83-0x8f | Reserved for Experimental Use (see [RFC3692]) |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x90-0xbf | Standards Action                              |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
