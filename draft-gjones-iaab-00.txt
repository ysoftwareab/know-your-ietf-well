Internet-draft I.A.A.B.(Internet Address Access or Block)  November 2003

1. Introduction

   This memo introduces a simple and easier way of controlling material
   by utilizing groups of similar content.  By utilizing "IDP" and "CRX"
   Identifier and Cross Referencing Positions, we can identify the
   business or user's IP address and telephone number.(Data, Video,
   Voice over IP, whether POTS or wireless communications is used).
   Secondly, this memo will provide a way of declaring by way of
   documented content what is the declared business intent.  And lastly,
   this memo will provide a way to monitor and investigate chat rooms,
   and online messaging services.

  1.1  Terminology and Syntax conventions plans

  In this document the following new terms are also defined:

   "CIP"
   The "Content Identifier Positions" will be designated like alphanumeric
   characters, including ANSI, ASCII, HTML, DOS, Katakana, and all other
   language character types available worldwide.
   "IPv4 + 2"
   "IPv6 + 2"

   The + 2 of the Internet Protocol versions 4 or 6 is the Content
   Identifier positions "CIP".  These 2 (two) positions will be the first
   alphanumeric characters before the IP Address.
   "IDP" Identifier Position
   "CRX" Cross Reference Position

    The first position of the CIP will be the IDP, identifier position.
    The identifier position will be designated by IANA, ISO, and IESG.
    This character in the left-most position will be the PRIMARY routing
    designate, and will be PERMANENT and not modified except by the
    IANA, ISO, and IESG, OR SO DESIGNATED AUTHORITY unless re-register
    occurs.

   "X" = Any alphanumeric characters, including ANSI, ASCII, HTML, DOS,
   Katakana, and all other language character types available worldwide.
   Also, "X", can also mean, do not care. (Position character filler)

   "IDP"Identifier Positions +2 = "1X,  2X, 3X, 4X, ETC."
   "CRX" CROSS REFERENCE Capable Position + 2 = X1, X2, X3, X4, ETC..."
   The same "IDP", "CRX" designations must be used for Data, Video,
   Voice over IP, whether POTS or wireless communications is used.

Internet-draft I.A.A.B.(Internet Address Access or Block)  November 2003


   IDENTIFIER POSITIONS EXAMPLES 2 digit types IPv4 + 2

   1X - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX  OR
      	1X.XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
     CRX 11 - XXX-XXX-XXXX voice/ data/ video over IP, including POTS,
     and wireless
   2X - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX  OR
      	2X.XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
     CRX 21 - XXX-XXX-XXXX voice/data/video over IP, including POTS,
     and wireless.

   IDENTIFIER POSITIONS EXAMPLES 2digit types IPv6 + 2

   1X - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.175.200.100.10  OR
      	1X.XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.175.200.100.10
     CRX 11 - XXX-XXX-XXXX voice/data/video over IP, including POTS,
     and wireless
   2X - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.173.101.100.10  OR
      	2X.XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.175.200.100.10
     CRX 21 - XXX-XXX-XXXX voice/data/video over IP, including POTS,
     and wireless

1.2.  Groups of similar content overview
   By grouping businesses, governments, countries, ISP's, etc... and
   even users, we can effectively filter routing decisions quickly,
   and block or ignore unwanted material. With this convention, "CIP",
   you will reduce cumbersome routing tables and memory or disk space
   required for routing and firewall decisions.  We the people must take
   control of what we want to see, are especially, what our children
   will or will not see until they reach the age of consent.
   (Legal Adult or Voting Age).  We already in place, have constraints
   in the motion picture industry, television, radio, and video/audio
   media arenas.  The internet is next (NOW) and telecommunications.
   Examples, to date = DO NOT CALL, CALL BLOCK etc..

1.3. Groups of similar content EXAMPLES (First Position)
	a. 1X = Pornographic material(Explicit Rated X)
	b. 2X = Adult Material(Rated R)
	c. 3X = Parental Guidance (Mature material)
	d. 4X = Business Spamming with any of the above (1X, 2X, 3X)
		Attachments, and pop-ups.
	e. 5X = STOCK EXCHANGE-BANKING
	f. 6X = GOVERNMENTS/COUNTRIES
	g. 7X = CORPORATE BUSINESSES
	h. 8X = INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER
	 Etc. Etc., Etc.

Internet-draft I.A.A.B.(Internet Address Access or Block)  November 2003


1.4. Groups of similar content EXAMPLES (Second Position)
	The second position X1, X2, Etc.. and any other character can be
	designated by the owner except so designated for IANA, ISO, and
	IESG, or so DESIGNATED Authority for specific functions.
	(Example = CHAT ROOMS and "CRX")

	EXAMPLES
	1.8X = Internet Service Provider
		a. 85 = Internet Service Provider - Chat room
	2.6X = Governments/Countries
		a. 62 = Military
		b. 63 = State government
		c. 64 = Etc. Etc., Etc.
	3.1X = Pornographic material(Explicit Rated X)
		a. 11 =  CRX Cross Reference telecommunications.
		(POTS,or,wireless)
		b. 15 = Pornographic material(Explicit Rated X)
		(Chat Room)

  	The above are examples only, but functional ideas.

2. Internet Address Access or Block (I.A.A.B)
	With the existing scheme, we have by means of using the existing
	command	structure,i.e. (config)#access-list ? (Requires a large
	amount of memory, and disk space).
	OR
   2.1	creating a simpler command structure to acomplish the same thing
	by creating "CIP" command structured access-list groups
	(config)#access-list IDP group ?
	(config)#access-list CRX group ?
  NEW -	<00>		Identifier Positions list(list above pg.4)
  NEW -	<01>		CRX Cross Reference Telecommunications
	<1-99>		IP standard access list
	<100-199>	IP extended access list

	EXAMPLE "CIP" for IDP and CRX conventions

			EXAMPLE IP V4 + 2
	(config)#access-list 00 deny 1X.XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX 0.0.0.0
	(config)#access-list 01 deny 11.XXX-XXX-XXXX
	(config)#access-list 00 deny 2X.XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX 0.0.0.0

	IDENTIFIERS EXAMPLES: All of the rest of the Identifiers can be
as designated as required.(IPv4 and 6)

E. 50 083.110.239.010 ==== STOCK EXCHANGE-BANKING
       50 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.083.110.239.010 ==== STOCK EXCHANGE-BANKING

G. 70 163.221.211.010 ==== CORPORATE BUSINESSES Etc.
       70 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.163.221.211.010 ==== CORPORATE BUSINESSES Etc.
H. 80 063.110.239.010 ==== INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER
       80 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.063.110.239.010 ==== INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER

THE IDENTIFIER POSITIONS "IDP",and "CRX" WILL NOT, OR CANNOT BE PART OF
OR CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE IP ADDRESS OR ANY SUBNETTING SCHEME.

    2.3  Special identification (CHAT ROOMS)

	  85  XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.063.110.239.010 ==== INTERNET SERVICE
	PROVIDER
The second digit will identify chat rooms or messaging services. After
establishing their connection, we can query users
(source/destination address) history. (Porn/adult site user,
example == (FLAG))
Flagged will be monitored for content looking for words like i.e.
(meet me, will be, IÆll be at, etc..)

.
2.5 IANA, ISO, and IESG Rules, or so designated authority
	All IP addresses WILL be registered by DECLARATION DOCUMENT.
  (Signed and notarized/authorization?)

2.6 Declared business intent.
      We will have all business's and certain groups or users, declare
      what they "send", or "transmit" via the internet or by telecom.
      to users.(Individual Rights (do not call, call block, reception 
denied,
      no access))

2.7 Penalties for non compliance
   1. Warning = 1st offence (Official document of Warning, and possible
   	requirement to confirm "sender", of the offense, or disable
   	sender address until resign-on, and acknowledgement of the
   	offense, or a telephone call confirmation.
   2. Fines = 2nd offense $ XXXX.00
   3. Disable site = 3rd offense 30 days plus fines and criminal
   investigation/prosecution etc...
   4. Disconnect = 3rd offense 1 year and give ip address
   (website and connection), plus fines and criminal prosecution etc.

YOU CAN NOT CHANGE YOUR IDENTIFIER UNLESS YOU CHANGE YOUR DECLARATION
DOCUMENT.

3. Conclusion

   This proposal will create a standard for registering IP addresses
   within the global IP address transport system.  The proposal can be
   consistent with existing IP address standards.
   (IP V4 +2, and IP V6 +2)
	A.Our primary concern is Primary and Secondary Education Sites,
	and Libraries (DO NOT ACCESS SITES 1X, 2X, 3X, (4X monitored)).
	B.If necessary, Library's should have an Adult Room for
	internet accessing adult sites, if available.
	(Picture ID Required)(First Amendment Rights)

4. References Section
	None Known Reference
	Created examples utilizing Cisco IOS, Access-List
	(I.A.A.B) reference (2.1 above).

5. Security Considerations
   This document specifies a means by which IP addresses and sites can
   be filtered by content. Since routing can be determined by Identifier
   position, you will reduce the amount of memory and storage needed for
   large Access lists.
   Plus, with the 2(second position) available for certain sites,
   (i.e. US Armed Forces, Government, Corporate, etc..) gives an
   additional 1st (First) Level of security, or monitoring capable.
