                Routing Timer Parameter Synchronization
              draft-ietf-rtgwg-routing-timer-param-sync-00

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for a link state routing protocol
   to coordinate the value of a routing timer parameter amongst routers
   in the flooding domain.  The document also defines the solution to
   one specific case: the agreement of a common convergence timer value
   for use by routers in network convergence.

1.  Introduction

   There exist use cases where it desirable for a network to use a
   common value for a routing timer parameter across all nodes.  In the
   past, these types of use case have been addressed by setting the
   parameter to a constant value in the protocol definition itself, or
   by requiring that the same value of the parameter be configured at
   every node.

   Setting the routing timer parameter to a constant value in the
   protocol definition makes it difficult to change the parameter, since
   a change would require formal modification to the protocol.  In
   practice, such a change is impractical, so the constant value needs
   to be chosen conservatively.  This may impose a fundamental
   restriction on the eventual use of the protocol.

   Manual or "static" configuration of the timer parameter is fraught
   for two reasons.  First, it is can be difficult to ensure that the
   correct, identical, value is installed in all of the routers.
   Second, if any change is introduced into the network that results in
   a need to change the value (for example due to a change in hardware
   or software version) then all of the routers need to be reconfigured



Bryant, et al.             Expires May 1, 2018                  [Page 2]

   to use the new timer parameter value.  Such consistency may be
   ensured by deploying automated means such as enforcing the new value
   by invoking the management interface of all involved routers.  For
   example, a central management entity may be responsible for
   communicating the new configuration value by means of vendor-specific
   command line interface (CLI), NETCONF[RFC6241], etc.  This approach
   may be attractive if all involved nodes expose technology-agnostic
   and vendor-independent interfaces to modify a given network-wide
   configuration parameter.

   This document describes a protocol extension that propagates a
   routing timer parameter throughout the flooding domain, which can be
   used as an alternative to the centralized approach described above.
   The method of choosing between one or more different advertised
   values, the flooding scope, and the action to be taken when the
   parameter changes MUST be provided in the definition of the parameter
   type.

   This document also creates one parameter type: Convergence Timer
   intended for use in IP Fast-reroute applications [RFC5714] [RFC5715].

   Note that this protocol is only intended to be used for the
   propagation of parameters needed to support the operation of the
   routing system.  It MUST NOT be used as a general purpose parameter
   exchange protocol, and in particular it MUST NOT be used as a
   parameter negotiation protocol, since such use may degrade the
   ability of the underlying link-state routing protocol to carry our
   its essential purpose.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Overview of Mechanism

   Routing Timer parameter values that can be disseminated by means of
   the attribute defined in this specification MUST be defined as a
   configurable parameter or a default parameter in the corresponding
   specification.

   A new information element is introduced into the routing protocol
   that specifies the parameter.  Each router taking part in the
   parameter synchronization is expected to advertise a specific value
   of the parameter, which that router determines based mainly on
   considerations local to that router.  In general, different routers
   in the flooding domain may advertise different values of the



Bryant, et al.             Expires May 1, 2018                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        Routing Timer Parameter Sync          October 2017


   parameter.  How the values advertised by a router are determined is
   out of scope of this document.

   A router receiving the parameter values advertised by all routers in
   the flooding domain will use a well-defined method to select the
   operational value of the parameter that it uses in the running of the
   protocol.  All routers MUST use the same method applied to the same
   set of advertised parameter values.  All routers SHALL therefore
   choose the same operational value for the parameter.

   Note the operational value for the parameter selected SHOULD NOT
   directly affect the value for the parameter advertised by a router,
   since this introduces a form of negotiation leading to additional
   routing protocol traffic and possibly to instability in the routing
   protocol.

   The method of selecting from a range of advertised parameter values
   MUST be provided in the parameter definition.

   The definition of the parameter MUST specify the action to be taken
   when a new parameter value is advertised that would cause a change in
   the selected value.

   The definition of the parameter MUST specify the action to be taken
   in the legacy/migration case, where not all routers advertise the
   parameter.

4.  Protocol Details

   This section describes the protocol extensions needed to implement
   this functionality.

4.1.  ISIS

   A new Routing Timer Parameter Synchronization (RTPS) sub-TLV is
   introduced into the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV (TLV #242 defined in
   [RFC7981]).  The setting of the S-bit in TLV #242 (indicating whether
   the parameter should be leaked between levels) MUST be included in
   the specific routing parameter definition.

4.2.  OSPF

   A new Routing Timer Parameter Synchronization TLV is defined for the
   OSPF Router Information LSA.  This new TLV may be carried in a type
   10 or type 11 OSPF Opaque LSA depending on the required flooding
   scope.
   The specification of a the specific routing timer parameter MUST

   Duration is a 32 bit value representing is the length of the timer in
   milliseconds.  This is capable of expressing a time in the range 1ms
   to just under 50 days.

5.  Convergence Time

   Routers running a fast-reroute mechanism such as Maximally Redundant
   Tree (MRT) [RFC7812] fast re-route require a network wide convergence
   time value so that know how long they need continue using the repair
   path before it is safe to use the base path.  This time is set to be
   the worst case time that any router will take to calculate the new
   topology, and to make the necessary changes to the FIB.

   The time taken by a router to complete each phase of the transition
   will be dependent on the size of the network and the design and
   implementation of the router.  It can therefore be expected that the
   optimum delay will need to be tuned from time to time as the network
   evolves.

5.1.  Required Properties

   The Convergence Time mechanism MUST have the following properties:

   o The operational convergence delay time MUST be consistent among
     all routers that are converging on the new topology.

   o The operational convergence delay time MUST be the highest delay
     time advertised by any router in the new topology.

   o The mechanism MUST increase the delay when a new router in
     introduced to the network that requires a higher delay than
     is currently in use.

   o When the router that had the longest delay requirements is
     removed from the topology, the convergence delay timer
     value MUST, within some reasonable time, be reduced to
     the longest delay required by the remaining routers.

   o It MUST be possible for a router to change the
     convergence delay timer value that it requires.

   o A router which is in multiple routing areas, or is running
     multiple routing protocols MAY signal a different loop-free
     convergence delay for each area.

   How a router determines the time that it needs to execute each
   convergence phase is an implementation issue, and outside the scope
   of this specification.  However a router that dynamically determines



Bryant, et al.             Expires May 1, 2018                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Routing Timer Parameter Sync          October 2017


   its proposed delay value must do so in such a way that it does not
   cause the synchronized value to continually fluctuate.

5.2.  Definition of the Convergence Timer

   It is RECOMMENDED that the routing convergence timer be limited to a
   maximum of 60 seconds.

   The routing convergence timer value selected is the largest value
   advertised.

   If a routing protocol message is issued that changes the Convergence
   Timer value, but does not change the topology, the new timer value
   MUST be taken into consideration during the next network transition,
   but MUST NOT instigate a new transition.

   If a routing protocol message is issued that changes both the
   Convergence Timer value and the topology, a transition is instigated
   and the new timer value MUST be taken into consideration.

   The convergence mechanism MUST specify the action to be taken if a
   timer change (only) message and a topology change message are
   independently generated during the hold-off time.

   A router running ISIS that supports convergence timer synchronization
   SHOULD advertise the Routing Timer Parameter Synchronization sub-TLV
   with the value of the Convergence Timer in the Duration field of this
   sub-TLV.  The S-bit is set to zero indicating that the Convergence
   Timer RPTS sub-TLV MUST NOT be leaked between levels.

   A router running OSPF that supports convergence timer synchronization
   SHOULD advertise the Routing Timer Parameter Synchronization TLV
   with the value of the Convergence Timer in the Duration field of this
   TLV.  The TLV SHOULD only be carried in the type 10 Opaque LSA which
   prevents propagation outside the OSPF area.

6.  IANA considerations

6.1.  ISIS

   IANA is requested to allocate a new Sub-TLVs for TLV 242 from the IS-
   IS TLV Codepoints name space.

6.2.  OSPF

   IANA is requested to allocate a new OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV

   A value in the range 12 to 32767 is requested.

6.3.  Routing Timer Parameter Synchronization Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new Routing Timer Parameter
   Synchronization Registry within its own name space, and to allocate
   one value from it.

   Value        Name                      Reference

   1            Convergence Timer         This document
   2..255       Reserved                  This document

   Allocations within this registry require IETF Consensus.  This link
   state protocol extension MUST NOT be used for any purpose other than
   one associated with the routing system timer parameters.

7.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of this parameter advertising mechanism does not
   introduce a significant vulnerability into the base routing protocol
   and is secured in exactly the same way as the other TLVs that are
   carried.

   In specifying a new parameter, consideration must be given to the
   impact of the additional parameter, and in particular the rate of
   change of that parameter, on the dynamics of the link-state routing
   protocol in use.  In the specific case of the Convergence Timer, the
   amount of data being carried and the rate of change of the parameter
   value will have a negligible impact on the link-state routing
   protocol in use.

   A rouge router deliberately introducing an anomalous parameter value
   is just as capable of introducing many other anomalies into the
   routing domain.





Bryant, et al.             Expires May 1, 2018                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Routing Timer Parameter Sync          October 2017


   As far as possible, care should be taken to validate that the
   parameter is reasonable.

   In the specific case of the Convergence Time RTPS, the following
   considerations apply.

   If an abnormally large timer value is proposed by a router, the there
   is a danger that the convergence process will take an excessive time.
   If during that time the routing protocol signals the need for another
   transition, the transition will be abandoned and the default best
   case (traditional) convergence mechanism used.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations prohibit the configuration of
   a router convergence timer value in excess of 60 seconds.
