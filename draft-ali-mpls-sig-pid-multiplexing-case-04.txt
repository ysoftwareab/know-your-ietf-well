   Abstract 

      There are many deployment scenarios where an RSVP-TE LSP carries 
      multiple payloads. In these cases, it gets ambiguous on what 
      should value should be carried as L3PID in the Label Request 
      Object [RFC3209] or G-PID in the Generalized Label Request Object 
      [RFC3471], [RFC3473]. The document proposes use of some dedicated 
      PID values to cover some typical cases of multiple payloads 
      carried by the LSP.

   1. Introduction 

      When an RSVP-TE LSP is used to carry multiple payload type (e.g., 
      IPv6 and IPv4 payloads on the same LSP), it gets ambiguous on 
      what value should be carried as L3PID in the Label Request Object 
      [RFC3209] or G-PID in the Generalized Label Request Object 
      [RFC3471], [RFC3473]. It also gets unclear at the receiver that 
      source may be multiplexing multiple payloads on the same RSVP-TE 
      LSP. The document clarifies some of the use cases where RSVP-TE 
      LSP is used to carry multiple payloads and what PID should be 
      used during signaling.

   2. Some use cases 

      This section outlines some used cases.   

   2.1. PID = 0x0800 (IPv4 Payload) 

      This case is optimized for carrying IPv4 payload such that IPv4 
      packets travel without need for any additional information 
      (label) to identify the payload, i.e., IPv4 payload is identified 
      by the signaling. If multiplexing of additional payloads is 
      desired, some in-band data plane mechanisms are needed to 
      identify the payload. E.g., if IPv4 and IPv6 payloads are 
      multiplexed on the same tunnel, an IPv6 Explicit Null Label or 
      some other application label is used to identify IPv6 payload.  

   2.2. PID = 0x86DD (IPv6 Payload) 

      This case is optimized for carrying IPv6 payload such that IPv6 
      packets travel without need for any additional information 
      (label) to identify the payload, i.e., IPv6 payload is identified 
      by the signaling. If multiplexing of additional payloads is 
      desired, some in-band data plane mechanisms are needed to 
      identify the payload. E.g., if IPv4 and IPv6 payloads are 
      multiplexed on the same tunnel, an IPv4 Explicit Null Label or 
      some other application label is used to identify IPv4 payload.  

   2.3. Ignore PID 

      This case is the case where payload to be carried by the LSP is 
      not known to the Ingress node. Payload identification is obtained 
      via some means other than signaling and egress node ignores the 
      signaled PID. This case is addressed by [OOB-MAPPING].  

   3. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any new security issues above 
      those identified in [RFC3209], [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].
