                          Extended DNS Errors
                   draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error-13

Abstract

   This document defines an extensible method to return additional
   information about the cause of DNS errors.  Though created primarily
   to extend SERVFAIL to provide additional information about the cause
   of DNS and DNSSEC failures, the Extended DNS Errors option defined in
   this document allows all response types to contain extended error
   information.  Extended DNS Error information does not change the
   processing of RCODEs.

1.  Introduction and background

   There are many reasons that a DNS query may fail, some of them
   transient, some permanent; some can be resolved by querying another
   server, some are likely best handled by stopping resolution.
   Unfortunately, the error signals that a DNS server can return are
   very limited, and are not very expressive.  This means that
   applications and resolvers often have to "guess" at what the issue is
   - e.g. was the answer marked REFUSED because of a lame delegation, or
   because the nameserver is still starting up and loading zones?  Is a
   SERVFAIL a DNSSEC validation issue, or is the nameserver experiencing
   some other failure?  What error messages should be presented to the
   user or logged under these conditions?

   A good example of issues that would benefit by additional error
   information are errors caused by DNSSEC validation issues.  When a
   stub resolver queries a name which is DNSSEC bogus (using a
   validating resolver), the stub resolver receives only a SERVFAIL in
   response.  Unfortunately, the SERVFAIL Response Code (RCODE) is used
   to signal many sorts of DNS errors, and so the stub resolvers only
   option is to ask the next configured DNS resolver.  The result of
   trying the next resolver is one of two outcomes: either the next
   resolver also validates, and a SERVFAIL is returned again or the next
   resolver is not a validating resolver, and the user is returned a
   potentially harmful result.  With an Extended DNS Error (EDE) option
   enclosed in the response message, the resolver is able to return a
   more descriptive reason as to why any failures happened, or add
   additional context to a message containing a NOERROR RCODE.

   This document specifies a mechanism to extend DNS errors to provide
   additional information about the cause of an error.  These extended
   DNS error codes described in this document and can be used by any
   system that sends DNS queries and receives a response containing an
   EDE option.  Different codes are useful in different circumstances,
   and thus different systems (stub resolvers, recursive resolvers, and
   authoritative resolvers) might receive and use them.

   This document does not allow or prohibit any particular extended
   error codes and information to be matched with any particular RCODEs.
   Some combinations of extended error codes and RCODEs may seem
   nonsensical (such as resolver-specific extended error codes in
   responses from authoritative servers), so systems interpreting the

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error       December 2019


   extended error codes MUST NOT assume that a combination will make
   sense.  Receivers MUST be able to accept EDE codes and EXTRA-TEXT in
   all messages, including those with a NOERROR RCODE.  Applications
   MUST continue to follow requirements from applicable specs on how to
   process RCODEs no matter what EDE values is also received.  Senders
   MAY include more than one EDE option and receivers MUST be able to
   accept (but not necessarily process or act on) multiple EDE options
   in a DNS message.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Extended DNS Error EDNS0 option format

   This draft uses an EDNS0 ([RFC6891]) option to include Extended DNS
   Error (EDE) information in DNS messages.  The option is structured as
   follows:

                                                1   1   1   1   1   1
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   0: |                            OPTION-CODE                        |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   2: |                           OPTION-LENGTH                       |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   4: | INFO-CODE                                                     |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   6: / EXTRA-TEXT ...                                                /
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Field definition details:

   o  OPTION-CODE, 2-octets/16-bits (defined in [RFC6891]]), for EDE is
      TBD.  [RFC Editor: change TBD to the proper code once assigned by
      IANA.]
   o  OPTION-LENGTH, 2-octets/16-bits ((defined in [RFC6891]]) contains
      the length of the payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in
      octets and should be 2 plus the length of the EXTRA-TEXT field
      (which may be a zero-length string).
   o  INFO-CODE, 16-bits, which is the principal contribution of this
      document.  This 16-bit value, encoded in network (MSB) byte order,
      provides the additional context for the RESPONSE-CODE of the DNS
      message.  The INFO-CODE serves as an index into the "Extended DNS
      Errors" registry Section 5.1.

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error       December 2019


   o  EXTRA-TEXT, a variable length, UTF-8 encoded, text field that may
      hold additional textual information.  Note: EXTRA-TEXT may be zero
      octets in length, indicating there is no EXTRA-TEXT included.
      Care should be taken not to leak private information that an
      observer would not otherwise have access to, such as account
      numbers.

   The Extended DNS Error (EDE) option can be included in any response
   (SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, REFUSED, and even NOERROR, etc) to a query that
   includes OPT Pseudo-RR [RFC6891].  This document includes a set of
   initial codepoints (and requests to the IANA to add them to the
   registry), but is extensible via the IANA registry to allow
   additional error and information codes to be defined in the future.

3.  Extended DNS Error Processing

   When the response grows beyond the requestor's UDP payload size
   [RFC6891], servers SHOULD truncate messages by dropping EDE options
   before dropping other data from packets.  Implementations SHOULD set
   the truncation bit when dropping EDE options.

   When a resolver or forwarder receives an EDE option, whether or not
   (and how) to pass along EDE information on to their original client
   is implementation dependent.  Implementations MAY choose to not
   forward information, or they MAY choose to create a new EDE option(s)
   that conveys the information encoded in the received EDE.  When doing
   so, care should be taken to ensure any information is properly
   attributed since an EDNS0 option received by the original client will
   be perceived only to have come from the resolver or forwarder sending
   it.

4.  Defined Extended DNS Errors

   This document defines some initial EDE codes.  The mechanism is
   intended to be extensible, and additional code-points can be
   registered in the "Extended DNS Errors" registry Section 5.1.  The
   INFO-CODE from the EDE EDNS option is used to serve as an index into
   the "Extended DNS Error" IANA registry, the initial values for which
   are defined in the following sub-sections.

4.1.  Extended DNS Error Code 0 - Other

   The error in question falls into a category that does not match known
   extended error codes.  Implementations SHOULD include a EXTRA-TEXT
   value to augment this error code with additional information.

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error       December 2019


4.2.  Extended DNS Error Code 1 - Unsupported DNSKEY Algorithm

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but a DNSKEY
   RRSET contained only unsupported DNSSEC algorithms.

4.3.  Extended DNS Error Code 2 - Unsupported DS Digest Type

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but a DS RRSET
   contained only unsupported Digest Types.

4.4.  Extended DNS Error Code 3 - Stale Answer

   The resolver was unable to resolve answer within its time limits and
   decided to answer with previously cached data instead of answering
   with an error.  This is typically caused by problems communicating
   with an authoritative serever, possibly as result of a DoS attack
   against another network.

4.5.  Extended DNS Error Code 4 - Forged Answer

   For policy reasons (legal obligation, or malware filtering, for
   instance), an answer was forged.  Note that this should be used when
   an answer is still provided, not when failure codes are returned
   instead.  See Blocked(15), Censored (16), and Filtered (17) for use
   when returning other response codes.

4.6.  Extended DNS Error Code 5 - DNSSEC Indeterminate

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but validation
   ended in the Indeterminate state [RFC4035].

4.7.  Extended DNS Error Code 6 - DNSSEC Bogus

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but validation
   ended in the Bogus state.

4.8.  Extended DNS Error Code 7 - Signature Expired

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but no
   signatures are presently valid and some (often all) are expired.

4.9.  Extended DNS Error Code 8 - Signature Not Yet Valid

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but but no
   signatures are presently valid and at least some are not yet valid.

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error       December 2019


4.10.  Extended DNS Error Code 9 - DNSKEY Missing

   A DS record existed at a parent, but no supported matching DNSKEY
   record could be found for the child.

4.11.  Extended DNS Error Code 10 - RRSIGs Missing

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but no RRSIGs
   could be found for at least one RRset where RRSIGs were expected.

4.12.  Extended DNS Error Code 11 - No Zone Key Bit Set

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but no Zone Key
   Bit was set in a DNSKEY.

4.13.  Extended DNS Error Code 12 - NSEC Missing

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but the
   requested data was missing and a covering NSEC or NSEC3 was not
   provided.

4.14.  Extended DNS Error Code 13 - Cached Error

   The resolver is returning the SERVFAIL RCODE from its cache.

4.15.  Extended DNS Error Code 14 - Not Ready

   The server is unable to answer the query as it is not fully
   functional (yet).

4.16.  Extended DNS Error Code 15 - Blocked

   The server is unable to respond to the request because the domain is
   blacklisted due to an internal security policy imposed by the
   operator of the server being directly talked to.

4.17.  Extended DNS Error Code 16 - Censored

   The server is unable to respond to the request because the domain is
   blacklisted by a security policy imposed upon the server being talked
   to by an external requirement.  Note that how the imposed policy is
   applied is irrelevant (in-band DNS filtering, court order, etc).

4.18.  Extended DNS Error Code 17 - Filtered

   The server is unable to respond to the request because the domain is
   blacklisted as requested by the client.  Functionally, this amounts
   to "you requested that we filter domains like this one."

4.19.  Extended DNS Error Code 18 - Prohibited

   An authoritative or recursive resolver that receives a query from an
   "unauthorized" client can annotate its REFUSED message with this
   code.  Examples of "unauthorized" clients are recursive queries from
   IP addresses outside the network, blacklisted IP addresses, local
   policy, etc.

4.20.  Extended DNS Error Code 19 - Stale NXDOMAIN Answer

   The resolver was unable to resolve an answer within its configured
   time limits and decided to answer with a previously cached NXDOMAIN
   answer instead of answering with an error.  This is may be caused,
   for example, by problems communicating with an authoritative server,
   possibly as result of a DoS attack against another network.

4.21.  Extended DNS Error Code 20 - Not Authoritative

   An authoritative server that receives a query (with the RD bit clear,
   or when not configured for recursion) for a domain for which it is
   not authoritative SHOULD include this EDE code in the REFUSED
   response.  A resolver that receives a query (with the RD bit clear)
   SHOULD include this EDE code in the REFUSED response.

4.22.  Extended DNS Error Code 21 - Not Supported

   The requested operation or query is not supported as its use has been
   deprecated.

4.23.  Extended DNS Error Code 22 - No Reachable Authority

   The resolver could not reach any of the authoritative name servers
   (or they refused to reply).

4.24.  Extended DNS Error Code 23 - Network Error

   An unrecoverable error occurred while communicating with another
   server.

4.25.  Extended DNS Error Code 24 - Invalid Data

   An authoritative server that cannot answer with data for a zone it is
   otherwise configured to support.  This may occur because its most
   recent zone is too old, or has expired, for example.

6.  Security Considerations

   Though DNSSEC continues to be deployed, unfortunately a significant
   number of clients (~11% according to [GeoffValidation]) that receive
   a SERVFAIL from a validating resolver because of a DNSSEC validaion
   issue will simply ask the next (potentially non-validating) resolver
   in their list, and thus don't get any of the protections which DNSSEC
   should provide.

   This information is unauthenticated information, and an attacker (e.g
   a MITM or malicious recursive server) could insert an extended error
   response into already untrusted data -- ideally clients and resolvers
   would not trust any unauthenticated information, but until we live in
   an era where all DNS answers are authenticated via DNSSEC or other
   mechanisms [RFC2845] [RFC8094], there are some tradeoffs.  As an
   example, an attacker who is able to insert the DNSSEC Bogus Extended

   Error into a packet could instead simply reply with a fictitious
   address (A or AAAA) record.  Note that DNS Response Codes also
   contain no authentication and can be just as easily manipulated.

   of people over the years, but have forgotten who all they were -- if
   you were one of them, and are not listed, please let us know and
   we'll acknowledge you.

   One author also wants to thank the band "Infected Mushroom" for
   providing a good background soundtrack (and to see if he can get away
   with this in an RFC!)  Another author would like to thank the band
   "Mushroom Infectors".  This was funny at the time we wrote it, but we
   cannot remember why...
