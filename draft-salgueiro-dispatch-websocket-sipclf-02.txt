 Indicating WebSocket Protocol as a Transport in the Session Initiation
                 Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format (CLF)
              draft-salgueiro-dispatch-websocket-sipclf-02

Abstract

   RFC 7118 [RFC7118] specifies a WebSocket sub-protocol as a reliable
   real-time transport mechanism between SIP (Session Initiation
   Protocol) entities to enable usage of SIP in web-oriented
   deployments.  This document updates the SIP Common Log Format (CLF),
   defined in RFC 6873 [RFC6873], with a new "Transport Flag" for such
   SIP WebSocket transport.

1.  Introduction

   The WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] enables bi-directional message
   exchange between clients and servers on top of a persistent TCP
   connection (optionally secured with TLS [RFC5246]).  The initial
   protocol handshake makes use of HTTP [RFC7230] semantics, allowing
   the WebSocket protocol to reuse existing transport connections.

   RFC 7118 [RFC7118] defines a WebSocket sub-protocol for transporting
   SIP messages between a WebSocket client and server.

   SIP messages can be logged using the Common Log Format defined in RFC
   6873 [RFC6873].  In order to make such SIP CLF logging possible for
   SIP messages transported over the WebSocket protocol, a new WebSocket
   "Transport Flag" ('W') must be added to the "Transport Flags" already
   defined in RFC 6873 [RFC6873] (i.e., UDP, TCP and SCTP).

   This document updates RFC 6873 [RFC6873] by defining a new SIP CLF
   "Transport Flag" value for WebSocket.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Document Conventions

   This document contains several examples of SIP CLF records showing
   messages over plain and secure WebSocket connections.  The formatting
   described in this document does not permit the examples to be
   unambiguously rendered due to the constraints imposed by the
   formatting rules for RFCs.  To avoid ambiguity and to meet the RFC
   layout requirements, this document uses the <allOneLine/> markup
   convention established in [RFC4475].  This markup convention is
   described in detail in Section 3 of RFC 6873 [RFC6873] and used
   throughout that document for representing the syntax of SIP CLF
   records.

4.  Usage of the Websocket Transport Flag

   Section 4.2 of RFC6873 [RFC6873] specifies the mandatory fields in a
   SIP CLF record.  The fourth and fifth bytes of the five byte "Flags
   Field" are the "Transport Flag" and the "Encryption Flag"
   respectively.  SIP messages transported over both a plain and secure
   WebSocket connection can be clearly distinguished by appropriately
   setting these two flag fields.

   The currently registered values of the "Transport Flag" (Section 9.2
   of RFC 6873) are [UDP ('U'), TCP ('T'), and SCTP ('S')].  This
   document defines and registers a new "Transport Flag" value 'W' for
   WebSocket transport of SIP messages and consequently updates RFC 6873
   [RFC6873] and the IANA "SIP CLF Transport Flag Values" registry.

   SIP CLF records of messages transported over a plain WebSocket
   connection (WS) MUST set the "Transport Flag" to this new 'W' value
   and the "Encryption Flag" value to 'U' (Unencrypted).  SIP CLF
   records of messages transported over a secure WebSocket (WSS)
   connection (i.e.  WS over TLS) MUST set the "Transport Flag" to this
   new 'W' value and the "Encryption Flag" value to 'E' (Encrypted).

5.  Examples

   The following examples show sample SIP CLF records logged for SIP
   messages transported over both plain and secure WebSocket
   connections.

5.1.  SIP over WebSocket (WS)

   The following example represents a SIP INVITE request sent over a
   plain WebSocket connection.  For the sake of brevity, the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] body is omitted.

   Shown below is approximately how this message would appear as a

   entry has been split into five lines, instead of the two lines that
   actually appear in a log file; and the Tab characters have been
   padded out using spaces to simulate their appearance in a text
   terminal.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document merely adds a new "Transport Flag" value for the
   WebSocket protocol.  This value may be set in a SIP CLF record, but
   its use does not intrinsically introduce and new security
   considerations.  When logging protocol information, such as with SIP
   CLF, there are a myriad of security, privacy and data protection to
   consider.  These are exhaustively described in RFC 6872 [RFC6872] and
   RFC 6873 [RFC6873].

   Any security considerations specific to the WebSocket protocol or its
   application as a transport for SIP are detailed in the relevant
   specifications (the WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] and SIP over
   WebSockets [RFC7118]) and are considered outside the scope of this
   document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new value ('W') for SIP CLF "Transport Flag"
   and requests IANA to register this value in the registry titled "SIP
   CLF Transport Flag Values", as shown in Table 1 below.

             +-------+--------------------+------------------+
             | Value | Transport Protocol |    Reference     |
             +-------+--------------------+------------------+
             |   W   |     WebSocket      | RFC7118, RFCXXXX |
             +-------+--------------------+------------------+
