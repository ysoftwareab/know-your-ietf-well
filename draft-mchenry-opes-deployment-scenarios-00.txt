      1  Introduction 
          
         The rapid growth of the Internet and the increasing number of Internet users 
         have resulted in many scaling and growth problems with application designs 
         focused on operations at the ends (i.e. the client or the server). This has 
         led to a wide deployment of network edge caching proxies as a key strategy to 
         address these problems. These systems have been very successful in 
         accelerating Web content delivery and reducing the load on origin Web 
         servers.  
          
         However, the specific role of these network edge caching proxies as a gateway 
         between Web users and content providers suggests utilizing them for 
         intelligent services beyond simple caching. 
          
         There are already a variety of existing or proposed approaches that implement 
         particular services on top of a proxy platform. ICAP [5] extends the basic 
         idea of implementing value-added services on proxies by handling transport of 
         web objects between proxies and content modification servers, thus, enabling 
         remote call out mechanisms. EPSFW [2, 7] describes an extended framework to 
         provide general services on top of an open proxy platform. 
          
         This document discusses a number issues surrounding the deployment of edge 
         services. Specifically, it provides a discussion of use cases in which edge 
         services would be useful. It also examines the computational requirements for 
         various edge services and from that derives several actual configurations 
         that are anticipated for the deployment of edge services. These include both 
         the basic network topologies, as well as the domain issues surrounding the 
         deployments. Finally, it examines some issues relating to the use of rules 
         (or other policies) in the determination of which services are applicable to 
         a specific request or response.  
          
          
      2  Example Use Cases 
       
         In this section, several service examples possibly being implemented on top 
         of an open proxy platform as described in [2, 7]. Each of the following 
         service description consists of three subsections: a short abstract that 
         describes the service idea, a description of the underlying business model, 
         and finally a section that mentions technical challenges to be addressed when 
         implementing these services. 
          
         Subsection 1 describes virus scanning as an example service, which currently 
         is one of the most frequently cited service ideas. Subsections 2 and 3 
         describe services that dynamically assemble personalized content. These 
         services exhibit the use of the proxy device managing information about the 
         client. Subsections 4 and 5 present services that adapt content to the 
         capability of client devices and client access bandwidth. Some of the 
         previous service ideas can also be applied to streaming media, which is 
         discussed in Subsection 6. The services given in Subsections 7, 8, and 9 
         operate on client requests rather than on the content itself. More service 
         examples are given in Subsections 10 and 11.

      2.1  Virus Scanning 
          
         2.1.1 Abstract 
          
         Viruses, Trojan Horses, and worms have always posed a threat to Internet 
         users. Just recently we have seen a number of e-mail based worms that have 
         hit millions of Internet users worldwide within a few hours.  
          
         With the help of a content scanning and filtering system at the caching proxy 
         level, Web pages and also file transfers could be scanned for malicious 
         content prior to sending them to the user. In Web pages active content like 
         ActiveX, Java and JavaScript could be scanned for harmful code (e.g. code 
         exploiting security holes). File transfers could be scanned for known 
         viruses. If a virus is found, the adaptation server could try to remove it or 
         deny the delivery of the infected content. A general rule could be that the 
         caching proxy may store and/or deliver content only, if it has been scanned 
         by the content adaptation server and no viruses are found.  
          
         2.1.2 Business model 
          
         This service could be offered as an additional feature to ISP customers who 
         are concerned about security issues. Likewise enterprises could be interested 
         in this solution to prevent any malicious content from entering the company 
         network. 
          
         2.1.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         Web pages/files should be scanned for viruses by sending them to a separate 
         server where virus-scanning software would analyze them. ICAP [5] is an 
         example protocol for this purpose. The virus scanning operations should not 
         be performed on the caching proxy as they will probably affect the 
         performance of the caching proxy. 
          
         If HTTP file transfers are to be scanned for viruses and the requested file 
         cannot be found in the cache, we have to use a different approach than for 
         Web pages. It would not be feasible if the proxy waited for the requested 
         file to be received completely before sending it over to the content 
         adaptation server for the virus scan. This approach would lead to a long 
         delay at the user∆s end, which is not acceptable. Instead, we would have to 
         scan the file transfer continuously, as it is being sent to the user (similar 
         to streaming media). 
          
          
      2.2  Location-based Services 
          
         2.2.1 Abstract 
          
         If a content provider wants to add user-specific regional information 
         (weather forecasts for certain areas for example) to his Web pages, he has 
         little choice but to have the user select his location from a list of 
         regions. Usually it is not possible for origin servers to reliably detect 
         from where Web users connect to Web sites because user requests can get

         routed through a number of proxy servers on their way from the client to the 
         origin server.  
          
         In a network edge caching proxy environment user requests are usually 
         redirected to the nearest proxy that is available to respond to the request.  
         Regional information that is relevant to all users who are likely to connect 
         to a certain proxy could be stored at the corresponding caching proxy. 
         Whenever the proxy receives a user request, a module on the caching proxy 
         could insert the regional information into the requested Web page. If the Web 
         page does not contain any user-specific non-cacheable content other than the 
         inserted regional information, the Web page content can now be cached for 
         future requests. 
          
         2.2.2 Business model 
          
         This service could be sold to content providers who want to offer regional 
         information on their Web sites and want to accelerate the delivery of their 
         Web content. There are many cases in which a content provider could profit 
         from knowing the location of the user. Users could be targeted with regional 
         advertisement banners (see also ad insertion scenario). Regional distinctions 
         (e.g. sales taxes, differing laws etc.) could be taken into consideration 
         when the Web pages are prepared for the client. It would not be necessary any 
         more to ask the user for his location prior to presenting him relevant 
         information. 
          
         2.2.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         The regional content that is to be inserted into the Web pages would have to 
         be distributed to the corresponding caching proxies. Since the regional 
         content represents only a component of a whole Web page, it cannot be cached 
         in the same way a complete Web page can be cached (unless it is an image). We 
         have to find a mechanism to determine when a regional text component needs to 
         be updated (or if the content provider should be responsible for this). 
          
          
      2.3  Assembling of Personalized Web Pages 
          
         2.3.1 Abstract 
          
         Many Web sites (e.g. Yahoo) offer a service where users can create their own 
         personalized version of the Web site (e.g. MyYahoo). It basically means that 
         a user can choose from a number of components (e.g. stock information, 
         weather forecasts, news etc.) and create a personalized Web page with them. 
         This leads to dynamic Web pages that usually cannot be cached. However, the 
         components of the personalized Web page can be cached. Therefore, it is 
         possible to have a service module on the server create the user-specific Web 
         pages by assembling the cached Web site components. In that case the origin 
         server would not have to be contacted again and the page could be served to 
         the client directly from the network edge caching proxy. 
          
         2.3.2 Business Model

      Internet Draft      OPES Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios        July 2001 
       
         This service would be another method of accelerating the delivery of Web 
         content to the user, particularly the delivery of personalized/customized Web 
         pages that would not be cacheable otherwise. It also saves bandwidth between 
         the origin server and the proxy cache. 
          
         Content providers who offer their customers the possibility of personalizing 
         their Web pages are likely to be willing to pay for this kind of service.  
          
         2.3.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         We would have to find a caching mechanism for the separate components of the 
         personalized Web pages (unless a component consists of an image only). These 
         components could be stored at the caching proxy. 
          
         The page components would have to be refreshed just like complete Web page 
         whenever they become stale. 
          
          
      2.4  Content Adaptation for Alternate Web Access Devices 
          
         2.4.1 Abstract 
          
         There is a growing diversity and heterogeneity in types and capabilities of 
         client devices as well as the forms of network connections that people use to 
         access the Web. Clients include cell phones and PDAs as well as PCs, TVs 
         (with SetTop boxes), etc. However, these appliances have quite diverse 
         display capabilities, storage, processing power, as well as slow network 
         access. As a result, Internet access is still constrained on these devices 
         and users are limited to only a small fraction of the total number of Web 
         pages available in the Internet today. Organizations such as the WAP forum 
         [4] have suggested custom Web page design but this results in special code 
         frequently required on the content server. 
          
         Since the number of different access devices is growing constantly content 
         providers cannot be expected to provide different versions of their Web pages 
         for each and every Web access device that is available in the market. 
          
         Therefore, if it is possible to transcode the general full-fledged Web pages 
         at some point on their way from the origin server to the user so that they 
         are optimized for (or at least adapted to) the end users' specific 
         requirements, it would provide a valuable service for the end customer, the 
         service provider, and the content provider. 
          
         2.4.2 Business model 
          
         With the above-mentioned service in place, Web content providers could reach 
         a much wider audience and the manufactures of diverse Web access devices 
         could offer potential customers access to a bigger part of the Internet 
         content, which should make a very good selling point. It would encourage more 
         people to buy non-desktop Web access devices like cell phones and PDAs 
         expanding the market.

         We would expect this service would be offered as an additional feature to ISP 
         customers who want to access the Web through different Web-enabled devices. 
         Also, the service might be paid by content providers because they could serve 
         their existing content to more users; likewise, the non-desktop device makers 
         may contribute to this service cost making their client devices more 
         effective at the Web. 
          
         2.4.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         Possible adaptations to meet the special requirements of different Web access 
         devices are:

         We have to ensure that the automatic adaptation process will not make changes 
         to a Web page that are unwanted by either the content provider or the 
         recipient. Our suggested strategy to achieve this would be to allow the 
         content provider as well as the client to define their preferences as to how 
         they want Web pages to be adapted. The actual adaptation decisions would then 
         be made based on the given preferences and a set of transformation rules. 
         There would have to be a mechanism of resolving potential conflicts between 
         the content provider's and the user's adaptation preferences. If neither the 
         content provider nor the client has expressed his preferences, a default 
         adaptation of the requested Web page may be possible but investigation is 
         needed. 
          
         A way for preferences to be specified representing the content provider and 
         client customer must be provided. For example, client customers could set 
         their preferences through a Web interface on the ISP Web site. Content 
         providers could express their preferences by adding meta tags to their Web 
         pages. This meta data offers the content provider the ability to specify a 
         number of alternatives and the content adaptation server could then pick the 
         most appropriate one. This meta data should be independent of specific Web 
         content but is likely to depend on the types of content in the pages. Another 
         possibility in the ESPWF [2, 7] framework would be for the content provider 
         would be to provide an adaptation policy to all ISPs that want to adapt Web 
         pages for alternate Web access devices. This policy could consist of general 
         transformation rules or actual code modules that perform the adaptation.

      Internet Draft      OPES Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios        July 2001 
       
         Different Internet clients can handle different Internet connection speeds. 
         Therefore it seems desirable to adapt the requested Web content to the user∆s 
         bandwidth.  
          
         2.5.2 Business model 
          
         One of the main benefits is to decrease the Web access time for users. If a 
         Web site loads too slowly, users tend to leave the site even before it has 
         completed loading the home page. The improved perceived quality of service by 
         adaptive content delivery means that users are more likely to stay and 
         return, thus resulting in a greater profit for e-commerce sites. This can 
         also result in higher hit rates and return rates, which can lead to higher 
         sales for e-commerce sites and higher advertising revenues. 
          
         2.5.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         Possible adaptations to reduce the size of Web objects are: 
          
         - Reduction of image quality 
         - Replacement of images by their ALT text 
         - Removal of redundant information 
         - Removal of HTML comments 
         - Stripping of Java applets / JavaScript 
         - Audio to text conversion 
         - Video to key frame or video to text conversion 
         - Text summarizing 
         - Content extraction 
          
         We would have to find a reliable way of determining the bandwidth between the 
         client and the proxy cache. One way of measuring this would be to measure the 
         round trip time (RTT) to determine the connection speed. It is crucial that 
         this bandwidth detection method works more or less exact or otherwise the 
         client will either experience very slow Web browsing or be cut off of some 
         (or all) of the rich Web content. This service requires authorization by the 
         user like any other adaptation service that changes the content and or format 
         of Web pages. 
          
         The mapping of a user∆s connection speed to appropriate page adaptations 
         requires defining a set of adaptation rules. 
          
          
      2.6  Adaptation of Streaming Media 
          
         2.6.1 Abstract 
          
         Some of the above-mentioned services could not only be applied to Web pages 
         but also to streaming media like audio and video streams. In particular, 
         media streams could be adapted to meet the bandwidth of the user∆s 
         connection. It would also be possible to insert pre-recorded advertisements 
         into audio or video streams. Even content analysis and content filtering 
         could be applied to streaming media.

         2.6.2 Business model 
          
         The business models for streaming media adaptation are similar to those for 
         Web page adaptation services.  
          
         2.6.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         The adaptation of streaming media will add more complexity to the caching 
         proxy platform and the technical challenges of these kind of services have 
         yet to be explored. 
          
          
      2.7  Request Filtering 
          
         2.7.1 Abstract 
          
         The  success  of  Web  filtering/blocking  systems  like  NetNanny 
         (http://www.netnanny.com) and WebSense (http://www.websense.com) shows that 
         there is a great need for solutions that let the owner of a Web access device 
         control what kind of Web content can be accessed with his device. Parents, 
         for instance, often demand a means of blocking off offending material when 
         their children browse the Web. Also, companies might want to have control 
         over what kind of Web pages their employees can have access to. Companies 
         might also want to prevent their employees from using the available bandwidth 
         excessively for non-work related activities.  
          
         A request filtering service could provide a solution for all of the above. If 
         all Web page requests of a specific user are routed through a caching proxy 
         server, the content adaptation server could analyze the requests prior to 
         fulfilling them. The service module would have to identify the user and 
         determine the user∆s access level. The next step would be to look up the 
         classification of the requested Web page in a database. 
          
          
         2.7.2 Business model 
          
         This service could be offered to enterprises and to ISPs. A database of Web 
         pages that contain offending material could be obtained from companies that 
         have specialized in Web blocking systems. 
          
         2.7.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         The database on the proxy caching platform that contains the Web page 
         classifications needs to be updated on a regular basis. If the database is 
         provided by third parties, we have to provide them with a secure way of 
         updating the database. 
          
         If a Web access device is shared among different users who have different 
         access levels, it is not sufficient to identify the Web access device. 
         Therefore it will probably be necessary that different users of a Web access 
         device use different user accounts.

         The owner of a Web access device must be able to define and change the access 
         rights of the user(s) of his device. This could be done through a Web 
         interface provided by the ISP/company. 
          
          
      2.8  Request Filtering through Content Analysis 
          
         2.8.1 Abstract 
          
         While this service is very similar to the one previously described, it works 
         more dynamically in that the content adaptation server analyzes the Web 
         content once it has been retrieved from either the proxy cache or the origin 
         server prior to sending it to the client.  
         Through the use of sophisticated content analysis algorithms it should be 
         possible to classify the analyzed Web content. If the classification of the 
         Web page matches the user∆s access level, the page will be delivered to the 
         client. Otherwise, the client will be denied the page. The analyzed page 
         along with its classification should be stored in the proxy cache so that 
         future requests for the same page do not require the cached Web to be 
         analyzed again. This will result in a better Web page delivery performance 
         for popular Web pages. The main benefit of this approach is that there is no 
         need to provide or maintain lists of forbidden Web sites, a process that per 
         definition must always lag behind the creation of new Web sites. If common 
         characteristics of a category of unwanted Web pages can be defined, it should 
         be possible to automatically detect whether a requested Web page falls in a 
         forbidden category.  
          
         2.8.2 Business model 
          
         This service could be offered to enterprises and ISPs. The content analysis 
         software could be obtained from software companies that have specialized in 
         this field. 
          
         2.8.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         In addition to the technical challenges described in the previous service 
         scenario, we would have to find a way of storing the classification 
         information of Web pages once they have been analyzed. One way to do this 
         would be to add a meta tag (possibly using the Resource Description Framework 
         [6] specification) with content rating information to a Web page before it is 
         cached. Subsequent requests of the same Web page would then require the 
         request filtering service module to scan the cached Web page for this 
         metadata in order to determine the content rating of the requested page.  
          
          
      2.9  Search Engine Index on Cached Web Pages  
          
         2.9.1 Abstract 
          
         A proxy usually contains the most frequently requested Web pages of the Web 
         users whose Web requests are routed through it. If we indexed the content of 
         all Web pages currently contained in one or more proxies, we would have an 
         index of Web pages that Web users are very likely to request (since they have 
        
      McHenry et al.              Expires Jan 2002                              10

      Internet Draft      OPES Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios        July 2001 
       
         been the most popular in the past). A search engine based on this index could 
         therefore yield a high hit rate when used by a group of users who have 
         similar interests and usually connect to the same caching proxies. The 
         benefit of this approach would be that the index could be created very fast 
         (there is no Web crawling to do) and that the search results could be 
         returned to the user directly from the network edge caching proxy. The 
         drawback, however, is that this search engine would index only a small 
         fraction of the existing Web pages. Web users have to be aware of this fact 
         when they use the cache-based search index service. Another approach would be 
         to display the proxy search results first while a global search engine 
         prepares the results of a global search in the meantime. As soon as the 
         global search results become available, they will be sent to the user. 
          
         2.9.2 Business model 
          
         The search engine service described above could be sold to big companies who 
         have users with similar interests and want to provide a fast search engine. 
         Companies offering traditional search engines could be interested in 
         combining their services with a cache-based search engine service to 
         accelerate the delivery of their search results. 
          
         2.9.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         If the cached Web pages of more than one caching proxy were to be indexed, we 
         would have to find a way of replicating the search index to all affected 
         caching proxy servers.  
          
          
      2.10 Language Translation 
          
         2.10.1 Abstract 
          
         Soon the majority of all Internet users will be non-English speaking. As most 
         of the current Web content is written in English, it becomes desirable to be 
         able to translate the English content to the Web user∆s local language, even 
         if the content provider does not offer translations of his Web content. An 
         automatic translation service for all Web pages could be implemented with a 
         content adaptation server. 
          
         The proxy server will determine the Web user's preferred language(s) and ask 
         whether the content requested should be translated to the user's preferred 
         language. If the content is to be translated, the proxy cache will forward 
         the Web content to a translation server where the page then is automatically 
         translated. The proxy could also locally store translated content eliminating 
         the need to repeat translations for different users. 
          
         2.10.2 Business model 
          
         The automatic language translation service will help break language barriers 
         and open new markets for e-commerce. The average non-English speaking Web 
         user will have access to more Web content. ISPs, especially those with 
         customers in non-English speaking countries, could offer this service to 
         their customers.

         2.10.3 Technical Challenges 
          
         The automatic translation of text found on Web pages is not a trivial task. 
         It will not be possible to translate a Web page automatically without running 
         the risk of rendering parts of it incomprehensible. Worse yet, the original 
         meaning could be changed and it is not said the reader of the translated page 
         will notice the change in meaning. It is questionable whether content 
         providers would even tolerate this kind of translation service.  
          
         Therefore it is very important that the client authorizes this translation 
         service and is fully aware of its potentially faulty behavior. It should also 
         be considered to mark translated pages in a specific way to remind the user 
         of the machine translation.  
          
         Other technical challenges include the automatic detection of the language 
         used in the original document and the client∆s local language.

      3  Types Of Services 
       
         Operationally, the proxy/gateways processing of the in-stream data can be 
         broken into fast-path and slow-path operations.  Fast-path can be 
         characterized as deterministic operations that can be done in real-time 
         without interfering with the provisioned performance and scale of the device.  
          

        
      McHenry et al.              Expires Jan 2002                              12

      Internet Draft      OPES Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios        July 2001 
       
         Proxying of the data without any additional services clearly falls into the 
         fast-path.  Additional services such as the proposed Edge Side Includes (ESI) 
         initially suggest that they also fit into fast-path, since they have 
         predictable behavior and thus can be optimized for real time processing.   
          
         Other services such as virus detection have unpredictable processing times 
         and stall the pipeline process of the proxy.  This suggests a slow-path 
         operation.  Experience has shown that slow-path operations can adversely 
         affect the performance and scaling proxies.  Having an OPES callout RPC to a 
         Ùbuddyˆ server for these operations makes sense, since the operation itself 
         is much more expensive to perform than the latency tax of the callout RPC 
         protocol.  The strategy is to have a separate cooperating system handle these 
         expensive operations and keep the more precious proxy resources applied to 
         fast-path operations. 
          
         There doesn∆t appear to be a one size fits all for OPES callout RPC 
         protocols.  Operations that work on headers (URL rewrite comes to mind) or 
         small objects are well suited to fine grain RPCs, while operations that work 
         on entire objects (e.g., virus scanners) are well suited to complete stream 
         vectoring RPCs. Therefore, the OPES framework needs to specify callout 
         protocol requirements that allow for the possibility of multiple callout 
         protocols in order to optimally address these differences. 
          
         Remote callouts should also provide an extensible services model for proxies 
         as well.  Many of the  proxies are appliance based and don't allow general 
         services to be hosted on them in order to maintain highly reliable and 
         deterministic service.  OPES remote callouts provide a mechanism to deploy 
         new services that may eventually be implemented in the fast-path should their 
         service demands warrant it.  
          
      4  Network Topologies 
         (These are illustrations of potential topologies, not scenarios, per se) 
       
      4.1  Callout Services on the Edge Proxy Device 
       
         This section will describe topologies for services that are likely to be 
         placed on an edge proxy device (e.g., for fast-path operations). Examples of 
         services that can be hosted on the edge device include caching, localization 
         and personalization services. 
       
      4.2  Callout Services on collocated callout servers 
              (e.g., inside the same administrative domain) 
       
         This section will describe topologies for services that are likely to be 
         placed on an nearby callout device (e.g., for slow-path operations). In this 
         topology, a callout server is a separate device collocated with the edge 
         server. This topology would be useful for virus scanning, transcoding of 
         streaming protocols. 
       
      4.3  Callout Services on non-collocated callout servers  
              (e.g., outside the same administrative domain) 
       
         This section will describe topologies for services that are likely to be 
         placed on an not-nearby callout device (e.g., for slow-path operations or

         fee-based transformations). Topologically (from a network perspective), this 
         is identical to the previous example. However, the callout server would be 
         located outside of the administrative domain in which the edge server 
         resides. 
       
      4.4  Callout for streaming services 
       
         This section will describe topologies for services that are likely to be 
         placed on an edge device used for modification of streaming data. 
       
       
      5  Component Deployment Scenarios 
         (This section would outline the places an edge server might be deployed and 
         what types of services might be hosted on them) 
       
      5.1  Near the edge 
       
         This section will contain a discussion of the deployment of edge services on 
         edge servers near the edge of the network. 
       
      5.2  In Front of Servers 
       
         This section will contain a discussion of the deployment of edge services on 
         edge servers that are located in front of Origin servers. 
       
      5.3  At hosting centers 
       
         This section will contain a discussion of the deployment of edge services on 
         edge servers that are located at remote hosting centers. 
          
       
      6  Processing Scenarios 
       
      6.1  Edge Side Includes 
       
         In this scenario, container pages are composed by the edge server from a 
         collection of includes, most of which are statically cached for a period of 
         time.  Optimally as fast-path operations handled by local (intrinsic) service 
         modules.   
          
      6.2  Virus Scanning 
          
         Edge server virus scanning‡  In this scenario, large objects that are suspect 
         for viruses are delivered to remote callout servers for parallel processing.  
         Optimally as slow-path operations handled by remote service modules.   
       
       
      7  Rules In Edge Devices 
          
         (This section will contain a brief discussion of how rules might be applied 
         in an edge server)
