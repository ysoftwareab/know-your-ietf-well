          Revision to Capability Codes Registration Procedures
             draft-ietf-idr-capabilities-registry-change-09

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration
   procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range
   formerly designated "Reserved for Private Use" is divided into three
   new ranges, respectively designated as "First Come First Served",
   "Experimental Use" and "Reserved".

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol uses a mechanism called "Capability
   Advertisement" [RFC5492] to enable BGP peers to tell one another
   about their optional protocol extensions.  These so-called
   "Capabilities" are signaled using code points called "Capability
   Codes".

   [RFC5492] designates the range of Capability Codes 128-255 as
   "Reserved for Private Use".  Subsequent experience has shown this to
   be not only useless, but actively confusing to implementors.

   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures for
   the range 128-255, as follows, using the terminology defined in
   [RFC8126]:

   o  128-238: First Come First Served
   o  239-254: Experimental Use
   o  255: Reserved

   The procedures for the ranges 1-63 and 64-127 are unchanged,
   remaining "IETF Review" and "First Come First Served" respectively.

2.  Discussion

   The reason for providing an Experimental Use range is to preserve a
   range for use during early development.  Although there are few
   practical differences between Experimental and Private Use, the
   change both makes it clear that code points from this space should
   not be used long-term or in shipping products, and reduces the
   consumption of the scarce Capability Code space expended for this
   purpose.  Once classified as Experimental, it should be considered

   difficult to reclassify the space for some other purpose in the
   future.

   The reason for reserving the maximum value is that it may be useful
   in the future if extension of the number space is needed.

   Since the range 128-255 was formerly designated Private Use,
   implementors may have chosen to use code points within that range
   prior to publication of this document.  For this reason, a survey was
   conducted beginning August 14, 2015 (version 01 of the individual
   draft) to find any such uses.  A number were contributed and were
   used to seed Table 2.  Of course there can be no guarantee that all
   uses were discovered, however the likelihood seems high that
   remaining uses, if any, genuinely do fall under the intended use of
   "Private Use" and are restricted to some special deployment, and are
   not in wide use.  Furthermore, any remaining uses would be no worse
   than any other code point collision, such as occasionally occurs with
   code point "squatting", and could be dealt with in the same manner.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to revise the "Capability Codes" registry in the
   "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group as follows.

   Reference: [RFC5492] and this document.

   Registration procedures:

   IANA is requested to perform the following new allocations within the
   "Capability Codes" registry:

4.  Security Considerations

   This revision to registration procedures does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing [RFC5492] and
   [RFC4271].
