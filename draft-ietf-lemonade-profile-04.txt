Abstract 
    
   This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions, 
   restrictions and usage modes) of the IMAP and mail submission 
   protocols. This profile allows clients (especially those that are 
   constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas) 
   to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail. 
   This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to 
   download and upload the mail, to optimize submission and to 
   efficiently reconnect in case of loss of connectivity with the 
   server.  
    
   The Lemonade profile relies upon extensions to IMAP and Mail 
   Submission protocols; specifically URLAUTH and CATENATE IMAP protocol 
   [RFC3501] extensions and BURL extension to the SUBMIT protocol 
   [RFC2476].

1.    Introduction 
    
   Lemonade provides enhancements to Internet email to support diverse 
   service environments.  
    
   This document describes the lemonade profile phase 1 that includes: 
      - "Forward without download" that describes exchanges between 
        Lemonade clients and servers to allow to submit new email 
        messages incorporating content which resides on locations 
        external to the client. 
      - Quick reconnect   
    
   The organization of this document is as follows.  Section 2 describes 
   the Forward without download. Section 3 describes additional SMTP 
   extensions that must be supported by all Lemonade Submission servers. 
   Section 4 describes IMAP quick reconnect.  
    
2.   Forward without download 
    
2.1.     Motivations 
    
   The advent of client/server email using the [RFC3501], [RFC2821] and 
   [RFC2476] protocols has changed what formerly were local disk 
   operations to become excessive and repetitive network data 
   transmissions.  
    
   Lemonade "forward without download" makes use of the [BURL] SUBMIT 
   extension to enable access to external sources during the submission 
   of a message.  In combination with the IMAP [URLAUTH] extension, 
   inclusion of message parts or even entire messages from the IMAP mail 
   store is possible with a minimal trust relationship between the IMAP 
   and SMTP SUBMIT servers. 
    
   Lemonade "forward without download" has the advantage of maintaining 
   one submission protocol, and thus avoids the risk of having multiple 
   parallel and possible divergent mechanisms for submission. The 
   client can use Submit/SMTP [RFC2476] extensions without these being 
   added to IMAP. Furthermore, by keeping the details of message 
   submission in the SMTP SUBMIT server, Lemonade "forward without 
   download" can work with other message retrieval protocols such as 
   POP, NNTP, or whatever else may be designed in the future. 
    
2.2.     Message Sending Overview

   The act of sending an email message can be thought of as involving 
   multiple steps: initiation of a new draft, draft editing, message 
   assembly, and message submission. 
    
   Initiation of a new draft and draft editing takes place on the MUA. 
   Frequently, users choose to save more complex messages on an 
   [RFC3501] server (via the APPEND command with the \Draft flag) for 
   later recall by the MUA and resumption of the editing process. 
    
   Message assembly is the process of producing a complete message from 
   the final revision of the draft and external sources.  At assembly 
   time, external data is retrieved and inserted in the message. 
    
   Message submission is the process of inserting the assembled message 
   into the [RFC2821] infrastructure, typically using the [RFC2476] 
   protocol. 
    
2.3.     Traditional Strategy 
    
   Traditionally, messages are initiated, edited, and assembled entirely 
   within an MUA, although drafts may be saved to an [RFC3501] server 
   and later retrieved from the server.  The completed text is then 
   transmitted to an MSA for delivery. 
    
   There is often no clear boundary between the editing and assembly 
   process.  If a message is forwarded, its content is often retrieved 
   immediately and inserted into the message text.  Similarly, when 
   external content is inserted or attached, the content is usually 
   retrieved immediately and made part of the draft. 
    
   As a consequence, each save of a draft and subsequent retrieve of the 
   draft transmits that entire (possibly large) content, as does message 
   submission. 
    
   In the past, this was not much of a problem, because drafts, external 
   data, and the message submission mechanism were typically located on 
   the same system as the MUA.  The most common problem was running out 
   of disk quota.

   The model distinguishes between a Messaging User Agent (MUA), an 
   IMAPv4Rev1 Server ([RFC3501]) and a SMTP submit server ([RFC2476]), 
   as illustrated in Figure 1.

             Figure 1: Lemonade "forward without download" 
             
    
   Lemonade "forward without download" allows a Messaging User Agent to 
   compose and forward an e-mail combining fragments that are located in 
   an IMAP server, without having to download these fragments to the 
   server. 
    
   In the [BURL]/[CATENATE] variant of the Lemonade "forward without 
   download" strategy, messages are initially composed and edited within 
   an MUA.  The [CATENATE] extension to [RFC3501] is then used to create

   the messages on the IMAP server by transmitting new text and 
   assembling them. [UIDPLUS] IMAP extension is used by the client in 
   order to learn the UID of the created messages. Finally a [URLAUTH] 
   format URL is given to a [RFC2476] server for submission using the 
   [BURL] extension. 
 
   The flow involved to support such a use case consists of: 
      M: {to I -- Optional} The client connects to the IMAP server, 
     opens a mailbox ("INBOX" in the example below) and fetches body 
     structures (See [RFC3501]). 
      
     Example: 
           M: A0051 UID FETCH 25627 (UID BODYSTRUCTURE) 
           I: * 161 FETCH (UID 25627 BODYSTRUCTURE (("TEXT" "PLAIN" 
              ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)( 
              "TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" "NAME"  
              "trip.txt")  
              "<960723163407.20117h@washington.example.net>" 
              "Your trip details" "BASE64" 4554 73) "MIXED")) 
           I: A0051 OK completed 
      
      M: {to I} The client invokes CATENATE (See [CATENATE] for details 
     of the semantics and steps - this allows the MUA to create messages 
     on the IMAP using new data combined with one or more message part 
     already present on the IMAP server.

2.5.     Normative statements related to forward without download 
    
   Lemonade compliant IMAP servers MUST support IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501], 
   CATENATE [CATENATE], UIDPLUS [UIDPLUS] and URLAUTH [URLAUTH]. This

   Additional normative statements are provided in other sections. 
    
 
2.6.     Security Considerations for pawn-tickets. 
    
   The so-called "pawn-ticket" authorization mechanism uses a URI, which 
   contains its own authorization credentials using [URLAUTH].  The 
   advantage of this mechanism is that the SMTP submit [RFC2476] server 
   cannot access any data on the [RFC3501] server without a "pawn-
   ticket" created by the client.   
    
   The "pawn-ticket" grants access only to the specific data that the 
   SMTP submit [RFC2476] server is authorized to access, can be revoked 
   by the client, and can have a time-limited validity. 
    
    
2.7.     The fcc problem 
    
   The "fcc problem" refers to delivering a copy of a message to a 
   "file carbon copy" recipient.  By far, the most common case of fcc is 
   a client leaving a copy of outgoing mail in a "sent messages" or 
   "outbox" mailbox. 
    
   In the traditional strategy, the MUA duplicates the effort spent in 
   transmitting to the MSA by writing the message to the fcc destination 
   in a separate step.  This may be a write to a local disk file or an 
   APPEND to a mailbox on an IMAP server.  The latter is one of the 
   "excessive and repetitive network data transmissions" which 
   represents the "problem" aspect of the "fcc problem". 
    
   The [CATENATE] extension to [RFC3501] addresses the fcc problem.  It 
   requires making several simplifying assumptions: 
       (1a) there is one, and only one, fcc destination on a single 
   server 
       (2a) the server which holds the fcc is the same as the server 
   which stages the outgoing message for submission 
        
    
   << Editor's note: [POSTADDRESS] can be used to address issues (1a) 
   and (2a). To be done later>> 
    
    
3.   Message Submission 
    
   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers are expected to implement 
   the following set of SMTP extensions to make message submission 
   efficient.

                          <Lemonade Profile>            September 2005 
 
 
   Lemonade clients SHOULD take advantage of these features. 
    
 
 
3.1.     Pipelining 
    
   Mobile clients regularly use networks with a relatively high latency.  
   Avoidance of round-trips within a transaction has a great advantage 
   for the reduction in both bandwidth and total transaction time.  
   For this reason LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST 
   support the SMTP Service Extensions for Command Pipelining [REF2197].   
    
   Clients SHOULD pipeline. 
    
    
3.2.     DSN Support 
    
   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP service 
   extensions for delivery status notifications [RFC3461]. 
    
    
3.3.     Message size declaration 
    
   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST support the SMTP 
   Service Extension for Message Size Declaration [RFC2927]. 
    
3.4.     Enhanced status code Support 
    
   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP Service 
   Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes [RFC2034]. 
    
    
4.   Quick Reconnect scheme 
    
   Mobile operators usually charge users for the time their mobile 
   client is connected to the Internet and/or for the amount of 
   information sent/received. Thus a mobile client might want to 
   minimize the time it stays connected to its mail server, which 
   suggests that it should disconnect and reconnect frequently. 
    
   Also, it is possible that the mobile client unexpectedly leaves an 
   area of connectivity, which will require that the client reconnects 
   when connectivity returns. This may also be a voluntary disconnect; 
   something that does not need to be distinguished at the level of the 
   protocol. 
    
   IMAP can be verbose. Usually, in order to synchronize a client with a 
   server after a disconnect, the client needs to issue at least the

                          <Lemonade Profile>            September 2005 
 
 
   following commands: LOGIN/AUTHENTICATE, SELECT and several FETCH 
   commands (see [IMAP-DISC] for more details). 
    
   Thus, there is a desire to have a quick reconnect facility in IMAP, 
   which will give a mobile client the ability to resume a previously 
   abandoned session, without the need to perform the full 
   synchronization sequence as described above.

7.   Future work  
    
   Future phases of the Lemonade profile are expected to address issues 
   related to access of email from mobile devices, possibly including: 
      - Media conversion (static and possibly streamed) 
      - Transport optimization for low or costly bandwidth and less 
        reliable mobile networks 
      - Server to client notifications possibly outside of the 
        traditional IMAP band 
      - Dealing with firewall and intermediaries 
      - Compression and other bandwidth optimization 
      - Filtering  
      - Other considerations for mobile clients

8.   Security Considerations 
    
   Security considerations on Lemonade "forward without download" are 
   discussed throughout section 2. Additional security considerations 
   can be found in [RFC3501], [UIDPLUS], [URLAUTH], [BURL] and 
   [RECONNECT]. 
    
    
8.1.     TLS 
    
   When LEMONADE clients uses the BURL extension to mail Submission, an 
   extension that requires sending a URLAUTH token to the mail 
   submission server, such a token should be protected from interception 
   to avoid a replay attack that will disclose the contents of the 
   message to an attacker. TLS based encryption of the mail submission 
   path will provide protection against this attack.   
    
   LEMONADE Compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP Service 
   Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS [RFC2487]. Clients are expected to 
   authenticate with the submit server.  
    
   LEMONADE Compliant IMAP servers MUST support IMAP over TLS [RFC3501] 
   as required by RFC 3501. Clients are expected to authenticate with 
   the IMAP server.  
    
   LEMONADE clients SHOULD use TLS protected IMAP and mail submission 
   channels when using BURL-based message submission to protect the 
   URLAUTH token from interception. 
    
   LEMONADE Compliant mail submission server SHOULD use TLS protected 
   IMAP connection when fetching message content using the URLAUTH token 
   provided by the LEMONADE client. 
    
   When a client uses SMTP STARTTLS to send a BURL command which 
   references non-public information there is a user expectation that 
   the entire message content will be treated confidentially.  To 
   address this expectation, the message submission server should use 
   STARTTLS or a mechanism providing equivalent data confidentiality 
   when fetching the content referenced by that URL.

   This document doesn't require any IANA registration or action.
