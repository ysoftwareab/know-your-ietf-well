2. Introduction 
    
   Over the last several years, the available bandwidth in the core 
   networks has increased dramatically, in the same time offering price 
   per Mbyte has gone down. Most business today has multi site office 
   complexes. Some of these organizations are exploring the opportunity 
   of outsourcing their inter site enterprise network to Application 
   Service Providers. With the possible opportunities in this segment 
   increasing, Service Providers are now rushing to build a new class 
   of networks based on Metropolitan Area Networks. This new class of 
   network intends to provide a virtual Internetwork for customers who 
   wish to connect there geographically dispersed sites using public 
   networks at very high speeds (10Mbps and above). In this document we 
   define these networks as Virtual Metropolitan Internetwork or VMI. 
   The service that provides VMI is defined as Virtual Metropolitan 
   Internetwork Services (VMIS). 
    
   Issues, requirements, architecture and business model of VMI is 
   significantly different than that of the better known Virtual 
   Private Network (VPN) or traditional Internetwork. This document 
   intends to provide a framework for VMIS and documents Issues, 
   requirements, architecture and business model when providing VMIS.

   In addition, several equipment vendors are building products to 
   address this growing market in the Metropolitan Network space. 
   However, there is lack of coordination and definition of the 
   problem. In that aspect, this document attempts to consolidate 
   widely used models and defines the problem space and identifies 
   different solutions. 
    
   At present there are several infrastructure models used in providing 
   VMIS. In this document we present each of these models separately. 
   Under each model, issues, requirements, architecture and business 
   model is discussed. 
    
   Both customers and providers define requirements. As an example, a 
   customer may wish to obtain a service that connect multiple sites 
   and requires multiprotocol transport. Based on these requirements, 
   the Service Provider may define that either a need for a CPE 
   (Customer Premise Equipment) or separate connection per service or 
   combination of both. As another example, customer may wish to have 
   end-to-end guaranteed bandwidth. In order to provide this service, 
   provider may have different set of requirements that customer have 
   to meet. 
    
   Business model, in the past, was mainly dictated by the service 
   providers. Here we envision that, business model is something that 
   is customized based on the requirements. 
    
   The architecture and issues are direct dependents of the 
   requirements and business model. Hence, it is important to well 
   define and understand the requirements and the business model. 
    
   Architecture of the VMIS defines the entire infrastructure that 
   requires satisfying the requirements within an agreed business 
   model. The architecture of the infrastructure include, but not 
   limited to, the backbone transport layer mechanism, network 
   management and accounting, Traffic Engineering and QoS issues etc. 
   Hence, with a given infrastructure one may only be able to satisfy 
   some subset of requirements and business models. Hence in this 
   document we presents, different infrastructure models and try to 
   identify and underline the types of requirements and business models 
   that can be satisfied within the architecture. 
    
   When delivering requirements within a business model with a given 
   infrastructure, there are always issues and problems, we try to 
   identify and present those issues in this document. 
    
   This document is considered a living document and may change, as 
   more information and deployment scenarios become available. 
    
1.1 VMI Taxonomy and Analogy 
    
   In this section we define Taxonomy and Analogy of Virtual 
   Metropolitan Internetwork. Defining the taxonomy facilitates proper 
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                         4 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   definition of the problem in hand; Virtual Metropolitan 
   Internetwork. 
    
   VMI Taxonomy: 
    
        o VMI Infrastructure. A collection of VMI Service Provider∆s 
          equipment and methods used to implement VMI service. All 
          VMI networks share a common infrastructure. 
    
        o VMI Network. A virtual network service offered by a VMI 
          Service Provider, as seen by an End User. Multiple, 
          mutually exclusive networks exist within the same, shared 
          infrastructure. 
         
        o VMI Service Management. A VMI Service Provider∆s means 
          of managing operations of VMI networks. 
    
   In general, a VMI is composed of point-to-point, point-to-multipoint 
   and multi-point-to-multi-point. Any combination of these topologies 
   can be accommodated in a VMI.  
   VMI Analogy: 
    
   Given the above taxonomy or the definition of the Virtual 
   Metropolitan Internetwork, following analogy is drawn. VMI is 
   considered as stack of dices on a base, or "Tower of Hanoi". Each of 
   these dices represents a separate virtual network. The base 
   represents the Infrastructure. Pin in the middle represents the 
   management plane.

1.2 Network format(Service Model) for Virtual Metropolitan Internetwork 
    
   Presently there are several models that are used to provide VMI 
   Services. Each of these models may suites to customers based on 
   their requirement. Some service providers exclusively support only 
   one model; such providers may not be able to accommodate some 
   customer requirement. In this section we summarize possible service 
   models that different customer may need based on the requirements. 
   In subsequent sections each of these service model is analyzed in 
   detail. 
    
        o Fully meshed; many-to-many network model 
    
        o Partially meshed; point-to-multipoint(hub and spoke) model 
    
        o point-to-point model 
    
        o hierarchical, multi domain model 
    
1.3 VPN vs. VMI 
    
   Understanding the key differences between VPN and VMI is important. 
   This understanding facilitates one to appreciate the problems, 
   issues, and strength and business model of VMI clearly. 
    
   o Service. In simple terms, VMI is a service, while VPN is a 
   technology. A VMI specification is broader than that of a VPN, 
   covering areas that VPNs typically consider beyond their scope. 
    
   o User/Provider Context. VMI recognizes the demarcation between the 
   User and the Provider and the consequences of asymmetric 
   responsibilities and expectations. The Provider is the entity that 
   offers its services to the receiving entity, the User. 
    
   o Gateway Functions. VMI networks, similarly to VPNs, are private, 
   intended for interconnecting sites belonging to the same 
   administrative entity.  Unlike VPNs, however, VMIs define optional 
   Provider Gateway Functions, which are methods for secure access to 
   VMI networks for the purpose of supplying additional network 
   services. 
    
    
    
1.4 VMIS Requirements 
    
   VMIS requirements derive the service model. VMIS requirements can be 
   broadly classified into several areas. 
    
   o number of sites that required to be connected. 
    
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                         6 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   o Required network topology; hub and spoke with all sites connecting 
   to the data center or fully meshed emulated Local Area Network or 
   combination. 
    
   o Type of connectivity required; Layer 2 or IP routing. 
    
   o Traffic engineering and QoS requirements; end-to-end guaranteed 
   bandwidth. 
    
   o Security; traffic separation, payload encryption and 
   authentication. 
    
   o Billing requirements; wholesale models vs. per byte billing. 
    
   o Service Level Agreement (SLA); Time of the day bandwidth vs. flat 
   bandwidth 
    
   o Traffic reporting and accounting; statistics, exceptions, faults, 
   etc. 
    
   o Gateway Functions; option for the Provider to offer extra services 
   on the private VMI networks.

   Simple Many-to-Many Virtual Metropolitan Internetwork 
    
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                         7 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   Many-to-Many VMI network model is ideally suited for customers who 
   wanted to have multiple sites connected, via a public network, to 
   form a one single network. In this topology, either they extend 
   their Local Network as a layer 2 connectivity or may choose to 
   introduce to create a routed virtual core. Many-to-Many Virtual 
   Metropolitan Internetwork model is particularly useful for the 
   environment where service offering is to extend the customer's 
   enterprise network using the shared network. Many-to-Many VMI model 
   is by far the most general model. Using this model, one may 
   construct any of the other models. The PE devices providing Many-to-
   Many service model requires handling some special situations, these 
   issues are presented in this section. 
    
2.0.1 QoS and traffic Engineering  
    
   Customers may now wish to have same QoS and Traffic Engineering 
   characteristics as they are in a Locally connected network. Hence, 
   now the problem is not providing end-to-end QoS service but an issue 
   of providing Network wide QoS and traffic engineering. However, in 
   general, a given flow, whether Layer 2 or 3, is point-to-point in 
   nature. On the other hand, broadcast and multicast nature of Local 
   networks can be emulated using set of fully meshed point-to-point 
   networks. In theory, this simplifies the problem and it is an issue 
   of providing, required QoS level per point-to-point link. If all 
   sites are symmetric in QoS and Traffic Engineering requirements, the 
   management of QoS and parameters becomes simple. However, in theory, 
   it is possible to have different sites with varying Traffic 
   engineering parameters. In such a configuration it is important that 
   participating nodes have knowledge of the requirements of the other 
   nodes and impose shaping and policing appropriately. 
    
    
   Consider the deployment scenario below. When, node A is sourcing 
   broadcast traffic it is required not to over-subscribe the link 
   between A-C, which is only 50% incoming rate of ingress port A'. 
   Hence, it is essential that participating nodes are capable of 
   performing egress traffic shaping, as required. 
    
                       B(node)   
                      / |  
        5 Mbits/sec  /  | 
                    /   | 
                   /    | 
   5 Mbits/sec    /     | 
   --------A'-- A(node) | 5 Mbits/sec 
                  \     | 
                   \    | 
                    \   | 
      2.5 Mbits/sec  \  | 
                      \C(node) 
    
   The discovery of these parameters can be either via an automatic 
   process or via manual configuration. It is possible that some of 
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                         8 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   these information can be piggy backed to routing protocols such as 
   OSPF and BGP and advertised to other devices, thereby reducing the 
   management burden. Alternatively, one may have a system wide 
   management system that would provision the services. 
    
    
2.0.2 Reliability 
    
   Different customers may require different levels of reliability. The 
   reliability here defined as, protection against in advent 
   infrastructure or control plane failures. Protection against such 
   failures needed to be built in to the infrastructure and backbone 
   transport protocol. Protection can be defined in many flavors such 
   as Primary/Secondary, Fast Reroute. Protection can also have 
   additional attributes such as time to restore (50 msec) as well. As 
   an example, MPLS fast reroute and backup path protection may be 
   needed for some customers who mandate higher level of reliability. 
   On the other hand, these levels of reliability may be included in 
   Service Level Agreement (SLA) and may be part of the contractual 
   agreement. Thus, Service Providers are legally bound to satisfy 
   these requirements. Inability to provide agreed upon reliability 
   levels may have financial and/or legal ramifications. In the same 
   time, these levels of protection may be essential for operation of 
   their applications. 
    
2.0.3 Reconfiguration 
    
   It is important to provide uninterrupted services to the customers 
   during maintenance and upgrades. Thus, methods are essential to be 
   built into the infrastructure for graceful reconfiguration during 
   maintenance. Unlike, redundancy provided to address required 
   reliability, the redundancy required during maintenance is temporary 
   and may be configured manually. 
    
2.0.4 Data Security and Authentication 
    
   In VMI Services, customer's data is exposed to the shared network at 
   the Provider side. A VMI service provider might use services from 
   other upstream providers for global backbone connectivity. Hence, 
   privacy may be an issue. Traditionally, it has been the 
   responsibility of the customer to use their own technology (IPSec) 
   to provide privacy, but with VMI service offerings of 1Gbps this 
   opens a new set of performance issues. It is quite attractive if the 
   VMI service provider can offer encryption and security. It is quite 
   possible, a customer sharing the infrastructure with the 
   competitors. Hence, it is required that customers have ability to 
   protect and authenticate data.  
    
   o Simple Traffic Separation. In many situations a simple, virtual 
   separation of traffic may be sufficient. This style of security, 
   frequently referred to as Frame-Relay-like, has gained wide 
   acceptance in the market place. The provider is entrusted with 
   making sure VMI traffic remains inaccessible to other end users. The

                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   level of security is low, it protects against attacks from other End 
   Users, but not the Provider itself. 
    
   o Advanced Security. For more sensitive applications, more secure 
   means, involving encryption and authentication techniques, are 
   necessary. Essentially there are two approaches to solve this. In 
   the first approach, customers may choose to install on premise data 
   encryption devices. Here, there needs to be an out of band 
   management connectivity between encryption devices. In the second 
   approach Service provider edge devices may themselves provide data 
   encryption and authentication. Due to the many-to-many connectivity 
   nature of the topology under discussion in this section, Security 
   Association establishment and Encryption key distribution become 
   more complex. Security Architecture for many-to-many networks is 
   presented in [3]. It discusses security architecture of common 
   access networks based on a case study related to VMI. 
    
2.0.5 Broadcast and Multicast forwarding 
    
   In the many-to-many network not all links have the same transport 
   layer characteristics. Broadcast, multicast packets are required to 
   be replicated to multiple links with different characteristics. When 
   providing Layer 2 connectivity the Provider Edge devices are 
   required to replicate unknown unicast packets as well. Hence, the 
   Provider Edge devices that are providing many-to-many connectivity 
   MUST have methods to replicates packets over different transport 
   layer characteristics. 
    
2.0.6 Transport Mechanism in the core 
    
   There are multiple transport layer mechanisms that are capable of 
   providing the many-to-many network layer connectivity. Choice of the 
   appropriate transport layer depends on the set of above requirements 
   that a given service provider address. As an example, on the simple 
   side one may choose to have a complete Layer 2 topology with simpler 
   layer 2 protocol to provide redundancy and reconfiguration. On the 
   other hand, if a service provider chooses to support the entire set 
   of requirements, he may choose more sophisticated protocol like 
   MPLS. In theory, it is possible that multiple transport layer 
   protocols are supported in the core. It is possible that a VMI 
   service provider enrolls a customer where all the sites are NOT 
   within the footprint of the provider. This would be the case if the 
   VMI service provider uses one set of transport layer mechanisms 
   (MPLS) within its footprint and another (IP-Sec, GRE, etc..) for 
   service consistency through some public backbone (Internet). 
   Obviously various usage policies (QoS) would have to be different 
   based on the available resources. Obviously, various usage policies 
   (QoS) would have to be different based on the available resources. 
   However, it is perceived that most Service Providers would implement 
   a single transport layer mechanism in the core. 
    
2.0.7 Layer 2 Address Learning 
    
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                        10 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   If the transport mechanism used in the core is based on layer 2, it 
   is possible that the devices in the middle are required to learn a 
   large number of MAC addresses. In addition they may be required to 
   perform forwarding based on different customer contexts. If this is 
   chosen then the MAC Forwarding data MUST remain unique per VLAN to 
   eliminate multiple sites having the same MAC address (Decnet, SNA 
   etc..)  
    
   If one choose to tunnel layer 2 traffic across the core, the address 
   learning and forwarding decisions are only limited to the Provider 
   Edge devices. Thus helping to scale better. 
    
   Most devices have a finite number of MAC addresses they can support. 
   A Denial of Service attack can be easily performed by blasting large 
   amount of MAC addresses into the network. Hence, PE devices should 
   have methods to limit the number of MAC addresses learned from a 
   given port. 
    
    
2.0.8 Scaling 
    
   It is important that the many-to-many VMIS architecture is able to 
   support larger number of customers with each customer having 
   multiple sites that require many-to-many connectivity. The summation 
   of number of sites per customer over the number of customers 
   provides a benchmark for scaling. This benchmarking parameter is 
   defined as the "gold weight". The larger the "Gold Weight" the 
   better profit margin and growth of the business for Service 
   Providers. 
    
2.0.9 Service provisioning 
    
   Based on the transport layer mechanism that is deployed it may be 
   required to perform service provisioning along the path taken 
   between the site. If there is a need for larger customer base with 
   complex requirements, manual provisioning may be administratively 
   prohibitive. In such a situation, use of automatic discovery and 
   signaling protocols facilitates network management. Any automatic 
   signaling of provisioning must have the ability to scale across a 
   global network and affect all the providers involved (hierarchical 
   switching would provide this solution). Additionally, the signaling 
   layer must have visibility into path creation to enforce any 
   constrains required.  
    
      
2.0.10 End point discovery 
    
   End points of participating sites may be required to establish the 
   transport layer connectivity. These end-points may be either 
   manually configured or learned via some routing protocol. OSPF 
   Opaque LSA are one such popular protocol extension that is used to 
   learn end points of the participating devices. [4] Presents how OSPF 
   Opaque LSA may be used to discover different Layer 2 reachability.

2.0.11 Virtual Service Provisioning 
    
   A customer may wish to perform his own assignments and 
   administration of the addressing, including layer VLAN tagging. 
   Customers ability to perform such administration, creates a truly 
   Virtual Enterprise network extension. All the building blocks in the 
   VMI architecture, including the transport layer, need to participate 
   in order to build a VMI service with virtual service provisioning 
   requirement. A customer's VLAN tag must be able to be encapsulated 
   in the transport layer mechanism, to provide transparency. 
    
2.0.12 Address Transparency 
    
   An end user considers a VMI to be a totally transparent network. 
   Packets, headers and payload, are transferred unaltered.  Broadcast, 
   and multicast addresses are recognized and treated accordingly. VLAN 
   tags are preserved, if present. 
    
2.0.13 Class of Service 
    
   A VMI recognizes a range of traffic categories.  The categories have 
   significance only within a given VMI.  The availability and 
   allocation of different traffic categories is defined by a Service 
   Level Agreement and enforced by the Providers VMI Infrastructure. 
    
2.0.14 Class of Service Classification 
    
   A VMI distinguishes guaranteed delivery traffic and best effort 
   traffic. Within each of these two categories, one or more priorities 
   can be further distinguished.  The guaranteed category of traffic 
   may also allocate particular latency and jitter commitments to one 
   of its stated priorities. 
    
   The Provider∆s VMI Infrastructure implements a traffic 
   classification filter that allocates end users traffic to each 
   category based on pre-determined SLA. 
    
   The classification and enforcement is significant only within a VMI. 
    
2.0.15 Bandwidth Allocation and Policing 
    
   The amount of traffic bandwidth allowed to flow within a VMI, total 
   as well as for each traffic category, is determined by a SLA 
   agreement.  The provider implements traffic policing mechanisms to 
   enforce the SLA. 
    
   For the traffic coming into the Provider∆s network, the maximum 
   bandwidth limits are enforced.  The end user may implement traffic 
   shaping mechanisms to avoid unnecessary packet drops. 
    
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                        12 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   For the traffic leaving the Provider∆s network, the maximum 
   bandwidth limits are enforced.  The Provider may offer a back-off 
   signaling mechanism to aide traffic shaping for the source. 
    
2.0.16 End User Packet immunity 
    
   VMI services do not rely on the global uniqueness of end users  
   addresses, such as MAC addresses, or any addresses. Of course, the 
   addresses must remain consistent within each VMI for useful service.  
   Nevertheless, the Provider∆s infrastructure is immune to the End 
   User misaddressed, invalid, corrupted, or maliciously altered 
   packets. 
    
2.0.17 Packet Loss Reports 
    
   A VMI service provides an integrated packet loss reporting system 
   for signaling legitimate packet drops.  A legitimate packet drop is 
   defined as a discard of an end user∆s packet for reasons other than 
   network failure. The typical reasons are: 
 
   o Source rate higher than VMI SLA 
   o Destination VMI SLA below source rate 
   o Destination flooded by traffic from many sources 
   o Best effort congestion 
 
   Packet drops due to network failures are not reported.  A packet 
   drop due to congestion for a guaranteed traffic is considered a 
   failure. 
    
2.0.18 Zero Cost Service Access 
    
   A VMI service is offered to the end user without a need for any 
   devices located on the end user premises.  This is called zero cost 
   service access, the Provider can provision and modify the service 
   without the need to install or modify any equipment on the customer 
   premises.  A physical connectivity means, e.g. a fiber cable, must 
   exist. 
    
2.0.19. Internet Gateway Function 
    
   A VMI is quintessentially a private network service. The Internet 
   gateway function is a Provider side facility which allows to tie a 
   VMI to the Internet at large.  This is applicable only to IP 
   traffic. 
    
2.0.20 Service Gateway Function 
    
   Similarly, the Service gateway function is a Provider side facility 
   which allows the Provider to inject extra services to a VMI which 
   otherwise remains private.  It could be used for offering  popular 
   IP services such as DNS, DHCP, etc. 
    
2.0.21 Service Instantiation 
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                        13 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
    
   It is possible to create several instances of VMI service 
   infrastructures sharing the same equipment within a network 
   provider.  For example different wavelength can be dedicated to 
   different VMI service instances in a WDM systems. Similarly, SONET 
   transport system can be partitioned based on STS-1 frames for 
   different VMI systems.  This capability extends wholesale 
   opportunities for Providers. 
    
2.0.22 Service Infrastructure Configuration 
    
   The infrastructure for VMI services, the base of the Tower of Hanoi, 
   is a collection of a wide range of network equipment. Typically, a 
   combination of SNMP, TL1, and CLI tools are used for setting this 
   equipment up. It is beyond the scope of this draft to define what 
   tools should be used for this purpose. 
    
2.0.23 Service Operations Management 
    
   The operations of VMI services are managed through a set of 
   directory based protocols and servers.  The equipment participating 
   in the VMI operations pulls the necessary service parameters and 
   configuration from directory based servers. This function represents 
   the pin in the Tower of Hanoi. 
    
2.0.24 Service Gradation 
    
   Not all VMI deployments will support all VMI features.  If certain 
   features are not supported by the infrastructure, the related SLAs 
   would denote these exceptions.  For example, it is conceivable that 
   in certain situation, the infrastructure would not be redundant but 
   still provide useful, perhaps less expensive, VMI service.  
   Similarly, guaranteed service may not be offered by many 
   infrastructures but the remaining best effort service could still be 
   offered as a VMI service.  
    
   It is useful to list major gradation of VMI service capabilities 
    
   o High or standard reliability 
   o Ability to offer guaranteed service 
   o Limited distance scope or global reach 
   o Internet gateway function availability 
   o Service gateway function availability 
   o Packet drop reporting 
   o Traffic encryption or simple separation 
         
   Conversely, it is useful to list the minimum set of capabilities 
    
   o L2 private network service 
   o Full support for L2 unicast, broadcast and multicast 
   o Preservation of L2 headers, including VLAN tags if present 
   o Ingress/Egress bandwidth policing 
   o Full end user traffic separation

   o Full MAC address space independence 
    
    
3.0 VMI Network Model: point-to-multipoint or hub and spoke model 
    
   The point-to-multi-point model is subset of multi-point-to-multi-
   point model that was presented earlier. Point-to-multi-point model 
   may be used by services that requires connectivity to a centralized 
   site from several remote sites. Such a service is very similar to 
   more traditional frame relay deployment. Unlike, frame relay 
   networks, VMI point-to-multi-point network may provide, additional 
   services that were beyond the capability of classical frame relay 
   networks.  
    
   The point-to-multi-point VMI deployment model may be used either as 
   address transparent model or routable model. In the address 
   transparent model, customers may consider the VMI as a virtual and 
   transparent extension to their Local Network, or in other words, VMI 
   infrastructure appears as a physical connection. In the routable 
   model the VMI access points may be considered as belong to the same 
   sub-network. Thus VMI edge devices providing routing functionality. 
   However, customers may wish to maintain there private address space 
   shielded from the VMI control plane. In the same time, VMI service 
   providers may not wish to maintain customer address space. As such, 
   VMI infrastructure may require to have technologies that could 
   transport customer's traffic using some local addressing and 
   transport mechanisms.  
    
3.0.1 Transparent Deployment 
    
   The Transparent point-to-multi-point deployment model is mainly used 
   by the customers who wish to extend the Local Network over the VMI 
   without any network layer address translation. In other words; all 
   the sites appears as access point in the same Local Network. 
    
   Due to the anatomy of the point-to-multipoint network edge devices 
   that provide interface between the customer sites may require to 
   implement specific forwarding policies. In more traditional frame 
   relay networks; when deploying hub and spoke models; concepts such 
   as split horizon may be implemented to prevent reflection of 
   broadcast traffic. However when providing transparent deployment 
   model customers may wish to have connectivity from remote site to a 
   remote site.  Cost concern customers who do not wish to purchase 
   fully meshed many-to-many network and yet achieve many-to-many 
   reachability may also use point-to-multi-point deployment. VMI 
   service providers who wish to offer transparent deployment model 
   MUST have forwarding policies defined to properly forward inter-site 
   traffic. A simple such policy is to treat each virtual connection as 
   a separate circuit. A more complex forwarding policies may require 
   to be defined if all the virtual links to be treated like a single 
   interface and yet achieve inter-site forwarding. 
    
3.0.2 Routable model 
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                        15 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
    
   In the routable model the VMI access points may be considered as 
   belonging to the same sub-network. Thus VMI edge devices providing 
   routing functionality. However, customers may wish to maintain their 
   private address space shielded from the VMI control plane. In the 
   same time, VMI service providers may not wish to maintain customer 
   address space. As such, VMI infrastructure may require having 
   technologies that could transport customer's traffic using some 
   local addressing and transport mechanisms.  
    
3.0.3 QoS and Traffic Engineering  
    
   There are two QoS and traffic models used in point-to-multipoint 
   deployments. The remote sites maintain the same QoS and Traffic 
   model as the point-to-point deployment and the issues, and 
   requirements are similar. The central site or the hub site is 
   analogues to a site in many-to-many network. Hence, the issues, 
   requirements and solutions are similar to that of many-to-many 
   deployment model. 
    
3.0.4 Broadcast and Multicast 
    
   Broadcast and multicast forwarding issues are different at remote 
   sites and hub site. At the remote sites the forwarding policies are 
   similar to those applied in point-to-point networks. At the hub site 
   forwarding policies becomes more complex based on whether remote-
   site to-remote site connectivity needed and whether transparent 
   deployment model or routable model is in place. Such forwarding 
   polices may be include as part of the Service Level Agreement (SLA). 
    
3.0.5 Scaling 
    
   For the VMI service providers point-to-multi point model give a 
   better "Gold weight" (Gold Weight is defined in section 2.0.8) as 
   compared to many-to-many networks. This is mainly due to reduction 
   in number of circuits that are deployed in the core. Such spare 
   connections may be sold to other customers. In the perspective of 
   customers; they may save lots of dollars if connectivity between 
   significantly larger amount of sites are needed. However if customer 
   requires inter site connectivity in a point-to-multipoint deployment 
   then VMI service provide is required to define and apply some 
   complex set of forwarding policies. VMI service providers may charge 
   extra for such specialized service policies. On the other hand, VMI 
   service providers may require supporting large amount of such 
   policies if they wish to increase the rate of return or the "Gold 
   Weight". 
    
    
3.0.6 Redundancy 
    
   Providing redundancy in point-to-multipoint deployments may be much 
   simpler than many-to-many deployment model. It is anticipated that 
   when purchasing a SLA, the redundancy is specified for the entire 
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                        16 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   VMI service rather than per site basis. Hence provisioning such 
   redundancy in a many-to-many network may cause serious complexities 
   and expenses to the VMI service providers. On the other hand, in 
   point to multipoint deployment scenarios redundancy is required to 
   be provided between the hub site and the remote sites. Thus offered 
   SLA may be cheaper for the customer and administratively simpler for 
   the VMI service 
    
4.0 VMI Network Model: point-to-point network model 
    
   The point-to-point network model is the simplest of all VMI network 
   models. Due to its simplicity, point-to-point model can be used to 
   provide variety of service that could not be provisioned using other 
   service models. As an example, providing video or voice services 
   require strict end-to-end timing. Providing such end-to-end timing 
   using other service models may not be possible. In order to better 
   discuss the requirements and issues in point-to-point networks, in 
   this document, VMI services are broadly classified in to two 
   categories. 
 
   1. The VMI services that require data services, either in packet or 
   cell form are called Data service VMI (DSVMI). 
    
   2. The VMI service that require emulation of some characteristics of 
   a transport media, such as SONET are called, in this document, 
   Circuit Emulation VMI (CEVMI). 
    
   The point-to-point VMI service is different to tradition VPN in 
   several fronts. The Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are considered a 
   transport method between two end points. Where as point-to-point VMI 
   services are a service provided between two end points. The service 
   provided may not limited to data only. In traditional VPN, 
   redundancy, reconfiguration etc were the responsibility of the end 
   users. In the point-to-point VMI services such services are provided 
   by the VMI service provider and may be part of the Service Level 
   Agreement (SLA). Most traditional VPN services are IP centric. 
   Whereas VMI services are not only protocol agnostic it can also 
   provide virtual extensions to different Layer 1 circuit such as TDM 
   circuits. The VMI services are considered to be extension to the 
   Local Network. Where as VPN are considered an Inter Network 
   connection. Thus certain requirements, such as QoS, in VMI require 
   being of the same level as Local Area Network, where as such 
   requirements may be considered in terms of Wide Area Network 
   Perspective in VPN. 
    
4.0.1 QoS and Traffic Engineering Requirements 
    
   The QoS and Traffic engineering service in Data Service VMI is to 
   provide end-to-end QoS and Traffic Engineering requirements as per 
   the SLA.  The Service provider may offer several flavors of SLA with 
   different QoS and Traffic Engineering characteristics. Or Service 
   Provider may customize the SLA around the customer business needs. 
   In either case VMI infrastructure is require to have capabilities to 
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                        17 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   cater for these different QoS and Traffic Engineering need. These 
   capabilities include the Transport Layer, Network Management and end 
   equipment. 
    
   The QoS and Traffic Engineering service in Circuit emulation VMI 
   (CEVMI) may require satisfying different Traffic Engineering 
   parameters than Data Service VMI (DSVMI). Exact set of parameters 
   depends on the Type of circuit emulation service offered and 
   customer requirements. As an example, if the ATM circuits are 
   emulated customer may wish to have only UBR service or CBR service. 
   Another example is a customer who wishes to extend Frame Relay 
   network over the VMI. When offering Circuit Emulation services, 
   transport protocol in the VMI core should be capable of satisfying 
   different requirements of different categories of circuits. 
    
   Customers who wish to extend transparently connect two 
   geographically dispersed data networks may choose DSVMI. They may 
   wish to consider the extension transparent to the users, in terms of 
   latency, delays etc.. As such SLA may require VMI service providers 
   to offer QoS and Traffic Engineering characteristics as in the Local 
   Networks. 
    
4.0.2 Reliability 
    
   The customers who purchase VMI services may request the VMI service 
   provider to support the needed Reliability. The method of providing 
   the required reliability level depends on several factors. Firstly, 
   the SLA specifies the required reliability parameters such as fail 
   over time and accepted data loss. Secondly, the type of VMI service 
   that is needed. As an example, methods for providing reliability 
   service for Circuit Emulation VMI (CEVMI) may be different from 
   methods for providing Data Service VMI (DSVMI). When providing 
   certain Circuit Emulation VMI, providers are required to maintain 
   timing requirements.  
    
4.0.3 Data Security and Authentication 
    
   The security solution for point-to-point VMI depends on the type of 
   VMI service provided. Hence, the security solution provided for 
   DSVMI may be different from the CEVMI. Within the DSVMI, based on 
   the payload types different security solution may be needed. As an 
   example, when transporting IP only payloads one may choose IP Sec 
   solution whereas when transporting Layer 2 payloads, service 
   providers may require to provide a security solution that is 
   protocol agnostic. On the other hand some customers may wish to have 
   an on premise security solution. Specially, CEVMI customers may use 
   a front-end scramblers/encrypters. 
    
4.0.4 Transport Mechanism in the Core 
    
   The choice of the proper transport mechanism depends on the 
   requirements of the SLA and the technology.  
    
  
Senevirathne, et.al.      Expires-July 2001                        18 
 
                        draft-vmi-frame-00.txt            January 2001 
 
   When providing CEVMI the transport layer should be able to tunnel 
   the circuits over the VMI infrastructure. The transport layer in the 
   VMI core should be capable of supporting, end-to-end timing, and 
   emulation of Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) circuits. Generalized 
   MPLS presented in [], provide a solution based on MPLS. Chosen 
   Transport method should be able to provide, required reliability, 
   end-to-end timing, service provisioning etc, as agreed upon the SLA.  
  
   When providing DSVMI, at least, following issue are required to be 
   taken into consideration to select a Transport Mechanism; end-to-end 
   QoS, type of payload (Layer 2/ IP), reliability, reconfiguration. 
    
4.0.5 Service Provisioning 
    
   Based on the Service Level agreement, it may be required to provide 
   end-end service provisioning. Service provisioning in point-to-point 
   networks may be simpler than many-to-many networks. However, when 
   maintaining large customer base such manual configurations may be 
   administratively prohibitive. It may be beneficial to have some 
   automatic service provisioning methods. The automatic service 
   provisioning may appear as either a signaling protocol (such a RSVP-
   TE) or system wide network management system. 
     
    
5.0 Providing VMI for Geographically Distributed Sites 
    
   In general, VMIs are intended for connectivity between sites located 
   within a metropolitan reach. However the notion of metropolitan 
   reach may not necessarily imply geographic proximity.  Geographic 
   distances may vary significantly, in many cases exceeding the limits 
   of the underlying technologies used to build the VMI infrastructure. 
   In these cases, additional technologies may be employed for the sole 
   purpose of spanning wide geographic distances.  These technologies 
   are called long haul. 
    
    
5.1 Native Long Haul 
    
   Here, we define Native Long Haul as the ability to extend the 
   geographic reach  while keeping the same, common infrastructure and 
   preserving the service management of the original local network. 
   Referring to the analogy of the Tower of Hanoi, if the base of the 
   tower and its pin remain the same, the long haul extension is 
   native.. As an example, if the local network is based on optical 
   technology and if there exists an optical technology based means to 
   connect the sites that are located outside the local domain, but 
   comprise the same infrastructure and are managed by the same 
   operations system, that is considered a native long haul. On the 
   other hand if the sites are connected using some other technology 
   (such as frame relay_in the otherwise all Ethernet network) then it 
   is considered a non-native long haul.

   Native long haul may not be well suited for all network models. When 
   connecting sites that require many-to-many connectivity then native 
   long haul may not be financially viable. On the other hand if the 
   network model is point-to-multipoint (hub and spoke) and there are 
   only relatively few sites that requires longer geographic reach, 
   then native long haul is financially viable and technologically 
   feasible. 
    
    
5.2 Non-native long haul 
    
   It is possible to extend the geographic reach using non-native long 
   haul methods. However, these methods must meet the same requirements 
   applicable to native methods, such as end-to-end traffic 
   engineering, reliability etc.  
    
5.3 Hierarchical Interconnection model 
    
   In some situations, like many-to-may connectivity model, native long 
   reach may not be feasible. The hierarchical interconnection model 
   presented here provides a method to achieve VMI service across 
   geographically dispersed site. Here we assume that there is a remote 
   service provider that has agreed to participate in VMI services.

   Sample Hierarchical Interconnection model 
    
   Above diagram depicts a hierarchical interconnection model. The 
   local confederates are the more traditional VMI service providers. 
   The first level POP connects multiple of local confederates. 
   collection of local confederates that are below a single first level 
   pop is considered as a "UNION". The Unions are interconnected using 
   second level POP. 
    
5.3.1 Transport Layer 
    
   The transport layer method outside the confederates should be able 
   to provide required services. This may include, but not limited to, 
   end to end traffic engineering, tunneling of non-native data, 
   reliability and resilience. In order to have a non-fragmented 
   consistent network service, all devices are required to support 
   common and adequate transport layer mechanism. MPLS appears to be a 
   promising choice for this environment. However, this document does 
   not limit the scope of selection of such transport layer methods. 
    
5.3.2 Layer 2 Address Learning 
    
   In the above hierarchical Internetwork model, the device outside the 
   local confederate should not perform forwarding based on customer 
   MAC addresses. Instead, when providing layer 2 services, forwarding 
   should be performed using some other mechanism. In other words, 
   devices outside the local confederate provide tunneling services. 
    
5.3.3 Reliability 
    
   The reliability of the local confederate depends on the chosen VMI 
   model and SLA. The devices outside the local confederate should be 
   able to provide required reliability. This may include the equipment 
   level and transport layer level. 
    
5.3.4 Scalability 
    
   The network topology outside the local confederate requires to scale 
   to potentially large amount of inter site transit tunnels and 
   traffic. 
    
5.3.5 Administration 
    
   With the type of diversity in the hierarchical interconnection 
   model, it is possible that the local confederates belong to 
   different autonomous systems. Hence, the routing, control plane and 
   discovery should have knowledge of the inter AS nature. 
    
5.3.6 Accounting 
    
   There should be a comprehensive accounting system so customers can 
   be eventually charged properly. Flat service model or bandwidth 
   wholesale may not work well in the hierarchical network model.

5.3.7 Service Provisioning and end-point discovery 
    
   Due to the diversity of end points, system wide network provisioning 
   may be administratively prohibitive. It may be better if the 
   provisioning is performed at the end points and control protocol or 
   signaling method be used to automatically provision the service 
   requirements. A good example for this is MPLS RSVP-TE and CR-LDP. On 
   the other hand it is important to discover the endpoints. This may 
   be achieved either using IGP or some EGP protocol. [4] presents how 
   end points may be discovered using OPSF opaque LSA. [5] presents how 
   these discoveries are done across Autonomous Systems using BGP-MP 
   extensions.   
    
5.3.8 Virtual Service Provisioning 
    
   Some customers require a SLA that allows self-provisioning and 
   administration of the inter site VMI. Virtual Service provisioning 
   requires that all-participating providers and equipment has 
   capabilities to support Virtual Provisioning. Supporting such a SLA 
   in a multi-vendor, multi-owner, geographically dispersed 
   infrastructure may be a difficult task. As such it is anticipated, 
   at least for now, Virtual Service Provisioning may not be available 
   in hierarchical inter-connection model.
