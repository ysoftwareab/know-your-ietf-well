1.  Introduction

   BGP Large Communities [RFC8092] provide a mechanism to signal opaque
   information between Autonomous Systems.  This document presents a set
   of examples of how Large BGP Communities could be employed by an
   operator to achieve various goals.  This document draws from
   experience in Operational Communities such as NANOG [1] and NLNOG
   [2].

   The opaque nature of BGP Large Communities allows for rapid
   deployment of new features or changes to the product.  Operators are
   encouraged to publicly publish and maintain documentation of the
   purpose of each Large BGP Community, both informational and action,
   that they support or are visible in looking glasses.

Internet-Draft       Usage of BGP Large Communities        February 2017


2.  The Generic Design Pattern

   BGP Large Communities are composed of a 4-octet Global Administrator
   field followed by two 4-octet Local Data fields.  Large BGP
   Communities are compose three 4-octet fields.  The first is the
   Global Administrator field, whose value is the ASN of AS that has
   defined the meaning of the remaining two 4-octet fields, the Local
   Data fields.  This document describes an approach defining these
   fields as "ASN:Function:Parameter"-approach to fill the three fields.

   In deployments of both BGP Communities [RFC1997] and BGP Large
   Communities, two categories of Communities exist:

   o  Informational Communities

   o  Action Communities

   For each, ideas are provided regarding the contents of each of the
   three fields in BGP Large Communities.

   Throughout the document a topology of four Autonomous Systems is used
   to illustrate the usage of Communities in the following
   configuration:

           AS 65551
               |
               ^
               |
           AS 64497
             /  \
            ^    \
           /      ^
      AS 64498     \
          |        |
          `<->- AS 64499

   AS 64497 obtains transit services from AS 65551, a 32-bit ASN.  AS
   64497 provides transit services to both AS 64498 and AS 64499.  AS
   64498 and AS 64499 maintain a peering relationship in which they only
   exchange their customer routes.

2.1.  Informational Communities

   Informational Communites are labels for attributes such as origin of
   the route announcement, the relation with the EBGP neighbor or for
   instance the intended propagation audience.  Informational
   Communities also assist in network operations such as debugging.

Internet-Draft       Usage of BGP Large Communities        February 2017


   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is marking the
   routes with the Informational Communities.  For example, AS 64497
   might add a community with the GA 64497 to a route learned from an
   iBGP or eBGP peer that means that the route was learned from or
   originated by a device in the Netherlands.

   In general the intended audience of Informational Communities are
   downstream networks and the Global Administrator itself, but any
   Autonomous System could benefit from receiving these communities.

2.2.  Action Communities

   Action Communities are attached to routes to request non-default
   behaviour in this, a conferation or an external AS.  Action
   Communities could be used to change the route's propagation
   characteristics, the LOCAL_PREFENCE or the number of AS_PATH prepends
   to add when exporting or importing a route.

   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is expected to
   perform the action.  For instance, AS 64499 might add a Large
   Community with the GA 64497 to signal AS 64497 to perform an action
   upon that route.

   In general the intended audience of Action Communities is an upstream
   provider, but realistically could be any AS willing to act upon it.

3.  Examples of Informational Communities

3.1.  Location

   AS 64497 can inform its downstream networks about the geographical
   entity where AS 64497 learned a route by marking the route with BGP
   Large Communities following one or a combination of the following
   schemes.

3.1.1.  An ISO 3166-1 numeric function

   AS 64497 could assign a value of 1 to the first Local Data field to
   designate the function of the second Local Data field as ISO-3166-1
   numeric country identifiers.

   designate the function of the parameter in the second Local Data

   regions, geographical sub-regions, or selected economic and other
   groupings following a set of published identifiers by the United

3.2.  Relation

   showing the relation with the EBGP neighbor from whom the route was
   received.

4.3.  Location based manipulation of LOCAL_PREF

   In some cases, it can be desirable for an autonomous system to allow
   adjacent Autonomous Systems to directly influence the degree of
   preference associated with a route, usually expressed within the
   LOCAL_PREF attribute.

   Furthermore, in the case of large networks spanning significant
   geography, it is often also useful to be able to extend this



Snijders, et al.         Expires August 20, 2017                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Usage of BGP Large Communities        February 2017


   capability and scope its effect to a geographic region.  This is a
   more powerful mechanism than AS_PATH prepending, but since degree of
   preference determines BGP route selection and thus onward
   advertisement, it can also be self-limiting in its scope.

   Since the LOCAL_PREF attribute which influences degree of preference
   is locally significant within each autonomous system, it is not
   usually practical or useful to compare LOCAL_PREF attribute values
   between autonomous systems.  Instead it can be useful to classify the
   major types of route likely to exist within an autonomous system's
   routing hierarchy and provide an ability to set one's route to that
   preference:

   o  A qualified customer route.  Usually the highest preference.

   o  A peer, or network-share, route.  A co-operating network provider
      engaged in a partnership for customer coverage ("peering").

   o  A last resort, or backup route.

   It is entirely possible that some providers may have more classes of
   route preference but it is possible to codify both the route
   preference class and the regional scope within the Local Data fields
   of the Large Community attribute.

   For example, AS64497 might establish the following function
   identifiers to set route preference class, which could allow pairing
   with a location or peer-based operand to determine scope.

       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | Function | Preference Class                              |
       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       |    10    | Qualified customer route. Highest preference. |
       |    15    | Peering partner. Median preference.           |
       |    19    | Route of last resort. Lowest preference.      |
       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+

             Table 8: Action: Preference Function Identifiers

   Once established, these route preference setting functions can be
   linked with a scoping operand such as per-peer or per-location based
   identifiers in order to provide AS64497's customers with a
   comprehensive and rich toolset to influence route preference.

             Table 9: Action: Regional Preference Communities

   Since the degree of preference influences BGP best path selection
   (which in turn influences onward route propagation) Operators should
   take special care with a traffic engineering tool such as location
   based local preference influence (BGP Wedgies [RFC4264]).

5.  Security Considerations

   Network operators should note the recommendations in Section 11 of
   BGP Operations and Security [RFC7454].

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
