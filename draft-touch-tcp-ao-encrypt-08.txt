Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the TCP Authentication
   Option (TCP-AO) to encrypt the TCP segment payload in addition to
   providing TCP-AO's authentication of the payload, TCP header, and IP
   pseudoheader. This extension augments how the packet contents and
   headers are processed and which keys are derived, and adds a
   capability for in-band coordination of unauthenticated Diffie-
   Hellman key exchange at connection establishment. The extension
   preserves key rollover coordination and protection of long-lived
   connections.

1. Introduction

   This document describes an extension to the TCP Authentication
   Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] called TCP-AO-ENC to support its use to
   encrypt TCP segment payload contents in addition to authenticating
   the segment. TCP-AO-ENC is intended for use where TCP user data
   privacy is required and where TCP control protocol protection is
   also needed.

Internet-Draft        TCP-AO Payload Encryption            January 2018


   TCP-AO-ENC supports two different modes: authenticated encryption
   and unauthenticated (BTNS-style) encryption [RFC5387]. Authenticated
   mode (ENC-AUTH) relies on out-of-band coordination of master key
   tuples in the same way as TCP-AO, and protects all segments of a
   connection. Unauthenticated (ENC-BTNS) mode supports in-band
   unsigned Diffie-Hellman key exchange during the initial SYN, and
   protects connections from all except man-in-the-middle attacks
   during connection establishment.

   This document assumes detailed familiarity with TCP-AO [RFC5925].
   TCP-AO-ENC extends how TCP-AO generates traffic keys and how those
   keys are used to process TCP segment headers and payloads, but does
   not otherwise alter other aspects of the TCP-AO mechanism [RFC5926].

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].
   When used in lower case, these words have their conventional meaning
   and do not convey the interpretations in RFC-2119.

3. Background

   The premise of TCP-AO-ENC is that it might be useful to allow TCP-AO
   to encrypt TCP segment payloads, in addition to authenticating the
   entire segment.

   This is accomplished by the following additions, as a preview:

   o  An encryption flag to indicate when segment payload encryption is
      used.

   o  Traffic encryption key, in addition to the TCP-AO traffic
      (authentication) key. TCP-AO-ENC can be used with only symmetric
      ciphers that avoiding the need for padding (stream ciphers).

   o  Augment input and output processing to include
      encryption/decryption.

   TCP-AO-ENC does not change any other aspects of TCP-AO [RFC5925],
   and is compatible with TCP-AO-NAT [RFC6978]. TCP-AO-NAT is intended
   for use only where coordinated between endpoints for connections
   that match the shared Master Key Tuple (MKT) parameters, as with all
   other MKT parameters.

4. Authenticated and Unauthenticated Modes

   TCP-AO-ENC includes two modes: authenticated (ENC-AUTH) and
   unauthenticated (ENC-BTNS). The latter is consistent with the
   "Better Than Nothing Security" approach to protect communication in
   the absence of public key infrastructure (PKI) or pre-shared keys
   [RFC5387].

   ENC-AUTH mode operates in the same way as original TCP-AO
   authentication, by relying on out-of-band Master Key Tuples (MKTs)
   that are deployed in advance of new connections. All segments of
   connections covered by ENC-AUTH are encrypted and authenticated
   using keying material derived from those MKTs.

   ENC-BTNS mode can be used without an out-of-band key exchange
   protocol. It exchanges unauthenticated, unsigned Diffie-Hellman
   nonces during connection establishment in-band, and uses that
   information to derive keys used to protect the remainder of the
   connection. ENC-BTNS mode is susceptible to man-in-the-middle
   attacks in which the adversary both participates in the initial
   nonce exchange and processes subsequent segments; this protection
   increases the effort of the attacker and can help avoid low-effort
   DDOS attacks that disrupt established connections [RFC4953].

   Because ENC-BTNS uses in-band nonce exchange only during the initial
   SYN, TCP-AO key rollover is not used in that mode. The KeyIDs used
   during the nonce exchange are recorded and used throughout the
   connection.

5. Extension for Payload Encryption

   The following describe the additions to TCP-AO needed to support
   TCP-AO-ENC.

5.1. Additional Master Key Tuple components

   TCP-AO-ENC augments the MKT as follows; as with other MKT
   components, these MUST NOT change during a connection:

   o  TCP encryption mode.  This indicates the use and mode (ENC-AUTH
      or ENC-BTNS) of segment payload encryption, or is clear when
      encryption is not used (e.g., for conventional TCP-AO).

   o  Encryption Key Derivation Function (E-KDF).  Indicates the key
      derivation function and its parameters, as used to generate
      traffic encryption keys from master keys in the same way that the
      TCP-AO KDG generates traffic (authentication) keys.

Internet-Draft        TCP-AO Payload Encryption            January 2018


   o  Encryption algorithm.  Indicates the encryption algorithm and its
      parameters as used for encrypted connections.

   PTCP-AO-ENC processes TCP packets in the same way as TCP-AO, except
   that it replaces the authentication input and output processing as
   follows:

5.2. Additional traffic keys

   TCP-AO-ENC uses the E-KDF to derive four additional keys used for
   traffic encryption:

   o  Send_SYN_traffic_encryption_key

   o  Receive_SYN_traffic_encryption_key

   o  Send_other_traffic_encryption_key

   o  Receive_other_traffic_encryption_key

5.3. Per-Connection TCP-AO Parameters

   The per-connection TCP-AO parameters are not affected by the use of
   TCP-AO-ENC-AUTH, except that MKTs indicated by Current_key and
   Rnext_key would indicate the use of payload encryption.

   The per-connection TCP-AO parameters for TCP-AO-ENC-BTNS are
   augmented by the addition of the following Diffie-Hellman nonces:

   o  Send_nonce. The locally-generated Diffie-Hellman nonce.

   o  Receive_nonce. The Diffie-Hellman nonce generated by the remote
      end of the connection.

   These nonces are exchanged during the initial SYN exchange in ENC-
   BTNS mode; for ENC-AUTH mode, similar information is exchanged out-
   of-band and is used to derive the encryption keys. KeyIDs used with
   these nonces are recorded during nonce exchange and used for the
   remainder of the connection.

   The use of payload encryption as specified in these MKTs SHOULD NOT
   change during a TCP connection.

Internet-Draft        TCP-AO Payload Encryption            January 2018


5.4. Traffic Encryption Key Derivation Functions

   Traffic encryption keys are derived from the MKTs using the E-KDF,
   in the same way and used on the same segments as their corresponding
   authentication keys, e.g.:

   o  Send_SYN_traffic_encryption_key / Send_SYN_traffic_key

   o  Receive_SYN_traffic_encryption_key / Receive_SYN_traffic__key

   o  Send_other_traffic_encryption_key / Send_other_traffic__key

   o  Receive_other_traffic_encryption_key / Receive_other_traffic_key

6. TCP-AO-ENC Interaction with TCP

   TCP-AO-ENC augments TCP segment send and receive processing to
   include encryption/decryption. Note that the encryption
   initialization vector MAY depend on TCP header state, but MUST NOT
   depend on the processing of previous segments because segments may
   arrive (and need to be decrypted) out of order.

6.1. Sending TCP Segments

   For ENC-BTNS, initial SYN and SYN-ACK are used to establish the
   Diffie-Hellman nonces as follows:

   o  Initial SYN and SYN-ACK. The initial SYN (SYN and not ACK) and
      SYN-ACK segments are not encrypted or authenticated. Instead,
      their HMAC field contains the Diffie-Hellman nonce in network-
      standard byte order.

   The size of the Diffie-Hellman nonce determines the strength of the
   resulting association. For TCP, such nonces are limited to the
   available option space in the SYN and SYN-ACK segments. This
   currently limits the nonce to 128 bits (16 bytes). Larger nonces can
   be supported using extensions to expand the TCP SYN option space
   [Bo14][Br14][To18].

   Because these segments are not authenticated or encrypted, they
   SHOULD NOT contain user data. In a typical client-server system,
   user data usually commences in other segments anyway.

   All other TCP segments are processed as follows:

   1. The segment payload is encrypted in-place using the traffic
      encryption key.

Internet-Draft        TCP-AO Payload Encryption            January 2018


   2. The segment is authenticated using TCP-AO as per [RFC5925].

6.2. Receiving TCP Segments

   For ENC-BTNS, initial SYN and SYN-ACK are used to establish the
   Diffie-Hellman nonces as follows:

   o  Initial SYN and SYN-ACK. The unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman nonce
      is extracted from the HMAC field, and used to construct the
      encryption and traffic keys for the connection. Because these
      segments are not encrypted or authenticated, no further
      processing is required.

   All other incoming TCP segments are processed as follows:

   1. TCP-AO authenticates the segment, including discarding it if
      authentication fails, as per [RFC5925].

   2. The segment payload is decrypted in-place using the traffic
      encryption key.

6.3. Other TCP Impact

   TCP-AO-ENC has no impact on TCP beyond that of TCP-AO, including
   impact on TCP header size, connectionless resets, and ICMP handling.

   TCP-AO-ENC is compatible with the use of TCP-AO-NAT if traversal of
   NAT boxes is desired.

7. Security Considerations

   TCP-AO-ENC augments TCP-AO to provide segment payload privacy.

   TCP-AO-ENC relies on TCP-AO's authentication to avoid replay attacks
   and to ensure that the segments originate from the intended source.

   TCP-AO-ENC supports only stream ciphers because the TCP segment must
   be encrypted and decrypted in-situ. Support for padding would
   require additional option space to indicate the original message
   length, and this complication does not seem necessary.

   The design of TCP-AO-ENC can support either symmetric or asymmetric
   keys. However, because TCP-AO derives traffic (authentication) keys
   from MKTs using KDFs, it was deemed sufficient that TCP-AO-ENC
   derive traffic encryption keys from MKTs using E-KDFs in a similar
   manner, and both endpoints would thus derive the same traffic
   encryption keys just as they derive the same traffic

   (authentication) keys. Extensions of TCP-AO-ENC to support
   asymmetric keying are possible if traffic keys are managed using an
   out-of-band mechanism, but not if they are derived from MKTs.

   ENC-AUTH has no additional security considerations. ENC-BTNS cannot
   authenticate or encrypt the segments used for nonce exchange, i.e.,
   the initial SYN and SYN-ACK. As a result, ENC-BTNS is susceptible to
   man-in-the-middle attacks during connection establishment, but
   remains useful to ensure that established connections are protected.

8. Keying Algorithms

   TCP-AO-ENC algorithms are specified in a separate document, as was
   the custom for TCP-AO.

   NOTES [for that doc]:

   o  E-KDF - also, can a MKT use the same alg for KDF and E-KDF?

   o  Encryption algorithm - possibilities include AES CTR (CTR initial
      value can be the ESN) or AES CBC and Camellia CBC as per TLS 1.2.

9. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document. This section can
   be removed upon publication as an RFC.
