Abstract

   Recent proposals have extended the scope of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to encompass
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.

   The requirement for a simple and efficient mechanism that can be
   used to detect data plane failures in point-to-point (P2P) MPLS LSPs
   has been recognised and has led to the development of techniques
   for fault detection and isolation commonly referred to as "LSP Ping".

   The scope of this document is fault detection and isolation for P2MP
   MPLS LSPs. This documents does not replace any of the mechanism of
   LSP Ping, but clarifies their applicability to MPLS P2MP LSPs, and
   extends the techniques and mechanisms of LSP Ping to the MPLS P2MP
   environment.

1. Introduction

   Simple and efficient mechanisms that can be used to detect data plane
   failures in point-to-point (P2P) MPLS LSP are described in
   [RFC4379]. The techniques involve information carried in an MPLS

   "echo request" and "echo reply", and mechanisms for transporting the
   echo reply. The echo request and reply messages provide sufficient
   information to check correct operation of the data plane, as well as
   a mechanism to verify the data plane against the control plane, and
   thereby localize faults. The use of reliable reply channels for echo
   request messages as described in [RFC4379] enables more robust fault
   isolation. This collection of mechanisms is commonly referred to as
   "LSP Ping".

   The requirements for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS traffic
   engineered (TE) LSPs are stated in [RFC4461]. [P2MP-RSVP] specifies a
   signaling solution for establishing P2MP MPLS TE LSPs.

   The requirements for point-to-multipoint extensions to the Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) are stated in [P2MP-LDP-REQ]. [P2MP-LDP]
   specifies extensions to LDP for P2MP MPLS.

   P2MP MPLS LSPs are at least as vulnerable to data plane faults or to
   discrepancies between the control and data planes as their P2P
   counterparts. Mechanisms are, therefore, desirable to detect such
   data plane faults in P2MP MPLS LSPs as described in [RFC4687].

   This document extends the techniques described in [RFC4379] such
   that they may be applied to P2MP MPLS LSPs and so that they can be
   used to bootstrap other OAM procedures such as [MCAST-CV]. This
   document stresses the reuse of existing LSP Ping mechanisms used for
   P2P LSPs, and applies them to P2MP MPLS LSPs in order to simplify
   implementation and network operation.

1.1 Design Considerations

   An important consideration for designing LSP Ping for P2MP MPLS LSPs
   is that every attempt is made to use or extend existing mechanisms
   rather than invent new mechanisms.

   As for P2P LSPs, a critical requirement is that the echo request
   messages follow the same data path that normal MPLS packets would
   traverse. However, it can be seen this notion needs to be extended
   for P2MP MPLS LSPs, as in this case an MPLS packet is replicated so
   that it arrives at each egress (or leaf) of the P2MP tree.

   MPLS echo requests are meant primarily to validate the data plane,
   and they can then be used to validate data plane state against the
   control plane. They may also be used to bootsrap other OAM procedures

Yasukawa and Farrel                                             [Page 4]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   such as [MPLS-BFD] and [MCAST-CV]. As pointed out in [RFC4379],
   mechanisms to check the liveness, function, and consistency of the
   control plane are valuable, but such mechanisms are not a feature of
   LSP Ping and are not covered in this document.

   As is described in [RFC4379], to avoid potential Denial of Service
   attacks, it is RECOMMENDED to regulate the LSP Ping traffic passed to
   the control plane. A rate limiter should be applied to the well-known
   UDP port defined for use by LSP Ping traffic.

2. Notes on Motivation

2.1. Basic Motivations for LSP Ping

   The motivations listed in [RFC4379] are reproduced here for
   completeness.

   When an LSP fails to deliver user traffic, the failure cannot always
   be detected by the MPLS control plane. There is a need to provide a
   tool that would enable users to detect such traffic "black holes" or
   misrouting within a reasonable period of time; and a mechanism to
   isolate faults.

   [RFC4379] describes a mechanism that accomplishes these goals. This
   mechanism is modeled after the ping/traceroute paradigm: ping (ICMP
   echo request [RFC792]) is used for connectivity checks, and
   traceroute is used for hop-by-hop fault localization as well as path
   tracing. [RFC4379] specifies a "ping mode" and a "traceroute" mode
   for testing MPLS LSPs.

   The basic idea as expressed in [RFC4379] is to test that the packets
   that belong to a particular Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
   actually end their MPLS path on an LSR that is an egress for that
   FEC. [RFC4379] achieves this test by sending a packet (called an
   "MPLS echo request") along the same data path as other packets
   belonging to this FEC. An MPLS echo request also carries information
   about the FEC whose MPLS path is being verified. This echo request is
   forwarded just like any other packet belonging to that FEC. In "ping"
   mode (basic connectivity check), the packet should reach the end of
   the path, at which point it is sent to the control plane of the
   egress LSR, which then verifies that it is indeed an egress for the
   FEC. In "traceroute" mode (fault isolation), the packet is sent to
   the control plane of each transit LSR, which performs various checks
   that it is indeed a transit LSR for this path; this LSR also returns
   further information that helps to check the control plane against the
   data plane, i.e., that forwarding matches what the routing protocols
   determined as the path.

   One way these tools can be used is to periodically ping a FEC to
   ensure connectivity.  If the ping fails, one can then initiate a

Yasukawa and Farrel                                             [Page 5]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   traceroute to determine where the fault lies.  One can also
   periodically traceroute FECs to verify that forwarding matches the
   control plane; however, this places a greater burden on transit LSRs
   and thus should be used with caution.

2.2. Motivations for LSP Ping for P2MP LSPs

   As stated in [RFC4687], MPLS has been extended to encompass P2MP
   LSPs. As with P2P MPLS LSPs, the requirement to detect, handle and
   diagnose control and data plane defects is critical. For operators
   deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs the detection and
   specification of how to handle those defects is important because
   such defects may affect the fundamentals of an MPLS network, but also
   because they may impact service level specification commitments for
   customers of their network.

   P2MP LDP [P2MP-LDP] uses the Label Distribution Protocol to establish
   multicast LSPs. These LSPs distribute data from a single source to
   one or more destinations across the network according to the next
   hops indicated by the routing protocols. Each LSP is identified by an
   MPLS multicast FEC.

   P2MP MPLS TE LSPs [P2MP-RSVP] may be viewed as MPLS tunnels with a
   single ingress and multiple egresses. The tunnels, built on P2MP
   LSPs, are explicitly routed through the network. There is no concept
   or applicability of a FEC in the context of a P2MP MPLS TE LSP.

   MPLS packets inserted at the ingress of a P2MP LSP are delivered
   equally (barring faults) to all egresses. In consequence, the basic
   idea of LSP Ping for P2MP MPLS TE LSPs may be expressed as an
   intention to test that packets that enter (at the ingress) a
   particular P2MP LSP actually end their MPLS path on the LSRs that are
   the (intended) egresses for that LSP. The idea may be extended to
   check selectively that such packets reach specific egresses.

   The technique in this document makes this test by sending an LSP Ping
   echo request message along the same data path as the MPLS packets. An
   echo request also carries the identification of the P2MP MPLS LSP
   (multicast LSP or P2MP TE LSP) that it is testing. The echo request
   is forwarded just as any other packet using that LSP and so is
   replicated at branch points of the LSP and should be delivered to all
   egresses. In "ping" mode (basic connectivity check), the echo request
   should reach the end of the path, at which point it is sent to the
   control plane of the egress LSRs, which verify that they are indeed
   an egress (leaf) of the P2MP LSP. An echo response message is sent by
   an egress to the ingress to confirm the successful receipt (or
   announce the erroneous arrival) of the echo request.

   In "traceroute" mode (fault isolation), the echo request is sent to
   the control plane at each transit LSR, and the control plane checks

Yasukawa and Farrel                                             [Page 6]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   that it is indeed a transit LSR for this P2MP MPLS LSP. The transit
   LSR also returns information on an echo response that helps verify
   the control plane against the data plane. That is, the information
   is used by the ingress to check that the data plane forwarding
   matches what is signaled by the control plane.

   P2MP MPLS LSPs may have many egresses, and it is not necessarily the
   intention of the initiator of the ping or traceroute operation to
   collect information about the connectivity or path to all egresses.
   Indeed, in the event of pinging all egresses of a large P2MP MPLS
   LSP, it might be expected that a large number of echo responses would
   arrive at the ingress independently but at approximately the same
   time. Under some circumstances this might cause congestion at or
   around the ingress LSR. Therefore, the procedures described in this
   document provide a mechanism that allows the responders to randomly
   delay (or jitter) their responses so that the chances of swamping the
   ingress are reduced.

   Further, the procedures in this document allow the initiator to limit
   the scope of an LSP Ping echo request (ping or traceroute mode) to
   one specific intended egress or a set of egresses.

   The scalability issues surrounding LSP Ping for P2MP MPLS LSPs may be
   addressed by other mechanisms such as [MCAST-CV] that utilise the LSP
   Ping procedures in this document to provide bootstrapping mechanisms
   as described in Section 2.3.

   LSP Ping can be used to periodically ping a P2MP MPLS LSP to ensure
   connectivity to any or all of the egresses. If the ping fails,
   the operator or an automated process can then initiate a traceroute
   to determine where the fault is located within the network. A
   traceroute may also be used periodically to verify that data plane
   forwarding matches the control plane state; however, this places an
   increased burden on transit LSRs and should be used infrequently and
   with caution.

2.3 Bootstrapping other OAM Procedures using LSP Ping

   [MPLS-BFD] describes a process where LSP Ping [RFC4379] is used to
   bootstrap the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) mechanism
   [BFD] for use to track the liveliness of an MPLS LSP. In particular
   BFD can be used to detect a data plane failure in the forwarding
   path of an MPLS LSP.

   Requirements for MPLS P2MP LSPs extend to hundreds or even thousands
   of endpoints. If a protocol required explicit acknowledgments to
   each probe for connectivity verification, the response load at the
   root would be overwhelming.

   A more scalable approach to monitoring P2MP LSP connectivity is

Yasukawa and Farrel                                             [Page 7]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   desribed in [MCAST-CV]. It relies on using the MPLS Echo
   Request/Response messages of LSP Ping [RFC4379] to bootstrap the
   monitoring mechanism in a manner similar to [MPLS-BFD]. The actual
   monitoring is done using a separate process defined in [MCAST-CV].

   Note that while the approach described in [MCAST-CV] was developed in
   response to the multicast scalability problem, it can be applied to
   P2P LSPs as well.

3. Operation of LSP Ping for a P2MP LSP

   This section describes how LSP Ping is applied to P2MP MPLS LSPs.
   It covers the mechanisms and protocol fields applicable to both ping
   mode and traceroute mode. It explains the responsibilities of the
   initiator (ingress), transit LSRs and receivers (egresses).

3.1. Identifying the LSP Under Test

3.1.1. Identifying a P2MP MPLS TE LSP

   [RFC4379] defines how an MPLS TE LSP under test may be identified in
   an echo request. A Target FEC Stack TLV is used to carry either an
   RSVP IPv4 Session or an RSVP IPv6 Session sub-TLV.

   In order to identify the P2MP MPLS TE LSP under test, the echo
   request message MUST carry a Target FEC Stack TLV, and this MUST
   carry exactly one of two new sub-TLVs: either an RSVP P2MP IPv4
   Session or an RSVP P2MP IPv6 Session sub-TLV. These sub-TLVs carry
   fields from the RSVP-TE P2MP Session and Sender-Template objects
   [P2MP-RSVP] and so provide sufficient information to uniquely
   identify the LSP.

   The new sub-TLVs are assigned sub-type identifiers as follows, and
   are described in the following sections.

      Sub-Type #       Length              Value Field
      ----------       ------              -----------
             TBD         20                RSVP P2MP IPv4 Session
             TBD         56                RSVP P2MP IPv6 Session

3.1.1.1. RSVP P2MP IPv4 Session Sub-TLV

   The format of the RSVP P2MP IPv4 Session Sub-TLV value field is
   specified in the following figure. The value fields are taken from
   the definitions of the P2MP IPv4 LSP Session Object, and the P2MP
   IPv4 Sender-Template Object in [P2MP-RSVP]. Note that the Sub-Group
   ID of the Sender-Template is not required.

3.1.2. Identifying a Multicast LDP LSP

   [RFC4379] defines how a P2P LDP LSP under test may be identified in
   an echo request. A Target FEC Stack TLV is used to carry one or more
   Sub-TLVs (for example, an IPv4 Prefix FEC Sub-TLV) that identify the
   LSP.

   In order to identify a multicast LDP LSP under test, the echo request

   message MUST carry a Target FEC Stack TLV, and this MUST carry
   exactly one new sub-TLVs: the Multicast LDP FEC Stack Sub-TLV. This
   Sub-TLVs fields from the multicast LDP messages [P2MP-LDP] and so
   provides sufficient information to uniquely identify the LSP.

   The new sub-TLV is assigned a sub-type identifier as follows, and
   is described in the following sections.

      Sub-Type #       Length              Value Field

   Address Family

      A two octet quantity containing a value from ADDRESS FAMILY
      NUMBERS in [IANA-PORT] that encodes the address family for the
      Root LSR Address.

   Address Length

      The length of the Root LSR Address in octets.

   Root LSR Address

      An address of the LSR at the root of the P2MP LSP encoded
      according to the Address Family field.

   Opaque Length

       The length of the Opaque Value, in octets.

   Opaque Value

      An opaque value elements of which uniquely identifies the P2MP LSP
      in the context of the Root LSR.

   If the Address Family is IPv4, the Address Length MUST be 4. If the
   Address Family is IPv6, the Address Length MUST be 16. No other
   Address Family values are defined at present.

3.2. Ping Mode Operation

3.2.1. Controlling Responses to LSP Pings

   As described in Section 2.2, it may be desirable to restrict the
   operation of LSP Ping to a single egress. Since echo requests are
   forwarded through the data plane without interception by the control
   plane (compare with traceroute mode), there is no facility to limit
   the propagation of echo requests, and they will automatically be
   forwarded to all (reachable) egresses.

   However, the intended egress under test can be identified by the
   inclusion of a P2MP Egress Identifier TLV containing an IPv4 P2MP
   Egress Identifier sub-TLV or an IPv6 P2MP Egress Identifier sub-TLV.
   The P2MP Egress Identifier TLV SHOULD contain precisely one sub-TLV.
   If the TLV contains no sub-TLVs it SHOULD be processed as if the
   whole TLV were absent (causing all egresses to respond as described
   below). If the TLV contains more than one sub-TLV, the first MUST be
   precessed as described in this document, and subsequent sub-TLVs
   SHOULD be ignored.

   An initiator may indicate that it wishes all egresses to respond to
   an echo request by omitting the P2MP Egress Identifier TLV.

   Note that the ingress of a multicast LDP LSP will not know the
   identities of the egresses of the LSP except by some external means
   such as running P2MP LSP Ping to all egresses.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

3.2.2. Ping Mode Egress Procedures

   An egress LSR is RECOMMENDED to rate limit its receipt of echo
   request messages as described in [RFC4379]. After rate limiting, an
   egress LSR that receives an echo request carrying an RSVP P2MP IPv4
   Session sub-TLV, an RSVP P2MP IPv6 Session sub-TLV, or a Multicast
   LDP FEC Stack Sub-TLV MUST determine whether it is an intended egress
   of the P2MP LSP in question by checking with the control plane. If it
   is not supposed to be an egress, it MUST respond according to the
   setting of the Response Type field in the echo message following the
   rules defined in [RFC4379].

   If the egress LSR that receives an echo request and allows it through
   its rate limiting is an intended egress of the P2MP LSP, the LSR MUST
   check to see whether it is an intended Ping recipient. If a P2MP
   Egress Identifier TLV is present and contains an address that
   indicates any address that is local to the LSR, the LSR MUST respond
   according to the setting of the Response Type field in the echo
   message following the rules defined in [RFC4379]. If the P2MP Egress
   Identifier TLV is present, but does not identify the egress LSR, it
   MUST NOT respond to the echo request. If the P2MP Egress Identifier
   TLV is not present (or, in the error case, is present but does not
   a sub-TLVs), but the egress LSR that received the echo request is an
   intended egress of the LSP, the LSR MUST respond according to the
   setting of the Response Type field in the echo message following the
   rules defined in [RFC4379].

3.2.3. Jittered Responses

   The initiator (ingress) of a ping request MAY request the responding
   egress to introduce a random delay (or jitter) before sending the
   response. The randomness of the delay allows the responses from
   multiple egresses to be spread over a time period. Thus this
   technique is particularly relevant when the entire LSP tree is being
   pinged since it helps prevent the ingress (or nearby routers) from
   being swamped by responses, or from discarding responses due to rate
   limits that have been applied.

   It is desirable for the ingress to be able to control the bounds
   within which the egress delays the response. If the tree size is
   small only a small amount of jitter is required, but if the tree is
   large greater jitter is needed. The ingress informs the egresses of
   the jitter bound by supplying a value in a new TLV (the Echo Jitter
   TLV) carried on the Echo request message. If this TLV is present,
   the responding egress MUST delay sending a response for a random
   amount of time between zero seconds and the value indicated in the
   TLV. If the TLV is absent, the responding egress SHOULD NOT introduce
   any additional delay in responding to the echo request.

   LSP ping SHOULD NOT be used to attempt to measure the round-trip

Yasukawa and Farrel                                            [Page 12]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   time for data delivery. This is because the LSPs are unidirectional,
   and the echo response is often sent back through the control plane.
   The timestamp fields in the echo request/response MAY be used to
   deduce some information about delivery times and particularly the
   variance in delivery times.

   The use of echo jittering does not change the processes for gaining
   information, but note that the responding egress MUST set the value
   in the Timestamp Received fields before applying any delay.

   It is RECOMMENDED that echo response jittering is not used except in
   the case of P2MP LSPs. If the Echo Jitter TLV is present in an echo
   request for any other type of TLV, the responding egress MAY apply
   the jitter behavior described here.

3.2.4. P2MP Egress Identifier TLV and Sub-TLVs

   A new TLV is defined for inclusion in the Echo request message.

   The P2MP Egress Identifier TLV is assigned the TLV type value TBD and
   is encoded as follows.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Type = TBD (P2MP Egress ID TLV)|       Length = Variable       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                          Sub-TLVs                             ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Sub-TLVs:

        Zero, one or more sub-TLVs as defined below.

        If no sub-TLVs are present, the TLV MUST be processed as if it
        were absent. If more than one sub-TLV is present the first MUST
        be processed as described in this document, and subsequent
        sub-TLVs SHOULD be ignored.

   The P2MP Egress Identifier TLV only has meaning on an echo request
   message. If present on an echo response message, it SHOULD be
   ignored.

   Two Sub-TLVs are defined for inclusion in the P2MP Egress Identifier
   TLV carried on the echo request message. These are:

      Sub-Type #       Length              Value Field
      ----------       ------              -----------
              1             4              IPv4 P2MP Egress Identifier
              2            16              IPv6 P2MP Egress Identifier

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007


   The value of an IPv4 P2MP Egress Identifier consists of four octets
   of an IPv4 address. The IPv4 address is in network byte order.

   The value of an IPv6 P2MP Egress Identifier consists of sixteen
   octets of an IPv6 address. The IPv6 address is in network byte order.

3.2.5. Echo Jitter TLV

   A new TLV is defined for inclusion in the Echo request message.

   The Echo Jitter TLV is assigned the TLV type value TBD and is encoded
   as follows.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type = TBD (Jitter TLV)  |          Length = 4           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                          Jitter time                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Jitter time:

        This field specifies the upper bound of the jitter period that
        should be applied by a responding egress to determine how long
        to wait before sending an echo response. An egress SHOULD wait
        a random amount of time between zero seconds and the value
        specified in this field.

        Jitter time is specified in milliseconds.

   The Echo Jitter TLV only has meaning on an echo request message. If
   present on an echo response message, it SHOULD be ignored.

3.3. Traceroute Mode Operation

   The traceroute mode of operation is described in [RFC4379]. Like
   other traceroute operations, it relies on the expiration of the TTL
   of the packet that carries the echo request. Echo requests may
   include a Downstream Mapping TLV, and when the TTL expires the echo
   request is passed to the control plane on the transit LSR which
   responds according to the Response Type in the message. A responding
   LSR fills in the fields of the Downstream Mapping TLV to indicate the
   downstream interfaces and labels used by the reported LSP from the
   responding LSR. In this way, by successively sending out echo
   requests with increasing TTLs, the ingress may gain a picture of the
   path and resources used by an LSP up to the point of failure when no
   response is received, or an error response is generated by an LSR
   where the control plane does not expect to be handling the LSP.

Yasukawa and Farrel                                            [Page 14]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   This mode of operation is equally applicable to P2MP MPLS TE LSPs
   as described in the following sections.

   The traceroute mode can be applied to all destinations of the P2MP
   tree just as in the ping mode. In the case of P2MP MPLS TE LSPs, the
   traceroute mode can also be applied to individual destinations
   identified by the presence of a P2MP Egress Identifier TLV. However,
   since a transit LSR of a multicast LDP LSP is unable to determine
   whether it lies on the path to any one destination, the traceroute
   mode limited to specific egresses of such an LSP MUST NOT be used.

   In the absence of a P2MP Egress Identifier TLV, the echo request is
   asking for traceroute information applicable to all egresses.

   The echo response jitter technique described for the ping mode is
   equally applicable to the traceroute mode and is not additionally
   described in the procedures below.

3.3.1. Traceroute Responses at Non-Branch Nodes

   When the TTL for the MPLS packet carrying an echo request expires the
   packet MUST be passed to the control plane as specified in [RFC4379].

   If the LSP under test is a multicast LDP LSP and if the echo request
   carries a P2MP Egress Identifier TLV the LSR MUST treat the echo
   request as malformed and MUST process it according to the rules
   specified in [RFC4379].

   Otherwise, the LSR MUST NOT return an echo response unless the
   responding LSR lies on the path of the P2MP LSP to the egress
   identified by the P2MP Egress Identifier TLV carried on the request,
   or if no such Sub-TLV is present.

   If sent, the echo response MUST identifiy the next hop of the path of
   the LSP in the data plane by including a Downstream Mapping TLV as
   described in [RFC4379].

3.3.1.1. Correlating Traceroute Responses

   When traceroute is being simultaneously applied to multiple egresses,
   it is important that the ingress should be able to correlate the echo
   responses with the branches in the P2MP tree. Without this
   information the ingress will be unable to determine the correct
   ordering of transit nodes. One possibility is for the ingress to poll
   the path to each egress in turn, but this may be inefficient,
   undesirable, or (in the case of multicast LDP LSPs) illegal.

   The Downstream Mapping TLV that MUST be included in the echo response
   indicates the next hop from each responding LSR, and this information
   supplied by a non-branch LSR can be pieced together by the ingress to

Yasukawa and Farrel                                            [Page 15]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   reconstruct the P2MP tree although it may be necessary to refer to
   the routing information distributed by the IGP to correlate next hop
   addresses and LSR reporting addresses in subsequent echo responses.

   In order to facilitate more easy correlation of echo responses, the
   Downstream Mapping TLV can also contain Multipath Information as
   described in [RFC4379] to identify to which egress/egresses the echo
   response applies, and indicates. This information:

   - MUST NOT be present for multicast LDP LSPs

   - SHOULD be present for P2MP MPLS TE LSPs when the echo request
     applies to all egresses

   - is RECCOMMENDED to be present for P2MP MPLS TE LSPs when the echo
     request is limited to a single egress.

   The format of the information in the Downstream Mapping TLV for
   P2MP MPLS LSPs is described in section 3.3.5 and 3.3.6.

3.3.2.  Traceroute Responses at Branch Nodes

   A branch node may need to identify more than one downstream interface
   in a traceroute echo response if some of the egresses that are being
   traced lie on different branches. This will always be the case for
   any branch node if all egresses are being traced.

   [RFC4379] describes how multiple Downstream Mapping TLVs should be
   included in an echo response, each identifying exactly one downstream
   interface that is applicable to the LSP.

   A branch node MUST follow the procedures described in Section 3.3.1
   to determine whether it should respond to an echo request. The branch
   node MUST add a Downstream Mapping TLV to the echo response for each
   outgoing branch that it reports, but it MUST NOT report branches that
   do not lie on the path to one of the destinations being traced. Thus
   a branch node may sometimes only need to respond with a single
   Downstream Mapping TLV, for example, consider the case where the
   traceroute is directed to only a single egress node. Therefore,
   the presence of only one Downstream Mapping TLV in an echo response
   does not guarantee that the reporting LSR is not a branch node.

   To report on the fact that an LSR is a branch node for the P2MP MPLS
   LSP a new B-flag is added to the Downstream Mapping TLV. The flag is
   set to zero to indicate that the reporting LSR is not a branch for
   this LSP, and is set to one to indicate that it is a branch. The flag
   is placed in the fourth byte of the TLV that was previously reserved.

   The format of the information in the Downstream Mapping TLV for
   P2MP MPLS LSPs is described in section 3.3.5 and 3.3.6.

3.3.2.1. Correlating Traceroute Responses

   Just as with non-branches, it is important that the echo responses
   from branch nodes provide correlation information that will allow the
   ingress to work out to which branch of the LSP the response applies.

   The P2MP tree can be determined by the ingress using the identity of
   the reporting node and the next hop information from the previous
   echo response, just as with echo responses from non-branch nodes.

   As with non-branch nodes, in order to facilitate more easy
   correlation of echo responses, the Downstream Mapping TLV can also
   contain Multipath Information as described in [RFC4379] to identify
   to which egress/egresses the echo response applies, and indicates.
   This information:

   - MUST NOT be present for multicast LDP LSPs

   - SHOULD be present for P2MP MPLS TE LSPs when the echo request
     applies to all egresses

   - is RECCOMMENDED to be present for P2MP MPLS TE LSPs when the echo
     request is limited to a single egress.

   The format of the information in the Downstream Mapping TLV for
   P2MP MPLS LSPs is described in section 3.3.5 and 3.3.6.

3.3.3. Traceroute Responses at Bud Nodes

   Some nodes on a P2MP MPLS LSP may be egresses, but also have
   downstream LSRs. Such LSRs are known as bud nodes [RFC4461].

   A bud node MUST respond to a traceroute echo request just as a branch
   node would, but it MUST also indicates to the ingress that it is an
   egress in its own right. This is achieved through the use of a new
   E-flag in the Downstream Mapping TLV that indicates that the
   reporting LSR is not a bud for this LSP (cleared to zero) or is a bud
   (set to one). A normal egress MUST NOT set this flag.

   The flag is placed in the fourth byte of the TLV that was previously
   reserved.

3.3.4. Non-Response to Traceroute Echo Requests

   The nature of P2MP MPLS TE LSPs in the data plane means that
   traceroute echo requests may be delivered to the control plane of
   LSRs that must not reply to the request because, although they lie
   on the P2MP tree, they do not lie on the path to the egress that is
   being traced.


Yasukawa and Farrel                                            [Page 17]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

   Thus, an LSR on a P2MP MPLS LSP MUST NOT respond to an echo request
   when the TTL has expired if any of the following applies:

   - The Reply Type indicates that no reply is required

   - There is a P2MP Egress Identifier TLV present on the echo request
     (which means that the LSP is a P2MP MPLS TE LSP), but the address
     does not identify an egress that is reached through this LSR for
     this particular P2MP MPLS LSP.

3.3.5. Modifications to the Downstream Mapping TLV

   A new B-flag is added to the Downstream Mapping TLV to indicate that
   the reporting LSR is not a branch for this LSP (cleared to zero) or
   is a branch (set to one).

   A new E-flag is added to the Downstream Mapping TLV to indicate that
   the reporting LSR is not a bud node for this LSP (cleared to zero) or
   is a bud node (set to one).

   The flags are placed in the fourth byte of the TLV that was
   previously reserved as shown below. All other fields are unchanged
   from their definitions in [RFC4379] except for the additional

3.3.6. Additions to Downstream Mapping Multipath Information

      A new value for the Multipath Type is defined to indicate that the
      reported Multipath Information applies to a P2MP MPLS TE LSP and
      may contain a list of egress identifiers that indicate the egress
      nodes that can be reached through the reported interface. This
      Multipath Type MUST NOT be used for a multicast LDP LSP.

      Type #    Address Type          Multipath Information
      ---       ----------------      ---------------------
      TBD       P2MP egresses         List of P2MP egresses

      Note that a list of egresses may include IPv4 and IPv6 identifiers
      since these may be mixed in the P2MP MPLS TE LSP.

      The Multipath Length field continues to identify the length of the
      Multipath Information just as in [RFC4379] (that is, not including
      the downstream labels), and the downstream label (or potential
      stack thereof) is also handled just as in [RFC4379]. The format
      of the Multipath Information for a Multipath Type of P2MP Egresses
      is as follows.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      Address Type

        This field indicates whether the egress address that follows is
        an IPv4 or IPv6 address, and so implicitly encodes the length of
        the address.

        Two values are defined and mirror the values used in the Address
        Type field of the Downstream Mapping TLV itself.

          Type #        Address Type
          ------        ------------
               1        IPv4
               3        IPv6

      Egress Address

        An egress of this P2MP MPLS TE LSP that is reached through the

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

        interface indicated by the Downstream Mapping TLV and for which
        the traceroute echo request was enquiring.

4. Operation of LSP Ping for Bootstrapping Other OAM Mechanisms

   Bootstrapping of other OAM procedures can be achieved using the
   MPLS Echo Request/Response messages. The LSP(s) under test are
   identified using the RSVP P2MP IPv4 or IPv6 Session Sub-TLVs
   (see Section 3.1.1) or the Multicast LDP FEC Stack Sub-TLV
   (see Section 3.1.2).

   Other Sub-TLVs may be defined in other specifications to indicate
   the OAM procedures being bootstrapped, and to describe the bootstrap
   parameters. Further details of the bootstrapping processes and the
   bootstrapped OAM processes are described in other documents. For
   example, see [MPLS-BFD] and [MCAST-CV].

5. Non-compliant Routers

   If an egress for a P2MP LSP does not support MPLS LSP ping, then no
   reply will be sent, resulting in a "false negative" result. There is
   no protection for this situation, and operators may wish to ensure
   that end points for P2MP LSPs are all equally capable of supporting
   this function. Alternatively, the traceroute option can be used to
   verify the LSP nearly all the way to the egress, leaving the final
   hop to be verified manually.

   If, in "traceroute" mode, a transit LSR does not support LSP ping,
   then no reply will be forthcoming from that LSR for some TTL, say n.
   The LSR originating the echo request SHOULD continue to send echo
   requests with TTL=n+1, n+2, ..., n+k in the hope that some transit
   LSR further downstream may support MPLS echo requests and reply. In
   such a case, the echo request for TTL > n MUST NOT have Downstream
   Mapping TLVs, until a reply is received with a Downstream Mapping.

   Note that the settings of the new bit flags in the Downstream Mapping
   TLV are such that a legacy LSR would return them with value zero
   which most closely matches the likely default behavior of a legacy
   LSR.

6. OAM Considerations

   The procedures in this document provide OAM functions for P2MP MPLS
   LSPs and may be used to enable bootstrapping of other OAM procedures.

   In order to be fully operational several considerations must be made.

   - Scaling concerns dictate that only cautious use of LSP Ping should
     be made. In particular, sending an LSP Ping to all egresses of a
     P2MP MPLS LSP could result in congestion at or near the ingress

Yasukawa and Farrel                                            [Page 20]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping-04.txt       March 2007

     when the responses arrive.

     Further, incautious use of timers to generate LSP Ping echo
     requests either in ping mode or especially in traceroute may lead
     to significant degradation of network performance.

   - Management interfaces should allow an operator full control over
     the operation of LSP Ping. In particular, it SHOULD provide the
     ability to limit the scope of an LSP Ping echo request for a P2MP
     MPLS LSP to a single egress.

     Such an interface SHOULD also provide the ability to disable all
     active LSP Ping operations to provide a quick escape if the network
     becomes congested.

   - A MIB module is required for the control and management of LSP Ping
     operations, and to enable the reported information to be inspected.

     There is no reason to believe this should not be a simple extension
     of the LSP Ping MIB module used for P2P LSPs.

7. IANA Considerations

7.1. New Sub-TLV Types

   Three new Sub-TLV types are defined for inclusion within the LSP Ping
   [RFC4379] Target FEC Stack TLV (TLV type 1).

   IANA is requested to assign sub-type values to the following
   Sub-TLVs from the Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Parameters - TLVs registry.

     RSVP P2MP IPv4 Session (see Section 3.1.1)
     RSVP P2MP IPv6 Session (see Section 3.1.1)
     Multicast LDP FEC Stack (see Section 3.1.2)

7.2. New Multipath Type

   Section 3.3 of [RFC4379] defines a set of values for the LSP Ping
   Multipath Type. These values are currently not tracked by IANA.

   A new value for the LSP Ping Multipath Type is defined in Section
   3.3.6 of this document to indicate that the reported Multipath
   Information applies to a P2MP MPLS TE LSP.

   IANA is requested to create a new registry as follows:

   Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) - Multipath Types

            addresses

    A suggested value of xx is TBD by the MPLS Working Group.

    New values from this registry are to be assigned only by Standards
    Action.

7.3. New TLVs

   Two new LSP Ping TLV types are defined for inclusion in LSP Ping
   messages.

   IANA is reuqested to assign a new value from the Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Architecture (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Parameters
   - TLVs registry as follows using a Standards Action value.

     P2MP Egress Identifier TLV (see Section 3.2.4)
       Two sub-TLVs are defined
       - Type 1: IPv4 P2MP Egress Identifier (see Section 3.2.4)
       - Type 2: IPv6 P2MP Egress Identifier (see Section 3.2.4)

     Echo Jitter TLV (see Section 3.2.5)

8. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security concerns over and above
   those described in [RFC4379]. Note that because of the scalability
   implications of many egresses to P2MP MPLS LSPs, there is a
   stronger concern to regulate the LSP Ping traffic passed to the
   control plane by the use of a rate limiter applied to the LSP Ping
   well-known UDP port. Note that this rate limiting might lead to
   false positives.
