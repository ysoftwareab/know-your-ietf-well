1.  Introduction

   The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension document
   set [RFC4952] [I-D.ietf-eai-smtpext] [I-D.ietf-eai-utf8headers]
   [I-D.ietf-eai-dsn] expands Email address structure, syntax and Email
   header format.  To avoid bouncing internationalized Email messages,
   the downgrading mechanism [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade] converts an
   internationalized message to a traditional Email message when a
   server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP extension.
   The downgraded message is a traditional Email message, except the
   message has "Downgraded-" header fields.

   A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist because
   the encoding defined in [RFC2047] is not exactly reversible and
   Received header field downgrading may remove FOR clause information.
   The restoration of the downgrading should be done once at the final
   destination of the downgraded message such as MUAs or IMAP servers.
   This document describes the restoration methods as displaying
   techniques in MUAs.

   This is an informational document and it does not supersede the
   referenced documents.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the EAI
   overview [RFC4952] or in [RFC2821][RFC2822], MIME documents [RFC2045]
   [RFC2047] [RFC2183] [RFC2231].

   This document depends on [I-D.ietf-eai-utf8headers] and
   [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade].  Key words used in these document are used
   in this document, too.

   The term "non-ASCII" is an UTF-8 string which contains at least one
   non-ASCII character.

   The term "address header field" is used for a header field which
   contains <mailbox> elements which is defined in [RFC2822].  "Address
   header fields" contain "From", "Sender", "Reply-To", "To", "Cc",
   "Bcc", "Resent-From", "Resent-Sender", "Resent-To", "Resent-Cc",
   "Return-Path" header fields.

   An "UTF8SMTP message" is an Email messages expanded by

   [I-D.ietf-eai-utf8headers].


3.  Displaying downgraded message

   Displaying downgraded message is mostly performed by MIME decoding
   according to [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].  Result of MIME decoding, the
   header of the message still contains Downgraded-*: header fields, but
   the header field bodies are MIME decoded.  These decoded
   "Downgraded-" header fields contain the original header field name
   and the original header field values.  The recipient can read them.
   But the recipient's MUA cannot use the original header fields
   automatically.

   Additionally, MUAs can process "Downgraded-" header fields.  It is
   described in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.

3.1.  Displaying technique 1

   MUAs may remove "Downgraded-" from decoded "Downgraded-" header
   fields' name.

   First, decode MIME encoded header fields and MIME body part header
   fields according to [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].

   Then, for each "Downgraded-" header field, generate new header field
   which field name is the original header field name and the field
   value is the decoded header field value, and replace the
   "Downgraded-" header field by the generated header field.

   Don't change "Downgraded-Mail-From" and "Downgraded-Rcpt-To" header
   fields because they do not have their original header fields.

   With this technique, the "address header fields" may be displayed
   twice, one is from downgraded header field and the other is from
   decoded "Downgraded-" header.

3.2.  Displaying technique 2

   MUAs may decode and re-generate the original header of the message.
   This technique may reconstruct the original message from the
   downgraded message.  But it is not guaranteed.

   This technique is implemented by the following steps.

Internet-Draft       Displaying Downgraded Messages        February 2008


   Step 1:   Select "Downgraded-" header fields whose original header
      field is an "address header field".  Target header fields are
      "Downgraded-From", "Downgraded-Sender", "Downgraded-Reply-To",
      "Downgraded-To", "Downgraded-Cc", "Downgraded-Bcc", "Downgraded-
      Resent-From", "Downgraded-Resent-Sender", "Downgraded-Resent-To",
      "Downgraded-Resent-Cc", and "Downgraded-Return-Path" header
      fields.

   Step 2:   Generate new header field which field name is the original
      header field name and the field value is the decoded header field
      value from the output of Step 1.

   Step 3:   Apply Email header fields downgrading defined in section 5
      of [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade] to the output of Step 2 without re-
      generating "Downgraded-" header fields.

   Step 4:   Compare the output of Step 3 and the original header
      fields.  If the same header fields exist for both the output and
      the original header fields, remove the same header fields from the
      original header fields.  This step outputs the original header
      fields which is modified by this step.  Before this comparison, a
      canonicalization described below is useful.

      1.  Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in
          [RFC2822].
      2.  Insert a space character before and after <mailbox-list>
          separator "," if there is no space character.
      3.  Insert a space character before and after <comment> if there
          is no space character.
      4.  Decode <encoded-word> whose charset is 'UTF-8'.
      5.  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters to a
          single space character.  WSP characters here include those
          before and after a line folding boundary.
      6.  Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header
          field value.
      7.  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the colon
          separating the header field name from the header field value.
          The colon separator MUST be retained.

   Step 5:   Finally, do 'Displaying technique 1' described in
      Section 3.1 to the output of Step 4.


4.  Security considerations

   Displaying downgraded message may break the header of the message.
   MUAs should have a function to read the original received message.
