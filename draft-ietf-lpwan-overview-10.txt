                      draft-ietf-lpwan-overview-10

Abstract

   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies with
   characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly
   very small packet and application layer data sizes and long battery
   life operation.  This memo is an informational overview of the set of
   LPWAN technologies being considered in the IETF and of the gaps that
   exist between the needs of those technologies and the goal of running
   IP in LPWANs.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides background material and an overview of the
   technologies being considered in the IETF's Low Power Wide-Area
   Networking (LPWAN) working group.  We also provide a gap analysis
   between the needs of these technologies and currently available IETF
   specifications.

   Most technologies in this space aim for similar goals of supporting
   large numbers of very low-cost, low-throughput devices with very-low
   power consumption, so that even battery-powered devices can be
   deployed for years.  LPWAN devices also tend to be constrained in
   their use of bandwidth, for example with limited frequencies being
   allowed to be used within limited duty-cycles (usually expressed as a
   percentage of time per-hour that the device is allowed to transmit.)
   And as the name implies, coverage of large areas is also a common
   goal.  So, by and large, the different technologies aim for
   deployment in very similar circumstances.

   What mainly distinguishes LPWANs from other constrained networks is
   that in LPWANs the balancing act related to power consumption/battery
   life, cost and bandwidth tends to prioritise doing better with
   respect to power and cost and we are more willing to live with
   extremely low bandwidth and constrained duty-cycles when making the
   various trade-offs required, in order to get the multiple-kilometre
   radio links implied by the "wide area" aspect of the LPWAN term.

   Existing pilot deployments have shown huge potential and created much
   industrial interest in these technologies.  As of today, essentially
   no LPWAN end-devices (other than for Wi-SUN) have IP capabilities.
   Connecting LPWANs to the Internet would provide significant benefits
   to these networks in terms of interoperability, application
   deployment, and management, among others.  The goal of the IETF LPWAN
   working group is to, where necessary, adapt IETF-defined protocols,
   addressing schemes and naming to this particular constrained
   environment.

   This document is largely the work of the people listed in Section 7.

2.  LPWAN Technologies

   This section provides an overview of the set of LPWAN technologies
   that are being considered in the LPWAN working group.  The text for
   each was mainly contributed by proponents of each technology.

   Note that this text is not intended to be normative in any sense, but
   simply to help the reader in finding the relevant layer 2
   specifications and in understanding how those integrate with IETF-
   defined technologies.  Similarly, there is no attempt here to set out
   the pros and cons of the relevant technologies.

   Note that some of the technology-specific drafts referenced below may
   have been updated since publication of this document.

2.1.  LoRaWAN

2.1.1.  Provenance and Documents

   LoRaWAN is an ISM-based wireless technology for long-range low-power
   low-data-rate applications developed by the LoRa Alliance, a
   membership consortium.  <https://www.lora-alliance.org/> This draft
   is based on version 1.0.2 [LoRaSpec] of the LoRa specification.  That
   specification is publicly available and has already seen several
   deployments across the globe.

2.1.2.  Characteristics

   LoRaWAN aims to support end-devices operating on a single battery for
   an extended period of time (e.g., 10 years or more), extended
   coverage through 155 dB maximum coupling loss, and reliable and
   efficient file download (as needed for remote software/firmware
   upgrade).

   LoRaWAN networks are typically organized in a star-of-stars topology
   in which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central
   "network server" in the backend.  Gateways are connected to the
   network server via IP links while end-devices use single-hop LoRaWAN
   communication that can be received at one or more gateways.
   Communication is generally bi-directional; uplink communication from
   end-devices to the network server is favored in terms of overall
   bandwidth availability.

   Figure 1 shows the entities involved in a LoRaWAN network.

   o  End-device: a LoRa client device, sometimes called a mote.
      Communicates with gateways.

   o  Gateway: a radio on the infrastructure-side, sometimes called a
      concentrator or base-station.  Communicates with end-devices and,
      via IP, with a network server.

   o  Network Server: The Network Server (NS) terminates the LoRaWAN MAC
      layer for the end-devices connected to the network.  It is the
      center of the star topology.

   o  Join Server: The Join Server (JS) is a server on the Internet side
      of an NS that processes join requests from an end-devices.

   o  Uplink message: refers to communications from an end-device to a
      network server or application via one or more gateways.

   o  Downlink message: refers to communications from a network server
      or application via one gateway to a single end-device or a group
      of end-devices (considering multicasting).

   o  Application: refers to application layer code both on the end-
      device and running "behind" the network server.  For LoRaWAN,
      there will generally only be one application running on most end-
      devices.  Interfaces between the network server and application
      are not further described here.

   In LoRaWAN networks, end-device transmissions may be received at
   multiple gateways, so during nominal operation a network server may
   see multiple instances of the same uplink message from an end-device.

   The LoRaWAN network infrastructure manages the data rate and RF
   output power for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive
   data rate (ADR) scheme.  End-devices may transmit on any channel
   allowed by local regulation at any time.

   LoRaWAN radios make use of industrial, scientific and medical (ISM)
   bands, for example, 433MHz and 868MHz within the European Union and
   915MHz in the Americas.

   The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every
   transmission to help make the system more robust to interference and/
   or to conform to local regulations.

   Figure 2 below shows that after a transmission slot a Class A device
   turns on its receiver for two short receive windows that are offset
   from the end of the transmission window.  End-devices can only
   transmit a subsequent uplink frame after the end of the associated
   receive windows.  When a device joins a LoRaWAN network, there are
   similar timeouts on parts of that process.

   Given the different regional requirements the detailed specification
   for the LoRaWAN physical layer (taking up more than 30 pages of the
   specification) is not reproduced here.  Instead and mainly to
   illustrate the kinds of issue encountered, in Table 1 we present some
   of the default settings for one ISM band (without fully explaining
   those here) and in Table 2 we describe maxima and minima for some
   parameters of interest to those defining ways to use IETF protocols
   over the LoRaWAN MAC layer.

   Note that in the case of the smallest frame size (19 octets), 8
   octets are required for LoRa MAC layer headers leaving only 11 octets
   for payload (including MAC layer options).  However, those settings
   do not apply for the join procedure - end-devices are required to use
   a channel and data rate that can send the 23-byte Join-request
   message for the join procedure.

   Uplink and downlink higher layer data is carried in a MACPayload.
   There is a concept of "ports" (an optional 8-bit value) to handle



Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018                [Page 7]

   different applications on an end-device.  Port zero is reserved for
   LoRaWAN specific messaging, such as the configuration of the end
   device's network parameters (available channels, data rates, ADR
   parameters, RX1/2 delay, etc.).

   In addition to carrying higher layer PDUs there are Join-Request and
   Join-Response (aka Join-Accept) messages for handling network access.
   And so-called "MAC commands" (see below) up to 15 bytes long can be
   piggybacked in an options field ("FOpts").

   There are a number of MAC commands for link and device status
   checking, ADR and duty-cycle negotiation, managing the RX windows and
   radio channel settings.  For example, the link check response message
   allows the network server (in response to a request from an end-
   device) to inform an end-device about the signal attenuation seen
   most recently at a gateway, and to also tell the end-device how many
   gateways received the corresponding link request MAC command.

   Some MAC commands are initiated by the network server.  For example,
   one command allows the network server to ask an end-device to reduce
   its duty-cycle to only use a proportion of the maximum allowed in a
   region.  Another allows the network server to query the end-device's
   power status with the response from the end-device specifying whether
   it has an external power source or is battery powered (in which case
   a relative battery level is also sent to the network server).

   In order to operate nominally on a LoRaWAN network, a device needs a
   32-bit device address, that is assigned when the device "joins" the
   network (see below for the join procedure) or that is pre-provisioned
   into the device.  In case of roaming devices, the device address is
   assigned based on the 24-bit network identifier (NetID) that is
   allocated to the network by the LoRa Alliance.  Non-roaming devices
   can be assigned device addresses by the network without relying on a
   LoRa Alliance-assigned NetID.

   End-devices are assumed to work with one or a quite limited number of
   applications, identified by a 64-bit AppEUI, which is assumed to be a
   registered IEEE EUI64 value.  In addition, a device needs to have two
   symmetric session keys, one for protecting network artifacts
   (port=0), the NwkSKey, and another for protecting application layer
   traffic, the AppSKey.  Both keys are used for 128-bit AES
   cryptographic operations.  So, one option is for an end-device to
   have all of the above, plus channel information, somehow
   (pre-)provisioned, in which case the end-device can simply start
   transmitting.  This is achievable in many cases via out-of-band means
   given the nature of LoRaWAN networks.  Table 3 summarizes these
   values.

   As an alternative, end-devices can use the LoRaWAN join procedure
   with a join server behind the NS in order to setup some of these
   values and dynamically gain access to the network.  To use the join
   procedure, an end-device must still know the AppEUI, and in addition,
   a different (long-term) symmetric key that is bound to the AppEUI -
   this is the application key (AppKey), and is distinct from the
   application session key (AppSKey).  The AppKey is required to be
   specific to the device, that is, each end-device should have a
   different AppKey value.  And finally, the end-device also needs a
   long-term identifier for itself, syntactically also an EUI-64, and
   known as the device EUI or DevEUI.  Table 4 summarizes these values.

   The join procedure involves a special exchange where the end-device
   asserts the AppEUI and DevEUI (integrity protected with the long-term
   AppKey, but not encrypted) in a Join-request uplink message.  This is
   then routed to the network server which interacts with an entity that
   knows that AppKey to verify the Join-request.  All going well, a
   Join-accept downlink message is returned from the network server to

   the end-device that specifies the 24-bit NetID, 32-bit DevAddr and
   channel information and from which the AppSKey and NwkSKey can be
   derived based on knowledge of the AppKey.  This provides the end-
   device with all the values listed in Table 3.

   All payloads are encrypted and have data integrity.  MAC commands,
   when sent as a payload (port zero), are therefore protected.  MAC
   commands piggy-backed as frame options ("FOpts") are however sent in
   clear.  Any MAC commands sent as frame options and not only as
   payload, are visible to a passive attacker but are not malleable for
   an active attacker due to the use of the Message Integrity Check
   (MIC) described below.

   For LoRaWAN version 1.0.x, the NWkSkey session key is used to provide
   data integrity between the end-device and the network server.  The
   AppSKey is used to provide data confidentiality between the end-
   device and network server, or to the application "behind" the network
   server, depending on the implementation of the network.

   All MAC layer messages have an outer 32-bit MIC calculated using AES-
   CMAC calculated over the ciphertext payload and other headers and
   using the NwkSkey.  Payloads are encrypted using AES-128, with a
   counter-mode derived from IEEE 802.15.4 using the AppSKey.  Gateways
   are not expected to be provided with the AppSKey or NwkSKey, all of
   the infrastructure-side cryptography happens in (or "behind") the
   network server.  When session keys are derived from the AppKey as a
   result of the join procedure the Join-accept message payload is
   specially handled.

   The long-term AppKey is directly used to protect the Join-accept
   message content, but the function used is not an AES-encrypt
   operation, but rather an AES-decrypt operation.  The justification is
   that this means that the end-device only needs to implement the AES-
   encrypt operation.  (The counter mode variant used for payload
   decryption means the end-device doesn't need an AES-decrypt
   primitive.)

   The Join-accept plaintext is always less than 16 bytes long, so
   electronic code book (ECB) mode is used for protecting Join-accept
   messages.  The Join-accept contains an AppNonce (a 24 bit value) that
   is recovered on the end-device along with the other Join-accept
   content (e.g.  DevAddr) using the AES-encrypt operation.  Once the
   Join-accept payload is available to the end-device the session keys
   are derived from the AppKey, AppNonce and other values, again using
   an ECB mode AES-encrypt operation, with the plaintext input being a
   maximum of 16 octets.

2.2.  Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)

2.2.1.  Provenance and Documents

   Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is developed and standardized
   by 3GPP.  The standardization of NB-IoT was finalized with 3GPP
   Release 13 in June 2016, and further enhancements for NB-IoT are
   specified in 3GPP Release 14 in 2017, for example in the form of
   multicast support.  Further features and improvements will be
   developed in the following releases, but NB-IoT has been ready to be
   deployed since 2016, and is rather simple to deploy especially in the
   existing LTE networks with a software upgrade in the operator's base
   stations.  For more information of what has been specified for NB-
   IoT, 3GPP specification 36.300 [TGPP36300] provides an overview and
   overall description of the E-UTRAN radio interface protocol
   architecture, while specifications 36.321 [TGPP36321], 36.322
   [TGPP36322], 36.323 [TGPP36323] and 36.331 [TGPP36331] give more
   detailed description of MAC, Radio Link Control (RLC), Packet Data
   Convergence Protocol (PDCP) and Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol
   layers, respectively.  Note that the description below assumes
   familiarity with numerous 3GPP terms.

   For a general overview of NB-IoT, see [nbiot-ov].

2.2.2.  Characteristics

   Specific targets for NB-IoT include: Less than US$5 module cost,
   extended coverage of 164 dB maximum coupling loss, battery life of
   over 10 years, ~55000 devices per cell and uplink reporting latency
   of less than 10 seconds.

   NB-IoT supports Half Duplex FDD operation mode with 60 kbps peak rate
   in uplink and 30 kbps peak rate in downlink, and a maximum
   transmission unit (MTU) size of 1600 bytes limited by PDCP layer (see
   Figure 4 for the protocol structure), which is the highest layer in
   the user plane, as explained later.  Any packet size up to the said
   MTU size can be passed to the NB-IoT stack from higher layers,
   segmentation of the packet is performed in the RLC layer, which can
   segment the data to transmission blocks with size as small as 16
   bits.  As the name suggests, NB-IoT uses narrowbands with bandwidth
   of 180 kHz in both downlink and uplink.  The multiple access scheme
   used in the downlink is OFDMA with 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing.  In
   uplink, SC-FDMA single tone with either 15kHz or 3.75 kHz tone
   spacing is used, or optionally multi-tone SC- FDMA can be used with
   15 kHz tone spacing.

   NB-IoT can be deployed in three ways.  In-band deployment means that
   the narrowband is deployed inside the LTE band and radio resources



Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


   are flexibly shared between NB-IoT and normal LTE carrier.  In Guard-
   band deployment the narrowband uses the unused resource blocks
   between two adjacent LTE carriers.  Standalone deployment is also
   supported, where the narrowband can be located alone in dedicated
   spectrum, which makes it possible for example to reframe a GSM
   carrier at 850/900 MHz for NB-IoT.  All three deployment modes are
   used in licensed frequency bands.  The maximum transmission power is
   either 20 or 23 dBm for uplink transmissions, while for downlink
   transmission the eNodeB may use higher transmission power, up to 46
   dBm depending on the deployment.

   A maximum coupling loss (MCL) target for NB-IoT coverage enhancements
   defined by 3GPP is 164 dB.  With this MCL, the performance of NB-IoT
   in downlink varies between 200 bps and 2-3 kbps, depending on the
   deployment mode.  Stand-alone operation may achieve the highest data
   rates, up to few kbps, while in-band and guard-band operations may
   reach several hundreds of bps.  NB-IoT may even operate with MCL
   higher than 170 dB with very low bit rates.

   For signaling optimization, two options are introduced in addition to
   legacy LTE RRC connection setup; mandatory Data-over-NAS (Control
   Plane optimization, solution 2 in [TGPP23720]) and optional RRC
   Suspend/Resume (User Plane optimization, solution 18 in [TGPP23720]).
   In the control plane optimization the data is sent over Non-Access
   Stratum, directly to/from Mobility Management Entity (MME) (see
   Figure 3 for the network architecture) in the core network to the
   User Equipment (UE) without interaction from the base station.  This
   means there are no Access Stratum security or header compression
   provided by the PDCP layer in the eNodeB, as the Access Stratum is
   bypassed, and only limited RRC procedures.  RoHC based header
   compression may still optionally be provided and terminated in MME.

   The RRC Suspend/Resume procedures reduce the signaling overhead
   required for UE state transition from RRC Idle to RRC Connected mode
   compared to legacy LTE operation in order to have quicker user plane
   transaction with the network and return to RRC Idle mode faster.

   In order to prolong device battery life, both power-saving mode (PSM)
   and extended DRX (eDRX) are available to NB-IoT.  With eDRX the RRC
   Connected mode DRX cycle is up to 10.24 seconds and in RRC Idle the
   eDRX cycle can be up to 3 hours.  In PSM the device is in a deep
   sleep state and only wakes up for uplink reporting, after which there
   is a window, configured by the network, during which the device
   receiver is open for downlink connectivity, of for periodical "keep-
   alive" signaling (PSM uses periodic TAU signaling with additional
   reception window for downlink reachability).

   Since NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum, it has no channel access
   restrictions allowing up to a 100% duty-cycle.

   3GPP access security is specified in [TGPP33203].

                    Figure 3: 3GPP network architecture

   Figure 3 shows the 3GPP network architecture, which applies to NB-
   IoT.  Mobility Management Entity (MME) is responsible for handling
   the mobility of the UE.  MME tasks include tracking and paging UEs,
   session management, choosing the Serving gateway for the UE during
   initial attachment and authenticating the user.  At MME, the Non-
   Access Stratum (NAS) signaling from the UE is terminated.

   Serving Gateway (S-GW) routes and forwards the user data packets
   through the access network and acts as a mobility anchor for UEs
   during handover between base stations known as eNodeBs and also
   during handovers between NB-IoT and other 3GPP technologies.

   Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) works as an interface between 3GPP
   network and external networks.

   The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) contains user-related and
   subscription- related information.  It is a database, which performs
   mobility management, session establishment support, user
   authentication and access authorization.

   E-UTRAN consists of components of a single type, eNodeB. eNodeB is a
   base station, which controls the UEs in one or several cells.

   The 3GPP radio protocol architecture is illustrated in Figure 4.

       Figure 4: 3GPP radio protocol architecture for control plane

   Control plane protocol stack

   The radio protocol architecture of NB-IoT (and LTE) is separated into
   control plane and user plane.  The control plane consists of
   protocols which control the radio access bearers and the connection
   between the UE and the network.  The highest layer of control plane
   is called Non-Access Stratum (NAS), which conveys the radio signaling
   between the UE and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), passing
   transparently through the radio network.  NAS responsible for
   authentication, security control, mobility management and bearer
   management.

   Access Stratum (AS) is the functional layer below NAS, and in the
   control plane it consists of Radio Resource Control protocol (RRC)
   [TGPP36331], which handles connection establishment and release
   functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer
   establishment, reconfiguration and release.  RRC configures the user
   and control planes according to the network status.  There exists two
   RRC states, RRC_Idle or RRC_Connected, and RRC entity controls the
   switching between these states.  In RRC_Idle, the network knows that
   the UE is present in the network and the UE can be reached in case of
   incoming call/downlink data.  In this state, the UE monitors paging,
   performs cell measurements and cell selection and acquires system
   information.  Also the UE can receive broadcast and multicast data,
   but it is not expected to transmit or receive unicast data.  In
   RRC_Connected the UE has a connection to the eNodeB, the network
   knows the UE location on the cell level and the UE may receive and
   transmit unicast data.  An RRC connection is established when the UE
   is expected to be active in the network, to transmit or receive data.
   The RRC connection is released, switching back to RRC_Idle, when

   there is no more traffic in order to preserve UE battery life and
   radio resources.  However, a new feature was introduced for NB-IoT,
   as mentioned earlier, which allows data to be transmitted from the
   MME directly to the UE transparently to the eNodeB, thus bypassing AS
   functions.

   Packet Data Convergence Protocol's (PDCP) [TGPP36323] main services
   in control plane are transfer of control plane data, ciphering and
   integrity protection.

   Radio Link Control protocol (RLC) [TGPP36322] performs transfer of
   upper layer PDUs and optionally error correction with Automatic
   Repeat reQuest (ARQ), concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of
   RLC SDUs, in-sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs, duplicate
   detection, RLC SDU discard, RLC-re-establishment and protocol error
   detection and recovery.

   Medium Access Control protocol (MAC) [TGPP36321] provides mapping
   between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing of MAC
   SDUs, scheduling information reporting, error correction with HARQ,
   priority handling and transport format selection.

   Physical layer [TGPP36201] provides data transport services to higher
   layers.  These include error detection and indication to higher
   layers, FEC encoding, HARQ soft-combining, rate matching and mapping
   of the transport channels onto physical channels, power weighting and
   modulation of physical channels, frequency and time synchronization
   and radio characteristics measurements.

   User plane is responsible for transferring the user data through the
   Access Stratum.  It interfaces with IP and the highest layer of user
   plane is PDCP, which in user plane performs header compression using
   Robust Header Compression (RoHC), transfer of user plane data between
   eNodeB and UE, ciphering and integrity protection.  Similar to
   control plane, lower layers in user plane include RLC, MAC and
   physical layer performing the same tasks as in control plane.

2.3.  SIGFOX

2.3.1.  Provenance and Documents

   The SIGFOX LPWAN is in line with the terminology and specifications
   being defined by ETSI [etsi_unb].  As of today, SIGFOX's network has
   been fully deployed in 12 countries, with ongoing deployments on 26
   other countries, giving in total a geography of 2 million square
   kilometers, containing 512 million people.

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


2.3.2.  Characteristics

   SIGFOX LPWAN autonomous battery-operated devices send only a few
   bytes per day, week or month, in principle allowing them to remain on
   a single battery for up to 10-15 years.  Hence, the system is
   designed as to allow devices to last several years, sometimes even
   buried underground.

   Since the radio protocol is connection-less and optimized for uplink
   communications, the capacity of a SIGFOX base station depends on the
   number of messages generated by devices, and not on the actual number
   of devices.  Likewise, the battery life of devices depends on the
   number of messages generated by the device.  Depending on the use
   case, devices can vary from sending less than one message per device
   per day, to dozens of messages per device per day.

   The coverage of the cell depends on the link budget and on the type
   of deployment (urban, rural, etc.).  The radio interface is compliant
   with the following regulations:

      Spectrum allocation in the USA [fcc_ref]

      Spectrum allocation in Europe [etsi_ref]

      Spectrum allocation in Japan [arib_ref]

   The SIGFOX radio interface is also compliant with the local
   regulations of the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada,
   Kenya, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Peru,
   Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Thailand.

   The radio interface is based on Ultra Narrow Band (UNB)
   communications, which allow an increased transmission range by
   spending a limited amount of energy at the device.  Moreover, UNB
   allows a large number of devices to coexist in a given cell without
   significantly increasing the spectrum interference.

   Both uplink and downlink are supported, although the system is
   optimized for uplink communications.  Due to spectrum optimizations,
   different uplink and downlink frames and time synchronization methods
   are needed.

   The main radio characteristics of the UNB uplink transmission are:

   o  Channelization mask: 100 Hz / 600 Hz (depending on the region)

   o  Uplink baud rate: 100 baud / 600 baud (depending on the region)

   o  Modulation scheme: DBPSK

   o  Uplink transmission power: compliant with local regulation

   o  Link budget: 155 dB (or better)

   o  Central frequency accuracy: not relevant, provided there is no
      significant frequency drift within an uplink packet transmission

   For example, in Europe the UNB uplink frequency band is limited to
   868.00 to 868.60 MHz, with a maximum output power of 25 mW and a duty
   cycle of 1%.

   The format of the uplink frame is the following:

   +--------+--------+--------+------------------+-------------+-----+
   |Preamble|  Frame | Dev ID |     Payload      |Msg Auth Code| FCS |
   |        |  Sync  |        |                  |             |     |
   +--------+--------+--------+------------------+-------------+-----+


                       Figure 5: Uplink Frame Format

   The uplink frame is composed of the following fields:

   o  Preamble: 19 bits

   o  Frame sync and header: 29 bits

   o  Device ID: 32 bits

   o  Payload: 0-96 bits

   o  Authentication: 16-40 bits

   o  Frame check sequence: 16 bits (CRC)

   The main radio characteristics of the UNB downlink transmission are:

   o  Channelization mask: 1.5 kHz

   o  Downlink baud rate: 600 baud

   o  Modulation scheme: GFSK

   o  Downlink transmission power: 500 mW / 4W (depending on the region)

   o  Link budget: 153 dB (or better)

   o  Central frequency accuracy: the center frequency of downlink
      transmission is set by the network according to the corresponding
      uplink transmission

   For example, in Europe the UNB downlink frequency band is limited to
   869.40 to 869.65 MHz, with a maximum output power of 500 mW with 10%
   duty cycle.

   The format of the downlink frame is the following:

   +------------+-----+---------+------------------+-------------+-----+
   |  Preamble  |Frame|   ECC   |     Payload      |Msg Auth Code| FCS |
   |            |Sync |         |                  |             |     |
   +------------+-----+---------+------------------+-------------+-----+


                      Figure 6: Downlink Frame Format

   The downlink frame is composed of the following fields:

   o  Preamble: 91 bits

   o  Frame sync and header: 13 bits

   o  Error Correcting Code (ECC): 32 bits

   o  Payload: 0-64 bits

   o  Authentication: 16 bits

   o  Frame check sequence: 8 bits (CRC)

   The radio interface is optimized for uplink transmissions, which are
   asynchronous.  Downlink communications are achieved by devices
   querying the network for available data.

   A device willing to receive downlink messages opens a fixed window
   for reception after sending an uplink transmission.  The delay and
   duration of this window have fixed values.  The network transmits the
   downlink message for a given device during the reception window, and
   the network also selects the base station (BS) for transmitting the
   corresponding downlink message.

   Uplink and downlink transmissions are unbalanced due to the
   regulatory constraints on ISM bands.  Under the strictest
   regulations, the system can allow a maximum of 140 uplink messages
   and 4 downlink messages per device per day.  These restrictions can

   be slightly relaxed depending on system conditions and the specific
   regulatory domain of operation.

                   Figure 7: SIGFOX network architecture

   Figure 7 depicts the different elements of the SIGFOX network
   architecture.

   SIGFOX has a "one-contract one-network" model allowing devices to
   connect in any country, without any need or notion of either roaming
   or handover.

   The architecture consists of a single cloud-based core network, which
   allows global connectivity with minimal impact on the end device and
   radio access network.  The core network elements are the Service
   Center (SC) and the Registration Authority (RA).  The SC is in charge
   of the data connectivity between the Base Station (BS) and the
   Internet, as well as the control and management of the BSs and End
   Points.  The RA is in charge of the End Point network access
   authorization.

   The radio access network is comprised of several BSs connected
   directly to the SC.  Each BS performs complex L1/L2 functions,
   leaving some L2 and L3 functionalities to the SC.

   The Devices (DEVs) or End Points (EPs) are the objects that
   communicate application data between local device applications (DAs)
   and network applications (NAs).

   Devices (or EPs) can be static or nomadic, as they associate with the
   SC and they do not attach to any specific BS.  Hence, they can
   communicate with the SC through one or multiple BSs.

   Due to constraints in the complexity of the Device, it is assumed
   that Devices host only one or very few device applications, which
   most of the time communicate each to a single network application at
   a time.

   The radio protocol authenticates and ensures the integrity of each
   message.  This is achieved by using a unique device ID and an AES-128
   based message authentication code, ensuring that the message has been
   generated and sent by the device with the ID claimed in the message.
   Application data can be encrypted at the application level or not,
   depending on the criticality of the use case, to provide a balance
   between cost and effort vs. risk.  AES-128 in counter mode is used
   for encryption.  Cryptographic keys are independent for each device.
   These keys are associated with the device ID and separate integrity
   and confidentiality keys are pre-provisioned.  A confidentiality key
   is only provisioned if confidentiality is to be used.  At the time of
   writing the algorithms and keying details for this are not published.

2.4.  Wi-SUN Alliance Field Area Network (FAN)

   Text here is via personal communication from Bob Heile
   (bheile@ieee.org) and was authored by Bob and Sum Chin Sean.  Duffy
   (paduffy@cisco.com) also provided additional comments/input on this
   section.

2.4.1.  Provenance and Documents

   The Wi-SUN Alliance <https://www.wi-sun.org/> is an industry alliance
   for smart city, smart grid, smart utility, and a broad set of general
   IoT applications.  The Wi-SUN Alliance Field Area Network (FAN)
   profile is open standards based (primarily on IETF and IEEE802
   standards) and was developed to address applications like smart
   municipality/city infrastructure monitoring and management, electric
   vehicle (EV) infrastructure, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI),
   distribution automation (DA), supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) protection/management, distributed generation
   monitoring and management, and many more IoT applications.
   Additionally, the Alliance has created a certification program to
   promote global multi-vendor interoperability.

   The FAN profile is specified within ANSI/TIA as an extension of work
   previously done on Smart Utility Networks.  [ANSI-4957-000].  Updates
   to those specifications intended to be published in 2017 will contain
   details of the FAN profile.  A current snapshot of the work to

   produce that profile is presented in [wisun-pressie1]
   [wisun-pressie2] .

2.4.2.  Characteristics

   The FAN profile is an IPv6 wireless mesh network with support for
   enterprise level security.  The frequency hopping wireless mesh
   topology aims to offer superior network robustness, reliability due
   to high redundancy, good scalability due to the flexible mesh
   configuration and good resilience to interference.  Very low power
   modes are in development permitting long term battery operation of
   network nodes.

   The following list contains some overall characteristics of Wi-SUN
   that are relevant to LPWAN applications.

   o  Coverage: The range of Wi-SUN FAN is typically 2 -- 3 km in line
      of sight, matching the needs of neighborhood area networks, campus
      area networks, or corporate area networks.  The range can also be
      extended via multi-hop networking.

   o  High bandwidth, low link latency: Wi-SUN supports relatively high
      bandwidth, i.e. up to 300 kbps [FANTPS], enables remote update and
      upgrade of devices so that they can handle new applications,
      extending their working life.  Wi-SUN supports LPWAN IoT
      applications that require on-demand control by providing low link
      latency (0.02s) and bi-directional communication.

   o  Low power consumption: FAN devices draw less than 2 uA when
      resting and only 8 mA when listening.  Such devices can maintain a
      long lifetime even if they are frequently listening.  For
      instance, suppose the device transmits data for 10 ms once every
      10 s; theoretically, a battery of 1000 mAh can last more than 10
      years.

   o  Scalability: Tens of millions Wi-SUN FAN devices have been
      deployed in urban, suburban and rural environments, including
      deployments with more than 1 million devices.

   A FAN contains one or more networks.  Within a network, nodes assume
   one of three operational roles.  First, each network contains a
   Border Router providing Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity to the
   network.  The Border Router maintains source routing tables for all
   nodes within its network, provides node authentication and key
   management services, and disseminates network-wide information such
   as broadcast schedules.  Secondly, Router nodes, which provide upward
   and downward packet forwarding (within a network).  A Router also
   provides services for relaying security and address management



Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018               [Page 21]

   protocols.  Lastly, Leaf nodes provide minimum capabilities:
   discovering and joining a network, send/receive IPv6 packets, etc.  A
   low power network may contain a mesh topology with Routers at the
   edges that construct a star topology with Leaf nodes.

   The FAN profile is based on various open standards developed by the
   IETF (including [RFC0768], [RFC2460], [RFC4443] and [RFC6282]),
   IEEE802 (including [IEEE-802-15-4] and [IEEE-802-15-9]) and ANSI/TIA
   [ANSI-4957-210] for low power and lossy networks.

   The FAN profile specification provides an application-independent
   IPv6-based transport service.  There are two possible methods for
   establishing the IPv6 packet routing: Routing Protocol for Low-Power
   and Lossy Networks (RPL) at the Network layer is mandatory, and
   Multi-Hop Delivery Service (MHDS) is optional at the Data Link layer.
   Table 5 provides an overview of the FAN network stack.

   The Transport service is based on User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
   defined in RFC768 or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) defined in
   RFC793.

   The Network service is provided by IPv6 as defined in RFC2460 with
   6LoWPAN adaptation as defined in RFC4944 and RFC6282.  ICMPv6, as
   defined in RFC4443, is used for the control plane during information
   exchange.

   The Data Link service provides both control/management of the
   Physical layer and data transfer/management services to the Network
   layer.  These services are divided into Media Access Control (MAC)
   and Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layers.  The LLC sub-layer
   provides a protocol dispatch service which supports 6LoWPAN and an
   optional MAC sub-layer mesh service.  The MAC sub-layer is
   constructed using data structures defined in IEEE802.15.4-2015.
   Multiple modes of frequency hopping are defined.  The entire MAC
   payload is encapsulated in an IEEE802.15.9 Information Element to
   enable LLC protocol dispatch between upper layer 6LoWPAN processing,
   MAC sublayer mesh processing, etc.  These areas will be expanded once
   IEEE802.15.12 is completed.

   The PHY service is derived from a sub-set of the SUN FSK
   specification in IEEE802.15.4-2015.  The 2-FSK modulation schemes,
   with channel spacing range from 200 to 600 kHz, are defined to
   provide data rates from 50 to 300 kbps, with Forward Error Coding
   (FEC) as an optional feature.  Towards enabling ultra-low-power
   applications, the PHY layer design is also extendable to low energy
   and critical infrastructure monitoring networks.

   between a FAN node and its Border Router, which is implemented with
   an adaptation of IEEE802.1X and EAP-TLS as described in [RFC5216]
   using secure device identity as described in IEEE802.1AR.
   Certificate formats are based upon [RFC5280].  A secure group link
   between a Border Router and a set of FAN nodes is established using
   an adaptation of the IEEE802.11 Four-Way Handshake.  A set of 4 group
   keys are maintained within the network, one of which is the current
   transmit key.  Secure node to node links are supported between one-
   hop FAN neighbors using an adaptation of ETSI-TS-102-887-2.  FAN
   nodes implement Frame Security as specified in IEEE802.15.4-2015.

3.  Generic Terminology

   LPWAN technologies, such as those discussed above, have similar
   architectures but different terminology.  We can identify different
   types of entities in a typical LPWAN network:

   o  End-Devices are the devices or the "things" (e.g. sensors,
      actuators, etc.); they are named differently in each technology
      (End Device, User Equipment or End Point).  There can be a high
      density of end devices per radio gateway.

   o  The Radio Gateway, which is the end point of the constrained link.
      It is known as: Gateway, Evolved Node B or Base station.

   o  The Network Gateway or Router is the interconnection node between
      the Radio Gateway and the Internet.  It is known as: Network
      Server, Serving GW or Service Center.

   o  LPWAN-AAA Server, which controls the user authentication, the
      applications.  It is known as: Join-Server, Home Subscriber Server
      or Registration Authority.  (We use the term LPWAN-AAA server
      because we're not assuming that this entity speaks RADIUS or
      Diameter as many/most AAA servers do, but equally we don't want to
      rule that out, as the functionality will be similar.

   o  At last we have the Application Server, known also as Packet Data
      Node Gateway or Network Application.

   In addition to the names of entities, LPWANs are also subject to
   possibly regional frequency band regulations.  Those may include
   restrictions on the duty-cycle, for example requiring that hosts only
   transmit for a certain percentage of each hour.

4.  Gap Analysis

   This section considers some of the gaps between current LPWAN
   technologies and the goals of the LPWAN working group.  Many of the
   generic considerations described in [RFC7452] will also apply in
   LPWANs, as end-devices can also be considered as a subclass of (so-



Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


   called) "smart objects."  In addition, LPWAN device implementers will
   also need to consider the issues relating to firmware updates
   described in [RFC8240].

4.1.  Naive application of IPv6

   IPv6 [RFC8200] has been designed to allocate addresses to all the
   nodes connected to the Internet.  Nevertheless, the header overhead
   of at least 40 bytes introduced by the protocol is incompatible with
   LPWAN constraints.  If IPv6 with no further optimization were used,
   several LPWAN frames could be needed just to carry the IP header.
   Another problem arises from IPv6 MTU requirements, which require the
   layer below to support at least 1280 byte packets [RFC2460].

   IPv6 has a configuration protocol - neighbor discovery protocol,
   (NDP) [RFC4861]).  For a node to learn network parameters NDP
   generates regular traffic with a relatively large message size that
   does not fit LPWAN constraints.

   In some LPWAN technologies, layer two multicast is not supported.  In
   that case, if the network topology is a star, the solution and
   considerations of section 3.2.5 of [RFC7668] may be applied.

   Other key protocols such as DHCPv6 [RFC3315], IPsec [RFC4301] and TLS
   [RFC5246] have similarly problematic properties in this context.
   Each of those require relatively frequent round-trips between the
   host and some other host on the network.  In the case of
   cryptographic protocols such as IPsec and TLS, in addition to the
   round-trips required for secure session establishment, cryptographic
   operations can require padding and addition of authenticators that
   are problematic when considering LPWAN lower layers.  Note that mains
   powered Wi-SUN mesh router nodes will typically be more resource
   capable than the other LPWAN techs discussed.  This can enable use of
   more "chatty" protocols for some aspects of Wi-SUN.

4.2.  6LoWPAN

   Several technologies that exhibit significant constraints in various
   dimensions have exploited the 6LoWPAN suite of specifications
   [RFC4944], [RFC6282], [RFC6775] to support IPv6
   [I-D.hong-6lo-use-cases].  However, the constraints of LPWANs, often
   more extreme than those typical of technologies that have (re)used
   6LoWPAN, constitute a challenge for the 6LoWPAN suite in order to
   enable IPv6 over LPWAN.  LPWANs are characterized by device
   constraints (in terms of processing capacity, memory, and energy
   availability), and specially, link constraints, such as:

   o  tiny layer two payload size (from ~10 to ~100 bytes),



Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


   o  very low bit rate (from ~10 bit/s to ~100 kbit/s), and

   o  in some specific technologies, further message rate constraints
      (e.g.  between ~0.1 message/minute and ~1 message/minute) due to
      regional regulations that limit the duty cycle.

4.2.1.  Header Compression

   6LoWPAN header compression reduces IPv6 (and UDP) header overhead by
   eliding header fields when they can be derived from the link layer,
   and by assuming that some of the header fields will frequently carry
   expected values. 6LoWPAN provides both stateless and stateful header
   compression.  In the latter, all nodes of a 6LoWPAN are assumed to
   share compression context.  In the best case, the IPv6 header for
   link-local communication can be reduced to only 2 bytes.  For global
   communication, the IPv6 header may be compressed down to 3 bytes in
   the most extreme case.  However, in more practical situations, the
   smallest IPv6 header size may be 11 bytes (one address prefix
   compressed) or 19 bytes (both source and destination prefixes
   compressed).  These headers are large considering the link layer
   payload size of LPWAN technologies, and in some cases are even bigger
   than the LPWAN PDUs. 6LoWPAN has been initially designed for IEEE
   802.15.4 networks with a frame size up to 127 bytes and a throughput
   of up to 250 kb/s, which may or may not be duty-cycled.

4.2.2.  Address Autoconfiguration

   Traditionally, Interface Identifiers (IIDs) have been derived from
   link layer identifiers [RFC4944] . This allows optimizations such as
   header compression.  Nevertheless, recent guidance has given advice
   on the fact that, due to privacy concerns, 6LoWPAN devices should not
   be configured to embed their link layer addresses in the IID by
   default.  [RFC8065] provides guidance on better methods for
   generating IIDs.

4.2.3.  Fragmentation

   As stated above, IPv6 requires the layer below to support an MTU of
   1280 bytes [RFC2460].  Therefore, given the low maximum payload size
   of LPWAN technologies, fragmentation is needed.

   If a layer of an LPWAN technology supports fragmentation, proper
   analysis has to be carried out to decide whether the fragmentation
   functionality provided by the lower layer or fragmentation at the
   adaptation layer should be used.  Otherwise, fragmentation
   functionality shall be used at the adaptation layer.





Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


   6LoWPAN defined a fragmentation mechanism and a fragmentation header
   to support the transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   networks [RFC4944].  While the 6LoWPAN fragmentation header is
   appropriate for IEEE 802.15.4-2003 (which has a frame payload size of
   81-102 bytes), it is not suitable for several LPWAN technologies,
   many of which have a maximum payload size that is one order of
   magnitude below that of IEEE 802.15.4-2003.  The overhead of the
   6LoWPAN fragmentation header is high, considering the reduced payload
   size of LPWAN technologies and the limited energy availability of the
   devices using such technologies.  Furthermore, its datagram offset
   field is expressed in increments of eight octets.  In some LPWAN
   technologies, the 6LoWPAN fragmentation header plus eight octets from
   the original datagram exceeds the available space in the layer two
   payload.  In addition, the MTU in the LPWAN networks could be
   variable which implies a variable fragmentation solution.

4.2.4.  Neighbor Discovery

   6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery [RFC6775] defined optimizations to IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861], in order to adapt functionality of the
   latter for networks of devices using IEEE 802.15.4 or similar
   technologies.  The optimizations comprise host-initiated interactions
   to allow for sleeping hosts, replacement of multicast-based address
   resolution for hosts by an address registration mechanism, multihop
   extensions for prefix distribution and duplicate address detection
   (note that these are not needed in a star topology network), and
   support for 6LoWPAN header compression.

   6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery may be used in not so severely constrained
   LPWAN networks.  The relative overhead incurred will depend on the
   LPWAN technology used (and on its configuration, if appropriate).  In
   certain LPWAN setups (with a maximum payload size above ~60 bytes,
   and duty-cycle-free or equivalent operation), an RS/RA/NS/NA exchange
   may be completed in a few seconds, without incurring packet
   fragmentation.

   In other LPWANs (with a maximum payload size of ~10 bytes, and a
   message rate of ~0.1 message/minute), the same exchange may take
   hours or even days, leading to severe fragmentation and consuming a
   significant amount of the available network resources.  6LoWPAN
   Neighbor Discovery behavior may be tuned through the use of
   appropriate values for the default Router Lifetime, the Valid
   Lifetime in the PIOs, and the Valid Lifetime in the 6LoWPAN Context
   Option (6CO), as well as the address Registration Lifetime.  However,
   for the latter LPWANs mentioned above, 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery is
   not suitable.

4.3.  6lo

   The 6lo WG has been reusing and adapting 6LoWPAN to enable IPv6
   support over link layer technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy
   (BTLE), ITU-T G.9959, DECT-ULE, MS/TP-RS485, NFC IEEE 802.11ah.  (See
   <https://tools.ietf.org/wg/6lo> for details.)  These technologies are
   similar in several aspects to IEEE 802.15.4, which was the original
   6LoWPAN target technology.

   6lo has mostly used the subset of 6LoWPAN techniques best suited for
   each lower layer technology, and has provided additional
   optimizations for technologies where the star topology is used, such
   as BTLE or DECT-ULE.

   The main constraint in these networks comes from the nature of the
   devices (constrained devices), whereas in LPWANs it is the network
   itself that imposes the most stringent constraints.

4.4.  6tisch

   The 6tisch solution is dedicated to mesh networks that operate using
   802.15.4e MAC with a deterministic slotted channel.  The time slot
   channel (TSCH) can help to reduce collisions and to enable a better
   balance over the channels.  It improves the battery life by avoiding
   the idle listening time for the return channel.

   A key element of 6tisch is the use of synchronization to enable
   determinism.  TSCH and 6TiSCH may provide a standard scheduling
   function.  The LPWAN networks probably will not support
   synchronization like the one used in 6tisch.

4.5.  RoHC

   Robust header compression (RoHC) is a header compression mechanism
   [RFC3095] developed for multimedia flows in a point to point channel.
   RoHC uses 3 levels of compression, each level having its own header
   format.  In the first level, RoHC sends 52 bytes of header, in the
   second level the header could be from 34 to 15 bytes and in the third
   level header size could be from 7 to 2 bytes.  The level of
   compression is managed by a sequence number, which varies in size
   from 2 bytes to 4 bits in the minimal compression.  SN compression is
   done with an algorithm called W-LSB (Window- Least Significant Bits).
   This window has a 4-bit size representing 15 packets, so every 15
   packets RoHC needs to slide the window in order to receive the
   correct sequence number, and sliding the window implies a reduction
   of the level of compression.  When packets are lost or errored, the
   decompressor loses context and drops packets until a bigger header is
   sent with more complete information.  To estimate the performance of



Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


   RoHC, an average header size is used.  This average depends on the
   transmission conditions, but most of the time is between 3 and 4
   bytes.

   RoHC has not been adapted specifically to the constrained hosts and
   networks of LPWANs: it does not take into account energy limitations
   nor the transmission rate, and RoHC context is synchronised during
   transmission, which does not allow better compression.

4.6.  ROLL

   Most technologies considered by the lpwan WG are based on a star
   topology, which eliminates the need for routing at that layer.
   Future work may address additional use-cases that may require
   adaptation of existing routing protocols or the definition of new
   ones.  As of the time of writing, work similar to that done in the
   ROLL WG and other routing protocols are out of scope of the LPWAN WG.

4.7.  CoAP

   CoAP [RFC7252] provides a RESTful framework for applications intended
   to run on constrained IP networks.  It may be necessary to adapt CoAP
   or related protocols to take into account for the extreme duty cycles
   and the potentially extremely limited throughput of LPWANs.

   For example, some of the timers in CoAP may need to be redefined.
   Taking into account CoAP acknowledgments may allow the reduction of
   L2 acknowledgments.  On the other hand, the current work in progress
   in the CoRE WG where the COMI/CoOL network management interface
   which, uses Structured Identifiers (SID) to reduce payload size over
   CoAP may prove to be a good solution for the LPWAN technologies.  The
   overhead is reduced by adding a dictionary which matches a URI to a
   small identifier and a compact mapping of the YANG model into the
   CBOR binary representation.

4.8.  Mobility

   LPWAN nodes can be mobile.  However, LPWAN mobility is different from
   the one specified for Mobile IP.  LPWAN implies sporadic traffic and
   will rarely be used for high-frequency, real-time communications.
   The applications do not generate a flow, they need to save energy and
   most of the time the node will be down.

   In addition, LPWAN mobility may mostly apply to groups of devices,
   that represent a network in which case mobility is more a concern for
   the gateway than the devices.  NEMO [RFC3963] Mobility or other
   mobile gateway solutions (such as a gateway with an LTE uplink) may
   be used in the case where some end-devices belonging to the same



Farrell                  Expires August 11, 2018               [Page 30]

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


   network gateway move from one point to another such that they are not
   aware of being mobile.

4.9.  DNS and LPWAN

   The Domain Name System (DNS) DNS [RFC1035], enables applications to
   name things with a globally resolvable name.  Many protocols use the
   DNS to identify hosts, for example applications using CoAP.

   The DNS query/answer protocol as a pre-cursor to other communication
   within the time-to-live (TTL) of a DNS answer is clearly problematic
   in an LPWAN, say where only one round-trip per hour can be used, and
   with a TTL that is less than 3600.  It is currently unclear whether
   and how DNS-like functionality might be provided in LPWANs.

5.  Security Considerations

   Most LPWAN technologies integrate some authentication or encryption
   mechanisms that were defined outside the IETF.  The working group may
   need to do work to integrate these mechanisms to unify management.  A
   standardized Authentication, Accounting, and Authorization (AAA)
   infrastructure [RFC2904] may offer a scalable solution for some of
   the security and management issues for LPWANs.  AAA offers
   centralized management that may be of use in LPWANs, for example
   [I-D.garcia-dime-diameter-lorawan] and
   [I-D.garcia-radext-radius-lorawan] suggest possible security
   processes for a LoRaWAN network.  Similar mechanisms may be useful to
   explore for other LPWAN technologies.

   Some applications using LPWANs may raise few or no privacy
   considerations.  For example, temperature sensors in a large office
   building may not raise privacy issues.  However, the same sensors, if
   deployed in a home environment and especially if triggered due to
   human presence, can raise significant privacy issues - if an end-
   device emits (an encrypted) packet every time someone enters a room
   in a home, then that traffic is privacy sensitive.  And the more that
   the existence of that traffic is visible to network entities, the
   more privacy sensitivities arise.  At this point, it is not clear
   whether there are workable mitigations for problems like this - in a
   more typical network, one would consider defining padding mechanisms
   and allowing for cover traffic.  In some LPWANs, those mechanisms may
   not be feasible.  Nonetheless, the privacy challenges do exist and
   can be real and so some solutions will be needed.  Note that many
   aspects of solutions in this space may not be visible in IETF
   specifications, but can be e.g. implementation or deployment
   specific.

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview   February 2018


   Another challenge for LPWANs will be how to handle key management and
   associated protocols.  In a more traditional network (e.g. the web),
   servers can "staple" Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
   responses in order to allow browsers to check revocation status for
   presented certificates.  [RFC6961] While the stapling approach is
   likely something that would help in an LPWAN, as it avoids an RTT,
   certificates and OCSP responses are bulky items and will prove
   challenging to handle in LPWANs with bounded bandwidth.
