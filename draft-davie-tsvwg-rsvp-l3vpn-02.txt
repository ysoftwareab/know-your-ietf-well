Abstract

   RFC 4364 and RFC 4659 define an approach to building provider-
   provisioned Layer 3 VPNs for IPv4 and IPv6.  It may be desirable to
   use RSVP to perform admission control on the links between CE and PE
   routers.  This document specifies procedures by which RSVP messages
   travelling from CE to CE across an L3VPN may be appropriately handled
   by PE routers so that admission control can be performed on PE-CE
   links.  Optionally, admission control across the provider's backbone

Change history

   [_Note to RFC Editor: This section to be removed before publication_]

   Changes in this version (draft-davie-tsvwg-rsvp-l3vpn-02) relative to
   the last (draft-davie-tsvwg-rsvp-l3vpn-01):

   o  The SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTER_SPEC objects have been
      modified to carry VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) addresses instead of IPv4
      (or IPv6) addresses within the MPLS VPN.

   o  The VRF_ID and VPN_LABEL objects have been removed.  The VPN-IPv4
      addresses in the objects listed in the previous bullet have
      replaced the VRF_ID and VPN_LABEL for the purposes of state
      disambiguation and message forwarding.

   o  The requirement for Option-B ASBRs to do CAC has been lifted.  A
      new VPN-IPv4 HOP object has been proposed to optionally provide
      RSVP signalling reachability across Option-B ASBRs.

   o  Mechanisms for supporting aggregate RSVP sessions across MPLS VPNs
      have been added.

   o  Explicit support for IPv6 VPNs has been added.

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4364] and [RFC4659] define a Layer 3 VPN service known as BGP/
   MPLS VPNs for IPv4 and for IPv6 respectively.  [RFC2205] defines the
   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) which may be used to perform
   admission control as part of the Integrated Services (int-serv)
   architecture [RFC1633][RFC2210].

   Customers of a layer 3 VPN service may run RSVP for the purposes of
   admission control in their own networks.  Since the links between
   Provider Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) routers in a layer 3 VPN
   may often be resource constrained, it may be desirable to be able to
   perform admission control over those links.  In order to perform
   admission control using RSVP in such an environment, it is necessary
   that RSVP control messages, such as Path messages and Resv messages,
   are appropriately handled by the PE routers.  This presents a number
   of challenges in the context of BGP/MPLS VPNs:

   o  RSVP Path message processing depends on routers recognizing the
      router alert option in the IP header.  However, packets traversing
      the backbone of a BGP/MPLS VPN are MPLS encapsulated and thus the
      router alert option is not normally visible to the egress PE.

   o  BGP/MPLS VPNs support non-unique addressing of customer networks.
      Thus a PE at the ingress or egress of the provider backbone may be
      called upon to process Path messages from different customer VPNs
      with non-unique destination addresses.

   o  A PE at the ingress of the provider's backbone may receive Resv
      messages corresponding to different customer VPNs from other PEs,
      and needs to be able to associate those Resv messages with the
      appropriate customer VPNs.

   This document describes a set of procedures to overcome these
   challenges and thus to enable admission control using RSVP over the
   PE-CE links.  We note that similar techniques may be applicable to
   other protocols used for admission control such as NSIS [RFC4080].

   Additionally, it may be desirable to perform admission control over
   the provider's backbone on behalf of one or more L3VPN customers.
   Core (P) routers in a BGP/MPLS VPN do not have forwarding entries for
   customer routes, and thus cannot natively process RSVP messages for
   customer flows.  Also the core is a shared resource that carries
   traffic for many customers, so issues of resource allocation among
   customers and trust (or lack thereof) must also be addressed.  This
   draft also specifies procedures for supporting such a scenario.

   This draft deals with establishing reservations for unicast flows

   only.  Because the support of multicast traffic in BGP/MPLS VPNs is
   still evolving, and raises additional challenges for admission
   control, we leave the support of multicast flows for further study at
   this point.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document draws freely on the terminology defined in [RFC2205]
   and [RFC4364].  For convenience, we provide a few brief definitions
   here:

   o  CE (Customer Edge) Router: Router at the edge of a customer site
      that attaches to the network of the VPN provider.

   o  PE (Provider Edge) Router: Router at the edge of the service
      provider's network that attaches to one or more customer sites.

   o  VPN Label: An MPLS label associated with a route to a customer
      prefix in a VPN (also called a VPN route label).

   o  VRF: VPN Routing and Forwarding Table.  A PE typically has
      multiple VRFs, enabling it to be connected to CEs that are in
      different VPNs.


2.  Problem Statement

   The problem space of this document is the support of admission
   control between customer sites when the customer subscribes to a BGP/
   MPLS VPN.  We subdivide the problem into (a) the problem of admission
   control on the PE-CE links (in both directions), and (b) the problem
   of admission control across the provider's backbone.

   For the PE-CE link subproblem, the most basic challenge is that RSVP
   control messages contain IP addresses that are drawn from the
   customer's address space, and PEs must be able to deal with traffic
   from many customers who may have non-unique (or overlapping) address
   spaces.  Thus, it is essential that a PE be able in all cases to
   identify the correct VPN context in which to process an RSVP control
   message.  Much of this draft deals with this issue.

   For the case of making reservations across the provider backbone, we
   observe that BGP/MPLS VPNs do not create any per-customer forwarding
   state in the P (provider core) routers.  Thus, in order to make
   reservations on behalf of customer-specified flows, it is clearly
   necessary to make some sort of aggregated reservation from PE-PE and
   then map individual, customer-specific reservations onto an aggregate
   reservation.  That is similar to the problem tackled in [RFC3175] and



Davie, et al.            Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


   [RFC4804], with the additional complications of handling customer-
   specific addressing associated with BGP/MPLS VPNs.

   Finally, we note that RSVP Path messages are normally addressed to
   the destination of a session, and contain the router alert IP option.
   Routers along the path to the destination that are configured to
   process RSVP messages must detect the presence of the router alert
   option to allow them to intercept Path messages.  However, the egress
   PEs of a network supporting BGP/MPLS VPNs receive packets destined
   for customer sites as MPLS-encapsulated packets, and may forward
   those based only on examination of the MPLS label.  Hence, a Path
   message would be forwarded without examination of the IP options and
   would therefore not receive appropriate processing at the PE.  This
   problem of recognizing and processing Path messages is also discussed
   below.

   Figure 1 illustrates the basic model of operation with which this
   document is concerned.

   Figure 1.  Model of Operation for RSVP-based admission control over
   MPLS/BGP VPN

   To establish a unidirectional reservation for a point-to-point flow
   from Sender to Receiver that takes account of resource availability
   on the CE-PE and PE-CE links only, the following steps must take
   place:

   1.   Sender sends a Path message to an IP address of the Receiver.





Davie, et al.            Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


   2.   Path message is processed by CE1 using normal RSVP procedures
        and forwarded towards the Receiver along the link CE1-PE1.

   3.   PE1 processes Path message and forwards towards the Receiver
        across the provider backbone.

   4.   PE2 processes Path message and forwards towards the Receiver
        along link PE2-CE2.

   5.   CE2 processes Path message using normal RSVP procedures and
        forwards towards Receiver.

   6.   Receiver sends Resv message to CE2.

   7.   CE2 sends Resv message to PE2.

   8.   PE2 processes Resv message (including performing admission
        control on link PE2-CE2) and sends Resv to PE1.

   9.   PE1 processes Resv message and sends Resv to CE1.

   10.  CE1 processes Resv using normal RSVP procedures, performs
        admission control on the link CE1-PE1 and sends Resv message to
        Sender if successful.

   In each of the steps involving Resv messages (6 through 10) the node
   sending the Resv uses the previously established Path state to
   determine the "RSVP Previous Hop (PHOP)" and sends a Resv message to
   that address.  We note that establishing that Path state correctly at
   PEs is one of the challenges posed by the BGP/MPLS environment.


3.  Admission Control on PE-CE Links

   In the following sections we trace through the steps outlined in
   Section 2.1 and expand on the details for those steps where standard
   RSVP procedures need to be extended or modified to support the BGP/
   MPLS VPN environment.  For all the remaining steps described in the
   preceding section, standard RSVP processing rules apply.

   All the procedures described below support both IPv4 and IPv6
   addressing.  In all cases where IPv4 is referenced, IPv6 can be
   substituted with identical procedures and results.  Object
   definitions for both IPv4 and IPv6 are provided in Section 8.

3.1.  Path Message Processing at Ingress PE

   When a Path message arrives at the ingress PE (step 3 of Section 2.1)
   the PE needs to establish suitable Path state and forward the Path
   message on to the egress PE.  In the following paragraphs we
   described the steps taken by the ingress PE.

   The Path message is addressed to the eventual destination (the
   receiver at the remote customer site) and carries the IP Router Alert
   option, in accordance with [RFC2205].  The ingress PE must recognize
   the router alert, intercept these messages and process them as RSVP
   signalling messages.

   As noted above, there is an issue in recognizing Path messages as
   they arrive at the egress PE (PE 2 in Figure 1).  The approach
   defined here is to address the Path messages sent by the ingress PE
   directly to the egress PE; that is, rather than using the ultimate
   receiver's destination address as the destination address of the Path
   message, we use the loopback address of the egress PE as the
   destination address of the Path message.  This approach has the
   advantage that it does not require any new data plane capabilities
   for the egress PE beyond those of a standard BGP/MPLS VPN PE.
   Details of the processing of this message at the egress PE are
   described below in Section 3.2.  The approach of addressing a Path
   message directly to an RSVP next hop that is not the next IP hop is
   already used in other environments such as those of [RFC4206] and
   [RFC4804].

   For an RSVP Path message, the existing SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE
   objects can no longer uniquely identify a flow on VPN PE nodes.  We
   propose a new format of SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects which
   contain a VPN-IPv4 format address.  The ingress and egress PE nodes
   translate between the regular IPv4 addresses for messages to and from
   the CE, and VPN-IPv4 addresses for messages to and from PE routers.

   The details of operation at the ingress PE are as follows.  When the
   ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1) receives a Path message from CE1 that is
   addressed to the receiver, the VRF that is associated with the
   incoming interface is identified, just as for normal data path
   operations.  The Path state for the session is stored, and is
   associated with that VRF, so that potentially overlapping addresses
   among different VPNs do not appear to belong to the same session.
   The destination address of the receiver is looked up in the
   appropriate VRF, and the BGP Next-Hop for that destination is
   identified.  That next-hop is the egress PE (PE2 in Figure 1).  A new
   VPN-IPv4 SESSION object is constructed, containing the Route
   Distinguisher (RD) that is part of the VPN-IPv4 route prefix for this
   destination, and the IPv4 address from the SESSION.  In addition, a



Davie, et al.            Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


   new VPN-IPv4 SENDER_TEMPLATE object is constructed, with the original
   IPv4 address from the incoming SENDER_TEMPLATE plus the RD that is
   used by this PE to advertise that prefix for this customer into the
   VPN.  A new Path message is constructed with a destination address
   equal to the address of the egress PE identified above.  This new
   Path message will contain all the objects from the original Path
   message, replacing the original SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects
   with the new VPN-IPv4 type objects.  The RSVP_HOP object in the Path
   message contains an IP address of the ingress PE.

3.2.  Path Message Processing at Egress PE

   When a Path message arrives at the egress PE, it is addressed to the
   PE itself, and is handed to RSVP for processing.  The router extracts
   the RD and IPv4 address from the VPN-IPv4 SESSION object, and
   determines the local VRF context by finding a matching VPN-IPv4
   prefix with the specified RD that has been advertised by this router
   into BGP.  The entire incoming RSVP message, including the VRF
   information, is stored as part of the Path state.

   Now the RSVP module can construct a Path message which differs from
   the Path it received in the following ways:

   a.  Its destination address is the IP address extracted from the
       SESSION Object;

   b.  The SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects are converted back to
       IPv4-type by discarding the attached RD

   c.  The RSVP_HOP Object contains the IP address of the outgoing
       interface of the egress PE and an LIH, as per normal RSVP
       processing.

   The router then sends the Path message on towards its destination
   over the interface identified above.  This Path message carries the
   IP Router-Alert option as required by [RFC2205].

3.3.  Resv Processing at Egress PE

   When a receiver at the customer site originates a Resv message for
   the session, normal RSVP procedures apply until the Resv, making its
   way back towards the sender, arrives at the "egress" PE (it is
   "egress" with respect to the direction of data flow, i.e.  PE2 in
   figure 1).  On arriving at PE2, the SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects
   in the Resv, and the VRF in which the Resv was received, are used to
   find the matching Path state stored previously.  At this stage,
   admission control can be performed on the PE-CE link.

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


   Assuming admission control is successful, the PE constructs a Resv
   message to send to the RSVP HOP stored in the Path state, i.e., the
   ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1).  The IPv4 SESSION object is replaced
   with the same VPN-IPv4 SESSION object received in the Path.  The IPv4
   FILTER_SPEC object is replaced with a VPN-IPv4 FILTER_SPEC object,
   which copies the VPN-IPv4 address from the SENDER_TEMPLATE received
   in the matching Path message.  The RSVP_HOP in the Resv message
   contains an IP address of the Egress PE that is reachable by the
   ingress PE.  The Resv message is sent to the IP address contained
   within the RSVP_HOP object in the Path message.

   If admission control is not successful, a ResvError message is sent
   towards the receiver as per normal RSVP processing.

3.4.  Resv Processing at Ingress PE

   Upon receiving a Resv message at the ingress PE (with respect to data
   flow, i.e.  PE1 in Figure 1), the PE determines which VRF the session
   is associated with by decoding the RD and IPv4 address in the
   received FILTER_SPEC.  It is now possible to locate the appropriate
   Path state for the reservation, and generate a Resv message to send
   to the appropriate CE.  The Resv message sent to the ingress CE will
   contain IPv4 SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects, derived from the
   appropriate Path state.  Since we assume in this section that
   admission control over the Provider's backbone is not needed, the
   ingress PE does not perform any admission control for this
   reservation.

3.5.  Other RSVP Messages

   Processing of PathError, PathTear, ResvError, ResvTear and ResvConf
   messages is generally straightforward and follows the rules of
   [RFC2205].  These additional rules must be observed for messages
   transmitted within the VPN (i.e. between the PEs):

   o  The SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTER_SPEC objects must be
      converted from IPv4 to VPN-IPv4 form and back in the same manner
      as described above for Path and Resv messages.

   o  The matching state & VRF must be determined by decoding the RD and
      IPv4 addresses in the SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects.

   o  The message must be directly addressed to the appropriate PE,
      without using the IP Router Alert option.

4.  Admission Control in Provider's Backbone

   The preceding section outlines how per-customer reservations can be
   made over the PE-CE links.  This may be sufficient in many situations
   where the backbone is well engineered with ample capacity and there
   is no need to perform any sort of admission control in the backbone.
   However, in some cases where excess capacity cannot be relied upon
   (e.g., during failures or unanticipated periods of overload) it may
   be desirable to be able to perform admission control in the backbone
   on behalf of customer traffic.

   Because of the fact that routes to customer addresses are not present
   in the P routers, along with the concerns of scalability that would
   arise if per-customer reservations were allowed in the P routers, it
   is clearly necessary to map the per-customer reservations described
   in the preceding section onto some sort of aggregate reservations.
   Furthermore, customer data packets need to be tunneled across the
   provider backbone just as in normal BGP/MPLS VPN operation.

   Given these considerations, a feasible way to achieve the objective
   of admission control in the backbone is to use the ideas described in
   [RFC4804].  MPLS-TE tunnels can be established between PEs as a means
   to perform aggregate admission control in the backbone.

   An MPLS-TE tunnel from an ingress PE to an egress PE can be thought
   of as a virtual link of a certain capacity.  The main change to the
   procedures described above is that when a Resv is received at the
   ingress PE, an admission control decision can be performed by
   checking whether sufficient capacity of that virtual link remains
   available to admit the new customer reservation.  We note also that
   [RFC4804] uses the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object to identify the tunnel
   across the backbone, rather than the simple RSVP_HOP object described
   in Section 3.1.  The procedures of [RFC4804] should be followed here
   as well.

   To achieve effective admission control in the backbone, there needs
   to be some way to separate the data plane traffic that has a
   reservation from that which does not.  We assume that packets that
   are subject to admission control on the core will be given a
   particular MPLS EXP value, and that no other packets will be allowed
   to enter the core with this value unless they have passed admission
   control.  Some fraction of link resources will be allocated to queues
   on core links for packets bearing that EXP value, and the MPLS-TE
   tunnels will use that resource pool to make their constraint-based
   routing and admission control decisions.  This is all consistent with
   the principles of aggregate RSVP reservations described in [RFC3175].

5.  Inter-AS operation

   [RFC4364] defines three modes of inter-AS operation for MPLS/BGP
   VPNs, referred to as options A, B and C. In the following sections we
   describe how the scheme described above can operate in each inter-AS
   environment.

5.1.  Inter-AS Option A

   Option A is quite straightforward.  Each ASBR operates like a PE, and
   the ASBR-ASBR links can be viewed as PE-CE links in terms of
   admission control.  If the procedures defined in Section 3 are
   enabled on both ASBRs, then CAC may be performed on the inter-ASBR
   links.  In addition, the operator of each AS can independently decide
   whether or not to perform CAC across his backbone.  The new objects
   described in this document MUST NOT be sent in any RSVP message
   between two Option-A ASBRs.

5.2.  Inter-AS Option B

   To support inter-AS Option B, we require some additional processing
   of RSVP messages on the ASBRs.  Recall that, when packets are forward
   from one AS to another in option B, the VPN label is swapped by each
   ASBR as a packet goes from one AS to another.  The BGP next hop seen
   by the ingress PE will be the ASBR, and there need not be IP
   visibility between the ingress and egress PEs.  Hence when the
   ingress PE sends the Path message to the BGP next hop of the VPN-IPv4
   route towards the destination, it will be received by the ASBR.  The
   ASBR determines the next hop of the route in a similar way as the
   ingress PE - by finding a matching BGP VPN-IPv4 route with the same
   RD and a matching prefix.

   The provider(s) who interconnect ASes using option B may or may not
   desire to perform admission control on the inter-AS links.  This
   choice affects the detailed operation of ASBRs.  We describe the two
   modes of operation - with and without admission control at the ASBRs
   - in the following sections.

5.2.1.  Admission control on ASBR

   In this scenario, the ASBR performs full RSVP signalling and
   admission control.  The RSVP database is indexed on the ASBR using
   the VPN-IPv4 SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTER_SPEC objects (which
   uniquely identify RSVP sessions and flows as per the requirements of
   [RFC2205]).  These objects are forwarded unmodified in both
   directions by the ASBR.  All other procedures of RSVP are performed
   as if the ASBR was a RSVP hop.  In particular, the RSVP_HOP objects
   sent in Path and Resv messages contain IP addresses of the ASBR,



Davie, et al.            Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


   which MUST be reachable by the neighbor to whom the message is being
   sent.  Note that since the VPN-IPv4 SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and
   FILTER_SPEC objects satisfy the uniqueness properties required for a
   RSVP database implementation as per [RFC2209], no customer VRF
   awareness is required on the ASBR.

5.2.2.  No admission control on ASBR

   If the ASBR is not doing admission control, it is desirable that per-
   flow state not be maintained on the ASBR.  This requires adjacent
   RSVP hops (i.e. the ingress and egress PEs of the respective ASes) to
   send RSVP messages directly between them.  Not however that such
   routers in an Option B environment are not required to have direct IP
   reachability to each other.  To mitigate this issue, we propose the
   use of label switching to forward RSVP messages from a PE in one AS
   to a PE in another AS.  A detailed description of how this is
   achieved follows.

   We first define a new VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object.  Use of the VPN-IPv4
   RSVP_HOP object enables RSVP control plane reachability between any
   two adjacent RSVP hops in a MPLS VPN, regardless of whether they have
   IP reachability.  RSVP nodes sending Path or Resv messages across a
   MPLS VPN MAY use the VPN-IPv4 PHOP object to achieve signalling
   across Option-B ASBRs without requiring the ASBRs to install state.

   The VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object carries the IPv4 address of the message
   sender and a logical interface handle as before, but in addition
   carries a VPN-IPv4 address which also represents the sender of the
   message.  The message sender MUST also advertise this VPN-IPv4 HOP
   address into BGP with an associated label, and this advertisement
   MUST be propagated by BGP throughout the VPN and to adjacent ASes in
   order to provide reachability to this PE.  Frames received by the PE
   marked with this label MUST be given to the local control plane for
   processing.  This VPN-IPv4 address may be created specially for this
   task, or may represent any VRF, or may be any previously-advertised
   address (e.g. local PE-CE link address).  In the case where the
   address is specially created for control protocols, the BGP
   advertisement SHOULD be marked such that this address is not
   redistributed outside the MPLS VPN (e.g. by using a special route
   target not imported into customer VRFs).

   When the upstream RSVP hop sends a Path message to the ASBR, the ASBR
   looks up the next-hop of a matching BGP route as described
   inSection 3.1, and sends the Path message to the next-hop, without
   modifying any RSVP objects (including the RSVP_HOP).  The downstream
   RSVP hop receives the Path and processes it as described in
   Section 3.2.  When sending the Resv upstream, the downstream RSVP hop
   queries BGP for a next-hop+label for the VPN-IPv4 address in the



Davie, et al.            Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


   PHOP, encapsulates the Resv with that label and sends it upstream.
   This message will be received for control processing directly on the
   RSVP hop upstream of the ASBR.  Further, in the RSVP_HOP object
   contained in the Resv, the downstream hop MUST include a VPN-IPv4
   address advertised by itself into BGP with a label, so that hop-by-
   hop messages in the downstream direction (e.g.  ResvError) can be
   sent directly to it.  Note that the VPN-IPv4 address is only used to
   identify a LSP for neighbor reachability.  The IPv4 address in the
   RSVP_HOP object is used for all other purposes, including neighbor
   matching between Path/Resv and SRefresh messages ([RFC2961]),
   authentication ([RFC2747]), etc.

   The ASBR is not expected to process any other RSVP messages apart
   from the Path message as described above.  The ASBR also does not
   need to store any RSVP state.  Note that any ASBR along the path that
   wishes to do admission control or insert itself into the RSVP
   signalling flow, may do so by writing its own RSVP_HOP object with
   IPv4 and VPN-IPv4 address pointing to itself.

   If an Option-B ASBR receives a RSVP Path message with an IPv4 type
   PHOP, but does not wish to install local state or perform admission
   control for this flow, the ASBR MUST NOT forward the Path message.
   In addition, the ASBR SHOULD send a PathError message of Error Code
   [_TBD_], Error Value [_TBD_], signifying to the upstream RSVP hop
   that the supplied PHOP object is insufficient to provide reachability
   across this VPN.  The upstream node, on receipt of this PathError,
   SHOULD re-send the Path message including a RSVP_HOP of VPN-IPv4
   type.

5.3.  Inter-AS Option C

   Option C is also quite straightforward, because there exists an LSP
   directly from ingress PE to egress PE.  In this case, there is no
   significant difference in operation from the single AS case described
   in Section 3.  Furthermore, if it is desired to provide admission
   control from PE to PE, it can be done by building an inter-AS TE
   tunnel and then using the procedures described in Section 4.


6.  Operation with RSVP disabled

   It is often the case that RSVP will not be enabled on the PE-CE
   links.  In such an environment, a customer may reasonably expect that
   RSVP messages sent into the L3 VPN network should be forwarded just
   like any other IP datagrams.  This transparency is useful when the
   customer wishes to use RSVP within his own sites or perhaps to
   perform admission control on the CE-PE links (in CE->PE direction
   only), without involvement of the PEs.  For this reason, a PE SHOULD



Davie, et al.            Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs               February 2008


   NOT discard or modify RSVP messages sent towards it from a CE when
   RSVP is not enabled on the PE-CE links.  Similarly a PE SHOULD NOT
   discard or modify RSVP messages which are destined for one of its
   attached CEs, even when RSVP is not enabled on those links.  Note
   that the presence of the router alert option in some RSVP messages
   may cause them to be forwarded outside of the normal forwarding path,
   but that the guidance of this paragraph still applies in that case.
   Note also that this guidance applies regardless of whether RSVP-TE is
   used in some, all, or none of the L3VPN network.


7.  Other RSVP procedures

   This section describes modifications to other RSVP procedures
   introduced by MPLS VPNs

7.1.  Refresh overhead reduction

   The following points should be noted regarding RSVP refresh overhead
   reduction ([RFC2961]) across a MPLS VPN:

   o  The hop between the ingress and egress PE of a VPN should be
      considered as traversing one or more non-RSVP hops.  As such, the
      procedures described in Section 5.3 of [RFC2961] relating to non-
      RSVP hops SHOULD be followed.

   o  The source IP address of a SRefresh message MUST match the IPv4
      address signalled in the RSVP_HOP object contained in the
      corresponding Path or Resv message.  The IPv4 address in any
      received VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object MUST be used as the source
      address of that message for this purpose.

7.2.  Cryptographic Authentication

   The following points should be noted regarding RSVP cryptographic
   authentication ([RFC2747]) across a MPLS VPN:

   o  The IPv4 address in any received VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object MUST be
      used as the source address of that message for purposes of
      identifying the security association.

   o  Forwarding of Challenge and Response messages MUST follow the same
      rules as described in for hop-by-hop messages.  Specifically, if
      the originator of a Challenge/Response message has received a VPN-
      IPv4 RSVP_HOP object from the corresponding neighbor, it MUST use
      the label associated with that VPN-IPv4 address in BGP to forward
      the Challenge/Response message.

7.3.  RSVP Aggregation

   [RFC3175] and [RFC4860] describe mechanisms to aggregate multiple
   individual RSVP reservations into a single larger reservation on the
   basis of a common DHCP/PHB for traffic classification.  The following
   points should be noted in this regard:

   o  These procedures apply only in the case where the Aggregator and
      Deaggregator nodes are C/CE devices, and the entire MPLS VPN lies
      within the Aggregation Region.  The case where the PE is also an
      Aggregator/Deaggregator is more complex and not considered in this
      document.

   o  Aggregate RSVP sessions will be treated in the same way as regular
      IPv4 RSVP sessions.  To this end, all the procedures described in
      Section 3 and Section 4 apply to aggregate RSVP sessions.  New
      SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTERSPEC objects are defined in
      [objects].

   o  End-To-End (E2E) RSVP sessions are passed unmodified through the
      MPLS VPN.  These RSVP messages may be identified by their IP
      protocol (RSVP-E2E-IGNORE, 134).  When the ingress PE receives any
      RSVP message with this IP protocol, it MUST process this frame as
      if it is regular customer traffic and ignore any IP Router-Alert
      flags.  The appropriate VPN and transport labels are applied to
      the frame and it is forwarded towards the remote CE.  Note that
      this message will not be received or processed by any other P or
      PE node.

   o  Any SESSION-OF-INTEREST objects (defined in [RFC4860]) are to be
      conveyed unmodified across the MPLS VPN.

7.4.  Support for CE-CE RSVP-TE

   [I-D.kumaki-l3vpn-e2e-rsvp-te-reqts] describes a set of requirements
   for the establishment for CE-CE MPLS LSPs across networks offering an
   L3VPN service.  The requirements specified in that draft are similar
   to those addressed by this document, in that both address the issue
   of handling RSVP requests from customers in a VPN context.  It is
   possible that the solution described here could be adapted to meet
   the requirements of [I-D.kumaki-l3vpn-e2e-rsvp-te-reqts].  This will
   be considered in a separate document.

8.1.  VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 SESSION objects

   The usage of the VPN-IPv4 SESSION Object is described in Section 3.1
   and Section 3.2.  The VPN-IPv4 SESSION object should appear in all
   RSVP messages that ordinarily contain a SESSION object and are sent
   between ingress PE and egress PE in either direction.  The object
   MUST NOT be included in any RSVP messages that are sent outside of
   the provider's backbone (except in the inter-AS option B and C cases,
   as described above, when it may appear on inter-AS links).  The VPN-
   IPv4 address in this object is built by combining the IPv4 address
   from the incoming SESSION with the RD in the BGP advertisement from
   the egress PE for this prefix and customer.

   The VPN-IPv6 SESSION object is analogous to the VPN-IPv4 SESSION
   object, using VPN-IPv6 addresses[RFC4659].

   The formats of the objects are as follows:


         o    VPN-IPv4 SESSION object: Class = 1, C-Type = TBA

              .                                                       .
              /                                                       /

              +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+


   The protocol ID, flags, and DstPort are identical to the IPv4 and
   IPv6 SESSION objects.

8.2.  VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE objects

   The usage of the VPN-IPv4 SENDER_TEMPLATE Object is described in
   Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.  The VPN-IPv4 SENDER_TEMPLATE object
   should appear in all RSVP messages that ordinarily contain a
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object and are sent between ingress PE and egress PE
   in either direction (such as Path, PathError, and PathTear).  The
   object MUST NOT be included in any RSVP messages that are sent
   outside of the provider's backbone (except in the inter-AS option B
   and C cases, as described above, when it may appear on inter-AS
   links).  The VPN-IPv4 address in this object is built by combining
   the IPv4 address from the incoming SENDER_TEMPLATE with the RD in the
   BGP advertisement from the ingress PE for this prefix and customer.
   The format of the object is as follows:

              .                                                       .

   The SrcPort is identical to the IPv4 and IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE
   objects.  The Reserved field must be set to zero on transmit and
   ignored on receipt.

8.3.  VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC objects

   The usage of the VPN-IPv4 FILTER_SPEC Object is described in
   Section 3.3 and Section 3.4.  The VPN-IPv4 FILTER_SPEC object should
   appear in all RSVP messages that ordinarily contain a FILTER_SPEC
   object and are sent between ingress PE and egress PE in either
   direction (such as Resv, ResvError, and ResvTear).  The object MUST
   NOT be included in any RSVP messages that are sent outside of the
   provider's backbone (except in the inter-AS option B and C cases, as
   described above, when it may appear on inter-AS links).  The VPN-IPv4
   address in this object is built by combining the IPv4 address from
   the incoming FILTER_SPEC with the RD in the BGP advertisement from
   the ingress PE for this prefix and customer.

         o    VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC object: Class = 10, C-Type = TBA

              Definition same as VPN-IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE object.


   The protocol ID, flags, and DstPort are identical to the IPv4 and
   IPv6 SESSION objects.

8.4.  VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 RSVP_HOP objects

   Usage of the VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP Object is described in Section 5.2.2.
   The VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object is used to establish signalling
   reachability between RSVP neighbors separated by one or more Option-B
   ASBRs.  This object may appear in all RSVP messages that carry a
   RSVP_HOP object, and that travel between the Ingress and Egress PEs.
   It MUST NOT be included in any RSVP messages that are sent outside of
   the provider's backbone (except in the inter-AS option B and C cases,
   as described above, when it may appear on inter-AS links).  The
   format of the object is as follows:


         o    VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object: Class = 3, C-Type = TBA

8.5.  Aggregated VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 SESSION objects

   The usage of Aggregated VPN-IPv4 SESSION object is described in
   Section 7.3.  The AGGREGATE-VPN-IPv4 SESSION object should appear in
   all RSVP messages that ordinarily contain a AGGREGATE-IPv4 SESSION
   object as defined in [RFC3175] and are sent between ingress PE and
   egress PE in either direction.  The GENERIC-AGGREGATE-VPN-IPv4
   SESSION object should appear in all RSVP messages that ordinarily
   contain a GENERIC-AGGREGATE-IPv4 SESSION object as defined in
   [RFC4860] and are sent between ingress PE and egress PE in either
   direction.  These objects MUST NOT be included in any RSVP messages
   that are sent outside of the provider's backbone (except in the
   inter-AS option B and C cases, as described above, when it may appear
   on inter-AS links).  The processing rules for these objects are
   otherwise identical to those of the VPN-IPv4 SESSION object defined
   in Section 8.1.  The VPN-IPv4 address in this object is built by
   combining the IPv4 address from the incoming SESSION with the RD in
   the BGP advertisement from the egress PE for this prefix and
   customer.  The format of the object is as follows:

   Section 8.3.  The VPN-IPv4 address in this object is built by
   combining the IPv4 address from the incoming FILTER_SPEC with the RD
   in the BGP advertisement from the ingress PE for this prefix and
   customer.  The format of the object is as follows:


      o    AGGREGATE-VPN-IPv4 FILTER_SPEC object:
             Class = 10, C-Type = TBA

           Definition same as AGGREGATE-VPN-IPv4 SENDER_TEMPLATE object.


      o    AGGREGATE-VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC object:
             Class = 10, C-Type = TBA

           Definition same as AGGREGATE-VPN-IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE object.



9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA assignment of new RSVP C-Types to
   accommodate the new objects described in Section 8.  In addition, a
   new PathError code/value is required to identify a signalling
   reachability failure and the need for a VPN-IPv4 or VPN-IPv6 RSVP_HOP
   object as described in Section 5.2.2.


10.  Security Considerations

   [RFC4364] addresses the security considerations of BGP/MPLS VPNs in
   general.  General RSVP security considerations are addressed in
   [RFC2205].  To ensure the integrity of RSVP, the RSVP Authentication
   mechanisms defined in [RFC2747] and [RFC3097]may be used.  These
   protect RSVP message integrity hop-by-hop and provide node
   authentication as well as replay protection, thereby protecting

   against corruption and spoofing of RSVP messages.
   [I-D.behringer-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] discusses
   applicability of various keying approaches for RSVP Authentication.
   We note that the RSVP signaling in MPLS VPN is likely to spread over
   multiple administrative domains (e.g. the service provider operating
   the VPN service, and the customers of the service).  Therefore the
   considerations in [I-D.behringer-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying]
   about inter-domain issues are likely to apply.

   Beyond those general issues, two specific issues are introduced by
   this document: resource usage on PEs, and resource usage in the
   provider backbone.  We discuss these in turn.

   A customer who makes resource reservations on the CE-PE links for his
   sites is only competing for link resources with himself, as in
   standard RSVP, at least in the common case where each CE-PE link is
   dedicated to a single customer.  Thus, from the perspective of the
   CE-PE links, this draft does not introduce any new security issues.
   However, because a PE typically serves multiple customers, there is
   also the possibility that a customer might attempt to use excessive
   computational resources on a PE (CPU cycles, memory etc.) by sending
   large numbers of RSVP messages to a PE.  In the extreme this could
   represent a form of denial-of-service attack.  In order to prevent
   such an attack, a PE should have mechanisms to limit the fraction of
   its processing resources that can be consumed by any one CE or by the
   set of CEs of a given customer.  For example, a PE might implement a
   form of rate limiting on RSVP messages that it receives from each CE.

   The second concern arises only when the service provider chooses to
   offer resource reservation across the backbone, as described in
   Section 4.  In this case, the concern may be that a single customer
   might attempt to reserve a large fraction of backbone capacity,
   perhaps with a co-ordinated effort from several different CEs, thus
   denying service to other customers using the same backbone.
   [RFC4804] provides some guidance on the security issues when RSVP
   reservations are aggregated onto MPLS tunnels, which are applicable
   to the situation described here.  We note that a provider may use
   local policy to limit the amount of resources that can be reserved by
   a given customer from a particular PE, and that a policy server could
   be used to control the resource usage of a given customer across
   multiple PEs if desired.

Appendix A.  Alternatives Considered

   At this stage a number of alternatives to the approach described
   above have been considered.  We document some of the approaches
   considered here to assist future discussion.  None of these has been
   shown to improve upon the approach described above, and the first two
   seem to have significant drawbacks relative to the approach described
   above.

Appendix A.1.  GMPLS UNI approach

   [RFC4208] defines the GMPLS UNI.  In Section 7 the operation of the
   GMPLS UNI in a VPN context is briefly described.  This is somewhat
   similar to the problem tackled in the current document.  The main
   difference is that the GMPLS UNI is primarily aimed at the problem of
   allowing a CE device to request the establishment of an LSP across
   the network on the other side of the UNI.  Hence the procedures in
   [RFC4208] would lead to the establishment of an LSP across the VPN
   provider's network for every RSVP request received, which is not
   desired in this case.

   To the extent possible, the approach described in this document is
   consistent with [RFC4208], while filling in more of the details and
   avoiding the problem noted above.

Appendix A.2.  VRF label approach

   Another approach to solving the problems described here involves the
   use of label switching to ensure that Path, Resv, and other RSVP
   messages are directed to the appropriate VRF.  One challenge with
   such an approach is that [RFC4364] does not require labels to be
   allocated for VRFs, only for customer prefixes, and that there is no
   simple, existing method for advertising the fact that a label is
   bound to a VRF.  If, for example, an ingress PE sent a Path message
   labelled with a VPN label that was advertised by the egress PE for
   the prefix that matches the destination address in the Path, there is
   a risk that the egress PE would simply label-switch the Path directly
   on to the CE without performing RSVP processing.

   A second challenge with this approach is that an IP address needs to
   be associated with a VRF and used as the PHOP address for the Path
   message sent from ingress PE to egress PE.  That address must be
   reachable from the egress PE, and exist in the VRF at the ingress PE.
   Such an address is not always available in today's deployments, so
   this represents at least a change to existing deployment practices.

Appendix A.3.  VRF label plus VRF address approach

   It is possible to create an approach based on that described in the
   previous section which addresses the main challenges of that
   approach.  The basic approach has two parts: (a) define a new BGP
   Extended Community to tag a route (and its associated MPLS label) as
   pointing to a VRF; (b) allocate a "dummy" address to each VRF,
   specifically to be used for routing RSVP messages.  The dummy address
   (which could be anything, e.g. a loopback of the associated PE) would
   be used as a PHOP for Path messages and would serve as the
   destination for Resv messages but would not be imported into VRFs of
   any other PE.
