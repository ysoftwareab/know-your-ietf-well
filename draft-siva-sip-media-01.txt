Abstract 

   This draft presents a requirement and proposes a solution to 
   integration of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to the Real Time 
   Streaming Protocol (RTSP and RTSP v2) [RFC 2326 and IDRTSP] 
   especially in the context of converged media services or IPTV 
   services. The document develops a rationale for using SIP with 
   streaming media applications. One service on top of IPTV service is 
   sketched out, which required SIP optimally.

1. Introduction 

   Internet Protocol based Television services (IPTV) are gaining 
   popularity in telecom business circle specially telecom vendors and 
   telecom operators. This service gives high revenue to telecom 
   operators, in turn to telecom vendors, which lose revenue in the 
   traditional voice services. In user point of view, they are able to 
   access high quality video easily using IPTV. High penetration of 
   broadband connectivity, improvement of multimedia codecs, and 
   deployment of flexible triple play service delivery architecture by 
   the operators contribute to the success of IPTV. This growth imposes 
   challenging new requirements for converged media services in terms 
   of flexibility and efficiency.  

   In order to realize the IPTV services based on IMS, IMS user deploys 
   minimum four protocols such as HTTP, RTP, RTSP and SIP. One of the 
   hurdles today to deliver the SIP services over corporate networks is 
   firewall and NAT traversal. Opening the network other than 
   HTTP/HTTPS still is a question for a network administrator. In some 
   cases, opening the network for RTP and SIP is achieved using SIP and 
   RTP aware firewall or session border controller. Rather than one 
   opening for RTSP, it is desirable to have one unified session 
   control protocol. In client side, having separate persistent 
   connectivity for RTSP, SIP and RTP is not advisable in terms of 
   performance. Therefore, reducing the number of protocol is a right 
   option. At last in the context of IMS based IPTV architecture, SIP 
   is used to manage the session. Extending SIP to manage the media 
   control is a viable solution than deploying other protocol for media 
   control.   

   This document proposes rational for using SIP for a signaling 
   protocol for streaming media applications. 

    

   Note: The purpose of this document is to propose in detail one 
   specific approach to using SIP for streaming-media applications. And, 
   our intent is to stimulate discussion within the IETF community and 
   catalyze future work in this area. To this end, our strategy has 
   been to  

   o develop the rationale for using SIP  

   o evaluate, at a high-level, a SIP in the context of converged 
     media services, and

                    SIP extensions for media control          July 2009 
    

   o identify, if appropriate, the future developments. 

2. Terminology 

   See [RFC3261] and [RFC2326] for terminology. 

   In addition the following terms are defined: Trick Play: Play, stop, 
   pause, restart and fast forward of streaming media. 

    

   Note: we also use several terminologies in [TS182027] in order to 
   explain architectural aspects of IPTV and IMS. 

    

3. Use Case Scenario 

   This section describes one value added services on top of streaming 
   media application - use case scenario. This scenario illustrates the 
   variety of conditions and Environments in which streaming media 
   application needs to operate. 

3.1. Scope 

   The scope of streaming media applications for this document includes 
   applications with the following characteristics: content-on-demand, 
   streaming media, unicast-media streams, live or recorded content, 
   ubiquitous access (any-device, any-access). 

   Explicit exclusions include non-streaming (e.g., downloaded media); 
   though of interest this is out of scope for the present document. 

3.2. Use Case 

   Use cases are used with the purpose of clarifying the "streaming 
   media Application" and to explore the space of applications. The 
   objective is to 

   o clarify the frame / scope the discussion 

   o illustrate some of usage scenarios 

   o identify some of the key attributes that characterize these 
     Scenario - Advertisement/Recommendation Services

   Information of relevant videos (recommendation) or advertisement 
   need to be displayed on the screen of video display when user pauses 
   video session or video content is about to finish. 

    

4. Proposed solution using SIP for both session and media control  

4.1. Overview of proposed solution 

   SIP is used to setup or modify or terminating a session. In addition, 
   SIP UPDATE allows a client to update parameters of session.    

   The solution needs to satisfy the requirements for session setup, 
   media setup and media control. Session setup and media setup are 
   carried out using INVITE message. Trick plays and media control 
   features is mapped to the SIP message, which is UPDATE method. Media 
   control message such as play, pause is transferred from UE using 
   UPDATE message. Therefore, the semantics of SIP session is not 
   changed. 

   In order to differentiate many media control messages, SIP-MEX - new 
   header is defined and included into UPDATE message. 

   Even though, trick plays and media control features has to be 
   handled by SIP, some information has to be passed back to UE from 
   network when some events happen such as pause. Therefore, new header 
   (SIP-MEX) in UPDATE method with new XML body is used in our proposed 
   solution for tricks plays and media control features. This criterion 
   is used to select the UPDATE method. SIP-MEX is not standardized and 
   is used for carrying the media event information.  

   SIP session typically follows the cycle of many session-media states. 
   Session-media states are started, paused, restarted, and end. 
   Restarted happens after media pauses. Mostly, UPDATE is used to 
   change session media state. It means when session is started, 
   issuing an UPDATE command can trigger the state from started to 
   paused. Likewise, paused state can be trigged to restarted state by 
   UPDATE command. These UPDATE will not change the session parameters 
   instead change session-media state of a session. 

   UPDATE will contain SIP-MEX header with value: pause/restart. One 
   important change is that content-type is application/XML not SDP. 
   When UPDATE message is sent from UAC to UAS, it will carry new SIP 
   header called as SIP-MEX. The content type of the response message 
   is XML, which is simple and flexible enough to change. .

                    SIP extensions for media control          July 2009 
    

   Main difficulty is how to identify that both ends support UPDATE 
   message and understand session-media state. According to RFC 3261, 
   Allow header in the initial invite message and its response can be 
   used to verify that both end supports UPDATE message. Session-media 
   state is understandable by UAS if UAS insert SIP-MEX header into the 
   response of UPDATE message which has SIP-MEX initially.   

   The fast forward and fast backward can be added into session-media 
   states. Parameters, which describe the fast forward and fast 
   backward, can be sent in XML via UPDATE message. In this document, 
   efforts are not devoted to discuss about these cases. 

    

4.2. Demonstration 

   The proposed solution is demonstrated in IPTV context, whose 
   architecture is defined in [TS182027].Our mechanisms mainly work 
   within UE and SCF in the IPTV services. When UE sends the UPDATE 
   message with Pause details, SCF replies with information, which is 
   going to be displayed. Information of trick functions is sent in SIP 
   body. In reply, XML info is sent back to the UE. Based on the 
   unified session control protocol, IPTV architecture will have one 
   modification, which is removing the Xc interface between UE and IPTV 
   media control function. It is not focus of this document.  

   Based on the design, SCF behaves in UA mode and coordinates the MCF 
   via y2 interface. Details of the interface between SCF and MCF are 
   not discussed here. Optionally, SCF can perform in B2BUA mode 
   between user and MCF. In this case, MCF should be SIP aware. These 
   two options are used; because connectivity to MCF and MDF depends on 
   content provider’s ability.  

   SCF implements the function, which is responsible to send 
   information (advertisement/recommendation) to the UE when Pause 
   event arrived. Moreover, way the SCF finds the information or 
   advertisement is beyond the scope, SCF may use semantic web services 
   and context enabler services. In the trick function, for example 
   Pause event, UE will send the UPDATE message with SIP-MEX header, 
   which contains of PAUSE event. In response, OK message will carry 
   relevant information in XML format to UE.

4.3. Detailed procedures of Session and media control 

   In the context of on demand service, scenario can be explained as 
   follows. User selects the corresponding the media content from UE, 
   which is identified by URI. Let assume that address of the media 
   content is movie1@vod.ims.eu. 

   Once SCF receive the INVITE message, SCF instruct the media content 
   delivery function to deliver the media. SCF may have one or two 
   different interfaces to the media content delivery function. 

   In Figure 1, SCF is connected to MCF using non-SIP protocol. When 
   Pause happens in UE, UE directly send UPDATE message to SCF. OK 
   message is sent to directly to UE with XML information. Since Figure 
   1 does not show full description of message flow, important message 
   is shown in dotted line.

   protocol 

    

   Alternatively, connectivity between SCF and MCF can be SIP enabled. 
   In this case, SCF can behave like B2BUA or proxy mode, but we choose 
   B2BUA. Because SCF needs to send some information as response to UE 
   when pause event happened. In the proxy mode, MCF will generate the 
   OK response and SCF cannot modify the SDP of the OK message. This 
   model can be used when MCF is responsible to deliver advertisement 
   or information to UE. Alternative scenario, where SCF is in B2BUA 
   and SCF is connected to MCF via SIP interface, is clearly shown in 
   Figure 2.

5. Alternative solution spaces for proposed use-cases 

      

   o In ordinary case, media control event can be passed to IMS 
     provider by the content provider and then IPTV application 
     triggers the SIP Push to send the information to UE.

   o Second solution is that SIP is for session management and RTSP is 
     for media signaling. When user pause the VOD service, client can 
     pull information from web server according to currently watching 
     video information. But on the other hand, using proposed unified 
     session control protocol, one advantage is that both ends can 
     send the information to each other compared to HTTP. It means 
     that network enable pause is possible. Even if network enabled 
     pause takes place, server can send information to client in 
     UPDATE message.  

6. Advantages 

   o IMS based Telco become an efficient context provider who may know 
     the media control. 

   o Easy to implement: Our solution tries to push information to 
     screen where already existing TV is displaying the video. 
     Therefore, we use same dialog (UPDATE/OK) to carry this push 
     information. 

   o This method is relatively simple and easy to adopt in the SIP 
     environment.
