1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module which contains Textual Conventions
   for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These Textual
   Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage MPLS
   networks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   For an introduction to the concepts of MPLS, see [RFC3031].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

                 (RFC3031),  (RFC3032), (RFC3034), (RFC3035) and
                 (RFCxxxx).

                 The label contents are specific to the label being
                 represented, such as:

                 * The label carried in an MPLS shim header
                   (for LDP this is the Generic Label) is a 20-bit
                   number represented by 4 octets. Bits 0-19 contain
                   a label or a reserved label value.  Bits 20-31
                   MUST be zero.

                   The following is quoted directly from (RFC3032).
                   There are several reserved label values:

                      i. A value of 0 represents the
                         'IPv4 Explicit NULL Label'. This label
                         value is only legal at the bottom of the
                         label stack.  It indicates that the label
                         stack must be popped, and the forwarding
                         of the packet must then be based on the
                         IPv4 header.

                     ii. A value of 1 represents the
                         'Router Alert Label'.  This label value is
                         legal anywhere in the label stack except at
                         the bottom.  When a received packet
                         contains this label value at the top of
                         the label stack, it is delivered to a
                         local software module for processing.
                         The actual forwarding of the packet
                         is determined by the label beneath it
                         in the stack.  However, if the packet is
                         forwarded further, the Router Alert Label
                         should be pushed back onto the label stack
                         before forwarding.  The use of this label
                         is analogous to the use of the
                         'Router Alert Option' in IP packets
                         (RFC2113). Since this label
                         cannot occur at the bottom of the stack,
                         it is not associated with a
                         particular network layer protocol.

                    iii. A value of 2 represents the
                         'IPv6 Explicit NULL Label'. This label
                         value is only legal at the bottom of the

                         label stack.  It indicates that the label
                         stack must be popped, and the forwarding
                         of the packet must then be based on the
                         IPv6 header.

                     iv. A value of 3 represents the
                         'Implicit NULL Label'.
                         This is a label that an LSR may assign and
                         distribute, but which never actually
                         appears in the encapsulation.  When an
                         LSR would otherwise replace the label
                         at the top of the stack with a new label,
                         but the new label is 'Implicit NULL',
                         the LSR will pop the stack instead of
                         doing the replacement.  Although
                         this value may never appear in the
                         encapsulation, it needs to be specified in
                         the Label Distribution Protocol, so a value
                         is reserved.

                      v. Values 4-15 are reserved.

                 * The frame relay label can be either 10-bits or
                   23-bits depending on the DLCI field size and the
                   upper 22-bits or upper 9-bits must be zero,
                   respectively.

                 * For an ATM label the lower 16-bits represents the
                   VCI, the next 12-bits represents the VPI and the
                   remaining bits MUST be zero.

                 * The Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) label contains a
                   value greater than 2^24-1 and used in GMPLS
                   as defined in (RFCxxxx)."

             STATUS        current
             DESCRIPTION
                "A unique identifier within an MPLS network that is
                 assigned to each LSP. This is assigned at the head
                 end of the LSP and can be used by all LSRs
                 to identify this LSP.  This value is piggybacked by
                 the signaling protocol when this LSP is signaled
                 within the network. This identifier can then be
                 used at each LSR to identify which labels are
                 being swapped to other labels for this LSP.  This
                 object  can also be used to disambiguate LSPs that
                 share the same RSVP sessions between the same
                 source and destination.

                 For LSPs established using CR-LDP, the LSPID is
                 composed of the ingress LSR Router ID (or any of
                 its own IPv4 addresses) and a locally unique
                 CR-LSP ID to that LSR. The first two bytes carry
                 the CR-LSPID, and the remaining 4 bytes carry
                 the Router ID. The LSPID is useful in network
                 management, in CR-LSP repair, and in using
                 an already established CR-LSP as a hop in
                 an ER-TLV.

                   For LSPs signaled using RSVP-TE, the LSP ID is
                   defined as a 16-bit (2 byte) identifier used
                   in the SENDER_TEMPLATE and the FILTER_SPEC
                   that can be changed to allow a sender to
                   share resources with itself. The length of this
                   object should only be 2 or 6 bytes. If the length
                   of this octet string is 2 bytes, then it must
                   identify an RSVP-TE LSPID, or it is 6 bytes,
                   it must contain a CR-LDP LSPID."

                 implementation.

                 Implementations must ensure that TeHopAddressType
                 objects and any dependent objects
                 (e.g. TeHopAddress objects) are consistent.
                 An inconsistentValue error must be generated
                 if an attempt to change a TeHopAddressType
                 object would, for example, lead to an
                 undefined TeHopAddress value that is
                 not defined herein.  In particular,
                 TeHopAddressType/TeHopAddress pairs
                 must be changed together if the address
                 type changes (e.g. from ipv6(2) to ipv4(1))."

             STATUS     current
             DESCRIPTION
                "Denotes a generic Tunnel hop address,
                 that is, the address of a node which
                 an LSP traverses, including the source
                 and destination nodes.  An address may be
                 very concrete, for example, an IPv4 host
                 address (i.e., with prefix length 32);
                 if this IPv4 address is an interface
                 address, then that particular interface
                 must be traversed.  An address may also
                 specify an 'abstract node', for example,
                 an IPv4 address with prefix length
                 less than 32, in which case, the LSP
                 can traverse any node whose address
                 falls in that range.  An address may
                 also specify an Autonomous System (AS),
                 in which  case the LSP can traverse any
                 node that falls within that AS.

                 A TeHopAddress value is always interpreted within
                 the context of an TeHopAddressType value.  Every
                 usage of the TeHopAddress TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
                 is required to specify the TeHopAddressType object
                 which provides the context.  It is suggested that
                 the TeHopAddressType object is logically registered
                 before the object(s) which use the TeHopAddress
                 TEXTUAL-CONVENTION if they appear in the

6.  Security Considerations


   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MPLS
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects. Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the transmission
   branch, that is, assign the mplsStdMIB under { transmission 166 }.
   This sub-id is requested because 166 is the ifType for mpls(166) and
   is available under transmission.

   In the future, MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to manage
   that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards
   Action as specified in [RFC2434].

   This document also requests IANA to assign { mplsStdMIB 1 } to the
   MPLS-TC-STD-MIB specified in this document.
