                  Concise Reference Integrity Manifest
                      draft-birkholz-rats-corim-01

Abstract

   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to put
   trust in the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to
   decide if to engage in secure interactions with it - or not.
   Evidence about trustworthiness can be rather complex, voluminous or
   Attester-specific.  As it is deemed unrealistic that every Relying
   Party is capable of the appraisal of Evidence, that burden is taken
   on by a Verifier.  In order to conduct Evidence appraisal procedures,
   a Verifier requires not only fresh Evidence from an Attester, but
   also trusted Endorsements and Reference Values from Endorsers, such
   as manufacturers, distributors, or owners.  This document specifies
   Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM) that represent
   Endorsements and Reference Values in CBOR format.  Composite devices
   or systems are represented by a collection of Concise Module
   Identifiers (CoMID) and Concise Software Identifiers (CoSWID) bundled
   in a CoRIM document.

1.  Introduction

   The Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] describes appraisal procedures for
   attestation Evidence and Attestation Results.  Appraisal procedures
   for Evidence are conducted by Verifiers and are intended to assess
   the trustworthiness of a remote peer.  Appraisal procedures for
   Attestation Results are conducted by Relying Parties and are intended
   to operationalize the assessment about a remote peer and to act
   appropriately based on the assessment.  In order to enable their
   intent, appraisal procedures consume Appraisal Policies, Reference
   Values, and Endorsements.

   This documents specifies a binary encoding for Reference Values using
   the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).  The encoding is
   based on three parts that are defined using the Concise Data
   Definition Language (CDDL):

   *  Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM),

   *  Concise Module Identifiers (CoMID), and

   *  Concise Software Identifier (CoSWID).

   CoRIM and CoMID tags are defined in this document, CoSWID tags are
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid].  CoRIM provide a wrapper
   structure, in which CoMID tags, CoSWID tags, as well as corresponding
   metadata can be bundled and signed as a whole.  CoMID tags represent
   hardware components and provide a counterpart to CoSWID tags, which
   represent software components.

   In accordance to [RFC4949], software components that are stored in
   hardware modules are referred to as firmware.  While firmware can be
   represented as a software component, it is also very hardware-
   specific and often resides directly on block devices instead of a
   file system.  In this specification, firmware and their Reference
   Values are represented via CoMID tags.  Reference Values for any
   other software components stored on a file system are represented via
   CoSWID tags.

   In addition to CoRIM - and respective CoMID tags - this specification
   defines a Concise Manifest Revocation that represents a list of
   reference to CoRIM that are actively marked as invalid before their
   expiration time.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Concise Reference Integrity Manifests

   This section specifies the Concise RIM (CoRIM) format, the Concise
   MID format (CoMID), and the extension to the CoSWID specification
   that augments CoSWID tags to express specific relationships to CoMID
   tags.

Internet-Draft                    CoRIM                        July 2021


   While each specification defines its own start rule, only CoMID and
   CoSWID are stand-alone specifications.  The CoRIM specification - as
   the bundling format - has a dependency on CoMID and CoSWID and is not
   a stand-alone specification.

   While stand-alone CoSWID tags may be signed [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid],
   CoMID tags are not intended to be stand-alone and are always part of
   a CoRIM that must be signed.  [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid] specifies the
   use of COSE [RFC7231] for signing.  This specification defines how to
   generate singed CoRIM tags with COSE to enable proof of authenticity
   and temper-evidence.

   This document uses the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL
   [RFC8610]) to define the data structure of CoRIM and CoMID tags, as
   well as the extensions to CoSWID.  The CDDL definitions provided
   define nested containers.  Typically, the CDDL types used for nested
   containers are maps.  Every key used in the maps is a named type that
   is associated with an corresponding uint via a block of rules
   appended at the end of the CDDL definition.

   Every set of uint keys that is used in the context of the "collision
   domain" of map is intended to be collision-free (each key is intended
   to be unique in the scope of a map, not a multimap).  To accomplish
   that, for each map there is an IANA registry for the map members of
   maps.

2.1.  Typographical Conventions

   Type names in the following CDDL definitions follow the naming
   convention illustrated in table Table 1.

2.2.  Prefixes and Namespaces

   The semantics of the information elements (attributes) defined for
   CoRIM, CoMID tags, and CoSWID tags are sometimes very similar, but
   often do not share the same scope or are actually quite different.
   In order to not overload the already existing semantics of the
   software-centric IANA registries of CoSWID tags with, for example,
   hardware-centric semantics of CoMID tags, new type names are
   introduced.  For example: both CoSWID tags and CoMID tags define a
   tag-id.  As CoSWID already specifies "tag-id", the tag-id in CoMID
   tags is prefixed with "comid." to disambiguate the context, resulting
   in "comid.tag-id".  This prefixing provides a well-defined scope for
   the use of the types defined in this document and guarantees
   interoperability (no type name collisions) with the CoSWID CDDL
   definition.  Effectively, the prefixes used in this specification
   enable simple hierarchical namespaces.  The prefixing introduced is
   also based on the anticipated namespace features for CDDL.

2.3.  Extensibility

   Both the CoRIM and the CoMID tag specification include extension
   points using CDDL sockets (see [RFC8610] Section 3.9).  The use of
   CDDL sockets allows for well-formed extensions to be defined in
   supplementary CDDL definitions that support additional uses of CoRIM
   and CoMID tags.

   There are two types of extensibility supported via the extension
   points defined in this document.  Both types allow for the addition
   of keys in the scope of a map.

   Custom Keys:  The CDDL definition allows for the use of negative
      integers as keys.  These keys cannot take on a well-defined global
      semantic.  They can take on custom-defined semantics in a limited
      or local scope, e.g. vendor-defined scope.

   Registered Keys:  Additional keys can be registered at IANA via
      separate specifications.

   Both types of extensibility also allow for the definition of new
   nested maps that again can include additional defined keys.

2.4.  Concise RIM Extension Points

   The following CDDL sockets (extension points) are defined in the
   CoRIM specification, which allow the addition of new information
   structures to their respective CDDL groups.

2.5.  CDDL Generic Types

   The CDDL definitions for CoRIM and CoMID tags use the two following
   generic types.

2.5.1.  Non-Empty

   The non-empty generic type is used to express that a map with only
   optional members MUST at least include one of the optional members.

   non-empty<M> = (M) .within ({ + any => any })

2.5.2.  One-Or-More

   The one-or-more generic type allows to omit an encapsulating array,
   if only one member would be present.

   one-or-more<T> = T / [ 2* T ] ; 2*

3.  Concise RIM Data Definition

   A CoRIM is a bundle of CoMID tags and/or CoSWID tags that can
   reference each other and that includes additional metadata about that
   bundle.

   The root of the CDDL specification provided for CoRIM is the rule

   Security Considerations

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has a number of IANA considerations, as described in
   the following subsections.  In summary, 6 new registries are
   established with this request, with initial entries provided for each
   registry.  New values for 5 other registries are also requested.

7.1.  COSE Header Parameters Registry

   The 'corim metadata' parameter has been added to the "COSE Header
   Parameters" registry:

   *  Name: 'corim metadata'

   *  Label: 11

   *  Value: corim-meta-map

   *  Description: Provides a map of additional metadata for a CoRIM
      payload composed of (1) one or more entities that created or
      signed the corresponding CoRIM and (2) its period of validity

   *  Reference: 'corim-meta-map' in {model-corim-meta-map} of this
      document

7.2.  CoRIM Map Items Registry

   This document defines a new registry titled "CoRIM Map".  The
   registry uses integer values as index values for items in 'unsigned-
   corim-map' CBOR maps.

   Security considerations: See Section 6 of RFC-AAAA.

   Interoperability considerations: Applications MAY ignore any key
   value pairs that they do not understand.  This allows backwards
   compatible extensions to this specification.

   Published specification: RFC-AAAA

   Applications that use this media type: The type is used by remote
   attestation procedures, supply chain integrity management systems,
   vulnerability assessment systems, and in applications that rely on
   trustworthy endorsements and reference values describing the intended
   operational state of a system.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
   application/rim+cbor is supported by using fragment identifiers as
   specified by Section 9.5 of [RFC8949].

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s): first five bytes in hex: 43 4f 52 49 4d

   File extension(s): corim

   Macintosh file type code(s): none

   Macintosh Universal Type Identifier code: org.ietf.corim conforms to
   public.data

   Person & email address to contact for further information: Henk
