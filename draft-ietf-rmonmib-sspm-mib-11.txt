Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring Synthetic Sources
   for Performance Monitoring (SSPM) algorithms.

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


   In particular, it defines a method of describing Synthetic Sources
   for Performance Monitoring (SSPM). This is useful within the RMON
   framework for performance monitoring in the cases where it is
   desirable to inject packets into the network for the purpose of
   monitoring their performance with the other MIBs in that framework.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3. Overview

   This document defines a MIB module for the purpose of remotely
   controlling synthetic sources (or 'active' probes) and sinks for the
   purpose of enhancing remote performance monitoring capabilities
   within IP networks and services.  Much work within the IETF exists
   related to performance monitoring.  One interesting aspect of this
   body of work is that it does not explicitly define an 'active' probe
   capability.  An active probe capability is complimentary to existing
   capabilities, and this MIB module is developed to fill this void.

   3.1 Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

      o 'Performance monitoring' is the act of monitoring traffic for
      the purpose of evaluating a statistic of a metric related to the
      performance of the system.  A performance monitoring system is
      comprised of a) traffic generators, b) measurement, c) data
      reduction, and d) reporting.  The traffic generators may be
      natural sources, synthetic sources or intrusive sources.

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


      o A 'synthetic source' is a device or an embedded software program
      which generates a data packet (or packets) and injects it (them)
      onto the path to a corresponding probe or existing server solely
      in support of a performance monitoring function.  A synthetic
      source may talk intrusively to existing application servers.

   The design goals for this MIB module are:

      o Compliment the overall performance management architecture being
      defined within the RMONMIB WG, refer to the RMONMIB framework
      document [RFC3577].  This MIB module is defined within the context
      of the APM-MIB [RFCXXX1].

      o Extensibility - the MIB module should be easily extended to
      include a greater set of protocols and applications for
      performance monitoring purposes.

      o Flexible - it should support both round trip and one way
      measurements.

      o Security - the control of the source and sink of traffic is
      handled by a management application and communication is
      recommended via SNMPv3.

   This document is organized as follows.  The next section discusses
   the relationship of this MIB module to other MIB modules from the
   RMONMIB and DISMAN working groups.  Then the structure of the MIB
   module is discussed.  Finally, the MIB module definitions are given.

4. Relationship to other MIB modules

   This MIB module is designed to be used in conjunction with the RMON
   MIB Working Groups two other MIB modules for application performance
   measurement: Application Performance Measurement MIB [RFCXXX1] and
   Transport Performance Metrics MIB [RFCXXX2].  These MIB modules
   define reporting capabilities for that framework.  The intent of this
   MIB module is to define a method for injecting packets into the
   network utilizing probe capabilities defined in the base MIB modules
   and measured with the reporting MIB modules.  other reporting MIB
   modules may be used as well.

   Specifically, this MIB module uses the AppLocalIndex as defined in
   the APM-MIB to map measurement configuration information to
   definition and reporting structures defined in the APM-MIB.

5. Relationship to Other Work

   Much work has already occurred within the IETF which has a direct

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


   bearing on the development of active performance probe definitions.
   This body of work is addressed in various working groups over the
   years.  In this section we focus our attention to the work of a) the
   IPPM working group, b) the DISMAN working group, c) the RMON working
   group, d) the ApplMIB working group, and e) the RTFM working group.

5.1 IPPM

   The IPPM working group has defined in detail a set of performance
   metrics, sampling techniques and associated statistics for transport-
   level, or connectivity-level, measurements.  The IPPM framework
   document [RFC2330] discusses numerous issues around sampling
   techniques, clock accuracy, resolution and skew, wire time versus
   host time, error analysis, etc.  Much of these are considerations for
   Configuration and Implementation Issues discussed below.  The IPPM
   working group has defined several metrics and their associated
   statistics, including

      + a connectivity metric [RFC2678]

      + one-way delay metric [RFC2679]

      + one-way loss metric [RFC2680]

      + round trip delay and loss metrics [RFC2681]

      + delay variation metric [RFC3393]

      + a streaming media metric [RFC3432]

      + a throughput metric [EBT] and [TBT], and

      + others are under development.

   These (or a subset) could form the basis for a set of active,
   connectivity-level, probe types designed for the purpose of
   monitoring the quality of transport services.  A consideration of
   some of these metrics may form a set of work activities and a set of
   early deliverables out of a group developing an active probe
   capability.

   During the early development of the SSPM-MIB, it became apparent that
   a one-way measurement protocol was required in order for the SSPM-MIB
   to control a one-way measurement.  This led to the current work with
   the IPPM WG on the development of the One-Way Measurement Protocol
   (OWDP) [ODP].  This protocol work includes both the measurement
   protocol itself, as well as the development of a separate control
   protocol.  This later control protocol is redundant with the current

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


   work on the SSPM-MIB.  The SSPM-MIB could be used as an alternative
   to the one-way delay control protocol.

5.2 DISMAN

   The DISMAN working group has defined a set of 'active' tools for
   remote management.  Of relevance to this draft are:

      + the pingMIB [RFC2925],

      + the DNS Lookup MIB [RFC2925],

      + the tracerouteMIB [RFC2925],

      + the scriptMIB [RFC3165], and

      + the expressionMIB [RFC2982].

   The pingMIB and tracerouteMIB define an active probe capability,
   primarily for the remote determination of path and path connectivity.
   There are some performance related metrics collected from the pingMIB
   and one could conceivably use these measurements for the evaluation
   of a limited set of performance statistics.  But there is a
   fundamental difference in determining connectivity versus determining
   the quality of that connectivity.  However, in the context of
   performance monitoring, a fault can be viewed as not performing at
   all.  Therefore, they should both be monitored with the same probes
   to reduce network traffic.

   The DNS Lookup MIB also includes some probe-like capabilities and
   performance time measurements for the DNS lookup.  This could be used
   to suggest details of a related session-level, active probe.

   The scriptMIB allows a network management application to distribute
   and manage scripts to remote devices.  Conceivably, these scripts
   could be designed to run a set of active probe monitors on remote
   devices.

5.3 RMON

   The RMON working group has developed a extensive, passive monitoring
   capability defined in RFC 2819 [RFC2819] and RFC 2021 [RFC2021] as
   well as additional MIB modules.  Initially, the monitors collected
   statistics at the MAC layer, but has now been extended to high-layer
   statistics.  Higher-layer statistics are identified through the
   definition of a Protocol Directory [RFC2021].  See the RMONMIB
   framework document [RFC3577] for an overview of the RMONMIB
   capabilities.



C. Kalbfleisch              Expires July 2004                   [Page 5]





INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


   Within this context, the development of an active traffic source for
   performance monitoring fits well within the overall performance
   monitoring architecture being defined within the RMON WG.

5.4 ApplMIB

   The ApplMIB working group defined a series of MIB modules which
   monitor various aspects of applications, processes and services.

   The System Application MIB [RFC2287] describes a basic set of managed
   objects for fault, configuration and performance management of
   applications from a systems perspective.  More specifically, the
   managed objects it defines are restricted to information that can be
   determined from the system itself and which does not require special
   instrumentation within the applications to make the information
   available.

   The Application MIB [RFC2564] complements the System Application MIB,
   providing for the management of applications' common attributes which
   could not typically be observed without the cooperation of the
   software being managed. There are attributes which provide
   information on application and communication performance.

   The WWW MIB [RFC2594] describes a set of objects for managing
   networked services in the Internet Community, particularly World Wide
   Web (WWW) services. Performance attributes are available for the
   information about each WWW service, each type of request, each type
   of response and top accessed documents.

   In the development of synthetic application-level probes,
   consideration should be given to the relationship of the application
   MIB modules to the measurements being performed through a synthetic
   application-level probe.  Similar, cross-indexing issues arise within
   the context of the RMON monitoring and synthetic application-level
   active probes.

5.5 SNMPCONF

   The SNMPCONF working group has created an informational RFC 3512
   [RFC3512] which outlines the most effective methods for using the
   SNMP Framework to accomplish configuration management.  This work
   includes recommendations for device specific as well as network-wide
   (Policy) configuration.  The group is also chartered to write any MIB
   modules necessary to facilitate configuration management,
   specifically they will write a MIB module which describes a network
   entities capabilities and capacities which can be used by management
   entities making policy decisions at a network level or device
   specific level.

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


   Currently the SNMPCONF working group is focused on the SNMP
   Configuration MIB for policy [PMM].  It is conceivable that one would
   want to monitor the performance of newly configured policies as they
   are implemented within networks.  This would require correlation of
   the implemented policy and a related performance monitoring policy,
   which would specify synthetic probe definitions.  For synthetic
   probes there would be a need to have configuration of a) a single
   probe, b) several probes, c) source and destination probes and d)
   intermediate probes.  In addition, it may be necessary to configure
   any or all of these combinations simultaneously.  It is hoped that
   the work of SNMPCONF will suffice.  The scripting language defined by
   the SNMP Configuration MIB could allow for active monitoring to be
   activated and configured from a policy management script.  Further,
   the results of active monitoring could become arguments in further
   policy decisions.  This notion is reflected in the decision flow
   outlined in Figure 1 below.

5.6 RTFM

   The Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) working group is
   concerned with issues relating to traffic flow measurements, usage
   reporting for network traffic and Internet accounting.  Various
   documents exist which describe requirements [RFC1272], traffic flow
   measurement architectures [RFC2722], and a traffic flow MIB
   [RFC2720].  The work in this group is focused on passive measurements
   of user traffic.  As such, its work is related to the monitoring work
   within the RMON WG.  Fundamentally, their attention has not been
   concerned with methods of active traffic generation.

5.7 Relationship to Other Work: Summary

   In summary, the development of an active traffic generation
   capability primarily for the purpose of performance monitoring should
   draw upon various activities, both past and present within the IETF.
   Figure 1 shows the relationship of the various work activities
   briefly touched upon in this section.

   Horizontally, across the top of the figure are overall control
   functions, which would coordinate the various aspects of the
   performance monitoring systems.  Vertically at the bottom of the
   figure are the functions which comprise the minimum performance
   monitoring capability, i.e., traffic generation, monitoring and
   measurements, and data reduction.  Traffic generation is address in
   this MIB module.  Monitoring and measurement is address in the APM-
   MIB [RFCXXX1] and the TPM-MIB [RFCXXX2] modules.  Data reduction is
   not yet addressed within the IETF.  But data reduction could include
   both spatial and temporal aggregations and at different levels of
   reduction.  This is indicated in the figure by the arrow labeled
   "Various levels and span".

6. MIB Structure

   This section presents the structure of the MIB module. The objects
   are arranged into the following groups:

      o general information

      o source configuration

      o sink configuration

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


6.1.  General Information
   This section provides general information about the capabilities of
   the probe. Currently this information is related to the resolution of
   the probe clock and its source.

6.2.  Source Configuration
   The source is configured with a pair of tables. The first,
   sspmSourceProfileTable, defines a set of profiles for monitoring.
   These profiles are then used by the second table,
   sspmSourceControlTable, to instantiate a specific measurement.  This
   MIB module takes an IP centric view of the configuration of the
   measurement.

6.3.  Sink Configuration
   Configures the sink for measurements. If the test is round-trip then
   this table is on the same probe as the source configuration. If the
   test is one-way then the table is on a different probe. The
   sspmSinkInstance is a unique identifier for the entry per probe.
   Additional attributes are provided for test type and source of the
   test to uniquely identifier entries in the table.

11.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects to allow packets to be injected into
   the network for the purpose of measuring some performance
   characteristics. As such, the MIB module may contain sensitive
   network and application data, e.g., user IDs and passwords.  Further,
   if security is compromised, this MIB module could provide a source
   for denial-of-service, and potential other, attacks.  These issues
   will be addressed within this section.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      + The sspmSourceProfileTable contains objects that configure link-
      level, IP and application level data used within test suites.
      These objects with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
      create are:

         o sspmSourcePacketSize - configures the overall size of the
         test packets,

         o sspmSourceProfileTOS - sets the TOS field in the IPv4 and
         IPv6 headers,

         o sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteFill and
         sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteLen - gives a list of IPv4 or IPv6
         addresses for the loose source route options in the IP headers,

         o sspmSourceProfileFlowLabel - sets the Flow Label in the IPv6
         header,




C. Kalbfleisch              Expires July 2004                  [Page 28]





INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


         o sspmSourceProfileTTL - sets the TTL field in the packet
         headers,

         o sspmSourceProfileNoFrag - sets the No Fragment bit in the
         packet headers,

         o sspmSourceProfile8021Tagging - sets the Tag field in the
         802.1 headers, and

         o sspmSourceProfileUsername and sspmSourceProfilePassowrd -
         these hold the ID and passwords specific to an application test
         profile.,

      + The sspmSourceControlTable contains objects that configure IP
      and application level data used within a given test.  These
      objects with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create
      are:

         o sspmSourceControlSrc - controls the source IP address used on
         the test packets,

         o sspmSourceControlDestAddr - holds the destination address for
         the specific test packet,

         o sspmSourceControlTimeout, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist and
         sspmSourceControlFrequency - control the nature and frequency
         of the test packet injection onto the network, and

         o sspmSourceControlFirstSeqNum and sspmSourceControlLastSeqNum
         - sets the first and last sequence numbers for the specific
         test.

      + The sspmSinkTable contains objects that configure the recipient
      of the test packets.  As such, the objects in this table have no
      security issues related to them.

   There are some attributes which configure username and password
   information for some application level protocols as indicated above.
   Access to these attributes may provide unauthorized use of resources.
   These attributes are: sspmSourceProfileUsername and
   sspmSourceProfilePassword.

   There are some attributes which configure the size and rate of
   traffic flows for the purpose of performance measurements.  Access to
   these attributes may exacerbate the use of this MIB module in denial-
   of-service attacks.  It is possible to define a maximum packet rate
   on the device and indicate this maximum rate through the
   sspmSourceFrequency object.  This object reflects the maximum



C. Kalbfleisch              Expires July 2004                  [Page 29]





INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                    January 2004


   acceptable packet rate that a device supporting this MIB module is
   willing to generate.  This places a bound on setting the test packet
   rate through the sspmSourceControlFrequency object.  Other objects
   which control aspects of the test packets related to packet size and
   rate are the sspmSourceControlTimeOut, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist
   and sspmSourceControlFrequency.

   The objects sspmSourceControlSrc, sspmSourceControlDestAddr,
   sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteFill and sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteLen
   control the setting of the source and destination addresses on the
   packet headers and the routing of the packets.  The device should not
   allow the setting of source addresses on the test packets other than
   those which are administratively configured onto the device.  This is
   controlled by using the syntax InterfaceIndexOrZero for the control
   of the source address through the sspmSourceControlSrc object.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
