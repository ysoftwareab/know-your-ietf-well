Abstract 
    
   This document defines a new security precondition for the Session 
   Description Protocol (SDP) precondition framework described in RFCs 
   3312 and 4032.  A security precondition can be used to delay session 
   establishment or modification until media stream security for a 
   secure media stream has been negotiated successfully.

2  Introduction 
    
   The concept of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) [SDP] 
   precondition is defined in [RFC3312] as updated by [RFC4032].  A 
   precondition is a condition that has to be satisfied for a given 
   media stream in order for session establishment or modification to 
   proceed.  When a (mandatory) precondition is not met, session 
   progress is delayed until the precondition is satisfied or the 
   session establishment fails.  For example, RFC 3312 defines the 
   Quality of Service precondition, which is used to ensure 
   availability of network resources prior to establishing (i.e. 
   alerting) a call.   
    
   Media streams can either be provided in cleartext and with no 
   integrity protection, or some kind of media security can be applied, 
   e.g., confidentiality and/or message integrity.  For example, the 
   Audio/Video profile of the Real-Time Transfer protocol (RTP) 
   [RFC3551] is normally used without any security services whereas the 
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [SRTP] is always used 
   with security services.  When media stream security is being 
   negotiated, e.g., using the mechanism defined in SDP Security 
   Descriptions [SDESC], both the offerer and the answerer [OFFANS] 
   need to know the cryptographic parameters being used for the media 
   stream; the offerer may provide multiple choices for the 
   cryptographic parameters, or the cryptographic parameters selected 
   by the answerer may differ from those of the offerer (e.g. the key 
   used in one direction versus the other).  In such cases, to avoid 
   media clipping, the offerer needs to receive the answer prior to 
   receiving any media packets from the answerer.  This can be achieved

   by using a security precondition, which ensures the successful 
   negotiation of media stream security parameters for a secure media 
   stream prior to session establishment or modification.   
    
3  Security Precondition Definition  
    
   The semantics for a security precondition are that the relevant 
   cryptographic parameters (cipher, key, etc.) for a secure media 
   stream are known to have been negotiated in the direction(s) 
   required.  If the security precondition is used with a non-secure 
   media stream, the security precondition is by definition satisfied.  
   A secure media stream is here defined as a media stream that uses 
   some kind of security service, e.g. message integrity, 
   confidentiality or both, regardless of the cryptographic strength of 
   the mechanisms being used.   
    
     As an extreme example of this, Secure RTP (SRTP) using the NULL 
     encryption algorithm and no message integrity would be considered 
     a secure media stream whereas use of plain RTP would not.  Note 
     though, that section 9.5 of [SRTP] discourages the use of SRTP 
     without message integrity.  
    
   Security preconditions do not guarantee that an established media 
   stream will be secure.  They merely guarantee that the recipient of 
   the media stream packets will be able to perform any relevant 
   decryption and integrity checking on those media stream packets. 
   Please refer to Section 5 for further security considerations.   
    
   The security precondition type is defined by the string "sec" and 
   hence we modify the grammar found in RFC 3312 as follows: 
    
     precondition-type  =  "sec" | "qos" | token 
    
   RFC 3312 defines support for two kinds of status types, namely 
   segmented and end-to-end.  The security precondition-type defined 
   here MUST be used with the end-to-end status type; use of the 
   segmented status type is undefined.  
    
   A security preconditions can use the strength-tag "mandatory", 
   "optional" or "none".  
    
   When a security precondition with a strength-tag of "mandatory" is 
   received in an offer, session establishment or modification MUST be 
   delayed until the security precondition has been met, i.e. the 
   relevant cryptographic parameters (cipher, key, etc.) for a secure 
   media stream are known to have been negotiated in the direction(s) 
   required.  When a mandatory security precondition is offered, and 
   the answerer cannot satisfy the security precondition, e.g. because 
   the offer was for a secure media stream, but it did not include the 
   necessary parameters to establish the secure media stream (keying

   material for example), the offered media stream MUST be rejected as 
   described in RFC 3312.   
      
   The delay of session establishment defined here implies that 
   alerting of the called party MUST NOT occur and media for which 
   security is being negotiated MUST NOT be exchanged until the 
   precondition has been satisfied.  In cases where secure media and 
   other non-secure data is multiplexed on a media stream, e.g. when 
   Interactive Connectivity Establishment [ICE] is being used, the non-
   secure data is allowed to be exchanged prior to the security 
   precondition being satisfied.   
    
   When a security precondition with a strength-tag of "optional" is 
   received in an offer, the answerer MUST generate its answer SDP as 
   soon as possible.  Since session progress is not delayed in this 
   case, the answerer does not know when the offerer is able to process 
   secure media stream packets and hence clipping may occur.  If the 
   answerer wants to avoid clipping and delay session progress until he 
   knows the offerer has received the answer, the answerer MUST 
   increase the strength of the security precondition by using a 
   strength-tag of "mandatory" in the answer.  Note that use of a 
   mandatory precondition requires the presence of a SIP "Require" 
   header field containing the option tag "precondition": Any SIP UA 
   that does not support a mandatory precondition will consequently 
   reject such requests (which also has unintended ramifications for 
   SIP forking that are known as the Heterogeneous Error Response 
   Forking Problem (see e.g. [HERFP]).  To get around this, an optional 
   security precondition and the SIP "Supported" header field 
   containing the option tag "precondition" can be used instead.  
    
   When a security precondition with a strength-tag of "none" is 
   received, processing continues us usual.  The "none" strength-tag 
   merely indicates that the offerer supports the security precondition 
   - the answerer MAY upgrade the strength-tag in the answer as 
   described in [RFC3312].  
    
   The direction tags defined in RFC 3312 are interpreted as follows: 
    
   * send:  Media stream security negotiation is at a stage where it is 
     possible to send media packets to the other party and the other 
     party will be able to process them correctly from a security point 
     of view, i.e. decrypt and/or integrity check them as necessary.  
     The definition of "media packets" includes all packets that make 
     up the media stream.  In the case of Secure RTP for example, it 
     includes SRTP as well as SRTCP.  When media and non-media packets 
     are multiplexed on a given media stream, e.g. when ICE is being 
     used, the requirement applies to the media packets only.  
    
   * recv:  Media stream security negotiation is at a stage where it is 
     possible to receive and correctly process media stream packets

     sent by the other party from a security point of view.   
      
   The precise criteria for determining when the other party is able to 
   correctly process media stream packets from a security point of view 
   depend on the secure media stream protocol being used as well as the 
   mechanism by which the required cryptographic parameters are 
   negotiated.   
    
   We here provide details for SRTP negotiated through SDP security 
   descriptions as defined in [SDESC]: 
    
   * When the offerer requests the "send" security precondition, it 
     needs to receive the answer before the security precondition is 
     satisfied.  The reason for this is twofold.  First, the offerer 
     needs to know where to send the media to.  Secondly, in the case 
     where alternative cryptographic parameters are offered, the 
     offerer needs to know which set was selected.  The answerer does 
     not know when the answer is actually received by the offerer 
     (which in turn will satisfy the precondition), and hence the 
     answerer needs to use the confirm-status attribute [RFC3312].  
     This will make the offerer generate a new offer showing the 
     updated status of the precondition.  
    
   * When the offerer requests the "recv" security precondition, it 
     also needs to receive the answer before the security precondition 
     is satisfied.  The reason for this is straightforward: The answer 
     contains the cryptographic parameters that will be used by the 
     answerer for sending media to the offerer; prior to receipt of 
     these cryptographic parameters the offerer is unable to 
     authenticate or decrypt such media.  
    
   When security preconditions are used with the Key Management 
   Extensions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) [KMGMT], the 
   details depend on the actual key management protocol being used.   
    
   After an initial offer/answer exchange in which the security 
   precondition is requested, any subsequent offer/answer sequence for 
   the purpose of updating the status of the precondition for a secure 
   media stream SHOULD use the same key material as the initial 
   offer/answer exchange.  This means that the key-mgmt attribute lines 
   [KMGMT] or crypto attribute lines [SDESC] in SDP offers, that are 
   sent in response to SDP answers containing a confirm-status field 
   [RFC3312], SHOULD repeat the same data as that sent in the previous 
   SDP offer.  If applicable to the key management protocol or SDP 
   security description, the SDP answers to these SDP offers SHOULD 
   repeat the same data in the key-mgmt attribute lines [KMGMT] or 
   crypto attribute lines [SDESC] as that sent in the previous SDP 
   answer.  
    
   Of course, this duplication of key exchange during precondition 
   establishment is not to be interpreted as a replay attack.  This

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2006 
 
 
   issue may be solved if, e.g., the SDP implementation recognizes that 
   the key management protocol data is identical in the second 
   offer/answer exchange and avoids forwarding the information to the 
   security layer for further processing.  
    
   Offers with security preconditions in re-INVITEs or UPDATEs follow 
   the rules given in Section 6 of RFC 3312, i.e.: 
    
     "Both user agents SHOULD continue using the old session parameters  
     until all the mandatory preconditions are met.  At that moment,      
     the user agents can begin using the new session parameters." 
    
   At that moment, we furthermore require that ser agents MUST start 
   using the new session parameters for media packets being sent. The 
   user agents SHOULD be prepared to process media packets received 
   with either the old or the new session parameters for a short period 
   of time to accommodate media packets in transit. Note that this may 
   involve iterative security processing of the received media packets 
   during that period of time.  Section 8 in [OFFANS] lists several 
   techniques to help alleviate the problem of determining when a 
   received media packet was generated according to the old or new 
   offer/answer exchange.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2006 
 
 
   The SDP descriptions of this example are shown below - we have 
   omitted the details of the SDP security descriptions as well as any 
   SIP details for clarity of the security precondition described here: 
    
    
   SDP1: A includes a mandatory end-to-end security precondition for 
   both the send and receive direction in the initial offer as well as 
   a "crypto" attribute (see [SDESC]), which includes keying material 
   that can be used by A to generate media packets.  Since B does not 
   know any of the security parameters yet, the current status (see RFC 
   3312) is set to "none".  A's local status table (see RFC 3312) for 
   the security precondition is as follows: 
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
    
   and the resulting offer SDP is: 
    
     m=audio 20000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=curr:sec e2e none 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=crypto:foo... 
    
   SDP2: When B receives the offer and generates an answer, B knows the 
   (send and recv) security parameters of both A and B.  From a 
   security perspective, B is now able to receive media from A, so  B's 
   "recv" security precondition is "yes".  However, A does not know any 
   of B's SDP information, so B's "send" security precondition is "no".  
   B's local status table therefore looks as follows:  
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 
    
    
   B requests A to confirm when A knows the security parameters used in 
   the send and receive direction (it would suffice for B to ask for 
   confirmation of A's send direction only) and hence the resulting 
   answer SDP becomes:  
    
     m=audio 30000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:sec e2e recv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=conf:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=crypto:bar... 
    
 
 
 
Andreasen, Wing                                               [Page 7] 

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2006 
 
 
   SDP3: When A receives the answer, A updates its local status table 
   based on the rules in RFC 3312.  A knows the security parameters of 
   both the send and receive direction and hence A's local status table 
   is updated as follows: 
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    yes 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    yes 
    
    
   Since B requested confirmation of the send and recv security 
   preconditions, and both are now satisfied, A immediately sends an 
   updated offer (3) to B showing that the security preconditions are 
   satisfied: 
    
     m=audio 20000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=curr:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=crypto:foo... 
    
   Note that we here use PRACK [RFC3262] instead of UPDATE [RFC3311] 
   since the precondition is satisfied immediately, and the original 
   offer/answer exchange is complete. 
    
   SDP4:  Upon receiving the updated offer, B updates its local status 
   table based on the rules in RFC 3312 which yields the following: 
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 
    
   B responds with an answer (4) which contains the current status of 
   the security precondition (i.e., sendrecv) from B's point of view: 
    
     m=audio 30000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=crypto:bar... 
    
   B's local status table indicates that all mandatory preconditions 
   have been satisfied, and hence session establishment resumes; B 
   returns a 180 (Ringing) response (5) to indicate alerting.

                Figure 2: Security Preconditions with Key Management  
                          Extensions for SDP Example 
    
   The SDP descriptions of this example are shown below - we show an 
   example use of MIKEY [MIKEY] with the Key Management Extensions, 
   however we have omitted the details of the MIKEY parameters as well 
   as any SIP details for clarity of the security precondition 
   described here: 
    
   SDP1: A includes a mandatory end-to-end security precondition for 
   both the send and receive direction in the initial offer as well as 
   a "key-mgmt" attribute (see [KMGMT]), which includes keying material 
   that can be used by A to generate media packets.  Since B does not 
   know any of the security parameters yet, the current status (see RFC 
   3312) is set to "none".  A's local status table (see RFC 3312) for 
   the security precondition is as follows: 
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
    
   and the resulting offer SDP is: 
    
     m=audio 20000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=curr:sec e2e none 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=key-mgmt:mikey AQAFgM0X...

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2006 
 
 
   SDP2: When B receives the offer and generates an answer, B knows the 
   (send and recv) security parameters of both A and B.  B generates 
   keying material for sending media to A, however, A does not know B's 
   keying material, so the current status of B's "send" security 
   precondition  is "no".  B does know A's SDP information, so B's 
   "recv" security precondition is "yes".  B's local status table 
   therefore looks as follows:  
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 
    
    
   B requests A to confirm when A knows the security parameters used in 
   the send and receive direction and hence the resulting answer SDP 
   becomes:  
    
     m=audio 30000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:sec e2e recv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=conf:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=key-mgmt:mikey AQAFgM0X... 
    
   Note that the actual MIKEY data in the answer differs from that in 
   the offer, however we have only shown the initial and common part of 
   the MIKEY value in the above. 
    
   SDP3: When A receives the answer, A updates its local status table 
   based on the rules in RFC 3312.  A now knows all the security 
   parameters of both the send and receive direction and hence A's 
   local status table is updated as follows: 
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    yes 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    yes 
    
    
   Since B requested confirmation of the send and recv security 
   preconditions, and both are now satisfied, A immediately sends an 
   updated offer (3) to B showing that the security preconditions are 
   satisfied: 
    
     m=audio 20000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=curr:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=key-mgmt:mikey AQAFgM0X...

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2006 
 
 
   SDP4:  Upon receiving the updated offer, B updates its local status 
   table based on the rules in RFC 3312 which yields the following: 
    
       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 
    
   B responds with an answer (4) which contains the current status of 
   the security precondition (i.e., sendrecv) from B's point of view: 
    
     m=audio 30000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=key-mgmt:mikey AQAFgM0X... 
    
   B's local status table indicates that all mandatory preconditions 
   have been satisfied, and hence session establishment resumes; B 
   returns a 180 (Ringing) response (5) to indicate alerting.  
    
5  Security Considerations 
    
   In addition to the general security considerations for preconditions 
   provided in RFC 3312, the following security issues should be 
   considered.  
    
   Security preconditions delay session establishment until 
   cryptographic parameters required to send and/or receive media for a 
   media stream have been negotiated.  Negotiation of such parameters 
   can fail for a variety of reasons, including policy preventing use 
   of certain cryptographic algorithms, keys, and other security 
   parameters.  If an attacker can remove security preconditions or 
   downgrade the strength-tag from an offer/answer exchange, the 
   attacker can thereby cause user alerting for a session that may have 
   no functioning media.  This is likely to cause inconvenience to both 
   the offerer and the answerer.  Similarly, security preconditions can 
   be used to prevent clipping due to race conditions between an 
   offer/answer exchange and secure media stream packets based on that 
   offer/answer exchange.  If an attacker can remove or downgrade the 
   strength-tag of security preconditions from an offer/answer 
   exchange, the attacker can cause clipping to occur in the associated 
   secure media stream.   
    
   Conversely, an attacker might add security preconditions to offers 
   that do not contain them or increase their strength-tag.  This in 
   turn may lead to session failure (e.g. if the answerer does not 
   support it), heterogeneous error response forking problems, or a 
   delay in session establishment that was not desired.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2006 
 
 
   Use of signaling integrity mechanisms can prevent all of the above 
   problems.  Where intermediaries on the signaling path (e.g. SIP 
   proxies) are trusted, it is sufficient to use only hop-by-hop 
   integrity protection of signaling, e.g., IPSec or TLS.  In all other 
   cases, end-to-end integrity protection of signaling, e.g. S/MIME, 
   MUST be used.  Note that the end-to-end integrity protection MUST 
   cover not only the message body, which contains the security 
   preconditions, but also the SIP "Supported" and "Require" headers, 
   which may contain the "precondition" option tag.  If only the 
   message body were integrity protected, removal of the "precondition" 
   option tag could lead to clipping (when a security precondition was 
   otherwise to be used), whereas addition of the option tag could lead 
   to session failure (if the other side does not support 
   preconditions).  
    
   As specified in Section 3, security preconditions do not guarantee 
   that an established media stream will be secure.  They merely 
   guarantee that the recipient of the media stream packets will be 
   able to perform any relevant decryption and integrity checking on 
   those media stream packets.  If an offer includes a secure and a 
   non-secure media stream as alternatives, this may lead to additional 
   security issues.  It is important to understand how security 
   preconditions interact with those.  
      
     SDP and the offer/answer model currently do not define how such 
     alternatives could be negotiated, however there is work in 
     progress to address that (see e.g. [SDPCN]).  Negotiating secure 
     and non-secure media streams as alternatives however introduces 
     several security issues and hence SHOULD NOT be done until a 
     complete specification for doing so has been documented in detail 
     and reviewed properly.  Below, we provide general security 
     considerations for security preconditions that may aid in the 
     design and review of such mechanisms.  
    
   Note that a basic premise of negotiating secure and non-secure media 
   streams as alternatives is that the offerer's security policy allows 
   for non-secure media.  If the offer were to include secure and non-
   secure media streams as alternative offers, and media for either 
   alternative may be received prior to the answer, then the offerer 
   may not know if the answerer accepted the secure alternative.  An 
   active attacker thus may be able to inject malicious media stream 
   packets until the answer (indicating the chosen secure alternative) 
   is received.  Use of security preconditions (even with a mandatory 
   strength-tag) would not address this vulnerability since security 
   preconditions would apply only to the secure media stream 
   alternatives.

6  IANA Considerations  
    
   IANA is hereby requested to register a RFC 3312 precondition type 
   called "sec" with the name "Security precondition".  The reference 
   for this precondition type is the current document.  
    
7  Acknowledgements 
    
   The security precondition was defined in earlier draft versions of 
   RFC 3312.  RFC 3312 contains an extensive list of people who worked 
   on those earlier draft versions which are acknowledged here as well.  
   The authors would additionally like to thank David Black, Mark 
   Baugher, Gonzalo Camarillo, Paul Kyzivat and Thomas Stach for their 
   comments on this document.
