1.  Introduction

   In [Curve25519], a new elliptic curve function for use in
   cryptographic applications was introduced.  In [Ed448-Goldilocks] the
   Ed448-Goldilocks curve (also known as Curve448) is described.  In
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves], the Diffie-Hellman functions using Curve25519
   and Curve448 are specified.

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a secure remote login protocol.  The
   key exchange protocol described in [RFC4253] supports an extensible
   set of methods.  [RFC5656] describes how elliptic curves are
   integrated in SSH, and this document reuses those protocol messages.

   This document describes how to implement key exchange based on
   Curve25519 and Curve448 in SSH.  For Curve25519, the algorithm we
   describe is equivalent to the privately defined algorithm
   "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org", which is currently implemented and
   widely deployed in libssh and OpenSSH.  The Curve448 key exchange
   method is novel but similar in spirit.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Key Exchange Methods

   The key exchange procedure is similar to the ECDH method described in
   chapter 4 of [RFC5656], though with a different wire encoding used
   for public values and the final shared secret.  Public ephemeral keys
   are encoded for transmission as standard SSH strings.

   The protocol flow, the SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT and
   SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY messages, and the structure of the exchange
   hash are identical to chapter 4 of [RFC5656].

Internet-Draft           Curve25519/448 for SSH            November 2015


   The method names registered by this document are "curve25519-sha256"
   and "curve448-sha256".

   The methods are based on Curve25519 and Curve448 scalar
   multiplication, as described in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].  Private and
   public keys are generated as described therein.  Public keys are
   defined as strings of 32 bytes for Curve25519 and 56 bytes for
   Curve448.  Clients and servers MUST verify the length of the received
   public keys, but no further validation is required beyond what is
   discussed in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].  The derived shared secret is 32
   bytes when Curve25519 is used and 56 bytes when Curve448 is used.
   The encodings of all values are defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].

2.1.  Shared Secret Encoding

   The following step differs from [RFC5656], which uses a different
   conversion.  This is not intended to modify that text generally, but
   only to be applicable to the scope of this document.

   The shared secret, K, is defined in [RFC4253] as a multiple precision
   integer (mpint).  Curve25519/448 outputs a binary string X, which is
   the 32 or 56 byte point obtained by scalar multiplication of the
   other side's public key and the local private key scalar.  The 32 or
   56 bytes of X are converted into K by interpreting the bytes as an
   unsigned fixed-length integer encoded in network byte order.

   When K is encoded as mpint in order to calculate the exchange hash,
   its encoding will often be identical to X, but will vary as follows:

   o  If the high bit of X is set, the mpint format requires a zero byte
      to be prepended.  In this case, encoded K is larger than encoded
      X.

   o  If X has leading zero bytes, the mpint format requires such bytes
      to be skipped.  In this case, encoded K is smaller than encoded X.

3.  Acknowledgements

   The "curve25519-sha256" key exchange method is identical to the
   "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org" key exchange method created by Aris
   Adamantiadis and implemented in libssh and OpenSSH.

   Thanks to the following people for review and comments: Denis Bider,
   Damien Miller, Niels Moeller, Matt Johnston.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4251], [RFC5656], and
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves] are inherited.

   The way the derived binary secret string is encoded into a mpint
   before it is hashed (i.e., adding or removing zero-bytes for
   encoding) raises the potential for a side-channel attack which could
   determine the length of what is hashed.  This would leak the most
   significant bit of the derived secret, and/or allow detection of when
   the most significant bytes are zero.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add "curve25519-sha256" and "curve448-sha256" to
   the "Key Exchange Method Names" registry for SSH that was created in
   RFC 4250 section 4.10 [RFC4250].
