Abstract

   Call Park and Call Retrieve are useful telephony services that are
   familiar to many users.  Existing implementations using the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) show that a variety of approaches can be
   taken, with varying degrees of interoperability.  This draft
   discusses a number of feature variations, and how they may be
   implemented.

Internet-Draft              SIP Park/Retrieve              February 2008


1.  Overview

   Call Park is a feature that enables UAs to make a call inactive but
   not terminated, in such a way as to allow the call to be resumed by
   the UA that parked the call, or by a different UA.

   This feature is typically used when User A wishes to transfer a call
   in progress to User B, but doesn't necessarily know how to reach User
   B's UA directly.  In this situation, User A parks the call, and then
   tells User B where the call is parked.  User B may then retrieve the
   call using a convenient UA.

   Other uses include allowing multiple calls to be parked at the same
   'location', and forming a queue.  In this way, a simple 'ACD' system
   can be implemented that permits calls to be initially sorted and
   placed in one of a number of queues, ready to be handled when an
   appropriate agent becomes available (and retrieves the next call from
   the queue).

   In all cases, the parked call is subsequently identifiable by a short
   (typically 3 or 4 digit) label known as an 'orbit'.  This orbit is
   often allocated by the user parking the call, but some environments
   favour allocation of the orbit by a Park Server.  Both approaches are
   described in this document.

   Having a Park Server for parked calls is a useful approach, which
   secures parked calls against User Agent rebooting and other losses of
   service.  However, being able to park and retrieve calls without a
   Park Server is also a useful model, both in terms of decentralised
   network design and also for smaller installations that don't
   necessarily merit a separate Park Server.  Therefore, parking with
   and without a Park Server are discussed in this document.


2.  Parking a call

   A basic call flow for Call Park is given in [1] (section 2.15), and
   this forms the basis of the feature.  This approach uses the SIP
   dialog ID between the parked endpoint and the park server itself as
   the unique parked call identifier.  Using the dialog ID has a number
   of advantages since it is unique and allocated by both the parked
   user and the Park Server.  However, it is also long, which can lead
   to problems when trying to identify parked calls by verbal or human-
   written mechanisms.

   Traditional PBX users have become accustomed to parking a call
   against a short number (typically 3 or 4 digits), and then using this
   identifier to communicate to the retrieving party which call to

   retrieve.  This information may be passed verbally, or by means of
   small paper notes.  Whilst collisions may occur, they are generally
   avoided satisfactorily by administrative policies.

   This draft attempts to reconcile these two models by allowing a short
   label to be attached to a parked call (the 'orbit').  The retrieving
   party can then use the same tag to locate the relevant dialog ID in
   order to retrieve the parked call.

2.1.  Parking a call without an orbit

   Certain environments do not require an 'orbit' to be used, either
   because calls are parked in a single queue, or the dialog identifiers
   are readily passed between concerned UAs.  In this scenario, the flow
   described in [1] is followed without deviation.

2.2.  Parking a call with a specified orbit

   The message flow of parking a call in this scenario is identical to
   that illustrated in [1].  The difference that this draft introduces
   is in the REFER message to the Park Server.  The details of the REFER
   message changes are discussed below.

   The URI <sips:park-server@example.com;orbit=1234> is used instead of
   directing the request to the URI <sips:park@server.example.com>.  The
   addition of the orbit parameter effectively tags the parked call with
   a short memorable code entered by the user.

2.3.  Parking a call with a Park-Server allocated orbit

   Sometimes an orbit number assignment policy needs to be implemented.
   This may be to ensure that all orbit numbers are a particular length,
   or have a form that means that they can be dialled directly (given
   suitable extensions to an Application Server).  It may also be
   implemented to eliminate the problem of trying to park more than one
   call on the same orbit.

   To enforce a policy, we ensure that the orbit number is not allocated
   by the UA (entered by the user, or by configuration etc.) but is
   instead allocated by the Park Server, and relayed to the UA.  The
   approach taken here is analogous to the Conference Factory approach
   described in [3].  Bob sends a REFER to the preconfigured Park Server
   URI, but without any 'orbit' parameter added.  The Park Server then
   responds by redirecting Bob to the correct orbit by using a '302
   Moved Temporarily' response.  The orbit can then be found by
   inspecting this new target.  Note that an intermediate proxy may
   recurse on this 302 response and Bob may never see the redirect.  In
   this scenario, Bob can still extract the orbit from Contact of 2xx
   response to the original REFER.

   Once Bob's UA learns of the allocated orbit (either by finding it in
   the 302 response, or by finding it in the Contact of the 202 response
   to the REFER), it can be passed to the user (Bob) in an appropriate
   manner.

2.4.  A failed attempt to park a call

   A Park Server may choose to reject a park attempt for many reasons,
   including prohibiting multiple calls being parked against the same
   orbit, or prohibiting certain users from parking calls on certain
   orbits.  Whatever the reason, the response sent to Bob will enable
   Bob to take appropriate action.  The following example shows the Park
   Server rejecting a call due to the orbit already being in use.

   When Bob's parking attempt is rejected, Bob may choose to attempt to
   park the call again, but using a different orbit number.  The ability
   for Bob to recover from failed parking attempts such as this without
   dropping the call to Alice is an important consequence of Bob sending
   the REFER to the Park Server, rather than sending the REFER to Alice
   so that she can park herself.

2.5.  Parking a call without a Park Server

   Sometimes, it is useful to be able to park a call without using a
   Park Server.  The original dialog between Alice and Bob is
   maintained, even though Bob has notionally parked the call.  As a
   consequence, the only changes that occur may be within Bob's UA, and
   will not necessarily involve any SIP signalling.


3.  Retrieving a Parked Call

   In order to retrieve a parked call, Carol needs to obtain the dialog
   identifiers for the dialog between Alice and wherever Alice is
   parked.

   The dialog identifiers can be obtained by issuing a SUBSCRIBE for the
   dialog event package [2].  The resulting NOTIFY will contain details
   of all pertinent calls, including the dialog identifiers.  Carol may
   (if presented with multiple dialogs) choose which call to retrieve.
   Many implementations choose the first dialog listed, although some
   use the <duration> element to identify which call has been parked for
   the longest time.

Internet-Draft              SIP Park/Retrieve              February 2008


   Once Carol has the necessary dialog identifiers, she can retrieve the
   parked call using the flow descibed in [1].

3.1.  Retrieving a call from a Park Server

   By subscribing to the dialog event package [2] at the same URI used
   for parking the call, i.e. <sips:park-server@example.com;orbit=1234>,
   all the information that is required for the call to be retrieved by
   C is delivered in the corresponding NOTIFY.

   Similarly, if the call was parked in an environment that does not
   require 'orbit' parameters, subscribing to the URI used for parking
   the call, i.e. <sips:park-server@example.com>, will still result in
   the necessary information being provided for the call to be
   retrieved.

   The remainder of the frames are the same as the corresponding frames

   SUBSCRIBE / NOTIFY cycle from the Park Server.

3.2.  Retrieving a call from a User Agent

   Retrieving a parked call from a User Agent is very similar to
   retrieving a call from a Park Server.  The main difference is
   identifying which URI should be used for the initial subscription, in



Procter                  Expires August 24, 2008               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              SIP Park/Retrieve              February 2008


   order to find the dialog identifiers for the parked call.

   The URI most likely to be known for a particular User Agent is the
   AoR.  But this may correspond to multiple UAs.  Therefore, if Carol
   subscribes to the AoR, she should be prepared for multple NOTIFY
   responses, should her SUBSCRIBE fork.

   It is tempting to state that Carol should subscribe to the GRUU of
   the UA with the parked call.  This will work well if the GRUU is
   known in advance (possibly by Carol having a long-lived subscription
   to Bob's UA).  If the GRUU is not known in advance, then it may prove
   too onerous to expect it to be typed in on Carol's UA, just to
   retrieve a parked call.

   Open issue: Is subscribing to the AoR the best we can offer?

   Using the 'orbit' parameter in conjunction with parking calls on User
   Agents can lead to difficulties in ensuring that the 'orbit'
   parameter is delivered to the User Agent.  See [4] and [5] for the
   currently debated approaches.

   Open issue: I think either approach will serve our purposes here.
   Presumably we can just wait and see which one is favoured.

   If the 'orbit' parameter is not used, then Carol will eventually find
   out about all the dialogs currently in progress at Bob's UA.
   Distinguishing the parked call from other dialogs may prove
   challenging (assuming that all calls marked as held is not
   acceptable).  There may be an opportunity to reuse some BLISS-MLA
   work here, which permits dialogs to be marked as 'exclusive', which
   indicates that other UAs should not attempt to pick them up.

   Open issue: How should a parked call be identified when parked on a
   UA with other (potentially non-parked) dialogs in progress?  Does
   this problem only exist when an orbit is not used?


4.  User Agent Configuration

   For Bob and Carol to be able to park and retrieve calls using a Park
   Server, both need to be configured with the URI of the Park Server.
   In addition, Bob and Carol should be configured to understand whether
   or not an orbit will be required for park and retrieve.  Finally, Bob
   also needs to be configured to determine whether Bob should provide
   the orbit or whether the orbit will be allocated by the Park Server.
