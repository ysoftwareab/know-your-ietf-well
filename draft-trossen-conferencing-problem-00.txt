Abstract 
    
   As part of the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture [3], 
   conference course control deals with the control of running 
   conferences after the creation of the initial conference state with 
   respect to the membership and access control during runtime of the 
   session. The spectrum of scenarios reaches from small multiparty 
   gatherings up to large scaled meetings with a high fluctuation of 
   userÆs membership and activity. 
    
   This document identifies the problem areas to define the scope of 
   conference course control efforts within the IETF.

1.     Introduction 
    
   Interactive collaborative scenarios like remote meetings, virtual 
   classrooms, or sharing applications via the Internet have become 
   more and more popular in the past ten years. 
    
   According to [3], the term 'conferencing' is considered in the 
   remainder of this document as synchronous, real-time communication, 
   specifically including audio and video media but also shared data 
   media such as whiteboards, among a set of members. Several, probably 
   independently implemented, agents for media handling and control 
   purposes have to be coordinated and synchronized during runtime of 
   the conference, referred to as 'conference course control' in the 
   following, after creating the initial conference state as part of 
   the conferencing setup functionality. The provided functionality 
   with respect to conference course control usually depends on the 
   considered scenario in which it is needed.  
    
   In the following, the scope of conferencing course control as well 
   as a problem statement will be pinpointed. Furthermore, scenarios 
   for multimedia conferencing in the Internet are categorized,

   reaching from small closed meetings to large plenary sessions with 
   high fluctuations regarding the participantÆs activity and 
   interests. Since the focus of the document is on control issues in 
   conferencing, data delivery aspects are left out of consideration. 
    
   The scenario findings are then used to define models for conference 
   course control provision. 
    
   Moreover, current conferencing solutions are briefly evaluated 
   concerning their shortcomings in conference course control 
   functionality. Finally, next steps for conference course control 
   efforts will be presented. 
    
2.     Definition of Terms 
    
   o Application session (AS), Session 
     The set of media agents/applications that act as peers to each  
     other within a conference.  For real-time data, this generally  
     will be an RTP session; for other application protocols, other  
     horizontal protocols may define their own type of session concept.  
    
   o Participant 
     A human being that takes part in a conference, either actively or  
     passively listening. 
    
   o Active Participant 
     A participant of a conference becoming sender of media information  
     during lifetime of the conference. 
    
   o Passive Participant 
     A participant of a conference passively receiving the media  
     information without becoming sender of media information  
     during lifetime of the conference. 
    
   o Member 
     The system, including software and hardware, that takes part in a    
     computer conference, representing a single participant. 
    
   o Profile 
     An initial description of the conference, including assignment of  
     roles to particular members, time limits for speakers, attributes  
     of the conference (open/close, conducted/anarchic, etc). 
    
   o Conference Setup and Discovery 
     According to [3], aspects for setting up an initial conference  
     State in participating members, including the exchange of media  
     and capabilities information among the set of participants, are  
     being addressed by setup and discovery functionality. 
    
   o Conference Course Control 
     According to [3], aspects to control the conference during runtime  
     of the event are being addressed by conference course control.

   o Membership Model 
     A certain model assumed for the membership of a session. In the  
     remainder of the document, the following models are considered: 
     * open model   : everyone can join a session without restriction 
     * closed model : only pre-determined, pre-announced, or end  
                      systems determined during runtime can join a  
                      session 
     * static model : the group of participants does not change during  
                      runtime of the session. 
     * dynamic model: the group of participants might change during  
                      runtime of the session. 
     The following combinations are considered in the remainder of the      
     Document: open, closed/static, closed/dynamic 
    
3.     Scope 
    
   The scope of conference course control functionality will be 
   developed as part of the solution space. Possible functionality 
   includes: 
    
   o 'conference context administration', providing membership  
     and application/session information administration 
   o 'membership enforcement', providing means to enforce specific  
     conference membership 
   o 'floor control', providing means to map social protocols onto  
     distributed environments. However, the semantics of specific  
     social protocols is not within the scope of the possible  
     conference course control solution. 
   o 'active/passive member support', allowing for different policies  
     with respect to membership and floor control. This includes  
     changes from active to passive and vice versa, either implicitly  
     or explicitly. 
   o 'capabilities re-negotiation', allowing for changes in  
     the initial capabilities set of participants during runtime of the  
     conference. 
   o 'transport requirements', defining the requirements of underlying  
     transport protocols to provide certain functionality regarding    
     conference course control 
    
   This list does not claim to be exhaustive. However, it points in the 
   direction of provided functionality for conference course control 
   solutions. 
    
4.     Problem Statement 
    
   There are many approaches in the research community to realize 
   conference course control as part of a conferencing architecture. 
   Also in standardization bodies (such as H.323 [7] or SCCP [1]), 
   conference course control has been addressed. However, none of these 
   approaches offers a unified and flexible solution for conference 
   course control to cover the spectrum of scenarios outlined in 
   Section 5. 
    
     
Trossen                 Expires November 2001                     [4] 
Internet Draft     Course Control Problem Statement           May 2001 
    
    
   Specifically, a conference course control solution should 
    
   o fit into the already defined conference control architecture and  
     leverage the existing suite of mechanisms and protocols, such as  
     * conference description, i.e., SDP [4] or future versions (SDG-ng  
       [9]), and initiation, i.e., SIP [5] 
     * local coordination, i.e., MBUS [10] 
     * transport layer protocols, such as for reliable multicast, real- 
       time transfer, or simple unicast transmission 
     * security components, such as group key solutions 
   o provide a flexible solution, allowing for a variety of scenarios  
     (see Section 5) and characteristics to be plugged in the system.  
    
   For that, a building block approach would allow the provision of 
   standardized interfaces to the desired common functionality. With 
   that, specific scenario-tailored instantiations for certain 
   functionality, represented by a building block, are enabled 
   preserving the common view of the conference course control 
   functionality. 
    
    
5.     Conferencing Scenarios 
    
   This section informally outlines scenario categories for multimedia 
   conferencing in the Internet.  
    
   The conferencing scenarios are categorized in three sections. For 
   each category, typical characteristics are outlined, and examples 
   are given. Finally, a table-wise overview is derived from the more 
   informal description pinpointing the very functionality required for 
   the specific scenarios. This table-wise description will be used in 
   Section 5 to discuss conference course control models. 
    
   It is worth mentioning that simple streaming is not considered in 
   the following due to its lack of conference course control 
   functionality. However, it might be used to realize very simple 
   conferencing scenarios such as Internet lectures, where data is 
   simply sent to a set of receivers without feedback or interaction.  
    
5.1.   Simple Conferencing 
    
   'Simple Conferencing' reflects the simplest form of conferencing 
   with a change of the sender/receiver relation based on certain 
   'social rules' during the lifetime of the conference. 
    
   Conferences of this type might be announced beforehand, including 
   the conferenceÆs profile information, or they take place as ad-hoc 
   meetings.  
    
   The group of participants might be well-known, if announced, or be 
   built by invitation or request. For that, several initiation models 
   might be realized (see also [11]), which requires appropriate 
     
Trossen                 Expires November 2001                     [5] 
Internet Draft     Course Control Problem Statement           May 2001 
    
    
   initiation functionality including authentication and authorization 
   means for restricted access to the conference.  
    
   Floor control functionality, e.g., to realize conducted meeting 
   functionality, is not provided in this category. Due to this lack of 
   mediation concerning the access on the common media resource, the 
   level of interactivity is usually limited, even if scalable 
   multicast transfer is used.  
    
   Usually, the initial set of capabilities is not changed, i.e., re-
   negotiated, during runtime of the conference. However, some simple 
   form of re-negotiation could be provided. 
    
   Although the number of participants can easily reach several 
   thousands or even more, when using multicast transfer capabilities, 
   it is expected that the requirements for precise membership 
   information are less stringent in larger scaled conferences. 
    
5.1.1. Examples 
    
   Examples for simple conferencing include ad-hoc or pre-planned small 
   group meetings, rich calls, Internet lectures, tele-working in a 
   team. Most of the current MBone [2] sessions are typical examples 
   for simple conferencing. 
    
5.2.   Floor Controlled Conferencing 
    
   Scenarios of this category enrich the simple conferencing 
   functionality of section 5.1. by providing floor control facilities 
   to control the access on distributed resources. Among others, these 
   distributed resources might reflect the commonly used audiovisual 
   channel within the conference but also the content of a shared 
   whiteboard, or a shared, locally hosted application. The floor 
   control semantics are usually known beforehand, or they might be 
   distributed using the conference profile information. The 
   realization of the floor control semantics is usually highly 
   application-specific. 
    
   For instance, floor controlled conferencing might allow 'conducted 
   meetings', enabling the conductor of a conference for instance to 
   eject participants from a conference or to deny access to the 
   conference. However, in addition to the realization of the social 
   rules by means of floor control, appropriate functionality to 
   enforce them on data level is required by means of excluding 
   receiver sets from reception. 
    
   Capabilities re-negotiation is usually provided in these scenarios, 
   which might also be tied to the implemented floor control policy of 
   the specific scenario. 
    
   In floor controlled conferences, there is an exact knowledge of the 
   current membership information of the participants. Usually, the 
   implementation of the floor control restricts the scalability of 
     
Trossen                 Expires November 2001                     [6] 
Internet Draft     Course Control Problem Statement           May 2001 
    
    
   this type of conferences to a few tens. However, approaches as 
   proposed in [13], might be used in specific scenarios to improve the 
   scalability. 
    
5.2.1. Examples 
    
   Examples for floor controlled conferences include scenarios with the 
   need to realize social rules or access control on shared resources, 
   such as conducted meetings, application sharing sessions, distance 
   learning including demonstration of shared information, tele-working 
   with common resources to share. 
    
5.3.   Rich Conferencing 
    
   A 'rich conferencing' event, which is going to happen, might be 
   announced beforehand but an ad-hoc establishment might also be 
   considered, such as a 'randomly gathering a crowd around an 
   attraction'. Authentication and authorization means might be used 
   for restricted access to the event. 
    
   Usually, there is a (small) well-known group of active participants, 
   i.e., exact membership information is required, and a larger group 
   of passive participants. Membership information for this larger 
   group is less strictly provided, comparable with 'blue sheets' 
   attendees lists.  
    
   The access control within the group of active participants is 
   realized by means of floor control realizing specific social 
   interactions (conducted session, panel group) similar to floor 
   controlled conferencing. 
    
   As a specific characteristic of this category, frequent changes 
   between active and passive participation in the conference are 
   happening, e.g., a passive observer (participant) of the event might 
   raise its interest in becoming active in the discussion, either by 
   own request or by invitation, following the specific access rules of 
   the active participant group implemented by appropriate floor 
   control means. The mode change could happen 'explicitly', i.e., by 
   joining the active member group, or 'implicitly', i.e., by 
   requesting floor control services. 
    
   This mode change should be possible in the reverse direction, too, 
   i.e., when an active participant looses interest in active 
   participation. 
    
5.3.1. Examples 
    
   Examples for large scale rich conferencing scenarios are town hall 
   meetings, IETF working group meetings, virtual lectures with 
   feedback, virtual newsgroups. However, examples for simple and floor 
   controlled conferencing are also applicable for this category due to 
   the superset character of the rich conferencing category compared to 
   the other ones.

5.4.   Summary of Characteristics 
    
   The following table summarizes the main characteristics for the 
   different scenario categories presented in section 5.1. to 5.3. 
   '(+)' indicates optional functionality.

6.     Conference Course Control Models 
    
   The conferencing scenarios in Section 5 can easily be mapped onto 
   models for realize conference course control realization with 
   respect to the functionalities presented in Section 2. 
    
6.1.   Loose Conference Course Control 
    
   'Loose' conference course control (also referred to as 'light-weight 
   session control' [3]) is the model applicable for the simple 
   conferencing scenario category of Section 5.1.  
    
   Hence, this control model lacks of explicit membership and 
   application session control. Furthermore, floor control facilities 
   are not provided. However, membership information might be gathered 
   during runtime of the session, comparable with the blue sheets of 
   attendees. 
    
   Usually, group key mechanisms are also missing for membership 
   enforcement after starting the conference. 
    
6.2.   Tight Conference Course Control 
    
   'Tight' conference course control [3] is the model applicable for 
   the floor control conferencing scenario categories of Section 5.2. 
    
   Hence, additional floor control information of the conference 
   profile or statically implemented application semantic are used for 
   implementing floor control to map 'social protocol' semantics onto 
   the distributed scenario. Exact membership and application session 
   information is usually provided together with membership enforcement 
   based on floor control policies during runtime of the conference.

6.3.   'Jelly-like' Conference Course Control 
    
   As a combination of the loose and tight control model of Section 
   6.1. and 6.2., 'jelly-like' course control is considered for rich 
   conferencing (see Section 5.3.) realization. 
    
   The tight control model is applied for the active participants in 
   the conference, while a loose control model is used for the passive 
   ones. In addition to the functionality for the specific user group, 
   i.e., active or passive, mechanisms to support mode changes from 
   active to passive and vice versa might be required without 
   disturbance, i.e., interruption, of the running conference. 
    
   Different policies for this mode change should be feasible, such as 
   upon invitation by individual active participants or upon request of 
   the passive participant. 
    
7.     Existing Solutions 
    
   The following section is briefly evaluating existing conferencing 
   solutions with respect to their conference course control 
   functionality. Note that this presentation is restricted to systems 
   based on certain standards, hence this list does not claim to be an 
   exhaustive review of existing conferencing systems. 
    
   The following, intertwined, criteria are used to evaluate these 
   solutions: 
   o Provided Functionality: What functionality is provided with  
     respect to Table 1? 
   o Flexibility: What scenarios are covered? What policies are  
     provided? How flexible is the provided functionality? 
   o Extendibility: To what extent can the solution be extended to  
     integrate new functionality? 
   o Scalability: What restrictions due to architecture? 
    
7.1.   H.32x Protocol Suite 
    
   o Functionality:  
     - centralized/decentralized conferencing 
     - pretty much aiming at floor controlled conferencing, although  
       only conducted/non-conducted modes supported 
     - No passive/active notion in the original H.32x, H.332 extension  
       doesnÆt support changes of listeners to active users. 
      
   o Flexibility:  
     - Floor controlled conferencing is poorly supported, although the  
       data conferencing part supports tokens.  
     - Pre-defined role models, i.e., conducted versus non-conducted,  
       for audiovisual part.  
     - No policy definition, e.g., using appropriate profile  
       information. 
     - reconfiguration of running conferences poorly supported.

   o Extendibility: 
     - pretty closed system of a whole set of standards 
    
   o Scalability: very restricted due to tight centralized control  
     structure 
    
   [TBD] add other points, either items or subitems 
    
7.2.   SIP-based Solutions 
    
   o Functionality:  
     - flexible initiation models [11]  
     - membership information using RTCP information (loose control) or      
       a-priori information 
     - no membership enforcement 
     - no floor control 
     - no capability re-negotiation 
    
   o Flexibility/Extendibility: 
     - extension possible by adding conference course control  
       functionality as separated component due to open system  
       character 
     - other scenarios possible by adding functionality 
    
   o Scalability: depends on the initiation model, but most likely  
     similar to the simple conferencing category (see Section 5.1) 
    
   [TBD] add other points, either items or subitems 
    
7.3.   Transport Layer Solutions 
    
   Mostly implementing certain session control functionality for 
   specific media types, such as streaming (RTSP), reliable multicast, 
   and so on 
    
   [TBD] show need to provide transport layer independent functionality 
   which is to be mapped onto specific layer solutions. 
    
    
8.     Next Steps 
    
   The following items are proposed as next steps: 
    
   o Definition of requirements 
   o Proposal for provided services 
   o Proposal of protocol solutions 
   o Analysis of protocol solutions 
   o Recommendation of conference course control service and protocol 
    
   A crucial part of the analysis work is to study existing solutions 
   with respect to their applicability and their alignment with the 
   defined scope of Section 2 and the problem statement in Section 3.

9.     Security Considerations 
 
   This document merely discusses problem statements motivating the 
   need for conference course control mechanisms. Security is an issue 
   for conference course control but is considered in subsequent 
   solution-space documents.
