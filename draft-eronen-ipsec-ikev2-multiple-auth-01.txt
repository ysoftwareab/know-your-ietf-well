   authentication servers are used, they can belong to different
   administrative domains, such as the network access provider and the
   service provider.

Internet-Draft      Multiple Auth. Exchanges in IKEv2         March 2006


1.  Introduction

   IKEv2 [IKEv2] supports several mechanisms for parties involved in the
   IKE_SA.  These include signatures with public-key certificates,
   shared secrets, and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods.

   Currently, each endpoint uses only one of these mechanisms to
   authenticate itself.  However, there are scenarios where making the
   authorization decision in IKEv2 (whether to allow access or not)
   would benefit from using several of these methods.

   For instance, it may be necessary to authenticate both the host
   (machine) requesting access, and the user currently using the host.
   These two authentications would use two separate sets of credentials
   (such as certificates and associated private keys), or even different
   authentication mechanisms.

   To take an another example, when an operator is hosting a VPN gateway
   service for a third party, it may be necessary to authenticate the
   client both to the operator (for billing purposes) and the third
   party's AAA server (for authorizing access to the third party's
   internal network).

   This document specifies an extension to IKEv2 that allows the use of
   multiple authentication exchanges, either using different mechanisms
   or the same mechanism.  This extension allows, for instance,
   performing certificate-based authentication of the client host
   followed by an EAP authentication of the user.

   Each authentication exchange requiring communication with backend AAA
   servers may be directed to different backend AAA servers, located
   even in different administrative domains.  However, details of the
   communication between the IKEv2 gateway and the backend
   authentication servers are beyond the scope of this document.  In
   particular, this document does not specify any changes to existing
   AAA protocols, and does not require the use of any particular AAA
   protocol.

   In case of several EAP authentications, it is important to notice
   that they are not a "sequence" (as described in Section 2.1 of
   [EAP]), but separate EAP conversations independent of each other.
   Usually, they are also terminated in different EAP servers.  This is
   similar to the separate Network Access Provider (NAP) and Internet
   Service Provider (ISP) authentication exchanges in [PANA].  The
   discovery of the appropriate EAP server for each EAP authentication
   conversation is based on AAA routing.

1.1.  Usage Scenarios

   Figure 1 shows an example architecture of an operator hosted VPN
   scenario that could benefit from a two phase authentication within
   the IKEv2 exchange.  First the client authenticates towards the
   Network Access Provider (NAP) and gets access to the NAP-hosted VPN
   gateway.  The first phase authentication involves the backend AAA
   server of the NAP.  After the first authentication, the client
   initiates the second authentication round that also involves Third
   Party's backend AAA server.  If both authentications succeed, the
   required IPsec tunnels are set up and the client can access protected
   networks behind the Third Party.


       Client                         *Network Access Provider*
     +---------+                    +---------+              +-----+

                            IPsec or  /                  AAA    |

                                    /                           |
                                   v                            |
                           +---------+    *Third Party*         v
                           |3rd Party|                       +-----+

                           |         |                       | AAA |
                           +---------+                       +-----+

          Figure 1: Two phase authentication used to gain access to
          the Third Party network via Network Access Provider. AAA
          traffic goes through NAP's AAA server.

   The NAP's AAA server can be used to proxy the AAA traffic to the
   Third Party's backend AAA server.  Alternatively, the AAA traffic
   from the NAP's tunnel endpoint could go directly to the Third Party's
   backend AAA servers.  However, this is more or less an AAA routing
   issue.

2.  Solution

2.1.  Solution Overview

   The peers announce support for this IKEv2 extension by including a
   MULTIPLE_AUTH_SUPPORTED notification in the IKE_SA_INIT response
   (responder) and the first IKE_AUTH request (initiator).

   If both peers support this extension, either of them can announce
   that it wishes to have a second authentication by including an
   ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS notification in any IKE_AUTH message that
   contains an AUTH payload.  This indicates that the peer sending the
   ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS wishes to authenticate another set of
   credentials to the other peer.  The next IKE_AUTH message sent by
   this peer will contain a second identity payload (IDi) and starts
   another authentication exchange.

   It is assumed that both peers know what credentials they want to
   present; there is no negotiation about, for instance, what type of
   authentication is to be done.  As in IKEv2, EAP-based authentication
   is always requested by the initiator (by omitting the AUTH payload).

   The AUTH payloads are calculated as specified in [IKEv2] Section 2.15
   and 2.16.  If EAP methods that do not generated shared keys are used,
   it is possible that several AUTH payloads with identical contents are
   sent.  With this kind of EAP methods, the purpose of the AUTH payload
   is simply to delimit the authentication exchanges, and ensure that
   the IKE_SA_INIT request/response messages were not modified.

2.2.  Example 1: Multiple EAP Authentications

   Figure 2 shows certificate-based authentication of the responder
   followed by an EAP authentication exchange (messages 1-10).  When the
   first EAP exchange is ending (the initiator is sending its AUTH
   payload), the initiator announces that it wishes to have a second
   authentication exchange by including an ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS
   notification (message 9).

   After this, a second authentication exchange begins.  The initiator
   sends a new IDi payload but no AUTH payload (message 11), indicating
   that EAP will be used.  After that, an another EAP authentication
   exchange follows (messages 12-18).

3.  Payload Formats

3.1.  MULTIPLE_AUTH_SUPPORTED Notify Payload

   The MULTIPLE_AUTH_SUPPORTED notification is included in the
   IKE_SA_INIT response to indicate that the responder supports this
   specification.  The Notify Message Type is TBD-BY-
   IANA1(16396..40959).  The Protocol ID and SPI Size fields MUST be set
   to zero, and there is no data associated with this Notify type.

3.2.  ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS Notify Payload

   The ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS notification payload is included in an
   IKE_AUTH request containing an AUTH payload to indicate that the
   initiator wants to continue with another authentication exchange.
   The Notify Message Type is TBD-BY-IANA2(16396..40959).  The Protocol
   ID and SPI Size fields MUST be set to zero, and there is no data
   associated with this Notify type.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new IKEv2 notifications,
   MULTIPLE_AUTH_SUPPORTED and ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS, whose values are to
   be allocated from the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types" namespace defined
   in [IKEv2].

   This document does not define any new namespaces to be managed by

   IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for IKEv2 are discussed in [IKEv2].  The
   reader is encouraged to pay special attention to considerations
   relating to the use of EAP methods which do not generate shared keys.

   However, the use of multiple authentication exchanges result in some
   new security considerations as well.

   In normal IKEv2, the initiator authenticates the responder before
   revealing its identity.  When multiple authentication exchanges are
   used to authenticate the responder, the initiator has to reveal its
   identity before all of the responder authentication exchanges have
   been completed.
