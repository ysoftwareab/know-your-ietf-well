                   Email Authentication Status Codes
                 draft-ietf-appsawg-email-auth-codes-07

Abstract

   This document registers code points to allow status codes to be
   returned to an email client to indicate that a message is being
   rejected or deferred specifically because of email authentication
   failures.

   This document updates [RFC7208] since some of the code points
   registered replace the ones recommended for use in that document.

Internet-Draft           Email Auth Status Codes             August 2014


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3463] introduced Enhanced Mail System Status Codes, and [RFC5248]
   created an IANA registry for these.

   [RFC6376] and [RFC7208] introduced, respectively, DomainKeys
   Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF), two
   protocols for conducting message authentication.  Another common
   email acceptance test is the reverse Domain Name System (DNS) check
   on an email client's IP address, as described in Section 3 of
   [RFC7001].

   The current set of enhanced status codes does not include any code
   for indicating that a message is being rejected or deferred due to
   local policy reasons related to any of these mechanisms.  This is
   potentially useful information to agents that need more than
   rudimentary handling information about the reason a message was
   rejected on receipt.  This document introduces enhanced status codes
   for reporting those cases to clients.

   Section 3.2 updates [RFC7208], as new enhanced status codes relevant
   to that specification are being registered and recommended for use.

2.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  New Enhanced Status Codes

   The following new enhanced status codes are defined:

3.1.  DKIM Failure Codes

   In the code point definitions below, the following definitions are
   used:

   passing:  A signature is "passing" if the basic DKIM verification
      algorithm as defined in [RFC6376] succeeds.

   acceptable:  A signature is "acceptable" if it satisfies all locally
      defined requirements (if any) in addition to passing the basic
      DKIM verification algorithm (e.g., certain header fields are
      included in the signed content; no partial signatures; etc.).

      Sample Text:        No passing DKIM signature found

      Description:        This status code is returned when a message
                          did not contain any passing DKIM
                          signatures.  (This violates the
                          advice of Section 6.1 of RFC6376.)

      Sample Text:        No acceptable DKIM signature found
      Associated basic status code:  550
      Description:        This status code is returned when a message
                          contains one or more passing DKIM signatures,
                          but none are acceptable.  (This violates the

      Sample Text:        No valid author-matched DKIM signature found
      Associated basic status code:  550
      Description:        This status code is returned when a message
                          contains one or more passing DKIM
                          signatures, but none are acceptable because
                          none have an identifier(s)
                          that matches the author address(es) found in
                          the From header field.  This is a special
                          case of X.7.21.  (This violates the advice
                          of Section 6.1 of RFC6376.)

4.  General Considerations

   By the nature of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), only one
   enhanced status code can be returned for a given exchange between
   client and server.  However, an operator might decide to defer or
   reject a message for a plurality of reasons.  Clients receiving these
   codes need to consider that the failure reflected by one of these
   status codes might not reflect the only reason, or the most important
   reason, for non-acceptance of the message or command.

   It is important to note that Section 6.1 of [RFC6376] discourages
   special treatment of messages bearing no valid DKIM signature.  There
   are some operators that disregard this advice, a few of which go so
   far as to require a valid Author Domain signature (that is, one
   matching the domain(s) in the From header field) in order to accept
   the message.  Moreover, some nascent technologies built atop SPF and
   DKIM depend on such authentications.  This work does not endorse
   configurations that violate DKIM's recommendations, but rather
   acknowledges that they do exist and merely seeks to provide for
   improved interoperability with such operators.

   A specific use case for these codes is mailing list software, which
   processes rejections in order to remove from the subscriber set those
   addresses that are no longer valid.  There is a need in that case to
   distinguish authentication failures versus indications that the
   recipient address is no longer valid.

   If a receiving server performs multiple authentication checks, and
   more than one of them fails thus warranting rejection of the message,
   the SMTP server SHOULD use the code that indicates multiple methods
   failed rather than only reporting the first one that failed.  It may
   be the case that one method is always expected to fail, and thus
   returning that method's specific code is not information useful to
   the sending agent.

   The reverse IP DNS check is defined in Section 2.6.3 of [RFC7001].

Internet-Draft           Email Auth Status Codes             August 2014


   Any message authentication or policy enforcement technologies
   developed in the future should also include registration of their own
   enhanced status codes so that this kind of specific reporting is
   available to operators that wish to use them.

5.  Security Considerations

   Use of these codes reveals local policy with respect to email
   authentication, which can be useful information to actors attempting
   to deliver undesired mail.  It should be noted that there is no
   specific obligation to use these codes; if an operator wishes not to
   reveal this aspect of local policy, it can continue using a generic
   result code such as 5.7.7, 5.7.1, or even 5.7.0.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Registration of new enhanced status codes, for addition to the
   Enumerated Stauts Codes sub-registry of the SMTP Enhanced Status
   Codes Registry, can be found in Section 3.
