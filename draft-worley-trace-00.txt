Internet-Draft                 SIP Tracing                    March 2009


Abstract

   This document defines a SIP option tag, "trace", to be used within
   SIP messages to request that SIP elements (both proxies and UASs)
   that receive the message reflect to the UAC the request they received
   and the response they gave by encapsulating the request and response
   in a provisional response.  A new provisional response code "170" is
   defined to carry the request and response.  This option tag is
   expected to be used solely for diagnostic purposes.

Internet-Draft                 SIP Tracing                    March 2009


1.  Purpose of the 'trace' option tag

   Currently it is very difficult to determine the routing of an out-of-
   dialog SIP request, even in situations without forking.  In practice,
   the usual method is to obtain some identification of the request
   (usually the Call-Id value) and search through detailed logs taken at
   every SIP element that the request might have passed through.  While
   effective tools to carry this out can be constructed for any
   particular SIP system, interoperation between different SIP systems
   rapidly makes this technique infeasible even if the systems have no
   policy of information-hiding regarding each other.

   The purpose of this Internet-Draft is to propose an option tag,
   "trace" which requests that all recipients of all forks of a request
   echo a copy of the received request and the recipient's final
   response in a provisional response.  A new provisional response code,
   "170", is defined to carry these echos.

   Generally, retrieving tracing data is a difficult problem.  An
   advantage of this technique for message tracing is that it uses SIP
   transport to gather the tracing information, which is the only
   transport mechanism that we have certain knowledge works.

   The request and response copies carried in the 170 responses can be
   reassembled into the forking tree by examining their Via branch
   parameters.  If the SIP elements involved implement the History-Info
   header, further information about the causes and consequences of the
   forks can be obtained.

2.  Syntax and Semantics

   This Internet-Draft defines a new option-tag, "trace".  If a SIP
   element which supports this option-tag receives a request containing
   "Supported: trace", the element SHOULD send a provisional response
   with status code 170 containing a body that contains the request and
   the final response that the element generated to the request.
   Stateless proxies will omit the body part containing the final
   response and transmit the 170 response upon receiving the request,
   since a stateless proxy has no method of retaining the request
   information until the final response is generated.

   This Internet-Draft defines a new status code, "170", with the
   conventional reason-phrase "Trace".  The body of a provisional
   response with status code 170 MUST be a multipart/related body with
   one or two parts, each of which has content-type message/sipfrag.
   One of the parts is a SIP request, and if there are two parts, the
   other is a SIP response.

   A 170 response MUST NOT be sent with "Supported: 100rel", in order to
   ensure that the UAC is not compelled to send a PRACK.  In any case, a
   UAC SHOULD never send a PRACK for a 170, even if it contains
   "Supported: 100rel".  The element sending the 170 response must give
   it an appropriate to-tag, as it would with any response.  The element
   MAY choose a different to-tag from that it uses for any other
   response (especially if the element normally uses 100rel for
   provisional responses) -- the conceit is that the 170 response is
   generated by a separate UAS to which the request is forked.

   Technically, the receipt of a 170 response by a UAC establishes an
   early dialog.  However, the 170 response has no further SIP-visible
   processing associated with it, so the UAC does not need to create an
   early dialog in practice, and the UAC MAY omit adding it to its
   dialog events.  If no further responses arrive with the same to-tag
   (from the same SIP element as generated the 170), retaining an early
   dialog would have been useless.  If a further response arrives with
   the same to-tag, the early dialog would be created by the later
   response.

3.  Difficulties

   History-Info, if fully implemented by all the SIP elements, provides
   much of the information that "trace" would provide.  On the other
   hand, History-Info does not capture changes in the propagated
   requests other than the request-URIs.

   The generated 170 responses will be significantly larger than the
   requests that create them.  (This problem is similar to that in
   draft-ietf-sip-hop-limit-diagnostics.)  This is not a problem if a
   stream transport is used but can be problematic if UDP was used to
   send the request.  This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that
   provisional responses are transmitted unreliably, so if an element is
   unable to transmit a particular 170 response, it will be dropped and
   not resent.  In addition, the response pruning strategies discussed
   in draft-ietf-sip-hop-limit-diagnostics can be applied to
   substantially reduce the response size.

   This mechanism does not provide any information regarding a request
   sent to a non-responding destination, which may be a very useful
   fact.  One possible solution to that problem would be for the sending
   element to synthesize a 170 response apparently from the destination
   element, including the 408 Request Timeout response from the
   destination that the sending element has effectively synthesized.
   However, this still does not record requests sent to a non-responding
   destination if an alternative, responding destination is chosen via
   the RFC 3263 mechanisms.  This suggests that trace responses should
   be generated not by the receipt of a request, but by the sending of a
   request.

   This proposal to some degree parallels draft-kuthan-sipping-diag-00.
   The returning of copies of requests as seen by UASs covers one of the
   components of that draft.  The other component is that proxies should
   identify in some way which "rule" was used to forward a request to a
   particular request-URI.  That draft proposes to carry this
   information in an additional Via parameter.  Within the machinery of
   this draft, rule information could be added to 170 responses, but
   only if they were generated regarding outgoing requests, not incoming
   requests.

   The "trace" mechanism does not provide much diagnostic information
   regarding problems in the RFC 3263 process.  In particular, failures
   to find a responding destination host/port/transport for a request-
   URI generate no 170 responses.  This is improved if 170 responses are
   generated for transmitted requests, but the request itself does not
   carry information about the destination host and port.  (The
   transport is coded in the topmost Via header.)

5.  Security Considerations

   A service provider desiring to keep hidden the topology of its
   network will not want to permit trace data to be transmitted outward
   from their network.  This can be accomplished by removing "Supported:
   trace" from any request that enters the network, and by dropping any
   170 responses that attempt to exit the network.

   Generating trace responses increases the volume of messages generated
   by a SIP request.  However, the increase is limited to a factor
   slightly larger than 2, although the increase in message traffic is
   concentrated toward the UAC end of the forking tree. so the trace
   mechanism is particularly effective in generating a denial-of-service
   attach.  In any case, UACs SHOULD never apply "Supported: trace" to a
   message routinely.
