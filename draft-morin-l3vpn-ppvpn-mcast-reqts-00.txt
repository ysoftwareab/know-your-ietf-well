   requirements both from the end user and service provider standpoints.
   It is intended that potential solutions, that specify the support of
   IP multicast within VPNs, use these requirements as a guideline.  It
   is not the intent of this document to propose technical solutions,
   nor to detail solution specific issues.

1. Introduction


   L3VPN services satisfying requirement defined in [VPN-REQ], are now
   being offered by many service providers worldwide.  The success of
   those VPN services is certainly due to intrinsic characteristics of
   the solutions:
      - customers are unaware of the deployed network technology and
        do not need to activate specific mechanisms,


Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 2]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



      - P routers in the core are unaware of the numbers of VPN
        customers which allows a good scalability,
      - the dynamic configuration of the VPNs which minimize
        configuration operation when adding new customers


   In the meantime, there is a growing need for support of multicast
   services.  Efforts to provide efficient IP multicast routing
   protocols and multicast group management have been done in
   standardization bodies which results in particular to the definition
   of PIM [PIM-SM] [PIM-SSM] and IGMP [IGMPv1] [IGMPv2] [IGMPv3].


   However, multicast traffic is not supported natively within the
   solution defined in [RFC2547bis].  A simple solution to support
   multicast service in VPN networks consists in establishing unicast
   tunnels and replicating traffic on PEs.  Such kind of techniques have
   obvious drawbacks such as scalability, operational cost, and
   bandwidth usage.


   This document complements the generic L3 VPN requirement draft [VPN-
   REQ], by specifying additional requirements specific to multicast
   services.  It clarifies the needs from both VPN client and provider
   standpoints and formulates the problems that should be addressed by
   technical solutions with as key objective to stay solution agnostic.
   There is no intent to either specify solution specific details in
   this document or application specific requirements.


   It is intended that solutions that specify procedures and protocol
   extensions for multicast in VPN networks satisfy these requirements.


2. Conventions used in this document


2.1. Terminology


   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in [VPN-
   REQ], [RFC2547bis], [PIM-SM], [PIM-SSM].


2.2. Conventions


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


1. Problem Statement


1.1. Motivations


   More and more L3 VPN customers use IP multicast services within their
   private infrastructures.  Naturally, they want to extend these
   multicast services to remote sites that are connected via a VPN.





Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 3]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



   For instance, it could be a national TV channel with several
   geographical locations that wants to multicast a TV program from a
   central point to several regional locations within its VPN.


   A solution to support multicast traffic would consist in using
   unicast PSN tunnels and letting PE routers (provider's routers)
   replicate traffic.  This is obviously sub-optimal as it places the
   replication burden on the PE and hence has very poor scaling
   characteristics.  It also wastes bandwidth and control plane
   resources in the provider network.


   Thus, to provide multicast services for L3 VPN networks in an
   efficient manner (that is, with scalable impact on signaling and
   protocol state), in a large scale environment, new mechanisms are
   required.  Existing L3 VPN mechanisms have to be enhanced to support
   multicast services.


1.2. Requirements Overview


   This document targets provider provided IP VPN solutions designed to
   carry customer multicast traffic, with as main requirement the fact
   that a solution SHOULD first satisfy requirements documented in [VPN-
   REQ] : as much as possible, multicast service should have the same
   flavor as the unicast one, including same simplicity (technology
   unaware), the same quality of service (if any), the same management
   (e.g. monitoring of performances), etc.


   Moreover, it is also obvious that a multicast VPN solution MUST
   interoperate seamlessly with current unicast solutions.  Even if this
   is not a core requirement, it would also make sense that multicast
   VPN solutions define themselves as extensions to existing provider
   provided IP VPN solutions (such as for instance, [RFC2547bis] or
   [VR]) and privilege consistency with those.


   Finally, this document identifies multicast specific issues - most
   notably from the service provider standpoint - and thus expresses
   additional requirements specific to multicast.


1.3. Scalability vs.  optimality


   An issue has been identified as intrinsic to the transport of
   multicast VPN traffic over a service provider network, whatever the
   technical solution chosen: in the general case, there is a tension
   between resource optimization and number of state maintained.
   Thus, some trade-off has to be made, and this document will express
   some requirements related to this trade-off.


2. Operational implementation examples


   This section aims at presenting a few representative examples of
   multicast applications in a VPN context.  The goal is to highlight



Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 4]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



   how different applications and network context may have a different
   impact on how a trade-off is made.


   [to be completed]


3. Requirements for supporting IP multicast within IP PP VPNs


   Again, the aim of this draft is not to specify solutions but to give
   requirements for supporting IP multicast within IP PP VPNs.


   In order to list these requirements we have taken two different
   standpoints of two different important entities: the end user (the
   customer using the VPN) and the service provider.


   In the rest of the document, we mean by a "solution", a solution that
   allows to perform multicast into a provider provisioned IP VPN.


3.1. End user/customer standpoint


3.1.1. Service definition


   As for unicast, the multicast service should be provider provisioned
   and shall not need some extra features on the customer equipments
   (CE).


3.1.2. CE-PE routing protocols


   Between the CEs and the PEs the multicast protocols that SHOULD be
   implemented in the solution are PIM-SM [PIM-SM] (including PIM-SSM
   [PIM-SSM], and bidirectional PIM [BIDIR-PIM]), and IGMP (v1, v2 and
   v3 [IGMPv1] [IGMPv2] [IGMPv3]).


3.1.3. Quality of Service (QoS)


   First, general considerations about QoS in L3VPNs as developed in
   section 5.5 of [VPN-REQ] are also relevant to this section.


   The QoS includes various parameters such as delay, jitter, packet
   loss, and service availability expressed in percentage of time.
   These parameters are defined in the unicast current provider provided
   VPN services, are sold by the service provider to the customers and
   defined in the SLA (Service Level Agreements).


   The level of availability of multicast traffic should be on par with
   what exists for unicast traffic.  For instance traffic protection
   mechanisms SHOULD be available for customer multicast traffic when it
   is carried over the service provider network.


   The multicast in the VPN solution shall allow to define at least the
   same level of quality of service.  As multicast is often used to
   deliver high quality services such as video broadcast, the solution



Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 5]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



   should have additional features to support high QoS such as bandwidth
   reservation and call admission control.


   Moreover, a multicast VPN solution should as much as possible ensure
   that client multicast traffic packets are not lost nor duplicated,
   even if the means used to carry a client multicast data stream over
   the provider network changes.



3.1.4. SLA parameters measurement


   As SLA parameters are part of the sold service, they are often
   monitored.  The monitoring is used for technical reasons by the
   service provider and is often sold to the customer for e2e service
   purposes.


   The solution shall allow to monitor SLA parameters and may allow to
   use similar techniques (as those used by the unicast services) to
   monitor them.


   Multicast specific characteristics that may be monitored are, for
   instance, multicast statistics per stream and latency time to receive
   a multicast group traffic across the VPN.


3.1.5. Data transmission security


   Security is a key point for customer who uses a VPN solution.  The
   RFC2547 model offers some guarantees concerning the security level of
   data transmission within the VPN.


   The solution shall provide an architecture that has the same level of
   security both for the unicast and multicast traffic.


   A VPN multicast solution may choose to make the
   optimality/scalability trade-off stated in section 1.3 by
   distributing multicast traffic of a client group to a set of PE
   routers that may include PEs which are not part of the VPN.  From a
   security standpoint, this may be a problem for some VPN customers,
   thus a multicast VPN solution using such a scheme should offer ways
   to avoid this for specific customers (and/or specific customer
   multicast streams).


3.1.6. Monitoring and Troubleshooting


   Apart from obvious statistics on multicast traffic, customers of a
   multicast VPN will need information concerning the status of their
   multicast resource usage.


   Indeed, as mentioned in section 3.2.3, for scalability purpose
   service provider may limit the number (and/or throughput) of
   multicast streams that are received and produced at a client site,
   and obviously customers will need to be able to know their current


Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 6]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



   resource usage (state and throughput) and will need to receive some
   kind of alert if rejects are happening.


3.1.7. Extranet


   In current PP L3VPN models, a customer site may be setup to be part
   of multiple VPNs.  The need for a corresponding multicast feature
   will need to be assessed in further revisions of this draft, but a
   multicast solution should at least specify how it handles multicast
   traffic of a such site.


3.1.8. Multi-homing, load balancing and resiliency


   A multicast VPN solution should be compatible with current solutions
   aimed at improving the service robustness for customers such as
   multi-homing, CE-PE link load balancing and failover.  A multicast
   VPN solution should also be able to offer those same features for
   multicast traffic.


3.1.9. Addressing


   A multicast provider provided L3VPN should not impose restrictions on
   multicast group addresses used by VPN customers.


   In particular, as for unicast traffic, overlap of multicast group
   address sets used by different customers MUST be supported.


3.2. Service provider standpoint


3.2.1. Scalability


   Some currently standardized and deployed L3VPN solution have the
   major advantage of being scalable in the core regarding the number of
   customers and number of customer routes.  For instance, in the
   [RFC2547bis] model, a P router sees a number of MPLS tunnels that is
   only linked to the number of PEs and not at all to the number of
   customers.


   As far as possible, this independence in the core, with respect to
   the number of customers and to customer activity, is recommended.
   Yet, it is identified that in our context the scalability and
   resource usage optimality goals are competing, so this requirement
   may be reduced to having the possibility of bounding the quantity of
   states that the service provider needs to maintain in the core, the
   bound being independent of the multicast activity of VPN customers.


   It is expected that multicast VPN solutions will use some kind of
   point to multipoint technology to efficiently carry VPN multicast
   traffic, and that such technologies require maintaining state
   information, and will use resources in the control plane (memory and
   processing, and possibly address space).



Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 7]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



   Scalability is a key requirement for multicast VPN solutions.
   Solutions MUST be designed to scale well with an increase in the
   number of any of the following:
       - the number of PEs
       - the number of customers VPNs (total and per PE)
       - the number of PEs and sites in any VPN
       - the number of client multicast channels
         (groups or source-groups)


   Both scalability of performance and operation MUST be considered.


   Key considerations SHOULD include:
       - the processing resources needed on the control plan
         (neighborhood or session maintenance messages,
         keep-alives, timers, etc.)
       - the memory resources needed for the control plane
       - the amount of protocol information transmitted to manage
         a multicast VPN (message size)
       - the amount of potential routing extensions
       - the amount of control plane processing required on PE and P to
         add remove a customer site ( or a customer from a multicast
         session)
       - the number of multicast IP addresses used (if IP multicast
         distribution trees are used to carry customer multicast
         traffic)


   It is expected that the applicability of each solution will be
   evaluated with regards to the aforementioned scalability criteria.


   These considerations naturally lead us to believe that proposed
   solutions SHOULD offer the possibility of sharing such resources
   between different VPN multicast streams (between different VPNs,
   between different VPN multicast streams of the same or of different
   VPNs).  This means, for instance, being able to share IP multicast
   trees between several customers.


   Those scalability issues are expected to be more pregnant on P
   routers, but a multicast in VPNs solution should address both P and
   PE routers as far as scalability is concerned.


3.2.2. Resource optimization


3.2.2.1. General goals


   One of the aims of the use of multicast instead of unicast is
   resource optimization in the network.


   The two obvious things that a multicast VPN solution would want to
   avoid are useless duplication ¡ when same data travels twice or more
   on a same link (e.g. when doing ingress PE replication) - and data
   sent uselessly (e.g. PE receiving traffic they don't need).



Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 8]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



3.2.2.2. Trade-off and tuning


   But as previously stated in this document, a scalable resource
   optimal solution is probably not possible.  Thus what is expected
   from a multicast VPN solution is that it addresses the resource
   optimization issue taking into account the fact that some trade-off
   has to be made.


   Moreover, we think that a "one size fits all" trade-off probably does
   not exist either, and that the most sensible approach would be a
   versatile solution offering the providers appropriate configurable
   settings letting them tune the trade-off according to their peculiar
   constraints (network topology, platforms, customer applications,
   level of service offered etc.).


3.2.2.3. Traffic engineering


   In addition, if traffic engineering features are provided by the
   connection mode that is used between PEs for unicast traffic in the
   VPN service, the solution SHOULD provide the same for multicast
   traffic.


   The solution should offer mean to support key multicast TE objectives
   as defined in [RFC 3272].


3.2.3. Control mechanisms


   The solution must provide some mechanisms to control the source
   emission within a VPN.  This control includes the number of sources
   and/or the total bit rate of all the sources.


   At the reception level, the solution must also provide mechanisms to
   control the number of channels (group or source/group) to which a VPN
   site has subscribed and/or the total bit rate.


   All these mechanisms must be configurable by the service provider in
   order to control the amount of multicast traffic within a VPN.


   Moreover it may be desirable to be able to impose some global bound
   on the quantity of state used by a VPN in the core network for its
   multicast traffic.


3.2.4. Infrastructure security


   Concerning the infrastructure, the solution shall provide the same
   level of security for the service provider.  For instance, that means
   that the intrinsic protection against DOS and DDOS attacks of the
   BGP/MPLS solution must be the same in the multicast solution.


   Moreover, since multicast traffic and routing are intrinsically
   dynamic, some mechanism must be proposed so that the frequency of
   changes in the way client traffic is carried over the core is bounded


Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005            [Page 9]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



   and not tightly coupled to dynamic changes of multicast traffic in
   the customer network.


   Last, control mechanisms described in previous section are also to be
   considered from this infrastructure security point of view.


3.2.5. Robustness


   Resiliency is also crucial to infrastructure security, thus a
   multicast VPN solution shall whether avoid single points of failures
   or propose some technical solution making possible to implement a
   failover mechanism.


3.2.6. Management tools, OAM


   The operation of a multicast VPN solution shall be as light as
   possible and automatic configuration and discovery should be
   privileged.  Particularly the operational cost of setting up
   multicast on a PE should be as low as possible.


   Moreover, monitoring of multicast specific parameters and statistics
   should be offered to the service provider.


   Most notably the provider should have access to :
      - multicast traffic statistics
      - information about client multicast resource usage (state and
   throughput)
      - alarms when limits are reached on such resources
      - statistics on decisions related to how client traffic is carried
   on transport trees (e.g. traffic switched onto a stream specific
   multicast tree)
      - statistics on parameters that could help the provider to
   evaluate its optimality/state trade-off


3.2.7. Trouble shooting


   A multicast VPN solution that would dynamically adapt the way some
   client multicast traffic is carried over the provider network may
   incur the disadvantage of being hard to troubleshoot.


   In such a case, to help diagnose multicast network issues a multicast
   VPN solution should provide monitoring information describing how
   client traffic is carried over the network (e.g. which provider
   multicast group is used for such and such client multicast stream).
   Moreover a solution may also provide configuration options to avoid
   any dynamic changes, for multicast traffic of a particular VPN or a
   specific multicast stream (client group or source-group).


3.2.8. Inter-AS, inter provider





Morin             Informational - Expires April 2005           [Page 10]
Internet Draft   Requirements for multicast in PP IP VPNs   October 2004



   A multicast VPN solution shall support inter area, inter-AS and inter
   provider multicast VPNs.  Options A, B and C (as described in section
   10 of [RFC2547bis]) SHOULD be supported.


   Moreover such support should be possible without compromising other
   requirements of this draft, and should not incur penalty on
   scalability and bandwidth resource usage.


3.2.9. Tunneling Requirements


   Connectivity between PE devices in the backbone SHOULD be able to use
   a range of tunneling technologies, including point-to-point and
   point-to-multipoint, such as L2TP [L2TP-MCAST], IPSEC [IPSEC], GRE
   [GRE], IP-in-IP, MPLS [P2MP], etc.


   In a multicast VPN solution extending a unicast IP PP VPN solution,
   consistency in the tunneling technology has to be privileged : such a
   solution SHOULD allow the use of the same tunneling technology for
   multicast as for unicast.


3.2.10.  Architecture consideration


   As far as possible, the solution shall minimize the number of
   protocols that have to be activated within the core network, i.e. in
   the P and PE routers.


   It is desirable to maximize the re-use of existing L3 VPN techniques
   and protocols.  For instance, the same routing protocol (or an
   extension) shall be used both for unicast and multicast solution.


   Moreover, introducing new protocol specific to this issue should be
   avoided when possible (on both PE and P routers), and extensions to
   existing protocols should be preferred when relevant.


   The motivations behind those requirements are good interworking and
   troubleshooting.


3.2.11.  Compatibility


   First, it is a requirement that unicast and multicast services MUST
   be able to co-exist within the same VPN.


   A multicast VPN solution SHOULD prevent compatibility and migration
   issues, for instance by privileging mechanisms facilitating forward
   compatibility.  Most notably a solution supporting only a subset of
   those requirements SHOULD be designed to be compatible with future
   enhanced revisions.


   It SHOULD be an aim of any multicast into VPN solution to offer as
   much backward compatibility as possible.  An ideal which is probably
   impossible to achieve would be to offer multicast VPN services across
   legacy routers without any change to any router in the network.
