Abstract 
    
   To help assure healthcare privacy and security in automated systems, 
   usage data need to be collected.  These data will be reviewed by 
   administrative staff to verify that healthcare data is being used in 
   accordance with the healthcare provider's data security requirements 
   and to establish accountability for data use.  This review process is 
   called security auditing.   
    
   This document defines the format of the data to be collected and 
   minimum set of attributes that need to be captured by healthcare 
   application systems for subsequent use by an automation-assisted 
   review application.  The data includes records of who accessed 
   healthcare data, when, for what action, from where, and which 
   patients' records were involved.  The data definition is an XML 
   schema to be used as a reference by healthcare standards developers 
   and application designers.

1. Purpose 
    
   The purposes the document fulfills are to: 
    
   1) Define data to be communicated for evidence of compliance with, 
      and violations of, a healthcare enterprise's security and privacy 
      policies and objectives. 
         
      The focus of auditing in this document is to retrospectively 
      detect and report security/privacy breaches, versus directly 
      inhibiting access.  This includes capturing data that supports 
      individual accountability for patient record creation, access, 
      updates, and deletions.  It does not include real-time access 
      alarm actions since there is a perception in the healthcare 
      community that security measures that inhibit access may also 
      inhibit effective patient care, under some circumstances. 
       
      This document does not define healthcare security and privacy 
      policies or objectives.

   2) Depict the data that would potentially reside in a common audit 
      engine or database. 
       
      Privacy and security audit data is to be collected on each 
      hardware system, and there are likely to be separate local data 
      stores for system-level and application-level audits.  Collating 
      these records and providing a common view - transcending hardware 
      system boundaries - is seen as necessary for cost-effective 
      security and privacy policy administration.   
       
      The data definitions support such a collation, but the technical 
      implementation alternatives are not covered in this document. 
    
   3) Depict data that allows useful queries against audited events. 
       
      Audit data, in its raw form, reflects a sequential view of system 
      activity.  Useful inquiries for security and privacy 
      administration need workflow, business process, organizational, 
      role, and person-oriented views.  Data definitions in this 
      document anticipate and support creating those views and queries, 
      but do not define them.   
       
   4) Provide a common reference standard for healthcare IT standards 
      development organizations. 
       
      This document consolidates previously disjoint viewpoints from 
      Health Level 7 (HL7)[3], Digital Imaging and Communications in 
      Medicine (DICOM) Working Group 14, Integrating the Healthcare 
      Enterprise (IHE)[4], the ASTM International Healthcare Informatics 
      Technical Committee (ASTM E31)[5], and the Joint NEMA/COCIR/JIRA 
      Security and Privacy Committee[6].  It is intended as a reference 
      for these four groups and other healthcare standards developers. 
       
      By specifying an XML schema, this document anticipates extensions 
      to the base schema to meet requirements of healthcare standards 
      bodies and application developers.      
    
2. Scope 
    
2.1  Data Collection  
    
   This document specifies audit data to be collected and communicated 
   from automated systems.  It does not include non-automated processes.  
    
   Data for events in the above categories may be selectively collected, 
   based on healthcare organization policy.  This document does not 
   specify any baseline or minimal policies.     
    


 
 
Marshall                Expires - October 2003                [Page 3] 
Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   For each audited event, this document specifies the minimal data 
   requirements plus optional data for the following event categories: 
    
   1) Security administrative events - establishing and maintaining 
      security policy definitions, secured object definitions, role 
      definitions, user definitions, and the relationships among them.  
      In general, these events are specific to the administrative 
      applications. 
       
   2) Audit access events - reflecting special protections implemented 
      for the audit trail itself. 
    
   3) Security-mediated events - recording entity identification and 
      authentication, data access, function access, nonrepudiation, 
      cryptographic operations, and data import/export for messages and 
      reports.  In general, these events are generic to all protected 
      resources, without regard to the application data content. 
       
   4) Patient care data events - documenting what was done, by whom, 
      using which resources, from what access points, and to whose 
      medical data.  In general, these audits are application-specific 
      since they require knowledge of the application data content. 
    
   Security subsystems found in most system infrastructures include a 
   capability to capture system-level security relevant events like 
   logon and security object accesses.  This document does not preclude 
   such functions being enabled to record and supply the data defined in 
   this document, but transformation to conform to the common XML schema 
   definition will be required. 
    
   Application-level events, such as patient record access, are not 
   captured by system-level security audits.  The defined data support 
   applications' record access auditing for healthcare institutional 
   security and privacy assurance plus related policy administration 
   functions.   
    
   System-local data definitions for collection and storage of audit 
   data, prior to transformation to a common schema and transmission to 
   a common repository, are not included in this document. 
    
2.2  Anticipated Data End-uses  
    
   This document anticipates, but does not define, end-uses for the data 
   collected. 
    
   The typical healthcare IT environment contains many systems from 
   various vendors and developers who have not implemented common or 
   interoperable security administrative functions.  This document 
   anticipates a requirement to transmit data from several unrelated

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   systems to a common repository.  It also anticipates the aggregated 
   data may then be queried and viewed an a variety of ways.   
    
   There are distinctions of detail granularity, specificity, and 
   frequency between audit data required for surveillance versus 
   forensic purposes.  While some surveillance data may useful for 
   forensics, the scope of this document is limited to surveillance. 
    
   This document does not address access real-time policy violation 
   alarm actions.  There is a perception in the healthcare community 
   that security measures that inhibit access may also inhibit effective 
   patient care, under some circumstances.   
    
   This document does not define any data for patient care consents or 
   patients' permissions for data disclosure.  It is conceivable that 
   the proposed audit data could be input to such applications, however, 
   assuming strict access controls for audit data have been established. 
    
   This document does not define system-specific or application-specific 
   data that may be collected and reported in addition to the defined 
   elements.  For example, it is conceivable that audit mechanisms may 
   be useful for tracking financial or payroll transactions.  At the 
   same time, this document does not preclude extending the XML schema 
   to incorporate additional data. 
    
   There is a potential requirement for a set of administrative messages 
   to be sent from a central source to each participating system to 
   uniformly specify, control, enable, or disable audit data collection.  
   Such messages are not included in this document. 
    
2.3  Conformance 
    
   This document does not include any definitions of conformance 
   practices.  Instead, it anticipates that standards development 
   organizations that reference this document may specify their own 
   conformance requirements. 
    
3. Goals 
       
3.1  Effective Data Gathering 
    
   The process of assuring that security policies are implemented 
   correctly is essential to information security administration.  It is 
   a set of interrelated tasks all aimed at maintaining an acceptable 
   level of confidence that security protections are, in fact, working 
   as intended.  These tasks are assisted by data from automated 
   instrumentation of system and application functions. 
    
   Data gathered from a secured environment is used to accumulate 
   evidence that security systems are working as intended and to detect 
 
 
Marshall                Expires - October 2003                [Page 5] 
Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   incidents and patterns of misuse for further actions.  Once messages 
   have been collected, various reports may be created in support of 
   security assurance and administration information requirements. 
    
   When a site runs multiple heterogeneous applications, each 
   application system may have its own security mechanisms - user logon, 
   roles, access right permissions and restrictions, etc.  Each 
   application system also has its own security log file that records 
   security relevant events, e.g., login, data access, and updates to 
   the security policy databases.  A system administrator or security 
   auditor must examine each of these log files to find security 
   relevant incidents.  Not only is it difficult to examine each of 
   these files separately, the format and contents of each file may be 
   confusingly different.  
    
   Resolving these issues requires a framework to: 
    
   -  Maximize interoperability and the meaningfulness of data across 
      applications and sites 
   -  Minimize ambiguity among heterogeneous systems 
   -  Simplify and limits costs for administrative audit tasks. 
    
3.2  Efficiency 
    
   One of the leading concerns about auditing is the potential volume of 
   data gathering and its impact on application system performance.  
   Although this document does not prescribe specific implementations or 
   strategies, the following are meant as informative guidance for 
   development. 
    
   1) Audits should be created for transactions or record-level data 
      access, not for individual attribute-level changes to data. 
    
   2) This document does not discourage locally optimized gathering of 
      audit data on each application system.  Instead, it anticipates 
      implementation-defined periodic gathering and transmission of data 
      to a common repository.  This common repository would be optimized 
      for after-the-fact audit queries and reporting, thus unburdening 
      each application system of those responsibilities.  It is also 
      important to keep the message size compact so that audit data will 
      not penalize normal network operation. 
    
   3) On each application system, a variety of policy-based methods 
      could be employed to optimize data gathering and storage, e.g., 
      selective auditing of only events defined as important plus 
      workload buffering and balancing.  Data gathering itself should be 
      stateless to avoid the overhead of transactional semantics.  In 
      addition, prior to transmission, some filtering, aggregation, and 
      summarization of repeated events would reduce the number of 
      messages.  Audit data storage and integrity on each application 
 
 
Marshall                Expires - October 2003                [Page 6] 
Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

      system need only be scaled for relatively low-volume and short-
      duration requirements, yet be consistent with implementation-
      defined minimums for holding the data for subsequent collection. 
    
   4) Leveraging existing data collection should be considered.  For 
      example, most commercial security subsystems record events in a 
      local common log file, so the log file data can be extracted for 
      communication to a common repository.  Also, it is common is some 
      systems' designs to have a transaction log for data reconstruction 
      in event of database loss, so collecting data-update audit data 
      within this subsystem could reduce impact on application system 
      performance. 
    
   5) A security audit repository would gather all audit message data 
      from the different applications in one database with one standard 
      structure.  This would allow easier evaluation and querying.  Once 
      a suspicious pattern has been found in the audit log repository, 
      investigation might proceed with more detail in the application 
      specific audit log.  The presence of a common repository also 
      simplifies and streamlines the implementation of policies for 
      audit data storage, integrity, retention, and destruction. 
    
4. Trigger Events 
    
   The following identifies trigger events for generating audit 
   messages.  These should be viewed as application-level events.  For 
   those events arising in the security infrastructure the "minimal" and 
   "basic" level of auditing as outlined in the Common Criteria[7] 
   should be used as a reference standard.   
    
4.1  Security Administration 
    
   This group includes all actions that create, maintain, query, and 
   display definitions for securing data, functions, and the associated 
   access policies.  For each trigger type, the creation, update or 
   amendment, deletion, and activation or deactivation are auditable. 
 
4.1.1 Data Definition 
    
   This includes creation, modification, deletion, query, and display of 
   security attributes for data sets, data groups, or classes plus their 
   atomic data elements or attributes. 
 
4.1.2 Function Definition 
    
   This includes, for example, creation, modification, deletion, query, 
   or display of security attributes and auditable events for the 
   application functions used for patient management, clinical 
   processes, registry of business objects and methods, program creation 
   and maintenance, etc.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

 
4.1.3 Domain Definition 
    
   This includes all activities to create, modify, delete, query, or 
   display security domains according to various organizational 
   categories such as entity-wide, institutional, departmental, etc.: 
 
4.1.4 Classification Definition 
    
   This includes all activities that create, modify, delete, query or 
   display security categories or groupings for functions and data such 
   as patient management, nursing, clinical, etc. 
 
4.1.5 Permission Definition 
 
   This includes all activities that create, modify, delete, query or 
   display the allowable access permissions associated with functions 
   and data, such as create, read, update, delete, and execution of 
   specific functional units or object access or manipulation methods. 
 
4.1.6 Role Definition 
    
   This includes all activities that create, modify, delete, query or 
   display security roles according to various task-grouping categories 
   such as security administration, admissions desk, nurses, physicians, 
   clinical specialists, etc.  It also includes the association of 
   permissions with roles for role-based access control. 
 
4.1.7 User Definition 
    
   This includes all activities that create, modify, delete, query, or 
   display user accounts.  It includes password or other authentication 
   data.  It also includes the association of roles with users for role-
   based access control, or permissions with users for user-based access 
   control.   
    
4.2  Audit Administration and Data Access 
    
   This category includes all actions that determine the collection and 
   availability of audit data.   
    
4.2.1 Auditable Event Enable or Disable 
    
   This reflects a basic policy decision that an event should or should 
   not be audited.  Some, but not necessarily all, triggers or use cases 
   must create an audit record.  The selection of what to audit depends 
   on administrative policy decisions.  Note that, for integrity, this 
   event should always be audited.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

4.2.2 Audit Data Access 
    
   This includes instances where audit data is viewed or reported for 
   any purpose.  Since the audit data itself may include data protected 
   by institutional privacy policies and expose the implementation of 
   those policies, access to the data is highly sensitive.  This event 
   should therefore always be audited. 
 
4.2.3 Audit Data Modify or Delete 
    
   This includes instances where audit data is modified or deleted.  
   While such operations are sometimes permitted by systems policies, 
   modification or destruction of audit data may well be the result of 
   unauthorized hostile systems access.  Therefore, this type of event 
   should always be audited. 
    
4.3  User Access 
    
   This category includes events of access to secured data and functions 
   for which audit data might be collected.   
    
4.3.1 Sign-On 
    
   This includes successful and unsuccessful attempts from human users 
   and automated system. 
 
4.3.2 Sign-Off 
    
   This includes explicit sign-off events and session abandonment 
   timeouts from human users and automated systems. 
 
4.3.3 Function Access 
    
   This includes user invocation of application or system functions that 
   have permission definitions associated with them.  Note that in a 
   Discretionary Access Control environment not all functions require 
   permissions, especially if their impact is benign in relation to 
   security policies. 
     
   The following are non-normative examples of trigger events relevant 
   to healthcare privacy.  The actual triggers for institutional data 
   access, policies for non-care functions, and support regulatory 
   requirements need to be identified by application-domain standards 
   developers and system implementers. 
 
4.3.3.1 Subject of Care Record Access 
    
   This includes all functions which manipulate basic patient data: 
    
   -  Create, e.g., demographics or patient profile

   -  Import/export of data  from/to an external source, including 
      printing and creation of portable media copies. 
   -  Delete, e.g., invalid creation of care record 
    
4.3.3.2 Encounter or Visit  
    
   This includes all functions which associate a subject of care with an 
   instance of care: 
    
   -  Create, e.g., demographics or patient profile 
   -  Assign encounter identifier 
   -  Per-admit 
   -  Admit 
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Delete, e.g., invalid creation of encounter record, breakdown of 
      equipment, patient did not arrive as expected 
    
4.3.3.3 Care Protocols 
    
   This includes all functions which associate care plans or similar 
   protocols with an instance or subject of care: 
    
   -  Schedule, initiate 
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Complete 
   -  Cancel 
    
4.3.3.4 Episodes or Problems 
 
   This includes specific clinical episodes within an instance of care. 
   Initiate 
    
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Resolve, complete 
   -  Cancel 
    
4.3.3.5 Orders and Order Sets 
    
   This includes clinical or supplies orders within an instance or 
   episode of care. 
    
   -  Initiate 
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Check for contraindications 
   -  Verify 
   -  Deliver/complete - including instructions

   This includes all medication orders and administration within an 
   instance or episode of care.   
    
   -  Order 
   -  Check  
   -  Check for interactions  
   -  Verify 
   -  Dispense/deliver - including administration instructions 
   -  Administer 
   -  Cancel 
    
4.3.3.8 Staff/Participant Assignment 
    
   This includes staffing or participant assignment actions relevant to 
   an instance or episode of care. 
    
   -  Assignment of healthcare professionals, caregivers attending 
      physician, residents, medical students, consultants, etc. 
   -  Change in assigned role or authorization, e.g., relative to 
      healthcare status change. 
   -  De-assignment 
      
5. Data Definitions 
    
   This section defines and describes the data in the XML schema.  The 
   actual XML schema definition is in section 6. 
    
   The proposed data elements are grouped into these categories: 
    
   1) Event Identification - what was done 
   2) Active Participant Identification - by whom 
   3) Network Access Point Identification - initiated from where

5.1  Event Identification 
    
   The following data identify the name, action type, time, and 
   disposition of the audited event.  There is only one set of event 
   identification data per audited event. 
    
5.1.1 Event ID  
    
   Description 
       
      Identifier for a specific audited event, e.g., a menu item, 
      program, rule, policy, function code, or application name, or URL.  
      It identifies the performed function.  
       
   Optionality: Required 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Identifier text string for the function.  This should be an 
      unambiguous code, unique, at least within Audit Source ID.  
      Examples of Event IDs are program name, method name, or function 
      name. 
       
   Rationale 
    
      This field identifies the audited function.  For "Execute" Event 
      Action Code audit records, this identifies the application 
      function performed. 
       
5.1.2 Event Action Code 
    
   Description 
       
      Indicator for type of action performed during the event that 
      generated the audit. 
    
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Enumeration:  
       
         Value Meaning               Examples

                                     Patient Information 
           D   Delete                Delete items, such as a doctor 
                                     master file record 
           E   Execute               Perform a system or application 
                                     function such as logon, program 
                                     execution, or use of an object's 
                                     method 
    
   Rationale 
    
      This broadly indicates what kind of action was done on the 
      Participant Object. 
       
   Notes 
       
      Actions that are not enumerated above are considered an Execute of 
      a specific function or object interface method or treated two or 
      more distinct events.  An application action, such as an 
      authorization, is a function Execute, and the Event ID should 
      identify the function.   
       
      For some applications, such as radiological imaging, a Query 
      action may only determine the presence of data but not access the 
      data itself.  Auditing need not make as fine a distinction. 
       
      Compound actions, such as "Move," should be audited by creating 
      audit data for each operation - read, create, delete - or as an 
      Execute of a function or method. 
       
5.1.3 Event Date/Time 
    
   Description 
       
      Universal coordinated time (UTC), i.e. a date/time specification 
      that is unambiguous as to local time zones.   
    
   Optionality: Required 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      A date/time representation that is unambiguous in conveying 
      universal coordinated time (UTC), formatted according to the ISO 
      8601 standard[8] 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This ties an event to a specific date and time.  Security audits 
      typically require a consistent time base, e.g., UTC, to eliminate 
      time-zone issues arising from geographical distribution.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   Notes 
       
      In a distributed system, some sort of common time base, e.g., an 
      NTP[9]server, is a good implementation tactic.   
 
5.1.4 Event Outcome Indicator  
    
   Description 
       
      Indicates whether the event succeeded or failed. 
    
   Optionality: Required 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      Enumeration: 
    
      Value Meaning 
       ---- ---------------------------------------------------- 
        0   Success 
        4   Minor failure; action restarted, e.g., invalid password 
            with first retry 
        8   Serious failure; action terminated, e.g., invalid 
            password with excess retries 
       12   Major failure; action made unavailable, e.g., user 
            account disabled due to excessive invalid logon attempts 
       
   Rationale 
       
      Some audit events may be qualified by success or failure 
      indicator.  For example, a Logon might have this flag set to a 
      non-zero value to indicate why a logon attempt failed. 
    
5.2  Active Participant Identification 
       
   The following data identify a user for the purpose of documenting 
   personal accountability for the audited event.  Optionally, the 
   user's network access location may be specified.  There may be more 
   than one user per event, e.g., in cases of actions initiated by one 
   user for other users, however only one user may be the 
   initiator/requestor for the event. 
    
5.2.1 User ID 
    
   Description 
    
      Unique identifier for the user performing the event  
       
   Optionality: Required 
    
 
 
Marshall                Expires - October 2003               [Page 14] 
Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   Format / Values 
    
      User identifier text string from the authentication system.  It is 
      a unique value within the Audit Source ID.   
       
   Rationale 
    
      This field ties an audit event to a specific user. 
       
   Notes 
    
      For cross-system audits, especially with long retention, this user 
      identifier should permanently tie an audit event to a specific 
      user via a perpetually unique key. 
         
5.2.2 Alternative User ID 
 
   Description 
    
      Alternative unique identifier for the user performing the event. 
       
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      User identifier text string from authentication system.  This 
      identifier should be one known to a common authentication system 
      (e.g., single sign-on), if available. 
         
   Rationale 
    
      In some situations a user may authenticate with one identity but, 
      to access a specific application system, may use a synonymous 
      identify.  For example, some "single sign on" implementations will 
      do this.  The alternative identifier would then be the original 
      identify used for authentication, and the User ID is the one known 
      to and used by the application.        
 
5.2.3 User Name 
 
   Description 
       
      The human-meaningful name for the user 
       
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      Text string

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   Rationale 
    
      The User ID and Alternative User ID may be internal or otherwise 
      obscure values.  This field assists the auditor in identifying the 
      actual user.  
 
 
5.2.4 User Is Requestor 
    
   Description 
    
      Indicator that the user is or is not the requestor-actor for the 
      audit event. 
       
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      Boolean, default/assumed value is "true" 
       
   Rationale 
    
      This value is used to distinguish between requestor-users and 
      recipient-users.  For example, one person may request a report-
      output to be sent to a another user. 
       
5.2.5 Role ID Code 
    
   Description 
    
      Specification of the role(s) the user plays when performing the 
      event, as assigned in role-based access control security 
    
   Optionality: Optional; multi-valued 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      Multi-valued. 
       
      Coded value, with attribute "code" valued with the role code or 
      text from authorization system.   
       
      The codes may be implementation-defined or reference a standard 
      vocabulary enumeration.  For references to standards the XML 
      schema defines these optional attribute values: 
       
         Attribute      Value description 
         -------------- --------------------------------------------  
         CodeSystem     OID reference

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

         DisplayName    The value to be used in displays and reports 
         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code 
       
   Rationale 
    
      This value ties an audited event to a user's role(s).  It is an 
      optional value that might be used to group events for analysis by 
      user functional role categories. 
       
   Notes 
    
      Many security systems are unable to produce this data, hence it is 
      optional.   
       
      For the common message, this identifier should be the one known to 
      a common authorization system, if available.  Otherwise, it is a 
      unique value within the Audit Source ID.  Consider using a 
      globally unique identifier associated with the role to avoid 
      ambiguity in auditing data collected from multiple systems. 
       
      Role ID is not a substitute for personal accountability.   
       
      Ambiguities arise from composite roles and users with multiple 
      roles, i.e., which role within a composite is being used or what 
      privilege was a user employing?   
       
5.3  Network Access Point Identification 
    
   The network access point identifies the logical network location for 
   application activity.  These data are paired 1:1 with the Active 
   Participant Identification data.  
    
5.3.1 Network Access Point Type Code 
 
   Description 
    
      An identifier for the type of network access point that originated 
      the audit event.   
       
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      Enumeration: 
       
         Value Meaning 
         ----- -------------------------------- 
           1   Machine Name, including DNS name 
           2   IP Address 
           3   Telephone Number

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

    
   Rationale 
    
      This datum identifies the type of network access point identifier 
      of the user device for the audit event.  It is an optional value 
      that may be used to group events recorded on separate servers for 
      analysis of access according to a network access point's type. 
       
5.3.2 Network Access Point ID 
    
   Description 
       
      An identifier for the network access point of the user device for 
      the audit event.  This could be a device id, IP address, or some 
      other identifier associated with a device. 
    
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Text may be constrained to only valid values for the given Network 
      Access Point Type, if specified.  Recommendation is to be as 
      specific as possible where multiple options are available.   
    
   Rationale 
    
      This datum identifies the user's network access point, which may 
      be distinct from the server that performed the action.  It is an 
      optional value that may be used to group events recorded on 
      separate servers for analysis of a specific network access point's 
      data access across all servers. 
    
   Note  
       
      Network Access Point ID is not a substitute for personal 
      accountability.  Internet IP addresses, in particular, are highly 
      volatile and may be assigned to more than one person in a short 
      time period. 
    
   Examples 
       
      Network Access Point ID: SMH4WC02 
      Network Access Point Type: 1 = Machine Name 
       
      Network Access Point ID: 10.10.203.42 
      Network Access Point Type: 2 = IP address  
       
      Network Access Point ID: 610-555-1212 
      Network Access Point Type: 3   = Phone Number

5.4  Audit Source Identification 
    
   The following data are required primarily for application systems and 
   processes.  Since multi-tier, distributed, or composite applications 
   make source identification ambiguous, this collection of fields may 
   repeat for each server or process actively involved in the event.  
   For example, multiple value-sets can identify participating web 
   servers, application processes, and database server threads in an n-
   tier distributed application. Passive event participants, e.g., low-
   level network transports, need not be identified. 
    
5.4.1 Audit Enterprise Site ID 
    
   Description 
       
      Logical source location within the healthcare enterprise network, 
      e.g., a hospital or other provider location within a multi-entity  
      provider group. 
       
      This is defined by the application that generates the audit 
      record.  It contains a unique code that identifies a business 
      organization (owner of data) that is known to the enterprise.  The 
      value further qualifies [disambiguates] the Audit Source ID.  
      Values may vary depending on type of business.  There may be 
      levels of differentiation within the organization. 
    
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Unique identifier text string within the healthcare enterprise.  
      Null value when the system is uniquely identified by Audit Source 
      ID. 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This value differentiates among the sites in a multi-site 
      enterprise health information system.  
       
5.4.2 Audit Source ID 
    
   Description 
       
      Identifier of the source where the event originated. 
    
   Optionality: Required 
    



 
 
Marshall                Expires - October 2003               [Page 19] 
Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   Format / Values 
       
      Unique identifier text string, at least within the Audit 
      Enterprise Site ID 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This field ties the event to a specific source system.  It may be 
      used to group events for analysis according to where the event 
      occurred. 
    
   Notes 
    
      In some configurations, a load-balancing function distributes work 
      among two or more duplicate servers.  The values defined for this 
      field thus may be considered as an source identifier for a group 
      of servers rather than a specific source system. 
       
5.4.3 Audit Source Type Code 
    
   Description 
       
      Code specifying the type of source where event originated. 
    
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Enumeration: 
       
         Value  Meaning

           8    External source, unknown type 
      
   Rationale 
       
      This field indicates which type of source is identified by the 
      Audit Source ID.  It is an optional value that may be used to 
      group events for analysis according to the type of source where 
      the event occurred.

5.5  Participant Object Identification 
      
   The following data assist the auditing process by indicating specific 
   instances of data or objects that have been accessed. 
      
   These data are required unless the values for Event Identification, 
   Active Participant Identification, and Audit Source Identification 
   are sufficient to document the entire auditable event.  Production of 
   audit records containing these data may be enabled or suppressed, as 
   determined by healthcare organization policy and regulatory 
   requirements.  
    
   Because events may have more than one participant, this group should 
   be considered a repeating set of values.  For example, depending on 
   institutional policies and implementation choices: 
    
   -  Two participant object value-sets can be used to identify access 
      to patient data by medical record number plus the specific health 
      care encounter or episode for the patient.   
   -  A patient participant and his authorized representative may be 
      identified concurrently. 
   -  An attending physician and consulting referrals may be identified 
      concurrently. 
   -  All patients identified on a worklist may be identified.  
    
5.5.1 Participant Object Type Code 
    
   Description 
       
      Code for the participant object type being audited.  This value is 
      distinct from the user's role or any user relationship to the 
      participant object.

   Rationale 
       
      To describe the object being acted upon. In addition to queries on 
      the subject of the action in an auditable event, it is also 
      important to be able to query on the type of object for  that 
      action.

          24   Query                2 - System Object 
           
      A "Security Resource" is an abstract securable object, e.g., a 
      screen, interface, document, program, etc. 
    
   Rationale 
       
      For some detailed audit analysis it may be necessary to indicate a 
      more granular type of participant, based on the application role 
      it serves. 
    
5.5.3 Participant Object Data Life Cycle 
    
   Description 
       
      Identifier for the data life-cycle stage for the participant 
      object.  This can be used to provide an audit trail for data, over 
      time, as it passes through the system 
    
   Optionality: Optional

          10   Receipt 
          11   Archiving 
          12   Destruction  
    
   Rationale 
       
      Institutional policies for privacy and security may optionally 
      fall under different accountability rules based on data life 
      cycle.  This provides a differentiating value for those cases.

      Describes the identifier that is contained in Participant Object 
      ID. 
    
   Optionality: Required 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Coded-value enumeration, specific to Participant Object Type Code, 
      using attribute-name "code":

          11  URI                    2 - System Object       
    
      User Identifier and URI[10] text strings are intended to be used 
      for security administration trigger events to identify the objects 
      being acted-upon.  
       
      The codes may be implementation-defined or reference a standard 
      vocabulary enumeration, such as HL7 version 2.4 table 207.  For 
      references to standards, the XML schema defines these optional 
      attribute values:

         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code 
    
   Rationale 
       
      Required to distinguish among various identifiers that may 
      synonymously identify a participant object.

5.5.5 Participant Object ID Sensitivity 
    
   Description 
       
      Denotes policy-defined sensitivities for the Participant Object ID 
      such as VIP, HIV status, mental health status, or similar topics. 
    
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Values are institution and implementation defined text strings. 
       
5.5.6 Participant Object ID 
    
   Description 
    
      Identifies a specific instance of the participant object 
    
   Optionality: Required 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Text string.  Value format depends on Participant Object Type Code 
      and the Participant Object ID Type Code. 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This field identifies a specific instance of an object, such as a 
      patient, to detect/track privacy and security issues. 
    
   Notes 
       
      Consider this to be the primary unique identifier key for the 
      object, so it may be a composite data field as implemented. 
       
5.5.7 Participant Object Name 
    
   Description 
       
      An instance-specific descriptor of the Participant Object ID 
      audited, such as a person's name 
    
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Text string

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message             April 2003 

   Rationale 
       
      This field may be used in a query/report to identify audit events 
      for a specific person, especially if multiple synonymous 
      Participant Object IDs have been used for that person. 
       
5.5.8 Participant Object Query  
    
   Description 
       
      The actual query for a query-type participant object. 
    
   Optionality: Optional 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Base 64 encoded data 
    
   Rationale 
    
      For query events it may be necessary to capture the actual query 
      input to the query process in order to identify the specific 
      event.  Because of differences among query implementations and 
      data encoding for them, this is a base 64 encoded data blob. It 
      may be subsequently decoded or interpreted by downstream audit 
      analysis processing. 
       
5.5.9 Participant Object Detail 
       
   Description 
    
      Implementation-defined data about specific details of the object 
      accessed or used  
       
   Optionality: Optional 
       
   Format 
    
      Base 64 encoded data, multivalued 
       
   Rationale 
    
      If needed, specific details or values from the object accessed can 
      be recorded in an audit trail. In contrast to Participant Object 
      Query String, concrete data values may be of interest versus the 
      mechanism who they were obtained. Because of differences among  
      implementations and data encoding, this is a base 64 encoded data 
      blob. It may be subsequently decoded or interpreted by downstream 
      audit analysis processing.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   Audit data must be secured at least to the same extent as the 
   underlying data and activities being audited.  This includes access 
   controls as well as data integrity and recovery functions.  This 
   document acknowledges the need for, but does not specify, the 
   policies and technical methods to accomplish this. 
    
   It is conceivable that audit data might have unintended uses, e.g., 
   tracking the frequency and nature of system use for productivity 
   measures.  ASTM standard E2147-01[5] states, in paragraph 5.3.10, 
   "Prohibit use for other reasons than to enforce security and to 
   detect security breaches in record health information systems, for 
   example, the audits are not to be used to explore activity profiles 
   or movement profiles of employees."
