Implicit IV for Counter-based Ciphers in Encapsulating Security Payload
                                 (ESP)
                   draft-ietf-ipsecme-implicit-iv-11

Abstract

   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector
   (IV) in each packet.  The size of IV depends on the applied
   transform, being usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined by
   the time this document is written.  Some algorithms such as AES-GCM,
   AES-CCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 when used with IPsec, take the IV to
   generate a nonce that is used as an input parameter for encrypting
   and decrypting.  This IV must be unique but can be predictable.  As a
   result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence Number (SN) can be
   used instead to generate the nonce.  This avoids sending the IV
   itself, and saves in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM and
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 8 octets per packet.  This document describes how
   to do this.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described BCP 14
   [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   Counter-based AES modes of operation such as AES-CCM ([RFC4309]), and
   AES-GCM ([RFC4106]) require the specification of an nonce for each
   ESP packet.  The same applies for ChaCha20-Poly1305 ([RFC7634]).
   Currently this nonce is generated thanks to the Initialization Vector
   (IV) provided in each ESP packet ([RFC4303]).  This practice is
   designated in this document as "explicit IV".

Internet-Draft             Implicit IV in ESP               October 2019


   In some contexts, such as IoT, it may be preferable to avoid carrying
   the extra bytes associated to the IV and instead generate it locally
   on each peer.  The local generation of the IV is designated in this
   document as "implicit IV".

   The size of this IV depends on the specific algorithm, but all of the
   algorithms mentioned above take an 8-octet IV.

   This document defines how to compute the IV locally when it is
   implicit.  It also specifies how peers agree with the Internet Key
   Exchange version 2 (IKEv2 - [RFC7296]) on using an implicit IV versus
   an explicit IV.

   This document limits its scope to the algorithms mentioned above.
   Other algorithms with similar properties may later be defined to use
   similar mechanisms.

   This document does not consider AES-CBC ([RFC3602]) as AES-CBC
   requires the IV to be unpredictable.  Deriving it directly from the
   packet counter as described below is insecure as mentioned in
   Security Consideration of [RFC3602] and has led to real world chosen
   plain-text attack such as BEAST [BEAST].

   This document does not consider AES-CTR [RFC3686] as it focuses on
   the recommended AEAD suites provided in [RFC8221].

3.  Terminology

   o  IoT: Internet of Things.

   o  IV: Initialization Vector.

   o  IIV: Implicit Initialization Vector.

   o  Nonce: a fixed-size octet string used only once.  In our case, the
      nonce takes the IV as input and is provided as an input parameter
      for encryption/decryption.

4.  Implicit IV

   With the algorithms listed in Section 2, the 8-byte IV MUST NOT
   repeat for a given key.  The binding between an ESP packet and its IV
   is provided using the Sequence Number or the Extended Sequence
   Number.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 represent the IV with a regular 4-byte
   Sequence Number and with an 8-byte Extended Sequence Number
   respectively.

   This document solely defines the IV generation of the algorithms
   defined in [RFC4106] for AES-GCM, [RFC4309] for AES-CCM and [RFC7634]
   for ChaCha20-Poly1305.  All other aspects and parameters of those
   algorithms are unchanged, and are used as defined in their respective
   specifications.

5.  IKEv2 Initiator Behavior

   An initiator supporting this feature SHOULD propose implicit IV (IIV)
   algorithms in the Transform Type 1 (Encryption Algorithm)
   Substructure of the Proposal Substructure inside the Security
   Association Payload (SA Payload) in the IKEv2 Exchange.  To
   facilitate backward compatibility with non-supporting peers the
   initiator SHOULD also include those same algorithms with explicit IV
   as separate transforms.

Internet-Draft             Implicit IV in ESP               October 2019


6.  IKEv2 Responder Behavior

   The rules of SA Payload processing require that responder picks its
   algorithms from the proposal sent by the initiator, thus this will
   ensure that the responder will never send an SA payload containing
   the IIV transform to an initiator that did not propose it.

7.  Security Considerations

   Nonce generation for these algorithms has not been explicitly
   defined.  It has been left to the implementation as long as certain
   security requirements are met.  Typically, for AES-GCM, AES-CCM and
   ChaCha20-Poly1305, the IV is not allowed to be repeated for one
   particular key.  This document provides an explicit and normative way
   to generate IVs.  The mechanism described in this document meets the
   IV security requirements of all relevant algorithms.

   As the IV must not repeat for one SA when Counter-Mode ciphers are
   used, implicit IV as described in this document MUST NOT be used in
   setups with the chance that the Sequence Number overlaps for one SA.
   The sender's counter and the receiver's counter MUST be reset (by
   establishing a new SA and thus a new key) prior to the transmission
   of the 2^32nd packet for an SA that uses a non extended Sequence
   Number (respectively the 2^64nd packet for an SA that uses an
   Extended Sequence Number).  This prevents sequence number overlaps
   for the mundane point-to-point case.  Multicast as described in
   [RFC5374], [RFC6407] and [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] is a prominent example,
   where many senders share one secret and thus one SA.  As such,
   Implicit IV may only be used with Multicast if some mechanisms are
   employed that prevent Sequence Number to overlap for one SA,
   otherwise Implicit IV MUST NOT be used with Multicast.

   This document defines three new encryption transforms that use
   implicit IV.  Unlike most encryption transforms defined to date,
   which can be used for both ESP and IKEv2, these transforms are
   defined for ESP only and cannot be used in IKEv2.  The reason is that
   IKEv2 messages don't contain a unique per-message value that can be
   used for IV generation.  The Message-ID field in IKEv2 header is
   similar to the SN field in ESP header, but recent IKEv2 extensions
   ([RFC6311], [RFC7383]) do allow it to repeat, so there is not an easy
   way to derive unique IV from IKEv2 header fields.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has updated the "Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
   Parameters" [RFC7296] by adding new code points to the "Transform
   Type Values"/"Transform Type 1 - Encryption Algorithm Transform IDs"
   registry [IANA]:
