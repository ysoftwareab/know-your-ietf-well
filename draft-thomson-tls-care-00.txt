                       draft-thomson-tls-care-00

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) that allows a client to indicate that
   it wants to provide a client certificate.

1.  Introduction

   In Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] and Datagram TLS (DTLS)
   [RFC5764] the server decides whether or not to request a certificate
   from clients.

   In TLS versions 1.2 and earlier, the Certificate message from a
   client is not encrypted and is therefore not confidential.  TLS
   renegotiation is frequently used to provide confidentiality for
   client credentials, since renegotiation handshakes are encrypted with
   the TLS session keys.

   A client that is aware of a need to authenticate can initial
   renegotiation, but is unable to induce a CertificateRequest from the
   server.  The decision to request client authentication is one that
   can only be made by a server.

   This document defines a client authentication request extension that
   can be used by a client to request that the server send a
   CertificateRequest in its handshake.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   At times, this document falls back on shorthands for establishing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  These terms are defined in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Client Authentication and TLS Renegotiation

   Renegotiation has the potential to create confusion at higher layers
   about the security properties that apply to the byte stream.  This is
   especially difficult when there are protocol constructs that span the
   ChangeCipherSpec messages that represent a switch between states.

   For that reason, a client can initiate a new connection when it
   detects a need to authenticate, initiating renegotiation to establish
   authentication credentials immediately after the initial handshake.

   Since the server only conditionally requests client authentication
   and it has no context with which to decide that authentication is
   needed, the client needs to provide some indication that it might
   need to be authentication.  The second, renegotiation handshake can
   contain the client authentication request extension (Section 3) to
   provide this indication.  As long as no application data is sent on
   the connection prior to completing renegotiation and sending the
   corresponding ChangeCipherSpec, there is no possibility for confusion
   over the security properties of application content.

   This behavior could need to be triggered by a higher level protocol.
   This document does not define how that happens.

3.  Client Authentication Request Extension

   A new extension type ("client_authentication_request(TBD)") is
   defined.  If a client includes this extension in its ClientHello to
   indicate that it wishes the server to issue a CertificateRequest.

   enum {
       client_authentication_request(TBD), (65535)
   } ExtensionType;

   The "extension_data" field of this extension MUST be empty.

   A server that supports client authentication based on certificates
   can use the presence of this extension to decide to include a
   CertificateRequest.  The server MAY choose to ignore this extension.

   A server MUST NOT send this extension to a client.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document is entirely about security.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated a TLS extension code point of (TBD) for this
   extension.
