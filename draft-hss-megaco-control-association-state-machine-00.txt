Abstract
   
   This document captures the description and interpretation of all the
   functional  procedures  and  the  related  procedural  parameters,
   pertaining to MG-MGC control association, as described in the MEGACO
   protocol.
   
   It suggests the various states, the MG and MGC state machines goes
   through, during the life cycle of such an association. It goes on to

1. Scope
   
   This document puts into words, the interpretation the authors have,
   after studying the MEGACO RFC, Implementation Guides and discussions
   in the MEGACO mailing list, Annex L and the manner in which the
   control association state machine of MG and MGC work while executing
   the respective control association procedures.
   
   There is still a certain amount of lack of clarity regarding the
   topic of control associations in MEGACO perspective as a whole. So
   to help arrive at some kind of conclusion, the authors have made
   some  assumptions  about  these  unclear  aspects  of  the  protocol.
   Changes in these assumptions may affect the overall interpretation
   of this topic. Nevertheless the authors have tried their utmost to
   preserve the existing description of the protocol. The authors have
   also taken into account various converging assumptions, which were
   discussed, extensively on the mailing list.

5. Control Association Overview
   
   A control association can be defined as the logical session between
   two key entities of the decomposed gateway architecture viz., MG and
   MGC. MEGACO protocol has defined a set of control association
   procedures between these two entities to achieve the distributed
   call control functionality. The control association functionality
   has been visualized as a disjoint set of procedures independent of
   the  call  processing/management  activity.  However  any  change
   (permanent or transient) in the state of the control association
   between MG and MGC may or may not affect the call-related aspects
   both at MG and MGC.

6. Assumptions
   
(1) Peer Entities shall be identified based on the MID field in the
    message header field of the protocol message.
   
(2) Primary and secondary MGCs may be supporting different versions and
    gateway service profiles.
   
(3) Service  Change  command  with  method  as  ôRESTARTö  on  ROOT
    terminations indicates that all terminations are in service, by
    default.
   
(4) Synchronization between redundant MGs and that between redundant
    MGCs is outside the scope of the MEGACO protocol.
   
(5) Since the Mid should not change during the course of the control
    association, MGs running in redundant configuration must have same
    MIDs.
    
   Vikas, Vivek, Shiv, Prashant                                      5
   
   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
   
(6) MGCs running in redundant configuration may or may not have same
    MIDs.
   
(7) Secondary MGCs being provisioned at MG may or may not be running in
    the redundant configuration.
   
(8)   ôService  Change  Reasonö  parameter  can  be  understood  as  the
    qualifier to the information that the ômethod field conveys while
    indicating  the  change  in  the  control  association  through  the
    service change command.
   
(9) The ôService Change Addressö and ôMGCIdToTryö parameters are only
    applicable on ROOT termination. When sent in a service change
    command  would  convey  the  transport  address  to  which  future
    communication should be made.
   
(10) A MG is pre-provisioned by a management mechanism outside the
    scope of this protocol with a Primary and (optionally) an ordered
    list of Secondary MGCs.
   
   The  pre-provisioning  of  MGCs  at  MG  reveals  all  the  transport
   parameters of the specified MGCs, at which MG would initially try to
   create the logical session with one of them. The MIDs of the
   respective  MGCs  may  or  may  not  be  configured  along  with  the
   transport parameters.
   
   However, MGC need not be provisioned with the list of MGs, from
   which the control associationsÆ request can be received during the
   start up phase. The controlled MGs would be identified by their
   MIDs, retrieved from the first service change command being received
   from each of them. The MID of the respective MGs must not change
   during the life cycle of the control association.

7. Definitions related to Control Association
   
   The terms mentioned below are important and are to be kept in mind
   while reading the document. These should be referred to as and when
   required.
   
  A. Cold Start: It is defined as the fresh start of the Media Gateway.
     All the terminations would be assumed to be in-service by default.
     All the terminations would be present in the NULL context. In
     other words, no active calls would be running over any of the
     associated  terminations  present  in  the  specified  control
     association.
   
   B. Planned Switchover: It is defined as a planned activity being
     initiated either by MG or MGC application or the NM entity, which
     triggers the generation of Service Change command from the entity
     which is going out-of-service and informs about the switchover to
     a redundant entity.
   
   C. Transparent Switchover: It is defined as an activity wherein the
     MGC or MG does not come to know about the redundant takeover that
     happened on the other entity involved in the control association,
     as the transport parameters of the affected entity (MG or MGC)
     have been retained.
   
   D. Unplanned Switchover: It is defined as an unplanned activity
     occurring at MG, which caused it to go abruptly out-of-service.
     Moreover due this activity, redundant MG has taken over the
     control and it sends the Service Change command. Here there would
     not be any protocol message that was generated from the MG that
     went down.
   
   E. Warm Redundancy: It is defined as the switchover operation from an
     active to a standby entity, wherein all the existing calls on the
     failed entity have been lost, although a new entity (standby) has
     taken over the control association. Both MG and MGC can have this
     kind of implementation.
   
   F. Hot Redundancy: It is defined as the switchover operation between
     an active and a standby entity, wherein all the existing calls
     have survived over the standby one, even though the new entity
     (standby) has taken over the control association. All the call
     states were preserved. Both MG and MGC can have this kind of
     implementation.
   
   G. Cold Boot: It is defined as the boot operation in which MG was
     able to preserve the statically provisioned data by NM as well as

                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
     the dynamic configuration data provided in NULL context by MGC,
     however all the active contexts or calls were lost due to some
     internal failure.
   
   H. Warm Boot: It is defined as the boot operation in which MG was
     able to preserve the static provisioned data by NM as well as the
     dynamic configuration data provided by MGC in NULL context.
   
     In Warm Boot, all the active contexts or calls were survived at
     the MG, however some of the transient transactions are lost.
   
   I. Message Identifier (MID): This field is an identifier (either the
     transport address or just a logical identifier) that reveals the
     identity of the entity, which is originating the protocol message.
     It is the mandatory part of the every protocol message that is
     exchanged between MG and MGC.
   
   
8. The Service Change Command
   
   MEGACO protocol defines all the control association procedures using
   a Service Change command on ROOT termination. Each such command
   would encapsulate a set of control parameters that would be utilized
   while executing the related procedures. A service change command on
   ROOT governs the change in the state of the control association in
   terms of the change in either the communication status between MG-
   MGC or the change in the existing call states.
   
   It is worth noting that a Service Change with termination ID as ALL
   or ô*ö just means that terminations in the originating entity have
   undergone a state change in the ôservice-stateö. This may impact the
   existing calls that are active over the specified terminations.
   However there is no change in the state of the control association.
   
   The control parameters pertaining to a service change command are
   listed below.
   
   A. Service Change Method.
   B. Service Change Reason.
   C. Service Change Profile.
   D. Service Change Version.
   E. Service Change Address.
   F. Service Change MGCIdToTry.
   G. Service Change Delay.
   H. Service Change Timestamp.
   
    
   Vikas, Vivek, Shiv, Prashant                                      8
   
   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
   Of all the above parameters, the ôservice change methodö is the main
   attribute that primarily dictates the behavioral change in the state
   of a control association. The other parameters, which are the part
   of the service change command, help the remote entity to execute the
   relevant  protocol-defined  procedures  with  respect  to  the  state
   change in the control association. For instance, in case of command
   issued with ôDISCONNECTEDö method from MG, it is conveyed to MGC
   that the MG was temporarily disconnected with MGC. Here MGC may
   infer that there may be some synchronization problem between the two
   and an AUDIT command may be issued.
   
   The ôservice change reasonö, if specified, should be looked into to
   determine the severity of change in the states of the calls being
   realized by MG and then act accordingly.
   
   The ôservice change timestampö, if specified, conveys the exact time
   when the service change command was issued. This would help the
   receiving entity in making decisions irrespective of the transport
   delay.
   
   
  8.1. Usage of Service Change Method
   
   The ôService Change Methodö parameter on ROOT specifies the change
   in the control association between MG and MGC. The change in service
   may be because of either of the following functional changes.
   
   Note that the Service Change Reason conveys the gravity of the
   change in call states, as and when required.
   
   These two aspects can be understood more clearly as one goes through
   the interpretation of different methods defined in the protocol.
   
   a. Graceful:
   
      1. This method can only be sent from MG to MGC. It indicates that
        the MG will be taken out of service after the specified Service
        Change Delay.
   
      2. The  established  connections  or  calls  over  the  individual
        terminations are not yet affected.
   
      3. After the specified delay, all the calls would be terminated
        abruptly, and all the terminations would be moved into the null
    
   Vikas, Vivek, Shiv, Prashant                                      9
   
   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
        context at MG.  The controlling MGC will not send any SUBTRACT
        command to MG and clear all the call contexts at its end.
   
      4. The ôgracefulö with delay NULL means that MG would terminate
        the  control  association  AFTER  all  the  call  contexts  are
        cleared.
   
      5. In either of the above cases, the MGC should refrain from
        establishing new calls during the course of the graceful
        shutdown and should try to clear the existing call contexts
        gracefully.
   
   b. Forced:
   
      1. This method can either be sent from MG to MGC or vice versa.
   
      2. It indicates that the originating entity (MG/MGC) was taken
         abruptly out of service and any established connections or
         calls active over the  associated  terminations  were  lost,
         consequently all the terminations at its end were moved to
         null context.
   
      3. The receiving entity (MGC/MG) is responsible for cleaning up
         the call contexts at its end.
   
   c. Restart:
   
      1. This method can be sent from MG to MGC or vice versa.
   
      When sent from the MG to the MGC,
   
      2. At COLD start, it indicates that the MG has already come into
        service afresh. All the terminations are assumed to be in
        service.
   
      3. If non-zero delay is specified, it signifies that although the
        MG is capable of communicating with the controlling MGC, the
        service or the call-carrying capability would be restored on
        the physical terminations, associated with ôROOTö termination,
        AFTER the specified delay.
   
      When sent from the MGC to the MG,
   
      4. It indicates the MGC wants MG to restart.

   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
   
      5. If non-zero delay is specified, it signifies that the service
        or the call-carrying capability would be restored on the
        physical  terminations,  associated  with  ôROOTö  termination,
        AFTER the specified delay.
   
      6. In case of warm boot or cold boot, it indicates change in the
        protocol version supported by the remote. In this case, the
        already existing calls at MG may or may not be retained.
   
   d. Disconnected:
   
      1. This method can only be sent from MG to MGC.
   
      2. This method indicates that the MG lost communication with the
        controlling MGC either because of its transient failure, which
        was  subsequently  restored  or  MG  detects  failure  of  its
        controlling MGC and tries to contact it again.
   
      3. The transient failure may be because of:
   
        - Failures of the underlying transport or there was some change
          in the transport parameters of MG.
   
        - If there is some call-state loss at MG.
   
        - Switchover (either planned or unplanned) to standby MG. Here
          the standby MG generates this method.
   
      4. In either of the above scenarios, the MGC may audit the MG to
        synchronize its state.
   
   e. Handoff:
   
      1. This method can either be sent from MG to MGC or vice versa.
   
      When sent from the MGC to the MG,
   
      2. This method indicates that the MGC is going out of service and
        a control association must be established with the new MGC.
   
      However sent from the MG to the MGC,
   
    
   Vikas, Vivek, Shiv, Prashant                                     11
   
   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
      3. This indicates that the MG is attempting to establish a new
        control association in accordance with a Handoff received from
        the MGC with which it was previously associated.
   
      4. The  above  operation  should  be  transparent  to  the  MG
        application.
   
      5. In this case, MGC must audit the requesting MG to resynchronize
        its state, in the absence of which MG assumes that MGC has
        failed and start trying secondary ones.
   
   f. Failover:
   
      1. This method can only be sent from MG to MGC.
   
      2. When sent from the MG, which is going down, this method
        indicate the primary MG is out of service and a secondary MG
        would be taking over.
   
      3. Otherwise, this method reveals that MG detects the failure of
        its controlling MGC and is now trying the secondary MGC to re-
        establish the control association.
   
      4. In either of the above cases, the already existing calls at MG
        may or may not be retained.

9. Overview of Protocol Control Association Procedures
   
   As already mentioned, protocol has defined a set of procedures to
   address the various aspects of control association between MG and
   MGC. Apart from this, some guidelines have been laid for initial
   provisioning  of  MG  before  the  actual  control  association  is
   established between MG and MGC.
   
   All the control association procedures that have been discussed in
   the protocol cater to a set of scenarios. Hence the relevant
   procedures have been categorized into different phases, depending on
   the behavioral changes the control association undergoes during its
   life cycle, for all the respective scenarios. This categorization
   would form the basis on which the complete state machine design of
   the MG-MGC control association would rely upon.

   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
  9.1. Phases in a Control Association Life Cycle
   
   Further based on whatever protocol has defined, the life cycle of a
   control association can be divided into the following phases.
   
   1. Association Inactive Phase.
   2. Association Restart Phase.
   3. Association Active Phase.
   4. Association Shutdown Phase.
   5. Association Switchover Phase.
   
   1) Inactive Phase: During this phase of operation, both MG and MGC
      would just have the necessary pre-provisioned data (specifically
      the transport parameters) and they are waiting for a trigger from
      the application to initiate the control association related
      procedures.
   
   2) Restart Phase: During this phase of operation, the control
      association between MG and MGC is restarted between the concerned
      MG and the MGC.
   
     The following scenarios and the corresponding procedures can be
     addressed in this phase of operation.
   
     . A control association between the concerned MG and MGC is
        initiated from MG at its Cold start. No calls are present at
        the moment.
   
        Method: RESTART from MG.
        Reason: Cold Boot or Service Restored.
   
     . MG wants to change its protocol version. The calls may or may
        not get affected (call states change would be decided by
        ôService Change Reasonö, if present).
   
        Method: RESTART from MG.
        Reason: Warm Boot, Cold Boot or Service Restored.
   
     . MGC wants to change its protocol version. The calls may or may
        not get affected (call states change would be conveyed to by
        ôService Change Reasonö, if present).
   
        Method: RESTART from MGC.
        Reason: Warm Boot, Cold Boot or Service Restored.
   
    
   Vikas, Vivek, Shiv, Prashant                                     14
   
   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
     . MGC wants to initiate a reboot operation at MG due to its own
        failure  or  in  case  of  version  change  at  its  end.  The
        corresponding service change request from MGC may be generated
        only if the MG was already registered with the former.
   
        Method: RESTART from MGC.
        Reason: Warm Boot, Cold Boot.
   
   3) Active Phase: During this phase of operation, MG-MGC control
      association is alive and normal protocol commands get exchanged
      across the two entities as defined in the protocol. In this phase
      of operation, MG may exchange the control association command
      (service change on ROOT) intending to resynchronize the states of
      the terminations engaged in the association or to convey about
      the future behavior of the control association.
   
      Note that the ôservice change command on ROOTö is not allowed
      from MGC for the state synchronization with the peer. The
      following two possibilities may arise in this phase of operation.
   
     The following control association scenarios and the corresponding
     procedures can be addressed in this phase of operation.
   
     . If there is a transient failure at MG, either due to a problem
        in the underlying transport layer, or there was a transparent
        switchover at MG but it was recovered subsequently.
   
        Method: DISCONNECTED from MG.
        Reason: Cold Boot or Warm Boot.
   
     . If there is going to be a service shutdown at MG after some
        planned duration, MG may initiate a service change command to
        the peer MGC to convey the same information so that the latter
        may act accordingly. However, the existing association is not
        affected at all.
   
        Method: GRACEFUL from MG.
        Reason: None.
   
     . If there is a planned switchover at MG to a standby entity and
        the new entity was realizing either Warm or Hot Redundancy.
   
        Method: DISCONNECTED from MG.
        Reason: Cold Boot or Warm Boot.

                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
   4) Association Switchover Phase: This phase can be visualized as the
      activity involved in bringing the control association back to the
      active phase by switching over to a different entity. This
      switchover to a different remote may occur either implicitly
      (peer failure detection locally) or explicitly (through failure
      notification from remote)
   
     The following control association scenarios and the corresponding
     procedures can be addressed in this phase of operation.
   
     . MGC detects the failure of its controlled MG and it waits for a
        service change request from MG (either it may be active or the
        standby), to re-establish the control association.
   
        Method: MGC expects either RESTART or DISCONNECTED.
        Reason: Cold Boot or Warm Boot.
   
     . MGC receives the failure indication from its controlled MG and
        it waits for a re-registration request from either the active
        or the standby MG afterwards.
   
        From active MG
        Method: FAILOVER.
        Reason: MG Impending Failure.
   
        Subsequently from standby MG
        Method: RESTART or DISCONNECTED.
        Reason: Cold Boot or Warm Boot.
   
     . MG detects the failure of its controlling MGC and it tries the
        secondary  MGCs  in  order,  to  re-establish  the  control
        association.
   
        Method: FAILOVER from MG.
        Reason: MGC Impending Failure.
   
     . MG detects the failure of its controlling MGC and the control
        association is also not established with secondary MGCs and the
        failed one is attempted again.
   
        Method: DISCONNECTED from MG.
        Reason: MGC Impending Failure.
   
    
   Vikas, Vivek, Shiv, Prashant                                     16
   
   INTERNET-DRAFT     MEGACO Control Association
                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
     . MG tries to register with the handed-off MGC as redirected by
        its controlling MGC to re-establish the control association
        with the newly specified MGC.
   
        Method: HANDOFF from MG.
        Reason: MGC Directed Change.
   
   5) Association Shutdown Phase: This phase can be visualized as the
      period during which the originating entity conveys to the remote
      entity (MG or MGC) about its own failure. Additionally, the
      sending entity may indicate that another entity would come up to
      take up the control of the specified association.
   
     The following control association scenarios and the corresponding
     procedures can be addressed in this phase of operation.
   
      - There is a planned switchover activity being initiated at MG
        due to a local failure or for maintenance reasons and the same
        is conveyed to MGC.
   
        Method: FAILOVER from MG.
        Reason: MG Impending Failure.
   
      - There is a planned switchover activity being initiated at MGC
        due to a local failure or for maintenance reasons and the same
        is conveyed to MG.
   
        Method: HANDOFF from MGC.
        Reason: MGC Impending Failure.
   
      - There is a forced shutdown at MG or MGC and the specified
        entity wishes to convey this information to its peer. Both MG
        and MGC would terminate all the active calls at their ends.
   
        Method: FORCED from MGC or MG.
        Reason: None.
   
  9.2. Control Association States Description
   
   The input triggers to the state machine would be extracted from the
   identified scenarios in the above section and the different states
   inside the state machine are determined from the identified phases.

                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
   The states, which have been designed in both MG and MGC state
   machines, maps one-to-one on the phases explained earlier and are
   listed as follows:
   
   1. Restart In Progress.

        Input parameters:
        - Service change delay.
        - Service Change Address.
        - Service Change Version.
        - Service Change Profile.
   
        10.1.1.1. Steps
   
           1) Start the restart avalanche timer.
   
           2) On expiry of the restart avalanche timer, send the service
             change request command with method as RESTART, reason as
             SERVICE RESTORED and the other specified parameters.
   
           3) In addition to the generation of Service Change command,

     10.2.1. Registration Response from Peer
   
        Input parameters: None
   
        10.2.1.1. Steps
   
            1) During the registration, if all the parameters were
              accepted by MGC, it replies back with the successful
              response.
   
              a) If the delay was specified in the service change
                 delay, then the state remains same. On expiry of the
                 restart  delay,  the  state  is  changed  to  AIS
                 (ASSOCIATION IN SERVICE).
   
              b) If  the  delay  was  not  specified,  the  state  is
                 immediately changed to (AIS) ASSOCIATION IN SERVICE.
   
            2) If Service change address present in the service change
               command response from peer, modify the address of the
               MGC to send all the subsequent requests to MGC on the
               newly specified address. Association State in this case
               again depends upon the service change delay parameter
               sent in the request as described in step 1.
   
            3) If the ServiceChangeMgcId is present in the service
               change command response from peer. Then,
   
               a) MG sends the service change command to MGC specified
                 in the ServiceChangeMgcId with the same parameters.
   
               b) This procedure continues till the registration request
                 is accepted by the new MGC.
   
             4) If the Protocol Version is present in the Service change
               response.
   
               a) If MG complies with the version received in the
                  service change response, state changes would be as
                  described in step 1.
   
               b) If the MG is not able to comply with the version
                  received in the service change response, it tries the
                  secondary  MGCs  with  the  same  service  change

                  by any of the configured MGCs.
   
     10.2.2. Forced Shutdown from MG application
   
        Input parameters: None
   
        10.2.2.1. Steps
   
          1) Clear all the call contexts forcefully.
   
          2) Send Service Change command to the controlling MGC with
            method as FORCED.
   
        10.2.2.2. New State
   
            INACTIVE
   
     10.2.3. Graceful Shutdown from MG application
   
        Input parameters:
        - Service Change Delay
   
        10.2.3.1. Steps
   
          1) If the Graceful delay is less than the Restart delay, then
             stop the Restart delay timer, then send the service change
             request to MGC with method as FORCED. The new state
             becomes INACTIVE.
   
          2) If the Graceful delay is more that the Restart delay, send
             the service change request to MGC with method as GRACEFUL
             and delay as specified in the input parameters. The state
             remains unchanged.
   
     10.2.4. Failover at active MG
   
        The MG Failover is not expected in this state. It is assumed
        that since there has been no call-related activity in this
        state.

        If MG detects the Failure of the MGC to which it had sent the
        service change request.
   
        10.2.5.1. Steps
   
            1) Send the service change command to secondary MGCs, with
              the same set of parameters as sent in the initial
              registration message to primary MGC until registration is
              completed.
   
        10.2.5.2. New State
   
            The state remains unchanged.
   
   
     10.2.6. Transport Parameters Change at MG
   
        Input parameters:
        - Service Change Address
   
        10.2.6.1. Steps
   
            1) Send the service change command with method as RESTART
              and the specified Service Change Address.
   
        10.2.6.2. New State
   
            State remains same.
   
   
     10.2.7. Restart from MGC
   
        Input parameters:
        - Service Change Reason
   
        10.2.7.1. Steps
   
            1) Stop the Restart Delay timer if running.
   
            2) Give the indication to the MG application to restart MG,
              along with the received service change reason from MGC.

                     Procedures and State Machine          August 2001
   
            3) Once the restart operation is finished, MG generates the
              registration command to the same controlling MGC.
   
        10.2.7.2. New State
   
            State remains unchanged.
   
     10.2.8. Handoff at current controlling MGC
   
        Input parameters:
        - Service Change MGCIdToTry
   
        This input trigger could be received from MGC if the control is
        transferred to a new MGC.
   
        10.2.8.1. Steps
   
          1) Start the restart avalanche timer to prevent the avalanche
            at MGC.
   
          2) Send the service change request to Handed-off MGC with
            method as HANDOFF and reason as MGC Impending Failure.
   
        10.2.8.2. New State
   
            State remains unchanged.
   
     10.2.9. Forced Shutdown at MGC
   
        This input trigger could be received when the Restart Delay
        timer is running.
   
        10.2.9.1. Steps
   
          1) MG attempts to contact the next MGC on its pre-provisioned
            list.  Implementation  may  start  its  attempts  at  the
            beginning (that was the MGC that failed), or it attempts
            the next remote in the configured list.

     10.2.10.   Protocol message from Peer
   
        Input parameters: None
   
        10.2.10.1.     Steps
   
          1) If before receiving the response from MGC, MG received the
             protocol commands from MGC, it should reply back with the
             error code ôCommand received before restart responseö.
          2) If after receiving the response from MGC, and if the delay
             timer is still running, and during this time a protocol
             command from MGC is received, that command should be Audit
             capability only. For any call related protocol commands

             is being contacted, accepts the registration request.
   
           2) Once the registration is complete, send the service change
             command with GRACEFUL method to the same MGC. If the delay
             was specified in the input, then the delay in the command
             should be the left-out time. New state in this case would
             be AIS (ASSOCIATION_IN_SERVICE).
   
           3) If Handoff/Failover takes more time than the Graceful
             delay period, then the implementation will terminate the
             control association abruptly and all the call contexts

  11.1. RIP (RESTART_IN_PROGRESS)
   
     11.1.1. Cold Start At MG
   
        Input parameters:
        - Service change delay.
        - Service Change Address.
        - Service Change Version.
        - Service Change Profile.
   
        11.1.1.1. Steps:
            1) Examine  the  service  change  version  of  the  received
              message.
   
            2) If the MGC is unable to comply with the suggested version
              then send a Service Change Response to the MG with error
              ô406 Version not supportedö. State remains same.
   
            3) If the MGC supports the suggested or lower version, send
              a Service Change Response to the MG the negotiated
              Service Change Version. Start Delay Timer and the state
              changes to RIP (RESTART_IN_PROGRESS). After Restart Delay
              expiry, state would become ASSOCIATION_IN_SERVICE.
   
            4) If the MGC wishes to handoff the MG to another MGC, send
              a Service Change Response to the MG with Service Change
              MGCIdToTry  [transport address of the new MGC]. State
              remains same
   
              If the MGC wishes to change the Transport Address for
              further correspondence to be used by the MG, send a
              Service Change Response to the MG with Service Change
              Address [containing the new transport address] along with
              the other parameters. Change the state as per bullet 3.
   
     11.1.2. Forced Shutdown At MG
   
        Input parameters: None
   
        11.1.2.1. Steps
            1) Here there should not be any call running at MG.
   
            2) After this, MGC shall wait for the next registration
              request from the MG going down.

        11.1.3.1. Steps
          1) Start the delay timer for value specified in Service change
            delay.
   
          2) Till the expiry of the service change delay, the state of
            MGC control association remains RESTART IN PROGRESS.
   
          3) If MG specifies null delay or the graceful period is
            shorter than the restart period earlier specified in the
            restart delay, the control association would get terminated
            immediately.

     If the registered MG, wants to transfer the control of the
     specified association to the redundant MG.
   
        11.1.4.1. Steps
          1) Simply stop restart delay timer and start waiting for a
             new service change command from the standby MG with method
             as DISCONNECTED and reason as SERVICE RESTORED.

            1) All the call contexts would be cleared at MGC without
              sending SUBTRACT commands to MG.
   
            2) After this, MGC shall wait for the next registration
              request from the MG going down.

          1) Start the delay timer for value specified in Service change
            delay.
   
          2) Till the expiry of the service change delay, the state of
            MG  control  association  becomes  ASSOCIATION  IN  SERVICE
            (AIS).
   
          3) Delete all the call contexts abruptly after the completion
            of the graceful period.
   
          4) If the NULL delay was specified, the control association
            must last for the duration of the time until all the active
            call contexts are cleared from MGC.

              sending SUBTRACT commands to MG.
   
            2) Buffer the Forced shutdown request until the MG sends a
              service  change  request  to  re-establish  the  control
              association.
   
            3) Once the association is re-established, send the service
              change command with FORCED method to the same MG so that
              MG could clear the call contexts at its end.

              service  change  request  to  re-establish  the  control
              association.
   
            2) Once the association is re-established, send the reply to
              the MG with the MGCIdToTry field set to the Handed off
              MGC except the case that the MG is forcefully going down.

            2) If the MGC is unable to comply with the suggested version
              then send a Service Change Response to the MG with error
              ô406 Version not supportedö. State remains same.
   
            3) If the MGC supports the suggested or lower version, send
              a Service Change Response to the MG the negotiated
              Service  Change  Version.  The  state  would  become
              ASSOCIATION_IN_SERVICE.
   
            4) Depending on the service change reason field (Cold Boot
              or Warm Boot or Service Restored), call contexts would be
              cleared at MGC. MGC should do an audit here as per the
