               Stateful Hash-based Signatures For DNSSEC
             draft-afrvrd-dnsop-stateful-hbs-for-dnssec-00

Abstract

   This document describes how to use stateful hash-based signature
   schemes (SHBSS) with the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  The
   schemes include the Hierarchical Signature System (HSS) variant of
   Leighton-Micali Hash-Based Signatures (HSS/LMS), the eXtended Merkle
   Signature Scheme (XMSS), and XMSS Multi-Tree (XMSS^MT).  In addition,
   DNSKEY and RRSIG record formats for the signature algorithms are
   defined and new algorithm identifiers are described.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), which are
   broadly defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035], use
   cryptographic keys and digital signatures to provide data origin
   authentication and data integrity in the DNS.  Popular digital
   signature algorithms currently required or recommended for DNSSEC
   [RFC8624] include RSA [RFC5702], the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) [RFC6605] and the Edwards-Curve Digital Security
   Algorithm (EdDSA) [RFC8080].

   This document describes how to use the following signature algorithms
   with DNSSEC:

   *  Hierarchical Signature System/Leighton-Micali Hash-Based
      Signatures (HSS/LMS) [RFC8554]

   *  eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) [RFC8391]

   *  XMSS Multi-Tree (XMSS^MT) [RFC8391]

   In addition, algorithm identifiers, DNSKEY record formats and RRSIG
   record formats are defined.  The public key, signature and hash
   lengths specified here-in are based on algorithm parameters that
   specify 32-byte hashes.  This length provides a desired minimum
   128-bit security level.  Use of algorithm parameters specifying
   hashes of lengths other than 32 will result in public key and
   signature lengths that differ from the lengths specified here-in.

   This document covers multi-tree variants of both LMS (HSS/LMS) and
   XMSS (XMSS^MT).  The single tree XMSS variant is also covered as
   XMSS^MT does not provide for a single tree.

   HSS/LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT are variants of Merkle Tree Signatures
   [MERKLE1979].  The multi-tree structures of HSS/LMS and XMSS^MT are
   optimized for incremental one-time key pair generation, where the
   desired number of one-time key pairs and signatures would make pre-
   generation of all one-time key pairs impractical using a single tree
   structure.  HSS/LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT also provide other
   optimizations such as those enabled by use of the Winternitz one-time
   signature scheme [MERKLE1989][HUELSING13].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Double pipe characters, "||" are used in this document in definitions
   of public keys to indicate concatenation of the elements preceding
   and following the double pipe characters.

   All numeric DNSKEY elements and RRSIG elements specified in this
   document are unsigned integers in network byte order (big endian
   order).

3.  DNSKEY Resource Records

3.1.  Algorithm Identifiers

   Algorithms used in DNSSEC are identified by mnemonic identifiers and
   corresponding numeric identifiers that are registered in
   [DNSSECREGISTRY].  Per [RFC4034], the Algorithm field of DNSKEY RRs
   is a numeric identifier that identifies the public key's
   cryptographic algorithm and determines the format of the Public Key
   field.  The mnemonic algorithm identifiers proposed here-in for HSS/
   LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT are "HSSLMS", "XMSS", and "XMSSMT"
   respectively.  These identifiers are proposed for adoption into
   [DNSSECREGISTRY] in the IANA Consideration section Section 7 of this
   document.  It is anticipated that corresponding numeric identifiers
   will be assigned by IANA when the algorithms are registered into
   [DNSSECREGISTRY].  Placeholder numeric identifiers are defined here-
   in for use in examples Section 6.

3.2.  HSS/LMS DNSKEY Resource Records

   The DNSKEY HSS/LMS Public Key field consists of a 60-octet value of
   an HSS/LMS public key generated using one of the parameter sets
   associated with the HSS/LMS algorithm and identified in the IANA
   "Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS)" registry of [LMSREGISTRY].  The
   public key of the HSS/LMS scheme consists of a concatenation of a
   4-octet value L specifying the number of tree levels, followed by the
   elements of the public key for the top-level tree in the HSS/LMS tree
   hierarchy.  The DNSKEY HSS/LMS Public Key field can be described as:


   L || LMS-PUBLIC-KEY


   where LMS_PUBLIC_KEY can be described as:


   LMS-Type || LMS-OTS-Type || I || T[1])


   where the elements are defined as follows:

   *  L: An unsigned 4-octet value specifying the number of tree levels
      in the HSS/LMS tree hierarchy

   *  LMS-Type: A 4-octet identifier for the public key hashing
      algorithm and Merkle tree parameters where the identifier MUST
      match a Numeric Identifier for an algorithm Name listed in the
      "Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS)" registry of [LMSREGISTRY].

   *  LMS-OTS-Type: A 4-octet identifier for the one-time signature
      (OTS) hashing algorithm and parameters where the identifier MUST
      match a Numeric Identifier for an algorithm Name listed in the
      "LMS-OTS Signatures" registry of [LMSREGISTRY].

   *  I: A 16-octet value that is the private key identifier; according
      to Section 5.3 of [RFC8554], I is the value used for all
      computations for the same LMS tree, which in the case of the
      public key is the top-level Merkle Tree.

   *  T[1]: The hash that is the root node for the top level Merkle Tree
      and which serves as the public key.  The length of the hash is
      defined based on the algorithm identified with the LMS-Type field
      and will be at least 32 octets

Internet-Draft           Stateful HBS for DNSSEC              March 2022


   The values of the LMS-Type and LMS-OTS-Type elements MUST specify
   algorithms that create hashes with a length of at least 32 octets.
   Given the minimum hash length of 32 octets, an HSS/LMS public key
   field will have a minimum length of 60 octets.

3.3.  XMSS and XMSS^MT DNSKEY Resource Records

   The DNSKEY public key field of XMSS and XMSS^MT resource records
   consists of an XMSS or XMSS^MT public key generated using a parameter
   set listed in [XMSSREGISTRY].  The DNSKEY XMSS Public Key field and
   the XMSS^MT Public Key field can both be described as:


   OID || T[1] || Seed


   where the elements are defined as follows:

   *  OID: A 4-octet Object Identifier (OID) for the algorithm type
      where OID identifies a signature algorithm applicable to either
      the XMSS or XMSS^MT registry in [XMSSREGISTRY] and where the
      algorithm number field of the DNSKEY RR determine which registry
      is applicable.  OID MUST match a Numeric Identifier for an
      Algorithm Name listed in the applicable registry in [XMSSREGISTRY]
      as identified by the algorithm number field of the DNSKEY RR.

   *  T[1]: An n-octet root node hash from the top-level Merkle Tree
      where "n" is determined based on the algorithm type and MUST be at
      least 32.

   *  Seed: An n-octet seed where "n" is determined based on algorithm
      type and MUST be at least 32.

   The total combined height of the tree levels and the number of tree
   levels in an XMSS^MT tree hierarchy are determined based on the "h/d"
   elements of the algorithm names where "h" is the total combined
   height and "d" is the number of tree levels in the tree hierarchy.
   All trees in an XMSS^MT tree hierarchy MUST be of height h/d per
   section 4.2. of [RFC8391].

   The value of "n" for the length of the root node hash and the seed
   MUST be equal and at least 32.  The set of allowable OIDs is
   therefore limited to algorithm types that use a value of 32 or more
   for "n".  The length of the DNSKEY public key field can be determined
   based on the value of "n".  The minimum length of the DNSKEY Public
   key field is 68 octets based on the minimum allowable value for "n"
   being 32.

4.  RRSIG Resource Records

4.1.  HSS/LMS RRSIG Resource Records

   HSS/LMS signatures consist of a sequence of octet values whose length
   is dependent on the specific algorithm parameters used when creating
   the signature.  Signatures are encoded into the Signature field of an
   RRSIG resource record as a simple octet string.  HSS/LMS signatures
   are composed of elements, as described in 6.2. of [RFC8554], and MUST
   be generated with an algorithm consistent with 6.2. of [RFC8554].

   HSS/LMS signature lengths are determined based on parsing an HSS/LMS
   signature and determining parameters associated with the LMS-Type and
   LMS-OTS-Type elements found in the signatures as illustrated in "Test
   Case 1 Signature" in Appendix F of [RFC8554].  The LMS-Type and LMS-
   OTS-Type elements of the Public Key Field of the DNSKEY RR MUST match
   the LMS-Type and LMS-OTS-Type for the top-level tree in the HSS/LMS
   tree hierarchy.  Table 1 of [RFC8554] illustrates LMS-OTS signature
   lengths for various algorithm parameter sets.  Table 3 of [RFC8554]
   illustrates HSS signature lengths for various algorithm parameter
   sets.

   HSS/LMS signature verification is performed using an algorithm
   functionally equivalent to 6.3. of [RFC8554].  A signature is
   verified if the final hash calculated by the verification algorithm
   matches the public key found in the DNSKEY RR applicable to the
   signature.

4.2.  XMSS and XMSS^MT RRSIG Resource Records

   XMSS and XMSS^MT signatures consist of a sequence of octet values
   whose length is dependent on the specific algorithm parameters used
   when creating the signature.  Signatures are encoded into the
   Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple octet string.
   XMSS signatures are composed of elements as described in 4.1.8. of
   [RFC8391] and MUST be generated using an algorithm consistent with
   4.1.9. of [RFC8391].  XMSS^MT signatures are composed of elements as
   described in 4.2.3. of [RFC8391] and MUST be generated using an
   algorithm consistent with 4.2.4. of [RFC8391].

Internet-Draft           Stateful HBS for DNSSEC              March 2022


   XMSS and XMSS^MT signature lengths are determined based on parameters
   associated with the XMSS or XMSS^MT algorithm identified in
   [XMSSREGISTRY] by the OID element of the public key field of the
   DNSKEY RR associated with the signature and with the Winternitz
   parameter implicitly set to 16 per 5.2. of [RFC8391].  Parameters
   corresponding to an OID are defined as elements of algorithm names
   corresponding to an OID as illustrated in Table 2 and Table 4 of
   [RFC8391].  Table 3 and Table 5 of [RFC8391] illustrate signature
   lengths for various algorithm parameter sets.

   XMSS signature verification is performed using an algorithm
   functionally equivalent to 4.1.10. of [RFC8391].  XMSS^MT signature
   verification is performed using an algorithm functionally equivalent
   to 4.2.5. of [RFC8391].  A signature is verified if the final hash
   calculated by the verification algorithm matches the public key found
   in the DNSKEY RR applicable to the signature.

5.  Implementation Considerations

5.1.  Interoperability Across Implementations

   HSS/LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT implementations for DNSSEC MUST be
   implemented in conformance with [RFC8554] and [RFC8391].
   Implementations subject to [NISTSP800171] MUST be implemented in
   conformance with [NISTSP800208].  The specifications of the
   algorithms herein (signature format and public key format) are
   intended to be "compatible" with the uses of the same algorithms in
   other protocols.  Even though algorithm identifiers may vary by
   protocol (DNSSEC registry here, object identifier in CMS), the
   cryptographic inputs, operations and outputs are the same.
   Implementations therefore SHOULD be interoperable with algorithm
   implementations for other IETF-defined protocols such that the same
   cryptographic libraries may be used across protocols.  In addition to
   being specified here-in, HSS/LMS has been specified in [RFC8708] "Use
   of the HSS/LMS Hash-Based Signature Algorithm in the Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS)" and in [RFC8778] "Use of the HSS/LMS Hash-Based
   Signature Algorithm with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)".
   XMSS and XMSS^MT are not currently specified for use in any protocols
   defined by IETF RFCs.

   Algorithm numbers in DNSKEY records are specific to DNSSEC and are
   registered in [DNSSECREGISTRY].

   Both XMSS and XMSS^MT are covered here-in due to several factors.
   XMSS^MT does not have a single tree level variant and therefore XMSS
   is included for implementations that may wish to use a single Merkle
   tree.  Providing for both variants is also important because limiting
   choice to the parameter sets for XMSS^MT would result in less optimal



Fregly & van Rijswijk-DeExpires 3 September 2022                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           Stateful HBS for DNSSEC              March 2022


   tree and proof sizes for some implementations.  This contrasts with
   covering just HSS/LMS.  LMS is not covered because HSS/LMS provides
   for a single level Merkle tree with minimal overhead compared to a
   single level LMS tree.  This overhead consists of an extra four bytes
   in both RRSIG RRs and DNSKEY RRs.

5.2.  Trade-offs of Hierarchical Trees

   The hierarchical tree structures of HSS/LMS and XMSS^MT allow
   subordinate trees to be generated when needed.  This provides
   flexibility as the entire multi-tree does not need to be generated at
   one time.  This also supports distributed generation of subordinate
   trees and distributed signing operations using distributed
   subordinate trees.  Distributing tree generation and signing provides
   for fault tolerance and scalability that may be desirable based on
   zone characteristics and operational requirements.

   Signatures from multi-level hierarchical tree structures are larger
   than signatures from single tree structures capable of generating the
   same number of signatures.  This is primarily due to OTS signatures
   from each level in the hierarchy being included in the signature
   whereas a signature for a single tree with a height equal to the
   cumulative height of a tree hierarchy will only have a single OTS
   signature included in the signature.

5.3.  Public Keys

   Public keys MUST be created with a hash algorithm providing at least
   a 128-bit security level.  Algorithms for HSS/LMS MUST be selected
   from the "Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS)" registry [LMSREGISTRY].
   Algorithms for XMSS and XMSS^MT MUST be selected from either the
   "XMSS Signatures" or "XMSS^MT Signatures" registries found in
   [XMSSREGISTRY].

5.4.  Operational Considerations

   The larger signature sizes of HSS/LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT will result
   in DNS responses that are too big to fit within typical UDP MTUs, due
   to the size of the included RRSIG RRs.  While EDNS(0) makes it
   possible to transport larger responses that exceed MTUs, implementers
   often try to avoid the resulting fragmentation [FUJIWARA],
   [FLAGDAY2020].  In the absence of EDNS(0), or in case the size of a
   response exceeds the maximum accepted size, as indicated in EDNS(0)
   parameters, DNS responses over UDP will be truncated and the
   requester will be asked to query again over TCP as described in 4. of
   [RFC7766].

   The time needed for key generation and zone signing with stateful
   hash-based signature algorithms may vary significantly based on the
   parameter sets chosen for the algorithm per 6.4. of [RFC8554] and
   5.4.1 of [RFC8391] with this having operational impact.

   Methods for addressing the above-described operational considerations
   are not within the scope of this document and should be addressed in
   additional documents.

6.  Examples

6.1.  Examples Scope

   The examples illustrate HSS/LMS and XMSS^MT public keys and
   signatures applicable to the example MX RR illustrated below.  The
   example public keys may be used to verify the example signatures.
   The example signatures were generated with the example OTS private
   keys.

6.2.  Example Scenario

   The signature examples below are applicable to the following example
   MX record:


   IN MX 10 mail.example.com.


   To facilitate creation of the examples, dummy IANA DNSSEC algorithm
   identifiers are used.  There is no intention that these algorithm
   identifiers have any applicability other than for their use in the
   examples, as future algorithm identifiers assigned by IANA may be
   different than those used in the examples.  Any overlap of these
   identifiers with existing or planned IANA algorithm identifiers is
   unintentional and not meant to supersede the existing or planned
   identifier assignments.  The algorithm identifiers used here-in have
   the following values:


   XMSSMT:     20
   HSSLMS:     21
   XMSS:       22

   A ZSK for a zone is used to sign RRsets within the zone, producing
   RRSIG RRs containing ZSK signatures on the RRsets.  The RRSIG RRs
   link the RRsets into the DNSSEC verification chain and provide for
   verifying RRsets based on verification of the ZSK signatures.
   Further details on DNSSEC verification can be found in [RFC4033],

   The Public Key field of the example XMSS^MT ZSK is broken out in
   hexadecimal below to provide a more readable illustration of the
   elements of an HSS/LMS Public Key Field.


   OID: 00000001 (for the XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256 in [XMSSREGISTRY] which
   identifies the algorithm will use: SHA256 for hashing, use aggregate
   height of 20 with two levels of trees, each of height 10. Note that
   XMSS and XMSS^MT both assume a Winternitz parameter of 16 for OTS
   signatures)

6.4.4.  XMSS^MT RRSIG on the example MX Record with Elements of
        Signature Broken Out in Hexadecimal

   The signature field of the example XMSS^MT RRSIG RR is broken out in
   hexadecimal below to provide a more readable illustration of the
   elements of an XMSS^MT signature.


   Index: 00004b (index of the OTS key from the bottom level tree that
   was used in creating the bottom level OTS signature)

   Random:
   ca4527cf22766962a1f1ef6c98a833008940496b0a68f6239fdfac354eb2d9ee
   (the random seed is used in signature generation to make it harder
   to perform attacks on the signatures)

   Reduced signature for bottom layer tree:

   * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of
   these algorithms with Transaction Security.

   [LMSREGISTRY] and [XMSSREGISTRY] are IANA registries in which
   additional algorithm identifiers may be registered in the future for
   use with HSS/LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT.

   This document refers to allowable HSS/LMS algorithm signature
   identifiers.  These identifiers are found in the IANA "Leighton
   Micali Signatures (LMS)" registry [LMSREGISTRY].

   HSS/LMS refers to allowable LMS OTS algorithm signature identifiers.
   These identifiers are found in the IANA "LM-OTS Signatures" registry
   [LMSREGISTRY].

   This document refers to allowable XMSS and XMSS^MT algorithm
   signature identifiers.  These identifiers are found in the IANA "XMSS
   Signatures" and "XMSS^MT Signatures" registries [XMSSREGISTRY].
   Separate algorithm identifiers for XMSS and XMSS^MT are needed so
   that the appropriate registry in [XMSSREGISTRY] is identified for
   matching OIDs to algorithm parameter sets.

   XMSS and XMSS^MT use a set of allowable XMSS OTS signature
   algorithms.  Identifiers for allowable algorithms (WOTS+ signatures)
   are found in the IANA "WOTS+ Signatures" registry [XMSSREGISTRY].

8.  Implementation Status

   NOTE: Please remove this section and the reference to RFC 794 prior
   to publication as an RFC.

   There are currently no implementations available for public
   examination

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Guidelines for Secure Use of Hash-Based Signature Algorithms

   HSS/LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT as defined here MUST use 256-bit or larger
   hash algorithms. 256-bit hash sizes are consistent with a desired
   minimum 128-bit security level for HSS/LMS, XMSS and XMSS^MT per
   [EATON] [SPHINCSPLUS].

   The HSS/LMS public key MUST be generated in conformance with
   Section 4 of [NISTSP800208].

   The XMSS public key for a single level tree structure or a XMSS^MT
   hierarchical tree structure generated by a single computing device
   ("cryptographic module") MUST be generated in conformance with
   processing steps described in section 5 of [RFC8391].

   Implementations MUST use the same hash algorithm for hashes in all
   nodes within a Merkle Tree or Merkle Tree hierarchy.

   OTS private keys MUST NOT be used more than once for signing.  This
   requirement is needed as re-use of OTS private keys may provide an
   attacker with key information that enables forging of signatures.  A
   detailed discussion of the vulnerabilities re-use of OTS private keys
   enables is described in [OOPS].

Internet-Draft           Stateful HBS for DNSSEC              March 2022


   The requirement that OTS private keys may only be used once creates
   the need for state management to assure OTS keys are not re-used.
   This can be a challenge as state needs to be maintained in case of
   system failure and also across distributed implementations.  This
   challenge is increased for DNSSEC implementations that perform
   dynamic signing.

   Seeds and random numbers used in key generation and for hashing
   SHOULD be generated in accordance with 6.1 and 6.2 of [NISTSP800208].

9.2.  NIST SP 800-208 Compliance

   The requirements in this section apply to implementations subject to
   [NISTSP800208].

   OTS private keys for hash-based algorithms MUST NOT be exported from
   a cryptographic module.  In adherence to this operational constraint,
   OTS private keys for individual sub-trees in a hierarchical Merkle
   Tree structure including the top-level tree MUST be generated, stored
   and used within a single cryptographic module and MUST NOT be
   exported.

   In [NISTSP800208] NIST provides guidance and requirements for multi-
   tree hash-based algorithms implemented across distributed
   "cryptographic modules".  Per 7.2. of [NISTSP800208], these
   implementations require minor changes to XMSS^MT, and no changes to
   HSS/LMS.  XMSS^MT Implementations which distribute trees across
   cryptographic modules and which are subject to [NISTSP800208]
   therefore MUST use the algorithms specified in 7.2. of
   [NISTSP800208].  NIST's approach is to have the cryptographic modules
   for each tree level simply implement a single-tree signature scheme,
   with the signer combining the outputs of the different cryptographic
   modules into a multi-level signature, without further cryptographic
   processing.

   Seeds and random numbers used in key generation and for hashing MUST
   be generated in accordance with 6.1 and 6.2 of [NISTSP800208].
