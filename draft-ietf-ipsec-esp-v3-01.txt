Abstract

   This memo describes an updated version of the Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) protocol, which is designed to provide a mix of
   security services in IPv4 and Ipv6. ESP is used to provide
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, connectionless
   integrity, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence
   integrity), and limited traffic flow confidentiality.  This document
   is based upon RFC 2406 (November 1998).  Section 7 provides a brief
   review of the differences between this document and RFC 2406.

   Comments should be sent to Stephen Kent (kent@bbn.com).

Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


1.  Introduction

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header is designed to
   provide a mix of security services in IPv4 and IPv6.  ESP may be
   applied alone, in combination with the IP Authentication Header (AH)
   [KA98b], or in a nested fashion, e.g., through the use of tunnel mode
   (see "Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol" [KA98a],
   hereafter referred to as the Security Architecture document).
   Security services can be provided between a pair of communicating
   hosts, between a pair of communicating security gateways, or between
   a security gateway and a host.  For more details on how to use ESP
   and AH in various network environments, see the Security Architecture
   document [KA98a].

   The ESP header is inserted after the IP header and before the upper
   layer protocol header (transport mode) or before an encapsulated IP
   header (tunnel mode). These modes are described in more detail below.

   ESP can be used to provide confidentiality, data origin
   authentication, connectionless integrity, an anti-replay service (a
   form of partial sequence integrity), and (limited) traffic flow
   confidentiality. The set of services provided depends on options
   selected at the time of Security Association (SA) establishment and
   on the location of the implementation in a network topology.

   An implementation MAY offer confidentiality independent of all other
   services.  Use of confidentiality without integrity (either in ESP or
   separately in AH) may subject traffic to certain forms of active
   attacks that could undermine the confidentiality service (see
   [Bel96]). ESP allows confidentiality-only SAs because this may offer
   considerably better performance and still provide adequate security,
   e.g., when higher layer authentication/integrity protection is
   offered independently. However, this standard does not require all
   ESP implementations to offer this service separately.

   Data origin authentication and connectionless integrity are joint
   services, hereafter referred to jointly as "integrity." (This term is
   employed because, on a per-packet basis, the computation being
   performed provides connectionless integrity directly; data origin
   authentication is provided indirectly as a result of binding the key
   used to verify the integrity to the identity of the IPsec peer.
   Typically this binding is effected through the use of a shared,
   symmetric key, but an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm also may be
   employed, e.g, to sign a hash.) Integrity-only ESP MUST be offered as
   a service selection option, e.g., it must be negotiable in SA
   management protocols and MUST be configurable via management
   interfaces. Integrity-only ESP is an attractive alternative to AH in


Kent                                                            [Page 4]



Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


   many contexts, e.g., because it is faster to process and more
   amenable to pipelining in many implementations.

   Although confidentiality and integrity can be offered independently,
   most ESP use typically will employ both services, i.e., packets will
   be protected with regard to confidentiality and integrity. Thus there
   are three possible ESP security service combinations involving these
   services:
           - confidentiality-only (SHOULD be supported)
           - integrity-only (MUST be supported)
           - confidentiality and integrity (MUST be supported)

   The anti-replay service may be selected for an SA only if the
   integrity service is selected for that SA. The selection of this
   service is solely at the discretion of the receiver and thus need not
   be negotiated. However, to make use of a new, extended sequence
   number feature in an interoperable fashion, ESP does impose a
   requirement on SA management protocols to be able to negotiate this
   new feature (see Section 2.2.1 below).

   The traffic flow confidentiality (TFC) service generally is effective
   only if ESP is employed in tunnel mode between security gateways, and
   only if sufficient traffic flows between these gateways to conceal
   the characteristics of specific, individual subscriber traffic flows.
   (ESP may be employed as part of a higher layer TFC system, e.g.,
   Onion Routing [Syverson], but such systems are outside the scope of
   this standard.) New TFC features present in ESP facilitate efficient
   generation and discarding of dummy traffic and better padding of real
   traffic, in a backwards compatible fashion.

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in the Security Architecture document.  In particular, the
   reader should be familiar with the definitions of security services
   offered by ESP and AH, the concept of Security Associations, the ways
   in which ESP can be used in conjunction with the Authentication
   Header (AH), and the different key management options available for
   ESP and AH.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Bra97].

2.  Encapsulating Security Payload Packet Format

   The (outer) protocol header (IPv4, IPv6, or Extension) that
   immediately precedes the ESP header SHALL contain the value 50 in its
   Protocol (IPv4) or Next Header (IPv6, Extension) field (see IANA web
   page at http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers). Figure 1
   illustrates the top level format of an ESP packet. The  packet begins
   with two 4-byte fields (SPI and Sequence Number). Following these
   fields is the Payload Data, which has substructure that depends on
   the choice of encryption algorithm and mode, and on the use of TFC
   padding, which is examined in more detail later.  Following the
   Payload Data are Padding and Pad Length fields, and the Next Header
   field. The optional Integrity Check Value (ICV) field completes the
   packet.

              Figure 1.  Top Level Format of an ESP Packet

        * If included in the Payload field, cryptographic synchronization
          data, e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV, see Section 2.3),
          usually is not encrypted per se, although it often is referred
          to as being part of the ciphertext.

   The (transmitted) ESP Trailer consists of the Padding, Pad Length,
   and Next Header fields. Additional, implicit ESP Trailer data (which
   is not transmitted) is included in the integrity computation, as
   described below.


Kent                                                            [Page 6]



Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


   If the integrity service is selected, the integrity computation
   encompasses the SPI, Sequence Number, Payload Data, and the ESP
   Trailer (explicit and implicit).

   If the confidentiality service is selected, the ciphertext consists
   of the Payload Data (except for any cryptographic synchronization
   data that may be included) and the (explicit) ESP Trailer.

   As noted above, the Payload Data may have substructure. An encryption
   algorithm that requires an explicit Initialization Vector (IV), e.g.,
   CBC mode, often prefixes the Payload Data to be protected with that
   value. Some algorithm modes combine encryption and integrity into a
   single operation; this document refers to such algorithm modes as
   "combined mode algorithms." Accommodation of combined mode algorithms
   requires changes to ESP processing sequences and thus is not as
   simple as adding a new encryption or integrity algorithm.

   Some combined mode algorithms provide integrity only for data that is
   encrypted, while others can provide integrity for some additional
   data, data that is not encrypted for transmission. Since the SPI and
   Sequence Number fields require integrity as part of the integrity
   service, and they are not encrypted, it is necessary to ensure that
   they are afforded integrity whenever the service is selected,
   regardless of the style of combined algorithm mode employed.

   When any combined mode algorithm is employed, the algorithm itself is
   expected to return both decrypted plaintext and a pass/fail
   indication for the integrity check. For combined mode algorithms, the
   ICV that would normally appear at the end of the ESP packet (when
   integrity is selected) is omitted. It is the responsibility of the
   combined mode algorithm to encode within the payload data an ICV-
   equivalent means of verifying the integrity of the packet.

   If a combined mode algorithm offers integrity only to data that is
   encrypted, it will be necessary to replicate the SPI and Sequence
   Number as part of the Payload Data.

   Finally, a new provision is made to insert padding for traffic flow
   confidentiality after the Payload Data and before the ESP trailer.
   Figure 2 illustrates this substructure for Payload Data.

        * If tunnel mode is being used, then the IPsec implementation
          can add Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) padding (see
          Section 2.4)  after the Payload Data and before the Padding
          (0-255 bytes) field.

   If a combined algorithm mode is employed, the explicit ICV shown in
   Figures 1 and 2 is omitted (see Section ?? below). Since algorithms
   and modes are fixed when an SA is established, the detailed format of
   ESP packets for a given SA (including the Payload Data substructure)
   is fixed, for all traffic on the SA.

   The tables below refer to the fields in the preceding Figures and
   illustrate how several categories of algorithmic options, each with a
   different processing model, affect the fields noted above. The
   processing details are described in later sections.

                  to ESP

   The following subsections describe the fields in the header format.
   "Optional" means that the field is omitted if the option is not
   selected, i.e., it is present in neither the packet as transmitted
   nor as formatted for computation of an Integrity Check Value (ICV,
   see Section 2.7).  Whether or not an option is selected is determined
   as part of Security Association (SA) establishment.  Thus the format
   of ESP packets for a given SA is fixed, for the duration of the SA.
   In contrast, "mandatory" fields are always present in the ESP packet
   format, for all SAs.

2.1  Security Parameters Index

   The SPI is an arbitrary 32-bit value that is used by a receiver to
   identify the SA to which an incoming packet is bound. The SPI field
   is mandatory.

   For a unicast SA, the SPI can be used by itself to specify an SA, or
   it may be used in conjunction with the IPsec protocol type (in this


Kent                                                           [Page 10]



Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


   case ESP). Since the SPI value is generated by the receiver, whether
   the value is sufficient to identify an SA by itself, or whether it
   must be used in conjunction with the IPsec protocol value is a local
   matter.

   For multicast SAs, the SPI (and optionally the protocol ID) in
   combination with the destination address is used to select an SA.
   This is because multicast SAs are defined by a multicast controller,
   not by each IPsec receiver. (See the Security Architecture document
   for more details.)

   The set of SPI values in the range 1 through 255 are reserved by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for future use; a reserved
   SPI value will not normally be assigned by IANA unless the use of the
   assigned SPI value is specified in an RFC. The SPI value of zero (0)
   is reserved for local, implementation-specific use and MUST NOT be
   sent on the wire. (For example, a key management implementation might
   use the zero SPI value to mean "No Security Association Exists"
   during the period when the IPsec implementation has requested that
   its key management entity establish a new SA, but the SA has not yet
   been established.)


2.2  Sequence Number

   This unsigned 32-bit field contains a counter value that increases by
   one for each packet sent, i.e., a per-SA packet sequence number. For
   a unicast SA or a single-sender multicast SA, the sender MUST
   increment this field for every transmitted packet. Sharing an SA
   among multiple senders is deprecated, since there is no general means
   of synchronizing packet counters among the senders or meaningfully
   managing a receiver packet counter and window in the context of
   multiple senders.

   The field is mandatory and MUST always be present even if the
   receiver does not elect to enable the anti-replay service for a
   specific SA.  Processing of the Sequence Number field is at the
   discretion of the receiver, but all ESP implementations MUST be
   capable of performing the Sequence Number processing described in
   Sections 3.3.3 and 3.4.3. Thus the sender MUST always transmit this
   field, but the receiver need not act upon it (see the discussion of
   Sequence Number Verification in the "Inbound Packet Processing"
   section (3.4.3) below).

   The sender's counter and the receiver's counter are initialized to 0
   when an SA is established. (The first packet sent using a given SA
   will have a Sequence Number of 1; see Section 3.3.3 for more details


Kent                                                           [Page 11]

   on how the Sequence Number is generated.)  If anti-replay is enabled
   (the default), the transmitted Sequence Number must never be allowed
   to cycle.  Thus, the sender's counter and the receiver's counter MUST
   be reset (by establishing a new SA and thus a new key) prior to the
   transmission of the 2^32nd packet on an SA.

2.2.1  Extended Sequence Number

   To support high-speed IPsec implementations, a new option for
   sequence numbers SHOULD be offered, as an extension to the current,
   32-bit sequence number field. Use of an Extended Sequence Number
   (ESN) SHOULD be negotiated by an SA management protocol, although it
   could also be part of the configuration data for a manually
   configured SA.

   The ESN facility allows use of a 64-bit sequence number for an SA.
   (See "Managing 64-bit Sequence Numbers" (See Appendix for details.)
   Only the low order 32 bits of the sequence number are transmitted in
   the plaintext ESP header of each packet, thus minimizing packet
   overhead. The high order 32 bits are maintained as part of the
   sequence number counter by both transmitter and receiver and are
   included in the computation of the ICV (if the integrity service is
   selected).  If a separate integrity algorithm is employed, the high
   order bits are included in the implicit ESP trailer, but are not
   transmitted, analogous to integrity algorithm padding bits. If a
   combined mode algorithm is employed, the algorithm choice determines
   whether the high order ESN bits are transmitted, or are included
   implicitly in the computation. See Section ?? for processing details.


2.3  Payload Data

   Payload Data is a variable-length field containing data (from the
   original IP packet) described by the Next Header field. The Payload
   Data field is mandatory and is an integral number of bytes in length.
   If the algorithm used to encrypt the payload requires cryptographic
   synchronization data, e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV), then this
   data is carried explicitly in the Payload field, but it is not called
   out as a separate field in ESP, i.e., the transmission of an explicit
   IV is invisible to ESP. (See Figure 2.)  Any encryption algorithm
   that requires such explicit, per-packet synchronization data MUST
   indicate the length, any structure for such data, and the location of
   this data as part of an RFC specifying how the algorithm is used with
   ESP.  (Typically the IV immediately precedes the ciphertext. See
   Figure 2.)  If such synchronization data is implicit, the algorithm
   for deriving the data MUST be part of the algorithm definition RFC.
   (If included in the Payload field, cryptographic synchronization


Kent                                                           [Page 12]



Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


   data, e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV), usually is not encrypted
   per se (see Tables 1 and 2), although it sometimes is referred to as
   being part of the ciphertext.)

   Note that the beginning of the transport header (transport mode) or
   the beginning of the encapsulated IP datagram (tunnel mode) MUST be
   aligned relative to the beginning of the ESP header as follows. For
   IPv4, this alignment is a multiple of 4 bytes. For IPv6, the
   alignment is a multiple of 8 bytes.

   With regard to ensuring the alignment of the (real) ciphertext in the
   presence of an IV, note the following:
           o For some IV-based modes of operation, the receiver treats
             the IV as the start of the ciphertext, feeding it into the
             algorithm directly.  In these modes, alignment of the start
             of the (real) ciphertext is not an issue at the receiver.

           o In some cases, the receiver reads the IV in separately from
             the ciphertext.  In these cases, the algorithm specification
             MUST address how alignment of the (real) ciphertext is to be
             achieved.

2.4  Padding (for Encryption)

   Three factors require or motivate use of the Padding field.
           o If an encryption algorithm is employed that requires the
             plaintext to be a multiple of some number of bytes, e.g.,
             the block size of a block cipher, the Padding field is used
             to fill the plaintext (consisting of the Payload Data,
             Padding, Pad Length and Next Header fields) to the size
             required by the algorithm.

           o Padding also may be required, irrespective of encryption
             algorithm requirements, to ensure that the resulting
             ciphertext terminates on a 4-byte boundary. Specifically,
             the Pad Length and Next Header fields must be right aligned
             within a 4-byte word, as illustrated in the ESP packet
             format figures above, to ensure that the ICV field (if
             present) is aligned on a 4-byte boundary.

           o Padding beyond that required for the algorithm or alignment
             reasons cited above, may be used to conceal the actual
             length of the payload, in support of TFC. The padding field
             described here offers limited opportunity for concealing the
             length of the plaintext and thus a new, separate mechanism
             is described below for use when TFC is required (see Section
             2.7).


Kent                                                           [Page 13]



Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)



   The sender MAY add 0 to 255 bytes of padding.  Inclusion of the
   Padding field in an ESP packet is optional, subject to the
   requirements noted above, but all implementations MUST support
   generation and consumption of padding.

           o For the purpose of ensuring that the bits to be encrypted
             are a multiple of the algorithm's blocksize (first bullet
             above), the padding computation applies to the Payload Data
             exclusive of any IV, but including the ESP trailer
             fields. If a combined algorithm mode requires transmission
             of the SPI and Sequence Number to effect integrity, then
             these data items, and any associated, ICV-equivalent data,
             are included in the computation of the pad length. (If the
             ESN option is selected, the high order 32 bits of the ESN
             also would enter into the computation, if the combined mode
             algorithm requires their transmission for integrity.)

           o For the purposes of ensuring that the ICV is aligned on a
             4-byte boundary (second bullet above), the padding
             computation applies to the Payload Data inclusive of the IV,
             the Pad Length, and Next Header fields. If a combined mode
             algorithm is used, any replicated data and ICV-equivalent
             data are included in the Payload Data covered by the padding
             computation.

   If an encryption or combined mode algorithm imposes constraints on
   the values of the bytes used for padding they MUST be specified by
   the RFC defining how the algorithm is employed with ESP. If the
   algorithm requires checking of the values of the bytes used for
   padding, this too MUST be specified in that RFC.

2.5  Pad Length

   The Pad Length field indicates the number of pad bytes immediately
   preceding it in the Padding field.  The range of valid values is 0 to
   255, where a value of zero indicates that no Padding bytes are
   present. As noted above, this does not include any TFC padding bytes.
   The Pad Length field is mandatory.

2.6  Next Header

   The Next Header is a mandatory, 8-bit field that identifies the type
   of data contained in the Payload Data field, e.g., an IPv4 or IPv6
   packet, or an upper layer header and data.  The value of this field
   is chosen from the set of IP Protocol Numbers defined on the web page
   of the IANA, e.g., a value of 4 indicates IPv4, a value of 41


Kent                                                           [Page 14]

                         Security Payload (ESP)


   indicates IPv6 and a value of 6 indicates TCP.

   To facilitate the rapid generation and discarding of the padding
   traffic in support of traffic flow confidentiality (see 2.4), the
   protocol value 59 (which means "no next header") MUST be used to
   designate a "dummy" packet. A transmitter MUST be capable of
   generating dummy packets marked with this value in the next protocol
   field, and a receiver MUST be prepared to discard such packets,
   without indicating an error. All other ESP header and trailer fields
   (SPI, Sequence number, Padding, Pad Length, Next Header, and ICV)
   MUST be present in dummy packets, but the plaintext portion of the
   payload, other than this Next Header field, need not be well-formed,
   e.g., the rest of the Payload Data may consist of only random bytes.
   Dummy packets are discarded without prejudice.

2.7  Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) Padding

   As noted above, the Padding field is limited to 255 bytes in length.
   This generally will not be adequate to hide traffic characteristics
   relative to traffic flow confidentiality requirements. A new field,
   within the payload data, has been added specifically to address the
   TFC requirement.

   An IPsec implementation SHOULD be capable of padding traffic by
   adding bytes after the end of the Payload Data, prior to the
   beginning of the Padding field.  However, this padding (hereafter
   referred to as TFC padding) can be added only if the "Payload Data"
   field contains a specification of the length of the IP datagram,
   e.g., if tunnel mode is employed. This information will enable the
   receiver to discard the TFC padding, because the true length of the
   Payload Data will be known. (ESP trailer fields are located by
   counting back from the end of the ESP packet.)  Accordingly, if TFC
   padding is added, the field containing the specification of the
   length of the IP datagram MUST NOT be modified to reflect this
   padding. No requirements for the value of this padding are
   established by this standard.

   TFC padding takes advantage of an intrinsic feature of IP, i.e.,
   other data may be present in a buffer delivered to an IP interface,
   beyond the packet length indicated by the IP total length field.
   Thus, in tunnel mode, a compliant IP stack at a receiver should
   ignore this padding. In this sense, existing IPsec implementations
   could have made use of this capability previously, in a transparent
   fashion. However, because receivers may not have been prepared to
   deal with this padding, the SA management protocol MUST negotiate
   this service prior to a transmitter employing it, to ensure backward
   compatibility.  Combined with the convention described in section 2.6


Kent                                                           [Page 15]

                         Security Payload (ESP)


   above, about the use of protocol ID 59, an ESP implementation is
   capable of generating dummy and real packets that exhibit much
   greater length variability, in support of TFC.

   In transport mode, this facility generally will not be available,
   consistent with the earlier admonition that effective TFC service in
   IPsec generally requires use of tunnel mode between security
   gateways.

2.8  Integrity Check Value (ICV)

   The Integrity Check Value is a variable-length field computed over
   the ESP header, Payload, and ESP trailer fields. Implicit ESP trailer
   fields (integrity padding and high order ESN bits, if applicable) are
   included in the ICV computation. The ICV field is optional; it is
   present only if the integrity service is selected and a separate (not
   combined mode) integrity algorithm is employed. The length of the
   field is specified by the integrity algorithm selected and associated
   with the SA. The integrity algorithm specification MUST specify the
   length of the ICV and the comparison rules and processing steps for
   validation.


3.  Encapsulating Security Protocol Processing

3.1  ESP Header Location

   ESP may be employed in two ways: transport mode or tunnel mode.  The
   former mode is applicable to host implementations and provides
   protection for upper layer protocols, but not the IP header. (In this
   mode, note that for "bump-in- the-stack" or "bump-in-the-wire"
   implementations, as defined in the Security Architecture document,
   inbound and outbound IP fragments may require an IPsec implementation
   to perform extra IP reassembly/fragmentation in order to both conform
   to this specification and provide transparent IPsec support.  Special
   care is required to perform such operations within these
   implementations when multiple interfaces are in use.)

3.1.1  Transport Mode Processing

   In transport mode, ESP is inserted after the IP header and before an
   upper layer protocol, e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc. In the context of
   IPv4, this translates to placing ESP after the IP header (and any
   options that it contains), but before the upper layer protocol.  (If
   AH is also applied to a packet, it is applied to the ESP header,
   Payload, ESP Trailer and ICV, if present.) (Note that the term
   "transport" mode should not be misconstrued as restricting its use to


Kent                                                           [Page 16]

   TCP and UDP. For example, an ICMP message MAY be sent using either
   "transport" mode or "tunnel" mode.)  The following diagram
   illustrates ESP transport mode positioning for a typical IPv4 packet,
   on a "before and after" basis. (This and subsequent diagrams in this
   section show the ICV field, the presence of which is a function of
   the security services and the algorithm/mode selected.)

            ----------------------------
      IPv4  |orig IP hdr  |     |      |

                          |<-------- integrity ------->|

   In the IPv6 context, ESP is viewed as an end-to-end payload, and thus
   should appear after hop-by-hop, routing, and fragmentation extension
   headers.  Destination options extension header(s) could appear
   before, after, or both before and after the ESP header depending on
   the semantics desired. However, since ESP protects only fields after
   the ESP header, it generally will be desirable to place the
   destination options header(s) after the ESP header. The following
   diagram illustrates ESP transport mode positioning for a typical IPv6
   packet.

3.1.2  Tunnel Mode Processing

   Tunnel mode ESP may be employed in either hosts or security gateways.
   When ESP is implemented in a security gateway to protect subscriber
   transit traffic, tunnel mode MUST be used. (Transport mode MAY be
   used to protect management or similar traffic terminating at a
   security gateway.) In tunnel mode, the "inner" IP header carries the
   ultimate source and destination addresses, while an "outer" IP header
   contains the addresses of the IPsec peers.  In tunnel mode, ESP
   protects the entire inner IP packet, including the entire inner IP
   header.  The position of ESP in tunnel mode, relative to the outer IP
   header, is the same as for ESP in transport mode.  The following
   diagram illustrates ESP tunnel mode positioning for typical IPv4 and
   IPv6 packets.

3.2  Algorithms

   The mandatory-to-implement algorithms are described in Section 5,
   "Conformance Requirements." Other algorithms MAY be supported.  Note
   that although both confidentiality and integrity are optional, at
   least one of these services MUST be selected hence both algorithms
   MUST NOT be simultaneously NULL.

3.2.1  Encryption Algorithms

   The (symmetric) encryption algorithm employed to protect an ESP
   packet is specified by the SA via which the packet is


Kent                                                           [Page 19]

                         Security Payload (ESP)


   transmitted/received. Because IP packets may arrive out of order, and
   not all packets may arrive (packet loss) each packet must carry any
   data required to allow the receiver to establish cryptographic
   synchronization for decryption.  This data may be carried explicitly
   in the payload field, e.g., as an IV (as described above), or the
   data may be derived from the plaintext portions of the (outer IP or
   ESP) packet header. (Note that if plaintext header information is
   used to derive an IV, that information may become security critical
   and thus the protection boundary associated with the encryption
   process may grow.  For example, if one were to use the ESP Sequence
   Number to derive an IV, the Sequence Number generation logic
   (hardware or software) would have to be evaluated as part of the
   encryption algorithm implementation. In the case of FIPS 140-x, this
   could significantly extend the scope of a cryptographic module
   evaluation.)  Since ESP makes provision for padding of the plaintext,
   encryption algorithms employed with ESP may exhibit either block or
   stream mode characteristics.  Note that since encryption
   (confidentiality) is an optional service (e.g., integrity-only ESP),
   this algorithm may be "NULL" [KA98a]

   To allow an ESP implementation to compute the encryption padding
   required by a block mode encryption algorithm, and to determine the
   MTU impact of the algorithm, the RFC for each encryption algorithm
   used with ESP must specify the padding modulus for the algorithm.

3.2.2  Integrity Algorithms

   The integrity algorithm employed for the ICV computation is specified
   by the SA via which the packet is transmitted/received. As was the
   case for encryption algorithms, any integrity algorithm employed with
   ESP must make provisions to permit processing of packets that arrive
   out of order and to accommodate packet loss. The same admonition
   noted above applies to use of any plaintext data to facilitate
   receiver synchronization of integrity algorithms. Note that since the
   integrity service MAY be optional, this algorithm may be "NULL".

   To allow an ESP implementation to compute any implicit integrity
   algorithm padding required, the RFC for each algorithm used with ESP
   must specify the padding modulus for the algorithm.

3.2.3 Combined Mode Algorithms

   If a combined mode algorithm is employed, both confidentiality and
   integrity services are provided. As was the case for encryption
   algorithms, a combined mode algorithm must make provisions for per-
   packet cryptographic synchronization, to permit decryption of packets
   that arrive out of order and to accommodate packet loss. The means by


Kent                                                           [Page 20]

   which a combined mode algorithm provides integrity for the payload,
   and for the SPI and (Extended) Sequence Number fields, may vary for
   different algorithm choices. In order to provide a uniform, algorithm
   independent approach to invocation of combined mode algorithms, no
   payload substructure is defined. For example, the SPI and Sequence
   Number fields might be replicated within the ciphertext envelope and
   an ICV may be appended to the ESP Trailer. None of these details
   should be observable externally.

   To allow an ESP implementation to determine the MTU impact of a
   combined mode algorithm, the RFC for each algorithm used with ESP
   must specify a (simple) formula that yields encrypted payload size,
   as a function of the plaintext payload and sequence number sizes.

3.3  Outbound Packet Processing

   In transport mode, the sender encapsulates the upper layer protocol
   information between the ESP header and the ESP trailer fields, and
   retains the specified IP header (and any IP extension headers in the
   IPv6 context).  In tunnel mode, the outer and inner IP
   header/extensions can be inter-related in a variety of ways.  The
   construction of the outer IP header/extensions during the
   encapsulation process is described in the Security Architecture
   document.  If more than one IPsec header/extension is required by
   security policy, the order of the application of the security headers
   MUST be defined by security policy.

3.3.1  Security Association Lookup

   ESP is applied to an outbound packet only after an IPsec
   implementation determines that the packet is associated with an SA
   that calls for ESP processing.  The process of determining what, if
   any, IPsec processing is applied to outbound traffic is described in
   the Security Architecture document.

3.3.2  Packet Encryption and Integrity Check Value (ICV) Calculation

   In this section, we speak in terms of encryption always being applied
   because of the formatting implications.  This is done with the
   understanding that "no confidentiality" is offered by using the NULL
   encryption algorithm (RFC 2410).  There are several algorithmic
   options.

3.3.2.1 Separate Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms

   If separate confidentiality and integrity algorithms are employed,
   the sender:
           1. encapsulates (into the ESP Payload field):
                   - for transport mode -- just the original upper layer
                     protocol information.
                   - for tunnel mode -- the entire original IP datagram.

           2. adds any necessary padding  Optional TFC padding and
              (encryption) Padding

           3. encrypts the result using the key, encryption algorithm,
              and algorithm mode specified for the SA and using any
              required cryptographic synchronization data.
                   - If explicit cryptographic synchronization data,
                     e.g., an IV, is indicated, it is input to the
                     encryption algorithm per the algorithm specification
                     and placed in the Payload field.
                   - If implicit cryptographic synchronization data is
                     employed, it is constructed and input to the
                     encryption algorithm as per the algorithm
                     specification.
                   - If integrity is selected, encryption is performed
                     first, before the integrity algorithm is applied,
                     and the encryption does not encompass the ICV
                     field. This order of processing facilitates rapid
                     detection and rejection of replayed or bogus packets
                     by the receiver, prior to decrypting the packet,
                     hence potentially reducing the impact of denial of
                     service attacks.  It also allows for the possibility
                     of parallel processing of packets at the receiver,
                     i.e., decryption can take place in parallel with
                     integrity checking.  Note that since the ICV is not
                     protected by encryption, a keyed integrity algorithm
                     must be employed to compute the ICV.

           4. computes the ICV over the ESP packet minus the ICV field.
              Thus the ICV computation encompasses the SPI, Sequence
              Number, Payload Data, Padding (if present), Pad Length, and
              Next Header. (Note that the last 4 fields will be in
              ciphertext form, since encryption is performed first.) If
              the ESN option is enabled for the SA, it the high-order 32
              bits of the Sequence Number are appended after the Next
              Header field for purposes of this computation, but are not
              transmitted.

                         Security Payload (ESP)


   For some integrity algorithms, the byte string over which the ICV
   computation is performed must be a multiple of a block size specified
   by the algorithm. If the length of ESP packet (as described above)
   does not match the block size requirements for the algorithm,
   implicit padding MUST be appended to the end of the ESP packet. (This
   padding is added after the Next Header field, or after the high-order
   32 bits of the Sequence Number, if ESN is selected.) The padding
   octets MUST have a value of zero.  The block size (and hence the
   length of the padding) is specified by the integrity algorithm
   specification. This padding is not transmitted with the packet. Note
   that MD5 and SHA-1 are viewed as having a 1-byte block size because
   of their internal padding conventions.

3.3.2.2 Combined Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms

   If a combined confidentiality/integrity algorithm is employed, the
   sender:

           1. encapsulates into the ESP Payload Data field:
                   - for transport mode -- just the original upper layer
                     protocol information.
                   - for tunnel mode -- the entire original IP datagram.

           2. adds any necessary paddingincludes optional TFC padding
              and Padding.

           3. encrypts and integrity protects the result using the key
              and combined mode algorithm specified for the SA and using
              any required cryptographic synchronization data.
                   - If explicit cryptographic synchronization data,
                     e.g., an IV, is indicated, it is input to the
                     combined mode algorithm per the algorithm
                     specification and placed in the Payload field.
                   - If implicit cryptographic synchronization data is
                     employed, it is constructed and input to the
                     encryption algorithm as per the algorithm
                     specification.
                   - The Sequence Number (or Extended Sequence Number, as
                     appropriate) and the SPI are inputs to the
                     algorithm, as they must be included in the integrity
                     check computation. The means by which these values
                     are included in this computation are a function of
                     the combined mode algorithm employed and thus not
                     specified in this standard.
                   - The (explicit) ICV field is NOT part of the ESP packet
                     format when a combined mode algorithm is employed,

                     integrity fields, and the means by which the
                     Sequence Number and SPI are included in the
                     integrity computation MUST be defined in an RFC that
                     defines the use of the combined mode algorithm with
                     ESP.

3.3.3  Sequence Number Generation

   The sender's counter is initialized to 0 when an SA is established.
   The sender increments the Sequence Number (or ESN) for this SA and
   inserts the low-order 32 bits of the value into the Sequence Number
   field. Thus the first packet sent using a given SA will contain a
   Sequence Number of 1.

   If anti-replay is enabled (the default), the sender checks to ensure
   that the counter has not cycled before inserting the new value in the
   Sequence Number field.  In other words, the sender MUST NOT send a
   packet on an SA if doing so would cause the Sequence Number to cycle.
   An attempt to transmit a packet that would result in Sequence Number
   overflow is an auditable event. The audit log entry for this event
   SHOULD include the SPI value, current date/time, Source Address,
   Destination Address, and (in IPv6) the cleartext Flow ID.

   The sender assumes anti-replay is enabled as a default, unless
   otherwise notified by the receiver (see 3.4.3) or if the SA was
   configured using manual key management.  Thus typical behavior of an
   ESP implementation calls for the sender to establish a new SA when
   the Sequence Number (or ESN) cycles, or in anticipation of this value
   cycling.

   If anti-replay is disabled (as noted above), the sender does not need
   to monitor or reset the counter, e.g., in the case of manual key
   management (see Section 5).  However, the sender still increments the
   counter and when it reaches the maximum value, the counter rolls over
   back to zero.

   If ESN (see Appendix) is selected, only the low order 32 bits of the
   sequence number are transmitted in the Sequence Number field,
   although both sender and receiver maintain full 64-bit ESN counters.
   The high order 32 bits are included in the integrity check in an
   algorithm/mode-specific fashion, e.g., the high order 32 bits may be
   appended after the Next Header field when a separate integrity
   algorithm is employed.

3.3.4  Fragmentation

   If necessary, fragmentation is performed after ESP processing within
   an IPsec implementation.  Thus, transport mode ESP is applied only to
   whole IP datagrams (not to IP fragments).  An IP packet to which ESP
   has been applied may itself be fragmented by routers en route, and
   such fragments must be reassembled prior to ESP processing at a
   receiver.  In tunnel mode, ESP is applied to an IP packet, which may
   be a fragment of an IP datagram.  For example, a security gateway or
   a "bump-in-the-stack" or "bump-in-the-wire" IPsec implementation (as
   defined in the Security Architecture document) may apply tunnel mode
   ESP to such fragments.

   NOTE: For transport mode -- As mentioned at the beginning of Section
   3.1, bump- in-the-stack and bump-in-the-wire implementations may have
   to first reassemble a packet fragmented by the local IP layer, then
   apply IPsec, and then fragment the resulting packet.

   NOTE: For IPv6 -- For bump-in-the-stack and bump-in-the-wire
   implementations, it will be necessary to examine all the extension
   headers to determine if there is a fragmentation header and hence
   that the packet needs reassembling prior to IPsec processing.

   Fragmentation, whether performed by an IPsec implementation or by
   routers along the path between IPsec peers, significantly reduces
   performance. Moreover, the requirement for an ESP receiver to accept
   fragments for reassembly creates denial of service vulnerabilities.
   Thus an ESP implementation MAY choose to not support fragmentation
   and may mark transmitted packets with the DF bit, to facilitate PMTU
   discovery. In any case, an ESP implementation MUST support generation
   of ICMP PMTU messages (or equivalent internal signaling for native
   host implementations) to minimize the likelihood of fragmentation.
   Details of the support required for MTU management are contained in
   the Security Architecture document.

3.4  Inbound Packet Processing

3.4.1  Reassembly

   If required, reassembly is performed prior to ESP processing. If a
   packet offered to ESP for processing appears to be an IP fragment,
   i.e., the OFFSET field is non-zero or the MORE FRAGMENTS flag is set,
   the receiver MUST discard the packet; this is an auditable event. The
   audit log entry for this event SHOULD include the SPI value,
   date/time received, Source Address, Destination Address, Sequence
   Number, and (in IPv6) the Flow ID.



Kent                                                           [Page 25]

                         Security Payload (ESP)


   NOTE: For packet reassembly, the current IPv4 spec does NOT require
   either the zeroing of the OFFSET field or the clearing of the MORE
   FRAGMENTS flag.  In order for a reassembled packet to be processed by
   IPsec (as opposed to discarded as an apparent fragment), the IP code
   must do these two things after it reassembles a packet.

3.4.2  Security Association Lookup

   Upon receipt of a packet containing an ESP Header, the receiver
   determines the appropriate (unidirectional) SA, based on the SPI
   alone (unicast) or SPI combined with destination IP address
   (multicast). (This process is described in more detail in the
   Security Architecture document.) The SA indicates whether the
   Sequence Number field will be checked and whether 32 or 64-bit
   Sequence Numbers are employed for the SA, whether the (explicit) ICV
   field should be present (and if so, its size), and it will specify
   the algorithms and keys to be employed for decryption and ICV
   computations (if applicable).

   If no valid Security Association exists for this session (for
   example, the receiver has no key), the receiver MUST discard the
   packet; this is an auditable event.  The audit log entry for this
   event SHOULD include the SPI value, date/time received, Source
   Address, Destination Address, Sequence Number, and (in IPv6) the
   cleartext Flow ID.

   Note that SA management traffic does not need to be processed based
   on SPI, i.e., one can demultiplex this traffic separately, e.g.,
   based on Next Protocol and Port fields.

3.4.3  Sequence Number Verification

   All ESP implementations MUST support the anti-replay service, though
   its use may be enabled or disabled by the receiver on a per-SA basis.
   This service MUST NOT be enabled unless the ESP integrity service
   also is enabled for the SA, since otherwise the Sequence Number field
   has not been integrity protected.  (Note that there are no provisions
   for managing transmitted Sequence Number values among multiple
   senders directing traffic to a single SA, irrespective of whether the
   destination address is unicast, broadcast, or multicast.  Thus the
   anti-replay service SHOULD NOT be used in a multi-sender environment
   that employs a single SA.)

   If the receiver does not enable anti-replay for an SA, no inbound
   checks are performed on the Sequence Number. However, from the
   perspective of the sender, the default is to assume that anti-replay
   is enabled at the receiver. To avoid having the sender do unnecessary


Kent                                                           [Page 26]

   sequence number monitoring and SA setup (see section 3.3.3), if an SA
   establishment protocol is employed, the receiver SHOULD notify the
   sender, during SA establishment, if the receiver will not provide
   anti-replay protection.

   If the receiver has enabled the anti-replay service for this SA, the
   receive packet counter for the SA MUST be initialized to zero when
   the SA is established.  For each received packet, the receiver MUST
   verify that the packet contains a Sequence Number that does not
   duplicate the Sequence Number of any other packets received during
   the life of this SA.  This SHOULD be the first ESP check applied to a
   packet after it has been matched to an SA, to speed rejection of
   duplicate packets.

   ESP permits two-stage verification of packet sequence numbers. This
   capability is important whenever an ESP implementation (typically the
   cryptographic module portion thereof) is not capable of performing
   decryption and/or integrity checking at the same rate as the
   interface(s) to unprotected networks. If the implementation is
   capable of such "line rate" operation, then it is not necessary to
   perform the preliminary verification stage described below.

   The preliminary Sequence Number check is effected utilizing the
   Sequence Number value in the ESP Header and is performed prior to
   integrity checking and decryption. If this preliminary check fails,
   the packet is discarded, thus avoiding the need for any cryptographic
   operations by the receiver. If the preliminary check is successful,
   the receiver cannot yet modify it's local counter, since the
   integrity of the Sequence Number has not been verified at this point.

   Duplicates are rejected through the use of a sliding receive window.
   How the window is implemented is a local matter, but the following
   text describes the functionality that the implementation must
   exhibit.

   The "right" edge of the window represents the highest, validated
   Sequence Number value received on this SA. Packets that contain
   Sequence Numbers lower than the "left" edge of the window are
   rejected. Packets falling within the window are checked against a
   list of received packets within the window.  If the ESN option is
   selected for an SA, only the low-order 32 bits of the sequence number
   are explicitly transmitted, but the receiver employs the full
   sequence number computed using the high-order 32 bits for the
   indicated SA (from his local counter) when checking the received
   Sequence Number against the receive window. In constructing the full
   sequence number, if the low order 32 bits carried in the packet are
   lower in value than the low order 32 bits of the receiver's sequence


Kent                                                           [Page 27]

   number, the receiver assumes that the high order 32 bits have been
   incremented, moving to a new sequence number subspace.  (This
   algorithm accommodates gaps in reception for a single SA as large as
   2**32-1 packets. If a larger gap occurs, additional, heuristic checks
   for resynchronization of the receiver sequence number counter MAY be
   employed, as described in the Appendix.)

   If the received packet falls within the window and is not a
   duplicate, or if the packet is to the right of the window, and if a
   separate integrity algorithm is employed, then the receiver proceeds
   to integrity verification. If a combined mode algorithm is employed,
   the integrity check is performed along with decryption. In either
   case, if the integrity check fails, the receiver MUST discard the
   received IP datagram as invalid; this is an auditable event.  The
   audit log entry for this event SHOULD include the SPI value,
   date/time received, Source Address, Destination Address, the Sequence
   Number, and (in IPv6) the Flow ID.  The receive window is updated
   only if the integrity verification succeeds. (If a combined mode
   algorithm is being used, then the integrity protected Sequence Number
   must also match the Sequence Number used for anti-replay protection.)

   A minimum window size of 32 packets MUST be supported when 32-bit
   sequence numbers are employed; a window size of 64 is preferred and
   SHOULD be employed as the default. Another window size (larger than
   the minimum) MAY be chosen by the receiver.  (The receiver does NOT
   notify the sender of the window size.)  The receive window size
   should be increased for higher speed environments, irrespective of
   assurance issues. Values for minimum and recommended receive window
   sizes for very high speed (e.g., multi-gigabit/second) devices are
   not specified by this standard.

3.4.4  Integrity Check Value Verification

   As with outbound processing, there are several options for inbound
   processing, based on features of the algorithms employed.

3.4.4.1 Separate Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms

   If separate confidentiality and integrity algorithms are employed,
           1. if integrity has been selected, the receiver computes the
              ICV over the ESP packet minus the ICV, using the specified
              integrity algorithm and verifies that it is the same as the
              ICV carried in the packet.  Details of the computation are
              provided below.

              If the computed and received ICV's match, then the datagram
              is valid, and it is accepted.  If the test fails, then the


Kent                                                           [Page 28]



Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


              receiver MUST discard the received IP datagram as invalid;
              this is an auditable event.  The log data SHOULD include
              the SPI value, date/time received, Source Address,
              Destination Address, the Sequence Number, and (for IPv6)
              the cleartext Flow ID.

              DISCUSSION:

              Begin by removing and saving the ICV field. Next check the
              overall length of the ESP packet minus the ICV field. If
              implicit padding is required, based on the blocksize of the
              integrity algorithm, append zero-filled bytes to the end of
              the ESP packet directly after the Next Header
              field. Perform the ICV computation and compare the result
              with the saved value, using the comparison rules defined by
              the algorithm specification.

           2. the receiver decrypts the ESP Payload Data, Padding, Pad
              Length, and Next Header using the key, encryption
              algorithm, algorithm mode, and cryptographic
              synchronization data (if any), indicated by the SA. As in
              section 3.3.2, we speak here in terms of encryption always
              being applied because of the formatting implications.  This
              is done with the understanding that "no confidentiality" is
              offered by using the NULL encryption algorithm (RFC 2410).

                   - If explicit cryptographic synchronization data,
                     e.g., an IV, is indicated, it is taken from the
                     Payload field and input to the decryption algorithm
                     as per the algorithm specification.

                   - If implicit cryptographic synchronization data is
                     indicated, a local version of the IV is constructed
                     and input to the decryption algorithm as per the
                     algorithm specification.

           3. the receiver processes any Padding as specified in the
              encryption algorithm specification. If the default padding
              scheme (see Section 2.4) has been employed, the receiver
              SHOULD inspect the Padding field before removing the
              padding prior to passing the decrypted data to the next
              layer.

           4. the receiver checks the Next Header field. If the value is
              "59" (no next header), the (dummy) packet is discarded
              without further processing.



Kent                                                           [Page 29]



Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


           5. the receiver reconstructs the original IP datagram from:
                   - for transport mode -- original IP header plus the
                     original upper layer protocol information in the ESP
                     Payload field
                   - for tunnel mode -- tunnel IP header + the entire IP
                     datagram in the ESP Payload field.

              The exact steps for reconstructing the original datagram
              depend on the mode (transport or tunnel) and are described
              in the Security Architecture document.  At a minimum, in an
              IPv6 context, the receiver SHOULD ensure that the decrypted
              data is 8-byte aligned, to facilitate processing by the
              protocol identified in the Next Header field. This
              processing "discards" any (optional) TFC padding that has
              been added for traffic flow confidentiality. (If present,
              this will have been inserted after the IP datagram (or
              transport-layer frame) and before the Padding field (see
              section 2.4).)

   If integrity checking and encryption are performed in parallel,
   integrity checking MUST be completed before the decrypted packet is
   passed on for further processing.  This order of processing
   facilitates rapid detection and rejection of replayed or bogus
   packets by the receiver, prior to decrypting the packet, hence
   potentially reducing the impact of denial of service attacks.

   Note: If the receiver performs decryption in parallel with integrity
   checking, care must be taken to avoid possible race conditions with
   regard to packet access and extraction of the decrypted packet.


3.4.4.2 Combined Mode Algorithms

   If a combined confidentiality and integrity algorithm is employed,
   then the receiver:

           1. decrypts and integrity checks the ESP Payload Data,
              Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header, using the key,
              algorithm, algorithm mode, and cryptographic
              synchronization data (if any), indicated by the SA. The SPI
              from the ESP header, and the (receiver) packet counter
              value (adjusted as required from the processing described
              in Section 3.4.3) are inputs to this algorithm, as they are
              required for the integrity check.

                   - If explicit cryptographic synchronization data,
                     e.g., an IV, is indicated, it is taken from the

Internet Draft              IP Encapsulating               November 2001
                         Security Payload (ESP)


                     Payload field and input to the decryption algorithm
                     as per the algorithm specification.

                   - If implicit cryptographic synchronization data,
                     e.g., an IV, is indicated, a local version of the IV
                     is constructed and input to the decryption algorithm
                     as per the algorithm specification.

           2. if the integrity check performed by the combined mode
              algorithm fails, the receiver MUST discard the received IP
              datagram as invalid; this is an auditable event.  The log
              data SHOULD include the SPI value, date/time received,
              Source Address, Destination Address, the Sequence Number,
              and (in IPv6) the cleartext Flow ID.

           3. processes any Padding as specified in the encryption
              algorithm specification, if the algorithm has not already
              done so.

           4. the receiver checks the Next Header field. If the value is
              "59" (no next header), the (dummy) packet is discarded
              without further processing.

           5. extracts the original IP datagram (tunnel mode) or
              transport-layer frame (transport mode) from the ESP Payload
              Data field.  This implicitly discards any (optional)
              padding that has been added for traffic flow
              confidentiality. (If present, the TFC padding will have
              been inserted after the IP payload and before the Padding
              field (see section 2.4).)

4.  Auditing

   Not all systems that implement ESP will implement auditing.  However,
   if ESP is incorporated into a system that supports auditing, then the
   ESP implementation MUST also support auditing and MUST allow a system
   administrator to enable or disable auditing for ESP.  For the most
   part, the granularity of auditing is a local matter.  However,
   several auditable events are identified in this specification and for
   each of these events a minimum set of information that SHOULD be
   included in an audit log is defined.

           - No valid Security Association exists for a session.  The
             audit log entry for this event SHOULD include the SPI value,
             date/time received, Source Address, Destination Address,
             Sequence Number, and (for IPv6) the cleartext Flow ID.



Kent                                                           [Page 31]

                         Security Payload (ESP)


           - A packet offered to ESP for processing appears to be an IP
             fragment, i.e., the OFFSET field is non-zero or the MORE
             FRAGMENTS flag is set.  The audit log entry for this event
             SHOULD include the SPI value, date/time received, Source
             Address, Destination Address, Sequence Number, and (in IPv6)
             the Flow ID.

           - Attempt to transmit a packet that would result in Sequence
             Number overflow.  The audit log entry for this event SHOULD
             include the SPI value, current date/time, Source Address,
             Destination Address, Sequence Number, and (for IPv6) the
             cleartext Flow ID.

           - The received packet fails the anti-replay checks. The audit
             log entry for this event SHOULD include the SPI value,
             date/time received, Source Address, Destination Address, the
             Sequence Number, and (in IPv6) the Flow ID.

           - The integrity check fails.  The audit log entry for this
             event SHOULD include the SPI value, date/time received,
             Source Address, Destination Address, the Sequence Number,
             and (for IPv6) the Flow ID.

   Additional information also MAY be included in the audit log for each
   of these events, and additional events, not explicitly called out in
   this specification, also MAY result in audit log entries.  There is
   no requirement for the receiver to transmit any message to the
   purported sender in response to the detection of an auditable event,
   because of the potential to induce denial of service via such action.

5.  Conformance Requirements

   Implementations that claim conformance or compliance with this
   specification MUST implement the ESP syntax and processing described
   here and MUST comply with all additional packet processing
   requirements levied by the Security Architecture document [KA98a].
   If the key used to compute an ICV is manually distributed, correct
   provision of the anti-replay service would require correct
   maintenance of the counter state at the sender, until the key is
   replaced, and there likely would be no automated recovery provision
   if counter overflow were imminent. Thus a compliant implementation
   SHOULD NOT provide anti-replay service in conjunction with SAs that
   are manually keyed.  A compliant ESP implementation MUST support the
   following mandatory-to-implement algorithms:

           - AES in CBC mode
           - HMAC with MD5 [MG98a]


Kent                                                           [Page 32]

                         Security Payload (ESP)


           - HMAC with SHA-1 [MG98b]
           - NULL Encryption algorithm (RFC 2410)

   Since use of encryption in ESP is optional, support for the "NULL"
   encryption algorithm is required to maintain consistency with the way
   ESP services are negotiated. Support for the confidentiality-only
   service version of ESP is optional. If an implementation offers this
   service, it MUST also support the negotiation of the NULL integrity
   algorithm. NOTE that while integrity and encryption may each be
   "NULL" under the circumstances noted above, they MUST NOT both be
   "NULL".

6.  Security Considerations

   Security is central to the design of this protocol, and thus security
   considerations permeate the specification.  Additional security-
   relevant aspects of using the IPsec protocol are discussed in the
   Security Architecture document.

7.  Differences from RFC 2406

   This document differs from RFC 2406 in a number of significant ways.

           o Confidentiality-only service -- now a SHOULD, not a MUST.
           o SPI -- modified to better reflect the differences between
             unicast and multicast SA lookups.  For unicast, the SPI may
             be used alone to select an SA; for multicast, the SPI is
             combined with destination address to select an SA.
           o Sequence number -- added a new option for a 64-bit sequence
             number for very high-speed communications.
           o Payload data -- broadened model to accommodate combined mode
             algorithms.
           o Padding for improved traffic flow confidentiality -- added
             requirement to be able to add bytes after the end of the IP
             Payload, prior to the beginning of the Padding field.
           o Next Header -- added requirement to be able to generate and
             discard dummy padding packets (Next Header = 59)
           o ICV -- broadened model to accommodate combined mode algorithms.
           o Algorithms -- Added combined confidentiality mode algorithms.
           o Inbound and Outbound packet processing -- there are now two
             paths -- (1) separate confidentiality and integrity
             algorithms, (2) combined confidentiality mode
             algorithms. Because of the addition of combined mode
             algorithms, the encryption/decryption and integrity sections
             have been combined for both inbound and outbound packet
             processing.
