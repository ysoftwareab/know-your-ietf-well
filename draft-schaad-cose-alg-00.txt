1.  Introduction

   In the process of writing RFCXXXX [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] several items
   were removed from that ocument to be addressed at a later date.  This
   document was created to address those items.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   When the words appear in lower case, their natural language meaning
   is used.

1.2.  CBOR Grammar

   There currently is no standard CBOR grammar available for use by
   specifications.  We therefore describe the CBOR structures in prose.
   There is a version of a CBOR grammar in the CBOR Data Definition
   Language (CDDL) [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl].  An
   informational version of the CBOR grammar that reflects what is in
   the prose can be found in Appendix A.  CDDL has not been fixed, so
   this grammar may will only work with the version of CDDL at the time
   of publishing.

   The document was developed by first working on the grammar and then
   developing the prose to go with it.  An artifact of this is that the

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax          October 2015


   prose was written using the primitive type strings defined by early
   versions CDDL.  In this specification the following primitive types
   are used:

      bstr - byte string (major type 2).

      int - an unsigned integer or a negative integer.

      nil - a null value (tag 7.22).

      nint - a negative integer (major type 1).

      tstr - a UTF-8 text string (major type 3).

      uint - an unsigned integer (major type 0).

   Text from here to start of next section to be removed

   NOTE: For the purposes of review, we are currently interlacing the
   CDLL grammar into the text of document.  This is being done for
   simplicity of comparision of the grammar againist the prose.  The
   grammar will be removed to an appendix during WGLC.


start = COSE_Untagged_Message / COSE_Tagged_Message / COSE_Key / COSE_KeySet

1.3.  Document Terminology

   In this document we use the following terminology: [CREF1]

2.  Signature Algorithms

   There are two basic signature algorithm structures that can be used.
   The first is the common signature with appendix.  In this structure,
   the message content is processed and a signature is produced, the
   signature is called the appendix.  This is the message structure used
   by our common algorithms such as ECDSA and RSASSA-PSS.  (In fact the
   SSA in RSASSA-PSS stands for Signature Scheme with Appendix.)  The
   basic structure becomes:


   signature = Sign(message content, key)

   valid = Verification(message content, key, signature)


   The second is a signature with message recovery.  (An example of such
   an algorithm is [PVSig].)  In this structure, the message content is



Schaad                   Expires April 19, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax          October 2015


   processed, but part of is included in the signature.  Moving bytes of
   the message content into the signature allows for an effectively
   smaller signature, the signature size is still potentially large, but
   the message content is shrunk.  This has implications for systems
   implementing these algoritms and for applications that use them.  The
   first is that the message content is not fully available until after
   a signature has been validated.  Until that point the part of the
   message contained inside of the signature is unrecoverable.  The
   second is that the security analysis of the strength of the signature
   is very much based on the structure of the message content.  Messages
   which are highly predictable require additional randomness to be
   supplied as part of the signature process, in the worst case it
   becomes the same as doing a signature with appendix.  Thirdly, in the
   event that multple signatures are applied to a message, all of the
   signature algorithms are going to be required to consume the same
   number of bytes of message content.


   signature, message sent = Sign(message content, key)

   valid, message content = Verification(message sent, key, signature)


   At this time, only signatures with appendixes are defined for use
   with COSE, however considerable interest has been expressed in using
   a signature with message recovery algorithm due to the effective size
   reduction that is possible.  Implementations will need to keep this
   in mind for later possible integration.

2.1.  RSASSA-PSS

   The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is defined in [RFC3447].

   The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is parametized with a hash
   function (h), a mask generation function (mgf) and a salt length
   (sLen).  For this specification, the mask generation function is
   fixed to be MGF1 as defined in [RFC3447].  It has been recommended
   that the same hash function be used for hashing the data as well as
   in the mask generation function, for this specification we following
   this recommendation.  The salt length is the same length as the hash
   function output.

   Implementations need to check that the key type is 'RSA' when
   creating or verifying a signature.

   The algorithms defined in this document can be found in Table 1.

                   Table 1: RSASSA-PSS Algorithm Values

2.1.1.  Security Considerations

   In addition to needing to worry about keys that are too small to
   provide the required security, there are issues with keys that are
   too large.  Denial of service attacks have been mounted with overly
   large keys.  This has the potential to consume resources with
   potentially bad keys.  There are two reasonable ways to address this
   attack.  First, a key should not be used for a cryptographic
   operation until it has been matched back to an authorized user.  This
   approach means that no cryptography would be done except for
   authorized users.  Second, applications can impose maximum as well as
   minimum length requirements on keys.  This limits the resources
   consumed even if the matching is not performed until the cryptography
   has been done.

   There is a theoretical hash substitution attack that can be mounted
   against RSASSA-PSS.  However, the requirement that the same hash
   function be used consistently for all operations is an effective
   mitigation against it.  Unlike ECDSA, hash functions are not
   truncated so that the full hash value is always signed.  The internal
   padding structure of RSASSA-PSS means that one needs to have multiple
   collisions between the two hash functions in order to be successful
   in producing a forgery based on changing the hash function.  This is
   highly unlikely.

2.2.  Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithms (EdDSA)

   Reference for these is [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

   The algorithms defined in this document can be found in Table 2.

3.  Message Authentication (MAC) Algorithms

   Message Authentication Codes (MACs) provide data authentication and
   integrity protection.  They provide either no or very limited data
   origination.  (One cannot, for example, be used to prove the identity
   of the sender to a third party.)

   MACs are designed in the same basic structure as signature with
   appendix algorithms.  The message content is processed and an
   authentication code is produced, the authentication code is
   frequently called a tag.  The basic structure becomes:


   tag = MAC_Create(message content, key)

   valid = MAC_Verify(message content, key, tag)


   MAC algorithms can be based on either a block cipher algorithm (i.e.
   AES-MAC) or a hash algorithm (i.e.  HMAC).  This document defines a
   MAC algorithm for each of these two constructions.

4.  Content Encryption Algorithms

   Content Encryption Algorithms provide data confidentialty for
   potentially large blocks of data using a symmetric key.  They provide
   either no or very limited data origination.  (One cannot, for
   example, be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third
   party.)  The ability to provide data origination is linked to how the
   symmetric key is obtained.

   We restrict the set of legal content encryption algorithms to those
   which support authentication both of the content and additional data.
   The encryption process will generate some type of authentication
   value, but that value may be either explicit or implicit in terms of
   the algorithm definition.  For simplicity sake, the authentication
   code will normally be defined as being appended to the cipher text
   stream.  The basic structure becomes:

   ciphertext = Encrypt(message content, key, additional data)

   valid, message content = Decrypt(cipher text, key, additional data)


   Most AEAD algorithms are logically defined as returning the message
   content only if the decryption is valid.  Many but not all
   implementations will follow this convention.  The message content
   MUST NOT be used if the decryption does not validate.

4.1.  ChaCha20 and Poly1305

   ChaCha20 and Poly1305 combined together is a new AEAD mode that is
   defined in [RFC7539].  This is a new algorithm defined to be a cipher
   which is not AES and thus would not suffer from any future weaknesses
   found in AES.  These cryptographic functions are designed to be fast
   in software only implementations.

   The ChaCha20/Poly1305 AEAD construction defined in [RFC7539] has no
   parameterization.  It takes a 256-bit key and an a 96-bit nonce as
   well as the plain text and additional data as inputs and produces the
   cipher text as an option.  We define one algorithm identifier for
   this algorithm in Table 3.

     | name              | value | description                      |
     +-------------------+-------+----------------------------------+

     +-------------------+-------+----------------------------------+

                   Table 3: Algorithm Value for AES-GCM

   Keys may be obtained either from a key structure or from a recipient
   structure.  If the key obtained from a key structure, the key type
   MUST be 'Symmetric'.  Implementations creating and validating MAC
   values MUST validate that the key type, key length and algorithm are
   correct and appropriate for the entities involved.

4.1.1.  Security Considerations

   The pair of key, nonce MUST be unique for every invocation of the
   algorithm.  Nonce counters are considered to be an acceptable way of
   ensuring that they are unique.

5.  Key Derivation Functions (KDF)

   Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) are used to take some secret value
   and generate a different one.  The original secret values come in
   three basic flavors:

   o  Secrets which are uniformly random: This is the type of secret
      which is created by a good random number generator.

   o  Secrets which are not uniformly random: This is type of secret
      which is created by operations like key agreement.

   o  Secrets which are not random: This is the type of secret that
      people generate for things like passwords.

   General KDF functions work well with the first type of secret, can do
   reasonable well with the second type of secret and generally do
   poorly with the last type of secret.  None of the KDF functions in
   this section are designed to deal with the type of secrets that are
   used for passwords.  Functions like PBSE2 [RFC2898] need to be used
   for that type of secret.

   Many functions are going to handle the first two type of secrets
   differently.  The KDF function defined in [HKDF] can use different
   underlying constructions if the secret is uniformly random than if
   the secret is not uniformly random.  This is reflected in the set of
   algorithms defined for HKDF.

   When using KDF functions, one component that is generally included is
   context information.  Context information is used to allow for
   different keying information to be derived from the same secret.  The
   use of context based keying material is considered to be a good
   security practice.  This document defines a single context structure
   and a single KDF function.

6.  Recipient Algorithm Classes

   Recipient algorithms can be defined into a number of different
   classes.  COSE has the ability to support many classes of recipient
   algorithms.  In this section, a number of classes are listed and then
   a set of algorithms are specified for each of the classes.  The names
   of the recipient algorithm classes used here are the same as are
   defined in [RFC7517].  Other specifications use different terms for
   the recipient algorithm classes or do not support some of our
   recipient algorithm classes.

6.1.  Direct Encryption

   The direct encryption class algorithms share a secret between the
   sender and the recipient that is used either directly or after
   manipulation as the content key.  When direct encryption mode is
   used, it MUST be the only mode used on the message.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field MUST be a zero length item if it is not used
      in the computation of the content key.

   o  The 'alg' parameter MUST be present.

   o  A parameter identifying the shared secret SHOULD be present.

   o  The 'ciphertext' field MUST be a zero length item.

   o  The 'recipients' field MUST be absent.

6.1.1.  Direct Key with KDF

   These recipient algorithms take a common shared secret between the
   two parties and applies the HKDF function using the context structure
   defined in [CONTEXT] to transform the shared secret into the
   necessary key.  Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the partyU
   'nonce' parameter of the context structure MUST be present.  This
   parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically, the
   requirement is that it be a unique value for the key pair in
   question.

   If the salt/nonce value is generated randomly, then it is suggested
   that the length of the random value be the same length as the hash
   function underlying HKDF.  While there is no way to guarantee that it
   will be unique, there is a high probability that it will be unique.
   If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be
   guaranteed to be unique and thus there is no length requirement.

   A new IV must be used if the same key is used in more than one
   message.  The IV can be modified in a predictable manner, a random
   manner or an unpredictable manner.  One unpredictable manner that can
   be used is to use the HKDF function to generate the IV.  If HKDF is
   used for generating the IV, the algorithm identifier is set to "IV-
   GENERATION".

   When these algorithms are used, the key type MUST be 'symmetric'.

                            Table 4: Direct Key

6.1.1.1.  Security Considerations

   The shared secret need to have some method to be regularly updated
   over time.  The shared secret is forming the basis of trust, although
   not used directly it should still be subject to scheduled rotation.

6.2.  Key Wrapping

   In key wrapping mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is
   then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the
   recipient.  All of the currently defined key wrapping algorithms for
   JOSE (and thus for COSE) are AE algorithms.  Key wrapping mode is
   considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any
   capability for doing random key generation.  This is because the
   shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data has some
   degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field MUST be absent if the key wrap algorithm is
      an AE algorithm.

   o  The 'recipients' field is normally absent, but can be used.
      Applications MUST deal with a recipients field present, not being
      able to decrypt that recipient is an acceptable way of dealing
      with it.  Failing to process the message is not an acceptable way
      of dealing with it.

   o  The plain text to be encrypted is the key from next layer down
      (usually the content layer).

   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the shared
      secret.

6.3.  Key Encryption

   Key Encryption mode is also called key transport mode in some
   standards.  Key Encryption mode differs from Key Wrap mode in that it
   uses an asymmetric encryption algorithm rather than a symmetric
   encryption algorithm to protect the key.  This document defines one
   Key Encryption mode algorithm.

   When using a key encryption algorithm, the COSE_encrypt structure for
   the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field MUST be absent.

   o  The plain text to be encrypted is the key from next layer down
      (usually the content layer).

   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the
      asymmetric key.

6.3.1.  RSAES-OAEP

   RSAES-OAEP is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm.  The defintion
   of RSAEA-OAEP can be find in Section 7.1 of [RFC3447].  The algorithm
   is parameterized using a masking generation function (mgf), a hash
   function (h) and encoding parameters (P).  For the algorithm
   identifiers defined in this section:

   o  mgf is always set to MFG1 from [RFC3447] and uses the same hash
      function as h.

   o  P is always set to the empty octet string.

   Table 5 summarizes the rest of the values.

                   Table 5: RSAES-OAEP Algorithm Values

   The key type MUST be 'RSA'.

6.3.1.1.  Security Considerations for RSAES-OAEP

   A key size of 2048 bits or larger MUST be used with these algorithms.
   This key size corresponds roughly to the same strength as provided by
   a 128-bit symmetric encryption algorithm.

   It is highly recommended that checks on the key length be done before
   starting a decryption operation.  One potential denial of service
   operation is to provide encrypted objects using either abnormally
   long or oddly sized RSA modulus values.  Implementations SHOULD be
   able to encrypt and decrypt with modulus between 2048 and 16K bits in
   length.  Applications can impose additional restrictions on the
   length of the modulus.

6.4.  Direct Key Agreement

   The 'direct key agreement' class of recipient algorithms uses a key
   agreement method to create a shared secret.  A KDF is then applied to
   the shared secret to derive a key to be used in protecting the data.
   This key is normally used as a CEK or MAC key, but could be used for
   other purposes if more than two layers are in use (see [THREE-LAYER]
   ).

   The most commonly used key agreement algorithm used is Diffie-
   Hellman, but other variants exist.  Since COSE is designed for a
   store and forward environment rather than an on-line environment,
   many of the DH variants cannot be used as the receiver of the message
   cannot provide any key material.  One side-effect of this is that
   perfect forward security is not achievable, a static key will always
   be used for the receiver of the COSE message.

   Two variants of DH that are easily supported are:

      - Ephemeral-Static DH: where the sender of the message creates a
      one time DH key and uses a static key for the recipient.  The use

      of the ephemeral sender key means that no additional random input
      is needed as this is randomly generated for each message.

      Static-Static DH: where a static key is used for both the sender
      and the recipient.  The use of static keys allows for recipient to
      get a weak version of data origination for the message.  When
      static-static key agreement is used, then some piece of unique
      data is require to ensure that a different key is created for each
      message

   In this specification, both variants are specified.  This has been
   done to provide the weak data origination option for use with MAC
   operations.

   When direct key agreement mode is used, there MUST be only one
   recipient in the message.  This method creates the key directly and
   that makes it difficult to mix with additional recipients.  If
   multiple recipients are needed, then the version with key wrap needs
   to be used.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field MUST be absent.

   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the
      recipient's asymmetric key.

   o  The 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'epk' parameter.

6.4.1.  ECDH

   The basic mathematics for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman can be found
   in [RFC6090].  Two new curves have been defined in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].

   ECDH is parameterized by the following:

   o  Curve Type/Curve: The curve selected controls not only the size of
      the shared secret, but the mathematics for computing the shared
      secret.  The curve selected also controls how a point in the curve
      is represented and what happens for the identity points on the
      curve.  In this specification we allow for a number of different
      curves to be used.  The curves are defined in Table 9.
      Since the only the math is changed by changing the curve, the
      curve is not fixed for any of the algorithm identifiers we define,
      instead it is defined by the points used.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax          October 2015


   o  Ephemeral-static or static-static: The key agreement process may
      be done using either a static or an ephemeral key at the senders
      side.  When using ephemeral keys, the sender MUST generate a new
      ephemeral key for every key agreement operation.  The ephemeral
      key is placed in in the 'ephemeral key' parameter and MUST be
      present for all algorithm identifiers which use ephemeral keys.
      When using static keys, the sender MUST either generate a new
      random value placed in either in the KDF parameters or the context
      structure.  For the KDF functions used, this means either in the
      'salt' parameter for HKDF [HKDF_Alg_Params]) or in in the 'PartyU
      nonce' parameter for the context struture
      ([KDF_Context_Alg_Params]) MUST be present.  (Both may be present
      if desired.)  The value in the parameter MUST be unique for the
      key pair being used.  It is acceptable to use a global counter
      which is incremented for every static-static operation and use the
      resulting value.  When using static keys, the static key needs to
      be identified to the recipient.  The static key can be identified
      either by providing the key ('static key') or by providing a key
      identifier for the static key ('static key id').  Both of these
      parameters are defined in Table 7

   o  Key derivation algorithm: The result of an ECDH key agreement
      process does not provide a uniformly random secret, as such it
      needs to be run through a KDF in order to produce a usable key.
      Processing the secret through a KDF also allows for the
      introduction of both context material, how the key is going to be
      used, and one time material in the even to of a static-static key
      agreement.

   o  Key Wrap algorithm: The key wrap algorithm can be 'none' if the
      result of the KDF is going to be used as the key directly.  This
      option, along with static-static, should be used if knowledge
      about the sender is desired.  If 'none' is used then the content
      layer encryption algorithm size is value fed to the context
      structure.  Support is also provided for any of the key wrap
      algorithms defined in section [KEY_WRAP_ALGS].  If one of these
      options is used, the input key size to the key wrap algorithm is
      the value fed into the context structure as the key size.

   The set of algorithms direct ECDH defined in this document are found
   in Table 6.

   This document defines these algorithms to be used with the curves
   P-256, P-384, P-521, X25519 and X448.  Implementations MUST verify
   that the key type and curve are correct, different curves are
   restricted to different key types.  Implementations MUST verify that
   the curve and algorithm are appropriate for the entities involved.

6.5.  Key Agreement with KDF

   Key Agreement with Key Wrapping uses a randomly generated CEK.  The
   CEK is then encrypted using a Key Wrapping algorithm and a key
   derived from the shared secret computed by the key agreement
   algorithm.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field is fed into the KDF context structure.

   o  The plain text to be encrypted is the key from next layer down
      (usually the content layer).

   o  The 'alg' parameter MUST be present in the layer.

   o  A parameter identifying the recipient's key SHOULD be present.  A
      parameter identifying the senders key SHOULD be present.

7.  Keys

   The COSE_Key object defines a way to hold a single key object, it is
   still required that the members of individual key types be defined.
   This section of the document is where we define an initial set of
   members for specific key types.

   For each of the key types, we define both public and private members.
   The public members are what is transmitted to others for their usage.
   We define private members mainly for the purpose of archival of keys
   by individuals.  However, there are some circumstances where private
   keys may be distributed by various entities in a protocol.  Examples
   include: Entities which have poor random number generation.

   Centralized key creation for multi-cast type operations.  Protocols
   where a shared secret is used as a bearer token for authorization
   purposes.

   Key types are identified by the 'kty' member of the COSE_Key object.
   In this document we define four values for the member.

7.1.  Elliptic Curve Keys

   Two different key structures are being defined for Elliptic Curve
   keys.  One version uses both an x and a y coordinate, potentially
   with point compression.  This is the traditional EC point
   representation that is used in [RFC5480].  The other version uses
   only the x coordinate as the y coordinate is either to be recomputed
   or not needed for the key agreement operation.  An example of this is
   Curve25519 [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].  [CREF3]

                            Table 9: EC Curves

7.1.1.  Single Coordinate Curves

   One class of Elliptic Curve mathematics allows for a point to be
   completely defined using the curve and the x coordinate of the point
   on the curve.  The two curves that are initially setup to use is
   point format are Curve 25519 and Curve 448 which are defined in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].

   For EC keys with only the x coordinates, the 'kty' member is set to 1
   (EC1).  The key parameters defined in this section are summarized in
   Table 10.  The members that are defined for this key type are:

   crv  contains an identifier of the curve to be used with the key.
      [CREF4] The curves defined in this document for this key type can
      be found in Table 9.  Other curves may be registered in the future
      and private curves can be used as well.

   x  contains the x coordinate for the EC point.  The octet string
      represents a little-endian encoding of x.

   d  contains the private key.

   For public keys, it is REQUIRED that 'crv' and 'x' be present in the
   structure.  For private keys, it is REQUIRED that 'crv' and 'd' be
   present in the structure.  For private keys, it is RECOMMENDED that
   'x' also be present, but it can be recomputed from the required
   elements and omitting it saves on space.

7.2.  RSA Keys

   This document defines a key structure for both the public and private
   halves of RSA keys.  Together, an RSA public key and an RSA private
   key form an RSA key pair.  [CREF5]

   The document also provides support for the so-called "multi-prime"
   RSA where the modulus may have more than two prime factors.  The
   benefit of multi-prime RSA is lower computational cost for the
   decryption and signature primitives.  For a discussion on how multi-
   prime affects the security of RSA crypto-systems, the reader is
   referred to [MultiPrimeRSA].

   This document follows the naming convention of [RFC3447] for the
   naming of the fields of an RSA public or private key.  The table
   Table 11 provides a summary of the label values and the types
   associated with each of those labels.  The requirements for fields
   for RSA keys are as follows:

   o  For all keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.

   o  For public keys, the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present.  All
      other fields defined in Table 11 MUST be absent.

   o  For private keys with two primes, the fields 'other', 'r_i', 'd_i'
      and 't_i' MUST be absent, all other fields MUST be present.

   o  For private keys with more than two primes, all fields MUST be
      present.  For the third to nth primes, each of the primes is
      represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i'.
      The field 'other' is an array of those maps.

   2.  MAC messages with more than one recipient means one cannot figure
       out who sent the message

   3.  Use of direct key with other recipient structures hands the key
       to other recipients.

   4.  Use of direct ECDH direct encryption is easy for people to leak
       information on if there are other recipients in the message.

   5.  Considerations about protected vs unprotected header fields.

   6.  Need to verify that: 1) the kty field of the key matches the key
       and algorithm being used.  2) that the kty field needs to be
       included in the trust decision as well as the other key fields.
       3) that the algorithm be included in the trust decision.

Appendix A.  CDDL Grammar

   For people who prefer using a formal language to describe the syntax
   of the CBOR, in this section a CDDL grammar is given that corresponds
   to [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl].  This grammar is
   informational, in the event of differences between this grammar and
   the prose, the prose is considered to be authorative.

   The collected CDDL can be extracted from the XML version of this
   document via the following XPath expression below.  (Depending on the
   XPath evaluator one is using, it may be necessary to deal with &gt;
   as an entity.)


   //artwork[@type='CDDL']/text()

Appendix B.  Examples

   The examples can be found at https://github.com/cose-wg/Examples.
   The file names in each section correspond the the same file names in
   the repository.  I am currently still in the process of getting the
   examples up there along with some control information for people to
   be able to check and reproduce the examples.

   Examples may have some features that are in questions but not yet
   incorporated in the document.

   To make it easier to read, the examples are presented using the
   CBOR's diagnostic notation rather than a binary dump.  A ruby based
   tool exists to convert between a number of formats.  This tool can be
   installed with the command line:

           gem install cbor-diag

   The diagnostic notation can be converted into binary files using the
   following command line:

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax          October 2015


Editorial Comments

[CREF1] JLS: I have not gone through the document to determine what
        needs to be here yet.  We mostly want to grab terms which are
        used in unusual ways or are not generally understood.

[CREF2] JLS: Do we want/need to support this?  JOSE did it mainly to
        support the encryption of private keys.

[CREF3] Ilari: Check to see what the curves are renamed to during final
        publishing.  It appears to be X25519 now.

[CREF4] JLS: Do we create a registry for curves?  Is is the same
        registry for both EC1 and EC2?

[CREF5] JLS: Looking at the CBOR specification, the bstr that we are
        looking in our table below should most likely be specified as
        big numbers rather than as binary strings.  This means that we
        would use the tag 6.2 instead.  From my reading of the
        specification, there is no difference in the encoded size of the
        resulting output.  The specification of bignum does explicitly
        allow for integers encoded with leading zeros.
