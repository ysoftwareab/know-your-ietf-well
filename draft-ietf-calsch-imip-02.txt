Abstract


   This document specifies a binding from the iCalendar Transport-
   independent Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to Internet email-based
   transports. Calendaring entries defined by the iCalendar Object Model
   [ICAL] are composed using constructs from [RFC-822], [RFC-2045],
   [RFC-2046], [RFC-2047], [RFC-2048] and [RFC-2049].

   This document is based on the calendaring and scheduling model
   defined by [ICMS].

   This document is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF) Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group.
   More information about the IETF CALSCH working group activities can
   be found on the IMC website at http://www.imc.org, the IETF website
   at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html. Refer to
   the references within this document for further information on how to
   access these various documents.

   Distribution of this document is unlimited. Comments and suggestions
   for improvement should be sent to the authors.

1  Introduction


   This binding document provides the transport specific information
   necessary convey iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol [ITIP] over MIME as defined in [RFC-822] and [RFC-2045].

1.1 Related Memos


   Implementors will need to be familar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards.

   This document - specifies an Internet email binding for [ITIP].

   [ICMS] - specifies a common terminology and abstract;

   [ICAL] - specifies a core specification of objects, data types,
   properties and property parameters;

   [ITIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling
   between different implementations;

   [IRIP] - specifies an Internet real time protocol binding for [ITIP].

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

1.2 Formatting Conventions


   The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in propose. In order
   to refer to elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core
   object or interoperability protocol defined in [ICMS], [ICAL] and
   [ITIP] some formatting conventions have been used.

   Calendaring and scheduling roles defined by [ICMS] are referred to in
   quoted-strings of text with the first character of each word in upper
   case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User"
   within the scheduling protocol defined by [ITIP]

   Calendar components defined by [ICAL] are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start
   with the letter "V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event
   calendar component, "VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component
   and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily journal calendar component.

   Scheduling methods defined by [ITIP] are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to
   the method for requesting a scheduling calendar component be created
   or modified, "REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request
   uses to update their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar
   component.

Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                            October 24, 1997

   Properties defined by [ICAL] are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
   "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey
   the calendar address of a calendar user.

   Property parameters defined by [ICAL] are referred to with lower
   case, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "parameter". For
   example, "VALUE" parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter
   used to override the default data type for a property value.

1.3 Terminology


   The email terms used in this memo are defined in [RFC-822] and [RFC-
   2045]. The calendaring and scheduling terms used in this memo are
   defined in [ICMS], [ICAL] and [ITIP]

2  MIME Message Format Binding


   This section defines the message binding to the MIME electronic mail
   transport.

   The sections below refer to the "originator" and the "respondent" of
   an iMIP message. Typically, the originator is the owner or oganizer
   of an event. The respondent is an attendee of the event.

   In a well-organized email message the Reply-To header contains the
   email address of the originator or respondent of an event. However,
   this cannot be guaranteed as Mail User Agents (MUA) are not required
   to enforce iMIP semantics.

2.1 MIME Media Type


   A MIME entity containing content information formatted according to
   this design document will be referenced as a "text/calendar" content
   type. It is assumed that this content type will be transported
   through a MIME electronic mail transport.

2.2 Security


   This section addresses several aspects of security including
   Authentication, Authorization and Confidentiality. Authentication and
   confidentiality can be achieved using RFC 1847 which specifies the
   Security Multiparts for MIME. This framework defines new content
   types and subtypes of multipart: signed and encrypted. Each contains
   two body parts: one for the protected data and another for the
   control information necessary to remove the protection.

2.2.1   Authorization


   Per the [ICSM], only the organizer has authorization to modify or
   cancel calendar entries they organize. That is, spoof@xyz.com should
   not be able to modify or cancel a meeting that was organized by



Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          3                   Expires May 1998


Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                            October 24, 1997

   a@xyz.com. Furthermore, only the respondent has the authorization to
   indicate their status to the organizer. That is, spoof@xyz.com should
   not be able to tell the organizer that b@xyz.com declines a meeting
   invitation.

   Hence, iMIP implementations must verify the authenticity of the
   sender of an iCalendar object before taking any action. This could be
   done by utilizing a Multipart/signed implementation of either
   PGP/MIME or S/MIME.

2.2.2   Authentication


   Authentication can be performed using an implementation of RFC 1847
   Multipart/signed that supports public/private key certificates.
   However, since most MUAs provide for the forwarding of messages, the
   organizer of an event and the sender of the message may be different.
   Therefore authentication may not be possible.

2.2.3   Confidentiality


   To ensure confidentiality using iMIP implementations should utilize
   RFC 1847 compliant encryption. The protocol does not restrict a CUA
   from forwarding Requests or Responses to other users or agents.

2.3 RFC 822 Addresses


   The calendar address specified within the "ATTENDEE" property in an
   iCalendar object MUST be a fully qualified, RFC 822 address
   specification for the corresponding "Owner", "Organizer" or
   "Attendee" of the "VEVENT" or "VTODO". The address MUST be the RFC
   822 address for the calendaring and scheduling mailbox for the
   attendee.

   For purposes of authentication and authorization the RFC 822 "Sender"
   and "Reply-to" value MUST be the same as the address value for the
   "Organizer". Because [ITIP] does not preclude "Attendees" from
   forwarding "VEVENTS" or "VTODOS" to others, the RFC-822 "Sender"
   value may not equal that of the organizer. In these cases,
   authentication cannot be verified. Additionally, the "Organizer"
   cannot be inferred by the RFC-822 "Sender" or "Reply-to" values.
   Instead, it MUST be derived by opening the proper text/calendar MIME
   body part.

2.4 Content Type


   A MIME body part containing content information that conforms to this
   design document MUST have a Content-Type value of "text/calendar".
   The content type header field MUST also include the type parameter
   "method". The parameter value MUST be one of the message types
   defined by this method. The value MUST also be the same as the value
   of the METHOD calendar property within the iCalendar object. This
   means that if a MIME message containing multiple iCalendar objects
   with different method values, then they must be further encapsulated

Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                            October 24, 1997

   with a "multipart/mixed" MIME entity. This will allow each of the
   iCalendar objects to be encapsulated within their own "text/calendar"
   MIME entity.

   A CHARSET parameter MUST be present when the "text/calendar" is used.
   RFC-2046 discusses the selection of an appropriate CHARSET value.

   The optional Content-Type COMPONENT parameter defines the iCalendar
   component type contained within the iCalendar object.

   The following is an example of this header field with a value that
   indicates an event message.

        Content-Type:text/calendar; method=request; charset=UTF-8;
              component=vevent

   The "text/calendar" content type allows for the scheduling message
   type to be included in a MIME message with other content information
   (i.e., multipart/mixed) or included in a MIME message with a clear-
   text, human-readable form of the scheduling message (i.e.,
   multipart/alternative).

   In order to permit the information in the scheduling message to be
   understood by MIME user agents (UA) that do not support the
   text/calendar content type, scheduling messages should be sent with
   an alternative, human-readable form of the information.

2.5 Content-Transfer-Encoding


   Note that the default character set for iCalendar objects is UTF-8. A
   transfer encoding SHOULD be used for iCalendar objects containing any
   characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set.

        Content-Transfer-Encoding:quoted-printable

3  Security Considerations


   [ITIP] details the security threats that applications must address
   when implementing ITIP.  Two spoofing threats are identified:
   Spoofing the "Organizer", and Spoofing an "Attendee". To address
   these threats, the originator of an iCalendar object must be
   authenticated by a recipient. Once authenticated, a determination can
   be made as to whether or not the originator is authorized to perform
   the requested operation. Applications requiring protection from this
   type of threat SHOULD provide a mechanism based on Security
   Multiparts for MIME [RFC1847] to authenticate the originator of the
   iCalendar object. The steps are described  below:

   1. The iCalendar object must be signed by the "Organizer" sending an
   update or the "Attendee" sending a reply.

   2.  Using the RFC1847-compliant security mechanism, determine who
   signed the iCalendar object. This is the "signer". Note that the

Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                            October 24, 1997

   signer is not necessarily the person sending an e-mail message.  An
   e-mail message can be forwarded.

   3. Correlate the "signer" to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar
   object.  If the signer cannot be correlated to an "ATTENDEE"
   property, ignore the message.

   4. Determine whether or not the "ATTENDEE" is authorized to perform
   the operation. ITIP states:

   (a) the "Organizer" is the only person authorized to make changes
       to an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" calendar component
       and redistribute the updates to the "Attendees"

   (b) an "Attendee" of a "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" calendar
       component is the only person authorized to update any parameter
       associated with their "ATTENDEE" property and send it to the
       "Organizer"

   If these conditions are not met, ignore the message.

   5. If all the above conditions are met, the message can be processed.
