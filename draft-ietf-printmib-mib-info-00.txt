     1.  Introduction

     1.1.  Network Printing Environment

     The management of producing a printed document, in any computer
     environment, is a complex subject. Basically, the task can be
     divided into two overlapping pieces, the management of printing and
     the  management of the printer. Printing encompasses the entire
     process of producing a printed document from generation of the file
     to be printed, selection of a printer, choosing printing properties
     , routing, queuing, resource management, scheduling, and final
     printing including notifying the user.  Most of the printing
     process is outside the scope of the model presented here; only the
     management of the printer is covered.

     1.2.  Printer Device Overview

     A printer is the physical device that takes media from an input
     source, produces marks on that media according to some page
     description or page control language and puts the result in some
     output destination, possibly with finishing applied. Printers are
     complex devices that consume supplies, produce waste and have
     mechanical problems. In the management of the physical printing
     device the description, status and alert information concerning the
     printer and its various subparts has to be made available to the
     management application so that it can be reported to the end user,
     key operators for the replenishment of supplies or the repair or
     maintenance of the device. The information needed in the management
     of the physical printer and the management of a printing job
     overlap highly and many of the tasks in each management area
     require the same or similar information.

     1.3.  Categories of Printer Information

     Information about printers is classified into three basic
     categories: descriptions, status and alerts.

     1.3.1.  Descriptions

     Descriptions convey information about the configuration and
     capabilities of the printer and its various sub-units. This
     information is largely static information and does not generally
     change during the operation of the system but may change as the
     printer is repaired, reconfigured or upgraded. The descriptions are
     one part of the visible state of the printer where state means the
     condition of being of the printer at any point in time.

     1.3.2.  Status

     Status is the information regarding the current operating state of
     the printer and its various sub-units. Status is the rest of the
     visible state of the printer. As an example of the use of status, a
     management application must be able to determine if the various

     INTERNET-DRAFT

     sub- units are ready to print or are in some state that prevents
     printing or may prevent printing in the future.

     1.3.3.  Alerts

     An Alert is the representation of a reportable event in the
     printer. An event is a change in the state of the printer. Some of
     those state changes are of interest to a management application and
     are therefore reportable. Typically, these are the events that
     affect the printer's ability to print. Alerts usually occur
     asynchronously to the operation of the computer system(s) to which
     the printer is attached. For convenience below, "alert" will be
     used for both the event caused by a change in the printer's state
     and for the representation of that event.

     Alerts can be classified into two basic categories, critical and
     non-critical.  A critical alert is one that is triggered by entry
     into a state in which the printer is stopped and printing can not
     continue until the condition that caused critical alert is
     eliminated. "Out of paper", "toner empty" and "output bin full" are
     examples of critical alerts. Non-critical alerts are triggered by
     those events that enter a state in which printing is not stopped.
     Such a non-critical state may, at some future time, lead to a state
     in which printing may be stopped.  Examples of this kind of non-
     critical alerts are "input media low", "toner low" and "output bin
     nearly full". Or, a non-critical alert may simply provide
     information, such as signaling a configuration changed in the
     printer.

     Description, status and alert information about the printer can be
     thought of as a data base describing the printer. The management
     application for a printer will want to view the printer data base
     differently depending on how and for what purposes the information
     in the data base is needed.

     2.  Printer Model

     In order to accomplish the management of the printer, an abstract
     model of the printer is needed to represent the sub-units from
     which the printer is composed. A printer can be described as
     consisting of 13 types of sub-units. It is important to note that
     the sub-units of a printer do not necessarily relate directly to
     any physically identifiable mechanism. Sub-units can also be a set
     of definable logical processes, such as interpreters for page
     description languages or command processors that set various
     operating modes of the printer.


        Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the printer and its basic 13
     sub-
        units.

     2.1.  Overview of the Printer Model

     The model has three basic parts: (1) the flow of a print file into
     an interpreter and onto the marker, (2) the flow of media through
     the marker and (3) the auxiliary sub-units that control and
     facilitate the two prior flows.  The flow of the print data comes
     through a physical connection on which some form of transport
     protocol stack is running.  The data provided by the transport
     protocol (interface) appears on a channel which is the input to an
     interpreter. The interpreter converts the print data into a form
     suitable for marking on the media.

     The media resides in Input sub-units from which the media is
     selected and then transported via a Media Path first to a Marking
     sub-unit and then onto an Output sub-unit with (optionally) some
     finishing operations being performed.  The auxiliary sub-units
     facilitate control of the printer, inquiry/control of the operator
     panel, reporting of alerts, and the adaptation of the printer to
     various natural languages and characters sets. All the software
     sub-units run on the System Controller which represents the
     processor, memory and storage systems of the Printer.  Each of the
     sub-units is discussed in more detail below.

     All of the sub-units other than the Alerts report only state
     information, either a description or a status. The Alerts sub-unit
     reports event information.

     2.2.  Printer Sub-Units

     A printer is composed of 13 types of sub-units, called groups.  The
     following sections describe the different types of sub-units.

     2.2.1.  General Printer

     The general printer sub-unit is responsible for the overall control
     and status of the printer. There is exactly one general printer
     sub-unit in a printer. The general printer sub-unit is represented
     by the General Printer Group in the model. In addition to the
     providing the status of the whole printer and allowing the printer
     to be reset, this Group provides information on the status of the
     packaging of the printer, in particular, the covers. The general
     printer sub-unit is usually implemented on the system controller.

     The localization portion of the general printer sub-unit is
     responsible for identifying the natural language, country, and
     character set in which character strings are expressed. There may
     be one or more localizations supported per printer. The available
     localizations are represented by the Localization table.





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                            13

     Expires June 3, 1997


     Localization is only performed on those strings in the MIB that are
     explicitly marked as being localized.  All other character strings
     are returned in ASCII.

     The character set portion of the general printer sub-unit is
     responsible for identifying the possible character sets that are
     used by the interpreters, the operator console, and in network
     management requests for display objects. There may be one or more
     character sets per printer.  The understood character sets are
     represented by the Character Set Table.

     2.2.2.  Inputs

     Input sub-units are mechanisms that feed media to be marked on into
     the printer. A printer contains one or more input sub-units. These
     are represented by the Input Group in the model. The model does not
     distinguish fixed input bins from removable trays, except to report
     when a removable tray has been removed.

     There are as many input sub-units as there are distinctly
     selectable input "addresses".  For example, if a tray has an option
     for manually feeding paper as well as automatically feeding from
     the tray, then this is two input sub-units if these two sources can
     be (must be) separately selected and is one input sub-unit if
     putting a sheet in the manual feed slot overrides feeding from the
     contents of the tray; that is, in the second case there is no way
     to separately select or address the manual feed slot.

     2.2.3.  Media

     An input sub-unit can hold one or more instances of the media on
     which marking is to be done. Typically, there is a large set of
     possible media that can be associated with an input. The Media
     Group is an extension of the Input Group which represents that
     media that is in an input sub-unit. The Media Group only describes
     the current contents of each input and not the possible content of
     the input sub-unit.

     2.2.4.  Outputs

     Output sub-units are mechanisms that receive media that has been
     marked on. A printer contains one or more output mechanisms. These
     are represented by the Output Group in the model. The model does
     not distinguish fixed output bins from removable output bins,
     except to report when a removable bin has been removed.

     There are as many output sub-units as there are distinctly
     selectable output "addresses".  Output sub-units can be addressed
     in two different ways: (1) as a set of "mailboxes" which are
     addressed by a specific mailbox selector such as a bin number or a
     bin name, or (2) as a set of "slots" into which multiple copies are
     collated. Sometimes both modes of using the output sub-units can be

     INTERNET-DRAFT                                            14

     INTERNET-DRAFT

     used on the same printer.  All that is important from the viewpoint
     of the model is that the output units can be separately selected.

     2.2.5.  Finishers

     A finisher is a sub-unit that performs some operations on the media
     other than marking.  The finisher sub-units are represented by the
     Finisher Group in the model.  Some examples of finishing processes
     are stapling, punching, binding, inserting, or folding.  Finishing
     processes may have supplies associated with the process.  Stapling,
     binding, and punching are examples of processes that have supplies.
     A printer may have more than one finishing sub-unit and each
     finishing sub-unit may be associated with one or more output sub-
     units. Finishers are not described in this MIB.

     The exact interaction and sequencing between an output device and
     its associated finisher is not specified by the model. It depends
     on the type of finishing process and the exact implementation of
     the printer system. This standard allows for the logical
     association of a finishing process with an output device but does
     not put any restrictions on the exact sequence or interaction with
     the associated output device. The output and finisher sub-units may
     or may not be separate identifiable physical mechanisms depending
     on the exact implementation of a printer.  In addition, a single
     output device may be associated with multiple finishing sub-units
     and a single finishing sub-unit may be associated with multiple
     output devices.


     2.2.6.  Markers

     A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the print media.
     The marker sub-units and their associated supplies are represented
     by the Marker Group in the model. A printer can contain one or more
     marking mechanisms.  Some examples of multiple marker sub-units
     are: a printer with separate markers for normal and magnetic ink or
     an imagesetter that can output to both a proofing device and final
     film. Each marking device can have its own set of  characteristics
     associated with it, such as marking technology and resolution.

     In this model the marker sub-unit is viewed as very generalized and
     encompasses all aspects of a marking process. For example, in a
     xerographic process, the marking process as well as the fusing
     process would be included in the generalized concept of the marker.
     With the generalized concept of a marking process, the concept of
     multiple marking supplies associated with a single marking sub-unit
     results. For example, in the xerographic process, there is not only
     a supply of toner, but there can also be other supplies such as a
     fuser supply (e.g., fuser oil) that can be consumed and replaced
     separately. In addition there can be multiple supplies of toner for
     a single marker device,as in a color process.

     2.2.7.  Media Paths

     The media paths encompass the mechanisms in the printer that move
     the media through the printer and connect all other media related
     sub-units: inputs, outputs, markers and finishers. A printer
     contains one or more media paths. These are represented by the
     Media Path Group in the model.  The Media Path group has some
     objects that apply to all paths plus a table of the separate media
     paths.

     In general, the design of the media paths determines the maximum
     speed of the printer as well as the maximum media size that the
     printer can handle. Media paths are complex mechanisms and can
     contain many different identifiable sub-mechanisms such as media
     movement devices, media buffers, duplexing units and interlocks.
     Not all of the various sub-mechanisms reside on every media path.
     For example, one media path may provide printing only on one
     surface of the media (a simplex path) and another media path may
     have a sub-mechanism that turns the media over and feeds it a
     second time through the marker sub-unit (a duplex path).  The
     duplex path may even have a buffer sub-mechanism that allows
     multiple copies of the obverse side to be held before the reverse
     side of all the copies are marked.

     2.2.8.  System Controller

     The System Controller is the sub-unit upon which the software
     components of the Printer run. The System Controller is represented
     in the model by the Host MIB. This MIB allows for the specification
     of the processor(s), memory, disk storage, file system and other
     underlying sub-mechanisms of the printer. The controller can range
     from simple single processor systems to multiprocessor systems. In
     addition, controllers can have a full range of resources such as
     hard disks. The printer is modeled to have one system controller
     even though it may have more than one processor and multiple other
     resources associated with it.

     2.2.9.  Interfaces

     An interface is the communications port and associated protocols
     that are responsible for the transport of data to the printer. A
     printer has one or more interface sub-units. The interfaces are
     represented by the Interfaces Group of MIB-II (RFC 1213). Some
     examples of interfaces are serial ports (with little or no
     protocol) and EtherNet ports on which one might run InterNet IP,
     Novell IPX, etc.

     2.2.10.  Print Job Delivery Channels

     The print job delivery channel sub-units identify the independent
     sources of print data (here print data is the information that is
     used to construct printed pages and may have both data and control
     aspects).  A printer may have one or more channels. The channel

     INTERNET-DRAFT                                            16

     INTERNET-DRAFT
     J.R. Turner, Sharp Laboratories of America
     Expires June 3, 1997

     sub-units are represented by the Print Job Delivery Channel Group
     in the Model. Each channel is typically identified by the
     electronic path and service protocol used to deliver print data to
     the printer. A channel sub-unit may be independently enabled
     (allowing print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of
     print data). It has a current Control Language which can be used to
     specify which interpreter is to be used for the print data and to
     query and change environment variables used by the interpreters
     (and SNMP). There is also a default interpreter that is to be used
     if an interpreter is not explicitly specified using the Control
     Language. Print Job Delivery Channel sub-units can, and usually
     are, based on an underlying interface.

     2.2.11.  Interpreters

     The interpreter sub-units are responsible for the conversion of a
     description of intended print instances into images that are to be
     marked on the media. A printer may have one or more interpreters.
     The interpreter sub-units are represented by the Interpreter Group
     in the Model. Each interpreter is generally implemented with
     software running on the System Controller sub-unit. The Interpreter
     Table has one entry per interpreter where the interpreters include
     both Page Description Language (PDL) Interpreters and Control
     Language Interpreters.

     2.2.12.  Console

     Many printers have a console on the printer, the operator console,
     that is used to display and modify the state of the printer.  The
     console can be as simple as a few indicators and switches or as
     complicated as full screen displays and keyboards. There can be at
     most one such console.  This console sub-unit is represented by the
     Console Group in the model.  Although most of the information
     displayed there is also available in the state of the printer as
     represented by the various Groups, it is useful to be able to query
     and modify the operator console remotely.  For example, a
     management application might like to display to its user the
     current message on the operator console of the remote printer or
     the management application user might like to modify the current
     message on the operators console of the remote printer.  As another
     example, one might have a remote application that puts up a pseudo
     console on a workstation screen. Since the rules by which the
     printer state is mapped onto the console and vice versa are not
     standardized, it is not possible to reproduce the console state or
     the action of console buttons and menus. Therefore, the Console
     Group provides access to the console. The operator console is
     usually implemented on the system controller with additional
     hardware for input and display.

     2.2.13.  Alerts

     The alert sub-unit is responsible for detecting reportable events,
     making an entry in the alert table and, if and only if the event is

     INTERNET-DRAFT                                            17

     Expires June 3, 1997

     a critical event, initiating a trap. The exception to this rule is
     when the "alert alert" trap is generated. The alert sub-unit is
     represented by the Alerts Group and, in particular, the Alert
     Table. This table contains information on the severity, sub-unit,
     detailed location within the sub-unit, alert code and description
     of each critical alert that is currently active within the printer.
     Each reportable event causes an entry to be made in the Alert
     Table.

     2.2.13.1.  Status and Alerts

     Summary information about the state of the printer is reported at
     three separate levels: (1) there is the status of the printer as a
     whole reported in the Host MIB, (2) there is the status of various
     sub-units reported in the principle table of the Group that
     represents the sub-unit, and (3) there are alert codes reported in
     the Alert Table.

     2.2.13.2.  Overall Printer Status

     Of the many states a printer can be in, certain states are more
     "interesting" because of the distinct actions they are likely to
     provoke in the administrator.  These states may be applied to the
     printer as a whole, or to a particular sub-unit of the
     printer.These named states are:

     Non Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or
     more sub-units have a non-critical alert active.  For a sub-unit,
     this means that the sub-unit has a non-critical alert active.

     Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or more
     sub-units have a critical alert active.  For a sub-unit, this means
     that the sub-unit has a critical alert active.

     Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable for use (this
     is the same as "broken" or "down" in other terminologies).  A
     trained service person is typically necessary to make it available.
     Busy / Temporarily Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is
     operational but currently occupied with a request for activity. The
     sub-unit will become available without the need of human
     interaction.

     Moving on-line or off-line - The printer is either off-line, in the
     process of moving off-line or in the process of moving back on-
     line; for example on high end printers reloading paper involves a
     transition to off-line to open the paper bin, it is then filled
     and, finally, there is a transition back to on-line as the paper
     bin is repositioned for printing.

     Standby - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable for use because it
     is partially powered down and may need some period of time to
     become fully operational again.  A unit in Standby state shall
     respond to network management requests.

     Available - The printer or subunit is functioning normally.

     Idle - The printer or subunit is not processing any print jobs

     Active - The printer or subunit is working on one or more print
     jobs

     Busy - The printer or subunit is "Active" and has also reached a
     resource threshold whereby it will not accept any new print jobs
     for a finite period of time. The expected next state transition
     from the "busy" state is to the "active" state, implying that
     resources are again available to accept new print jobs.

     The Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514) provides three status objects
     that can be used to describe the status of a printer: (1)
     hrDeviceStatus in the entry in the hrDeviceTable; (2)
     hrPrinterStatus in the hrPrinterTable; and (3)
     hrPrinterDetectedErrorState in the hrPrinterTable.  These objects
     describe many of the states that a printer can be in.  The
     following table shows how the states named above can be recognized
     by inspecting the values of the three printer-related objects in
     the Host MIB:

     Printer     hrDeviceStatus  hrPrinterStatus
     hrPrinterDetectedErrorState

     These named states are only a subset of the possible states - they
     are not an exhaustive list of the possible states.  Nevertheless,
     several things should be noted.  When using these states, it is not
     possible to detect when both critical and non-critical alerts are
     pending - if both are pending, the Critical Alert Active state will
     prevail.  In addition, a printer in the Standby state will be
     represented in the Host MIB with a device status of running(2) and
     a printer status of other(1), a set of states that don't uniquely
     distinguish this important printer state.

     Although the above mapping is workable, it would be improved with a
     few additions to hrDeviceStatus and hrPrinterStatus in the Host
     Resources MIB. In particular, it would be appropriate to add a
     "standby" enumeration to hrDeviceStatus.  Similarly, it would be
     useful to add the following states to hrPrinterStatus: "offline" to
     indicate that reason for the printer being down (instead of having
     to use "other") which allows both "warning" and "offline" to
     indicate going offline and "down" and "offline" to indicate offline
     and "notApplicable" to cover cases, such as "standby", where the
     device state completely describes the state of the device.

     Detailed status per sub-unit is reported in the sub-unit status
     fields.

     Sub-unit status is reported in the entries of the principle table
     in the Group that represents the sub-unit. For sub-units that
     report a status, there is a status column in the table and the
     value of this column is always an integer formed in the following
     way

     The SubUnitStatus is an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct
     values, Availability, Non-Critical, Critical, On-line, and
     Transitioning. These values are:

     For example, an input (tray) that jammed on the next to the last
     page may show a status of 27 (unavailable because broken (3) + a
     critical state (16), jammed, and a noncritical state (8), low
     paper).

     2.2.13.3.  Alert Tables

     The Alert Group consists of a single table in which all active
     alerts are represented.  This section provides and overview of the
     table and a description of how it is managed.  The basic content of
     the alert table is the severity (critical or non-critical) of the
     alert, the Group and entry where a state change caused the alert,
     additional information about the alert (a more detailed location,
     an alert code, and a description), and an indication of the level
     of training needed to service the alert.

     The Alert Table contains some information that is redundant, for
     example that an event has occurred, and some information that is
     only represented in the Alert Table, for example the additional
     information.  A single table was used because a single entry in a
     group could cause more than one alert, for example paper jams in
     more than one place in a media path. Associating the additional
     information with the entry in the affected group would only allow
     one report where associating the additional information with the
     alert makes multiple reports possible. Every time an alert occurs
     in the printer, the printer makes one or more entries into the
     Alert Table. The printer determines if an event is to be classified
     as critical or non-critical. If the severity of the Alert is
     "critical", the printer sends a trap or event notification to the
     host indicating that the table has changed. Whether or not a trap
     is sent, the management application is expected to poll the printer
     on a regular basis and to read and parse the table to determine
     what conditions have changed, in order to provide reliable
     information to the management application user.

     2.2.13.4.  Alert Table Management

     The alert tables are sparsely populated tables. This means the
     tables will only contain entries of the alerts that are currently
     active and the number of rows, or entries in the table will be
     dynamic. More than one event can be added or removed from the event
     tables at a time depending on the implementation of the printer.

     There are basically two kinds of events that produce alerts: binary
     change events and unary change events. Binary change events come in

     INTERNET-DRAFT                                            23

     INTERNET-DRAFT

     pairs: the leading edge event and the trailing edge event. The
     leading edge event enters a state from which there is only one
     exit; for example, going from running to stopped with a paper jam.
     The only exit from this state is fixing the paper jam and it is
     clear when that is accomplished.  The trailing edge event is the
     event which exits the state that was entered by the leading edge
     event; in the example above fixing the paper jam is the trailing
     edge event.

     It is relatively straightforward to manage binary change events in
     the Alert Table. Only the leading edge event makes an entry in the
     alert table.  This entry persists in the Alert Table until the
     trailing edge event occurs at which point this event is signaled by
     the removal of the leading edge event entry in the Alert Table.
     That is, a trailing edge event does not create an entry; it removes
     the corresponding leading edge event. Removing the leading edge
     entry may cause    the unary change event
     "alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry" to be added to the table.  With
     binary change events it is possible to compute the maximum number
     that can occur at the same time and construct an Alert Table that
     would hold that many events. There would be no possibility of table
     overflow and no information about outstanding events would be lost.

     Unfortunately, there are some events that are not binary changes.
     This other category of event, the unary change event, is
     illustrated by the configuration change event. With this kind of
     event the state of the machine has changed, but to a state which is
     (often) just as valid as the state that was left and from which no
     return is necessary.  For example, an operator may change the paper
     that is in the primary input source from letter to legal. At some
     time in the future the paper may be changed back to letter, but it
     might be changed to executive instead.  This is where the problem
     occurs. It is not obvious how long to keep simple change event
     entries in the Alert Table. If they were never removed, the Alert
     Table would continue to grow indefinitely.

     The agent needs to have an algorithm implemented for the management
     of the alert table, especially in the face of combinations of
     binary and simple alerts that would overflow the storage capacity
     of the table.  When the table is full and a new alert needs to be
     added, an old alert needs to be deleted.  The alert to be deleted
     should be chosen using the following rules:


         1. Find a non-critical simple alert and delete it.  If there
     are
            multiple non-critical simple alerts, it is suggested that
     the
            oldest one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical simple
            alerts, then,

         2. Find a non-critical binary alert and delete it.  If there
     are

            multiple non-critical binary alerts, it is suggested that
     the
            oldest one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical binary
            alerts, then,

         3. Find a critical (binary) alert and delete it.  If there are
            multiple critical alerts, it is suggested that the
            oldest one be chosen.  Agent implementors are encouraged to
            provide at least enough storage space for the maximum number
            of critical alerts that could occur simultaneously.  Note
     that
            all critical alerts are binary.

     Note that because the Alert Index is a monotonically increasing
     integer there will be gaps in the values in the table when an alert
     is deleted.  Such gaps can be detected by the management
     application to indicate that the management application may want to
     re-acquire the Printer state and check for state changes it did not
     observe in the Alert Table.

     2.3.  Read-Write Objects

     Some of the objects in the printer MIB report on the existence of
     or amount of a given resource used with the printer.  Some examples
     of such resources are the size and number of sheets of paper in a
     paper tray or the existence of certain output options.  On some
     printers there are sensors that allow these resources to be sensed.
     Other printers, however, lack sensors that can detect (all of) the
     properties of the resource.  Because the printer needs to know of
     the existence or properties of these resources for the printer to
     function properly some other way of providing this information is
     needed.  The chosen way to solve this problem is to allow a
     management application to write into objects which hold the
     descriptive or existence values for printers that cannot sense the
     values.  Thus many of the objects in the MIB are given read-write
     access, but a printer implementation might only permit a management
     operation to change the value if the printer could not sense the
     value itself.  Therefore, the ability to change the value of a
     read-write object may depend on the implementation of the agent.
     Note that even though some objects explicitely state the behaviour
     of conditional ability to change values, any read-write object may
     act that way.

     Generally, an object is given read-write access in the Printer MIB
     specification if:

     1.The object involves installation of a resource that some printers
     cannot themselves detect.  Therefore, external means are needed to
     inform the printer of the installation.  (Here external means
     include using the operator console, or remote management
     application) and



     INTERNET-DRAFT                                            25

     INTERNET-DRAFT
     J.R. Turner, Sharp Laboratories of America
     Expires June 3, 1997

     2.The printer will behave differently if the installation of the
     resource is reported than the printer would if the installation
     were not reported; that is, the object is not to be used as a place
     to put information not used by the printer, i.e., not a "PostIt".
     Another way of saying this is that the printer believes that
     information given it and acts as if the information were true.  For
     example, on a printer that cannot sense the size, if one paper size
     is loaded, but another size is set into the paper size object, then
     the printer will use the size that was set as its current paper
     size in its imaging and paper handling.

     The printer may get hints that it may not know about the existence
     or properties of certain resources.  For example, a paper tray may
     be removed and re-inserted.  When this removal and insertion
     happens, the printer may either assume that a property, such as the
     size of paper in the tray, has not changed or the printer may
     change the value of the associated object to "unknown", as might be
     done for the amount of paper in the tray.  As long as the printer
     acts according to the value in  the object either strategy is
     acceptable.

     It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or not MIB
     object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.
     It is particularly important that the values of the
     prtMarkerLifeCount object persist throughout the lifetime of the
     printer.  Therefore, if the value of any MIB object persists across
     power cycles, then the prtMarkerLifeCount object must also persist.

     2.4.  Enumerations

     Enumerations (enums) are sets of symbolic values defined for use
     with one or more objects.  Some common enumeration sets are
     assigned a symbolic data type name (textual convention).  These
     enumerations are listed at the beginning of this specification.

     2.4.1.  Registering Additional Enumerated Values

     This working group has defined several type of enumerations.  These
     enumerations differ in the method employed to control the addition
     of new enumerations.  Throughout this document, references to
     "enumeration (n)", where n can be 1, 2 or 3 can be found in the
     various tables.  The definitions of these types of enumerations
     are:

     enumeration (1)  All the values are defined in the Printer MIB
     specification (RFC for the Printer MIB).  Additional enumerated
     values require a new RFC. Type 1 enumerations are typically used
     where changes to the enumeration are either unlikely or will have a
     significant impact on the structure of the MIB or implementation of
     the MIB in management applications.

     Some criteria that suggest using a type 1 enumeration are:


     INTERNET-DRAFT                                            26

     INTERNET-DRAFT

     a) the set of values in the enumeration is thought to be known,
     e.g., faceUp and faceDown

     b) the enumeration defines a set of units of measure which must be
     understood by a management application to be able to correctly
     display the value of an object that measurement unit controls; and

     c) the enumeration is tied to the structure of the MIB or the model
     on which the MIB is based, e.g., the prtAlertGroup enumeration is
     tied to the OIDs for the related tables.

     enumeration (2)  An initial set of values are defined in the
     Printer MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values are
     registered after review by this working group. The initial versions
     of the MIB will contain the values registered so far. After the MIB
     is approved, additional values will be registered through IANA
     after approval by this working group. The current set of approved
     values should always be obtained from the IANA registry. Type 2
     enumerations are typically used where it is important to insure
     consistent usage of the enumeration values; that is, to insure that
     the same entity does not get two different enumerations values, or
     two different entities do not get the same enum value.

     enumeration (3)  An initial set of values are defined in the
     Printer MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values are
     registered without working group review.  The initial versions of
     the MIB will contain the values registered so far.  After the MIB
     is approved, additional values will be registered through IANA
     without approval by this working group.  The current set of
     approved values should always be obtained from the IANA registry.
     Type 3 enumerations are used for enumerations that can be extended
     without any controls; an example is the prtMarkerSuppliesType,
     which can be extended as needed by any manufacturer to describe the
     supplies required by a new printer.

     3.  Groups from other MIB Specifications

     This section identifies the grups from other MIBs that shall be
     supported to supplement and complete a printer MIB implementation.
     The section also describes some of the less obvious characteristics
     of the Printer MIB structure that are related to the inclusion of
     these other MIB groups and/or objects.

     The System Controller is represented by the Storage and Device
     Groups of the Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514).  These are the only

     groups that are required to be implemented.  Other Groups (System,

     CodedCharSet ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
           STATUS     current
           DESCRIPTION
              "A coded character set value that specifies both a set of
               characters that may be used and an encoding (as one or
     more
               octets) that is used to represent the characters in the
               set. These values are to be used to identify the encoding
               employed for strings in the MIB where this is not fixed
     by
               the MIB.

               Some objects that allow a choice of coded character set
               are: the prtLocalizationCharacterSet object in the
               LocalizationTable and prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn.
               The prtGeneralCurrentLocalization and
     prtConsoleLocalization
               objects in turn contain the index in the
     LocalizationTable
               of the current localization (country, language, and coded
               character set) of the `description' objects and the
     console,
               respectively.

               The space of the coded character set enumeration has been
               divide into three regions. The first region (3-999)
     consists
               of coded character sets that have been standardized by
     some
               standard setting organization. This region is intended
     for
               standards that do not have subset implementations. The
               second region (1000-1999) is for the Unicode and ISO/IEC
     10646
               coded character sets together with a specification of a
     (set
               of) sub-repetoires that may occur.  The third region
     (>1999)
               is intended for vendor specific coded character sets.

     NOTE: Unicode and ISO 10646 character coded data may be
               processed and stored in either Big Endian (most
     significant
               octet first) or Little Endian (least significant octet
               first) order.  Intel x86, VAX, and Alpha/AXP
     architectures are
               examples of Little Endian processor architectures.
               Furthermore, in environments where either order may
     occur,

               so-called Unicode BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character (which
     is
               ISO 10646 ZERO WIDTH NO BREAK SPACE), coded as FEFF in
     two
               octets and 0000FEFF in four octets is used at the
     beginning
               of the data as a signature to indicate the order of the
               following data (See ISO 10646 Annex F).  Thus either
               ordering and BOM may occur in print data streams sent to
     the
               interpreter.  However, ISO 8824/8825 (ASN.1/BER) used by
               SNMP is quite clear that Big Endian order shall be used
     and
               BOM shall NOT be used in transmission in the protocol.
               Transmitting Unicode in Big Endian order in SNMP should
               not prove to be a hardship for Little Endian machines,
               since SNMP ASN.1/BER requires integers to be transmitted
               in Big Endian order as well.  So SNMP implementations on
               Little Endian machines are already reversing the order of
               integers to make them Big Endian for transmission via
               SNMP.  Also Unicode characters are usually treated as
               two-octet integers, not short text strings, so that it
     will
               be straightforward for Little Endian machines to reverse
     the
               order of Unicode character octets as well before
               transmitting them and after receiving them via the SNMP
               protocol.

               Where a given coded character set may be known by more
     than
               one name, the most commonly known name is used as the
     name
               of the enumeration and other names are shown in the
               comments.  The comments also indicate where to find
     detailed
               information on the coded character set and briefly
               characterize its relationship to other similar coded
               character sets.

               The current list of character sets and their enumerated
               values used to reference them is contained in the IANA
               Character Set registry.  The enum value is indicated by
               the MIBenum entry in the registry.  The enum symbol is
               indicated by the Alias that starts with `cs' for
     character
               set.

               The IANA character sets registry is available via
               anonymous ftp.

               The ftp server is ftp.isi.edu.
               The subdirectory is /in-notes/iana/assignments/.

             to determine how a particular alert is handled and how and
     to
             whom that alert is routed.  The following are the four
             training levels of alerts:

                    Field Service - Alerts that typically require
     advanced
                           training and technical knowledge of the
     printer
                      and its sub-units. An example of a technical
                           person would be a manufacturer's Field
     Service
                           representative, or other person formally
                           trained by the manufacturer or similar
                           representative.
                    Trained - Alerts that require an intermediate or
     moderate
                           level of knowledge of the printer and its
                           sub-units. A typical examples of alerts that
                           a trained operator can handle is replacing
                           toner cartridges.
                    Untrained - Alerts that can be fixed without prior
                           training either because the action to correct
                           the alert is obvious or the printer can help
     the
                           untrained person fix the problem. A typical
                           example of such an alert is reloading paper
                           trays and emptying output bins on a low end
                           printer.
                    Management - Alerts that have to do with overall
                           operation of and configuration of the
     printer.
                           Examples of management events are

            alert code can be used for a binary change event or a unary
     change
            event, depending on implementation. Also, the same alert
     code can be
            used to indicate a critical or a non-critical (warning)
     alert,
            depending on implementation. The value of
     prtAlertSeverityLevel
            specifies binary vs. unary and critical vs. non-critical for
     each
            event for the implementation.

            While there are some specific codes for many subunits, the
     generic
            codes should be used for most subunit alerts. The network
     management
            station can then query the subunit specified by
     prtAlertGroup to
            determine further subunit status and other subunit
     information.

            An agent shall not add two entries to the alert table for
     the same
            event, one containing a generic event code and the other
     containing a
            specific event code; the agent shall add only one entry in
     the alert
            table for each event; either generic (preferred) or
     specific, not
            both.

            Implementation of the unary change event
            alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) is optional. When
     implemented,
            this alert code shall indicate to network management
     stations that
            the trailing edge of a binary change event has occurred and
     the
            corresponding alert entry has been removed from the alert
     table. As
            with all events, the alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801)
     alert
            shall be placed at the end of the alert table. Such an alert
     table
            entry shall specify the following information:

               prtAlertSeverityLevel    warningUnaryChangeEvent(4)
               prtAlertTrainingLevel    noInterventionRequired(7)

               prtAlertGroupIndex       the index of the row in the
     alert
                                   table of the binary change event
                                   that this event has removed.

     -- The Print Job Delivery Channel Group
     --
     -- Implementation of every object in this group is mandatory.

     -- Print Job Delivery Channels are independent sources of print
     data. Here,
     -- print data is the term used for the information that is
     -- used to construct printed pages and may have both data
     -- and control aspects. The output of a channel is in a form
     -- suitable for input to one of the interpreters as a
     -- stream. A channel may be independently enabled (allowing
     -- print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of
     -- print data). A printer may have one or more channels.
     --
     -- The Print Job Delivery Channel table describes the capabilities
     of the
     -- printer and not what is currently being performed by the
     printer.
     --
     -- Basically, the print job delivery channel abstraction describes
     -- the final processing step of getting the print data to an
     -- interpreter. It might include some level of
     -- decompression or decoding of print stream data.
     -- channel. All of these aspects are hidden in the channel
     -- abstraction.
     --
     -- There are many kinds of print job delivery channels; some of
     which are based
     -- on networks and others which are not. For example, a
     -- channel can be a serial (or parallel) connection; it can
     -- be a service, such as the Unix Line Printer Daemon (LPD),
     -- offering services over a network connection (interface); or
     -- it could be a disk drive into which a floppy disk with
     -- the print data is inserted. Each print job delivery channel is
     typically
     -- identified by the electronic path and/or service protocol
     -- used to deliver print data to a print data interpreter.
     --
     -- Channel example                   Implementation

     -- Adobe AppSocket(9101) channel  a bi-directional extension of LPD
     --
     -- It is easy to note that this is a mixed bag.  There are
     -- some physical connections over which no (or very meager)
     -- protocols are run (e.g. the serial or old parallel ports)
     -- and there are services which often have elaborate
     -- protocols that run over a number of protocol stacks. In
     -- the end, what is important is the delivery of print data
     -- thru the channel.
     --
     -- The print job delivery channel sub-units are represented by the
     -- Print Job Delivery Channel Group in the Model. It has a current
     -- print job control language, which can be used to specify which
     -- interpreter is to be used for the print data and to query and
     change
     -- environment variables used by the interpreters (and
     -- Management Applications). There is also a default
     -- interpreter that is to be used if an interpreter is not
     -- explicitly specified using the Control Language.

     --       The print job delivery channel table and its underlying
     structure
     --
     -- The first seven items in the Print Job Delivery Channel Table
     define the
     -- "channel" itself.  A channel typically depends on other
     -- protocols and interfaces to provide the data that flows
     -- thru the channel.
     --
     -- Control of a print job delivery channel is largely limited to
     enabling
     -- or disabling the entire channel itself. It is likely, however,
     -- that more control of the process of accessing print data
     -- will be needed over time. Thus, the ChannelType will
     -- allow type-specific data to be associated with each
     -- channel (using ChannelType specific groups in a fashion
     -- analogous to the media specific MIBs that are associated
     -- with the IANAIfType in the Interfaces Table). As a first
     -- step in this direction, each channel will identify the
     -- underlying Interface on which it is based. This is the
     -- eighth object in each row of the table.

             information that is available once the channel is in use.

             The encoding and interpretation of the
     prtChannelInformation
             object is specific to channel type.  The description of
     each
             PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation
     is
             defined specifies the appropriate encoding and

             including interaction with other objects.  For channel
     types
             that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its
     value
             shall be null (0 length).

             When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered,
     its
             accompanying description must specify the encoding and
             interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the
             channel type.  prtChannelInformation semantics for an
     existing
             PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner
     as
             described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.

             The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection
     of
             channel attributes, represented as text according to the
             following rules:

              1. The prtChannelInformation is coded in the NVT ASCII
                 character set.  It is not affected by localization.

              2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries
     representing
                 the attribute values.  Each entry consists of the
     following
                 items, in order:
                  a. a keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z,
                     a-z), that identifies a channel attribute,
                  b. an Equals Sign (=) to delimit the keyword,
                  c. a data value, consisting of NVT ASCII graphics
                     characters (codes 32-126),
                  d. a Line Feed character (code 10) to delimit the data
                     value.
                 No other characters shall be present.

                 Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally, keywords
     are
                 capitalized (including each word of a multi-word
     keyword),

                 and, since they occupy space in the
     prtChannelInformation,
                 they are kept short.

              3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is
                 represented by multiple entries with the same keyword,
     each
                 specifying one value.  Otherwise, there shall be at
     most
                 one entry for each attribute.

              4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If there
     are
                 ordering constraints for particular entries, these must
     be
                 specified in their definitions.

              5. The prtChannelInformation value may represent
     information
                 that is not normally coded in textual form, or that is
     coded
                 in a character set other than NVT ASCII.  In these
     cases,
                 whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used
     for
                 the information should be used for encoding the
                 prtChannelInformation.  (For instance, a binary port
     value
                 might be represented as a decimal number, Unicode would
                 be represented in UTF-8 format.)

              6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation
                 entries are defined, the descriptive text associated
     with the
                 PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the
     following
                 information for each entry:
                 Title:          Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port
     name'
                                 'Service Name'
                 Keyword:        The keyword value, eg: 'Port' or
     'Service'
                 Syntax:         The encoding of the entry value, if it
                                 cannot be directly represented by NVT
     ASCII,
                 Status:         'Mandatory', 'Optional', or
     'Conditionally
                                 Mandatory'
                 Multiplicity:   'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate
     whether
                                 the entry may be present multiple
     times,

             This is an incrementing integer starting from zero
             every time the printer is reset.  When the printer
             adds an alert to the table, that alert is assigned
             the next higher integer value from the last item
             entered into the table.  If the index value reaches
             its maximum value, the next item entered will cause
             the index value to roll over and start at zero
             again.  The first event placed in the alert table
             after a reset of the printer shall
             have an index value of 1.  NOTE: The management
             application will read the alert table when a trap
             or event notification occurs or at a periodic rate
             and then parse the table to determine if any new
             entries were added by comparing the last known index
             value with the current highest index value. The
             management application will then update its copy of
             the alert table.  When the printer discovers that
             an alert is no longer active, the printer shall
             remove the row for that alert from the table and
             shall reduce the number of rows in the table.  The
             printer may add or delete any number of rows from
             the table at any time.  The management station
             can detect when binary change alerts have been deleted by
             requesting an attribute of each alert, and noting
             alerts as deleted when that retrieval is not possible."

     Appendix A - Glossary of Terms

     Addressability - on the marker, the number of distinctly setable
     marking units (pels) per unit of addressability unit; for example,
     300 dots per inch is expressed as 300 per 1000 Thousandths Of
     Inches and 4 dots per millimeter is 4 per 1000 Micrometers.
     Addressability is not resolution because marks that are one
     addressability position apart may not be independently resolvable
     by the eye due to factors such as gain in the area of marks so they
     overlap or nearly touch.

     Alert - a reportable event for which there is an entry in the alert
     table

     Bin - an output sub-unit which may or may not be removable

     Binary Change Event - an event which comes in pairs; the leading
     edge event and the trailing edge event. The leading edge event
     enters a state from which there is only one exit. A binary change
     event may be critical or non-critical. See unary change event.

     Bursting - the process by which continuous media is separated into
     individual sheets, typically by bursting along pre-formed
     perforations.

     Channel - A term used to describe a single source of data which is
     presented to a printer.  The model that we use in describing a

     printer allows for an arbitrary number of channels.  Multiple
     channels can exist on the same physical port.  This is commonly
     done over EtherNet ports where EtherTalk, TCP/IP, and SPX/IPX
     protocols can be supplying different data streams simultaneously to
     a single printer on the same physical port.

     Collation - in multiple copy output, placing the pages from
     separate copies into separate ordered sets, ready for binding.

     Control Language - a data syntax or language for controlling the
     printer through the print data channel.

     Critical Alert - an alert triggered by an event which leads to a
     state in which printing is no longer possible; the printer is
     stopped

     Decollating - the process by which the individual parts within a
     multi-part form are separated and sorted into separate stacks for
     each part.

     Description - information about the configuration and capabilities
     of the printer and its various sub-units

     DPA - ISO 10175 Document Printing Application standard.  A standard
     for a client server protocol for a print system, including (1)
     submitting print jobs to and (2) managing print jobs in a spooler

     Event - a state change in the printer

     Group - a collection of objects that represent a type of sub-unit
     of the printer

     IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  See STD 2, RFC 1700.

     Idempotent - Idempotence is the property of an operation that
     results in the same state no matter how many times it is executed
     (at least once).  This is a property that is shared by true
     databases in which operations on data items only change the state
     of the data item and do not have other side effects.  Because the
     SNMP data model is that of operations on a database, SNMP MIB
     objects should be assumed to be idempotent.  If a MIB object is
     defined in a non-idempotent way, the this data model can break in
     subtle ways when faced with packet loss, multiple managers, and
     other common conditions.

     In order to fulfill the common need for actions to result from SNMP
     Set operations, SNMP MIB objects can be modeled such that the
     change in state from one state to another has the side effect of
     causing an action.  It is important to note that with this model,
     an SNMP operation that sets a value equal to its current value will
     cause no action.  This retains the idempotence of a single command,
     while allowing actions to be initiated by SNMP SET requests.

     Input - a tray or bin from which instances of the media are
     obtained and fed into the Media Path

     Interpreter - the embodiment of an algorithm that processes a data
     stream consisting of a Page Description Language (PDL) and/or a
     Control Language.

     Localization - the specification of human language, country, and
     character set needed to present information to people in their
     native languages.

     Management Application (a.k.a. Manager) - a program which queries
     and controls one or more managed nodes

     Management Station - a physical computer on which one or more
     management applications can run

     Media Path - the mechanisms that transport instances of the media
     from an input, through the marker, possibly through media buffers
     and duplexing pathways, out to the output with optional finishing
     applied.  The inputs and outputs are not part of the Media Path.

     Non-critical Alert - an alert triggered by a reportable event which
     does not lead to a state in which printing is no longer possible;
     such an alert may lead to a state from which printing may no longer
     be possible in the future, such as the low toner state or the alert
     may be pure informational, such as a configuration change at the
     printer.

     Output - a bin or stacker which accepts instances of media that
     have been processed by a printer

     Page Description Language (PDL) - a data syntax or language for the
     electronic representation of a document as a sequence of page
     images.

     Printer - a physical device that takes media from an input source,
     produces marks on that media according to some page description or
     page control language and puts the result in some output
     destination, possibly with finishing applied.

     Printing - the entire process of producing a printed document from
     generation of the file to be printed, choosing printing properties,
     selection of a printer, routing, queuing, resource management,
     scheduling, and finally printing including notifying the user

     Reportable event - an event that is deemed of interest to a
     management station watching the printer

     Status - information regarding the current operating state of the
     printer and its various sub-units. This is an abstraction of the
     exact physical condition of the printer.

     Sub-mechanism - a distinguishable part of a sub-unit

     Sub-unit - a part of the printer which may be a physical part, such
     as one of the input sources or a logical part such as an
     interpreter.

     Tray - an input sub-unit which is typically removable

     Unary Change Event - an event that indicates a change of state of
     the printer, but to a state which is (often) just as valid as the
     state that was left, and from which no return is necessary. See
     binary change event.

     Visible state - that portion of the state of the printer that can
     be examined by a management application

     Warning - a non-critical alert. See non-critical alert.



     Appendix B - Media Size Names from ISO/IEC 10175 Document Printing
     Architecture

     For the convenience of management application developers, this
     appendix lists the standardized media size names from ISO/IEC 10175
     Document Printing Application (DPA). Management applications that
     present a dialogue for choosing or displaying media size are
     encouraged to present relevant names from this list to avoid
     requiring the user to remember the physical dimensions used to
     describe the size of the media. A printer implementing the Printer
     MIB has no knowledge of these names, however; all media sizes in
     the MIB are given in terms of media dimensions as the values of
     prtMediaDimFeedDir and prtInputChosenMediaDimXFeedDir.

     Appendix C - Media Names

     For the convenience of management application developers, this
     appendix lists the standardized media names from ISO/IEC 10175
     Document Printing Application (DPA). Management applications that
     present a dialogue for choosing media may wish to use these names
     as an alternative to separately specifying, size, color, and/or
     type. Using standard media names will mean that a single management
     application dealing with printers from different vendors and under
     different system mangers will tend to use the same names for the
     same media. If selection of media by name is used, the attributes
     (size, type or color) implied by the name must be explicitly mapped
     to the appropriate object (prtInputDeclared-MediaDimFeedDir,
     prtInputDeclaredMediaDimXFeedDir, prtInputMediaType and
     prtInputMediaColor) in the MIB. The object prtInputMediaName is
     intended for display to an operator and is purely descriptive. The
     value in prtInputMediaName is not interpreted by the printer so
     using a standard name for this value will not change any of the
     other media attributes nor will it cause an alert if the media in
     the input sub-unit does not match the name.

     Appendix D - Roles of Users

     Background

     The need for "Role Models" stemmed in large part from the need to
     understand the importance of any given proposed object for the MIB.
     Many times the real world need for a proposed object would be
     debated within the group; the debate would typically result in the
     need to describe the potential usage of the object in terms of a
     "live" person performing some type of printing-related task.

     Determining the value of a proposed object through identification
     of the associated human users was found to be so common that a more
     formalized model was required for consistent analysis.  The model
     describing categories of human-oriented tasks is called "Role
     Models" in this document.

     In developing the Role Models it was necessary to identify the
     common, primary tasks that humans typically face when interacting
     with a printer and its related printing system(s).  It was expected
     that certain kinds of tasks would serve to identify the various
     Role Models.

     In presenting the set of Role Models, the set of "Common Print
     System Tasks" are first presented, followed by the set of Role
     Model definitions.  Finally, a simple matrix is presented in which
     Role Models and Tasks are cross-compared.

     Upon researching the many tasks encountered by humans in dealing
     with printers and printing systems, the following were found to be
     pervasive within any operating environment:


       Printer job state - Determine the status of a job without a
     printer.
       Printer capabilities - Determine the current capabilities of a
          printer, for example, the available media sizes, two-sided
          printing, a particular type of interpreter, etc.
       Printer job submission - Submit a print job to a printer.
       Printer job removal - Remove a job from a printer.
       Notification of events - Receive notification of the existence of
     a
          defined printer event.  An event can be of many types,
     including
          warnings, errors, job stage completion (e.g., "job done"),
     etc.
       Printer configuration - Query the current configuration of a
          printer.
       Printer consumables - Determine the current state of any and all
          consumables within a printer.
       Print job identification - Determine the identification of a job
          within a printer.
       Internal printer status - Determine the current status of the
          printer.
       Printer identification - Determine the identity of a printer.
       Printer location - Determine the physical location of a printer.
       Local system configuration - Determine various aspects of the
          current configuration of the local system involved with the
          operation of a printer.

     These "tasks" cover a large spectrum of requirements surrounding
     the operation of a printer in a network environment.  This list
     serves as the basis for defining the various Role Models described
     below.

     Proposed Role Models

     Following is the list of "Role Models" used to evaluate the
     requirements for any given Printer MIB object.  Note that the
     keyword enclosed in parentheses represents an abbreviation for the
     particular Role Model in the matrix described later in this
     document.

     User  (USER) - A person or application that submits print jobs to
     the printer; typically viewed as the "end user" within the overall
     printing environment.

     Operator  (OP) - A person responsible for maintaining a printer on
     a day-to-day basis, including such tasks as filling empty media
     trays, emptying full output trays, replacing toner cartridges,
     clearing simple paper jams, etc.

     Technician  (TECH) - A person responsible for repairing a
     malfunctioning printer, performing routine preventive maintenance,
     and other tasks that typically require advanced training on the
     printer internals.  An example of a "technician" would be a
     manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other person
     formally trained by the manufacturer or similar representative.

     System Manager  (MGR) - A person responsible for configuration and
     troubleshooting of components involved in the overall printing
     environment, including printers, print queues and network
     connectivity issues.  This person is typically responsible for
     ensuring the overall operational integrity of the print system
     components, and is typically viewed as the central point of
     coordination among all other Role Models.

     Help Desk  (HELP) - A person responsible for supporting Users in
     their printing needs, including training Users and troubleshooting
     Users' printing problems.

     Asset Manager  (AM) - A person responsible for managing an
     organization's printing system assets (primarily printers).  Such a
     person needs to be able to identify and track the location of
     printing assets on an ongoing basis.

     Capacity Planner  (CP) - A person responsible for tracking the
     usage of printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of
     planning printer acquisitions and/or placement of printers based on
     usage trends.

     Installer  (INST) - A person or application responsible for
     installing or configuring printing system components on a local
     system.

     Accountant  (ACCT) - A person responsible for tracking the usage of
     printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of charging
     Users for resources used.

     Matrix of Common Print System Tasks and Role Models

     To better understand the relationship between the set of defined
     "Common Print System Tasks" and the various "Role Models," the
     following matrix is provided.

     It is important to recognize that many of the tasks will appear to
     be applicable to many of the Role Models.  However, when
     considering the actual context of a task, it is very important to
     realize that often the actual context of a task is such that the
     Role Model can change.

     For example, it is obvious that a "System Manager" must be able to
     submit print jobs to a printer; however, when submitting a print
     job, a person identified as a "System Manager" is actually
     operating in the context of a "User" in this case; hence, the

     requirement to submit a print job is not listed as a requirement
     for a System Manager.

     Conversely, while a "User" must be able to remove a job previously
     submitted to a printer, an "Operator" is often expected to be able
     to remove any print job from any printer; hence, print job removal
     is a (subtly different) requirement for both the "User" and
     "Operator" Role Models.
