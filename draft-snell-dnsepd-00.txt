Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



1.  Introduction


   This document introduces mechanisms for DNS-based discovery of Web
   service endpoints.  Introduced are two new DNS resource record types
   and the conventions for their use.  A fundamental understanding of
   the DNS protocol and the core DNS resource record types as described
   in RFCs 1034 [2], 1035 [3] and 2782 [7] is assumed.


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].


1.1  Bootstrapping Web service infrastructure


   The Web services architecture defines an abstract model for the
   publication and discovery  of Web services.  Upon deploying a Web
   service instance, the service provider advertises the services
   existence in a registry capable of allowing potential consumers to
   locate the information necessary to bind to and consume the service.


   The minimal amount of information necessary to allow a client to
   consume the service is the network location at which the service has
   been deployed and the identity of the so-called "PortType"
   implemented by the service.  The "PortType" is a description of all
   the input and output messages supported by the Web service as
   described in a WSDL document.  This PortType is identified by an XML
   namespace plus simple name pair known as a Qualified Name or QName.
   Knowing the PortType implemented by a Web services allows one to know
   exactly which types of messages to send to a service endpoint and
   which types of messages to expect that service to return.  PortTypes
   and their QNames are defined within Web Service Description Language
   (WSDL) documents [8].


   In a Service Oriented Architecture, there are several classifications
   of services available for an application to consume.  Some are
   business-level services whose Port Types are specific to given
   applications.  Others are infrastructure-level services whose Port
   Types are well known and consistent across multiple types of
   applications.  An example of a business-level service would include a
   service a company may deploy to accept purchase orders from
   customers.  An example of a well-known common infrastructure-level
   service is the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration
   (UDDI) service as defined by [9].


   An application's choice to use specific business-level services may
   be based on a variety of complex criteria including service level
   agreements, geographic location, contractual obligations, etc and
   therefore potentially requires complex discovery mechanisms beyond




Snell & Donoho           Expires April 15, 2005                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



   simple resolution of endpoint location and Port Type QName.
   Infrastructure level services, however - particularly those
   deployed within a protected or private domain such as an intranet -
   are generally selected based simply on their availability within a
   given domain.  For example, if one wishes to use UDDI services to
   locate business services within an intranet, one would simply look
   for any and all UDDI services available within that intranet domain.
   In such cases, it is sufficient to resolve nothing more than the
   location and PortType QName of the service in question.


   DNS-EPD introduces a process for resolving the location of common
   services that is similar in nature to using the telephone white pages
   directory.  As opposed to the telephone yellow pages, which organize
   numbers into a complex taxonomy organized by service category, the
   white pages provide nothing more than a simple name-to-number
   mapping.  That is, if I wanted to find a phone number for any French
   restaurant in New York City, I would use the yellow pages to browse
   all available French restaurants and select one that suits my needs.
   If, however, I wanted to find the phone number for a specific French
   restaurant in New York City, I would use the white pages to look up
   the name of that specific restaurant and find its phone number.  With
   DNS-EPD, if a client wishes to locate a specific instance of a Web
   service, it would go to DNS and resolve the current location of that
   service by name.


   A second key issue is that once a Web service's location has been
   resolved, how can one automatically detect changes that may occur in
   the configuration and deployment of those services?  While
   administrators can hard code references to Web services into every
   deployed Web services component, doing so makes the infrastructure
   inherently brittle and difficult to manage.  In a world of
   dynamically, and intelligently managed infrastructure, administrators
   need systems capable of automatically responding to changes in their
   networked environment.  DNS-EPD's approach is to assign names to
   services and to allow components a means of using those names to
   dynamically resolve - at run-time - the metadata necessary to
   access those resources, allowing applications to intelligently
   respond to changes and promoting loose coupling between applications
   and the supporting infrastructure.


1.2  Mapping Web service artifacts into the domain name space


   Outside of DNS, the primary means of referencing Web service
   endpoints is the Web Service Addressing [10] Endpoint Reference
   (EPR).  An EPR is a relatively simple XML structure that, at a
   minimum, specifies the network location of the service endpoint and
   the QName of the PortType implemented by the service.  Additional
   pieces of information may be included, such as a digital signature




Snell & Donoho           Expires April 15, 2005                 [Page 4]
Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



   verifying the authenticity of the endpoint reference and a policy
   detailing various constraints and requirements that must be met in
   order to consume the service.  An example WS-Addressing Endpoint
   Reference is below.


     <EndpointReference
       xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing"
       xmlns:abc="urn:MyStockQuotes">
         <Address>http://example.com/services/mystocks</Address>
         <PortType>abc:MyStockQuotes</PortType>
     </EndpointReference>


   A key design goal of DNS-EPD is to not introduce yet another set of
   artifacts usable to reference and identify Web service endpoints;
   rather, the DNS-EPD conventions define a means of mapping
   WS-Addressing Endpoint References into the Domain Name Space.


   The Endpoint Reference Resource Record described in section four is
   the semantic equivalent to the basic WS-Addressing Endpoint Reference
   illustrated above.


     mystocks._ws.example.com EPR 100 0 0 example.com
                                  /services/mystocks
                                  {urn:MyStockQuotes}MyStockQuotes


   For the DNS-EPD mechanisms to be successful, however, there must be a
   means of incorporating the more extensive descriptions supported by
   WS-Addressing Endpoint References with the information contained in
   DNS.  DNS-EPD does so in two ways: 1) by allowing an EPR resource
   record to externally reference the additional information using an
   HTTP GET URL reference to that information and 2) using a new XML
   resource record capable of storing well-formed XML fragments directly
   within the DNS database.


   This referenced or contained information may include artifacts such
   as the complete WS-Addressing Endpoint Reference for a service, or a
   Web Service Policy document associated with the service, or even a
   WSDL document that describes the PortType implemented by the service.


   The combination of the EPR and XML resource records allows one to
   fully and naturally map existing Web service artifacts into the
   domain name space.


2.  DNS-EPD Resource records


   This section introduces the Endpoint Reference (EPR) and XML
   Information (XML) resource record types and a means of browsing the
   domain name space for EPR resource records.

Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



2.1  Establishment of DNS names for Web services


   DNS names associated with DNS-EPD resource records MUST follow the
   {name}._ws.{domain} pattern, where {name} is an arbitrary set of one
   or more DNS labels relevant to the type of service being advertised,
   _ws is a special DNS label indicating that the DNS name refers to a
   Web service, and {domain} is the DNS domain within which the Web
   service has been deployed.


   Examples of such names follow:


     inquire.uddi._ws.example.com
     mystocks._ws.example.com
     wsnbroker._ws.example.com


   The {name} portion in these examples ("inquire.uddi", "mystocks", and
   "wsnbroker" respectively) are assigned by DNS administrators or
   industry specific standards bodies and SHOULD be selected in a manner
   that would allow a human reading the name to be able to identify the
   type of Web service being described.  It is expected that best
   practice naming conventions will evolve through the consistent
   application of the DNS-EPD specifications much in the same way that
   the "www" naming convention has been adopted for the naming of Web
   servers.  It is also foreseeable that names for various common Web
   service types will be codified within specifications that define the
   service type.  The bottom line is that the method such conventions
   are defined is considered out of scope for this document.


   It must be pointed out, however, that to be effective and to avoid
   confusion, names identifying service types should be unique, even
   across domains.  For example, the name prefix inquire.uddi._ws.
   should identify UDDI Inquire services regardless of the domain in
   which the services are being advertised.  The only way to achieve
   global uniqueness of such names is to codify the name and meaning in
   a standards specification.


2.2  Endpoint Reference (EPR) Resource record


   Web Service Endpoint References are represented in DNS using the EPR
   resource record.  The format of the EPR RR is given below.  The DNS
   type code for the EPR RR is TBD.


2.2.1  EPR RDATA format


   The RDATA of the EPR record consists of six required and one optional
   field.

     | LENGTH |             WSDL_URI (Variable Length)  /
     +-----+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+



2.2.1.1  Flags


   An 8-bit unsigned byte field specifying option flags for the EPR
   record.  The bit field consists of four defined bits and four
   reserved bits.


   The first two bits, starting from the least-significant bit, are
   "information bits" indicating whether or not additional information
   has been provided either in DNS or via an external HTTP URL reference
   to a WSDL [8] document describing the service.


   Bit 1 (0x01), if set, indicates that additional information in the
   form of XML resource records have been provided.  This bit will be
   referred to as the XML INFO BIT.  By default this bit is unset.


   Bit 2 (0x02), if set, indicates that additional information has been
   provided in the form of a WSDL document referenced via HTTP URL
   reference in the WSDL_URI field.  This bit will be referred to as the
   WSDL INFO BIT.  By default this bit is unset.


   Bits 3 and 4 are mutually exclusive "target bits" that indicate
   whether or not the EPR resource record's TARGET field references an
   A/AAAA record or an SRV record.


   Bit 3 (0x04), if set, indicates that the TARGET field references an
   A/AAAA resource record.  This bit will be referred to as the A TARGET
   BIT.  This is the default.


   Bit 4 (0x08), if set, indicates that the TARGET field reference a SRV
   resource record.  This bit will be referred to as the SRV TARGET BIT.


   The A and SRV target bits are mutually exclusive.  At most one of the
   bits MUST be set.  If both are set, the most significant bit (the SRV
   TARGET BIT) set takes precedence.  One of the bits MUST be set.

Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



   The remaining 4 bits are reserved for future use and MUST remain
   unset.


   For example, the flags field for an EPR specifying no additional
   information and a reference to an A/AAAA record would equal 00000100.
   An EPR specifying additional information via an HTTP URL reference
   and a reference to an SRV record would be 00001010.


                  SRV TARGET BIT
                  |
                  |A TARGET BIT
                  ||
              00001010
              |__|  ||
               |    ||
               |    ||
               |    |XML INFORMATION BIT
   Reserved bits    |
                    WSDL INFORMATION BIT



2.2.1.2  Priority


   An 8-bit unsigned byte field (range 0-255) specifying a numeric
   priority for this endpoint reference record relative to other
   endpoint reference records associated with the same name.  A client
   MUST attempt to use the endpoint reference with the lowest-numbered
   priority it can reach.  Endpoint references with the same priority
   SHOULD be tried in an order determined by the value of the WEIGHT
   field described below.


2.2.1.3  Weight


   An 8-bit unsigned byte field (range 0-255) specifying a relative
   weight for endpoint references with the same PRIORITY.  Endpoint
   references specifying larger weight values SHOULD be given a
   proportionally higher probability of being selected for use.  A
   Weight of 0 should be assigned when no endpoint reference selection
   should be performed (e.g.  when there is only a single Endpoint
   Reference or when multiple endpoint references should be selected at
   random with an equal probability of selection).


   Ordering of Endpoint Reference records of the same PRIORITY should be
   performed according to the following algorithm, starting with the
   EPR's with the lowest PRIORITY value.
   o  Order all EPRs in ascending order according to WEIGHT
   o  Compute the sum of the WEIGHTs for each EPR, associating the
      running sum of the weights with each EPR in order.

Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



   o  Choose a uniform random number between 0 and the computed sum of
      weights.
   o  Select the first EPR whose associated running sum value is equal
      to or greater than the random number selected.
   o  Remove the selected EPR from the collection and add it to a second
      list of ordered EPRs.
   o  Repeat the process until each of the EPRs in the original list has
      been selected and added to the list of ordered EPRs.
   o  Repeat the process for each PRIORITY level.


   Once all EPRs have been ordered in this fashion, a client will select
   each EPR in the list, using the first that it is capable of using to
   bind to and invoke the service.


2.2.1.4  Target


   A DNS domain name that will be associated with either A/AAAA resource
   record(s) if the FLAGS field A TARGET BIT is set or SRV resource
   record(s) if the FLAGS field SRV TARGET BIT is set.  The TARGET field
   is used to specify the network location where the Web service has
   been deployed and the network application protocol used to invoke the
   service.  If referencing A/AAAA records, the network application
   protocol is assumed to be HTTP using the default TCP port 80.  If
   referencing SRV records, the network application protocol will be
   specified by the referenced SRV record.  Further, if the TARGET field
   references multiple SRV records, those SRV records are to be ordered
   and selected as specified in [7].  If the TARGET field references
   multiple A records, those A records are to be ordered and selected in
   any manner the requester deems appropriate.


2.2.1.5  Path


   A UTF-8 encoded <character-string> specifying the additional URI path
   information for the Web service endpoint including appropriate query
   string parameters and fragment identifiers.  For instance, if a Web
   service is deployed at the HTTP URL
   http://www.example.com/services/inquire, PATH will equal /services/
   inquire.  As the value of PATH is intended to be used in a URI,
   characters in the path MUST be properly escaped as defined in [6].
   In the RDATA encoding, PATH MUST be preceded by a 2-byte unsigned
   integer in network byte order (big-endian) specifying the total
   length in octets of the field data.  The value of the PATH field MAY
   be an empty string in which case the specified length in octets MUST
   be 0.


2.2.1.6  PortType QName (QNAME)


   A UTF-8 encoded <character-string> specifying the Namespace URI of

Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



   the WSDL defined PortType QName implemented by the Web service
   described by the EPR record.  The <character-string> MUST use the
   format {namespace-uri}localpart as in the example
   {urn:mystocks}MyStocksPortType, where urn:mystocks is the Namespace
   URI portion of the QName and MyStocksPortType is the Localpart
   portion of the QName.  In the RDATA encoding, QNAME MUST be preceded
   by a 2-byte unsigned integer in network byte order specifying the
   total length in octets of the field data.  The value of the QNAME
   field MUST NOT be an empty string.  For QNames that specify a null
   namespace, the encoding would be {}LocalPart.


2.2.1.7  WSDL URI Reference (WSDL_URI)


   A UTF-8 encoded <character-string> specifying a URI where a WSDL
   document describing the service may be accessed.  The WSDL_URI field
   MUST NOT be included in the EPR resource record unless the WSDL INFO
   BIT is set.  In the RDATA encoding, WSDL_URI MUST be preceded by a
   2-byte unsigned integer in network byte order specifying the total
   length in octets of the field data.  If the WSDL INFO BIT is set, the
   WSDLURI field value MUST NOT be an empty string.


2.2.2  EPR Presentation format


   The presentation format for EPR records is as illustrated below.



     FLAGS PRIORITY WEIGHT TARGET PATH QNAME WSDL_URI


     MyStockQuotes._stockquotes._ws.example.com
        EPR   101 0 0 services.example.com
              /services/stockquotes
              {urn:mystocks}MyStockQuotes
              http://services.example.com/stocks.wsdl


   In this format, the FLAGS field is represented as a three digit
   numeric value with the first digit (starting from the left)
   representing the target bits and the second and third digits
   representing the XML and WSDL information bits, respectively.  A
   target bit (first digit) value of 1 indicates that the A TARGET BIT
   is set.  A target bit value of 2 indicates that the SRV TARGET BIT is
   set.  An XML information bit value of 1 indicates that the XML

   value of 1 indicates that the WSDL INFORMATION BIT is set.  A WSDL
   information bit value of 0 indicates that the WSDL INFORMATION BIT is

   reference would specify 201 for the flags field in the master file
   format.  All of the available permutations are illustrated below.


     100 - A/AAAA Target, no additional information
     110 - A/AAAA Target, additional information in XML records, no WSDL
           reference
     101 - A/AAAA Target, additional information in WSDL document, no 
           XML records
     111 - A/AAAA Target, additional information in WSDL document and 
           XML records
     200 - SRV Target, no additional information
     210 - SRV Target, additional information in XML records, no WSDL 
           reference
     201 - SRV Target, additional information in WSDL document, no XML 
           records
     211 - SRV Target, additional information in WSDL document and XML 
           records


   The PRIORITY and WEIGHT fields are each represented as unsigned
   integer values in the range 0-255.


   The PATH and QNAME fields MUST be present.  If the value of the PATH
   field is an empty string, a single backwards-slash \ character (ASCII
   character 92, hex 0x5C) MUST be specified in the PATH field.  The
   value of the QNAME field MUST NOT be an empty string.


   The WSDL_URI field MUST only be present if the third digit in the
   FLAGS field is set to 1 (indicating that the WSDL INFORMATION BIT is
   to be set).  If the WSDL INFORMATION BIT is set, the WSDL_URI field
   MUST be a fully qualified absolute URL.


2.3  XML Information (XML) Resource record


   One of the key goals of this specification is to provide the means of
   querying DNS to locate and resolve complete information about a Web
   service endpoint.  The collection of Web services related
   specifications/standards define a number of XML formats useful for
   describing various characteristics of Web service endpoints.  This
   specification provides for two means of querying this information by
   allowing an EPR resource record to specify that such information may
   either be accessed via an HTTP GET request or by submitting an
   additional query to DNS for all XML records associated with the same
   domain name as the EPR.


   The format of the XML RR is given below.  The DNS type code for the
   XML RR is TBD.


2.3.1  XML RDATA format


   The RDATA of the XML record consists of a single encoding byte flag
   followed by a well-formed XML fragment encoded in the manner
   identified by the value of the encoding byte flag.



Snell & Donoho           Expires April 15, 2005                [Page 11]
Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



                                        1  1  1  1  1  1
       0     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
     +-----+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     | ENC |                   RDATA                    /
     +-----+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   The encoding byte flag specifies an unsigned integer value (range
   0-255) that indicates how the XML contained in the RDATA has been
   encoded.  The default value of 0x00 indicates that the remaining
   RDATA is a UTF-8 encoded character-string containing XML 1.0.
   Additional values for the encoding byte flag MUST be allocated by
   IANA following IETF consensus.  DNS implementations MUST send the XML
   data using the encoding specified by the encoding byte flag.  If the
   encoding specified is not understood by the DNS implementation, the
   XML RR MUST be ignored.


   The XML contained in the XML Information record MUST NOT contain a
   prolog, a document type declaration, processing instructions, or
   unnecessary whitespace such as that typically used for formatting and
   indenting XML documents.  See the next section for a discussion of
   the use of formatting whitespace in the presentation format.


   The XML contained in the XML Information record SHOULD NOT use
   relative URI's.  If relative URI's are used within the document, The
   xml:base attribute MUST be used to specify a base for those URIs.


     mystocks._ws.example.com XML 0 <EndpointReference xmlns="..."
                                      xml:base="http://example.com">
                                      <Address>/services/stocks</Address>
                                    </EndpointReference>



2.3.2  XML Presentation format


   The presentation format for the XML Information record RDATA consist
   of a single unsigned integer (range 0-255) specifying the encoding
   byte flag and a character-string representation of the XML fragment,
   with or without formatting whitespace (including cariage returns).
   If formatting whitespace is included in the presentation format, DNS
   implementations are required to strip that whitespace from the XML
   prior to encoding the RDATA for transmission.  The DNS implementation
   is required to encode the XML contained using the encoding specified
   in the encoding byte flag.


   As an alternative to including the XML data inline in DNS zone
   database files, an alternative syntax MAY be used to specify a URI
   reference to an external file where the XML RDATA may be recovered.
   The XML in the referenced location MUST be encoded in the manner

   specified by the encoding byte flag and MUST NOT include the prolog,
   document type declarations, processing instructions or unnecessary
   formatting whitespace.  The URI reference MUST be encapsulated in
   square brackets [ ].  Relative URI's, if used, are to be resolved
   relative to the location of the zone database file.


     mystocks._ws.example.com XML 0 [service.wsdl]



2.3.3  XML RR semantics


   The goal of the XML record is to provide a simple efficient means of
   storing XML within the DNS.  From the point of view of this
   specification, XML records are used solely for the purpose of
   allowing DNS administrators to publish arbitrary "additional
   information" about a Web service endpoint being advertised in DNS.
   It is up to the client to interpret the meaning of the XML contained
   within the record and determine whether or not the additional
   information is useful and relevant.  Upon querying for EPR resource
   records, a client would determine whether or not additional
   information is provided by checking the information bit in the flags
   portion of the EPR RDATA.  The XML INFORMATION bit is set, then the
   client MAY choose to submit a query for any XML records associated
   with the same DNS name as the EPR resource record.  If such a query
   is submitted, the DNS server would respond with all associated XML
   records.  The client would receive these records, parse their RDATA
   using any appropriate XML parser, and then determine the utility of
   the information returned.  Returned XML records that specify an
   encoding byte flag value that the client does not understand MUST be
   ignored.


     > nslookup -q=EPR mystocks._ws.example.com
       mystocks._ws.example.com  EPR 110 0 0 services.example.com
                                     stockquotes._ws.example.com
                                     /services/stockquotes
                                     {urn:mystocks}MyStockQuotes
     The XML Information bit is set, additional information in the form 
     of XML records is available.
     > nslookup -q=XML mystocks._ws.example.com
                                 XML 0 <EndpointReference xmlns="...">
                                          <Address>...</Address>
                                          <ReferenceProperties>
                                            ...
                                          </ReferenceProperties>
                                       </EndpointReference>


   When using DNS-EPD to resolve information about Web services, a DNS
   client MUST NOT submit any queries for XML resource records unless
   the EPR resource record's XML INFORMATION BIT is set.  The XML

Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



   Resource Record MAY be used for other purposes outside the scope of
   DNS-EPD but documenting such uses are considered out of scope of this
   specification.


   It should be noted that much existing deployed DNS infrastructure
   places strict practical limits on the size of DNS request and reply
   messages.  To work best within these constraints, limits should be
   placed on the size and complexity of the XML stored within DNS using
   XML records.  In short, the size of the XML fragments contained in
   DNS should be small enough to fit within a single UDP datagram that
   is short enough not to require IP fragmentation.  If the XML is not
   small enough to fit within this size constraint, then it SHOULD not
   be stored within DNS and the alternate HTTP GET based approach for
   referencing additional information should be used.


2.4  Enumerating EPR records


   DNS Administrators may allow clients to enumerate all services
   advertised within a given DNS domain by associating PTR resource
   records with the special _services._ws.{domain} name, where {domain}
   is the DNS domain within which Web services have been advertised.
   The RDATA of the PTR records associated MUST specify the names of EPR
   resource records advertised within the domain.


   For example:


     > nslookup -q=PTR _services._ws.example.com
     _services._ws.example.com PTR mystocks._ws.example.com
                               PTR inquire.uddi._ws.example.com
                               PTR publish.uddi._ws.example.com



3.  Performance considerations


   The DNS-EPD resource records have been designed to maximize the
   efficiency of queries, allowing clients to request only the bits of
   information they absolutely require.


   EPR and XML records are cacheable but the TTL values will be variable
   based on the types of Web services they are referring to.
   Infrastructure level services (e.g.  UDDI services) should have
   fairly stable endpoint references that do not change frequently and
   thus can have long TTL values.


   XML fragments stored in DNS are of significant concern given their
   arbitrary nature and potential size.  Great care must be taken in
   their use and appropriate consideration needs to be given to their
   cacheability and the decision to store them in DNS at all (as opposed

Internet-Draft                  DNS-EPD                     October 2004



   to using the WSDL reference option and storing the XML outside of
   DNS).


4.  Security considerations


   DNS-EPD resource records are subject to the same security concerns as
   other existing DNS resource record types.  These concerns include
   spoofing, cache poisoning, and other known types of attacks.
   Addressing how to secure DNS-EPD records from such attacks is
   considered out of scope for this document.  DNS administrators should
   defer to other specifications or methodologies for securing their DNS
   environments to ensure that such attacks are dealt with
   appropriately.


   Specifically, in the absence of DNS-native security measures,
   information requested from DNS would need to be authenticated and
   cryptographically verified for integrity and/or confidentiality using
   mechanisms external to the DNS protocol.  For DNS-WSD, this could
   include the use of specifications such as OASIS WSS to authenticate
   the endpoints advertised in the DNS registry following discovery but
   prior to service invocation, or integrity and/or confidently
   protecting  the DNS-WSD artifacts stored in the DNS.


   DNS-EPD introduces no new security concerns to either DNS or the Web
   services architecture as the existing Web services architecture is
   already dependent on the existing security (or lack thereof) of DNS
   architecture.


   Further, DNS Administrators should segregate mission critical
   statically managed DNS services from DNS services that allow dynamic,
   and possibly arbitrary, zone updates and properly delegate the
   administration of zones containing Web service advertisements.


   Other existing DNS administration best practices should continue to
   be followed.


5.  IANA considerations


   This specification would require IANA to allocate RR type codes for
   the EPR and XML resource records.


   The registration of new encoding byte flag values for the XML
   resource record would need to be allocated by IANA following IETF
   consensus.  Submission documents detailing new encoding byte flag
   values MUST specify, at a minimum, whether or not the value
   identifies a character or binary encoding and MUST specify the
   version of XML used.

      > nslookup -q=SRV _http._tcp.example.com
      _http._tcp.example.com SRV 0 0 80 services.example.com


   Client may either construct a simple EndpointReference from the
   information contained in the EPR resource record or use the one
   provided in the associated XML record.
