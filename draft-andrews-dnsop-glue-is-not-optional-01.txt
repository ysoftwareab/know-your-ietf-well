             Glue In DNS Referral Responses Is Not Optional
              draft-andrews-dnsop-glue-is-not-optional-01

Abstract

   The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the
   addresses of nameservers that live within the delegated zone.  Glue
   records are expected to be returned as part of a referral and if they
   cannot be fitted into the UDP response, TC=1 MUST be set to inform
   the client that the response is incomplete and that TCP SHOULD be
   used to retrieve the full response.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS [RFC1034], [RFC1035] uses glue records to allow iterative
   clients to find the addresses of nameservers that live within the
   delegated zone.  Glue records are expected to be returned as part of
   a referral and if they cannot be fitted into the UDP response, TC=1
   MUST be set to inform the client that the response is incomplete and
   that TCP SHOULD be used to retrieve the full response.

   While not common, real life examples of servers that fail to set TC=1
   when glue records are available exist and they do cause resolution
   failures.  The example below shows a case where none of the glue
   records, present in the zone, fitted into the available space and
   TC=1 was not set in the response.  While this example shows an DNSSEC
   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035] referral response, this behaviour has
   also been seen with plain DNS responses as well.  The records have
   been truncated for display purposes.

   This is almost certainly due a wide spread misbelief that all
   additional section records are optional.  This has never been the
   case with respect to glue records and later protocol extension have
   added more cases where records in the additional section are not
   optional in the response.  This includes TSIG [RFC2845], OPT
   [RFC6891], and SIG(0) [RFC2931].

   Glue records are added to the parent zone as part of the delegation
   process.  They are expected to be returned as part of a referral and
   if they can't fit in a UDP response TC=1 MUST be set to signal to the
   client to retry over TCP.  This document reinforces that expectation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Modifications to RFC1034

   Replace

   "Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the authority section of the
   reply.  Put whatever addresses are available into the additional
   section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not available from
   authoritative data or the cache.  Go to step 4."

   "Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the authority section of the
   reply.  Put whatever addresses are available into the additional
   section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not available from
   authoritative data or the cache.  If glue RRs do not fit set TC=1 in
   the header.  Go to step 4."

3.  Security Considerations

   This document reinforces DNS server behaviour expectations and does
   not introduce new security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no actions for IANA.
