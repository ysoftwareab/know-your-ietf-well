 1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
    RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
    the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
    accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
    Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
    Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
    MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
    STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,
    RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

 2. Overview

    This MIB module (BPI+ MIB) provides a set of objects required for
    the management of the Baseline Privacy Interface Plus features of
    DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 2.0 Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem
    Termination System (CMTS). The specification is derived from the
    operational model described in the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy Interface
    Plus Specification [1].

    DOCSIS Baseline Privacy Plus is composed of four distinct
    functional and manageable areas:

    o    Key Exchange and Data Encryption

    o    Cable Modem Authentication

    o    Multicast Encryption

    o    Authentication of Downloaded Software Images

    This MIB module is an extension of the DOCSIS 1.0 Baseline Privacy
    MIB module [RFC3083] (BPI MIB), which is derived from the
    Operational model described in the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy Interface
    Specification [2].  The original Baseline Privacy MIB structure
    has been mostly preserved in the Baseline Privacy Plus MIB.
    Please note that the referenced DOCSIS specifications only require 
    Cable Modems to process IPv4 customer traffic. Design choices in 
    this MIB reflect those requirements. Future versions of the DOCSIS
    specifications are expected to require support for IPv6 as well.


 2.1 Structure of the MIB

    This MIB module is structured into several tables and objects:


 2.1.1. Cable Modem

    o    The docsBpi2CmBaseTable contains authorization key exchange
         information for one CM MAC interface.

    o    The docsBpi2CmTEKTable contains traffic key exchange and
         data encryption information for a particular security
         association ID of the cable modem.

    o    Multicast Encryption information is maintained under
         Docsbpi2CmMulticastObjects.  There is currently one multicast

                          DOCSIS BPI Plus MIB           September 2004

         table object which manages IP multicast encryption,
         docsBpi2CmIpMulticastMapTable.

    o    Digital certificates used for cable modem authentication are
         accessible via docsBpi2CmDeviceCertTable.

    o    Cryptographic suite capabilities for a CM MAC are maintained
         in the docsBpi2CmCryptoSuiteTable.


 2.1.2. Cable Modem Termination System

    o    The docsBpi2CmtsBaseTable contains default settings and
         summary counters for the cable modem termination system.

    o    The DocsBpi2CmtsAuthTable contains Authorization Key Exchange
         information for each CM MAC interface, as well as data
         from CM certificates used in cable modem authentication.

    o    The docsBpi2CmtsTEKTable contains traffic key exchange and
         data encryption information for a particular security
         association ID.

    o    Multicast Encryption information is maintained under
         Docsbpi2CmtsMulticastObjects.  There are currently two
         multicast table objects. The Table
         docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMapTable is specifically designed
         for IP multicast encryption, whereas
         docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthTable is meant to manage all
         multicast security associations.

           In particular, the table docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMapTable
           defines the object docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMask which could
           be a non-contiguous netmask; this is why the object syntax
           is based on the INET-ADDRESS-MIB MIB Module [RFC3291]
           Textual Convention InetAddress instead of
           InetAddressPrefixLength.

           This is to facilitate the assignment of same DOCSIS Security
           Association ID (SAID) to one or more IPv6  multicast group
           ID(s) matching one or more IPv6 multicast scope types within
           an entry in this table.
           For example, multicast scopes labeled "unassigned" [RFC3513]
           may be allocated by administrators to a particular SAID
           regardless of their multicast scope; such mapping
           transient multicast group 'Y' to SAID 'z' for ANY multicast
           scope. The non-contiguous netmask will be FF10:Y, see
           [RFC3513] for details on IPv6 multicast addressing.

    o    DocsBpi2CmtsCertObjects contains 2 manageable tables: one
         for provisioned cable modem certificates and one for
         certification authority certificates.


 2.1.3. Common

    o    The docsBpi2CodeDownloadControl objects manage the
         authenticated software download process for a given device.

 2.2 Relationship of BPI+ and BPI MIB Modules

    This section describes the relationship between the BPI+ MIB module
    defined in this document and the BPI MIB module defined in RFC 3083
    [RFC3083]. The BPI+ protocol interface is an enhancement to the BPI
    protocol and it is a distinct protocol from BPI. The associated BPI+
    managed objects should be considered separate from the BPI MIB
    objects defined in RFC 3083.

    DOCSIS 1.1 and 2.0 systems implement both the BPI+ and BPI protocols
    to be backward compatible with 1.0 systems. For more information
    regarding the interoperability between BPI and BPI+ compliant
    systems, refer to appendix C of the DOCSIS BPI+ specification
    [1] and for MIB modules requirements, refers to section 4.6.1,
    Figure 9 of the DOCSIS 1.1 OSSI specification [3] and section
     7.6.1, Table 7-9 of the DOCSIS 2.0 OSSI specification [4].


 2.3 BPI+ MIB module relationship with The Interfaces Group MIB

    The BPI+ MIB module is the management framework of Baseline Privacy
    Plus Interface Specification [1], which provides the MAC layer
    (Media Access Control) security Services of DOCSIS.
    The BPI+ MIB module objects are organized as extensions of the Radio
    Frequency (RF) Interface Management [RFC2670].

    The MIB table structures of this MIB Module are extensions of the
    DOCSIS CATV (Community Antenna Television) MAC layer interface
    (DocsCableMaclayer by [IANA]). In particular the provisions of the
    Interface Group MIB[RFC2863] for counters discontinuities and
    system re-initialization apply to CM and CMTS to validate the
    difference between two consecutive counters polls.

    All BPI+ MIB module counters are 32 bits based on the minimum time
    to wrap-up considerations of [RFC2863] and their possible frequency
    occurrence as BPI+ FSM (Finite State Machine) event counters. see
    [1] for BPI+ FSM parameter guidelines.

 7. Security Considerations

    There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
    module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
    network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-
    secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
    effect on network operations.  These are the tables and objects
    and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

    - The following objects, if SNMP SET maliciously could constitute
    a denial  of service, theft of service attacks or compromise the
    intended data privacy of users:

       Objects related to the Baseline Privacy Key Management (BPKM)

           docsBpi2CmAuthReset,
           docsBpi2CmtsAuthCmReset,
           docsBpi2CmtsTEKReset:
               These objects are used for initiating a re-key process.
               A malicious massive SET attack may cause CMTS
               processing overload and may compromise the service.

           docsBpi2CmtsDefaultAuthLifetime,
           docsBpi2CmtsDefaultTEKLifetime,
           docsBpi2CmtsAuthCmLifetime,
           docsBpi2CmtsTEKLifetime:
               Implementers are encouraged to follow these objects
               range constrains defined in docsBpi2CmtsCompliance

               MODULE-COMPLIANCE clause for operational deployments
               to minimize the risk of malicious or unintended short
               periods of time for keys updates that may lead into
               degradation or denial of service.

           docsBpi2CmtsDefaultSelfSignedManufCertTrust:
               A malicious SET in a self-signed certificate as
               'untrusted' may cause CM to receive an authorization
               reject message which may constitute denial of
               service. This object is designed for testing purposes,
               Therefore is not RECOMMENDED to be used for commercial
               Deployments [1].  Administrators can make usage of
               View-based Access Control (VACM) introduced in section
               7.9 of [RFC3410] to restrict write access to this object.

           docsBpi2CmtsCheckCertValidityPeriods:
               A malicious SET in this object enabling the period
               validity plus a wrong clock time in the CMTS, could
               cause denial of service as CM authorization requests
               will be rejected.

           For more details in the validation of CM certificates,
           refer to section 9 of [1].

       Objects related to the CM only:

           Objects in docsBpi2CmDeviceCertTable
           docsBpi2CmDeviceCmCert:
               This object is not harmful considering that a CM
               received a Certificate during the manufacturing process.
               Therefore the object access becomes read-only. See
               the object DESCRIPTION clause in section 3 for details.

         Objects for Secure Software Download in table
         docsBpi2CodeDownloadControl:

         docsBpi2CodeCvcUpdate:
               A malicious SNMP SET on this object may not constitute
               a risk since the CM holds the DOCSIS root key to 
               verified the CVC authenticity. Operator if configured,
               could receive a notification for those events occurrences
               that may lead to detect the source of the attack.
               Moreover, [1] recommends that CMs CVC are regularly
               updated to minimize the risk of potential code-signing
               keys being (e.g. by configuration file)

       Objects related to the CMTS only:

           Objects in docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertTable and

           docsBpi2CmtsCACertTable  containing CM Certificates and
           Certificate Authority information respectively:

           docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertTrust,
           docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertStatus,
           docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCert,
           docsBpi2CmtsCACertStatus,
           docsBpi2CmtsCACert:
               Malicious SET on these objects may constitute a denial
               of service attack that will be experienced after the CMs
               perform authorization requests. It does not affect
               CMs in the authorized state.

           Objects in multicast tables docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMapTable
           and docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthTable:

           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastAddressType,
           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastAddress,
           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMaskType,
           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMask,
           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastSAId,
           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastSAType:
               Malicious SET on these objects may cause
               mis-configuration causing interruption of the users
               active multicast applications.

           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastDataEncryptAlg,
           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastDataAuthentAlg:
               Malicious SETs on these objects may create service mis-
               configuration causing service interruption or theft of
               service if encryption algorithms are removed for the
               multicast groups.

           docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMapControl,
           docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthControl:
               Malicious SETs on these objects may remove and/or
               disable customers and/or multicast groups causing
               service disruption. Also may constitute theft of service
               by authorizing non subscribed user to multicast groups
               or by adding other multicast groups in the forward path.


    Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects
    with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
    sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
    important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these
    objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects
    when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables
    and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

                          DOCSIS BPI Plus MIB           September 2004


         Objects in docsBpi2CmBaseTable, docsBpi2CmTEKTable,
         docsBpi2CmtsBaseTable, docsBpi2CmtsAuthTable,
         docsBpi2CmtsTEKTable, docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertTable and
         docsBpi2CmtsCACertTable
           If accessible, attackers may use this information to
           discriminate users configured to work without data
           encryption (e.g. docsBpi2CmPrivacyEnable) and to know
           current Baseline Privacy parameters in the network.

         Objects in docsBpi2CmIpMulticastMapTable and
         docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthTable
           In addition to the vulnerabilities around BPI plus
           multicast objects described in a previous apart, the
           read-only objects of this table may help attackers to
           monitor the status of the intrusion

         Objects in docsBpi2CodeDownloadControl
           In addition to the vulnerability of the read-write object
           docsBpi2CodeCvcUpdate, Attackers may be able to monitor the
           status of a denial of service using Secure Software
           Download.

    SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
    Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
    even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
    allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
    objects in this MIB module.

    It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
    as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
    including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
    (for authentication and privacy).

    Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
    RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
    enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
    responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
    instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access
    to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
    legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.

    BPI+ Encryption Algorithms:
    BPI+ Traffic Encryption Keys TEK (see [1]) uses DES
    (Data Encryption Standard) 56 or 40 bits encryption ciphers.
    Due DES cryptographic strength weakness, future revisions of BPI+
    specification [1] should introduce advanced encryption algorithms
    to overcome the progress in cheaper and faster decryption tools.


 Green/Ozawa/Katsnelson/Cardona     Expires   March 2005      [Page 81]

                          DOCSIS BPI Plus MIB           September 2004

    Traffic Encryption Keys (TEK) are configured per CM and per BPI+
    multicast group which may reduce the threat of the DES weakness for
    the overall system. The time to crack DES could be additionally
    mitigated by a compromised value for the TEK lifetime and Grace Time
    (up to a minimum of 30 minutes for the TEK lifetime, see
    Appendix A [1]).
    Not exempt of the same recommendations as above, The CM BPI+
    Authorization protocol uses triple DES encryption,
    which offers improved robustness compared to DES for CM
    Authorization and TEK re-key management.



 8. IANA Considerations
    The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

    Descriptor     OBJECT IDENTIFIER Value
    ----------     -----------------------
    docsBpi2MIB    { docsIfMib yy }

    Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
    requested to assign a value for yy under the docsIfMib  subtree and
    to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
    assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace yy
    (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
    this note.
