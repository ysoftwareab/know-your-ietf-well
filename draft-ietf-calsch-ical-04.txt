Abstract


   There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
   and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
   and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended
   for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This memo
   has been defined to provide the a definition of a common format for
   openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
   Internet.

   This memo is formatted as a registration for a MIME media type per
   [RFC 2048]. However, the format in this memo is equally applicable
   for use outside of a MIME message content type.

   The proposed media type value is ''TEXT/CALENDAR''. This string would
   label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information
   encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below.

   This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
   calendar event and to-do information. It also can be used to convey
   free/busy time information. The content type is suitable as a MIME
   message entity that can be transferred over MIME based email systems
   or using HTTP. In addition, the content type is useful as an object

   for interactions between desktop applications using the operating
   system clipboard, drag/drop or file systems capabilities.

   This memo is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar specification
   for the exchange of personal calendaring and scheduling information.
   In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work, this memo is
   to be known as the iCalendar specification. This memo is based on the
   calendaring and scheduling model defined in []. The document is also
   the basis for the calendaring and scheduling interoperability
   protocol defined in [ITIP].

   This memo also includes the format for defining iCalendar object
   methods. An iCalendar object method is a set of usage constraints for
   the iCalendar object. For example, these methods might define
   scheduling messages that request an event be scheduled, reply to an
   event request, send a cancellation notice for an event, modify or
   replace the definition of an event, provide a counter proposal for an
   original event request, delegate an event request to another
   individual, request free or busy time, reply to a free or busy time
   request, or provide similar scheduling messages for a to-do or
   journal entry calendar component.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


Introduction


   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology. However, the longer term growth of
   calendaring and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of
   Internet standards for the message content types that are central to
   these groupware applications. This memo is intended to progress the
   level of interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring and
   scheduling applications. This memo defines a MIME content type for
   exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information. The
   Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, or
   iCalendar, allows for the capture and exchange of information
   normally stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such
   as a Personal Information Manager or a Group Scheduling product.

   The calendaring and scheduling model implemented by this memo is
   defined in the [ICMS].

   The format is suitable as an exchange format between applications or
   systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME content type. This
   will enable the object to be exchanged using several transports,
   including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file system, desktop
   interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-based clipboard or
   drag/drop interactions, point-to-point asynchronous communication,
   wired-network transport, or some form of unwired transport such as
   infrared might also be used.

   The definition of a calendaring and scheduling interoperability
   protocol is the subject of another memo [ITIP].

   The memo also provides for the definition of iCalendar object methods
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments, to-dos and
   journal entries. The iCalendar object methods can be used to define
   other calendaring and scheduling operations such a requesting for and
   replying with free/busy time data.

   The memo also includes a formal grammar for the content type to aid
   in the implementation of parsers and to serve as the definitive
   reference when ambiguities or questions arise in interpreting the
   descriptive prose definition of the memo.

2.      Basic Grammar and Conventions


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interopreted as described in [RFC 2119].

   This memo makes use of both a descriptive prose and a more formal
   notation for defining the calendaring and scheduling format.



Dawson/Stenerson                   5                   Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   The notation used in this memo is the augmented BNF notation of [RFC
   822]. Readers intending on implementing this format defined in this
   memo should be familiar with this notation in order to properly
   interpret the specifications of this memo.

   All numeric and hexadecimal values used in this memo are given in
   decimal notation. All names of properties, property parameters,
   enumerated property values and property parameter values are case-
   insensitive. However, all other property values are case-sensitive,
   unless otherwise stated.

        Note: All indented editorial notes, such as this one, are
        intended to provide the reader with additional information that
        is not essential to the building of a conformant implementation
        of the specifications of this memo. The information is provided
        to highlight a particular feature or characteristic of the
        specifications.

   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   [MIME DIR] content type. While the iCalendar object is not a profile
   of the [MIME DIR] content type, it does reuse a number of the
   elements from the [MIME DIR] specification.

2.1     Formatting Conventions


   The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in propose. In order
   to refer to elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core
   object or interoperability protocol defined in this memo, [ICMS] and
   [ITIP], some formatting conventions have been used. Calendaring and
   scheduling roles defined by [ICMS] are referred to in quoted-strings
   of text with the first character of each word in upper case. For
   example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" within the
   scheduling protocol defined by [ITIP] Calendar components defined by
   this memo are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text.
   All calendar components start with the letter "V". For example,
   "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component, "VTODO" refers to
   the to-do calendar component and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily
   journal calendar component. Scheduling methods defined by [ITIP] are
   referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example,
   "REQUEST" refers to the method for requesting a scheduling calendar
   component be created or modified, "REPLY" refers to the method a
   recipient of a request uses to update their status with the
   "Organizer" of the calendar component.

   The properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
   "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey
   the calendar address of a calendar user. Property parameters defined
   by this memo are referred to with lower case, quoted-strings of text,
   followed by the word "parameter". For example, "value" parameter
   refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override the
   default data type for a property value. Enumerated values defined by

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   this memo are referred to with capitalized text, either alone or
   followed by the word "value".

2.2     Related Memos


   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards. This memo, [ICAL], specifies a core
   specification of objects, data types, properties and property
   parameters.

   [ICMS] - specifies a common terminology and abstract;

   [ITIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling
   between different implementations;

   [IMIP] specifies an Internet email binding for [ITIP];

   [IRIP] - specifies an Internet real time protocol binding for [ITIP].

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

3.      TEXT/CALENDAR Registration Information


   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification is intended
   for use as a MIME content type. However, the implementation of the
   memo is in no way limited solely as a MIME content type.

   The following text is intended to register this memo as the MIME
   content type "text/calendar".

     To: ietf-types@uninett.no

     Subject: Registration of MIME content type text/calendar.

     MIME media type name: text

     MIME subtype name: calendar

     Required parameters: method

     The "method" parameter is used to convey the iCalendar object
     method to which the calendaring and scheduling information
     pertains. It also is an identifier for the set of properties that
     the iCalendar object will consist of. The parameter is to be used
     as a guide for applications interpreting the information contained
     within the body part. It should NOT be used to exclude or require
     particular pieces of information unless the identified method
     definition specifically calls for this behavior. Unless
     specifically forbidden by a particular method definition, a



Dawson/Stenerson                   7                   Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


     text/calendar content type MAY contain any set of properties
     permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
     Specification.

     The value for the "method" parameter is defined as follows:

        method  = <Identifier for any IANA registered iCalendar
                   object method>

     Optional parameters: charset, component

     The "charset" parameter is defined in [RFC 2046] for other body
     parts. It is used to identify the default character set used within
     the body part.

     The "component" parameter conveys the type of iCalendar calendar
     component within the body part. If the iCalendar object contains
     more than one calendar component, then the components are specified
     as a comma-separated list of values.

     The value for the "component" parameter is defined as follows:

        component       = "VEVENT" / "VTODO" / "VJOURNAL" / "VFREEBUSY"
                        / x-token / iana-comp

        x-token = <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with
                   no intervening white space, by any atom, where
                   atom is from section 3.3 of [RFC 822]>

        iana-comp = <A publicly defined extension component,
                     registered with IANA, as specified by this
                     document>

     Optional content header fields: Any header fields defined by [RFC
     2045].

     Encoding considerations: This MIME content type can contain 8bit
     characters, so the use of quoted-printable or base64 MIME content-
     transfer-encodings MAY be necessary when iCalendar objects are
     transferrred across protocols restricted to the 7bit repertoire.
     Note that each property in the content entity MAY also have special
     characters encoded using a BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92)
     escapement technique. This means that content values MAY end up
     encoded twice.

     Security considerations: SPOOFING - - In this memo, the "Organizer"
     is the only person authorized to make changes to an existing
     "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" calendar component and redistribute
     the updates to the "Attendees". An iCalendar object that
     maliciously changes or cancels an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO" or
     "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar component MAY be constructed by
     someone other than the "Organizer" and sent to the "Attendees". In
     addition in this memo, an "Attendee" of a "VEVENT", "VTODO",
     "VJOURNAL" calendar component is the only person authorized to


Dawson/Stenerson                   8                   Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


     update any parameter associated with their "ATTENDEE" property and
     send it to the "Organizer". An iCalendar object that maliciously
     changes the "ATTENDEE" parameters MAY be constructed by someone
     other than the real "Attendee" and sent to the "Organizer".

     PROCEDURAL ALARMS - - An iCalendar object can be created that
     contains a "VEVENT" and "VTODO" calendar component with an "VALARM"
     calendar components. The "VALARM" calendar component MAY be of type
     PROCEDURE and MAY have an attachment containing some sort of
     executable program. Implementations that incorporate these types of
     alarms are subject to any virus or malicious attack that MAY occur
     as a result of executing the attachment.

     ATTACHMENTS - - An iCalendar object MAY include references to
     Uniform Resource Locators that MAY be programmed resources.

     Implementers and users of this memo should be aware of the network
     security implications of accepting and parsing such information. In
     addition, the security considerations observed by implementations
     of electronic mail systems should be followed for this memo.

     Interoperability considerations: This MIME content type is intended
     to define a common format for conveying calendaring and scheduling
     information between different systems. It is heavily based on the
     earlier [VCAL] industry specification.

     Intended Usage: COMMON

4.      iCalendar Object Specification


   The following sections define the details of a Calendaring and
   Scheduling Core Object Specification. This information is intended to
   be an integral part of the MIME content type registration. In
   addition, this information MAY be used independent of such content



Dawson/Stenerson                   9                   Expires MAY 1998

   registration. In particular, this memo has direct applicability for
   use as a calendaring and scheduling exchange format in file-, memory-
   or network-based transport mechanisms.

4.1     Content Considerations


   The iCalendar object consists of lines of text. This section defines
   how the content lines MUST be formatted.

4.1.1   Content Lines


   The iCalendar object consists of individual lines of text, delimited
   by a line break, which is a CRLF sequence (ASCII decimal 13, followed
   by ASCII decimal 10). Line of text should not be longer than 76
   characters, excluding the line break.

   Long lines of text can be split into a multiple line representations
   using a line "folding" technique. That is, a long line MAY be split
   at any point by inserting a CRLF immediately followed by a single
   LWSP character (i.e., SPACE, ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, ASCII decimal
   9). Any sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single LWSP
   character is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content
   type.

   For example the line:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description
       that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple line representation
   to its single line representation is called "unfolding". Unfolding is
   accomplished by removing the CRLF character and the LWSP character
   that immediately follows.

   An intentional formatted text line break MAY only be included in a
   property value by representing the line break with the character
   sequence of BACKSLASH (ASCII decimal 92), followed by a LATIN SMALL
   LETTER N (ASCII decimal 110) or a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N (ASCII
   decimal 78), that is "\n" or "\N".

   For example a multiple line "DESCRIPTION" property value of:

     Project XYZ Final Review
     Conference Room - 3B
     Come Prepared.

   Could be represented as:

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


     DESCRIPTION:Project_XYZ Final_Review\n
      Conference Room - 3B\nCome_Prepared.

   The content information associated with an iCalendar object is
   formatted using a syntax similar to that defined by [MIME DIR]. That
   is, the content information consists of one or more CRLF-separated
   content lines as defined by the following notation:

     contentline = name [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws] value CRLF
     ;Folding permitted on content lines.
     ;Lines should be less than 76 characters, excluding CRLF.

     LWSP       = SPACE / HTAB

     SPACE      = <ASCII Decimal 32>

     HTAB       = <ASCII Decimal 9>

     ws         = SPACE / HTAB

     name       = iana-name / x-name    ;An iCalendar property

     iana-name  = <One of the properties defined by this memo or
                   an IANA registered property, as defined by the
                   registration process in this memo.>

     x-name     = <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with no

4.1.2   List and Field Separators


   List of values MAY be specified for property values or property
   parameter values. Each value in a list of values MUST be separated by
   a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). A COMMA character in a property
   value or a property parameter value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH
   character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Some property values are defined in terms of multiple components.
   These structured property values MUST have their components separated
   by a SEMICOLON character (ASCII decimal 59). A SEMICOLON character in
   a property value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (ASCII
   decimal 92).

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   Lists of property parameters MAY be specified for a property. Each
   property parameter in a list of property parameters MUST be separated
   by a SEMICOLON character (ASCII decimal 59). A SEMICOLON character in
   a property parameter value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character
   (ASCII decimal 92).

   A COLON character (ASCII decimal 58) in a property parameter value
   MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92). A
   COLON character in a property value does not need to be escaped with
   a BACKSLASH character.

   A BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92) in a property value or a
   property parameter value MUST be escaped with another BACKSLASH
   character.

   For example, in the following properties a SEMICOLON is used to
   separate property parameters and property value fields. A COMMA is
   used to separate values.

     ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE;ROLE=ATTENDEE:J.Smith <jsmith@host.com>

     RDATE;VALUE=DATE:19970304,19970504,19970704,19970904

4.1.3   Multiple Values


   Each property defined in the iCalendar object MAY have multiple
   values, if allowed in the definition of the specific property. The
   general rule for encoding multi-valued items is to simply create a
   new content line for each value; including the property name.
   However, it should be noted that some properties support encoding
   multiple values in a single property by separating the values with a
   COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44).

4.1.4   Binary Content


   There is no support for including binary content information, inline,
   within an iCalendar object. Binary content information MUST be
   referenced by a uniform resource locator (URL) type of property
   value.

   The following example specifies an "ATTACH" property with a reference
   to an attachment consisting of a binary object:

     ATTACH:ftp://xyz.com/public/quarterly-report.doc

4.1.5   Property Parameters


   A property MAY have additional attributes associated with it. These
   "property parameters" contain meta information about the property or
   the property value. Property parameters MAY be used to specify the
   location of an alternate text representation for a property value,
   the content encoding used on a property value, the language of a text
   property value or thedata type of the property value.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   Property parameter values that contain the COLON, SEMICOLON, COMMA or
   BACKSLASH character separators MUST be specified as quoted-string
   text values. For example:

     DESCRIPTION;ALTREP="http://www.wiz.org":The Fall'98 Wild Wizards
       Conference - - Las Vegas, NV, USA

   Property parameters are defined by the following notation:

     (  = parameter *(";" [ws] parameter)

     parameter  = altrepparm            ;Alterate text representation
                / languageparm          ;Text language
                / valuetypeparm         ;Property value data type
                / [parmtype "="] parmvalues ;Parameter extensions

     parmtype   = x-token / iana-ptype

     iana-ptype = <A publicly defined extension parameter type,
                   registered with IANA, as specified in this memo>

     parmvalues = parmvalue / parmvalue *("," [ws] parmvalue)

     parmvalue  = x-name / iana-pvalue

     iana-pvalue = <A publicly defined extension parameter value,
                    registered with IANA, as specified in this memo>

4.1.6   Alternate Text Representation


   The "ALTREP" property parameter is an OPTIONAL property parameter. It
   specifies the URL that points to an alternate representation for a
   textual property value. The property MUST include a value that
   reflects the default representation. This property parameter MAY
   include multiple values, separated by the COMMA character (ASCII
   decimal 44). The property parameter MAY only be specified in the
   "COMMENT", "CONTACT", "DESCRIPTION", "LOCATION" and "SUMMARY"
   properties.

   For example:

     DESCRIPTION;ALTREP="CID:<part3.msg.970415T083000@host.com>":Project
       XYZ Review Meeting will include the following agenda items: (a)
       Market Overview, (b) Finances, (c) Project Management

   The "ALTREP" property parameter value might point to a "text/html"
   content portion.

     Content-Type:text/html
     Content-Id:<part3.msg.970415T083000@host.com>

     <p><b>Project XYZ Review Meeting</b> will include the following
     agenda items:<li>Market
     Overview</li><li>Finances</li><li>Project Management</li></p>

   The "ALTREP" property parameter is defined by the following notation:

     altrepparm = "altrep" "=" urltype

     urltype    = <quoted-string text URL value>

4.1.7   Character Set


   There is not a property parameter to declare the character set used
   in a property value. The default character set for an iCalendar
   object is [UTF-8].

   The "charset" Content-Type parameter MAY be used in MIME transports
   to specify any other IANA registered character set.

4.1.8   Language


   The "LANGUAGE" property parameter MAY be used to identify the
   language used in text values. The value of the "language" property
   parameter is that defined in [RFC 1766].

        Note: For transport in a MIME entity, the Content-Language
        header field MAY be used to set the default language for the
        entire body part.

   The "LANGUAGE" property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

     languageparm =     "language" "=" language

     language = <Text identifying a language, as defined in [RFC 1766]>

4.1.9   Value Data Types


   The "VALUE" property parameter is an OPTIONAL property parameter. It
   is used to identify the data type and format of the property value.
   The values of a property MUST only be of a single data type. For
   example, a "RDATE" property can not have a combination of DATE-TIME
   and TIME values.

   The "VALUE" property parameter is defined by the following notation:

     valuetypeparm = "value" "=" valuetype

     valuetype  = "boolean"
                / "cal-address"
                / "date"
                / "date-time"
                / "duration"

                / x-token
                / iana-value

     iana-value = <A publicly defined extension value type, registered
                   with IANA, as specified by this memo>

   The following data types are defined by this memo.

4.1.9.1 Boolean


   The "BOOLEAN" data type is used to identify properties that contain
   either a "true" or a "false" boolean value. These values are case
   insensitive. The data type is defined by the following notation:

     boolean    = "TRUE" / "FALSE"

   For example, any of the following are equivalent:

     TRUE
     true
     TrUe

4.1.9.2 Calendar User Address


   The "CAL-ADDRESS" data type is used to identify properties that
   contain an address of a calendar user. The phrase component of the
   address MAY be used to match an unknown address with an otherwise
   known individual, group, or resource. The data type is as defined by
   the following notation:

     cal-address        = addr-spec / phrase "<" addr-spec ">"

     addr-spec  = local-part "@" domain         ;RFC 822 style address
     local-part = WORD *("." WORD)
     domain     = domain-ref *("." domain-ref)
     domain-ref = ATOM

     phrase     = 1*WORD
     WORD       = ATOM / quoted-string
     quoted-string = <"> *(qtext/quoted-pair) <"> ; Regular qtext or
                                                  ;   quoted chars.
     qtext      = <any CHAR excepting <">,        ; => MAY be folded
                  "\" & CR, and including linear-
                  white-space>
     quoted-pair ="\" CHAR                        ; MAY quote any char

     CHAR       = <any a character from the
                  selected character set>
     ATOM       = 1*<any CHAR except specials,
                  SPACE and CTLs>

4.1.9.3 Date


   The "DATE" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   calendar date. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete
   representation, basic format for a calendar date. The text format
   specifies a four-digit year, two-digit month, and two-digit day of
   the month. There are no separator characters between the year, month
   and day component text. The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     date-fullyear      = 4DIGIT
     date-month         = 2DIGIT        ;01-12
     date-mday          = 2DIGIT        ;01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31
                                        ;based on month/year

     date               = date-fullyear date-month date-mday

   For example, the following represents July 14, 1997:

     19970714

4.1.9.4 Date-Time


   The "DATE-TIME" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise calendar date and time of day. The format is expressed as the
   [ISO 8601] complete representation, basic format for a calendar date
   and time of day. The text format is a concatenation of the "date",
   followed by the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (ASCII decimal 84)
   time designator, followed by the "time" format defined above. The
   data type is defined by the following notation:

     date-time  = date "T" time ;As specified above in date and time

   The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in UTC and the
   equivalent time in New York (four hours behind UTC in DST), expressed
   as a local time and local time with UTC offset:

     19970714T133000Z
     19970714T083000
     19970714T083000-0400

4.1.9.5 Duration


   The "DURATION" data type is used to identify properties that contain
   a duration of time. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] basic
   format for the duration of time. The format can represent durations

   in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The
   data type is defined by the following notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     dur-second = 1*DIGIT "S"
     dur-minute = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
     dur-hour   = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
     dur-time   = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)

     dur-week   = 1*DIGIT "W"
     dur-day    = 1*DIGIT "D"
     dur-month  = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-day]
     dur-year   = 1*DIGIT "Y" [dur-month]
     dur-date   = (dur-day / dur-month / dur-year) [dur-time]

     duration   = "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)

   For example, a duration of 10 years, 3 months, 15 days, 5 hours, 30
   minutes and 20 seconds would be:

     P10Y3M15DT5H30M20S

4.1.9.6 Float


   The "FLOAT" data type is used to identify properties that contain a
   real value number value. If the property permits, multiple "float"
   values MAY be specified using a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separator character. The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     float      = ["+" / "-"] *DIGIT ["." *DIGIT]

   For example:

     1000000.0000001
     1.333
     -3.14

4.1.9.7 Integer


   The "INTEGER" data type is used to identify properties that contain a
   signed integer value. The valid range for "integer" is -2147483648 to
   2147483647. If the sign is not specified, then the value is assumed
   to be positive. If the property permits, multiple "integer" values
   MAY be specified using a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44) separator
   character. The data type is defined by the following notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     integer    = ["+" / "-"] *DIGIT

     -1234567890
     +1234567890
     432109876

4.1.9.8 Period of Time


   The "PERIOD" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise period of time. There are two forms of a period of time.

   A period of time MAY be identified by it start and its end. This
   format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete representation, basic
   format for "DATE-TIME" start of the period, followed by a SOLIDUS
   character (ASCII decimal 47), followed by the "DATE-TIME" of the end
   of the period. For example, the period starting at 10 AM in Seattle
   (eight hours behind UTC) on January 1, 1997 and ending at 11 PM in
   Seattle on January 1, 1997 would be:

     19970101T100000-0800/19970101T230000-0800

   A period of time MAY also be defined by a start and a duration of
   time. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete
   representation, basic format for the "DATE-TIME" start of the period,
   followed by a SOLIDUS character (ASCII decimal 47), followed by the
   [ISO 8601] basic format for "DURATION" of the period. For example,
   the period start at 10 AM in Seattle (eight hours behind UTC) on
   January 1, 1997 and lasting 5 hours and 30 minutes would be:

     19970101T100000-0800/PT5H30M

   The data type is defined by the following notation:

     period-explicit = date-time "/" date-time
     ;ISO 8601 complete representation basic format for a period of time
     ;consisting of a start and end. The start MUST be before the end.

     period-start = date-time "/" duration
     ;ISO 8601 complete representation basic format for a period of time
     ;consisting of a start and duration of time.

     period     = period-explicit / period-start

4.1.9.9 Recurrence Rule


   The "RECUR" data type is used to identify properties that contain a
   recurrence rule specification. The data type is a structured value
   consisting of a list of one or more recurrence grammar components.
   Each component is defined by a NAME=VALUE pair. The components are
   separated from each other by the SEMICOLON character (ASCII decimal
   59). The components are not ordered in any particular sequence.
   Individual components MAY only be specified once.



Dawson/Stenerson                   18                  Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   The FREQ component identifies the type of recurrence rule. This
   component MUST be specified in the recurrence rule. Valid values
   include MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of
   a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating events based on an
   interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify repeating events based
   on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to specify repeating events
   based on an interval of a week or more; MONTHLY, to specify repeating
   events based on an interval of a month or more; and YEARLY, to
   specify repeating events based on an interval of a year or more.

   The INTERVAL component contains a positive integer representing how
   often the recurrence rule repeats. The default value is "1" or every
   minute for a MINUTELY rule, every hour for a HOURLY rule, every day
   for a DAILY rule, every week for a WEEKLY rule, every month for a
   MONTHLY rule and every year for a YEARLY rule.

   The UNTIL component defines a date-time value which bounds the
   recurrence rule in an inclusive manner. If the value specified by
   UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence, this date-time
   becomes the last instance of the recurrence. If not present, and the
   COUNT component is also not present, the RRULE is considered to
   repeat forever.

   The COUNT component defines the number of occurrences at which to
   range-bound the recurrence. This component is ignored if the "UNTIL"
   component is also present.

   The BYMINUTE component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of minutes within an hour. Valid values are 0 to 60.
   Zero is the beginning of the hour and 60 is the beginning of the next
   hour.

   The BYHOUR component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of hours of the day. Valid values are 0 to 24. Zero is
   the start of the day and 24 is the start of the next day.

   The BYDAY component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of days of the week; MO, indicates Monday; TU,
   indicates Tuesday; WE, indicates Wednesday; TH, indicates Thursday;
   FR, indicates Friday; SA, indicates Saturday; SU, indicates Sunday.

   Each BYDAY values MAY also be preceded by a positive (+n) or negative
   (-n) integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY RRULE. For example, within
   a MONTHLY rule, +1MO (or simply 1MO) represents the first Monday
   within the month, whereas -1MO represents the last Monday of the
   month. If an integer modifier is not present, it means all days of
   this type within the specified frequency. For example, within a
   MONTHLY rule, MO represents all Mondays within the month.

   The BYMONTHDAY component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the month. Valid values are 1 to 31 or
   -31 to -1.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   Each BYMONTHDAY value MAY be preceeded by a postive (+n) or negative
   (-n) integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific day of the month within the MONTHLY rule. If an integer
   modifier is not present, it means all days of this type within the
   specified frequency. For example, within a MONTHLY rule, -10
   represents the tenth to the last day of the month.

   The BYYEARDAY component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the year. Valid values are 1 to 366 or
   -366 to -1. For example, -1 represents the last day of the year
   (December 31st).

   The BYWEEKNO component specifies a comma-separated list of weeks of
   the year. Valid values are 1 to 53. This corresponds to weeks
   according to week numbering as defined in [ISO 8601]. That is, a week
   as "A seven day period within a calendar year, starting on a Monday
   and identified by its ordinal number within the year; the first
   calendar week of the year is the one that includes the first Thursday
   of that year." This component is only valid for YEARLY rules.

   Each BYWEEKNO value MAY be preceded by a positive (+n) or negative (-
   n) integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific week of the year within the YEARLY rule. If an integer
   modifier is not present, it means all days of this type within the
   specified frequency. For example, within a YEARLY rule, 3 represents
   the third week of the year.

   The BYMONTH component specifies a comma separated list of months of
   the year. Valid values are 1 to 12.

   The WKST component specifies the day on which the workweek starts.
   Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA and SU. This is significant
   when a WEEKLY RRULE has an interval greater than 1, and a BYDAY
   component is specified. The default value is MO.

   The BYSETPOS component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of values which corresponds to the nth occurrence
   within the set of events specified by the rule. Valid values are 1 to
   366 or -366 to -1. It MUST only be used in conjunction with another
   Byxxx component. For example "the last work day of the month" could
   be represented as:

     RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1

   If BYxxx component values are found which are beyond the available
   scope (ie, BYMONTHDAY=-30 in February), they are simply ignored

   Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
   various recurrence instance start time and dates are derived from the
   Start Time (DTSTART) entry attribute. For example,
   "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1" doesn’t specify a specific day within the
   month or a time. This information would be the same as what is
   specified for DTSTART.

   BYxxx components modify the recurrence in some manner. BYxxx
   components for a period of time which is the same or greater than the
   frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of the
   recurrence generated. For example, "FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1" reduces the
   number of recurrence instances from all days (if BYMONTH tag is not
   present) to all days in January. BYxxx components for a period of
   time less than the frequency generally increase or expand the number
   of occurrences of the recurrence. For example,
   "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,2" increases the number of days within the
   yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH tag is not present) to 2.

   If only one BYxxx component is specified in the recurrence rule, the
   list of "n" unique values would cause "n" occurrences of the
   recurrence within each specified frequency interval, where each
   unique list value is substituted in the appropriate date position
   within DTSTART for each such occurrence.

   If multiple BYxxx components are specified, then the list of "n"
   unique values for each lower frequency BYxxx components is applied to
   the list of "n" unique values for higher frequency BYxxx components.
   This process will not always increase the set of occurrences. If a
   higher component is inconsistent with what was generated for lower
   components, it would reduce the set. The ordering of BYxxx components
   from lower frequency to higher frequency is as follows: BYMINUTE,
   BYHOUR, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYYEARDAY, BYWEEKNO, BYMONTH, BYSETPOS.

   Here is an example of evaluating multiple BYxxx components.

     "FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=2;BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=SU;BYHOUR=8,9;BYMINUTE=30"

   would first apply the "BYMINUTE=30" To "BYHOUR=8,9" to arrive at
   "every 8:30AM and 9:30AM". This in turn would be applied to
   "BYDAY=SU" to arrive at "every Sunday at 8:30AM and 9:30AM". This
   would be applied to "BYMONTH=1" to arrive at "every Sunday in January
   at 8:30AM and 9:30AM". Considering the FREQUENCY and INTERVAL, this
   would become "Every Sunday in January at 8:30AM and 9:30AM, every
   other year". If the BYMINUTE, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYYEARDAY, BYHOUR or
   BYMONTH component was missing, the appropriate mintues, hour, day or
   month would have been retrieved from DTSTART.

   The data type is defined by the following notation:

     recur      = "FREQ"=freq ";"
                [("UNTIL" "=" enddate ";") / ("COUNT" "=" digits ";")]
                ["INTERVAL" "=" digits ";"]
                ["BYMINUTE" "=" byminlist ";"]
                ["BYHOUR" "=" byhrlist ";"]
                ["BYDAY" "=" bywdaylist ";"]
                ["BYMONTHDAY" "=" bymodaylist ";"]

   There are other examples specified in the "RRULE" specification.

4.1.9.10        Text


   The "TEXT" data type is used to identify values that contain human
   readable text. The character set and language in which the text is
   represented is controlled by the "LANGUAGE" property parameters. The
   data type is defined by the following notation:

     text       = <Any character in the selected character set, but
                   not including CRLF>

4.1.9.11        Time


   The "TIME" data type is used to identify values that contain a time
   of day. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete
   representation, basic format for a time of day. The text format
   consists of a two-digit 24-hour of the day (i.e., values 0-23), two-
   digit minute in the hour (i.e., values 0-59), and two-digit seconds
   in the minute (i.e., values 0-59). If seconds of the minute are not
   supported by an implementation, then a value of "00" should be
   specified for the seconds component. Fractions of an hour, minute or
   second are not supported by this format. This format is used to
   represent local time, local time with UTC offset and UTC time. UTC
   time is identified by a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character
   (ASCII decimal 90), the UTC designator, appended to the time. The
   local time with UTC offset is expressed as a local time, suffixed
   with the signed offset from UTC. The UTC offset is express as the 2-
   digit hours and 2-digit minutes difference from UTC. It is expressed
   as positive, with an OPTIONAL leading PLUS SIGN character (ASCII
   decimal 43), if the local time is ahead of UTC. It is expressed as a
   negative, with a leading HYPEN-MINUS character (ASCII decimal 45), if
   the local time is behind UTC. Local time has neither the UTC
   designator nor the UTC offset suffix text. The data type is defined
   by the following notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     time-hour          = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
     time-minute        = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
     time-second        = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
     time-numzone       = ("+" / "-") time-hour time-minute
     time-zone          = "Z" / time-numzone

     time               = time-hour time-minute time-second [time-zone]

   For example, the following represents 8:30 AM in New York, five hours
   behind UTC, in local time and local time with UTC offset. In
   addition, 1:30 PM in UTC is illustrated:

     083000
     083000-0500
     133000Z

   There are cases when a floating time is intended within a property
   value. For example, an event MAY be defined that indicates that an
   individual will be busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day. In these
   cases, a local time MAY be specified. The recipient of an iCalendar
   object with a property value consisting of a local time, without any
   relative time zone information, should interpret the value as being
   fixed to the recipient's locale and time zone. In most cases, a fixed
   time is desired. To properly communicate a fixed time in a property
   value, either UTC, local time with UTC offset, or local time with a
   "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be specified.

4.1.9.12        URL


   The "URL" data type is used to identify values that contain a uniform
   resource locator (URL) type of reference to the property value. This
   data type might be used to reference binary information, for values
   that are large, or otherwise undesirable to include directly in the
   iCalendar object.

   The URL value formats in RFC 1738, RFC 2111 and any other IETF
   registered value format MAY be specified.

   The data type is defined by the following notation:

     url        = <As defined by any IETF RFC>

   Any IANA registered URL type MAY be used. These include, but are not
   limited to, those for FTP and HTTP protocols, file access, content
   identifier and message identifier.

   For example, the following is an URL for a local file:

     file:///my-report.txt

4.1.9.13        UTC Offset


   The "UTC-OFFSET" data type is used to identify properties that
   contain an offset from UTC to local time. The data type is defined by
   the following notation:

     utc-offset = time-numzone  ;As defined above in time data type

   For example, the following are UTC offsets are given for standard
   time for New York (five hours behind UTC) and Geneva (one hour ahead
   of UTC):

     -0500

     +0100

4.2     iCalendar object


   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object is a collection of
   calendaring and scheduling information. Typically, this information
   will consist of a single iCalendar object. However, multiple
   iCalendar objects MAY be sequentially, grouped together. The first
   line and last line of the iCalendar object MUST contain a pair of
   iCalendar object delimiter strings. The syntax for an iCalendar
   object is as follows:

     icalobject = "BEGIN" ":" [ws] "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                  icalbody
                  "END" ":" [ws] "VCALENDAR" CRLF [icalobject]

   The following is a simple example of an iCalendar object:

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     VERSION:2.0
     PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
     BEGIN:VEVENT
     DTSTART:19970714T120000-0500
     DTEND:19970714T235959-0500
     SUMMARY:Bastille Day Party
     END:VEVENT
     END:VCALENDAR

4.3     Property


   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing a
   calendar property or a calendar component. A property takes the
   following form:

     property   = propname [";" [ws] parmlist] ":" [ws] value CRLF

     propname   = <any properties defined in this memo>
                / iana-prop / x-token

     x-token    = <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with no
                   intervening white space, by any atom>

     iana-prop  = <A publicly defined extension property, registered
                   with IANA, as specified by this memo>

   The following is an example of a property:

     DTSTART:19960415T083000-05:00

   This memo places no imposed ordering of properties within an
   iCalendar object.

   Property names, parameter names and parameter values (i.e.,
   everything to the left of the ":" on a line) are case insensitive.
   For example, the property name "DUE" is the same as "due" and "Due".

4.4     Calendar Components


   The body of the iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components. The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar as a whole. The
   calendar components are collections of properties that with a
   particular calendar semantic. For example, the calendar component MAY
   specify a an event, a to-do, journal entry, time zone information, or
   free/busy time information, or alarm.

   The body of the iCalenar Object is defined by the following notation:

     icalbody   = calprops 1*component

     calprops   = [calscale] prodid method [source] [name] version

     component  = 1*(eventc / todoc / journalc / freebusyc /
                / timezonec)

4.4.1   Event Component


   A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of component properties
   and an OPTIONAL "VALARM" calendar component that represent a
   scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it MAY be an
   activity; such as a one-hour, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00
   AM, tomorrow. Generally, these events will take up time on an
   individual calendar. Hence, the event will appear as an opaque
   interval in a search for busy time. Alternately, the event MAY have
   its Time Transparency set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent
   blocking of the event in searches for busy time.

   The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
   anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar. These events have a
   start time but no end time. The start time MAY also be specified as a
   DATE value data type, instead of the default DATE-TIME.

   A "VEVENT" calendar component is defined by the following notation:

     eventc     = "BEGIN" ":" [ws] "VEVENT" CRLF
                  eventprop *alarmc
                  "END" ":" [ws] "VEVENT" CRLF

     eventprop  = *attach *attendee *categories [class] *comment
                  *contact [created] [description] [dtend / duration]

                  *rrule dtstamp [seq] [status] summary [transp] uid
                  *url [recurid]

   The "VEVENT" calendar component can not be nested within another
   calendar component. The "VEVENT" calendar components MAY be related
   to each other or to a "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component with
   the "RELATED-TO" property.

   The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component used
   to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to searches for busy
   time:

     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123401@host.com

     SUMMARY:Annual Employee Review
     CLASS:PRIVATE
     CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
     END:VEVENT

   The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component used
   to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
   transparent, to searches for busy time:

     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123402@host.com
     DTSTAMP:19970901T1300Z DTSTART:19970401T083000-0800

     SUMMARY:Laurel is in sensitivity awareness class.
     CLASS:PUBLIC
     CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
     TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
     END:VEVENT

   The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component used
   to represent an anniversary that will occur annually. Since it takes
   up no time, it will not appear as opaque in a search for busy time;
   no matter what the value of the "TRANSP" property indicates:

     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123403@host.com

4.4.2   To-do Component


   A "VTODO" calendar component is a grouping of component properties
   and an OPTIONAL "VALARM" calendar component that represent an action-
   item or assignment. For example, it MAY be an item of work assigned
   to an individual; such as "turn in travel expense today".

   A "VTODO" calendar component is defined by the following notation:

     todoc      = "BEGIN" ":" [ws] "VTODO" CRLF
                  todoprop *alarmc
                  "END" ":" [ws] "VTODO" CRLF

     todoprop   = *attach *attendee *categories [class] *comment
                  [completed] *contact [created] [description] dtstamp
                  dtstart [due / duration] *exdate *exrule [geo]

                  *related *resources *rdate *rrule [recurid] [seq]
                  [status] summary uid *url

   The "VTODO" calendar component can not be nested within another
   calendar component. If "VTODO" calendar components need to be related
   to each other or to a "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component, they
   can specify a relationship with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   The following is an example of a "VTODO" calendar component:

     BEGIN:VTODO
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123404@host.com
     DTSTAMP:19970901T1300Z

4.4.3   Journal Component


   A "VJOURNAL" calendar component is a grouping of component properties
   that represent one or more descriptive text notes on a particular
   calendar date. The "DTSTART" property is used to specify the calendar
   date that the journal entry is associated with. Generally, it will
   have a DATE value data type, but it MAY also be used to specify a
   DATE-TIME value data type. Examples of a journal entry include a
   daily record of a legislative body or a journal entry of individual
   telephone contacts for the day or an ordered list of accomplishments
   for the day. The calendar component can also be used to associate a
   document with a calendar date.

   The "VJOURNAL" calendar component does not take up time on a
   calendar. Hence, it does not play a role in free or busy time
   searches - - it is as though it has a time transparency value of
   TRANSPARENT. It is transparent to any such searches.

   A "VJOURNAL" calendar component is defined by the following notation:

     journalc   = "BEGIN" ":" [ws] "VJOURNAL" CRLF
                  jourprop
                  "END" ":" [ws] "VJOURNAL" CRLF

     jourprop   = *attach *attendee *categories [class] *comment
                  *contact [created] [description] dtstart dtstamp
                  *exdate *exrule [last-mod] *related *rdate *rrule
                  [rstatus] [seq] summary uid *url [recurid]

   The "VJOURNAL" calendar component can not be nested within another
   calendar component. If "VJOURNAL" calendar components need to be
   related to each other or to a "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component,
   they can specify a relationship with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   The following is an example of the "VJOURNAL" calendar component:

     BEGIN:VJOURNAL

4.4.4   Free/Busy Component


   A "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties that represents either a request for, or a reply with,
   free or busy time information. Typically, this component exists in an
   iCalendar object that is being used to either request or return free
   or busy time information.

   A "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is defined by the following
   notation:

     freebusyc  = "BEGIN" ":" [ws] "VFREEBUSY" CRLF
                  fbprop
                  "END" ":" [ws] "VFREEBUSY" CRLF

     fbprop     = fbrequest / fbreply

     fbrequest  = *attendee dtstart dtend [duration] *comment dtstamp
                  [last-mod] *related [seq] uid
     ;This set of properties is used to for free/busy time request.

     fbreply    = *attendee [created] *comment [dtstart dtend] dtstamp
                  *freebusy [last-mod] *related [rstatus] [seq] uid *url
     ;This set of properties is used for free/busy time reply.

   The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component can not be nested within another
   calendar component. The "VFREEBUSY" calendar components MAY be
   related to each other with the "RELATED-TO" property. Multiple
   "VFREEBUSY" calendar components MAY be specified within a iCalendar
   object. This permits the grouping of Free/Busy information into
   logical collections, such as monthly groups of busy time information.

   The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is intended for use in iCalendar
   object methods involving requests for free time, requests for busy
   time, requests for both free and busy, and the associated replies.

   Free/Busy information can be expressed using the "FREEBBUSY"
   property. This property provides a terse representation of time
   periods. One or more "FREEBUSY" properties MAY be specified in the
   "VFREEBUSY" calendar component to describe the Free/Busy information.

   Optionally, the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties MAY be specified to
   express the start and end date and time for all of the Free/Busy
   information in the "VFREEBUSY"calendar component. When present in a
   "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, they should be specified prior to any
   "FREEBUSY" properties. In a free time request, these properties MAY
   be used in combination with the "DURATION" property to express a
   request for a duration of free time within a given window of time.

   The recurrence properties ("RRULE", "EXRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE") are
   not permitted within a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. Any recurring
   events are resolved into their individual busy time periods using the
   "FREEBUSY" property.

   The following is an example of a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component:

     BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
     DTSTART:19971015T050000Z
     DTEND:19971016T050000Z
     FREEBUSY;VALUE=PERIOD:19971015T050000Z/PT8H30M,
      19971015T160000Z/PT5H30M,19971015T223000Z/PT6H30M
     END:VFREEBUSY

4.4.5   Alarm Component


   A "VALARM" calendar component is a grouping of component properties
   that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a to-do. The "VALARM"
   calendar component MAY only be specified in a "VEVENT" or "VTODO"

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   calendar component. For example, it MAY define a reminder for a
   pending event or an overdue to-do.

   The "DTSTART" property specifies the calendar date and time of day
   that the alarm will be triggered. The value MAY alternately be set to
   a period of time, before or after the event or to-do, that the alarm
   will be triggered.

   A "VALARM" calendar component is defined by the following notation:

     alarmc     = "BEGIN" ":" [ws] "VALARM" CRLF
                  alarmprop
                  "END" ":" [ws] "VALARM" CRLF

     alarmprop  = *attach 1*categories *comment [description]
                  dtstart duration *related repeat [summary]

   The "VALARM" calendar component can only appear within either a
   "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component. The "VALARM" calendar
   components can not be nested.

   The following is an example of the "VALARM" calendar component:

     BEGIN:VALARM
     DTSTART:19970317T133000Z
     REPEAT:4
     DURATION:PT15M
     CATEGORIES:DISPLAY,AUDIO
     ATTACH:file:///mmedia/sounds/bell1.wav
     DESCRIPTION:Breakfast meeting with executive team at 8:30 AM
     END:VALARM

4.4.6   Timezone Component


   The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component is used to define a time zone.

   A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time measurement
   rules determined by the governing body for a given geographic area.
   These rules describe at a minimum the base offset from UTC for the
   time zone, often referred to as the Standard Time offset. Many
   locations adjust their Standard Time forward or backward by one hour,
   in order to accommodate seasonal changes in number of daylight hours,
   often referred to as Daylight Saving Time. Some locations adjust
   their time by a fraction of an hour. Standard Time is also known as
   Winter Time. Daylight Saving Time is also known as Advanced Time,
   Summer Time, or Legal Time in certain countries. The following table
   shows the changes in time zone rules for the eastern United States.

   Interoperability between two calendaring and scheduling applications,
   especially for recurring events, to-dos or journal entries, is
   dependent on the ability to capture and convey date and time
   information in an unambiguous format. The specification of current
   time zone information is integral to this behavior.

   The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties that define a time zone description. The time zone
   description specifies the effective Standard Time or Daylight Savings
   Time rules for a particular time zone. The "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component can not be nested within other calendar components. The
   "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MAY be specified multiple times. If
   the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component is missing, the recipient should
   assume all local times are relative to the recipient's time zone. The
   "VTIMEZONE" calendar component should be specified in the iCalendar
   object before any other calendar components.

   A "VTIMEZONE" calendar component is defined by the following
   notation:

     timezonec  = "BEGIN" ":" [ws] "VTIMEZONE" CRLF
                  tzprop
                  "END" ":" [ws] "VTIMEZONE" CRLF

     tzprop     = *comment [daylight] dtstart [rdate / rrule]
                  [tzname] tzoffset

   The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component is important for correct
   interpretation of individual as well as recurring calendar components
   that span a time zone transition. For example, from EST to EDT.  The
   exception to this are calendar components that are considered
   floating (i.e., occurs at a particular local time no matter what time
   zone you are in). If the iCalendar object contains a non-floating
   calendar component that has a recurring date pattern (i.e., includes


Dawson/Stenerson                   32                  Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   the "RRULE" property) or a list of date and local time values (i.e.,
   includes the "RDATE" property), one or more "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   components MUST be specified, such that for the given range of the
   recurrence (i.e., the earliest instance to latest instance), there is
   valid time zone information for all instances. In other words, if all
   of the instances of the pattern is entirely within one offset
   observance, (e.g., all are in Standard Time), only one "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar component need be present. If a time zone transition is
   crossed, then other "VTIMEZONE" calendar components are needed.
   Further, if there are known changes to the rules for the time zone,
   even more "VTIMEZONE" calendar components are needed.

   Each "VTIMEZONE" calendar component consists of several properties:

   The "DAYLIGHT" property is a BOOLEAN value indicating Standard Time
   (FALSE) or Daylight Savings Time (TRUE). The default for DAYLIGHT is
   FALSE or Standard Time.

   The "DTSTART" property in this usage is a fully specified DATE-TIME
   value, including the UTC offset, indicating the effective start date
   and time for the time zone information. For example, 19671029T020000-
   0400 represents the time at which the transition to Standard Time
   took effect in 1967 for the eastern United States.

   The "TZOFFSET" property is a UTC-OFFSET value indicating the UTC
   offset for the time zone (Standard Time or Daylight Savings Time).

   The "TZNAME" property is the customary name for the time zone.

   The "RRULE" property indicates the recurrence rule for the transition
   to this time zone. For example, in the United States, the transition
   from Standard Time to Daylight Saving Time occurs on the first Sunday
   in April at 02:00. If a recurrence rule describing the transition is
   known to have an effective end date, the UNTIL recurrence rule
   parameter is used to specify that end date and time. If the
   recurrence rule for a particular observance (Daylight Saving Time) is
   changing, then the UNTIL of the first rule will be equal to the last
   valid instance (the last date-time) of this particular rule. See
   example below.

   Alternatively, the "RDATE" property can be used. The "RDATE" property
   is a property that indicates the individual dates and/or times that
   the transition takes effect. The values supplied for "RDATE" property
   for each "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST provide valid time zone
   information of all instances of the recurrence specified for the
   calendar component to which this time zone information is to be
   applied.

   The following are examples of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component:

   This is a simple example showing time zone information for the
   Eastern United States using "RDATE" property. Note that this is only
   suitable for a recurring event that starts on or later than 1997,
   April 6, at 02:00:00 EST (i.e., the earliest effective transition

   date and time) and ends no later than 1998, April 7, 02:00:00 EST
   (i.e., latest valid date and time for EST in this scenario).  For
   example, this can be used for a recurring event that ocurrs every
   Friday, 8am-9am, starting June 1, 1997, ending Dec 31, 1997.

     BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
     DAYLIGHT:FALSE
     RDATE:19971026T020000-0400
     TZOFFSET:-0500
     TZNAME:EST
     END:VTIMEZONE

     BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
     DAYLIGHT:TRUE
     RDATE:19970406T020000-0500
     TZOFFSET:-0400
     TZNAME:EDT
     END:VTIMEZONE

   This is a simple example showing the current time zone rules for the
   Eastern United States using a RRULE recurrence pattern. Note that
   there is no effective end date to either of the Standard Time or
   Daylight Time rules. This information would be valid for a
   recurrening event starting today and continuing on into the known
   future.

     BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
     DAYLIGHT:FALSE
     DTSTART:19671029T020000-0400
     RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=-1SU;BYMONTH=10
     TZOFFSET:-0500
     TZNAME:EST
     END:VTIMEZONE

     BEGIN:VTIMEZONE

     RRULE: FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=1SU;BYMONTH=4
     TZOFFSET:-0400
     TZNAME:EDT
     END:VTIMEZONE

   This is an example showing a ficticious set of rules for the Eastern
   United States, where the Daylight Time rule has an effective end date
   (i.e., after that date, Daylight Time is no longer observed).

     BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
     DAYLIGHT:FALSE
     DTSTART:19671029T020000-0400

     TZOFFSET:-0400
     TZNAME:EDT
     END:VTIMEZONE

   This is an example showing a fictitious set of rules for the Eastern
   United States, where the first Daylight Time rule has an effective
   end date. There is a second Daylight Time rule that picks up where
   the other left off.

4.5     Calendar Properties


   The Calendar Properties are attributes that apply to the iCalendar
   object, as a whole. These properties do not appear within a calendar
   component. They should be specified after the "BEGIN:VCALENDAR"
   property and prior to any calendar component.

4.5.1   Calendar Scale


   This property is identified by the property name CALSCALE. This
   property defines the calendar scale used for the calendar information
   specified in the iCalendar object. This memo is based on the
   Gregorian calendar scale. The Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if
   this property is not specified in the iCalendar object. It is
   expected that other calendar scales will be defined in other
   specifications or by future versions of this memo.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   The property is defined by the following notation:

     calscale   = "CALSCALE" ":" [ws] calvalue CRLF

     calvalue   = "GREGORIAN" / iana-scale

     iana-scale = <Any other designator for a calendar scale
                   registered with IANA>

   The following is an example of this property:

     CALSCALE:GREGORIAN

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

4.5.2   Method


   This property is identified by the property name METHOD. This
   property defines the iCalendar object method associated with the
   calendar object. When used in a MIME message entity, the value of
   this property MUST be the same as the Content-Type "method" parameter
   value. This property can only appear once within the iCalendar
   object.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     method     = "METHOD" ": [ws] profvalue CRLF

     profvalue  = <Any IANA registered iCalendar object method.>

   The following is an example of this property when the iCalendar
   object is used to request a meeting:

     METHOD: REQUEST

   In the event that this property is not specified, the iCalendar
   object method is undefined. The data type for this property is TEXT.

4.5.3   Product Identifier


   This property is identified by the property name PRODID. This
   property specifies the identifier for the product that created the
   iCalendar object. The vendor of the implementation should assure that
   this is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such as an
   ISO 9070 FPI value. This calendar property MUST be specified in the
   iCalendar object but can only appear once.

   This property should not be used to alter the interpretation of an
   iCalendar object beyond the semantics specified in this memo. For
   example, it is not to be used to further the understanding of non-
   standard properties.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     prodid     = "PRODID" ":" [ws] pidvalue CRLF

     pidvalue   = text
     ;Any text that describes the product and version
     ;and that is generally assured of being unique.

   The following is an example of this property:

     PRODID:-//ABC Corporation//NONSGML My Product//EN

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

4.5.4   Source


   This property is identified by the property name SOURCE. This
   property is defined by the [MIME DIR] memo. In this memo, the
   property identifies the URL for the source of the iCalendar object.
   The URL is useful for accessing the iCalendar object using a calendar
   access protocol.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     source     = "SOURCE" ":" [ws] url CRLF

   The following are examples of this property:

     SOURCE:http://xyz.corp.com/corp-cals/1997-events.or4

     SOURCE:http://xyz.corp.com/calendars/~jdoe

   The data type for this property is URL.

4.5.5   Source Name


   This property is identified by the property name NAME. This property
   is defined by the [MIME DIR] memo. The property identifies the
   displayable, presentation name for the source of the iCalendar
   object. The source name is a useful text to associate in the user-
   interface of an application with the value in the SOURCE property.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     name       = "NAME" ":" [ws] text CRLF

   The following is an example of this property:

     NAME:1997 Events Calendar for XYZ Corporation

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

4.5.6   Version


   This property is identified by the property name VERSION. This
   property specifies the identifier corresponding to the highest
   version number or the minimum and maximum range of the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type specification supported by
   the implementation that created the iCalendar object. A value of
   "2.0" corresponds to this memo. This calendar property MUST appear
   within the iCalendar object but can only appear once.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     version    = "VERSION" ":" [ws] vervalue CRLF

     vervalue   = "2.0"         ;This memo
                / maxver
                / (minver ";" [ws] maxver)

     minver     = <A IANA registered iCalendar version identifier>
     ;Minimum iCalendar version used to create the iCalendar object

     maxver     = <A IANA registered iCalendar version identifier>
     ;Maximum iCalendar version used to create the iCalendar object

   The following is an example of this property:

     VERSION:2.0

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

4.6     Component Properties


   The following properties MAY appear within calendar components, as
   specified by each component property definition.

4.6.1   Attachment


   This property is identified by the property name ATTACH. The property
   provides the capability to associate an external object with a
   calendar component. For example, a document to be reviewed at a
   scheduled event or the description of the process steps for a to-do.
   The property MAY only be specified within "VEVENT", "VTODO", or
   "VJOURNAL" calendar components. This property MAY be specified
   multiple times within an iCalendar object.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     attach     = "ATTACH" ":" [ws] url CRLF

   The following are examples of this property:

     ATTACH:CID:jsmith.part3.960817T083000.xyzMail@host1.com

     ATTACH:FTP://xyzCorp.com/pub/reports/r-960812.ps

   The data type for this property is URL.

4.6.2   Attendee


   This property is identified by the property name ATTENDEE. The
   property defines an attendee within a calendar component. The
   property MAY only be specified within the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL" and "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   The property has the property parameters TYPE, for the type of
   attendee, ROLE, for the intended role of the attendee; STATUS, for
   the status of the attendee’s participation; RSVP, for indicating
   whether the favor of a reply is requested; EXPECT, to indicate the
   expectation of the attendee’s participation by the originator;
   MEMBER, to indicate the groups that the attendee belongs to;
   DELEGATED-TO, to indicate the people that the original request was
   delegated to; and DELEGATED-FROM, to indicated whom the request was
   delegated from.

   A recipient delegated a request MUST inherit the RSVP and EXPECT
   values from the attendee that delegated the request to them.

   Multiple attendees MAY be specified by including multiple "ATTENDEE"
   properties within the MIME calendaring entity.

   The property data type default is CAL-ADDRESS. The property data type
   MAY also be set to URL. This provides a useful mechanism to allow
   more than just the address of the attendee to be referenced. If the
   value is a URL, then it MUST be able to be resolved to a calendar
   address.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     attendee   = "ATTENDEE" [";" [ws] paramlist]
                  [";" [ws] attparamlist] ":" [ws]
                  (cal-address / URL) CRLF
     ;Value MUST match default or explicit data type

     attparamlist      = (attparam *(";" attparam)

     attparam   = typeparm / roleparm / statusparm / rsvpparm

4.6.4   Classification


   This property is identified by the property name CLASS. This property
   defines the access classification for a calendar component. The
   property MAY only be specified in a "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL"
   calendar component. The property MAY only be specified once.

   An access classification is only one component of the general
   security system within a calendar application. It provides a method
   of capturing the scope of the access the calendar owner intends for
   information within an individual calendar entry. The access
   classification of an individual iCalendar component is useful when
   measured along with the other security components of a calendar
   system (e.g., calendar user authentication, authorization, access
   rights, access role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual
   access classifications can not be completely defined by this memo
   alone. Additionally, due to the "blind" nature of most exchange
   processes using this memo, these access classifications can not serve
   as an enforcement statement for a system receiving an iCalendar
   object . Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of
   the calendar owner for the access to the calendar component. . The
   [ICMS] provides a broader description of the security system within a
   calendar application.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     class      = "CLASS" [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws]
                  classvalue CRLF

     classvalue = "PUBLIC" / "PRIVATE" / "CONFIDENTIAL" / x-token
     ;Default is PUBLIC

   The following is an example of this property:

     CLASS:PUBLIC

4.6.10  Date/Time End


   This property is identified by the property name DTEND. This property
   MAY be specified within the "VEVENT", "VFREEBUSY", and "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar components.

   Within the "VEVENT" calendar component, this property defines the end
   date and time for the event. The property is REQUIRED in "VEVENT"
   calendar components. The time can either be in local time, local time
   with UTC offset or UTC time. The local time is only to be used to
   specify date and time values that do not need to be fixed. A
   recipient MUST assume their own time zone for data and time values
   that do not include time zone information. The value MUST be later in
   time than the value of the "DTSTART" property.

   Within the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, this property defines the
   end date and time for the free or busy time information. The time
   MUST be specified in local time with UTC offset or UTC time. The
   value MUST be later in time than the value of the "DTSTART" property.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

4.6.11  Date/Time Stamp


   This property is identified by the property name DTSTAMP. This
   property specifies an UTC date/time stamp. The property indicates the
   date/time that the iCalendar object instance was created. This
   property MUST be included in "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" and
   "VFREEBUSY" calendar components to permit the recipient to know when
   the iCalendar object was created.

   This property is also useful to protocols such as [IMIP] that have
   inherent latency issues with the delivery of content. This property
   will assist in the proper sequencing of messages containing iCalendar
   objects.

   This property is different than the "CREATED" and "LAST-MODIFIED"
   properties. These two properties are used to specify when the
   calendar service information was created and last modified. This is
   different than when the iCalendar object representation of the
   calendar service information was created or last modified.

4.6.16  Exception Date/Times


   This property is identified by the property name EXDATE. This
   property defines the list of date/time exceptions for a recurring
   "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component. The times can
   either be in local time, local time with UTC offset or UTC time.

   The exception dates, if specified, is used in computing the
   recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence
   instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated
   by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RRULE",
   "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained within the
   iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance
   in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
   properties MAY also be specified to define more sophisticated
   recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
   all of the start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
   and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date and times which
   fall within the union of start date and times generated by any
   specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start
   date and times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
   and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
   properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
   generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
   is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     exdate     = "EXDATE" [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws] [date-time /
                  date] *("," [ws] date-time/date) CRLF
     ;Values MUST match the specified value type.

   The following is an example of this property:

4.6.17  Exception Rule


   This property is identified by the property name EXRULE. This
   property defines a rule or repeating pattern for an exception to a
   recurrence set. This property MAY only be specified in the "VEVENT",
   "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   The exception rule, if specified, is used in computing the recurrence
   set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence instances
   for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated by
   considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RRULE",
   "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained within the
   iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" defines the first instance in the
   recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
   properties MAY also be specified to define more sophisticated
   recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
   all of the start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
   and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date and times which
   fall within the union of start date and times generated by any
   specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start
   date and times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
   and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
   properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
   generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
   is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     exrule     = "EXRULE" [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws] recur CRLF

   The following are examples of this property. Except every other week,
   on Tuesday and Thursday for 4 occurrences:

   The date and time is either local time with UTC offset or a UTC
   value.

   The "FREEBUSY" property MAY include the "TYPE" property parameter to
   specify whether the information defines a free or busy time interval.
   The default "TYPE" property parameter value is BUSY. The property MAY
   also include the "STATUS" property parameter to provide added
   information about the busy time. For example, if the busy time is
   associated with a time interval that would be unavailable for
   scheduling - - in any case - - or busy time that has been tentatively
   scheduled. The default "STATUS" property parameter value is BUSY. The
   property is defined by the following notation:

   should be sorted in ascending order, based on start time and then end
   time, with the earliest periods first.

   The "FREEBUSY" property MAY specify more than one value, separated by
   the COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). In such cases, the "FREEBUSY"
   property values should all be of the same "STATUS" property parameter
   type (e.g., all values of a particular "STATUS" listed together in a
   single property).

   The data type for this property is PERIOD.

4.6.19  Geographic Position


   This property is identified by the property name GEO. This property
   specifies information related to the global position for a "VEVENT"
   or "VTODO" calendar component. The property value specifies latitude
   and longitude, in that order (i.e., "LAT LON" ordering). The
   longitude represents the location east and west of the prime meridian
   as a positive or negative real number, respectively. The latitude
   represents the location north and south of the equator as a positive
   or negative real number, respectively. The longitude and latitude
   values MUST be specified as decimal degrees and should be specified
   to six decimal places. This will allow for granularity within a meter
   of the geographical position. The simple formula for converting
   degrees-minutes-seconds into decimal degrees is:

     decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     geo        = "GEO" ":" [ws] geovalue CRLF

     geovalue   = float ";" [ws] float
     ;Latitude and Longitude components

   The following is an example of this property:

     GEO:37.386013;-122.082932

   The default data type for this property is FLOAT.

4.6.20  Last Modified


   This property is identified by the property name LAST-MODIFIED. The
   property specifies the date and time that the calendar information
   was last revised. This property MAY be specified in the "VEVENT",
   "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components. The data and
   time MUST be a UTC value.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     last-mod   = "LAST-MODIFIED" ":" [ws] date-time CRLF

   The following is are examples of this property:

     LAST-MODIFIED:19960817T133000Z

   The data type for this property is DATE-TIME.

4.6.21  Location


   This property is identified by the property name LOCATION. The
   property defines the intended location for the "VEVENT" or "VTODO"

   calendar component. The property MAY only be specified within a
   "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     location   = "LOCATION [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws] locavalue
                  CRLF

     locavalue  = text / url    ;The value MUST be the same type as the
                                ;default or explicit data type.

   The following are some examples of this property:

     LOCATION:Conference Room - F123, Bldg. 002

     LOCATION;VALUE=URL:http://www.xyzcorp.com/~jsmith.vcf

   The default data type for this property is TEXT. The data type MAY be
   reset to URL. In the case of the data type being URL, the property
   value MAY reference a vCard object. This provides a useful mechanism
   to specify a location in terms of its electronic business card.

4.6.22  Percent Complete


   This property is identified by the property name PERCENT-COMPLETE.
   This property is used by an assignee or delegatee of a to-do to
   convey the percent completion of a to-do to the Organizer. The
   property MAY only be specified once and within a "VTODO" calendar
   component. The property value is an integer between zero and one
   hundred. A value of "0" indicates the to-do has not yet been started.
   A value of "100" indicates that the to-do has been completed. Integer
   values in between indicate the percent partially complete.

   When a to-do is assigned to multiple individuals, the property value
   indicates the percent complete for that portion of the to-do assigned
   to the assignee or delegatee. For example, if a to-do is assigned to
   both individuals "A" and "B". A reply from "A" with a percent
   complete of "70" indicates that "A" has completed 70% of the to-do
   assigned to them. A reply from "B" with a percent complete of "50"
   indicates "B" has completed 50% of the to-do assigned to them.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     percent = "PERCENT-COMPLETE" ":" [ws] integer CRLF

   The following is an example of this property to show 39% completion:

     PERCENT-COMPLETE:39

   The data type for this property is INTEGER.

4.6.23  Priority


   This property is identified by the property name PRIORITY. The
   property defines the priority for event or to-do. The property MAY
   only be specified within a "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.
   The value is an integer. A value of zero (ASCII decimal 48) specifies
   an undefined priority. A value of one (ASCII decimal 49) is the
   highest priority. A value of two (ASCII decimal 50) is the second
   highest priority. Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing ordinal
   priority.

   The property is specified by the following notation:

     priority   = "PRIORITY" ":" [ws] integer CRLF
     ;Default is zero

   The following is an example of this property:

     PRIORITY:2

   The data type for this property is INTEGER.

4.6.24  Recurrence Date/Times


   This property is identified by the property name RDATE. This property
   defines the list of date/times for a recurrence set. The property MAY
   only appear within the "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar components. This property MAY appear along with the "RRULE"
   property to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences. When
   they both appear in an iCalendar object, the recurring events are
   defined by the union of occurrences defined by both the "RDATE" and
   "RRULE". The times can either be in local time, local time with UTC
   offset or UTC based time. If local time is used, the "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar component MUST be included in the iCalendar object,
   otherwise the local time value will be interpreted relative to the
   time zone of the recipient. The period values for "RDATE" property
   are specified using a specific start and a specific end basic format
   (period-explicit) or the period with a specific start and a specific
   duration basic format (period-start).

   The recurrence dates, if specified, is used in computing the
   recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence
   instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated
   by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RRULE",
   "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained within the
   iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance
   in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
   properties MAY also be specified to define more sophisticated
   recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
   all of the start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
   and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date and times which
   fall within the union of start date and times generated by any
   specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start

   date and times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
   and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
   properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
   generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
   is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     rdate      = "RDATE" [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws] rdvalue
                  *("," [ws] rdvalue) CRLF

     rdvalue    = date-time / date / period
     ;Value MUST match the specified data type

   The following are examples of this property:

     RDATE:19970714T083000-0400

     RDATE;VALUE=PERIOD:19960403T020000Z/19960403T040000Z,

   The default data type for this property is DATE-TIME. The data type
   MAY be reset to DATE or PERIOD.

4.6.25  Recurrence ID


   This property is identified by the property name RECURRENCE-ID. This
   property identifies a specific instance of a recurring "VEVENT",
   "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component. The property value is the
   effective value of the "DTSTART" property of the recurrence instance.
   The time of day component for the value MUST be either an UTC or a
   local time with UTC offset time format, unless the original calendar
   object was expressed as a "floating" calendar object; that is in
   local time with no time zone calendar component specified. If the
   value of the "DTSTART" property is a DATE type value, then the value
   MUST be the calendar date for the recurrence instance.

   The date/time value is set to the time when the original recurrence
   instance would occur - - meaning that if the intent is to change a
   Friday meeting to Thursday, the date/time is still set to the
   original Friday meeting.

   The "RECURRENCE-ID" property is used in conjunction with the "UID"
   property to identify a particular instance of a recurring event, to-
   do or journal.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     recurid    = "RECURRENCE-ID" [";" [ws] rangeparm] [";" [ws]
                  paramlist] ":" [ws] [date-time / date]

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


     rangeparm  = "RANGE" "=" ("THISANDPRIOR" / "THISANDFUTURE")

   The default value for the range parameter is the single recurrence
   instance only.

   The following are examples of this property:

     RECURRENCE-ID:19960401T235959Z

     RECURRENCE-ID;RANGE=THISANDFUTURE:19960120T120000Z

   This default data type for this property is DATE-TIME. The data type
   MAY be reset to DATE.

4.6.26  Recurrence Rule


   This property is identified by the property name RRULE. This property
   defines a rule or repeating pattern for a recurring events, to-dos,
   or time zone definitions. The property MAY be specified in the
   "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components. The
   data type for this property is RECUR.

   The recurring rule, if specified, is used in computing the recurrence
   set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence instances
   for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated by
   considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RRULE",
   "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained within the
   iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance
   in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
   properties MAY also be specified to define more sophisticated
   recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
   all of the start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
   and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date and times which
   fall within the union of start date and times generated by any
   specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start
   date and times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
   and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
   properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
   generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
   is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The "DTSTART" and "DTEND" property pair or "DTSTART" and "DURATION"
   property pair, specified within the iCalendar object defines the
   first instance of the recurrence. When used with a recurrence rule,
   the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties MUST be specified in local time
   and the appropriate set of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components MUST be
   included. For detail on the usage of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component, see the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component definition.

   Any duration associated with the iCalendar object applies to all
   members of the generated recurrence. Any modified duration for
   specific recurrences would have to be explicitly specified using the
   "RDATE" property.

4.6.27  Related To


   This property is identified by the property name RELATED-TO. The
   property is used to represent relationships or references between one
   calendar component and another. The property MAY only be specified in
   the "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.
   The property value consists of the persistent, globally unique

   identifier of another calendar component. This value would be
   represented in a calendar component by the "UID" property. The
   property value always points to another calendar component that has a
   "parent" relationship to the referencing object.

   A linked relationship can be specified by a series of components that
   each, in turn, refer to their parent component. A group relationship
   can be specified by a number of components that all refer to one
   common parent component.

   Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property MAY
   impact the related calendar component. For example, if a group event
   changes its start or end date or time, then the related, dependent
   events will need to have their start and end dates changed in a
   corresponding way. This property is intended only to provide
   information on the relationship of calendar components. It is up to
   the target calendar system to maintain any property implications of
   this relationship.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     related    = "RELATED-TO" [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws] uid CRLF

   The following is an example of this property:

     RELATED-TO:<jsmith.part7.19960817T083000.xyzMail@host3.com>

     RELATED-TO:<19960401-080045-4000F192713-0052@host1.com>

   The data type for this property is UID.

4.6.28  Repeat Count


   This property is identified by the property name REPEAT. This
   property defines the number of repetitions for an alarm.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     repeatcnt  = "REPEAT" ":" [ws] integer CRLF
     ;Default is "1".

   The following is an example of this property:

     REPEAT:4

   The data type for the property is INTEGER.

4.6.29  Request Status


   This property is identified by the property name REQUEST-STATUS. This
   property defines the status code returned for a scheduling request.
   This property is used to return status code information related to

   the processing of an associated iCalendar object. The data type for
   this property is TEXT.

   The value consists of a short return status, a longer return status
   description, and optionally the offending data. The components of the
   value are separated by the SEMICOLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

   The short return status is a PERIOD character (ASCII decimal xx)
   separated set of integers. For example, "3.1.1". The successive
   levels of integers provide for a successive level of status code
   granularity.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     Rstatus    = "REQUEST-STATUS" ":" [ws] statcode ";" [ws]
                         statdesc [";" [ws] extdata]

     Statcode   = 1*DIGIT *("." 1*DIGIT)
     ;Hierarchical, numeric return status code

     Statdesc   = *WORD
     ;Textual status description

     Extdata    = *WORD
     ;Textual exception data. For example, the offending property
     ;name and value or complete property line.

   The following are some possible examples of this property (Note: The
   BACKSLASH character escapement of separator characters in a property
   value):

     REQUEST-STATUS:2.0;Success

     REQUEST-STATUS:3.1;Invalid property value;DTSTART:96-Apr-01

     REQUEST-STATUS:2.8; Success\, repeating event ignored. Scheduled
      as a single event.;RRULE\:FREQ=WEEKLY\;INTERVAL=2

     REQUEST-STATUS:4.1;Event conflict. Date/time is busy.

     REQUEST-STATUS:3.7;Invalid calendar user;ATTENDEE\:
      jsmith@host.com

   The following are valid classes for the return status code.
   Individual iCalendar object methods will define specific return
   status codes for these classes.

   "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. This property
   is needed to properly handle the receipt and processing of a sequence
   of calendar components that have been delivered out of order. Such is
   the case for store-and-forward based transports. The first request is
   created with a sequence number of "0" (ASCII decimal 48). It is
   incremented each time the ORGANIZER or OWNER issues a revision to the
   request. The sequence number MUST be monotonically incremented when
   one of the following properties in a calendar component is changed:

     · "DTSTART"
     · "DTEND"
     · "DUE"
     · "RDATE"
     · "RRULE"
     · "EXDATE"

   This property is identified by the property name URL. This property
   defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) associated with the
   iCalendar object. This property MAY be specified in the "VEVENT",
   "VTODO", "VJOURNAL", "VFREEBUSY", and "VALARM" calendar components.

   The property is defined by the following notation:




Dawson/Stenerson                   68                  Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


     url        = "URL" ":" [ws] url CRLF

   The following is an example of this property:

     URL:http://abc.com/pub/calendars/jsmith/mytime.or3

   The data type for this property is URL.

4.6.38  Unique Identifier


   This property is identified by the property name UID. This property
   defines the persistent, globally unique identifier for the calendar
   component. The property MUST be specified in the "VEVENT", "VTODO"
   and "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   The UID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier. The generator of
   the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is unique. There
   are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish this. The
   identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the [RFC 822]
   addr-spec. A good method to assure uniqueness is to put the domain
   name or a domain literal IP address of the host on which the
   identifier was created on the right hand side of the "@", and on the
   left hand side, put a combination of the current calendar date and
   time of day (i.e., formatted in as a DATE-TIME value) along with some
   other currently unique (perhaps sequential) identifier available on
   the system (for example, a process id number). Using a date/time
   value on the left hand side and a domain name or domain literal on
   the right hand side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since
   no two hosts should be using the same domain name or IP address at
   the same time. Though other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the right hand side contain some domain identifier (either of
   the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message
   identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side within
   the scope of that domain.

   This identifier is created by the calendar system that generates an
   iCalendar object. The identifier is represented as a text value. This
   is the method for correlating scheduling messages with the referenced
   event, to-do, or journal.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     uid        = "UID" ":" [ws] text CRLF

   The following is an example of this property:

     UID:19960401T080045Z-4000F192713-0052@host1.com

   This property is an important method for group scheduling
   applications to match requests with later replies, modifications or
   deletion requests. Calendaring and scheduling applications MUST
   generate this property in "VEVENT", "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL" calendar

   components to assure interoperability with other group scheduling
   applications.

   Implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at
   least 255 characters for this property.

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

4.6.39  Non-standard Properties


   The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type provides a "standard
   mechanism for doing non-standard things". This extension support is
   provided for implementers to "push the envelope" on the existing
   version of the memo. Extension properties are specified by property
   and/or property parameter names that have the prefix text of "X-"
   (the two character sequence: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X character
   followed by the HYPEN-MINUS character). It is RECOMMENDED that
   vendors concatenate onto this sentinel another short prefix text to
   identify the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the
   extensions and minimize possible collision of names between different
   vendors. User agents that support this content type are expected to
   be able to parse the extension properties and property parameters but
   MAY ignore them.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     extension  = "X-" [vendorid] "-" word [";" [ws] paramlist] ":" [ws]
                  value

     vendorid   = 3*char        ;Vendor identification prefix text

   The following might be the ABC vendor’s extension for an audio-clip
   form of subject property:

     X-ABC-MMSUBJ;TYPE=WAVE; VALUE=URL: http://load.noise.org/mysubj.wav

   At present, there is no registration authority for names of extension
   properties and property parameters. The data type for this property
   is TEXT. Optionally, the data type MAY be any of the other valid data
   types.

5.      Recommended Practices


   These recommended practices should be followed in order to assure
   consistent handling of the following cases for an iCalendar object.

   1.      A calendar entry with a "DTSTART" property but no "DTEND" property
     - The event does not take up any time. It is intended to represent
     an event that is associated with a given calendar date and time of
     day, such as an anniversary. Since the event does not take up any
     time, it MUST NOT be used to record busy time no matter what the
     value for the "TRANSP" property.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   2.      When the "DTSTART" and "DTEND", for "VEVENT", "VJOURNAL" and
     "VFREEBUSY" calendar components, and "DTSTART" and "DUE", for
     "VTODO" calendar components, have the same value data type (e.g.,
     DATE-TIME), they should specify values in the same time format
     (e.g., local time with UTC offset).

   3.      A combination of "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties that produces more
     than one instance for a given date/time - Only one recurrence can
     occur on a given date/time interval. Just one instance for the
     date/time is recorded.

   4.      A particular iCalendar object method that specifies "ATTENDEE"
     properties with the "MEMBER" property parameter, for which the
     recipient has multiple memberships - Recipient should reply to
     only the first "MEMBER" property parameter value that it can
     match.

6.      Registration of Content Type Elements


   This section provide the process for registration of MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object methods and new or
   modified properties.

6.1     Registration of New and Modified iCalendar object Methods


   New MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object
   methods are registered by the publication of an IETF Request for
   Comment (RFC). Changes to an iCalendar object method are registered
   by the publication of a revision of the RFC defining the method.

6.2     Registration of New Properties


   This section defines procedures by which new properties or enumerated
   property values for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   can be registered with the IANA. Note that non-IANA properties MAY be
   used by bilateral agreement, provided the associated properties names
   follow the "X-" convention.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new properties, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new properties.

   Registration of a new property is accomplished by the following
   steps.

6.2.1   Define the property


   A property is defined by completing the following template.

     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME property XXX



Dawson/Stenerson                   71                  Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


     Property name:

     Property purpose:

     Property data type(s):

     Property encoding:

     Property special notes (optional):

     Intended usage: (one of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)

   The meaning of each field in the template is as follows.

   Property name: The name of the property, as it will appear in the
   body of an text/calendar MIME Content-Type "property: value" line to
   the left of the colon ":".

   Property purpose: The purpose of the property (e.g., to indicate a
   delegate for the event or to-do, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description.

   Property data type(s): Any of the valid data types for the property
   value needs to be specified. The default data type also needs to be
   specified. If a new data type is specified, it needs to be declared
   in this section.

   Property encoding: The encodings permitted for the property value.
   This description MUST be precise and MUST NOT violate the general
   encoding rules defined in this memo.

   Property special notes: Any special notes about the property, how it
   is to be used, etc.

6.2.2   Post the Property definition


   The property description MUST be posted to the new property
   discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

6.2.3   Allow a comment period


   Discussion on the new property MUST be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus MUST be reached on the
   property before proceeding to the next step.

6.2.4   Submit the property for approval


   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the property, the
   registration application should be submitted to the Method Reviewer
   for approval. The Method Reviewer is appointed to the Application
   Area Directors and MAY either accept or reject the property
   registration. An accepted registration should be passed on by the



Dawson/Stenerson                   72                  Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     October 22, 1997


   Method Reviewer to the IANA for inclusion in the official IANA method
   registry. The registration MAY be rejected for any of the following
   reasons. 1) Insufficient comment period; 2) Consensus not reached; 3)
   Technical deficiencies raised on the list or elsewhere have not been
   addressed. The Method Reviewer's decision to reject a property MAY be
   appealed by the proposer to the IESG, or the objections raised can be
   addressed by the proposer and the property resubmitted.

6.3     Property Change Control


   Existing properties MAY be changed using the same process by which
   they were registered.

        1.           Define the change

        2.           Post the change

        3.           Allow a comment period

        4.           Submit the property for approval

   Note that the original author or any other interested party MAY
   propose a change to an existing property, but that such changes
   should only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in
   the published memo. The Method Reviewer MAY object to a change if it
   is not backwards compatible, but is not required to do so.

   Property definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   properties which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.

7.      File extension


   The file extension of "vcs" is to be used to designate a file
   containing calendaring and scheduling information consistent with
   this MIME content type.

8.      Macintosh File Type Code


   The file type code of "vcal" is to be used in Apple MacIntosh
   operating system environments to designate a file containing
   calendaring and scheduling information consistent with this MIME
   media type.
