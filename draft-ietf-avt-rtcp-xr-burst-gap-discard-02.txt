1.  Introduction

1.1.  Burst and Gap Discard Report Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the proportion of packets discarded by the
   receiver due to jitter.  The discards during discard bursts are
   reported, together with the number of bursts and additional data
   allowing the calculation of statistical parameters (mean and
   variance) of the distribution of burst lengths.  This block is
   intended to be used in conjunction with [DISCARD] which provides the
   total packets discarded, and on which this block therefore depends.
   However the metric in [DISCARD] may be used independently of the
   metrics in this block.

   This block provides information on transient IP problems.  Burst/Gap
   metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports however MAY be used
   in Interval reports.  The burstiness of packet discard affects user
   experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the
   problem, and may also have diagnostic value.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal metrics
   defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

   The definitions of Burst, Gap, Loss and Discard are consistent with
   definitions in [RFC3611], with the clarification that Loss and
   Discard are defined in terms of frames.  To accomodate the range of
   jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that may be used by
   implementors, the method used to distinguish between bursts and gaps
   may be an equivalent method to that defined in [RFC3611].

   Instances of this Metrics Block refer by tag to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Identity block [MEASIDENT] which contains
   information such as the SSRC of the measured stream, and RTP sequence
   numbers and time intervals indicating the span of the report.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [PMOLFRAME] provides guidance on
   the definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics

   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [PMOLFRAME].

1.4.  Applicability

   This metric is believed to be applicable to the large class of RTP
   applications which contain jitter buffers.

2.  Definitions

   Received, Lost and Discarded

      A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives within
      this time window but is too early or late to be played out shall
      be regarded as discarded.  A packet shall be classified as one of
      received (or OK), discarded or lost.

   Bursts and Gaps

      The terms Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that
      of RTCP XR [RFC3611].

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Burst/Gap Discard Report Block

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Burst/Gap Discard Report Block is identified by the constant
      NBGD.

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Discard
      metric is an Interval or a Cumulative metric, that is, whether the
      reported value applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).
      Numerical values for both these intervals are provided in the
      Measurement Identifier block referenced by the tag field below.

   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.  The relevant
      Measurement Identifier block has the same tag value as the Burst/
      Gap Discard block.  Note that there may be more than one
      Measurement Identifier block per RTCP packet.

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard               May 2009


   Reserved (resv): 4 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.

   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Burst/Gap Discard block, the block length is equal to 4.

   Threshold: 8 bits

      The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e. the number
      of successive frames that must not be discarded prior to and
      following a discarded frame in order for this discarded frame to
      be regarded as part of a gap.

   Sum of Burst Durations (ms): 24 bits

      The total duration of bursts of discarded frames in the period of
      the report (Interval or Cumulative).

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   Packets discarded in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   Total packets expected in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets expected during discard bursts (that
      is, the sum of received packets and lost packets).

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   Number of bursts: 16 bits

      The number of bursts in the period of the report (Interval or
      Cumulative).

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard               May 2009


      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   Sum of Squares of Burst Durations (ms-squared): 36 bits

      The sum of the squares of burst durations (where individual burst
      durations are expressed in ms) over in the period of the report
      (Interval or Cumulative).  The units for this quantity are
      milliseconds-squared.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFFE
      SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.

3.3.  Derived metrics based on reported metrics

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Identity block (which MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as the
   Burst/Gap Discard block) and also with the metric "number of packets
   discarded" provided in the RTCP XR Discard Block [DISCARD].  The RTCP
   XR Discard Block SHOULD be sent if the Burst/Gap Discard block is
   sent, but the converse does not apply.

   The fraction of packets discarded during bursts is the quotient:
   Packets Discarded in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts

   The fraction of packets discarded during gaps is the quotient:
   (number of packets discarded - Packets Discarded in Bursts) /
   (Packets Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)

   where "number of packets discarded" is obtained from the RTCP XR
   Discard Block [DISCARD] and Packets Expected is calculated as the
   difference between "extended last sequence number" and "extended
   first sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the
   Measurement Identity block [MEASIDENT] associated with this Burst/Gap
   Discard block.

   The mean burst duration is obtained as the quotient:

   mean = Sum of Burst Durations / Number of Bursts

   The variance of the burst duration is obtained using the standard
   result:

   var = ( Sum of Squares of Burst Durations - Number of Bursts * mean^2

4.  Considerations for Voice-over-IP applications

   This metric block is applicable to a broad range of RTP applications.
   Where the metric is used with a Voice-overIP (VoIP) application, the
   following considerations apply.

   RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
   during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
   quality degradation (generally over 5 percent discard rate), and
   gaps, which are periods during which discarded packets are infrequent
   and hence call quality is generally acceptable.

   If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration shall
   be determined as if silence frames had been sent, i.e. a period of
   silence in excess of Gmin frames MUST terminate a burst condition.

   The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611] results in
   a Burst being a period of time during which the call quality is
   degraded to a similar extent to a typical PCM Severely Errored
   Second.

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-bgd-block

   xr-bgd-block = "brst-gap-dscrd"

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NBGD in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Concealed Seconds Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "brst-gap-dscrd" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

6.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
