Abstract

   An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used in
   the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/Multicast
   MPEG2 TS over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.  This document
   defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block
   that allows the reporting of MPEG2 TS decodability statistics metrics
   related to transmissions of MPEG2 TS over RTP.  The metrics specified
   in the RTCP XR Block are related to Program Specific Information
   carried in MPEG TS.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  MPEG2 Transport Stream Decodability Metrics

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has
   defined a set of syntax and information consistency tests and
   corresponding indicators [ETSI] that are recommended for the
   monitoring of MPEG2 Transport Streams [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The
   tests and corresponding indicators are grouped according to priority:

Internet-Draft           RTCP XR TS Decodability             August 2014


   o  First priority - Necessary for decodability (basic monitoring)
   o  Second priority - Recommended for continuous or periodic
      monitoring
   o  Third priority - Recommended for application-dependent monitoring

   This memo defines a new block type for use with MPEG2 Transport
   Stream (TS) [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007], to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611].  The new block type supports reporting of the number of
   occurrences of each Program Specific Information (PSI) indicator in
   the first and second priorities listed by [ETSI] sections 5.2.1 and
   5.2.2 respectively.  Third priority indicators are not supported.
   The metrics defined here supplement information from the PSI-
   independent Decodability Statistics Metrics Block [RFC6990].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guidelines for RTCP XR
   reporting block formats.  The new report block described in this memo
   is in compliance with the monitoring architecture specified in
   [RFC6792] and the Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to any type of RTP application that uses
   the MPEG2 TS standard format for multimedia data, for example, MPEG4
   over MPEG2 TS over RTP.  This new block type can be useful for
   measuring content stream or TS quality by checking TS header
   information [ETSI] and identifying the existence, and characterizing
   the severity, of bitstream packetization problems which may affect
   users' perception of a service delivered over RTP.  It may also be
   useful for verifying the continued correct operation of an existing
   system management tool.

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  MPEG2 TS PSI Decodability Statistics Metrics Block

   ETSI TR 101290 [ETSI] generally defines indicators related to error
   events, while the XR block defined in this document contains counts
   of occurrences of the [ETSI] indicators.  The block defined in this
   document reports MPEG2 TS PSI decodability statistics metrics beyond
   the information carried in the standard RTCP packet format and PSI-
   independent Decodability Metrics Block [RFC6990], which are measured
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  It contains counts of seven
   metrics defined in ETSI TR 101290 [ETSI].  Information is reported
   about basic monitoring parameters necessary to ensure that the TS can
   be decoded including:


   o  Program Association Table (PAT) errors
   o  PAT 2 errors
   o  Program Map Table (PMT) errors
   o  PMT 2 errors
   o  Packet Identifier (PID) errors


   and continuous monitoring parameters necessary to ensure the
   continuous decoding including:


   o  Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) errors
   o  Conditional Access Table (CAT) errors


   In these parameters, PAT 2 errors and PMT 2 errors are actually
   replacements for and improvements on PAT errors and PMT errors
   respectively and are therefore preferred in future implementations.
   In addition, measurement results for some of these parameters (e.g.,
   PAT errors or PMT errors) may be different based on whether
   scrambling is employed.  The other parameters defined in [ETSI]
   Section 5 are ignored since they do not apply to all MPEG2
   implementations.  For further detailed information on these
   parameters, see [ETSI].

   The MPEG2 TS PSI Decodability Metrics Block has the following format:

      A count of the number of PAT errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  The program association table (PAT) is
      the only packet with packet ID (PID) 0x 0000.  A PAT error occurs
      when: (1) a packet with PID 0x0000 does not occur at least every
      0.5 seconds, or (2) a packet with PID 0x0000 does not contain a
      table_id 0x00 (i.e., a PAT), or (3)Scrambling_control_field in the
      TS packet header is not 00 for a packet with PID 0x0000.  See
      section 5.2.1 of [ETSI].  Every program within the MPEG TS stream
      is listed in the PAT; if it is missing, then no programs can be
      decoded.

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.  As indicated in
      the NOTE 1 of the table in the section 5.2.1 of TR101.290, TR
      101.290 recommends using PAT_error_2_count.  Upon reception, If
      PAT_error_2_count is available (that is, other than 0xFFFF), then
      receivers MUST ignore PAT_error_count.

   PAT_error_2_count: 16 bits

      A count of the number of PAT2 errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PAT2 error occurs when: (1) a packet
      with PID 0x0000 containing table_id 0x00 does not occur at least
      every 0.5 seconds,or (2) a packet with PID 0x0000 contains a table
      with table_id other than 0x00, or (3) Scrambling_control_field in
      the TS packet header is not 00 for a packet with PID 0x0000.  See
      section 5.2.1 of [ETSI].

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   PMT_error_count: 16 bits

      A count of the number of PMT_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PMT_error occurs when: (1) a packet
      containing a table with table_id 0x02(i.e.,a PMT) does not occur
      at least every 0.5s on the PID that is referred to in the PAT,
      or(2) Scrambling_control_field in the TS packet header is not 00
      for all packets with PID containing a table with table_id 0x02
      (i.e. a PMT).  See the section 5.2.1 of [ETSI].

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.  As indicated in
      the NOTE 2 of table in the section 5.2.1 of TR101.290, TR 101.290
      recommends using PMT_error_2_count.  Upon reception, If
      PMT_error_2_count is available (that is, other than 0xFFFF), then
      receivers MUST ignore PMT_error_count.

   PMT_error_2_count: 16 bits

      A count of the number of PMT2 errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PMT2_error occurs when: (1) a packet
      containing table_id 0x02(i.e.,a PMT) does not occur at least every
      0.5s on each program_map_PID which is referred to in the PAT, or
      (2) Scrambling_control_field in the TS packet header is not 00 for
      all packets containing a table with table_id 0x02 (i.e. a PMT) on
      each program_map_PID which is referred to in the PAT.  See section
      5.2.1 of [ETSI].

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   PID_error_count: 16 bits

      A count of the number of PID_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PID error occurs when no data stream
      is present corresponding to a given PID.  This may be caused by
      multiplexing or demultiplexing, then remultiplexing.  See section
      5.2.1 of [ETSI].

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   CRC_error_count: 16 bits

      A count of the number of CRC_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A CRC_error occurs if data corruption
      occurred in any of the following tables -- CAT, PAT, PMT, Network
      Information Table (NIT), Event Information Table (EIT), Bouquet
      Association Table (BAT), Service Description Table (SDT) or Time
      Offset Table (TOT), as defined in the section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   CAT_error_count: 16 bits

      A count of the number of CAT_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A CAT_error occurs when: (1) a packet
      with PID 0x0001 contains a table with table_id other than
      0x01(i.e.,not a CAT), or (2) A packet does not contain a table
      with table_id = 0x01 (i.e. a CAT) when scrambling is employed
      ((i.e., scrambling_control field is set as a value other than
      00)).  See the section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   Reserved: 16 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders
      ignored by receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2).


4.  SDP Signaling

   RFC 3611 defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of RTCP XR blocks.  However XR blocks
   MAY be used without prior signaling (See section 5 of RFC3611).

4.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in
   Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 by providing an additional value of "xr-
   format" to signal the use of the report block defined in this
   document.

   xr-format =/  xr-tpd-block

   xr-tpd-block = "ts-psi-decodability"

4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

4.3.  Usage Outside of Offer/Answer

   For usage outside of Offer/Answer,refer to section 5.3 of [RFC3611].

5.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of RFC 3611.

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value MTPD in the IANA " RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry " to

   the "MPEG2 Transport Stream PSI Decodability Statistics Metrics
   Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace MTPD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "ts-psi-decodability" in
   the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:
